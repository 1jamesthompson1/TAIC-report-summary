 About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of 
inquiry and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation 
and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, an d co-ordinating and co -operating with 
other accident investigation organisations overseas.  
The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of 
occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future. It is n ot the 
Commission's purpose to ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (or to assist an 
agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or agency. However, 
the Commission will not refrain from fully reporting on the circu mstances and factors 
contributing to an accident because fault or liability may be inferred from the findings.

Verbal probability expressions  
Where possible, the Commission uses standardised terminology in its reports. This is for the 
benefit of investigation participants, readers of its reports, and recipients of its 
recommendations. One ex ample of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe 
the degree of probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in 
support of a hypothesis.  
This terminology, set out in the table below, has been adopted by the Com mission based on 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau 
models. The Commission chose these models due their simplicity, usability, and international 
use. The Commission considers the suitability of these models  as being reflective of the 
Commission's functions, which include the making of findings and recommendations based 
on a wide range of evidence received, whether or not that evidence would be admissible in a 
Court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
What happened  
1.1 On 5 July 2020, the log carrier Funing  finished loading its cargo at the Port of Tauranga 
and began preparations for departure.  At about 2200 the officer of the watch 
contacted the engineers and informed them that departure was planned for midnight . 
1.2 When the main engine was tested in the aster n direction , the main engine fault log 
indicated there was a  fuel injection quantity piston failure.   
1.3 The engineering team attempted to rectify the fault but  were unable to before the 
vessel departed its berth at about 0018 , when  the fault reoccurred again on the main 
engine . 
1.4 At 0024 the tugs were let go, and at 0027 the Port of Tauranga  harbour pilot ordered 
full ahead. The vessel's speed through the water was about 4.3  knots.  
1.5 By 0043 the vessel's  speed through the water was about 0 knots, a nd its speed over 
the ground was about the same as the ebbing tidal stream of 3.5 knots. The vessel was 
effectively drifting with the current and moving out of the channel . 
1.6 Shortly afterwards the vessel drifted over channel marker 'B' buoy and the buoy's 
mooring chain became entangled in  the Funing 's rudder and propeller.  
Why it happened  
1.7 The engineers identified a fault with the main engine during pre -departure testing, but 
they did not confirm it was rectified before depart ure. 
1.8 Ineffective  communication between the master and chief engineer meant the bridge 
team were not fully aware of the problem with the main engine, nor its implications  in 
respect of vessel manoeuvrability .  
1.9 The main engine  defect  was not accounted for during the bridge team's preparation 
for departure, and therefore the harbour pilot was also unaware of the defect.  
1.10 The main engine fault was very likely due to the effect of low-sulphur  fuel on the 
injection control unit.  
What we can learn  
1.11 The role that bridge resource man agement and engine room resource management 
play in respect of the safety of a vessel  cannot be overstated.  Good communication  
between departments  is a core principle  that may, had it been implemented on this 
occasion, have caused the master to reconsider the planned departure time.   
Who may benefit  
1.12 Vessel owners, operators, maintenance teams and crew. Port operators and marine 
pilots.

 2 Factual information   
Narrative  
2.1 On the afternoon of 5 July 2020 , the log carrier Funing  finished loading its cargo of 
logs and began preparations for departure . At about 2200 the officer of the watch  
(OOW)  on the bridge called the engine room  and gave the engineers notice of 
departure at midnight.   
2.2 The second and third engineers began conducting pre -departure checks . The chief 
engineer arrived in the engine room at about 2215 .  
2.3 At about  2225 the duty engineer  officer  called the bridge and asked permission to 
blow  through the main engine 0F1 using air.  
2.4 At about 2228 , as part of pre-depa rture testing, the main engine was tested in the 
ahead and astern direction s from the engine room. When it was tested in the astern 
direction , the main engine fault log indicated there was a fuel injection quan tity piston 
failure on number two cylinder . 
2.5 Engineers  removed the quantity piston cover , cleaned the piston rod and sensor with 
lubricant  and reset the main engine slowdown alarm 1F2  
2.6 At 224 0 an engineer called the bridge to transfer control of the main engine to bridge 
control , allowing  the OOW  to test the engine ahead and astern  of the bridge . The 
bridge logbook noted at 2241, "engine tested ahead and astern ok" . Shortly 
afterwards, at the chief engineer 's instruction, control of the main engine reverted to 
the engine room . At 2247 the main engine electronic  fault log indicated an injection 
quantity piston failure on number two cylinder.  
2.7 At 2300 the  main engine control was transferred  to the bridge  so tha t the OOW could 
test the main engine both  ahead and astern . The OOW  informed the master of a fault 
with the main  engine , and the master in turn spoke to the chief engineer on the 
telephone . Details of the fault  were not discussed , but the master did ask if it would be 
repaired  in time for departure  and was reassured by the chief engineer that it would . 
2.8 At about 2304 the engine was tested from the bridge , but the fault with the quantity 
piston was still present.  At that time  the engineers  believed  the problem to be the 
sensor on the injection quantity piston . At about 2330  the sensor was replaced,  and the 
piston rod was  lubricated.  
2.9 The chief engineer telephone d the OOW  on the bridge  and advised that  there was a 
problem with the main engine . The chief engineer asked when the harbour pilot was 
due to arrive on board for departure and was told midnight.   
2.10 At about 2345 the chief engineer telephone d the master on the bridge.  During the 
conversation the chief engineer told the master to press the 'cancel slowdown button ' 
situated on  the main engine control panel , which the master did . The cancel slowdown 
button  cancelled the automatic engine slowdown. The master did not ask the chief

 engineer why it was necessary to  press  the cancel slowdown  button . This point is 
discussed further in section 3 . 
2.11 At about 2359 the engine er on watch telephone d the bridge and asked for the main 
engine to be placed in  bridge control . 
2.12 At about midnight t he pilot arrived on the bridge and the master -pilot exchange of 
information took place. During th e exchange  the master confirmed to the pilot  that 
there had been no immobilisation o f the main engine  and that  the engi ne was free of 
any defect s. They also discussed the passage plan for depart ure. 
2.13 Forecast e nvironmental  conditions at the time of departure w ere: 
• northerly wind 35  knots 2F3 gusting 45  knots  and then easing  
• tidal stream  at the entrance to  the port 2.5 knots ebb 3F4. 
2.14 Tugs were  secured  at about 0006 , and all mooring lines were let go and clear at about 
0018.  
2.15 As shown in Figure 3, the first main engine movement was at 0018, and the quantity 
piston failure alarm for number two cylinder  was triggered  immediately . 
2.16 Over the next three  minutes t he pilot ordered dead slow ahead, slow ahead and half 
ahead .  
2.17 At 0024 the tugs were let go , and at 0027 the pilot ordered full ahead  and the 
telegraph5 was set to full ahead (68  rpm [revolutions per minute] ). The chief engineer 
noted  that the main engine  speed was not increas ing above 48  rpm (this point is 
discussed further in section 3). The vessel's speed through the water was about 4.3 
knots .  
2.18 At 0028 an exhaust gas deviation alarm activated in the engine room because the 
number two cylinder  was not firing.  
2.19 At about 003 3 the pilot asked the master why the vessel 's speed  was so slow , and 
requested more  speed . In the next few minutes,  the pilot repeatedly  told the master 
the vessel was not going fast enough and asked if there was a problem. When the pilot 
first questioned the vessel's speed t he master called the chief engineer in the engine 
room  and told the chief engineer that  they needed more speed . During  the 
conversation the master asked the chief engineer if they could  cancel the scavenge 
limiter 4F6, to which the chief engineer  agreed.   
2.20 By 0043  the Funing 's speed through the water was about 0 knots, and its speed over 
the ground was about the same as the ebbing tidal stream  of 3.5 knots. The vessel was 
effectively drifting in the tidal stream  and starting to move out of the channel near 'B' 
buoy  (Figure 3). At about 004 4 the pilot r ecalled th e harbour tug Tai Pari  to assist , and 
the starboard anchor was let go .  
 
3 One knot is equal to 1.852 kilomet re per hour.  
4 Ebb tide is an outgoing  tide. 
5 A telegraph is a communications device used by a bridge team to give main -engine orders to a vessel's main 
engine .  
6 'Scavenging ' is the removal of exhaust gases from an engine cylinder by blowing in fresh air. A scavenge limiter 
monitors the scavenge air pressure and prevents the admission of fuel  into the engine . Cancelling the scavenge 
limiter effectively reduces the fuel/air ratio efficiency of the engine, but increases engine torque output .

 2.21 Shortly after wards the Funing  drifted over the top of the channel marker  'B' buoy , and 
the buoy's  mooring chain became entangled in  the Funing' s rudder and propeller.  
2.22 At about 0048 the main engine  automatically shut down on overload.  
2.23 By about 0054 the Funing  was anchored  outside the main channel  with its stern 
pointing towards shallow water.   
2.24 By about 0054 the tug Tai Pari  had arrived on scene and  made fast with a line to the 
Funing' s starboard quarter 5F7. The tug attempted to pull the stern into the main channel , 
but due to the force of the wind and tide it was unsuccessful, and the tow line parted . 
2.25 A second tug, the Sir Robert , had also made its way to the area . Both tugs remained on 
station nearby.  
2.26 At about 0115 the engineer s began to replace the injection control unit  (ICU)  on 
number two cylinder with a new unit. By 0220 the new unit was in place and tested . No 
alarms or faults result ed. 
2.27 The port anchor was let go  and the vessel lay to two anchors. As the tide turned  the 
vessel  pivoted around the anchors and lay aligned with the channel , with the bow 
pointing  north -north east.  
2.28 The Funing 's port quarter lay very close to 'C' buoy, so the tug Sir Robert  was used to 
try to drag the stern into deeper water. Due to the environmental conditions the line 
parted . The pilot made the decision for the vessel  to remain in position , lying to both 
anch ors, and wait  for the tide to turn.  
2.29 At about 0 800, once the tide had begun to ebb, both tugs re-secured and towed the 
Funing  outside the harbour limits and re-anchored  it. 
2.30 On 14 July 2020 the Funing  was towed back into Port of Tauranga for repairs . The hull 
was surveyed,  and d amage was found to the rudder stock and the tip of one propeller 
blade .  
2.31 On 6 September  2020  the Funing  was taken under tow to Singapore by an ocean -
going tug  for repair.

 Introduction to the Funing 's propulsion system  
2.32 The Funing 's main engine was  a slow-speed , five-cylinder , two-stroke  diesel, Wärtsilä  
RT-Flex model , connected to a fixed -pitch 6F8 propeller.  
2.33 The propulsion system did not include a gearbo x, so the main engine rpm correlated 
to vessel speed through the water. The relationship between main engine rpm and 
design vessel speed is given in the Thome Ship Management pilot card (Appendix 1) , 
and that excerpt is shown in Figure 4. Note the Funing  was laden  during its depart ure 
from Port of Tauranga .

2.34 The Funing's main engine  was controlled by a Wärtsilä  engine control system (WECS) 
(Figure 5), which in turn controlled an electronic Flex Control Module ( FCM-20) for 
each cylinder . The FCM-20 controlled electro -hydraulic valves for each ICU  and is 
discussed in more detail later in the report.   
2.35 The function of the ICU was to supply a predetermined quantity of fuel to the engine 
cylinder fuel injectors. The quantity  of fuel varied depend ed on the load on the engine, 
and was apportioned by a fuel injection quantity piston within the ICU. The quantity of 
fuel was measured by a sensor attached to the fuel injection quantity piston.  
 
8 When the pitch of a propeller is set at the factory where it is made, and cannot be adjusted w hile in use, the 
propeller is known as a fixed -pitch prope ller.

2.36 The ICU was a  key component of the RT-Flex engine. Figure 5 shows a photo graph  of 
the ICU removed from the Funing  after the accident , and Figure 6 shows a labelled 
image .  
2.37 The working  principle of RT-Flex engines was that fuel injection timing was controlled 
by a computer  via electro -hydraulic valves, rather than mechanical camshaft s.  
2.38 The WECS control led the functions of the main engine . For each combustion cycle of 
each cylinder , the WECS sen t an 'injection command ' to the FCM -20, which was relayed 
to the electro -hydraulic  rail valve s on the ICU  (Figure 7).  
2.39 When the rail valve was actuate d it open ed the servo oil supply to a hydraulic piston  
within the rail valve , which in turn  cause d the injection control valve  to open . 
2.40 Once the injection control valve had opened , the quantity piston started to move and 
fuel flowed to the fuel injector  valve s.  
2.41 Injection would continue until the WECS sent , via the FCM -20, a 'return command ' to 
the electro -hydraulic rail valve , which would close that valve .  
2.42 When the rail valve closed the fuel injection control v alve would close, ending the fuel 
supply to the fuel injector  valves . 
2.43 The quantity piston would then slowly return to its initial position , ready for the next 
injection cycle.

technical bulletin)  
Maintenance on the main engine ICU 
2.44 Wärtsilä  stated in its ICU maintenance  guidance documentation : "The life expectancy 
of ICU components depends upon operational conditions ." In the case of ICU 
malfunction, the options for onboard problem -solving were  normally limited to 
replacement of the rail valves, the fuel quantity sensor  and the fuel  injection  quantity 
piston. If further measures were  required, th e complete ICU, including rail valves and 
fuel quantity sensor/piston, should be sent for repair or renewal.  
2.45 Wärtsilä  technical bulletins advise d that the onboard maintenance of ICUs was limited 
to trouble shooting and "simple rectifying actions". They stated that ICUs should be 
returned to a Wärtsilä  service centre for remanufacture  after they had reached their 
life-time service hours , which Wärtsilä  estimate d at 36,000 hours of service.  The data 
and specification for o verhaul s of engine components are shown in Appendix  3. They  
recommend  the ICU  lifetime service hours, checking a filter and checking the engine 
monitoring software for incorrect rail va lve timing. Incorrect rail valve timing could 
indicate excessive leakag e. 
2.46 The defective ICU removed from the Funing  had accumulated 24,586.6 hours of service.  
2.47 One of the onboard maintenance tasks was to monitor  any 'leakage ' within the ICU.  
Leakage is a normal operating feature of an ICU.  
2.48 When mechanical components, such as a  hydraulic  piston or cylinder liner, slide 
against each other they are subject to wear. As the two components wear , the 
clearance between them  increases. At some stage the clearance will be large enough 
for oil to leak between the comp onents. Fuel quality can have a significant effect on 
engine wear, and can vary depending on where it is sourced .  
2.49 The viscosity of the fuel oil can also lead to leakage. Low-viscosity  fuel can leak 
between components where high viscosity fuel would not.  

 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 10 >>
 2.50 The leakage can result in  fuel oil being present where it should  not be. In the case of 
fuel leakage in an ICU , where the temperature is high enough , a coking 7F9 process may 
occur and create coking deposits within the ICU.  
2.51 Recent maintenance of the ICUs had included measuring leakage each month . The 
most recent testing had been  conducted on 11  May 2020 , approximate two months 
before the accident. The test result  had not indicate d an issue with leakage.  Records 
show ed no test was conducted in June , hence it was one month overdue . 
2.52 Leaked oil can drain from the ICU and is collected in a drain tank ; the drain tank is 
monitored daily. Changes in the rate of oil leakage to the drainage tank may indicate a 
problem with an ICU. 
Low-sulphur  fuel 
2.53 As part of reducing harmful emissions from shipping , the International Maritime  
Organization (I MO) had introduced a limit on sulphur in marine fuels ; this had come 
into force in January 2020. Compliant fuel was referred to as 'low-sulphu r fuel '. The 
Funing  was using low-sulphur fuel.  
2.54 Wärtsilä  had provided guidance on "operating 2 -stroke engines in compliance with the 
global sulphur cap 2020" as a business white paper in 2019.  
2.55 The paper had advised that : "continuous operation of the engine using high sulphur 
HFO (heavy fuel oil)  would result in the  standard lifetime service hours being achieved. 
When switching to clean low-sulphur  fuels with low viscosity the efficiency or function 
of the engine 's fuel injection components might be affected ". 
2.56 Wärtsilä  also noted in its technical journal , In Detail  (issue  02 2019 ), that leakage and 
the premature wear and tear of components were  the biggest concerns when 
switching to low-sulphur fuel .  
2.57 Wärtsilä  provided a technical bulletin , RT-229, titled Operation Guidance to the Sulphur 
Cap 2020 , which targeted all owners and operators of Wärtsilä  two-stroke engines.  
2.58 Section 3.1 of RT -229 discuss ed the implications of low-sulphur fuels for ICUs. The 
implications were  outlined under two categories: small and medium bore engines , and 
big bore engin es.  
2.59 With respect to small and medium bore engines , such as that fitted to the Funing , RT-
229 stated , "Leakage rates from individual ICUs should be measured together with fuel 
viscosity information to record a trend of the leakage development. As general 
guidance, leakage rates … on respective ICUs during [ low-sulphur  fuel] use are an 
indication for worn ICUs ." 
Thome Ship  Management  safety management system  
2.60 The IMO's International Safety Management Code  requires vessels to maintain a safety 
management system that:  
 
9 A process where oil heated to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen release s all the volatile components. 
A hard and strong high -carbon material named coke is left behind.

 • is managed and enforced by the master  
• ensures the maintenance of the ship in safe condition  
• ensures compliance with the relevant rules and regulations . 
2.61 The Funing  was managed by Thome Ship Management  Pte. Ltd. (Thome Ship 
Management ). The vessel's safety management system was contained withi n a safety 
management system manual . In respect of this accident  the relevant sections of the 
Funing 's safety management system  manual  are outlined below . 
The engine room   
2.62 The OOW  provided the engineers with two hours' notice  for preparing and testing the  
main engine and auxiliary systems in accordance with the ir safety management system  
checklist . Under normal circumstances , two hours provided  adequate time to work 
through the checklist and test the main engine ahead and astern from both the engine 
room and the bridge.   
The bridge   
2.63 The bridge team were required to complete , and sign, a hard-copy checklist that 
covered bridge preparation for sea . One of the check list items (shown in Figure 9) was 
to confirm  with the engine ers that the main engine  had been tested both ahead and 
astern . When t he checklist  was completed it was  counter signed b y the master . On the 
day of the accident the checkbox confirming  that the main engine had been tested was 
ticked .  
 
 
Figure 8: Bridge preparation for sea checklist  
 
2.64 The bridge manoeuvring logbook and bell book10 was a single logbook that was used 
to record  vital information about the vessel's movements . As shown in Figure 10, the 
manoeuvring logbook and bell book recorded that the main engine had been tested 
ahead and astern at 2240. The bridge logbook recorded the same.  
 
 
10 A manoeuvring logbook and bell book is a document that records information significant to a vessel 's 
movements  and the main engine .

2.65 When a pilot boards a vessel,  a formal  meeting takes place between the master and 
the pilot, known as the master -pilot exchange  of information  (Appendix 1) . The 
purpose of the meeting is to ensure  that the pilot and the bridge team have , among 
other things , a shared mental model of the intended passage plan , the vessel  
manoeuvring  characteristics and any operational defects .  
2.66 The Funing 's safety management system  manual  included a section regarding the 
master -pilot exchange  (shown in Figure  11) that, in part, required the master to discuss 
"unusual characteristics, or malfunctioning equipment" . 
 
 
Figure 10: Extract from Th ome Ship Management safety management system manual  
2.67 A pilot card (Appendix 1) was completed by the master to provide  the pilot with  critical 
information in an easily accessible format upon their boarding  the ship.  It included 
whether the main engine had been tested ahead and astern  (excerpt shown in Figure 
12). Although t he checkbox had been circled ambiguously , it was likely that it showed  
the main engine had been tested as  already  noted in the bridge logbook , manoeuv ring 
logbook and bell book.   
2.68 The pilot stated at interview that they had not been made  aware of any defects or 
issue s with the main engine  prior to sailing.

Roles of the master and chief engineer  
2.69 The Funing 's safety management system manual included sections defin ing the 
responsibilities of each of the vessel 's crew.  
2.70 The master of the Funing  was responsible for, in part:  
• the safety of life, ship and cargo  
• ascertaining seaworthiness of the vessel in all respect s (stores, navigation  
equipment , machinery etc) prior to sailing . 
2.71 The chief engineer of the Funing  was responsible for, in part :  
• the maintenance and operation of all machinery on  board  
• the safe running, management and maintenance of all engine and machinery  
related items  
• keeping the master informed of all matters related to the vessel's machinery and 
electrical installations . 
Standards of training, certification and watchkeeping  
2.72 The IMO adopted the  International Convention on  Standards of Training, Certification 
and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ( the STCW Convention ) in 1978, and the most recent 
major revision came into force in 2010.  In 199 5 the Seafarers ' Train ing, Certification 
and Watchkeeping Code  (STCW Code ) was adopted and  gave  effect to the STCW 
Convention .  
2.73 Part A of the STCW Code - Mandatory Standards , Chapter II (Standards regarding the 
master and deck department ) and Chapter  III (Standards regarding the engine 
department ), required that officers in charge of a watch  "demonstrate the competence 
to undertake, at the operational level, the tasks, duties and responsibi lities listed ", 
which included:  
• maintain a safe watch using the principles and methods of BRM ( bridge resource 
management ) or ERM (engine room resource management) . 
2.74 One principle of BRM  and ERM  was 'effective communication '. The criteria for effective 
comm unication were  listed as:  
• communication is clearly and unambiguously given and received  
For example , when the control of the main engine is transferred to the bridge prior to 
departure, the chief engineer must clearly state whether the main engine is ready  for 
manoeuvring, or describe any issues that might limit the ability to manoeuvre the 
vessel  safely  
 

 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 14 >>
 • questionable decisions and/or actions result in appropriate challenge and 
response  
For example , if a master were  made aware of a potential issue with the main engine 
prior to departure, and the chief engineer requested the master to  activate a button 
that cancel led the main engine's automatic slowdown, the master should challenge 
that request.  
 Funing crew  
2.75 The master held a master mariner certificate o f competency  issued in 2008 . The 
accident voyage was part of  their second tour of duty as master on  board the Funing .  
2.76 The chief engineer had been  promoted to the position of chief engineer in 2011 . This 
tour of duty was the first time they had sailed on  board the Funing .  
2.77 At the time of the accident the master and the chief  engineer  had been on  board the 
Funing  for about 10 months  and six months respectively.   
Port of Tauranga  
2.78 Port of Tauranga provides a pilotage service to vessels over 250  gross registered ton s 
unless the master holds a pilot exemption certificate ; the Funing  was over 250  gross 
registered tons  and required a pilot . 
2.79 The Port of Tauranga safety management system manual provided pilots with standard 
operating procedures  to support their operations and ensure safe pilotage . The safety 
management system included  the environmental conditions suitable for conducting 
pilotage  operations . 
2.80 The standard operating procedures prescribed a n upper  wind limit for pilotage based 
on the type of vessel involved  (Figure 13). The prescribed upper wind limit for the 
Funing , a fully laden , deep -draught bulk carrier , was 40  knots.  
2.81 Further, the w ind limit could be extended or restricted by the pilot, in which case the 
master sh ould be fully informed  on and agree  to the intended movement.  
2.82 Pilots were also to consider the impact s of sea and swell  conditions  on vessels ' speed s. 
 
 
Figure 12: Wind limits for Port of Tauranga  
 
2.83 The t idal stream can significant ly affect  the manoeuvring characteristics of large 
vessels . The sta ndard operating procedures prescribed upper limits for the rate of tidal 
stream by  using the  vessel 's length and dra ught as key factors .  

 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 15 >>
 2.84 The length of  the Funing  was greater  than 160  metres  and it had a dra ught greater 
than 9.5  metres  and less than 12.5  metres. The corresponding prescribed  upper limit 
for the rate of tide was less than or equal to 2.5  knots  (see Figure 14). 
 
 
Figure 13: Port of Tauranga tidal window grades  
2.85 The Port of Tauranga provided a comprehensive passage plan for the port. Included as 
part of the plan  were:  
• a check of whether there were any deficiencies that might  influence  the passage 
plan 
• a check of whether any main engine maintenance had been  carried out while in 
the Port of Tauranga  
• the environmental conditions expected for the pilotage passage . 
2.86 Appendix 2 shows the Port of Tauranga passage plan  completed for the departure of 
the Funing  on the day of the accident . The pilot was expect ing a wind of 35  knots 
gusting to 40  knots , and an ebb tide of 2.5 knots.  
Testing the ICU  
2.87 During pre -departure checks of the main engine, a fault  was identified on  the injection 
quantity piston for number two engine cylinder , which had failed. It is very likely that 
the injection control valve was unable to move because it had become seized wit h 
coking debris that had entered the system and interfered with the operation of the 
valves.  
2.88 The same failure occurred  again  while the vessel was  departing Tauranga . 
2.89 After the accident, when the vessel was laying at anchor , engineers  replaced the ICU 
with a new unit. Replacing  the ICU resolved the fault.   
2.90 The malfunctioning ICU was secured  by the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission  (Commission), which  then subjected  it to forensic examination to 
determine the cause of failure.  
2.91 The Commission engage d two independent experts to conduct  the forensic 
examination s of the ICU : Quest Integrity Ltd , which  had expertise in metallurgy and 

 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 16 >>
 forensic examination ; and Det Norske Veritas , which  had expertise in the Wärtsilä  RT-
Flex engine.  
2.92 The examination of the I CU was conducted at the Quest Integrity laboratory in 
Wellington, New Zealand. The draft report and its findings were discussed with a 
technical representative from Wärtsilä .  
2.93 The e xamination found that in the ICU the rail valves11 were operational , and one of the 
two injection control valves had seized , very likely due to coking debris entering the 
system . Figure 15 shows the coking debris found in the cavity on the fuel oil side of the 
servo piston12.

 3 Analysis  
Introduction  
3.1 The Funing  was a bulk carrier that could not generate enough propulsive power to 
overcome the prev ailing  adverse environmental conditions  while  under pilotage . As a 
result,  the vessel lost control , deviated from the channel and became entangled in a 
channel marker buoy.   
3.2 It is virtually certain that t he Funing 's main engine was unable to gen erate full power  
because a  fuel ICU for number two engin e cylinder was malfunctioning , and th e 
cylinder was not firing.   
3.3 The environmental conditions were at the upper end of the allowable limits , which  
meant optimal  engine power was required for the vessel to navigate the channel safely.   
3.4 Three safety issue s were  identified : 
• ineffective communication between the master and chief engineer meant the 
master was not fully aware of the malfunctioning main engine prior to the vessel 
departing its berth   
• the vessel's main engine malfunction , combined with the prevailing 
environmental conditions , exceeded the safety considerations in the pilotage 
plan, and the vessel 's navigational control was rendered ineffective  
• the introduction of low-sulphur fuel has had a significant effect on the 
perform ance of marine diesel engines. Although Wärtsilä  had provided , in 
various documents , guidance on the effects of using low-sulphur fuels in its ICUs, 
this had not been fully integrated into the vessel 's safety management and 
planned maintenance systems .  
Vessel depart ed the  berth with a malfunctioning  main engine  
Safety issue:  Ineffective  communication between the master and chief engineer meant the 
master was not fully aware of the malfunctioning main engine prior to the vessel departing its 
berth.  
3.5 The chief engineer 's role on  board the Funing  included responsibility for the 
"maintenance  and operation of all machinery on  board" . In practice  the chief engineer  
was responsible for manag ing all aspects of the engine room , and in particular 
ensur ing that the main engine  was fully operational  before handing over  control to the 
bridge .  
3.6 The bridge team had notified  the engine  room  approximately two hours before the 
intended  departure  time, which was sufficient for them to complete all their pre -
departure preparations and testing.  
3.7 About 28 minutes  after commencing their preparations , the engineers  tested the main 
engine ahead and astern and became aware of a malfunction with the ICU on the 
number two cylinder .  
3.8 They followed  the trouble -shooting guidance provided by the engine manufacturer  
and attempted to rectify the problem  four times . Each time the ICU on number two 
cylinder failed.  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 18 >>
 3.9 The fourth  test failed at 234 2, which was  18 minutes before the planned departure. The 
engine room team had tried to rectify the fault using the information they had 
available to them on  board the vessel . Although t he chief engineer had already tried 
reboot ing the number two cylinder control module and resetting  the alarms , it was 
decided to try one more time.   
3.10 However, the engine  was not tested  again to confirm that it was functioning properly . 
The most  recent test had show n that the main engine was malfunctioning.   
3.11 Given the safety management system  requirement for the chief e ngineer to keep "the 
master informed of all matters related to the vessel's machinery " 8F13, this was probably 
the last opportunity before departure to discuss the issue with the master.  
3.12 A few minutes later , at 2345 , the chief engineer called the master on the bridge . During 
what was a brief conversation , the chief enginee r told the master to cancel the 
automatic slowdown , but did not explain the reason for or the implication s of doing so , 
specifically a likely redu ction in propulsive power . 
3.13 The automatic slowdown feature of the main engine was designed to protect it from 
damage if it malfunctioned . If there were  a risk of the main engine malfunctioning 
during a safety -critical passage or manoeuvre , the feature could be  cancelled .  
3.14 It was rare to cancel the automatic slowdown, and the master had never used th e 
feature previously.  The request to cancel  it was an indication that the chief engineer 
believed the main engine might malfunction . That the master had never used the 
function before was an opportunity to question the chief engineer 's request . By 
ascertain ing the reason  for cancelling the automatic slowdown the master may  have  
discover ed that the main engine was malfunctioning and the potential effect s on the 
vessel 's manoeuvrability.   
3.15 However , the master complied with the chief engineer's  instruction to cancel the 
automatic slowdown without discussing the reason or the implications .  
3.16 As a result,  the bridge team were unaware of the defect with the main engine and its 
implications , and consequently were  unable to  brief the pilot accordingly . 
3.17 The Commission identified two likely reasons for the bridge team being  unaware of the 
main engine malfunction:  
• the OOW  observed the main engine turning ahead and astern during the pre -
departure test  
• the main engine defect and its implication s were  not clearly communicated 
between the engine room and bridge teams.  
Crew resource management  
3.18 The key principle  of BRM and ERM is that they use all available resources, including 
people, procedures and equipment, to provide safeguards against accidents created by  
human performance.  The master and chief engineer had both been trained in BRM and 
ERM respectively.  
3.19 Although the  bridge team demonst rated an effective use of closed -loop 
communication with respect to helm and engine orders during pilotage , there was a 
lack of departmental  communication between the engine room and the bridge  - 
 
13 Funing's safety management system manual  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 19 >>
 specifically that the master and chief engineer did not main tain a clear and 
unambiguous  line of  communication.  The requirements and benefits of good 
departmental communication had not been addressed in the safety management 
system . 
3.20 Had the master been made aware of the engine defect and its implications , the pilot 
could have been briefed accordingly . As a result b oth master and pilot would  have 
been better able to make informed decisions on whether it was safe to depart a s 
planned. The reality was that the master , unaware of the defect, belie ved his vessel 
would perform as designed in what were marginal  environmental  conditions.   
3.21 The Commission would have recommended to Thome Ship Management that it review 
the safety management system used on  board the Funing  to ensure that it 
incorporate d the requirement for crews to communicate safety -critical information .  
3.22 However, as a result of the accident Thome  Ship Management has already 
implemented changes to the safety management system  to ensure that the master and 
chief engineer main tained full and clear communication . As a result,  no 
recommendation had been made .  
Vessel embarked on a pilotage passage in marginal environmental  
conditions  
Safety issue : The vessel's main engine malfunction , combined with the prevailing environmental 
conditions , exceeded the safety considerations  in the pilot age plan , and the vessel 's 
navigational control  was rendered ineffective.  
3.23 The m anoeuvring characteristics of a vessel , and hence the control of the vessel  are, in 
part, dependent on the rate of water flow past the rudder.   
3.24 The speed  of the vessel is dependent on the main engine producing enough power to 
overcome the drag 9F14 of the vessel . The drag of a vessel is a combination of the 
characteristics of the hull in the water and the environmental conditions acting on the 
entire vessel , for example wind acting on the superstructure . An increase in wind speed 
and wave action will increase the drag of a vessel.   
3.25 The main engine was connected directly to the propell er, which in turn produ ced the 
water flow past the rudder. The relatively low  power output produced by the main 
engine meant the propeller shaft revolutions could only increase as the vessel 
accelerated  through the water . When  the environmental conditions were  adverse , it 
would take longer for the vessel to accelerate , and therefore the manoeuvring 
characteristics during this period would be reduced.  
3.26 Figure 16 shows the main engine rpm and vessel sp eed as the Funing  departed Port of 
Tauranga. The X -axis shows the time. The left-hand Y -axis shows  the engine rpm  
commanded by the telegraph, and the engine rpm as measured on the engine itself. 
The right -hand Y -axis shows the Funing 's speed through the water.  
3.27 It can be seen in Figure 16 that the telegraph showed the sequentia l bridge team 
commands from dead slow ahead to full ahead , but the actual rpm never consistently 
reached half ahead (48 rpm).   
 
14 A mechanical force that results from the interaction of a solid body with a fluid. Drag acts in opposition to the 
direction of the propelling force.  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 20 >>
 3.28 Due to the reduced power of the malfunctioning main engine , the increased drag due 
to vessel speed and the adverse environmental conditions , the Funing  did not 
consistently  reach half ahead rpm when commanded by the telegraph.  
3.29 When the Funing  rounded Tanea beacon it was more exposed to the head sea and 
wind.  The combination of reduced main engine power and adverse envi ronmental 
conditions further reduce d the vessel 's rate of acceleration and its ability to increase 
speed.  As a result,  its manoeuvring characteristics  were significantly diminished and 
ultimately overcome  by the increasing environmental effect , and the vessel's speed 
through the water was reduced to near zero  knots .

Port of Tauranga safe operating procedures  
3.30 Port of Tauranga 's safe operating procedures (SOP s) included both preventive risk 
mitigation and recovery risk mitigation with respect to the pilotage service it offered.  
3.31 Preventive risk mitigation for safe pilotage included , but was not limited to , identifying 
risks to navigation and the vessel size - and type-specific upper limits for environmental 
conditions such as wind, tidal currents, wave and swell.  
3.32 Recovery risk mitigation included,  but was not limited to , the use of tugs for vessels ' 
loss of power, and taking account of environmental condit ions. 
Port pilotage passage plan environmental conditions  
3.33 The environmental conditions at the time of the Funing 's departure , and described  in 
the pilotage passage plan , were at the upper end of the allowable environmental limits  
described in Port of Tauranga's saf ety management plan .  
3.34 Had the Funing 's main engine been able to produce full power , it is very likely the 
vessel would have completed the outbound pilotage without issue.   
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 21 >>
 3.35 In this case the unexpected lack of propulsive power due to the main engine 
malfunction  had not been relayed to the pilot prior to departure .  
3.36 Although the risk mitigations in place did not seem unreasonable, t he Commission 
would have made a recommendation  to Port of Tauranga that it  assess the allowable 
weather windows for pilotage and the ability of its tugs to mitigate the risk of a vessel 
losing power while under pilotage. However, it has  already instituted changes to its 
SOPs that address both issues.  
3.37 The changes are:  
• a reduction in upper wind limits for all vessels , from 40 knots to 30 knots  
• a new SOP that mitigates  the risk of high swell in the port's  outer channels  
• the provision of vessel -type risk profiles  regarding propulsion failure and  the 
requi rement for regular tug escorts for outgoing vessels.  
Injection control unit malfunction  
Safety issue : The introduction of low-sulphur  fuel has had a significant effect on the 
performance of marine diesel engines. Although Wärtsilä  had provided guidance , in various 
documents , on the effect s of using low-sulphur  fuels in its ICUs, this  has not always been  fully 
understood  by end-users.  
3.38 The vessel was unable to increase speed because the power produced by the main 
engine was unable to overcome the  vessel's drag induced by environmental 
conditions.  
3.39 The primary reason for the vessel being unable to develop  sufficient p ropulsive power 
was that number two  cylinder  of the main engine was not firing as a result of a 
malfunction of number two cylinder's  injection control unit.  It is possible that other 
factors , such as hull fouling , propeller fouling15 and changes in the normal operating 
conditions of the vessel , further contributed to the main engine 's inability to generate 
sufficient propulsi ve power to manoeuvre the vessel  safely .  
3.40 The malfunction of the ICU occurred prior to the vessel leaving the safety of its berth .  
3.41 Number two  cylinder was malfunctioning because an injection control valve within the 
ICU was unable  to move . This meant that the quantity piston was also unable to move  
properly , resulting in  fuel not being p roperly injected into the cylinder, and the cylinder 
not firing.  
3.42 It is very likely that the injection control valve was unable to move because it had 
become seized with coking debris that had entered the system and interfered with the 
operation of the valves .  
3.43 As discussed in section s 2 and 3  of this report , the coking deposits within the ICU 
occurred because of fuel leakage . The leakage was likely a result of two things  
associated with low-sulphur  fuels : 
• increased wear  of the ICU components  
• low-viscosity fuel . 
 
15 Hull/ Propeller fouling can cause an engine to reach its maximum continuous rating before it reach es full RPMs. 
This condition is called heavy running of the fixed pitch propeller.  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 22 >>
 3.44 There was evidence to indicate the engineers had been monitoring the condition of 
the ICU ; for example , they had conducted monthly leakage measurements of each ICU. 
The magnitude of the leakage for number two ICU was recorded as between 1.74 and 
2.07 litres per hour in a five-month period , as shown in Figure 17. These recorded 
leakage values can be considered minimal , representing values unlikely to lead to 
coking .  
[Main engine 
running hours][Very low sulphur fuel (litres)]
 
Figure 16: ICU leakage test results  
3.45 As general guidance , Wärtsilä  states that leakage rates of above 12 litres per hour 
while using low-sulphur  fuel are an indication that the ICU is worn . When the 
Commission inspected the ICU , coking debris was found , which indicated excessive 
leakage . However,  it is not clear why there was a disparity  between the daily and 
monthly leakage  measurements recorded on  board and the coking found in the  ICU.  
3.46 The ICU was a critical component of the vessel's  main engine , and its malfunction 
directly affected  the safety of the vessel. Wärtsilä  provided preventive risk-mitigation 
methods and recover y risk-mitigation methods.  Preventive risk mitigation was 
provided by preventive maintenance, and recovery risk mitigation was provided by  
malfunction alarms and troubleshooting guidance.  
3.47 The engineers  knew of the malfunction after being alerted by the va rious alarms and 
fault codes provided by the main engine monitoring system . They exhausted the ir 
understanding  of the  ICU troubleshooting guidance  but were still unable to  rectify the 
malfunction ing ICU . 
Preventive maintenance  
3.48 Planned maintenance program mes are intended to rectify defects before they arise. By 
design, the onboard planned maintenance program me for the ICU was limited to basic 
lubrication  and cleaning and monitoring certain performance metrics , in this case fuel  
leakage w ithin the ICU.   
3.49 Wärtsilä  required the ICU to be remanufactured at its service centre when the ICU had 
reached its lifetime  running hours. The inspection and overhaul specification provided 
by Wärtsilä  estimated the lifetime  of the ICU at 36,000 service hou rs.  
3.50 Because the ICU had been  designed to run effectively without significant onboard 
maintenance, the en gineers  relied on the estimated  lifetime  service hours and 
monitoring performance metrics to ensure the full function of the ICU.  
3.51 Although the ICU service lifetime  was estimated at 36,000  hours , the ICU on number 
two cylinder had accumulated less than 25,000 hours before it malfunctioned.  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 23 >>
 Low-sulphur  fuel 
3.52 The IMO had introduced a low-sulphur  fuel cap in Ja nuary 2020 for reasons of 
environmental protection. The change in fuel types and profile meant significant 
uncertainty for the maritime industry around the performance of ships ' engines.  
3.53 Wärtsilä  had provided various documents, information and optional upgrades to end -
users of its engines regarding the effect s of low-sulphur  fuel on Wärtsilä  engines.   
3.54 In Wärtsilä 's business white paper of 2019 it stated  that using high-sulphur fuels would 
result in engine components achieving estimated lifetime  service hour s, but that the 
efficiency or function of the engines ' fuel-injection components might be affected  by 
using low-sulphur  fuel. It also noted in its technical journal that , "Leakage and 
premature wear and tear on components are the biggest concerns when switching to 
low-sulphur  fuel."  
3.55 In this case the ICU malfunctioned far short of its estimated lifetime  service hours , and 
this was very likely due to coking  caused by oil leakag e.  
3.56 During a meeting with the engine manufacturer  and another meeting with ship 
managers  to discuss the ICU malfunction , the Commission noted that Wärtsilä  had 
produced a number of g uidance notes on the subject of ICU performance and 
maintenance . However , on the vessel  there was no single , comprehensive document 
available to the vessel's engineers to address the effect s of low-sulphur  fuel on ICU 
maintenance . The guidance that had been provided by Wärtsilä  to the vessel manager 
had not been fully in tegrated with the vessel 's safety management and planned 
maintenance systems.  
3.57 The switch to low-sulphur  fuels across the mari ne industry brought significant 
uncertainty on how the new fuels would affect  engine  performance, maintenance and 
longevity. Wärts ilä has provided guidance on monitoring  fuel leakage, analysing 
engine monitoring software, the potential effect s of using low-sulphur  fuels, and 
upgrading ICU parts. However , the information is located in various documents and is 
not always available to , or fully understood by , end-users.  See Appendix 3 for a list of 
those  documents . 
3.58 The Commission has made a recommend ation  to Wärtsilä  that it  take further steps to 
ensure that users of its RT-Flex engines can easily locate and assimilate all information 
regarding  the effect s of the IMO sulphur cap on ICU  performance, maintenance and 
lifetime  service .

 4 Findings  
4.1 The engineers identified a fault with the main engine during pre -departure testing, but 
they did not confirm it was rectified before departing port .  
4.2 The Funing 's main engine was unable to generate full power because a fuel injection 
control unit for the number two engi ne cylinder was malfunctioning, and the cylinder 
was not firing.  
4.3 A weakness in c ommunication between the master and chief engineer meant the 
bridge team were not fully aware of the problem with the main engine, or its 
implications.   
4.4 The problem with the m ain engine was not accounted for during the bridge team's 
pre-departure  checks , and  therefore they were unable to  relay  it to the pilot  during the 
master -pilot exchange of information . 
4.5 The environmental conditions on the day were at the upper end of the environmental 
limits imposed by Port of Tauranga's  safety management plan.  The limits were based 
on a vessel being fully manoeuvrab le, which was not the case on this occasion.  
4.6 The main en gine fault was very likely due to the injection control valve being unable to 
move because it had become seized with coking debris caused by the effect of low-
sulphur  fuel, which  interfered with the operation of the valves.  
4.7 There was no single , comprehens ive document available to the vessel's engineers to 
address the effect s of low-sulphur  fuel on injection control unit  maintenance .

 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis of factors that have 
contributed to the occurrence. They typically describe a system problem that has the 
potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide scale.  
5.2 Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may  issue a recommendation to address the issue . 
5.3 Recommendations are made to persons or organisations that are considered the most 
appropriate to address the identified safety issues.  
5.4 In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that safety actions a re taken, or any 
recommendations are implemented , without delay to help prevent similar accidents or 
incidents occurring in the future.  
Ineffective b ridge and engine room resource management  
5.5 Ineffective  communication between the master and chief engineer m eant the master 
was not fully aware of the malfunctioning main engine prior to the vessel departing its 
berth . 
5.6 Thome Ship Management  has introduced procedures to regulate communication 
between the master and chief engineer to ensure all safety -critical inf ormation is 
communicated  between them .  
The defined environmental conditions for departure  were marginal  
5.7 The vessel's main engine malfunction combined with the prevailing environmental 
conditions exceeded the safety considerations in the pilotage plan, and  the vessel 's 
navigational control was rendered ineffective . 
5.8 Port of Tauranga has made the following changes : 
Port of Tauranga has made changes to  its safety management system that ha ve resulted in 
changes to our existing Wind SOP (reduction of max wind) and the creation of a High 
Swell event SOP and resulted in regular Tug Escorting.  Additionally, we have committed to 
increased training for Pilots and Tug Masters with respect to emergency response as 
incorporating our findings into the future procur ement of tugs and tug equipment .  
Our analysis determines that the incident of an  [sic] vessel suffering  [main engine]  failure 
in the entrance whilst unescorted has reduced from 1/1000 to 1/7000 . 
The engine manufacturer 's maintenance  information was not fully 
understood by end -users   
5.9 The introduction of low-sulphur  fuel has had a significant effect on the performance of 
marine diesel engines. Although Wärtsilä  had provided guidance , in various 
documents,  on the effects of using low-sulphur  fuels in its ICUs, this had not been fully 
integrated into the vessel 's safety management and planned maintenance systems.  
5.10 Thome Ship Management has provided the Commission with a copy of its amended 
safety management s ystem  documentation , which  will ensure it capture s all the 
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 26 >>
 maintenance and safety publications received from equipment manufacturers and that 
any relevant information is integrated into its safety management system.

 6 Recommendation  
6.1 The Commission issues rec ommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to con tribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents.  
6.2 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future.  
6.3 The introduction of low-sulphur  fuel has had a significant effect on the performance of 
marine diesel engines. Although Wärtsilä  had provided guidance on the effects of 
using low-sulphur fuels in its ICUs, documentation on all possible effects has become 
separated over time and there was no single , comprehensive guidance document 
available to the vessel's engineers to address all the effect s of low-sulphur  fuel on ICU 
maintenance .  
6.4 The Commission has made a recommendation to Wärtsilä  that it  take further 
steps to help ensure users of its RT-Flex engines are fully aware of all the effect s 
of the IMO sulphur cap  and its operational effect s on ICU performance, 
maintenance and lifetime service . (010/21)

 7 Key lessons  
7.1 BRM  and ERM represent critical functionality and communication that are applied not 
only individually within th e two departments but also jointly between departments . 
They are  often referred to as maritime resource management.   
7.2 Equipment manufacturers ' instructions and  guidance documents can be safety critical . 
Those responsible for producing safety management system documents  should ensure 
that, after their publication , such d ocum ents and information  are made readily 
available  and as easy as practicable to assimilate into safety management systems by  
those responsible for the maintenance of such equipment .

Reconditioning 
of Injection 
Control Unit  In case of ICU malfunction, the options for on -board problem 
solving are normally limited to replacement of the Rail Valves, 
Fuel Quant ity Sensor and Fuel Quantity Piston. If further 
measures are required, the complete ICU, including Rail Valves 
and Fuel Quantity  
Sensor/Piston, should be sent for repair or reconditioning.  
 
After long -term operation the internal drain bores of the 
Injectio n Control Block may become clogged with carbon 
deposits. Due to pressure building up in these drain bores, this 
may ultimately result in external leakages. The ICU will then 
have to be sent for repair.

2.3 Fuel oil treatment  
3.0 Engine component design considerations  
 
Using fuel wit h low viscosity, an increased leakage in the fuel 
injection system will occur compared to HSFO operation. The 
leakage rate is increased inversely proportional to the viscosity, 
i.e. it can be five times higher with a reduction in fuel viscosity 
from  
15 to 3 CentiStokes (cSt).  
 
Furthermore, during an operation period of some years, there 
will be an increase in the clearance because of wear of 
components. Incorrect fuel treatment on board or insufficient 
quality of fuel can accelerate the wear rate. Small inc rease of 
clearance, however, will cause greater leakage flow compared 
to new components. The leakage flow is proportional to cubed 
clearance and could require earlier replacement of the 
components.  
Leakage flow = (clearance)3  
 
The internal leakage on fuel related equipment can be 
measured directly on the single parts. Alternately, the rail 
pressure drop trend in the flexView at engine stop gives an 
indication of the quantity of internal leakage. It is 
recommended to periodically check the rail pressure drop  at 
engine stop when running on VLSFO or after maintenance of 
fuel injection components.  
 
Note:  
It is therefore essential to maintain optimal condition of the 
different fuel injection components during VLSFO in use. An 
assessment of fuel system and injecti on components as well as 
engine performance evaluation by Wärtsilä Services is highly  
recommended.  
 
3.1 Engine component design  
ICU 
The implications of using low viscosity fuel in the ICU vary 
depending on engine and ICU type. On small bore ICUs starting 
difficulties were often reported due to worn ICV whereas big 
bore ICUs reported more exhaust gas temperature alarms 
caused by premature wear of the ICU valve seat.  
 
ICU small/medium bore (engine starting difficulties)  
 
Final Report MO -2020 -202 
<< Page 37 >>
 Leakage rates from individual  ICUs should be measured 
together with fuel viscosity information to record a trend of the 
leakage development. As general guidance, leakage rates of 
above 200 ml/min on respective ICUs during ULSFO in use are 
an indication for worn ICUs.

In order to ensure safe engine operation while continuously 
operating on low viscosity fuel, it is recommended to reduce 
the TBO of concerned ICUs by about 30%

"Who's afraid 
of the sulphur 
cap?"  "Combating leaks  
On the two -stroke low -speed engines' side,  
Nanda lists leakage  and premature wear  and tear on the 
components, as the biggest  
concerns involved in switching to low  sulphur fuel.  
"Low -viscosity fuel leads to a higher  
leakage rate in the injection equipment,  
which can result in engine starting  
difficulties or slowdo wn due to insufficient  
pressure in the fuel injection system.  
Furthermore, the high leakage rate needs to  
be handled by the drain fuel system." " 
The paper outlines the risks and issues associated with low 
sulphur fuels, also recommends and outlines various solutions 
and upgrades to ensure operation on low sulphur fuels.  
 
 
 
 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ng āti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai mārama' (i te ara 
haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pur suit of understanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwe lling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe' or 'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent s the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā hau e wh ā - the four winds  
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircra ft that move through Aotearoa's 'long 
white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a  'Aviation '.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The s ections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for ' Maritime .  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the s ea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
