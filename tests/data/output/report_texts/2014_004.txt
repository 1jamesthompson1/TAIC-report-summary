The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future .  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency .  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domesti cally and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents .

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 5 August 2014 an a eroplane  on a sightseeing flight charter around the  lower South Island 
crashed  near the Poolburn R eservoir, killing the pilot and seriously injuring the two 
passengers.  
1.2. The a eroplane  aerodynamic ally stalled while being manoeuvred at low level in the vicinity of 
an airstrip located on remote farmland .  The stall occurred at a height that was insufficient to 
enable recovery  before  the aircraft struck  the ground.  
1.3. The pilot was carrying out a stock -clearing mano euvre to move cattle that were on the airstrip, 
and was in the process of turning the a eroplane  around at low level to perform a second pass 
over the airst rip to scare the livestock away  before landing , when the accident occurred.  
1.4. The following factors wer e found to have contributed to the accident:  
 a northwesterl y wind  directly across the airstrip  made low -level flying difficult, and 
required more space  than normal for the pilot to turn the a eroplane  around  
 the pilot 's decision to turn downwind at low leve l, and towards higher ground without 
climbing, red uced terrain clearance and safety margins    
 the pilot 's decision to continue the turn despite low terrain ahead, and to increase the  
angle  of bank  at a low  airspeed, led to the aerodynamic stall . 
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  made the following findings : 
 pilot incapacitation was very unlikely to have been a contribut ing factor  
 a mechani cal or engine failure was very  unlikely to have been a contribut ing factor  
 the a eroplane  stalled in a turn  performed at low level  during a stock -clearing mano euvre 
 the operator  believed that stock clearing was permitted, but  had no  written guidelines  
and had not given its pilots flight training in the mano euvre 
 there was a lack of clarity on whether stock clearing  was a permitted activity under the 
Civil Aviation Rules . 
1.6. The Commission made the following recommendation  to the Director of Civil Aviation:  
 he provide a clear statement to relevant sectors of the aviation industry on whether stock  
clearing is a permitted activity.  If the Director decides it is a permitted activity under a 
particular Civil Aviation R ule part, he should provide clear guidance on the conduct of the 
activity.  
1.7. The key lesson s identified from the inquiry into this occurr ence are : 
 flying  at close proximity to the ground requires a high degree of accuracy as there is little 
margin for error.  It is important that pilots are fully aware of the stall characteristics of 
their aircraft, in particular how they are  affected by ma noeuvres such as steep turns. 
Pilots should also be aware of the effect s of wind on the  amount of  ground covered 
during a turn  
 operators must issue clear guidelines and procedures for their pilots to follow, and ensure 
that they are being complied with.  P ilots should  be required to  regularly demonstrate 
proficiency in carrying out the types of manoeuvres and operations they perform for the 
operator.

 Final report AO -2014 -004 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 5 August 2014 the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was 
notified of the accident by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA), and opened an 
inquiry under section 13 of the T ransport Accident Investigation Commission A ct 1990 . 
2.2. The next day  two investigators from the Commission travelled to the accident site  to 
commence the site investigation.  
2.3. On 7 August  2014 the Chief Executive Officer and Operations Manager of Glenorchy Air were 
interviewed at Queenstown Airport .   
2.4. On 8 August  2014  the a eroplane 's fuel control unit was  inspected at an engine overhaul 
facility , under the supervision of the investigator in charge.  
2.5. On 9 August  2014  the two passengers were interviewed by the Commission 's investigators at 
Dunedin Hospital.  
2.6. On 11 August  2014  the a eroplane  wreckage was transported to the Commission 's storage 
facility in Wellington, where a further detailed inspection was carried out.  
2.7. On 15 August 2014 the a eroplane 's engine was inspected at an engine overhaul facility , 
under the supervision of  the investigator in cha rge and the engine manufacturer's local 
representative.  
2.8. On 26 August  2014  the a eroplane 's propeller was inspected  at a propeller overhaul facility  
under the supervision of the investigator in charge .  
2.9. On 23 June 2016  the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.10.  Submissions were received from two of the interested persons , including a substantial 
submission from the operator .  The Commission has considered all submissions and any 
chang es as a result of those submissions have been included in this report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  Glenorchy Air (the operator) was based at Queenstown Airport and carried out scenic and 
charter flights around the lower South Island and to Milford Sound.  An American couple  had 
booked a 'Three Rings '2 scenic flight with the operator, while on holiday . 
3.1.2.  At about 0800  on 5 August 2014, the pilot  arrived  at Queenstow n Airport to prepare  for the 
flight .  His preparations included checking the weather conditions; telephoning  the landowner 
at one of the remote aerodromes  he planned to use ; lodging a company flight plan;  
completing a load sheet3; and conducting a pre -flight inspection of the allocated aeroplane , a 
Cessna 172.  
3.1.3.  The two passengers  arrived at Queenstown Airport just before 0900 .  They met the pilot , who 
gave them a safety briefing and discussed the tour's itinerary with them  before they  boarded 
the Cessna .  However,  a technical problem with the Cessna's radio  meant the pilot h ad to 
take a larger aeroplane, a Piper PA32 -300 regist ered  ZK-DOJ (the aeroplane) .  
3.1.4.  The pilot  amended the flight plan to show the different aeroplane , but he did not complete a 
new load  sheet .  He fuelled the a eroplane  to about 250 litres , which provided an endurance 
of over four hours .  This quantity of fuel was more than the standard fuel load  required  for the 
planned flight time of  two hours 42 min utes4.  The pilot  briefed the passengers about the 
different features of the aeroplane compared with the Cessna .  The male passenger s at in the 
front right -hand seat  because  he was unfamiliar with small  aircraft  and had a tendency to 
suffer motion sickness .  His wife  sat in the  left seat in the centre row, directly behind the pilot .   
3.1.5.  They departed Queenstown at 1116 , nearly two hours later than originally planned .  The 
passengers recalled some turbulence on the flight , and  said that the pilot was very 
considerate of their  comfort and kept them informed  throughout the flight . 
3.1.6.  At 1155  they arrived overhead  Ben Ohau Station , circled once  around the airstrip  and landed .  
After landing  the pilot contacted the oper ator via cell phone  and gave  an update  on their 
progress .  They  spent about 20 minutes at this film location  before departing  for Mount 
Sunday , about 25 minutes ' flight time to the northeast.   At 1247  they arrived overhead  Mount 
Sunday  and circled around the hill.  Photos taken by the passengers showed the turns , which  
they descr ibed as being made "tightly"  at approximately 45 degrees angle of bank5. 
3.1.7.  The tour then proceeded to Omarama aerodrome where they stopped for lunch  at about 
1330 .  The passengers said the pilot ate lunch with them  inside the airport building,  then 
went to check the a eroplane  and update the operator again.   They departed Omarama at 
1424  for Poolburn , about 25  minutes ' flight time to the south.   Poolburn was the  final stop of 
the tour  before returning to Quee nstown.  
3.1.8.  GPS (global positioning system ) flight path data recovered from an on -board iPad6 showed 
that the aeroplane  approached the Poolburn airstrip from the north  at approximately  1,000 
feet above ground level (AGL) , then circled the airstrip  before descending and approaching  
the runway from a  northeasterly  direction .  According to the passengers t here were cows on 
                                                        
2 The 'Three Rings' tour was a scenic flight to 'The Lord of the Rings' filming locations at Ben Ohau station, 
Mount Sunday and the Poolburn Reservoir.    
3 A load sheet shows the weight  and distribution of the items that make up th e loaded weight of an aircraft.  
4 The company used standard flight plans for its regular tours.  For the 'Three Rings' tour the standard 
flight time was 162 minutes and the min imum fuel load 213 litres when using the PA32.  
5 The angle of bank  is the angle at which an aircraft's wings are  inclined about its longitudinal axis , with 
respect to the horizontal.  
6 The aircraft carried an iPad so that passengers could follow the tour o n a live map and access 
information about 'The Lord of the Rings' movies.   Pilots could also refer to it for accurate estimated arrival 
times.

 Final report AO -2014 -004 the airstrip  and the pilot flew the aeroplane on a low pass along the runway to scare them 
away.  The pilot  flew along  the runway between  100 feet and  150 f eet AGL, at a 
groundspeed7 of approximately  95 k nots (see Figure 1) .  After passing over the airstrip t he 
aeroplane  remained at approximately 150 feet  AGL then turned left .  The groundspeed 
increased  to 123  knots before the rate of turn8 increased  and the groundspeed decreased to 
below 60 knots , at which time the aircraft struck  the ground.    
3.1.9.  The pilot was killed, and the two passengers were seriously injured.  The aeroplane was 
substantially damaged.

3.1.10.  When interviewed, t he male passenger described essentially the same  flight path  as 
described above.  He said that when they flew over the airfield the pilot "apologised that we 
were going to have to bank fairly tightly to make passes over the field to chase them  [the 
cows] off".  He recalled see ing the cattle and remembered the final turn , stating;  
"we banked tightly, very sharply, almost wing tip vertical and the ground came 
up suddenly off one side and me saying something like 'look out' and he [the 
pilot] saying 'what ?' or being surprised" .  
His next recollection was after the accident , "being huddled over the wing , on the ground ". 
The other pas senger could not recall the accident  flight or the accident itself.  
                                                        
7 The groundspeed is the speed of an object over the ground , and is affected by wind.  For example, if an 
aircraf t flies at an indicated airspeed of 100 knots into a headwind of 20 knots the groundspeed will be 80 
knots; if it is a 20 -knot tailwind the groundspeed will be 120 knots. A knot is a speed of one nautical mile 
per hour, equal to 1.85 kilometres per hour . 
8 The rate of turn is the rate at which an aircraft heading changes,  expressed in degrees per second .

 3.1.11.  At 1453 Rescue Coordination Centre  New Zealand  (RCC) received a n alert  from the 
aeroplane's  emergency locator transmitter ( ELT)9.  RCC cont acted the operator , who 
confirm ed the aeroplane and its location from SPOT Tracker™10 data .  Shortly after this RCC 
was notified by emergency services of an emergency 111  call from  the female passenger .   
3.1.12.  The first rescue helicopter arrived on scene a t 1548, shortly after  a local helicopter pilot had 
arrived with a police officer from Alexandra .  A second rescue helicopter arrived shortly 
afterwards and b oth passengers were airlifted to Dunedin hospital for medical treatment.  
3.2. Site information  
3.2.1.  The accident site was approximately 750 m south of the Poolburn airstrip and 700 m north of 
the Poolburn R eservoir.  The terrain from the airstrip towards the reservoir rose approximately 
150 feet above the airstrip and was covered with rocky outcrops.  Towards the northwest of 
the airstrip the terrain gently sloped downwards and was covered in tussock and grass.  
3.2.2.  The aeroplane struck the terrain in a left -wing -low and nose -down attitude, on a northerly 
heading.  At this point the left -wing -tip fuel tank, the left wing and left landing gear detached 
and the aeroplane bounced once.  During this sequence the nose landing gear detached.  The 
aeroplane fuselage came to rest upright with the right landing gear detached (see Figure 2 ). 
3.2.3.  Fuel from the ruptured left -wing -tip tank was around the accident site, and there was fuel 
present in the main fuel tanks inside the wings.  A sample was taken from the right main fuel 
tank.  
                                                        
9 An emergency locator transmitter  or ELT automatically transmits a signal when activated by accident 
forces.  The signal is received by satellites that ca n pinpoint the transmitter location.  
10 SPOT Tracker  is a tracking device that sends GPS position reports to a receiver at set time intervals.

3.3. Personnel information  
3.3.1.  The pilot held a co mmercial pilot licence ( aeroplane ) that had been  issued  in April 2008 .  He 
had obtained  a PA32 series type rating in 2009, and at the time of the accident had accrued 
approximately  160 flight hours on the type .  He had logged 2 ,181 flight hours in total on 
aeroplanes .  
3.3.2.  The pilot held a valid CAA Class 1  medical  certificate11.  In 2008  the pilot had been assessed 
by the CAA as having an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.   
3.3.3.  The pilot had recently returned from a three -month bre ak from flying and had resumed flying 
duties two days before the accident flight .  On h is first day back he had flown  three solo 
circuits at Queenstown Airport in a Cessna 172 to regain currency12 on that type, then  a flight  
to Milford Sound with passengers  using a GA8 a eroplane  on which he was still current .  On 
the day before the accident flight  he had flown  three solo circuits in the aeroplane  to regain 
currency in the PA32 aircraft type, then operated one return flight to Milford Soun d in a GA8 
and another in the aeroplane  involved in this accident .  He had worked one half -day and one 
eight -hour duty day  in the two -day period  before the accident.

 3.3.4.  The operator's  staff at Queenstown Airport said the pilot appeared to be well rested and in 
good spirits on the day of the accident .   
3.4. Aircraft information  
3.4.1.  The Piper PA32 is a six -seat, low -wing  aeroplane  that first flew in 1965 .  Glenorchy  Air had 
operated  the aeroplane  since 1996.  
3.4.2.  At the time of the accident the aeroplane  had accrued 8 ,099 hours .  The 300-horsepower 
Lycoming engine had accrued 6 ,055 h ours and 1 ,621 hours since its last overhaul .  The 
propeller had accrued 1 ,991 h ours and 682 h ours since  overhaul .  There w as no outstanding  
maintenance or defects, and the a eroplane  had be en issued with a valid  airworthiness 
certificate.   
3.4.3.  Company pilots reported  that the aeroplane  had no unusual mechanical or handling 
characteristics , other than noting  that the fuel management system was more complex than 
other aircraft in the fleet.  
3.4.4.  The weight and centre o f gravity13 of the a eroplane  at the time of the accident were 
calculated using  the: 
 actual  basic weight of the a eroplane  
 actual weight of the pilot  
 actual we ights of personal items carried  
 estimated  passenger weights  
 estimated weights of other miscellaneous  aeroplane  items  
 calculated  fuel load on board (102  litres) .   
The weight at the time of the ac cident was calculated to be approximately 1,215 kilograms .  
The maximum allowable weight was 1 ,545 kilograms .  The centre of gravity was calculated to 
be approximately 203 centimetres  aft of the datum14, within the allowable range of  193-244 
centimetres  aft of the datum.  
Fuel system  
3.4.5.  The fuel system consist ed of two alumin ium tanks contained in the inboard leading edge 
section of the  wings , plus two fib reglass tanks, one located in each wing tip  (see Figure 3 ).  
The main tanks ha d a maximum capacity  of 95 litres each  and the tip tanks had a maximum 
capacity of 64 litres each .  Fuel was taken from each tank to a combination fuel selector 
valve and strainer located under the floor below  the middle seats .   
3.4.6.  The fuel selector  control  was located  below  the centre of the instrument panel .  It ha d a 
position for each of the fuel tanks and one OFF position .  From the selector valve, fuel was 
drawn through  the elect ric fuel pump then an engine -driven pump and on  to the fuel injector 
and the fuel nozzles .  Four electric fuel quantity gauges and a fuel pressure gauge were  
mounted on the right side of the instrument panel .  A pilot c ould turn the electric fuel pump 
'ON' or 'OFF' by using  a switch located below the pilot's side window . 
                                                        
13 The centre of gravity is the single point in an aircraft through which its total weight (and the force of 
gravity) can be consider ed to act .

3.4.7.  The operator 's Pilot Operational Supplement outline d procedures for fuel management for the 
PA32 -300.  The supplement noted "most forced landings in PA32's have been caused by fuel 
starvation by inadvertently running a tank dry or not changing tanks properly"15. The 
operator's procedures took into account the additional  information in the aircraft  Owner's 
Manual, and  include d: 
 pre-flight checks and fuel contamination checks  
 fuelling procedures  
 recording of fuel quantities on the load sheet and back of the hand  
 in-flight fuel management , including fuel tank se lection and electric fuel pump us e. 
Stall warning system  
3.4.8.  The PA32 -300 stall warning indicator is a red warning light positioned on the upper left side 
of the instrument panel , designed to alert pilots to an approaching aerodynamic stall16.  The 
stall warning indicator is activated by a lift detector  vane  installed on the front  of the left wing .

 It activate s at speeds between 5 and 10 miles per hour  (mph)17 (4-9 knots) above the stall 
speed .  The stall warning system is checked during the pre -flight inspection by turning the 
master switch 'ON,' lifting the  detector vane and checking if the stall warning light 
illuminates18.   
3.5. Wreckage examination  
3.5.1.  All major componen ts of the aircraft were recovered  and transported  to the Commission's 
wreckage examination and storage facility.  The engine was removed and sent to an engine 
overhaul facility for inspection and component testing.   Fuel samples taken from the right 
main fuel tank and the main f uel filter were clean and clear  and were the correct type of fuel.  
Flight c ontrols  
3.5.2.  The a eroplane  was fitted with one control column19, on the left side of the cockpit .  The 
control column was  found in the full aft position, bent downwards  and to the left .  Control 
continuity was con firmed to the elevator20 and the right aileron21 and from the  rudder pedals 
to the  rudder22.  No evidence was found of a pre-existing  failure of the flight controls.   
Engine, propeller and cockpit engine controls  
3.5.3.  The engine was examin ed under the supervision of the investigator in charge and the engine 
manufacturer's local representative .  The examination found that the ignition, fuel  (see 
Appendix 1)  and oil system components , accessory drives and gears were all serviceable , and 
that the crankshaft was free to turn .  No e vidence was found of a pre -existing  failure of the 
engine or its components.  
3.5.4.  All three propeller blades were found attached to the propeller hub and bent backwards 
towards the engine cowl  (see F igure 4).  There was lit tle damage to the blade tips, edges or 
surface s.  The pattern of bending and lack of significant scoring marks in the ground or on the 
blades suggested  that the propeller had been  turning at low power  at impact .  The propeller 
was remo ved and sent to a propeller exam ination and overhaul specialist . No evidence was 
found during the examination of a pre -existing  failure of the propeller.  
                                                        
17 The PA 32 -300 Owner's manual refere nced all speeds in miles per hour (a mile being an imperial speed 
measurement that  equates to 1.6 kilometres per hour or 0.87 knots ).  In New Zealand the knot is the 
commonly used speed measurement, in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organizat ion 
standards.  
18 On later -model PA32 -300 aeroplanes a horn was added to the stall warning system to give pilot s an 
additional aural warning.  
19 The control column is used by the pilot in conjunction with other controls to change direction and 
altitude.   
20 The elevator is a moveable surface on the tail of the aircraft, and is used to pitch the aircraft.  It changes 
the aircraft's nose in relation to the horizon - termed the aircraft's 'pitch attitude'.  
21 The ailerons are moveable surfaces on the outboard tra iling edge of each wing, and are used to bank 
the aircraft.   
22 The rudder is a moveable surface on the tail fin of the aircraft, and is used to move the aircraft's nose 
left or right.

 Instruments  and stall warning light  
3.5.6.  The altimeter subscale wa s set to 1 ,011 hectopascals,  which approximated the area 
atmospheric pressure  at the time of the accident .  The aeroplane 's radios were still powered 
when the first responders attended the site.  The aeroplane  was not fitted  with an artificial 
horizon25.   
3.5.7.  The a eropla ne's stall warning light was intact  and the stall warning vane26 on the left wing  
was undamaged .  As the left wing had separated from the a eroplane  it could not be tested on 
site.  However, the  stall warning vane and light were i nspected later  and found to be 
functional .   
3.6. Meteorological information  
3.6.1.  Strong westerly to northw esterly winds of 30-40 k nots were forecast for  the area at the time 
of the accident .  According to the area weather forecast for the Southland region, the wind  
strength  would increas e throughout the day ahead of  an approaching front, and occasional 
moderate turbulence could be expected i n the area.  
3.6.2.  Aerodrome weather forecasts  (refer Appendix 2)  for Alexandra and Dunedin, the two closest 
aerodromes to the accident site , forecast the win d at 2,000 feet to increase to 40  knots  later 
in the afternoon , with scattered cloud.  
3.6.3.  The pilot of the first rescue helicopter said it took  30 minutes to fly from Dunedin to Poolburn 
due to a 30-40 knot headwind .  He said that at the accident site it was a  clear day , with a 
northw esterl y wind of 10 -15 knots  and "smooth".  
3.6.4.  The local helicopter pilot who was first to  the accident site also reported a clear , sunny day 
with a north to northwest wind  estimated  to have been 20-25 knots . 
3.7. Aerodrome information  
3.7.1.  Poolb urn airstrip  was a non-certificated27 aerodrome  and was not promulgated in the 
Aeronautical Information Publication of New Zealand28, nor was it required to be .  The operator 
had an airstrip  register  as required by Civil Aviation Rules (CAR) Part 13 5.77.  The register  
included the following details for Poolburn  airstrip : 
 2,750 f eet above sea level  
 runway orientated approximately north east to south west  
 2% downhill gradient on the north runway  
 900 m take -off distance av ailable on a surface of hard , short grass  
 prevailing wind is a cross -wind from the  west.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The Commission determined th at an  aerodynamic stall  (stall)  occu rred during a  turn at low 
level.  There was insufficient height above ground  to allow the pilot to recover the aircraft , and 
the left wing  tip struck  terrain shortly after it stalled.  
4.1.2.  Three scenarios were considered as possible reasons for the aeroplane havin g stalled:  
 pilot incapacitation  
 mechanical or engin e failur e  
 the pilot 's mishandling  of the a eroplane  during a low-level manoeuvre .   
These scenarios are discussed below.  
4.1.3.  Aircraft equipment  and the operator's procedures,  as well as  regulations and guidelines 
around stock -clearing manoeuvres , are also discussed.  
4.2. Pilot incapacitation  
4.2.1.  The passengers , who had been with the pilot for more than  five hou rs, recall ed that he had 
been  in good spirits and not showing any visible  signs of ill health .  The front passenger 
recall ed that th e pilot was responsive in the moments le ading up to the stall .  The GPS flight 
path  data show ed that the aircraft was flown at a relatively constant height and that the rate 
of turn was maintained until it increased shortly before the crash.   This, along with the bent 
throttle control lever,  suggest ed that th e pilot had been  in control of the a eroplane . 
4.2.2.  The pilot had been assessed by the CAA as having an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease 
due to higher -than -normal levels  of cholesterol and a history of smoking.  As a result he had 
been subjected to regular cardiovascular stress test ing.  In spite of the perceived  elevated 
risk, the stress testing had not indicated any functional abnormality.   In addition, the  post-
mortem examination found  no pre -existing condition that might  have incapacitated the pilot.  
4.2.3.  The operator suggested that the pilot may have been affected by a neurological condition 
called Transient Global Amnesia (TGA), that could have resulted in a loss of contr ol.  
According to the CAA's medical manual29, TGA is a 'transient loss of memory' involving 
complete or partial amnesia.  During a TGA episode there is 'no alteration to conciousness' 
and there is 'preservation of immediate memory, personal identity, and cognition'.  There is 
also a 'preservation of motor skills' and 'complex tasks are preserved, such as the ability to 
drive', which suggests that a loss of control would be very unlikely due to TGA.  
4.2.4.  The Commission's aviation medical consultant30 was asked to  assess the likelihood of an 
episode of TGA having been a contributory factor.  After reviewing the post -mortem 
examination report and the pilots medical history, he determined it was 'extremely unlikely' 
that the pilot had experienced TGA.   
4.2.5.  A toxicologic al examination of the pilot found no performance -impairing substances and the 
carbon monoxide level in his blood was in the normal range for a smoker.  It was therefore 
very unlikely that the pilot had been physically incapacitated before the stall.

 Final report AO -2014 -004 4.3. Mechanical or engine failure  
Flight controls and fuel supply  
4.3.1.  No evidence of a pre -existing  mechanical  failure was  found , and flight control continuity was 
confirmed between  the cockpit controls and the flight control surfaces .  The aircraft 's fuel 
system integrity was confirmed , and the electric boost pump and fuel tank selector valve 
functioned correctly.  Fuel was present in the lines from the selected tank  (the right main ) to 
the selector valve and to the engine.  A significant amount of fuel was also draine d from  both  
main fuel tank s at the accident site.  
4.3.2.  The aeroplane  departed  Queenstown with approximately 250 litres of fuel on board, then flew 
to Ben Ohau and to Omarama , a total flight time of about two hours.  As the normal fuel 
consumption was  about 60 litres an hour, approximately  120 litres of fuel would have been 
used by the time it landed at Omarama.  The pilot did not refuel at Omarama although fuel 
was available there.  Therefore there would have been an estimated  130 litres on departure, 
which was  sufficient for the 60 minutes of  flight time to return to Queenstown via Poolburn .   
4.3.3.  The operator's  fuel management  procedures for the aeroplane  required  pilots  to writ e down 
the fuel levels in the fuel tanks prior to each departure .  Fuel quantity gauges in older 
aeroplanes  are often  unreliable,  so pilots measure d the fuel tank levels manually , using a 
wooden dipstick  to establish  the amount of fuel i n each tank.  Pilot s would then  write down 
the fuel quantities on their hand s as they 'dipped ' the tanks.   
4.3.4.  The pilot had the following numbers writte n on his left hand : 15-3-4-45.  The wooden dipstick 
cannot measure  quantities as low as  three or four litres.  T herefore it is likely  that the 
numbers  in full  were  actually '15-3[0]-4[0]-45'.  This would have meant  there was 15 litres in 
the left tip tank, 30 litres in the left main tank, 40 litres in the right main tank, and 45 litres in 
the right tip tank prior to departin g Omarama.  This gave  a total of 130 litres on board, which 
is the same as was calculated  based on the  fuel load departing Queenstown , the average fuel 
consumption rate , and the total flight time.  
4.3.5.  The fuel system allowed  only one tank to be selected at a time.  T he operator's fuel 
management procedures required pilot s to take off and land with the fullest main tank 
selected, and to balance the fuel distribution every half hour by changing tanks  as required .  
The pilot had a notebook in wh ich he record ed the times when he switched tanks and 
reminders of when to chang e tanks .  There was a note on  the day of the flight that said 
"change  right  main  @ 1455 ", which suggest ed he intended  to select the right main tank at 
that time .   
4.3.6.  If the pilot had followed the normal procedure , he would have taken off from Omarama with 
the right main tank  selected .  After take -off he would have selected the right tip tank for half 
an hour to correct  the fuel imbalance, then selected th e fullest main tank prior t o landing.  
The aircraft departed Omarama at 1425, so the fuel distribution  would have been nearly 
balanced  by 1455 .  However , the pilot would have  started  descending as  they approached  
the Poolburn airstrip about five minutes prior to this , at 1450.  He would have turned the fuel 
boost pump on and changed to the fullest main tank before he commenced his descent , as 
this was  the standard operating procedure  for the aircraft.   
4.3.7.  At the time of the accident  the electric  boost pump was on and th e right main fue l tank was 
selected.  This was consistent with the pilot having followed  the fuel management procedure 
and should  have meant there was at least 30 litres of fuel in the right main tank , which  was 
supplying the engin e.  Therefore the pilot's management of t he fuel system  was considered to 
have been in accordance with the operator's procedures and was not a contributing factor.

 Engine and cockpit controls  
4.3.8.  The engine , fuel control unit  (see Appendix 1)  and ignition system were  inspected at a 
specialist engine overhaul facility  (see paragraph 3. 4.12).  No pre -existing  defects were found 
that would have caused a loss in power.  The propeller was inspected at a specialist propelle r 
overhaul facility (see paragraph 3. 4.13).  No pre -existing  defects were foun d, and it was 
dete rmined that the propeller had been  under low power  when it struck the ground . 
4.3.9.  The engine throttle lever was found in the idle position and bent sideways to the left .  The 
pilot had an injury to his right hand that indicat ed it was very likely that he had been  holding  
the throttle when the a eroplane hit  the ground.  The throttle could not be moved out of this 
position after the accident, which  suggested that the throttle was at idle prior to ground 
impact .  The pre -impact i dle position  support ed the conclusion from the propeller examination  
that the propeller was at low power when it hit the ground .  One explanation for a low power 
setting  is that the pilot closed the throttle when he realised that a crash  was imminent . 
4.3.10.  The mix ture lever that controlled the fuel-to-air ratio  within the induction system was found in 
a partially leaned pos ition after the acci dent.  In order to maintain the same fuel-to-air ratio,  
the amount of fuel supplied to an engine needs to be reduced as an a ircraft climbs, due to 
the reduction of air p ressure as  altitude  increases .  As a rule of thumb, o perating at altitudes 
above 3,000 feet  require s the mixture to be leaned  by moving the lever rearward.  T he lever is 
returned to the full forward or rich position as part of the before -landing checklist during the 
final approach to land.  The aeroplane had been flown to Poolburn at an altitude  of about 
7,000 feet,  so this would have required the fuel mixture to be leaned.   
4.3.11.  The aircraft was not fully config ured for landing and was not on the final approach to land, so 
the pilot ma y not have completed the before -landing checklist and may not have returned the 
mixture lever to full forward position.  The lever could also have been moved by one of the 
occupants  as they exited the aircraft after the accident.  
4.3.12.  Both passengers had been briefed by the pilot on the normal changes in engine sound  to be 
expected during the flight . Neither passenger could recall any abnormal  or unexpected  engine 
sound s at any stage.  Had there been an engine failure following the stock -clearing pass, 
there were two alternate airstrips to the southw est of Poolburn airstrip  that could have been 
used.  T he operator said the pilot was likely to have known of them .  However, t he GPS flight 
track show ed that after the low pass the a eroplane continu ed to turn, and increas ed in 
altitude and speed .  This  suggested that  the engine was producing normal power during the 
turn.  
4.4. The low -level  mano euvre 
4.4.1.  Both passengers reca lled the pilot telling them that during the flight he  might have to move 
stock from one or more of the airstrips to en able them to land.  He said that this would 
involve  flying at low level over the airstrip to sc are the stock off the landing area , and that it 
might require several passes at low level  with tight turns . 
4.4.2.  Two of the airstrips, Ben Ohau and Poolburn, were on farm s and accessible to stock.  N either 
passenger could recall stock being on the Ben Ohau ai rstrip, and the GPS flight path data 
showed that the a eroplane  circled around the airstrip  once  before landing .  This suggested  
that the pilot  assessed the airstrip and  looked for any animals on  the landing area, but found 
none.  The pilot had also called the farm  owner at Ben Ohau to check the condition of the 
airstrip before departing Queenstown.  Finding  
2. A mechanical or engine failure  was highly unlikely to have been a 
contribut ing factor . 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -004 4.4.3.  According to the owner of the Poolburn airstrip, no -one telephoned to ask about the condition 
of the airstrip, including whether stock would be present, on 5 August 2014.   The front 
passenger recall ed seeing cattle on the Poolburn airstrip and that the pilot attempted to clear 
the animals off the landing area by flying over them at low level.  He recalled  the pilot saying 
that cows were stubborn .  The passenger said, "We were banking tightly while circling to 
chase the co ws away" and that  "it was making me uncomfortable", so he stopped looking 
outside the window.   He remember ed looking outside again just before the accident and 
seeing the ground coming towards them, that he warned the pilot , and that the pilot "seemed 
surprised about that ". 
4.5. Flight path data  
4.5.1.  The GPS flight path  data (se e Figure s 1 and 6 ), recovered from the on-board  iPad, showed the 
aeroplane  flying in a wide arc  around the airstrip before des cending and flying directly above  
the airstrip at a height estimated at between 100  and 150 feet  AGL.  About halfway along the 
airstrip the aeroplane was turned to the left  through approximately 180 degrees .  Its 
groundspeed initially increased during the turn , then decreased rapidly just before impact.  
4.5.2.  The rate of turn31 was initially moderate, then a southerly direction  was maintained  for about 
400 m before the aeroplane turned left in a tighter turn.  The turn radius  of the initial turn 
away from the airstrip approximated that  of a turn made with 30 degr ees angle of bank in still 
wind (see F igure 6 , dashed red  line).  The smaller turn radius  during the last part of the turn 
would have required 45 to 60 degrees angle of bank.

 4.5.3.  Figure 6  shows the flight track  (in magenta) of th e aeroplane  as displayed  on the on-board  
iPad by an application  called AirNav ProTM.  Due to buffering of the GPS data, and i n order to 
show a 'live' view of the flight , the application had to pred ict the next position of the 
aeroplane .  This feature has resulted in an impossibl e track being depicted between the 
points at  89 knots  and 16  knots .  This part of the data is invalid, and was most likely caused 
by the  software predict ing the position  shown at the 60 knots  point  then 'filling in'  the track to 
the final data point at 16 knots.  I n fact  the aeroplane stalled at about the 89 knots point and 
followed a line between the 89 knots  point and the crash site . 
4.5.4.  The dashed red  line in Figure 6  represents the calculated  radius (380  m) of a turn carried out 
in still air (no wind) with an entry airspeed of 90 knots and 30 degrees angle of bank.  The 
dashed yellow  line at the bottom of the figure  represents the expected flight track  of a turn 
carried out in the wind conditions present at the time (15 -20 knots  from the northwest ) and 
with 30 degrees angle of bank.  The rate of turn  is the same  for both , but with a tailwind more 
ground is covered during the turn.  This put the aircraft clos er to the higher  terrain to th e 
south of the airstrip, and the pilot would have had to increase the rate of turn or climb to 
avoid it.  
4.5.5.  The a eroplane 's altitude increased slightly during the initial part of the turn,  from  2,866 feet 
(GPS altitude33) to 2 ,912 feet.  During the fina l part of the turn it increased  to 2,955 feet 
before rapidly decreasing to 2,760 feet, the altitude of the accident site .  The terrain 
surrounding the airstrip consisted of rocky outcrops  and shallow  gullies , with lower  terrain to 
the n orthwest  and a rocky ridge  about 170 feet higher,  800 m to the s outh east of the airstrip .  
The a eroplane 's height above ground increased to about 200 feet during the initial part of the 
turn, bu t prior to the final part of the  turn it decr eased to abo ut 100  feet due to the rising 
terrain ahead.  
4.5.6.  When the front passenger recalled seeing ground coming at them, he may have been 
referring to the higher ground on his side (to the r ight of the a eroplane ) that they were 
approaching  before or during  the final part of the turn.  The pilot may not have seen the 
terrain from his position on the  left-hand  side of the a eroplane  (which was in a left turn) , or he 
may have been looking back over his left shoulder to see if the cows had moved off the 
airstrip.  Either way , according to the passenger in the right -hand seat the pilot  had seemed  
surprised by  how close the aeroplane was coming to the high terrain , and likely  attempted to 
increase the rate of turn by increasing the angle of bank.  
The stall  
4.5.7.  The stall speed of a PA32 -300 in level flight , in the same configuration and at the same 
weight as the aeroplane  at the time of the accident, is  about 55 knots .  When an a eroplane  is 
banked in a turn there is an increase in the load ( weight or G) factor, a nd the vertical 
component of lift is reduced (see Appendix 3 ).  A stall will occur at a higher airspeed  in a turn 
than when in  level flight .  In a 30 -degree ang le of bank turn the stall speed is 1.1 times the 
stall speed in level flight (61  knots ), at 45 degrees it is 1.2 (66  knots ), and at 60 degrees it is 
1.4 (77  knots ).  The groundspeed recorded by the GPS unit as the a eroplane  was partway 
through the final turn  was 89  knots  and reducing as the rate of turn increased .  The re was a 
tailwind of 5-10 knots  at that  point, so the airspeed was probably closer to 80  knots  and 
approaching the stall speed for a 60 -degree  angle of bank  turn (77  knots ). 
4.5.8.  The front passenger recalled the a eroplane  "banking sharply"  to "almost vertical" .  This was  
likely to have been eith er an increase in the angle of bank  by the pilot to increase the rate of 
turn, or the left wing dropping when the a eroplane  stalled.  When an a eroplane  stalls in a 
turn, the inside wing stalls before the outside wing because it is travelling slower through the 
air.  As a result the inside wing drops further and the aeroplane  rolls further into the turn .  The 
aeroplane  struck the ground in a left wing and nose low attitude with a high vertical and low 
horizontal speed .  The ground im pact evidence support ed the conclusion that the a eroplane  
stalled while  in a left turn at low level.  The stall occurred when the a eroplane  was less than  
                                                        
33 GPS altitude is the height  above sea level, referenced to the WGS84 geodetic datum .  GPS altitudes ca n 
have an error of up to +/ - 75 feet, however it is typically accurate to within 20 feet.  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -004 150 feet above the ground, much less than  the minimum 300-400 feet  or more  required to 
recover the aircraft from a stall.  
Other factors  
4.5.9.  Having an  artificial horizon  installed in an aeroplane  can assist  a pilot in judging the ir angle of 
bank during a turn, especially when  at low level over  undulating terrain.  However,  there was 
no requirement for one  to be fitted for this type of operation, and the pilot was experienced  
with flying in mountainous terrain.  The a eroplane  was fitted with a turn and slip  indicator  that 
gave a basic indication of the rate of turn . 
4.5.10.  The lack of an aura l stall warning may have been a factor that prevented the pilot recognising 
an impending  stall and taking action to avoid it.  The stall warning light was operable, but i f 
the pilot had been looking out the side window in the direction of the turn he may not have 
noticed the light  illuminate .  A warning horn could ha ve immediately  drawn his attention to 
the impending stall.  Later-model PA32 -300 aeroplanes  were fitted with a stall warning horn 
as well as the light.  
4.5.11.  The outer scale of the airspeed indicator  (see Figure 8) was calibrated in  mph, while the 
smaller inner scale was in knots .  One knot is equal to about 1.15  mph .  The airspeed 
indicators in the other a eroplanes  the pilot regularly flew were calibrated in knots  only.  
According to the pilot's training records , he had  used knots when learning the airspeed 
limitations for th e PA32 -300 type rating .  The pilot could have read the airspeed off the outer 
scale (mph) thinking it was in knots, and thought they were flying faster than they actually 
were.   An airspeed of 90 mph on the outer scale would equate to about 77 knots (the stall 
speed at 60 degrees angle of bank) . 
 
Figure 7 
Airspeed indicator and stall warning light  (upper left)  
4.5.12.  The aeroplane  had a high ground speed34 during the majority of the turn due to the tailwind .  
This could have been interpreted as a high airspeed  by the pilot  if he was looking outside the 
cockpit and saw the ground  rushing past.  This illusion is exaggerated at low heights above 
ground , and  if a pilot reduces power to decrease the high ground speed, the  airspeed 
                                                        
34 Groundspeed is the speed that the aircraft flies over the ground and is affected by wind.  For example, if 
an aircraft flies at an indicated airspeed of 100 knots i nto a headwind of 20 knots the groundspeed will be 
80 knots, if it is a 20 knot tailwind the groundspeed will be 120 knots.

 decrease s.  The speed margin above the stall speed is also decreased because the aeroplane 
is turning  (see Appendix 3) .  
4.5.13.  Although it could not be determined whether these factors  contributed directly to the 
accident,  they would have made it harder for the pilot to recognise the dangerous situation 
that was developing.   
 
 
Finding  
3. The aeroplane  stalled  in a turn performed at low level during a stock -clearing 
manoeuvre . 
The operator's s tock clearing procedures  
4.5.14.  When flying into a farm or remote airstrip , it may sometimes be necessary to clear stock from 
the strip before a landing  can be made.   Usually  the pilot will fly along the airstrip at low level 
to scare the  stock to one  side.  After flying along the airstrip , the standard practice is to climb  
straight ahead  to at least 500 feet AGL before turning  and re -circuiting for the landing .  
4.5.15.  In this case the pilot  flew along the airstrip at low level , but instead of climbing straight ahead 
to 50 0 feet he maintained his height as he entered the left turn.   The front passenger recalled 
being told by the pilot that they would have to circle back to scare the cattle again.   
4.5.16.  The operator did not have any written procedure s for or guidelines on how to carry out stock 
clearing .  However, the Chief Pilot said that he had told his pilots that a low pass to scare 
stock should be done to one side of the airstrip, followed by a straight climb to 500 feet 
above the airstrip before turning.   He said that if stock did not move after one low-level pass, 
pilots should not make further attempts.  
4.5.17.  Other  pilots of the operator  had different views  on how stock clearing should be carried out.  
None of the pilots had been given flight instruction on t he manoeuvre, nor had they been 
assessed for their competency in carrying it out.  They offered a range of minimum heights for 
the manoeuvre, from 50 feet to 150 feet  AGL.  They also had different  views on whether it 
was necessary to climb straight ahead to 500 feet after the pass before turning.  
4.5.18.  In this case t he pilot had indicated that he would perform a second pass, and his low -level 
turn was consistent with that intention.   According to his logbook  he had performed multiple 
pass es to clear stock at Poolburn and at other airstrips  before .  This, and the different views 
of the operator's  pilots, showed that the Chief Pilot's verbal  instructions about stock clearing 
were either unclear  or being ignored.  
4.5.19.  Most  of the operator's pilots  said that the circuit35 direction at Poolburn was always to the 
left, which would take an aircraft towards the hi gher terrain when  approaching from the north .  
In this case , with  a strong crosswind from right to left , it would have been safer to turn  right  
into the wind , because  the terrain sloped do wn from the airstrip  and it would have resulted in 
a lower groundspeed .  It was not possible to determine whether the pilot had carried out 
stock clearing  in similar wind conditions , or if he had flown in a different circuit direction, 
during previous flights into Poolburn.  
4.5.20.  Alternatively, the pilot could have climb ed straight ahead to 500 feet  AGL before turning .  Had 
there been an engine failure during the low -level turn  to the left , there would have been  few 
options for a  safe landing  because  of the rocky terrain  and high groundspeed of the 
aeroplane .  
                                                        
35 The circuit is a rectangular path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing, while maintaining visual 
contact with the airf ield. 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -004 Finding  
4. The operator  believed that stock clearing was permitted, but  had no written 
guidelines and had not  given its pilots  flight training  in the manoeuvre.  
4.6. Civil Aviation Rule s 
4.6.1.  CAR did not define or ref er to stock clearing, nor was it  covered anywhere in the advisory 
circulars  or guidelines  published by the CAA .  The commercial pilot licence training syllabus 
did not include stock -clearing techniques.  The agricultural rating syllabus36 likewise  did not 
include a requirement for stock -clearing training.   
4.6.2.  CAR Part 91.127 states that no person may operate an aircraft at an aerodrome unless the 
runway is clear of all persons, animals, vehicles, or other obstructions during landing or take -
off.  It does not specifically prohibit a pilot from carrying out a low approach and overshoot to 
clear animals off the runway.  
4.6.3.  In accordance with CAR Parts 91 and 135 , the minimum height for visual flight rules (VFR) air 
transport flights is 500 fe et above the surface, or 500 feet above any obstacle within a 150 
m radius of the aircraft .  Aircraft must also not be operated at a height less than required to 
safely execute an emergency landing in the eve nt of an engine failure.   These  requirement s 
do not apply to the pilot in command of an aircraft conducting a take -off or landing, a balked 
landing or discontinued approach, or taxiing.  There is no definition in CAR Part 1 for balked 
landing or discontinu ed approach .   
4.6.4.  A low approach and overshoot involves an aircraft carrying out a normal approach to land, but 
it stops descending at low level before climbing straight ahead to 500 feet or more to circuit 
for landing or to depart the area.   On occasions  there may be good reason  to fly at low level 
along a runway or airstrip for a short distance before climbing away.  This manoeuvre is 
typically carried out to inspect an unprepared landing area for any hazards , prior to landing.  
4.6.5.  An article published in th e CAA safety magazine Vector in March 2012 , following  a low flying 
incident , discussed  low approach and overshoot manoeuvre s.  The pilot involved  in the 
incident was quoted as  saying , "A low pass down the runway was accepted common practice 
as part of a go -around [low approach and overshoot]" and that "the rules didn't prohibit the 
manoeuvre".  The published response from the CAA at the time was "just because the rules 
are silent on the matter doesn't make it an acceptable practice".  
4.6.6.  The pilot of the accident aeroplane  carried out a modified  low approach and overshoot , and 
instead of climbing out straight ahead after flying along the airstrip he turned at low level  in 
order  to make another low -level pass over the airstrip.  In the absence of any specific 
guidelines from the operator or within the civil aviation system regarding stock clearing, the 
pilot carried out what he  may have  thought was an acceptable manoeuvre for stock clearing.  
Entries  in the pilot's logbook , and the briefing he gave to t he passengers about making  "close 
passes" and "tight turns to get ba ck around" , suggest ed this may have been his  usual 
technique for  clear ing livestock that had not move d after the first pass . 
4.6.7.  The CAA w as asked  by the Commission  to clarify the requirements for operators who carry out 
stock clearing duri ng commercial or air transport operations.  Th e CAA responded by saying 
that stock clearance is not authorised under CAR Part 13 5.  The reason  the CAA gave was  
that CAR Part 91 , which applie s to all pilots  under all CAR, state s that pilots must ensure a 
runway is clear of animals during landing.  
4.6.8.  CAR Part 91 states  that a pilot is allowed to fly below 500 feet AGL for the purposes of taking 
off or la nding, and for carrying out a balked landing or discontinued approach.  As stock 
clearing could be interpreted as being a  form of balked landing or discontinued approach, 
                                                        
36 The agricultural rating training syllabus was reviewed, as it was considered by the investigation to be the 
most likely place to find any guidelines about stock -clearing procedures.   
 
Final report AO -2014 -004 
<< Page 21 >>
 and in the absence of any clear guidance from the CAA, the stock -clearing procedure could be 
interpreted as  being allowed.  
4.6.9.  This operator and others had been carrying out stock -clearing manoeuvres  for many years,  
possibly  in the belief that it was not prohibited under CAR.  The CAA 's view that  stock clear ing 
is not pe rmitted on an air transport flight may  not be shared by all aviation industry  
participants .  Therefore the Commission is recommending  that the Director of Civil Aviation 
provide appropriate guidance to the aviation industry on stock clearing.   
Finding  
5. There w as a lack of c larity on whether  stock clearing  was a permissible activity 
under the Civil Aviation Rules . 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -004 5. Findings  
5.1. Pilot incapacitation was very  unlikely to have been a contribut ing factor . 
5.2. A mechanical or engine failure  was very  unlikely to have been a contribut ing factor . 
5.3. The aeroplane  stalled in a turn performed at low level during a stock -clearing mano euvre.  
5.4. The operator  believed that stock clearing was permitted, but  had no  written guidelines and 
had not given its pilots fli ght training in the mano euvre. 
5.5. There was a la ck of clarity on whether  stock clearing  was a permissible activity under the Civil 
Aviation Rules .

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified by 
the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. No safety actions were identified . 
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.3. No safety actions  were identified . 
 
 
  

<< Page 24 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -004 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector .  In this case , a recommendation has  been issued to  the Civil Aviation Authority . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recomm endation  
7.3. The operator  involved in this accident had conducted stock -clearing manoeuvres with fare -
paying passengers on board, in the belief that it was not prohibited under  CAR. 
7.4. Anecdotal evidence suggests that other operators ha d been conducting similar stock -clearing 
manoeuvres, also in the belief that it was permitted.  
7.5. The CAA expressed an alternative view that pilots operating under CAR Part 135 were no t 
authorised to carry out stock clearing.  Its rationale for this view was t hat Rule Part 91, which 
applies to all pilots, states that a pilot must ensure  a runway is clear of animals during 
landing . 
7.6. There appeared  to be a difference between  what the CAA  said wa s an unauthorised activity 
and what the industry understood to be a pe rmitted activity.  
7.6.1.  Therefore, o n 24 August 2016  the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil 
Aviatio n provide a clear statement to relevant sectors of the aviation industry on whether 
stock  clearing is a permitted activity.  If the Director decides it is a permitted activity under a 
particular Civil Aviation Rule part, he should provide clear guidance on the conduct of the 
activity.  (019/16)  
On 7 September 2016  the Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
In our response to the Commission's draft re port, 11 August 2016, we explained there is no CAA 
rule provision for stock clearing; therefore, the Director cannot provide clear guidance on the 
conduct of the activity in the context of existing CA Rules.  
However, the CAA recognises that an operation to  a remote airstrip presents a risk to air transport 
in that the landing area may have visible hazards, including the presence of stock, which could 
affect the safety of a landing. Whilst there are no existing provisions in the rules to descend below 
500 fe et (aside for take -off/landing or a baulked landing/discontinued approach), the Director 
will agree to pursue a means to enable air transport operators to overfly a remote airstrip below 
500 feet for the purposes of ensuring the landing area is visibly fre e from hazards.  
The CAA remains focused on safety management based on risk mitigation. The CAA believes the 
alternative safety action will address the safety issue raised by the Commission and we will 
advise when the work has been completed.

 8. Key lesson s 
8.1. Flying  at close proximity to the ground requires a high degree of accuracy as there is little 
margin for error.  It is important that pilots are fully aware of the stall characteristics of their 
aircraft, in particular how they are affected by manoeuvres such as  steep turns.   Pilots should 
also be aware of the effect s of wind on the  amount of  ground covered during a turn.  
8.2. Operators must issue clear guidelines  and procedures for their  pilots  to follow, and ensure 
that they are being complied with.  Pilots should  be required to  regularly demonstrate 
proficiency in carrying out the types of manoeu vres and operations they perform for  the 
operator.

 Appendix 1: Fuel control unit inspection  
At the time of the accident CAA Airworthiness Directive37 DCA/MA/17 was applicable to Robinson R44 
II helicopters fitted with Lycoming  IO-540 series engines and Precision Airmotive RSA -10AD1 fuel 
control units (FCUs).  Teflon thrust washers inside these FCUs had shown signs of delamination, which 
had the potential to restrict fuel flow and cause a reduction in power.  The aeroplane's FCU  (part 
number RSA -10ED -1) used the same type of washer.  Therefore the possibility of a delaminated 
washer being a causal factor was examined in detail.  
The FCU was taken apart and inspected at an approved engine overhaul facility under the supervision 
of the investigator in charge.  The FCU, fuel nozzles, fuel filter and pump were tested and found to be 
serviceable and free of blockages.  However, a small amount of delamination was detected on washer 
part number  367757 (see Figure below ).  
 
Washer and debris  
The Commission notified the Director of Civil Aviation that similar delamination had been found on the 
washer from the aeroplane's FCU.  Following this and further reports from other aeroplane operators, 
the CAA issued Airworthiness Directive  DCA/MA/19 that was applicable to all aircraft fitted with RSA -
10ED1 model FCU s and other Precision Airmotive FCUs that contained the Teflon washer.  
Despite the breakdown of the washer material, the fuel nozzles and lines were clear of  any debris and 
there was no sign of any blockage s.

 Final report AO -2014 -004 Appendix 3 : Aerodynamic stalls and steep turns 
Introduction  
The following information has been copied in part from the Civil Aviation Authority Flight Instructor 
Guide Briefings for Basic Stalling, Advanced Stalling and Steep Turns.  This presentation of this 
information will be familiar to many New Zealand pilots.   Full briefings are available from 
https://www.caa.govt.nz/FIG/index.html . 
Aerodynamic Stall  
An aerodynamic stall is not like a stall in a car - the engine does not stop.  A erodynamic stall ing is the 
breakdown of smooth airflow over the wing into a turbulent flow, resulting in a decrease in lift.  The lift 
will no longer fully support the aeroplane's weight, and the aeroplane sinks.  The cause of this 
breakdown of smooth airflow is the result of the wi ng being at too high an angle of attack to the 
airflow.  For the average aerofoil used on general aviation aeroplanes, this limit is reached at an angle 
of attack of about 15  degrees.  
Lift is primarily controlled through angle of attack and airspeed, and lift must equal the aeroplane's 
weight t o maintain level flight.  A s the airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must be increased to 
maintain lift equal to weight.  
L = angle of attack x airspeed   
As the angle of attack increases, the airflow finds it mo re and more difficult to follow the contoured 
upper surface of the wing (aerofoil) smoothly, and the point at which the air flow breaks away from the 
wing ( the separation point)  moves forward from the trailing edge.  At the same time, the point through 
whic h lift acts, the centre of pressure (C of P), also mo ves forward ; this movement is unstable 
because it reduces the moment of the lift/weight couple. See Figure 1.  
 
 
Figure 1  
Changes in airflow and centre of pressure with increasing angle of attack  
Eventually, the stalling (or critical) angle of attack is reached, and the inability of the air to flow 
smoothly over the top surface of the wing results in a decrease in lift and a large increase in drag.  
The result is that the aeroplane sinks.  At the s ame time, the C of P moves rapidly rearward.  The 
rearward movement of the centre of pressure increases the moment provided by the lift/weight 
couple, causing the nose to pitch down in a stable movement.  
The aeroplane's manufacturer provides stalling speed s for one or more aircraft configurations as a 
guide to the pilot.  Although the critical angle remains constant, the stall speed will vary for other 
configurations and with several factors.  
Lift primarily varies with angle of attack and airspeed.  Since t he critical angle cannot be altered, 
anything that increases the requirement for lift will require an increase in airspeed to produce that lift. 
Therefore, when the critical angle is reached the airspeed will be higher.  Conversely, anything that 
decreases  the requirement for lift will decrease the airspeed observed at the stall.  
Weight

<< Page 31 >>
 An increase in weight will require an increase in lift, resulting in an increase in the stalling speed.  
Loading  
Loading, or load factor, is the name given to the force/a cceleration that the aeroplane must support, 
for example, in pulling out of a dive.  When you ride a roller coaster, at the bottom of the dip you feel 
heavier, as you're pushed into your seat by the force/acceleration of changing direction.  You haven't 
actually gained weight, but it feels that way.  For an aeroplane this is often referred to as apparent 
weight, or G, and this increase in apparent weight increases the requirement for lift, and thus it 
increases the stall speed.  
↑ apparent W → ↑ L → ↑ VS  
Power  
If the aeroplane had enough power, it could climb vertically (like a rocket) and there would be no 
requirement for lift at all.  So when thrust is inclined upwards, it decreases the requirement for lift and 
reduces the stalling speed.  In addition, th e slipstream generated by having power on increases the 
speed of the airflow and modifies the angle of attack (generally decreasing it) over the inboard 
sections of the wing. The increased airspeed increases the lift and reduces the aeroplane's stall 
speed . 
Flap  
Flap increases lift and therefore the stalling speed is reduced.  However, flap also changes the shape 
of the wing, and this results in a lower nose attitude at the stall.  
Although flap increases lift, it also increases drag - generally, about the first 15 degrees of flap 
increases lift with little adverse affect on the L/D ratio.  The application of any further flap rapidly 
increases drag, adversely affecting the L/D ratio.   
Steep Turns  
A steep turn is defined as a turn of more than 30 degrees angle of bank.  It is common practice for 
flight instructors to teach students to conduct steep turns at 45 degrees angle of bank.  
In order to turn the aeroplane , an acceleration towar ds the centre of the turn must be provided. This 
is done by banking the aeroplane with aileron.  It is the horizontal component of lift (centripetal force) 
that provides this acceleration towards the centre of the turn.  With the lift vector inclined, the vertical 
component of lift no longer supports the aeroplane's weight.  To maintain a constant altitude or 
height, the total lift vector must be increased so that the vertical component now equals the weight.  
Of the options available for increasing lift, c hanging the angle of attack is the most practical.  Any 
increase in lift will produce a corresponding increase in drag, and therefore, a reduction in airspeed.  
In the medium level turn, the lift and drag increases are very slight and the decrease in airsp eed is 
minor. The appropriate amount of backpressure on the control column achieves this.

Figure 2  
Forces in level flight and in the 45°angle of bank turn  
For a steep turn a greater turning (centripetal) force is required and so the aeroplane banks to a 
steeper angle than for a medium turn.  Therefore, increased lift is required in order to provide 
sufficient vertical component to equal weight and provide th e horizontal component.  The acceleration 
pushing the pilot into the seat is known as load factor (commonly referred to as G).  This is equal and 
opposite to lift, and the wings must support it.  
At 45 degrees the load factor is +1.4  G and at 60 degrees an gle of b ank the load factor is +2  G, and 
the occupants will feel twice as heavy.  The load factor is often referred to as apparent weight - 
because it is an acceleration (force) that the wings must support, similar to weight.  
 
Figure 3  
Forces in the 30°,  45°and 60 °angle of bank turn  
The stall speed in a manoeuvre  increases as the square root of the load factor (LF).  Assuming a stall 
speed of 55  knots in level flight, at 60 degrees angle of bank the stall speed will increase by the 
square root of the loa d factor +2 (√2), which is approximately 1.4. This means that, at 60 degrees 
angle of bank, the stall  speed is increased by 40% to 77  knots.

Figure 4 
Relationship of Load Factor, Bank Angle and Stall Speed  
At the same time, because lift is increased by increasing the angle of attack, adversely affecting the 
L/D ratio, the drag also increases, resulting in decreased airspeed.  
It is an undesirable situation to have the stall speed increasing and airspeed decr easing. Therefore, 
the power is increased to combat the increased drag to maintain a margin over the stall speed. This 
can be referred to as a power sandwich.  
 
Figure 5 
Power Sandwich  
As the increase in drag, load factor and stall speed is not linear, th e effect of increasing drag must be 
compensated by an increase in power in turns at angles of bank greater than 30 degrees.  At 45 
degrees angle of bank this in crease will be about 100 -200 RPM .
