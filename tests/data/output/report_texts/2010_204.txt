Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to determine 
the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in 
the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that rep orts should be used to assign fault or blame or 
determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been undertaken for 
that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implemen ting 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations over seas.  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport  accidents and 
incidents.

Report 10 -204 
<< Page 1 >>
 1. Executive summary  
1.1 At about 1930 on 21 June 2010 , the bulk carrier Hanjin Bombay  left the wharf at Mount 
Maunganui loaded with a full cargo of logs for the port of Kunsan  in Korea.  The vessel was 
under the control of a Port of Tauranga harbour pilot, with the master in command . 
1.2 The vessel was manoeuvred off the berth and turned in the channel using the main engine 
and 2 tugs.  Once the vessel was heading outward the vesse l's main engine was used to 
propel it seaward.  The 2 tugs remained with the ship until it was about to enter the narrow 
entrance channel, at which point they were released to return to their berths, but remained in 
radio contact with the pilot.  
1.3 As the Hanjin Bombay  began to increase speed, a malfunctioning valve in the engine cooling 
system caused the engine cooling water to rise above normal temperature.  The engine room 
crew did not alert the bridge to the problem, but instead began attempting to resolve  the 
cooling -water issue.  
1.4 Oblivious to the technical problem in the engine room, the bridge team took the Hanjin 
Bombay  into the narrow entrance channel and continued to increase the engine speed to 
improve the steering performance.  
1.5 The engine -cooling -wate r temperature continued to rise and reached the point where the 
engine safety control system automatically slowed the engine down , then shut it down 
completely to prevent it becoming permanent ly damaged.  
1.6 The Hanjin Bombay  was negotiating the turn from the Cutter Channel into No. 2  Reach when 
the engine shut down.  The loss of propulsion reduced the steering performance  of the vessel 
and the rudder  was unable to arrest the turn before the ship left the Channel and grounded on 
the eastern shore of the channel . 
1.7 The harbour pilot had radioed the tugs to return to the Hanjin Bombay , but they arrived at the 
vessel just after it had grounded.  The Hanjin Bombay  remained aground for about 2 hours 
until it refloated on a rising tide . 
1.8 The vessel received a hole in  one of its water -ballast tanks and indentations in the hull plating 
in the bow area.  There was no pollution and the ship later re -entered the port, where it 
underwent temporary repairs before resuming its voyage.  It later entered a dry -dock in China 
to effect permanent repairs.  
1.9 The Commission made findings  that the grounding could have been prevented if the 
automatic engine -shutdown  condition had been overridden for long enough to stabili se the 
heading of the vessel, and/or if the tugs had been in attendance to help maintain directional 
control.  Either option could have been achieved through better knowledge of the engine 
systems, better communication between the bridge and engine room cre w, and if the bridge 
crew had informed the harbour pilot of the escalating engine problem.  
1.10 Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its P ort and Harbour  Safety Management 
system did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure  of propulsion 
and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel.  
1.11 The Commission made recommend ations  that the Director of Maritime New Zealand resolve 
the safety issue of adequate tug escorts for vessels in all New Zealand ports , and t hat he 
develop a national system that would allow port authority staff access to new and previous 
information on vessel and crew performance in the interest s of preventing similar accidents 
and incidents in the immediate future.

 Report 10 -204 1.12 The key lessons  from the inquiry into this occurrence were:  
 vessel crews must have a thorough knowledge of their vessel s' operating systems if 
they are to deal effectively with abnormal situations  
 the concept of crew resource management must extend to all operational areas on a 
vessel , and in particular must result in a common understanding of the voyage plan and 
good communication between bridge and engine room  
 The level of tug assistance given to vessels when transiting narrow channels needs to 
be commensurate with the level of  risk and should be decided on the basis of reducing 
the risk to a s low as reasonably practicable  
 shipboard operations must be conducted using an agreed common language that 
everyone can understand.  Crew members lapsing into their native tongue during an 
emergency is a breakdown in communication that can seriously hinder any response to 
deal with the emergency.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 21 June 2010 at about 2130, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) was notified by Maritime New Zealand that the Hanjin Bombay  had earlier that 
evening run aground as it was leaving the port of Tauranga.  
2.2. The accident fell into the category  of a "serious casualty" as defined in the International 
Maritime Organization 's casualty investigat ion code.  The Commission opened an inquiry into 
the occurrence  under section 13(1)(b) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 
1990 . 
2.3. On 22 June 2010 the Commission notified the occurrence to the Flag S tate of the vessel, 
Panama .  The Commission and the Panama Maritime Authority agreed that the Commission 
would investigate the occurrence and would produce a report on behalf of Panama.  
2.4. On 23 June 2010 two investigators from  the Commission travelled from W ellington to 
Tauranga  to start th e site investigation .  On arrival the investigators were briefed by Maritime 
New Zealand investigators and members  from the port management team.  
2.5. During the next 2 days the investigators interviewed  the vessel 's crew , the  harbour pilot and  
others who had b een involved in the events leading up to the grounding.  Pertinent documents 
were sourced from the vessel, including those relating to the International Safety Management 
System .  Relevant data was also extracted from the Hanjin Bombay 's voyage data record er by 
the investigators.  
2.6. The i nvestigators interviewed relevant staff from the port company and sourced various 
pertinent documents supporting the Port Safety Management System . 
2.7. Following the first phase of the investigation , data was sourced from national  and 
international agencies, equipment manufacturers, the vessel owners and the vessel's 
classification society.   
2.8. On 12 December 2012  the Commission approved a draft final report for circulation to 
interested persons.   
2.9. The draft final report was sent to 16 interested persons  with a request that submissions  be 
forwarded to the Commission no later than 1 February 2013. Written submissions were 
received from Port of Tauranga Limited, the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal and Maritime 
New Zealand.  
2.10.  On 20 March 2013  the Commission approved the publication of the final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1 Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 15 June 2010 the bulk carrier Hanjin Bombay  arrived at No. 10 berth in the p ort of 
Tauranga.  The vessel discharge d its import cargo then loaded a full cargo of export logs 
during  the follow ing 5 days . 
3.1.2.  Loading of the logs was completed at about 0930 on  21 Jun e. The crew were then engaged in 
the lashing of the cargo , which was completed by about 1745 the same day.  A harbour  pilot 
boarded the vessel at about 1912  ready for a 1930 departure.  T he master arrive d on the 
navigating bridge at about 1918 , after completing departure formalities . 
3.1.3.  The following chronology of events has been developed mainly from data recorded on the 
vessel 's voyage data recorder  and other shipboard recording devices , and recordings of radio 
messages made by Port of Tauranga Limited , augmented with the recollections of those 
persons interviewed in connection with the grounding.  
Events on the navigating bridge  
3.1.4.  At about 1920 the master ordered standby engines (noted in the vessel 's log book as 1918) .  
The pilot then went through Port of Tauranga Limited 's passage plan with the master and 
explained the anticipated manoeuvres, speeds and courses.  
3.1.5.  At about 1925 a tug had been secured  forward and another tug was secured aft .  The pilot 
ordered all lines securing the vessel  to the wharf to be let go, which was accomplished by 
about 1930.  The pilot, with the aid of the tugs and the vessel 's main  engine , manoeuvred the 
Hanjin Bombay  away from the berth and turned the vessel in the channel to head outwards.  
3.1.6.  Once the vessel was turned and heading outwards the pilot ordered the tugs to be let go and 
at about 1941 the pilot increased the speed of the main  engine to half -ahead and conned the 
vessel through Maunganui Roads and into the Cu tter Channel.  The tugs provided a passive 
escort  (without a line attached) for  the Hanjin Bombay  as it transited Maunganui  Roads .  At 
about 19 49 the pilot was comfortable with the vessel 's engine performance, so he stood  
down the tugs  and increased the en gine speed to full  ahead.  The tugs then returned to their 
berths located at Mount Maunganui , but were asked by the pilot  to remain listen ing on very -
high-frequency radio channel 12, the working channel for the port of Tauranga .  At about 1951 
the Hanjin  Bombay  entered the Cutter Channel (see Figure 2) . 
3.1.7.  At about 195 4 the Hanjin Bombay  was abeam of C2 beacon and  the pilot was preparing to 
turn the vessel  out of the Cutter Channel into No.2 Reach .  At 1955 a 'main  engine  automatic  
slowdown ' alarm activated on the bridge engine alarm panel , which  was signalling to the 
bridge team  that the main engine  revolutions were automatically reducing  for some reason .  
The master did not bring this to the pilot's attention.  Instead he  telephoned the engine control 
room  and, speaking in Korean, asked if he should reduce the revolutions per minute  of the 
main  engine .  The master then said (in Korean) , "It's not possible, it is now just turning  - is it 
OK? - what  is your situation ?"  The master then ended the call and did not say anything to the 
pilot.  
3.1.8.  About one minute later the telephone on the navigating bridge rang and was answered.  By 
this time the vessel  had already entered the turn into No.2 Reach.  The next discernible words 
recorded were the pilot requesting the ma ster to not slow  the vessel  down .  He  (the pilot)  
asked why the engine was slowing  down  - what was wrong .  The master did not respond . 
Instead he  was heard telling the officer on the forecastle head (in English) to stand by the 
anchors (ready to let go ). 
3.1.9.  At about 1957 the vessel was approximately abeam of No.4 buoy .  The pilot was unable to 
ascertain from the master what the problem was with the main  engine , so he radioed  the tugs 
to return and stand  by to assist as soon as possible.  
  

<< Page 6 >>
 Report 10 -204  
3.1.11.  The engine was still turning ahead on reduced revolutions , so the pilot ordered port helm to 
stop the vessel  turning and steady the course to No.2 Reach.  The Hanjin Bombay  was 
reacting slowly to the helm , so the pilot requested the master to get the engine going as soon 
as he could , otherwise the vessel  was going to run aground.   
3.1.12.  At about 1958 the 'main  engine  automatic  shutdown ' alarm activated on the bridge and 
engine  room alarm panel s, and the engine stopped .  The pilot again requested the master to 
get the main  engine  on-line, and radioed the tugs to attend as quickly as possible.  
3.1.13.  At about 1959 the helmsman advised the pilot and master that the vessel was not responding 
to the helm .  The master then telephoned the engine  room and asked the chief engineer (in 
Korean) if he was able to start the main  engine . 
3.1.14.  At about 2000 the Hanjin Bombay  was approaching N orth West Rock light abeam to 
starboard .  The vessel was in the main channel moving at about 2.6 knots  on a heading of 
about 020 degrees gyro ; however,  with no main engine power the vessel 's bow was swing ing Figure 2

 to starboard at an increasing  rate.  At that point the master at the request of the pilot ordered 
the officer on the forecastle head  to drop the anchors .   
3.1.15.  About one minute later the pilot issued a broadcast on the radio that the Hanjin Bombay  was 
running aground  and requested the port radio operator to activate the port emergency 
response procedure .  By about 2002 the vessel's head ha d swung to about 060  degrees  gyro, 
so the pilot again requested the master to drop both anchors and asked what the status of the 
main  engine  was.  The master advised the pilot that the port anchor had been let go.  
3.1.16.  At about 2004 the Hanjin Bombay  ran aground on the Mount Maunganui side of the entrance 
channel , about  222 m north of North West Rock light .  
3.1.17.  As the vessel ran aground , the first officer on the forecastle head radioed the master to advise 
that he could hear air venting from the No. 1 port double -bottom water -ballast tank vent.   
Events in the engine room  
3.1.18.  At about 1920 'standby engines ' was rung from the navigating bridge on the engine room 
telegraph .  At that time  the engine room was manned by a total of five engineers, one more 
than the  company minimum of 4.  Present in the engine room and engine control room were 
the chief engineer, first engineer, second engineer, third engineer and engineer officer 
apprentice.  The engineers completed the final preparations for departure , which includ ed 
closing the steam valve to the main  engine  jacket -cooling -water pre-heater.   The function of 
the pre -heater was to warm the engine in preparation for use.  
3.1.19.  At about 1937 the first engine mov ement was recorded in the engine room .  The chief 
engineer was monitoring the temperature  of the main  engine  jacket -cooling -water  system .  He 
noted that it steadily increased from the 60 degree s Celsius (°C) that had been maintained by 
the main  engine pre -heater  to about the normal operating temperature of 80°C.  
3.1.20.  Between 1945 and about 1950 , as the Hanjin Bombay  was proceeding through the Cutter 
Channel , the chief engineer noticed that the temperature of the main  engine  jacket -cooling -
water  system was rising above the 'normal ' 80°C and had reached 82 °C.  The chief engineer 
told the first engineer  to check the main  engine  jacket -cooling -water  pumps and to vent any air 
out of the coolers.  
3.1.21.  At about 1949 the bridge team increased the main engine  from 'half-ahead ' to 'full-ahead '.   
3.1.22.  At about 1952 the chief engineer notic ed that the temperature of the main engine  jacket -
cooling -water  system was at 85 °C. The second engineer had just returned to the engine 
control room , so the chief engineer told him  to stay in the control room  while he  went to the 
main engine  jacket -cooling -water  coolers and checked the air vent himself.   He checked the 
main engine  jacket -cooling -water 3 -way temperature con trol valve  (3-way valve)  and found 
that it did not appear to be opening as it should .   
3.1.23.  The chief engineer lowered the temperature set point on the controller unit for the 3 -way 
valve , but this had no  effect.  The 3 -way valve was spring -loaded to 'normally open '.  Control 
air pressure acted on a diaphragm to push against the spring to close o r partially close the 
valve depending on the cooling -water temperature.  The chief engineer reduced the control air 
pressure to see if this would allow the valve to open - it did not.   
3.1.24.  The chief engineer returned to the engine control room to collect tool s to free the 3 -way valve . 
He returned  to the 3 -way valve , removed the pneumatic connection to it and hammered the 
side of the valve in an attempt to free it.  He noticed the valve starting to move.    
3.1.25.  Meanwhile the  cooling -water temperature had reached 90 °C, which initiated the main engine  
automatic  slowdown  function.  Shortly after this  the cooling -water temperature reached 95 °C, 
which initiated the main  engine  automatic  shutdown function , and the main engine  stopped.   
3.1.26.  The chief engineer had just succeeded in getting the 3 -way valve to move when he heard the 
general engine  room alarm sound and the sound of the main engine  revolutions de creasing , 

<< Page 8 >>
 Report 10 -204 so he went  back to the engine control room to f ind out what the alarm was for .  By the time he 
got to the control room the main engine  had already stopped.  He noted that the warning lights 
for main engine  slowdown  and shutdown  were illuminated , so he cancelled the alarms and 
telephoned the master on the navigating bridge.    
3.1.27.  The chief engineer said that in his telephone call to the master he advised the master that 
"everything was under control and could the master try to restart the main engine ".  This did 
not work , so the chief engineer advised the master to put the "engine telegraph to the 'stop' 
position to reset the system and then restart" . This did not work either .  The chief engineer 
noted at this time that the temperature of the main engine  jacket -cooling -water was 
registering 100 °C.   
3.1.28.  The chief engineer went to the 3 -way valve control unit to check that "everything was in order" , 
then returned to the engine control room to telephone the master.  However, by the time he 
returned to the engine control room the vessel had run aground.   
Post-accident events  
3.1.29.  The 2 tugs arrived soon after  the ves sel ran aground .  They were used  near the vessel 's stern 
to hold the vessel at right angles to the shoreline , against the force of the tidal current.  
3.1.30.  All other shipping movements were postponed while the port services dealt with the 
grounding .  A second harbour pilot boarded the vessel , then t he pilot vessel was used to check 
around the Hanjin Bombay  for any signs of pollution.  
3.1.31.  The master ordered the crew to emergency stations .  The crew made soundings of all tanks to 
check their integrity .  It was eventually established that only the port double -bottom ballast 
tank had been breached .   
3.1.32.  Low water was at 2130.  As the tide rose again the bow began to float.  The tugs were 
repositioned to hold the vessel  against the incoming tide and to assist in pulling the vessel off.  
3.1.33.  By about 2215 the Hanjin Bombay  was floating along its whole length.  The pilots manoeuvred 
the vessel back into the channel, using the incoming tide to push  the stern southwards and 
the bow heading out to sea.   The vessel  was then t aken  to anchor off the port for further 
assessment.   The following day, 22 June, the vessel was brought back into the port under its 
own power with assistance from the harbour tugs.   
3.2 Inspection and testing  
3.2.1  After berthing , the operator and classification s ociety arranged for an underwater inspection of 
the hull.  The classification society surveyor specified  that a temporary plate be welded over a 
penetration in the hull.  The penetration was approximately 1050 millimetres  (mm)  long by 
about 135 mm wide int o the No. 1 port double -bottom water -ballast tank.  After this repair  had 
been completed the Hanjin Bombay  sailed for Korea on 28 June 2012 , where it discharged its 
cargo then entered a dry -dock in China for permanent repairs.  Those repairs consisted of new 
steelwork inserted in the hull to repair several major indentations in the hull ranging between 
10 mm and 80 mm in depth,  and the replacement of  the internal structure of parts of N o. 2 
side girder, transverse web and floor p late.  The vessel left the dry -dock on 2 August for its 
next voyage.  
3.2.2  While the Hanjin Bombay  was in Mount Maunganui  the 3-way valve  was dismantled under the 
guidance of the Commission's investigator.  T he investigator also checked the relevant 
settings and  use of the cooling -water system , as well as the operation of the main engine  
control system , to establish why the engine had shut down.   
3.2.3  Nothing obvious could be found that would have caused the 3 -way valve to malfunction.  The 
full results of the 3 -way-valve inspection can be found in Appendix 1 . 
 
  
  
Report 10 -204 
<< Page 9 >>
 3.3 Recorders  
3.3.1  The Hanjin Bombay  was equipped with a simplified voyage data recorder, which is a device 
that collect s data from various sensors on -board a vessel.   The system digitises  and stores the 
information in a protective tamper -proof storage unit.  The stored data in the unit is volatile , 
which means  it is overwritten by new data after a period of  time.  The data can , however , be 
manually saved to the equipment's non -volatile mem ory, then later downloaded for analysis . 
3.3.2  After the incident the master of the Hanjin Bombay  saved the data for the previous 12 hours.  
This data was later downloaded by the Commission investigators.  The data was uncorrupted 
and proved useful for determini ng t he timing and sequence of events, as well as the 
conversations on the bridge .   
3.4 Vessel information  
3.4.1  The Hanjin Bombay  was a bulk carrier built in Korea in 1994/1995, owned by Kamco No.4 
Shipping Company S.A. of Panama, and operated by Hanjin  Shipping Company Limited of 
Korea.  The vessel was registered in Panama and had valid certificates issued by  the Korean 
Register of Shipping on behalf of the Panamanian Government.   
3.4.1  The Hanjin Bombay  had an overall length of 167 m and  a breadth of 26.2 m.  It had a summer 
draught (fully loaded) of 9.88 m , giving a total displacement of 3 3 509.9  tonnes.  At the time 
of the accident the mean draught was 9.86 m and the vessel was carrying about 26 268  
tonnes of logs.   
3.4.2  The Hanjin Bombay  was powered by a single B&W 5L50MC/HHIC direct -reversing diesel 
engine developing 7450  brake -horse power ( 5555 k ilowatts ), driving a single fixed -pitch 
propeller, giving a lo aded service speed of 14.14 knots.  It had a semi -balanced rudder fitted 
directly behind the propeller.  The vessel was not fitted with a bow thruster.  
3.4.3  The Hanjin Bombay  was fitted with the typical  suite of navigational equipment . 
3.5 Operation of the engine -cooling water system  
3.5.1  The main engine  on the Hanjin Bombay  was a water -cooled diesel  engine.  The main engine  
was kept at its optimum operating temperature using  a closed -loop fresh -water cooling system 
(see Figure 3).   
3.5.2  The fresh water could be passed through heat exchanger s (water coolers)  to remove heat that 
it pick ed up as it circulate d through the engine.  These water coolers  used, in this case,  sea 
water to remove the heat from the fresh  water.  The amount of fresh water from the closed -
loop system that was diverted through the water coolers  was controlled by the 3 -way valve.   
Simplistically speaking, the hotter the fresh  water became , the more of it would be diverted 
through the water coolers, to cool it.  
3.5.3  With reference to Figure 3, the 3 -way valve was in turn controlled by a temperature sensor (3) 
located in the re turn line of the cooling water from the main engine  (2).  The water was 
pumped around the system by the main engine  jacket -cooling -water pumps (5) and could , 
through the operation of the 3 -way valve , be sent through the main engine  jacket water 
coolers (4) .  Also located in the system after the 3 -way valve and before the main engine  was 
the jacket -cooling -water heater (6) , which when the main engine  was running was isolated 
from the system.  In the event of the system getting air or gas into it  from  either a leak or the 
water boiling , the de -aerating tank (7) would allow this to escape through the main engine  
fresh -water expansion tank (8).  
3.5.4  When the vessel was ready to depart the engineers would isolate the jacket -cooling -water 
heater .  The temperature sensor would send a signal through a pneumatic control unit to the 
3-way valve .  The valve would automatically open and close to regulate the cooling water 
temperature.  W hen the engine was not running the 3 -way valve would typically be closed.  
When the engine was running , the 3 -way valve  would open to varying degrees to regulate the

 flow of the fresh water through the water coolers to keep the fresh water at the optimum pre -
set temperature.  
3.5.5  If the temperature rose ab ove the pre-set value , the engine control system would sound an 
alarm to alert the engineers to the situation to allow them to take remedial action , and would 
automatically slow down the engine .  The alarm also sounded on the navigation bridge to wa rn 
the bridge team that there was a problem and that the engine was automatically slowing 
down.  If the temperature within the engine continued to climb and reached  another pre -set 
value , the engine control system would automatically shut  down  the main eng ine, usually by 
shutting off the fuel to the engine  (see Appendix 1 for details of the alarm settings) .  An alarm 
would alert both the engine room and bridge teams to t his automatic engine -shutdown  
condition.  
3.5.6  If the main engine  cooling water reached a temperature at which it boiled , large amounts of 
vapour or gas would be produced that would overwhelm the de -aerating system ; the engine 
would "gas up" and vapour would have to be bled off before normal cooling could be resumed.   
3.5.7  The chief engineer said later that the settings had been  set by the manufacturer to the 
company -recommended settings and that he had not altered them since he had been on 
board the vessel.   
3.6 Main engine  manoeuvring system  
3.6.1  The main engine  on the Hanjin Bomb ay could be controlled either directly from the side of the 
main engine  or electro -pneumatically from the control room or navigating bridge.  The main 
engine  side control would usually only be used if the other systems failed.  
3.6.2  The main engine  could only be  controlled from one of the control stations at a time .  This was 
usual ly the bridge when  the vessel  was being manoevred  under pilotage.  
3.6.3  The direction and speed of the main engine  were  controlled from the navigating bridge by a 
single telegraph transmitter with reversing, starting, stopping and speed regulation  controlled 
through a micro -computer unit.   The equipment also incorporated safety devices , including an 
engine safety system and a manual emergency shutdown  system using electro -pneumatic 
signals.  
3.6.4  The engine safety system would  automatically slow down the main engine  (for 10 instances) 
and if the fault was not corrected shut down the main engine  (for 5 instances).  The automatic 
slowdown  could  be overridden for all 10 instances and for 4 of  the 5 shutdown  instances.  
This was done by pushing a button on either the control room panel or the navigating bridge 
panel.  An automatic engine slowdown  or shutdown  due to  high cooling -water temperature 
was one of the instances that could  be overridden .  The engine safety system was designed to 
protect the engine from damage.  The override feature was provided in case the automatic 
slowdown  or loss of an engine was going to result in more serious damage and compromise 
the safety of the vessel  and crew.  
3.7 Environmental conditions  
3.7.1  Port of Tauranga Limited had numerous meteorological sensors around the port, which were 
used to produce a picture of the conditions within the port and out to "A" beacon.  The 
prevailing conditions at the time of the accident are shown  in Figure 4 , which for "A" beacon 
are wind from a west -south -westerly direction with a speed of about 19 knots, a significant 
wave  height of 1  m and a tidal height of 0.28 m.  The tidal stream in the entrance  channel was 
running at about 2  knots in a  northerly direction (ebbing).

 3.7.2  The predicted tides for Tauranga from the New Zealand Nautical Almanac (Government of 
New Zealand, 2009)  were:  
 Date  High Water  Low Water  High Water  Low Water  
Tauranga  21/06/2010  0203  1.9  m 0816  0.2  m 1440  1.8  m 2040  0.3  m 
3.7.3  From data supplied by Port of Tauranga Limited , low water occurred at "A" Beacon at about 
2100 and at the tug berth and Sulphur Point at about 2130.  The tidal stream in the entrance 
channel became slack at about 2215 , then commenced to flood.   
3.8 Personnel  information  
The Hanjin Bombay  
3.8.1  The master of the Hanjin Bombay  was a South Korean national and held a Panamanian 
master's certificate of competency issued on 11 December 2008 under the provisions of the 
International Convention on Standards of Training, Ce rtification and Watchkeeping for 
Seafarers, 1978 as amended in 1995  (STCW 1995) . This was a certificate of equivalent 
competency to his Korean certificate.  He had joined the Hanjin Bombay  on 22 September 
2009 as master.   
3.8.2  The third officer of the Hanjin B ombay  was a n Indonesian national and held a Panamanian 
certificate of competency as a navigational watchkeeping officer issued under the provisions 
of STCW 1995 .  This was a certificate of equivalent competency to his Indonesian certificate.  
He had joined  the vessel on 25 December 2009 as third officer.   
3.8.3  The helmsman of the Hanjin Bombay  was an Indonesian national and had signed on  to the 
vessel as quartermaster on 4 May 2010.   
3.8.4  The chief engineer of the Hanjin Bombay  was a Korean national and held a Panamanian chief 
engineer's certificate of competency issued on 11 December 2008 under the provisions of 
STCW 1995 .  This was a certificate of equivalent competency to his Korean certificate.  He 
had joined the Hanjin Bomb ay on 4 September 2009 as chief engineer.   
Port of Tauranga Limited  
3.8.5  The pilot on board the Hanjin Bombay  was a New Zealand national and held a New Zealand 
certificate of competency as a master issued under the provisions of STCW 1995 .  He had 
been a pilot  in Tauranga for about 18 months and was licen sed as a Grade "B" pilot.  As a 
Grade "B" pilot he was limited to piloting vessels up to a length  of 210 m overall and up to a 
draught of 11.7 m.    
3.9 Organisational and management information  
3.9.1  In 1993 the Internat ional Maritime Organization adopted the International Management Code 
for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code); and in 1998 the ISM  
Code became mandatory.  The ISM Code established safety management objectives and 
required a safety management system to be established by the operating company .  The 
procedures required by the ISM Code  were to be documented and compiled in a safety 
management manual, a copy of which was to be kept on board.   
3.9.2  Under the ISM Code the operating comp any is required to designate a working language for 
use on the vessel so that the crew can communicate effectively at work. The chosen working 
language on board the Hanjin Bombay  was English.  
3.9.3  On 18 May 2009  Hanjin Ship Management Company Limited, the opera tor of the Hanjin 
Bombay , was audited by the Korean R egister  under the authority of the Government of the 
Republic of Panama and was found to comply with the requirements of the ISM Code.  The 
operator  was issued with a document of compliance .  The first annual verification was due to 
take place between 15 April and 15 October 2010 .  
 

<< Page 14 >>
 Report 10 -204 3.9.4  The Hanjin Bombay  had been similarly audited and the vessel's safety management system 
had been found to comply with the requirements of the ISM Code.  The vessel had been  
issued with a safety management certificate on 10 August 200 9, which remained valid, 
subject to periodic verification s, until 30 May 2011.   
3.9.5  Port State Control is the inspection of foreign vessels in national ports to verify that the 
condition of the vessels and their equipment compl ies with the requirements of international 
regulations and that the vessels are manned and operated in compliance with those 
regulations .  The primary responsibility for vessel standards rests with the Flag State - but 
Port State Control provides a "safety net" to catch substandard vessels.   
3.9.6  Maritime N ew Zealand , as the regulator and as New Zealand's International Maritime 
Organization representative , inspects 90% of all eligible foreign vessels during their time spent 
in New Zealand ports (under section 54 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994 ).   
3.9.7  On 14 June , about one week before  the grounding , the Hanjin Bombay  was inspected by a 
Maritime New Zealand Port State Control officer  at Marsden Point .  One deficiency with 
mooring arrangements  was recorded , which was to be assessed by the classification society  
on the vessel's return to Korea .  Under the Asia Pacific Memorandum of Understanding on  the 
Port State Control Targeting Scheme , the Hanjin Bombay  had a target factor  of 20, which was 
considered medium  risk, where 0 -9 was low risk, 10 -29 was medium risk and 30+ was high 
risk.  The Hanjin Bombay  had never been detained for any deficiencies under Port State 
Control.   
Port of Tauranga Limited  
3.9.8  The procedures for piloting vessels into and out of the port of Tauranga by pilots were 
contained in Port of Tauranga  Limited's  Piloting Procedures booklet.  They comprised , 
amongst other s, the following:  
This manual contains information relating to piloting at the Port of Tauranga.  
Procedures are listed and information made available through attachments to 
allow pilots to make measured and informed decisions. This should not, 
however, be taken to mean that this document deals comprehensively with all 
of the concerns which will need to be addressed.  It is not the intention of this 
document to take decision -making away from a pilot.  
3.9.9  The New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code  was published in August 2004.  Its 
objective was to provide for the safe management of vessels in port s and harbours, including 
preventing serious harm to people and protecting the environment and property.   
3.9.10  The Code was developed following a number of serious accidents involving large vessels in the 
approaches to and within New Zealand harbours in 2002 -03.  Investigations revealed a need 
for more rigour and consistency in the standard of safety management of New Zealand ports 
and harbours.   
3.9.11  The Code was prepared by Maritime New Zealand  in consultation with industry stakeholders .  
The Code identified the duties and powers under existing legislation of those involved in port 
and harbour safety.  The Code was voluntary and recommended that regional councils, as the 
principal local regulators of navigational safety, undertake risk assessments and develop 
safety management systems for the harbours in their regions.  Maritime New Zealand  
provided advice to councils on these tasks and approved the completed assessments and 
safety management plans.   
3.9.12  The Code was supported by a series of guidelines to good practic e, of which one was the 
Guidelines for Port & Harbour Risk Assessment and Safety Management Systems in New 
Zealand.  Bay of Plenty Regional Council and Port of Tauranga Limited jointly employed an 
outside marine consultancy firm specialising in marine risk  assessment, risk management and 
vessel traffic surveys to conduct the navigational risk assessment in accordance with the 
requirements of the Code.   
  
Report 10 -204 
<< Page 15 >>
 3.9.13  The results of the navigational risk assessment were presented to Bay of Plenty Regional 
Council  and Port  of Tauranga Limited in June 2007.  The assessment identified 73 hazards at 
the overview level, which were ranked according to risk.  Of these 73 hazards, 18 referred to 
groundings .  Of the 18 grounding  hazards, 3 referred to the possibility of a grounding  in the  
entrance channel or N o. 2 R each.   All 3 references were concerned with vessels entering the 
port rather than departing .  Total loss of propulsion  was not considered .   
3.9.14  New risk -control recommendations for 2 of the grounding scenarios suggested introducing 
requirements to meet specified vessels with tugs at an agreed location.    
3.10 Previous and subsequent occurrences  
The Caribic  
3.10.1  On 7 May 2000 the refrigerated cargo carrier Caribic  was departing the port of Tauranga when 
it ran aground between Mou nt Maunganui and Tanea No.2 Buoy (Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission, 2000) .   
3.10.2  In the findings of the report the Commission found that:  
 the resources available on the navigating bridge  of the Caribic  at the time of the ac cident 
did not allow the principles of good crew resource management to function properly  
 the Caribic  had a known tendency to initially react slowly to applied rudder before 
establishing a fast rate of turn.  That tendency was not noted on the pilot infor mation card 
nor was it adequately conveyed to the pilot  
 the turn had been initiated by the application of 10 degrees of starboard rudder and 
became greater than the pilot had estimated.  He took corrective action, but the 
application of counter helm in sma ll increments, given the slow initial reaction time of the 
vessel, was not sufficient to avoid the grounding  
 the slow reaction of the Caribic  to counter rudder once swinging to starboard, together with 
the faulty movement of the rudder indicator , led the p ilot to believe that the steering gear 
was not moving the rudder to port.  The possibility of an intermittent malfunction of the 
steering gear that was not evident in subsequent testing could not be discounted .   
The Schelde  Trader  
3.10.3  This occurrence was not investigated by the Commission , but Port of Tauranga Limited 
provided information from its investigation into the occurrence.   
3.10.4  On 28 October 2011 the general cargo vessel  Schelde Trader  was departing the port of 
Tauranga.  As the vessel was negotiating th e bend from the Cutter Channel into No.2 Reach 
the oil mist detector in the crankcase of the main engine  activated , which triggered an 
automatic engine shutdown.   
3.10.5  The Schelde Trader  was executing a turn to starboard at the time of the automatic engine 
shutdown.  With the main engine  and propeller stopped there was not enough water flow over 
the rudder to stop the vessel's swing to starboard , despite the rudder being put hard over to 
port.  
3.10.6  The pilot and the master of the Schelde Trader  ordered the port anch or to be dropped but  
there was a delay in dropping the anchor.   The vessel grounded before the anchor was 
dropped, approximately 100 m to the north of the position where the Hanjin Bombay  
grounded.

 Report 10 -204 4. Analysis  
4.1 General  
4.1.1  The Hanjin Bombay  was about 15 years old at the time of the grounding.  It was classed as a 
medium -risk vessel as  far as the Port State Control s ystem was concerned, primarily because 
of the deficiencies attributed to the vessel , although  none of those deficiencies was serious 
enough for it to be detain ed.  The safety management system s for the operating company and 
the vessel  were current, and the vessel  was crewed in accordance with the international and 
national standards of the day.  
4.1.2  Vessel s' machinery installations a nd their control systems are complex, and regardless of how 
well maintained they are there will always remain the possibility that some part fail s for some 
reason.  Vessel s like the Hanjin Bombay  are designed fundamentally for long sea voyages , 
with only a  small percentage of their time spent manoeuvring around ports and enclosed 
waters.  Consequently they often have only one main propulsion engine , for econom y.  Such 
vessel s rely  on harbour tugs to provide redundancy while assisting them into and out of po rts.  
Harbour pilots provide a link between the vessel s and the tugs and other port services.  
4.1.3  It is important that the safety systems for a vessel  and for a port company  are aligned in their 
recognition of the risks involved when the vessel  enters and leav es the port or harbour .  The 
respective safety systems  must be robust  and communication between vessel  and port needs  
to be good  before a  pilotage passage  plan is agreed .  This is  because every vessel  is different  
and handles differently . 
4.1.4  The following analysis discusses what caused the Hanjin Bombay 's main engine to stop; the 
technical reasons why it ran aground; the robustness of the safety system  for the port, 
particularly regarding risk ; and communication issues within the bridge team a nd between the 
bridge team and the engine room.  
4.2 Why the engine stopped  
4.2.1  It is clear from the engine alarm data and the observations of the chief engineer that the 
engine automatically slowed down then automatically shut down due to rising cooling -water 
temp erature.  The engine protection system automatically shut down the engine, as it was 
designed to do in order to protect the engine from serious damage.  The reason for the rising 
cooling -water temperature could not be conclusively established because when the 3 -way 
valve was later dismantled, it was found to be in good condition.  
4.2.2  Four possibilities have been considered.  The first is that the temperature sensor may have 
been faulty, but this was unlikely because the engineers observed the temperature steadi ly 
rising on the monitor in the engine room.  It was not performing erratically.  
4.2.3  The second possibility  was that the 3 -way valve controller may not have been receiving the 
signal from the temperature sensor.  This too is unlikely because when the cooling w ater 
temperature increases the control system decreases the control air pressure to the control 
diaphragm, which would normally allow the spring to open the valve to the coolers.  When the 
chief engineer removed the control air connection from the valve th is should have overridden 
the automatic control unit and allowed the spring to open  the valve , but it didn't.  
4.2.4  The third possibility  is that the spring that normally opened the valve was faulty, but it was 
found in good condition with no signs of corrosion.  
4.2.5  The fourth possibility  is that the  valve stem became temporarily jammed with debris such as 
detritus.  Evidence of detritus was not found jammed around the valve spindle, but detritus 
was found in the cooling water system (see figures A1 -2 and A1 -3).  The  chief engineer 
succeeded in starting to move the valve by hammering on the valve casing.  This would 
indicate that something was jamming the valve.  By the time the valve was dismantled for 
inspection, it had been operating to cool the main engine when it was used to re -float the  
vessel , to take the vessel  out to the anchorage and then to re-ente r the port again .  Any debris 
lodged around the valve spindle would not necessarily  have  remain ed there , which could 
  
Report 10 -204 
<< Page 17 >>
 explain why the valve spindle was found in a clean condition when the valve was dismantled 
for inspection . 
4.2.6  The Commission therefore considers that the most likely reason for the overheating of the 
cooling -water system was a malfunction of the 3 -way valve, and that the most likely reason for 
this was that it could not operate due to debris in the cooling water becoming lodged around 
the valve spindle.  
4.3 Loss of control  
4.3.1  The Hanjin Bombay  was heavily loaded with logs when it departed No.10 berth.  A heavily 
laden vessel  is generally slower to respond to ch anges in speed and direction  than an empty 
vessel .  It will take longer to gain speed under engine power, and will take longer to slow down 
when engine power is reduced.  Larger rudder angles will be needed to begin the vessel  
turning, and again when tryin g to slow or stop the rate of turn.  
4.3.2  Once the Hanjin Bombay  had been turned and lined up with the channel, the need for tug 
assistance was reduced, provided the vessel  propulsion and steering systems remain ed 
operative.   Vessel s with fine underwater lines  (container and passenger vessels)  will generally 
be more directionally stable  than others .  Bulk carriers like the Hanjin Bombay  are generally 
wider , with a more box -shaped underwater profile.  These types of vessel  are not generally so 
directionally stabl e.  This means that more control is required to keep them  going in a straight 
line. 
4.3.3  The rudder is aerofoil shaped.  When it is turned the water flowing past it creates 'lift' on one 
side, like an aeroplane wing.  That lift pushes the stern of the vessel  sideways and the stern 
rotates around the pivot point , which  is near the bow of the vessel  when it is moving ahead.  In 
this way the vessel  is steered.  The faster the water flowing past the rudder, the more lift is 
produced and the better the vessel  steers.  The water flowing past the rudder is governed by 2 
things: the speed of the vessel  through the water ; and the additional flow created by the 
propeller.  At higher water  speed s the speed of the vessel  through th e water plays a greater 
role.  When a vessel is accelerating the propeller wash has a greater effect until the speed of 
the vessel  builds  up.  Momentarily increasing engine speed will  therefore  give the pilot more 
steering control.  Decreasing the engine speed will result in less control for the pilot.  
4.3.4  If the body of water through which the vessel  is moving is also moving, the pilot will need to 
take this into account, particularly when navigating narrow channels.  The speed of the vessel  
through the water will need to be proportionally higher , otherwise the current can have too 
much influence on the vessel 's path.  
4.3.5  At the time of the Hanjin Bombay 's departure the tide was still ebbing at 2 knots in the 
channel, which means the vessel  was running with a 2 -knot current.  In order for the pilot to 
better control the planned  track of the vessel  as it entered the narrow channel, he needed to 
have a reasonably high water speed, and he was attempting to achieve this by building up the 
speed rapidly with the successive 'half' then 'full' engine speed s. 
4.3.6  Figure 5 shows the progress of the Hanjin Bombay  as the events unfolded.  When the chief 
engineer first noted that the cooling -water temperature had risen above normal  (82°C), the 
tugs were still in attendance .  By the time the temperature had risen to 85 °C the tugs were 
returning to their berth, less than half a nautical mile away.  A precautionary phone call to the 
bridge at that time could have allowed the tugs to be back in attendance .  It also  could have 
delayed the 'full -ahead' engine movement from th e bridge , which would have slowed the rise 
in cooling -water temperature  and given  the engineers more time to resolve the issue before 
the engine shut down.  
4.3.7  As it was, the pilot was not told of the engine auto -slowdown event and he went ahead and 
initiated the turn into No. 2 Reach oblivious to the fact that th e engine had slowed down.  He 
soon noticed the unresponsiveness of the vessel  to his helm orders and began questioning 
the captain on why the engine had slowed down.  The reason for the poor response t o the 
rudder movements was the reduced propeller wash past the rudder.  Depending on the speed 
through the water  that the vessel  had reached, it is feasible that the propeller at 'dead-slow 
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Report 10 -204 ahead ' revolutions was disrupting the water flow past the rudder being created by the vessel 's 
speed through the water.  
4.3.8  When the engine shut down altogether, the vessel  was still turning to starboard.  Without any 
propeller wash past the rudder, there was not enough lift generated by it to arrest the turn.  To 
exacerbate the situation, once the bow began to leave the channel and out of the influence of 
the following curr ent, the current pushing on the stern of the vessel  would have accentuated 
the swing to starboard.  Without the engine or the use of tugs , the grounding at that point was 
probably inevitable.  
4.3.9  There was a way that the use of the main engine could have been prolonged.  The automatic 
slowdown  and subsequent shutdown  of the main engine were  feature s of the engine safety 
system , designed to prevent damage to the main engine from  overheating.  Both events could 
have been overridden by the master on the bridge if the circumstances had permitted, simply 
by pushing the override button on the engine control console.   This button was flashing at the 
time, which was a cue to the master that the override function was available to him . 
4.3.10  An override feature is installed to allow  the master to weigh  up his options to achieve  the least 
unfavourable outcome  in such a situation .  Overrid ing an engine safety system could have 
caused overheating damage to the main engine, but overrid ing it for just long enough to 
enable the pilot to steady the course of the vessel  in the channel could have prevented the 
grounding.   The tugs at that point were close to arriving and could have been used to keep 
control of the vessel  until the main engine was available again.   With the 3 -way valve 
beginning to function again, restoring main engine power could have occurred very soon after 
it had been lost.  
4.3.11  It was unclear whether the master understood the function of the overrid e button.  When the 
auto -slowdown alarm activated, he asked the chief engine er on the phone whether he should 
reduce the engine speed.  This would suggest  that he was not aware that this was already 
happening automatically.  Overrid ing a safety system is not a decision to be taken lightly.  The 
master should be fully conversant wi th the system and the ramifications of using it .  However, 
the consequences of a vessel  running aground can be serious.  Apart from the disruption to 
service and  the cost of repair, the potential for environmental damage must be considered, as 
should the disruption to port services.  
4.3.12  Alternatively, h ad the entire bridge team been in the loop and an early assumption been made 
that no engine power was going to be availab le, it is possible that  the immediate deployment 
of both anchors would have alleviated the force of the grounding, or even prevented it (but 
that is purely speculation ). 
4.3.13  The short time it took for control of the Hanjin Bombay  to be lost highlights the risk s of 
mechanical failure for port operations. It also highlights the importance of good 
communication between all parties whose actions can affect the progress of a vessel .  These 
matters are discussed more fully in the following sections.  
Findings:  
The aut omatic main engine slowdown  and shutdown  events were caused by high 
cooling -water temperature, which was most likely caused by a malfunction of a 3 -way 
valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water.  
The Hanjin Bombay 's main engine automatical ly shut down after the vessel  was 
established in a turn into No.2 Reach, which left the vessel  with insufficient steering 
control to overcome the momentum of the turn and prevent it leaving the channel and 
grounding.  
The facility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to overrid e 
the automatic main engine shutdown , which might have resulted in damage to the 
main engine but probably would have prevented the vessel  running aground.  
  
Report 10 -204

Better communication about the developing situation within the bridge team and 
between the bridge and engine room could have prevented the Hanjin Bombay  
grounding through the better use of engines, tugs and anchors.

 4.4 Crew resource management  
4.4.1  Crew resource management is the term used to describe the co-ordination of all skills and 
resources available to a vessel's crew to achieve the established goal of optimum safety and 
efficiency1.   
4.4.2  The use of crew resource management helps  to eliminate the potential for one -person error s 
to result in an accident , and it aids the flow of information between anyone whose actions can 
affect the progress of the vessel .  This is not just limited to bridge personnel, but includes the 
engine room and other deck crew, tugs and shore -based information services .   
4.4.3  When used effectively, crew resource management ensures that all the vessel's crew : share a 
common view of the intended passage ; maintain situational awareness ; anticipate dangerous 
situations ; acquire all relevant information and act upon it in a timely manner ; avoid an error 
chain being formed ; and avoid preoccupation with minor proble ms. 
4.4.4  When crew resource management is working effectively , the pilot join ing the vessel is 
incorporated into the navigating bridge  team and an exchange of relevant information takes 
place .  This is usually in the form of a pre -departure briefing on the pilo tage passage plan .  It is 
industry best practice that t he entire bridge team take part in this briefing so that they all 
understand the plan.  This did not happen on the Hanjin Bombay .  The exchange was between 
the master and pilot only.  This fact was reflected in the performance of the bridge team as 
events unfolded.  The officer of the watch had virtually no involvement in managing the 
situation  as it escalated .  The master was acting alone, even to the exclusion of involving the 
pilot.  His discussions with the chief engineer were in Korean, which no -one else on the bridge 
understood.   The pilot asked the master for information several times, but did not get any 
response other than to be told when one of the anchors had been let go just before the vessel  
ran aground.  
4.4.5  Under the ISM Code the working language of the sh ip had been declared as English.  The use 
of a common working language is critical to the safe operation of a vessel .  This is especially 
important when dealing with emergencies.  On this occasion the master's discussions with the 
chief engineer being in the Korean language meant that the pilot and other bridge team 
members could not understand the problem they were dealing wi th.  This was then 
exacerbated by the master's failure to then inform the bridge team what that problem was.   
4.4.6  Vessel s are totally reliant on the engineering systems for the safe transit of enclosed waters.  
It is important that engine room crew are fully aware  of the situation during pilotage 
operations and vice versa, but so often this does not happen.  Engine control rooms are 
usually located  down in the engine room where the crew cannot see where the vessel  is and 
what is happening to it .  Naturally the n, engine room crew can become 'immersed ' in their own 
environment, focused solely on the performance of the machinery, and unaware of the overall 
situation . 
4.4.7  Fitting d uplicate chart plotter screens in engine control rooms is one initiative that can help 
engine room crew maintain awareness of the vessel 's location .  This knowledge can help 
engine room crew  to balance their response to resolve technical problems with the need to 
communicate with the bridge.  Using this accident as an example, the c hief engineer was 
aware that he had an escalating cooling -water problem.  He had 4 other engineers at his 
disposal , yet none was dedicated to bridge communications .  Had he been aware, at a glance, 
where the vessel  was in the channel, he could have  surmise d that it was not a good time to 
have main engine problems , warned the bridge team early enough for them to alter  their plan , 
and prevented the grounding.   There would even have been  some benefit in someone from 
the engine room taking part in the passage  plan briefing  on the bridge . 
4.4.8  Even after the captain and chief engineer started conversing in the Korean language on the 
phone, the master did not provide the pilot, who was controlling the vessel , with sufficient 
information for him to respond accordingly.

 Report 10 -204 4.4.9  The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay  fell well short of 
best industry practice.  Crew resource management training is an important part of training 
required under STCW 1995 .  This inquiry did not look as far back as  the training standards for 
the individual crew members involved in this accident, so it could not be determined whether 
the issue lay with just these individuals or whether there is a wider systemic training issue.  
However, the operating company does hav e a responsibility to ensure that the vessel  is run 
safely, which includes ensuring that navigational practices and techniques as a minimum 
comply with the International Maritime Organization  and Flag State standards .  This is a 
requirement of any safety m anagement system .  The safe vessel  management system  for the 
operating company and the Hanjin Bombay  clearly did not achieve those standards on this 
occasion.  
Findings:  
The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay  fell well 
short of internat ional industry best practice.  
A better standard of crew resource management could have prevented the grounding 
in spite of the main engine cooling -water problem.  
Navigation practices (including crew resource management) are a critical shipboard 
function that any safety management system should closely monitor to ensure that 
best industry practice is achieved.  
The safety management system for the Hanjin Bombay  and its operating company did 
not succeed in ensuring  that good crew resource management was a standard feature 
of on -board operations.  
The master not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging 
with the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency 
management protocols that left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware of 
the issue they were dealing with.  This breach contributed to the Hanjin Bombay  
grounding.  
 
4.5 Port risk assessment  - tug escort  
4.5.1  Port of Tauranga  Limited's  risk assessment identified 73 potential hazards, of which 18 were 
grounding events, and of these 18 three  were grounding events in the entrance channel 
outside No. 2 Reach.  Surprisingly , these 3 hazards referred to inbound vessel s only, in spite 
of there having been 2 gr oundings of vessels during outbound passages, one (the Schelde 
Trader ) under  similar circumstances  to this grounding and in almost the same location.  
4.5.2  Since this grounding Port of Tauranga Limited has reviewed its operating procedures around 
the use of tug escorts.  See Section 6 for full details.  The review list s a number of factors for 
pilots to consider when deciding if a tug escort is to be used.  However, t ransposing the Hanjin 
Bombay 's departure into the revised model, the pilot would not have been  likely to use a tug 
escort for any longer  than he did on this occasion.  Referring to the criteria used  in the model , 
the Hanjin Bombay  was less than 25 years old, had a standard single -propeller/single -rudder 
configuration  and had no history of mechanical failure ; and no maintenance had been 
conducted on the machinery in port prior to departure  - yet it encountered a mechanical 
problem on the outward journey that ultimately led to the grounding.  
4.5.3  Earlier in this report we referred to the complexity of  vessel  machinery  installations  and their  
control systems .  Using risk assessment methodology  the likelihood of a malfunction of some 
sort is high, even with well  maintained vessels.   The data  for reported occurrences of 
mechanical failure during pilotage in New Zealand alone show s this to be the case.   
Information supplied by Maritime New Zealand showed that in the 30 months from 24 January 
  
Report 10 -204 
<< Page 23 >>
 2010  there had been 30  reported  instances of machinery or equipment failure on vessels in 
the pilotage waters of New Zealand  ports.    
4.5.4  For a vessel  like the Hanjin Bombay  that has only one propulsion system, the risk of losing 
control of the vessel  caused by  a single -point failure is higher than that for other vessel s that 
have  greater level s of redundancy built in  to their propulsion and power -management systems .  
This grounding was a relatively low -consequence event, although from the vessel  operator's 
perspective there was some considerable expense in terms of repair costs and disruption s to 
service.  From the port company 's perspective there was the disruption to shipping services 
for one  tidal window of operation.   
4.5.5  The eastern side of No. 2 Reach is a rocky shoreline, and this seems to be  the shoreline where 
ships are going to ground if propulsion is lost when making the  turn into No. 2 Reach.  The 
consequence s of any future grounding in this area have  the potential to be much worse.  Port 
of Tauranga Limited would be advised to reconsider its long -term strategy for the use of escort 
tugs if the risk is to be reduced to a s low as reasonably practicable.  The Commission 
recommends that the port company address this safety issue  and that Maritime New Zealand 
consider this issue when approving or auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management systems .   
4.5.6  Port of Tauranga Limited has developed within its safety management system a 'history' 
database for vessel s that have experienced technical malfunctions during Port of Tauranga 
transits.  The system has merit.  Such a system would have even more benefit if it was 
adopted on a national basis.  Many vessel s transit several New Zealand ports during a round 
trip.  Information on p roblems experienced in one port should be pas sed on to other ports so 
that the risk s can be appropriately mitigated there.  Such a database need not be restricted to 
mechanical issues.  A standard of crew resource management is another piece of useful 
information for a pilot planning for a vessel  arrival or departure.  Minor technical defects and 
human performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on 
board a vessel.  Maritime New Zealand could use such a database to help focus its resources 
for best effect from a Port State Control perspective.  A recommendation has been made to 
the Director of Maritime New Zealand to consider this safety issue.  
  
Findings:  
The grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a 
passive or active escort role.  
Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety 
Management System did not fully address the risk of departing vessel s experiencing 
failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance 
channel.  
If the issue s of mechanically unreliable vessel s and substandard crew resource 
management on vessel s operating in New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will 
need to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues 
as they  arise.

 Report 10 -204 5. Findings  
5.1. The automatic main engine slowdown  and shutdown  events were caused by high cooling -
water temperature, which was most likely caused by the malfunction of a 3 -way valve used to 
regulate the temperature of the cooling water.  
5.2. The Hanjin  Bombay 's main engine automatically shut down after the vessel  was established in 
a turn into No.2 Reach, which left the vessel  with insufficient steering control to overcome the 
momentum of the turn and prevent it leaving the channel and grounding.  
5.3. The fa cility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to overrid e the 
automatic main engine shutdown, which might have resulted in damage to the main engine 
but probably would have prevented the vessel  running aground.  
5.4. Better communication  about the developing situation within the bridge team and between the 
bridge and engine room could have prevented the Hanjin Bombay  grounding through the 
better use of engines, tugs and anchors.  
5.5. The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin  Bombay  fell well short of 
international industry best practice.  
5.6. A better standard of crew resource management could have prevented the grounding in spite 
of the main engine cooling -water problem.  
5.7. Navigation practices (including crew resource management) are a critical shipboard function 
that any safety management system should closely monitor to ensure  that best industry 
practice is achieved.  
5.8. The safety management system for the Hanjin Bombay  and its operating company did not 
succeed in ensuring that good  crew resource management was a standard feature of on -
board operations.  
5.9. The master not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging with 
the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency 
management p rotocols that left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware of the 
issue they were dealing with.  This breach contributed to the Hanjin Bombay  grounding.  
5.10.  The grounding could  have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive 
or active escort role.  
5.11.  Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management 
system did not fully address the risk of departing vessel s experiencing failure of propulsion 
and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the  entrance channel.  
5.12.  If the issue s of mechanically unreliable vessel s and substandard crew resource management 
on vessel s operating in New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need to be done at a 
national level rather than individual ports dealing w ith the issues as they arise.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  address ing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Since the accident Port of Tauranga Limited  has reviewed its Pilot's Standard Operating 
Procedures and a section has been inserted that covers the objectives, considerations and 
general information on escort t owing as shown below : 
Tug Escorting  Objectives  
 To reduc e the risk of pollution in the p ort of Tauranga approaches due to groundings or 
collisions caused by technical or human failures on board a vessel.  
 To apply steering and braking forces to a disabled vessel using escorting tugs to limit the 
impact of collision or grounding.  
 Provide tug assistance to vessel s with limited manoeuvrability . 
Tug Escort Considerations  
Factors to be considered in determining a tug escort requirement may include but [are] not limited 
to: 
 Vessel history (e.g. previous piloting experience, advised engineering deficiencies, first time 
port call, etc)  
 Age of vessel (e.g. a vessel more than 25 years old)  
 Manoeuvrability characteristics (e.g. twin -screw/single rudder, directional sta bility, etc .) 
 Vessel length, draft and under -keel clearance (e.g. deep draft coal vessel ) 
 Visibility (e.g. reduced or chance of reduced visibility during pilotage)  
 Wind (e.g. high sided vessel)  
 Tide and current  
The pilot should check the Harbour Managemen t System for a vessel's history remarks during 
passage planning.  
Following a pilotage, the pilot should update the vessel's history remarks if required.  
Vessel Speed when Escorting  
A vessel being  escorted should proceed at a speed appropriate to the prevailing operational 
circumstances and the tug's capabilities.  
The pilot should  consider:  
 The ability of the tugs to overtake the escorted vessel in an emergency.  
 The requirement  for the safe handl ing of the tugs around the escorted vessel.  
 The vessel's speed through the water determines the escort tug's effectiveness and not 
speed over ground.  
Tug Availability and Tug Standby  
Tugs are on standby at the tug berth 30 minutes prior to a vessel movem ent. 
Pilots should  consider the tugs ' response time from the standby position to the time when the tugs 
could be effective. Tug line securing time should also be considered.  
Pilots should  also consider other shipping movements and tug escort requirements when passage 
planning.  
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Report 10 -204  Inbound Vessels  
Prior to, or when passing 'A' Beacon, the pilot will pass the instruction via [very high frequency] VHF 
CH 12 for the tugs ' rendezvous position if required, e.g. "Tugs standby at Tanea".  
 Outbound Vessels  
The pilot will ask the tugs to continue standby with an instruction "to monitor VHF Channel 12 until 
clear" and/or to "follow the vessel to a nominated position".  
Tug Escorting Modes  
During  passage planning or as determined by the Pilot/Master exchange, the pilot may determine 
if a passive (no line) or an active (secure line) tug escort(s) precaution is required.  
 Passive  Escorting  
No line secured  and the tug(s) escorts the vessel as required  by the pilot.  
Tugs are placed  in a standby position for immediate use in the event of an emergency 
onboard the escorted vessel and where the escort tug is required to provide assistance.  
 Active Escorting  
The tug's line is secured to the vessel centre -lead aft or as required by the pilot.  
A tug used for active escorting may be used to:  
 Take the way off a vessel  
 Turn a vessel  
 Counter a steering sheer  
When  using tugs for active escorting, the tug s' characteristics must be taken into consideration.  
Further  guidance can be found in "Tug Use in Port" by Captain Henk Hensen, FNI. The Nautical 
Institute. Second Edition. Chapter 9.  
Vessel Maintenance Declaration  
Due to the increased risk of vessel breakdown after Main -engine  and/ or Critical Auxiliary System 
maintenance vessels are required to complete a Vessel Maintenance Declaration prior to work 
being undertaken . The purpose of these declarations is to allow planning to be undertaken early by 
the Pilot before he/she boards the vessel.  
Vessel Maintenance  Declarations will be emailed to the CSC.  Pilots shall undertake a risk 
assessment with regard to the work carried out. Risk mitigating measures must be considered 
and carried out as required. These measures may include  
 Re-grading  vessel i.e. making it an  "A" departure  
 Ensuring  anchors are immediately ready for letting go and anchor parties fully briefed 
and on standby  
 Piloting  the vessel at the end of mul tiple vessel  movements to ensure t ugs can be 
available if required  
 Engaging  active or passive t ug esco rting  
6.3. Since the accident Port of Tauranga Limited  has begun to use the Ship Model Simulator at 
Port Ash in Australia for pilot training.  Port Ash is a manned model simulator. This means that 
scaled models are used in a scaled pond to simulate life -sized v essels and their manoeuvring 
characteristics. A particular strength of this type of simulation is the ability to execute 
anchoring manoeuvres. This means that Port of Tauranga Limited 's pilots have the opportunity 
to practi se emergency anchoring procedures  and experience how vessels will react in these 
situations. Port Ash focuses on the use of anchors in much of its training and pilots come 
away from these courses with a heightened understanding and awareness of anchor use.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand , with notice of these recommendations given to [insert organisations].  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. On  22 March 2013  the Commission made the following recommendation s to the Director of 
Maritime New Zealand:  
7.4. The number of defects that are causing incidents and accide nts in New Zealand pilotage 
waters is of concern.  It is an indication that New Zealand port and harbour authorities cannot 
totally rely on the Interna tional Safety Management system  to ensure that vessel s transiting 
New Zealand ports are  operated  safely a nd efficiently.  Minor technical defects and human 
performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on board a 
vessel.   If the issue s of mechanically unreliable vessel s and substandard crew resource 
management on vessel s operat ing into New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need 
to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues as they arise.  
The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and 
harbour a uthorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal 
system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel  defects and crew 
performance issues.  The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately 
availa ble to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage 
operations at subsequent ports.  The purpose of the system should not be to replace the 
mandatory reporting of a ccidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in 
a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.  (004/13 ) 
On 23 April 2013, the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand replied:  
Maritime New Zealand has previously commented on the distribution of inciden t 
and accident notifications, and also on the monthly summaries, which are now 
posted on the Maritime New Zealand public website.  TAIC was perhaps 
envisaging an arrangement whereby a pilot in one port who has a concern about 
a ship or becomes aware of an incident can immediately pass that information 
on to pilots and MNZ personnel at the next port of call so that appropriate action 
can be taken.  Martime New Zealand understands that this is what already 
happens routinely and considers there is no need to f ormalise it.  Maritime New 
Zealand's previous comment on this recommendations is set out below, and is 
reiterated in light of the above recommendation:  
MNZ has online report system in place - this facilitates the notification of 
information including vessel defects and crew performance issues.  Te recent 
shift to a regional structure and the development of an intelligence and planning 
team has resulted in  a more timely response to any information received.  
Furthermore, notifications received by MNZ are forwarded to the appropriate 
harbourmaster for their information as well as a monthly summary of all 
notifications.  It is intended that these monthly summ aries will in future be 
posted on MNZ's website making them more readily availably to Pilots, [this is 
now the case]  Harbourmasters, Port Companies and any oter interested parties.  
Information sharing may also be supplemented by other available resources 
such as APCIS and Lloyds.

 Report 10 -204 7.5. Vessel s' machinery installations and their control systems are complex, and regardless of how 
well maintained they are there will always remain the possibility that some part  fails for some 
reason.  For a vessel  like the Hanjin Bo mbay  that ha s only one propulsion system, the risk of 
losing control of the vessel  caused by a single -point failure is higher than that for other vessel s 
that have greater level s of redundancy built in  to their propulsion and power -management 
systems.  The se type s of vessel  rely heavily on tug services when operating in confined 
pilotage waters.  
Port of Tauranga  Limited 's Port and Harbour Safety s ystem policy on the level of tug service 
did not adequately manage the risk of single -point failures leading to the loss of control of a 
vessel .  This is a safety issue that could also be rel evant to other New Zealand ports.  
The Maritime Transp ort Act 1994 currently restricts  the Director's powers to audit port 
operators.  However,  the Commission notes  that the Marine Legislation Bill currently before 
Parliament will introduce a new Part 3A to the Maritime  Transport Act , which will provide clear 
authority for the Director to take action in relation to port operations .   
The Commission recommends that , once the Marine Legislation Bill has been  enacted and the 
new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force , the Director address this  safety  issue 
with all port authorities , including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port 
and Harb our Safety Management Systems.  (005/13 ) 
On 23 April 2013, the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand replied:  
MNZ already does raise such matters with all port and harbourmasters when 
approving and auditing port and harbour safety management systems (SMS' s) 
under the voluntary New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code (the 
Code).  Maritime New Zealand will continue to do this.  
The Code places responsibility on individual port companies and councils for 
preparing risk assessments and reviewing them on  a regular basis, and for 
mitigating any risks identified in accordance with recognised risk management 
frameworks.  
The amendments to the Maritime Transport Act will include provisions for the 
Minister to make rules prescribing standards for port and harbo ur safety and for 
the Director to impose conditions on the use and operation of any commercial 
port.  These are intended to be reserve powers for use where there are 
significant safety, or environmental, issues.

 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Vessel  crews must have a thorough knowledge of their vessel s' operating systems if they are 
to deal  effectively with abnormal situations . 
8.2. The concept  of crew resource management must extend to all operational areas on a vessel , 
and in particular must result in a  common understanding of the voyage plan and good 
communication between bridge and engine room.  
8.3. The level of tug assistance given to vessel s when transiting narrow channels needs to be 
commensurate with the level of risk and should be decided on the basis of reducing the risk to 
as low as reasonably practicable.  
8.4. Shipboard operations must be conducted using an agreed common language that everyone 
can understand.  Crew members lapsing into their native tongue during an emergency is a 
breakdown in communicatio n that can seriously hinder any response to deal with the 
emergency.

 Appendix 1 : Details of the examination and tests carried out on the 
equipment  and systems on -board the Hanjin Bombay   
A.1.1.  The 3 -way control valve for the main engine  jacket -cooling fresh water was removed from 
the system and taken to the vessel's on -board workshop for disassembly and inspection.  
The results of that inspection are show n below.  Numbers in the text refer to the part 
numbers highlighted in Figure A1-1: Diagram of 3 -way control valve for main engine  jacket -
cooling fresh water.  
 The lower bend (2) was removed and the stainless valve trim was found to be in good 
condition.   
 There was no evidence of wear in the lower bushes (13b)  or any signs of binding.   
 There was no sign of wear in the lower valve spindle (7) or scale build -up present.  
 The upper valve spindle (7) was initially sighted through the cooler bypass inlet (B), 
where a small amount of scale build -up on one side of the spindle was evident; this 
did not affect the operation of the valve.  
 The valve seat (8) for the cooler inlet (C) was examined and found to be in good 
condition; the valve was then lowered by hand in to the cooler bypass position and the 
bypass valve seat (9) examined and found to be in good condition.  The valve head (7) 
was also examined and found to be in good condition.  
 The play at the end of the valve spindle (7) was checked with a dial test indic ator and 
a reading of about 1 mm was obtained.   
 The return spring (19) was sighted and found to be in good condition with no signs of 
corrosion . 
 The diaphragm (25) was opened for inspection, and the rubber was found to be in 
good condition with no signs o f air leakage.    
A.1.2.  The 3-way valve was then reassembled using manufacturer -supplied spares where 
appropriate , and the operation of the 3 -way valve  tested under simulated conditions .   
A.1.3.  The automatic controller for the 3 -way valve was examined, and the alarm l imits checked .  
 The high -temperature alarm for the jacket -cooling wate r was set at 90 °C. 
 The temperature for the  automatic slowdown of the main engine  was set at 90 °C. 
 The temperature for the automatic shutdown of the main engine  was set at 95 °C.   
 The manufacturer's standard  temperature  setting for the 3 -way valve  to commence 
operating was 80 °C.   
A.1.4.  The 3 -way valve  supply and return pneumatic pressures  were  checked during simulated 
operation cycles .  With the valve indicator showing fully open in the bypa ss condition , the 
supply pressure was 1.4 kilograms per square centimetre (137.3 kilopascal s) and  the 
output pressure was 1.4 kilograms per square centimetre (137.3 kilopascal s).  With the 
valve indicator showing fully open in the cooler position , the supp ly pressure was 1.4 
kilograms per square centimetre (137.3 kilopascal s) and the output pressure was 0.13 
kilograms per square centimetre (12.749 kilopascal s).   
A.1.5.  The filter regulator for the automatic controller complete with the air supply pressure gauge 
was checked and a new pressure gauge was fitted.  The pressure gauge at the time of the 
incident was showing 1.4 kilogram s force per square centimetre  (137.3 kilopascal s).  The 
new pressure gauge showed a reading of 0.9 bar (90 kilopascal s) and the air supply 
pressure was increased to 1.4 bar (140 kilopascal s).
