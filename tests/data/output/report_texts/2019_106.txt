 About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of 
inquiry and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation 
and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, an d co-ordinating and co -operating with 
other accident investigation organisations overseas.  
The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of 
occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  It is n ot the 
Commission's purpose to ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (or to assist an 
agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or agency.  However, 
the Commission will not refrain from fully reporting on the  circu mstances and factors 
contributing to an accident because fault or liability may be inferred from the findings.

 1 Executive summary  
What happened  
1.1 At about 1802  on 3 September 2019 , the daily TranzAlpine service was approaching 
Rolleston station on a return journey from Greymouth to Christchurch. The train was 
incorrectly routed onto the West Main Line. The platform at Rolleston could not be 
accessed from this track , and two passenge rs who disembarked walked across the East 
Main Line without the knowledge of train control . 
1.2 The process of disembarking the two passengers from the train took a matter of 
seconds to complete . However, the y were disembarked onto the ballast between the 
West and East Main Line s and crossed the East Main Line  without any form of blocking 
protection being established.   
Why it happened  
1.3 When the train driver and train controller became aware that the train had been routed  
onto the incorrec t line , neither made an attempt to contact the other to discuss the 
situation and  formulate a recove ry plan.  
1.4 The decision to disembark the passengers between the tracks was based on the train 
driver's own assessment that it was a low-risk operation . It did not include any input 
from the onboard service manager , who was responsible for passenger safety . 
1.5 KiwiRail has subsequently created a direction to train control using  a semi-permanent 
bulletin  to prevent passenger trains being routed to the  West Main Line at Rolleston . 
KiwiRail has also drafted  instructions  to train crews  for the controlled disembarkation 
of passengers when a platform is not available .  
What we can learn  
1.6 All personnel involved in safety -critical operations should adhere to the principl es of 
non-technical skills to ensure that all parties have a common understanding of what is 
required to complete tasks safely.  
Who may benefit  
1.7 All train crews and train controllers  will benefit from the findings and key lessons in this 
report.

 Final Report RO -2019 -106 2 Factual i nformation   
Narrative  
2.1 On 3 September a t about 0815 , a TranzAlpine passenger t rain (service number 8031) 
departed Addington station en  route to Greymouth with a scheduled arrival time of 
1315 . 
2.2 At approximately 0833 , two passengers were waiting to embark on the  Rolleston 
station  platform , which was about 26  kilometres west of Christchurch . The two 
passengers had not pre -booked using the operator's website and consequently were 
not included on the  passenger  manifest  prior to their embarking at Rolleston . The 
manifest informed  TranzAlpine staff where  passengers were embarking  and 
disembark ing along  the journey.  
2.3 During the journey from Christchurch to Greymouth, the train traversed two separate 
train control2 areas. Christchurch to Rolleston was controlled by the Main South Line 
(MSL) controller, and Rolleston to Greymouth was controlled by the Midland controller. 
Once the passengers had embarked the train at Rolleston, the train continued its 
journey to Greym outh.   
2.4 At about 1404, the train commenced its return journey from Greymouth to 
Christchurch as service 804.  At about 1802 the train was approaching the MSL control 
area and appeared on the MSL train controller's panel.  
2.5 The train controller was engaged in o ther control activities and service 804 was 
stopped briefly at 12R signal (see Figure 3), which was required to be cleared to 
proceed by the train controller.  When the controller became aware that 804 was 
stopped at 12R signal , they set the signal  for 804 to proceed to the MSL control area 
and traverse Rolleston via the West Main Line (see Figure 3). The usual route for 
passenger trains was to traverse the East Main Line to allow the train to stop alongside 
the platform if required.  
2.6 At 1802:59, 12R signal w as cleared to proceed and the  train driver (the driver)  started 
to move the train forward.  When 12R signal was set to proceed , the signalling system 
locked the route ahead of the train to ensure that the points3 could not be moved.  At 
1803:30 the train pa ssed 12R signal and entered Rolleston station limits.  
2.7 Around this time the driver realised that the route was set for the West Main Line , not 
the East Main Line , which was required  to bring the train alongside the platform to 
disembark passengers.  
At 1807:14 the driver continued along the set route and stopped the train on the West 
Main Line, adjacent to the platform but separated from it by the East Main Line (see 
Figure  4).
 
1 Service numbers are assigned to trains to denote the geographical areas, types of train and directions of travel. 
In this instance, '803' denotes a passenger train travelling on the Midland line in the down (south/west) 
direction, whereas '804' denotes a p assenger train travelling on the Midland line in the up (north/east) direction. 
Other types of train, such as freight and coal trains, are similarly assigned service numbers that denote their 
particular modes of operation.

2.8 The driver , having decided to disembark the passengers from the West Main  Line, 
discussed the situation with the train manager , who then arranged for the passengers 
to be disembarked . Two passengers disembarked from the train onto the ballast 
between the train and the East Main Line. They then walked across the East Main Line 
track to reach the platform at Rolleston station .  
2.9 At 1808:56 the train departed Rolleston en  route to Christchurch.

Personnel information  
2.10 The MSL train controller had about six months' experience in the role and held all 
relevant qualifications and current certification . 
2.11 The driver had 15 years' experience in the role and held all relevant qualifications and 
current certification.  
Additional information  
Midland line train movements  
2.12 The Midland line typically had 10 to 12 scheduled train movements per day , consisting 
of coal trains, freight trains and passenger trains, as well as other track movements 
such as hi -rail inspection vehicles and work trains.  The majority of these track 
movements were routed into and out of the Midland control area from the MSL 
control area via the West Main Line at Rolleston.  
2.13 In order to bring passenger cars alongside the platform at Rolleston, p assenger trains 
needed to be routed via the East Main Line.  This did not preclude non -passenger rail 
traffic being routed via the East M ain Line, but it was more efficient  for them  to travel 
via the West Main Line.

 Final Report RO -2019 -106 3 Analysis  
Introduction  
3.1 The safe separation of rail traffic and people on the rail corridor is a fundamental 
premise of any rail operation. Robust and proven rules and procedures exist that must 
be followed by all personnel prior to their entering the rail corridor to ensure that  
sufficient protection is in place.  
3.2 On this occasion,  two passengers were required to cross an operational railway track 
without any means of protection because  the train had been directed onto the wrong 
track in error.  
3.3 The following section analyses the c ircumstances surrounding the incident  to identify 
those factors  that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the 
severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues that had the potential to 
adversely affect future operations.  
Unintended  routing  
3.4 On the day of the incident the MSL was being controlled by a recently qualified train 
controller. The controller had completed 11 weeks ' train control classroom training in 
March 2019, followed by 14 weeks ' live training under the instr uction of a senior train 
controller. The live training included learning to route passenger trains via the East 
Main Line at Rolleston. The MSL controller had been qualified to operate solo for eight  
weeks.   
3.5 Around the time of the incident the train contro ller was engaged in radio and 
telephone conversations with various work parties. The train controller reported that 
they were aware train 804 was due to arrive at the MSL control area and had been 
monitoring the train's progress on 'GeVIS', a KiwiRail soft ware application that displays 
a dynamic geographical location of trains on the network.  
3.6 Although the train controller reported that they thought they had set the route for the 
East Main Line in preparation for the arrival of 804, the route at Rolleston wa s set for 
rail traffic to travel via the West Main Line. The train control graph4 showed that the  
most recent  train movement through Rolleston had been  routed via the West Main 
Line about four hours earlier . Routing rail traffic to either the East or West Main Line 
required the train controller to move  two sets of points , namely 1 and 7 points (see 
Figure 5).  
3.7 The train controller saw that train 804 was stopped outside the MSL control area at 12R 
signal.  Knowin g that passenger trains ran on a priority schedule and were not to be 
stopped where it could be avoided , the train controller cleared 12R signal to proceed.  
3.8 Afterwards, on r ealising the route was set for the West Main Line , the train controller 
immediatel y attempted to set the correct route using the East Main Line . However , the 
signalling system was already in the process of clearing 12R signal as set for the West 
Main Line and it rejected any further commands from the train controller.

<< Page 7 >>
 3.9 The relatively ine xperienced train controller had not set the East Main Line in 
preparation for the arrival of the passenger train. The unintended routing of the train 
to the West Main Line was not in itself unsafe.  
Decision to disembark passengers  
3.10 On approach to the MSL c ontrol area , the driver observed signals that indicated the 
train would have to stop at 12R signal  (see Figure 6). The driver was aware that 
stopping at the normal distance from 12R signal meant the train would be stopped 
across the Jones Road level crossing , which was  to the west of the signal . This would 
result in road traffic being blocked until the signal was cleared . Because of this , the 
driver decided to pull the train up as close as possible to the signal  to clear the level 
crossing behind the train.  
3.11 By pulling the train up close to the signal , the driver's view of the signal was partially 
obscured from inside the locomotive . Only the bottom unit of the signal was visible 
(see Figure 7). 
3.12 The driver reported that the train had been stopped for about five minutes before 12R 
signal was cleared and a proceed indication on the bottom unit of the signal was 
observed.  While the train was stopped the driver saw 4R signal on the MSL , and noted 
it was at red (stop) (see Figure 7). When 4R signal displayed stop , rail traffic travelling 
towards Christchurch on the MSL was prevented from entering the Rolleston section.  
The driver recalled being aware of this.  
3.13 Had the driver taken action to observe the entire 12R signal and not just the bottom 
unit, they would very likely have  seen that the top unit was showing that the route was 
set for the West Main Line. This would have provided an opportunity for the driver to 
stop and speak to the tra in controller and rectify the wrong -routing issue. However, 
the driver only observed a proceed signal on the bottom unit and acted on it in the 
expectation that the route was correctly set for the passenger train.   
3.14 The driver, having observed the proceed i ndication on 12R signal, began moving the 
train towards Rolleston and entered the MSL control area.  
3.15 The driver stated that, a s the train rounded a left-hand curve towards Rolleston , they 
visually checked number 1 points . The driver stated that they saw they were set 
towards the West Main Line  and not the expected East Main Line.  
3.16 The driver had been informed earlier by the train crew that there were two passengers 
to disembark at Rolleston.  The driver knew that travelling along the West Main Line 
meant the t rain would not be able to stop alongside the platform, which was required 
to disembark passengers.

3.17 The driver reported assessing the risk  of disembarking the passengers onto the ballast 
between the tracks and  the passengers  walking to the platform escorted by a member 
of the train crew. This assessment considered : 
• knowledge of how the signalling system worked and the protection it would 
provide   
• the clear view of the rail corridor in both directions from the locomotive cab for 
any approaching rail traffic  
• the short distance the passengers would have to walk to the safety of the 
platform . 
3.18 The driver assessed that , under the circumstances , it was the safest and most expedient 
option , and decided to proceed .

 3.19 The driver com municated this decision to the train m anager, who explained the 
situation to the disembarking passengers . The train manager  reported to the driver 
that the p assengers were willing to step down onto the ballast and walk the 3.5 metres 
over the East Main Line and on to the platform.  
3.20 The driver made no attempt to contact train control after becoming aware that the 
train had been wrong routed , nor did they make contact with the onboard service 
manager (OSM )5 to discuss a plan for disembarking the passengers. The OSM was 
responsible for all aspects of passenger safety but was not included in the decision -
making  process regarding the passenger disembarkation. Th e lack of effective 
communication is d iscussed further in section 3.33. 
3.21 Once the train had  stopped on the West Main Line, the train m anager assisted the two 
passengers from the train and waited until the y were clear of the rail corridor before 
informing the driver that the disembarkation was complete.  When the passengers 
stepped safely onto the platform , the driver began moving the train and departed 
Rolleston towards Christchurch.  
3.22 Given the safety implica tions of pas sengers walking across a track , it was an operation 
better suited to oversight by the OSM. However, o n this occasion the OSM was left out 
of the communication and decision -making  process.  When the OSM finally became 
aware of the events taking p lace, it was too late to intervene as the passengers had 
already disembarked.   
3.23 While the driver was in charge of the overall safe operation of the train, the OSM bore 
responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of the passengers. The OSM was assisted by 
the train manager, who  was to follow the direction of the OSM in matters of passenger 
safety.  
Communication between driver and train control  
3.24 The train controller did not attempt to contact the driver of train 804 after the train 
passed 12R signal , and as a result remained unaware that passengers were 
disembarking at Rolleston until after the incident was reported to KiwiRail.  
3.25 The lack of communication between the train controller and the driver resulted in there 
being n o form of blocking protection , other than that provided by the signalling 
system interlocking , to protect the passengers crossing the East Main Line.  
3.26 This would  have potentially put the passengers who were crossing the track at risk had 
any rail traffic be en in the same section.  
3.27 Had the train controller and the driver communicated to discuss the situation, the 
requirement for the passenger disembarkation would likely have become apparent and 
a joint plan established to carry it out safely.  
3.28 The driver was o f the view that the disembarkation process could be carried out safely ; 
however , it would have been prudent to advise train control of the situation. Train 
control had a more complete picture of what was happening on the network, whereas 
the driver based t he safety assessment only on what was visible at the time.  
 
5 The onboard service manager has overall responsibility for the conduct of the on -board service crews and the 
boarding and de -training of passengers.

 Final Report RO -2019 -106 Signalling system protection  
3.29 Setting the signal at the northern end of Rolleston to proceed  meant that signals could 
not be cleared in the opposite direction towards Rolleston . This effectively blo cked that 
section of track for the sole occupancy of train 804. 
3.30 Similarly, the signalling system would not allow 4R signal (see Figure 5) to be set to 
proceed as it was  interlocked  with 12R signal to provide flank protection6. 
3.31 This combination of signalling system protection on the East Main Line from the north 
and south directions had the effect of blocking any train movements from entering 
Rolleston on the East Main Line while the passengers were crossing it on their way to 
the platform . It would not , however , have had any effect on rail traffic that could have 
already been in the section at the  time.  
Non-technical skills  
3.32 The Rail Safety and Standards Board of the United Kingdom defines non -technical skills 
as "the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement technical skills 
and contribute to safe  and efficient task performance". While technical skills describe 
what you need to do and know for a given safety -critical task, non -technical skills 
describe how you do that task. The non -technical skill components can be broken 
down further into sub -categories that include situational awareness, conscientiousness, 
communication, decision -making and action, co -operation and working with others, 
workload management and self -management.  
3.33 All the key personnel involved in this incident had  undergone training i n non -technical 
skills. Nevertheless, the incident highlighted the dangers that can still occur when non -
technical skills are not used, or not used effectively . On this occasion , when  the train 
was stopped at 12R signal it was a good opportunity for the dr iver to confirm the full 
signal indication.  It would have become immediately apparent that the train was about 
to be wrong routed and should have triggered communication between  the driver, 
train control and the train crew to regain situational awareness a nd ensure there was a 
common mental model for all involved.   
3.34 If the train controller had been made aware before the train passed 12R signal that 
passengers were disembarking at Rolleston , the route could have been corrected or 
electronic blocking7 could have been applied to provide additional  protection  for the 
passengers crossing the East M ain Line. 
3.35 Similarly, h ad the O SM been included in the driver's risk assessment and decision -
making process , alternative  options for disembarking the passengers safely could have 
been considered , such as the passengers remaining on the train and returning by taxi 
to Rolleston .  
3.36 The w rong routing of the train by the train controller was a relatively strai ghtforward 
situation that could have been resolved  safely. Resolv ing it required  a better use of 
non-technical skills , particularly communication skills , by all those involved.   
 
6 A means of protecting movements of trains across junctions by the setting of points (either manually or 
automatically) that prevent any other unauthorised movement coming into contact with them.  
7 A protection activated on the signalling system operated by train control , when required , to ensure that signals 
and points are not cleared into a protected work area or to prevent conflicting rail movements . 
 
Final Report RO -2019 -106 
<< Page 11 >>
 3.37 The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) has raised the issue of 
non-technical skills in several rail occurrence reports, including in a recommendation to 
the Chief Executive of Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (002/12):  
The Commission r ecommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that 
(the agency) require the Executive of the National Rail System Standard to develop 
standards to ensure that all rail participants meet a consistently high level of crew 
resource management, a nd communication that includes the use of standard rail 
phraseology.  
3.38 As a result of this recommendation KiwiRail implemented training programmes that 
included the principles of non -technical skills. All personnel involved in this incident 
had been trained to some extent in these principles . This incident highlighted the 
importance  of ensuring  that the principles remain prominent in workers' minds as an 
important tool in planning for any safe -working scenario.  
3.39 On 3 April 2017 , Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agenc y said it was continuing to work with 
KiwiRail on addressing the recommendation. At the time of publication  the 
recommendation remains open.  
Procedures  
Safety issue: No procedures were in place to direct  train crews  and controllers  in the action to 
be take n in the event of berthing on the West Main Line. 
3.40 At the time of the incident there was no rule promulgated by KiwiRail stipulating that 
passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at Rolleston, nor were there any 
procedures recommending  action s to be taken  in the event that a passenger train had 
to berth on the West Main Line. KiwiRail relied on the local knowledge of train 
controllers to ensure that passenger trains were routed cor rectly.  
3.41 Since the incident KiwiRail has promulgated Semi -Permanent Bulletin8 913, which 
include s new instructions for berthing passenger trains at Rolleston and state s in part:  
All passenger trains must be berthed on the East Main at Rolleston to facilita te 
passenger pick up and set down.  
Exception: The West Main may be used to berth passenger trains only when the East 
Main is obstructed (e.g. disabled train, track fault) and authorised by the Network 
Control Manager.  
Train crew are to be consulted on any West Main berthing.  
3.42 KiwiRail has also provided the Commission with a draft version  of a train crew response 
plan for all passenger services on the KiwiRail network throughout New Zealand . This 
plan outlines  the actions to be taken to disembark passengers  safely  if passenger trains 
cannot be  berthed at a platform.  
3.43 Due to the actions taken by KiwiRail to address the issue , the Commission does not 
intend to make a recommendation on this matter.  
 
8 A means of promulgating a change to operating procedures or rules with immediate effect, without having to 
change the existing rulebook in entirety.

 Final Report RO -2019 -106 4 Findings  
4.1 The correct East Main Line route had not been  set in preparation for the arrival of a 
passenger train because the train controller had become distracted with other train  
controlling tasks.  The unintended routing of the train to the West Main Line was not  
inherently  unsafe . 
4.2 Disembarking the passengers  not alongside the platform and without the knowledge 
of the train controller increased the  risk to these passengers . Effective communication 
between those parties responsible for the safety of passengers could have mitigated 
this risk . 
4.3 There was no rule that stipulated passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at 
Rolleston , nor were there any instructions recommending  the action to take in the 
event a passenger train was berth ed on the West Main Line.

 5 Safety issues and remedial  action  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.   
5.2 Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a  participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Lack of procedures for inadvertent berthing on the West Main Line  
5.3 At the time of the incident there was no KiwiRail rule prescribing the travel of 
passenger trains via  the East Main Line at Rolleston, nor were there any procedures 
prescribing the action s to take in the event of a passenger train berthing on the West 
Main Line.

 TAIC Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngati Raukawa, Tuwharetoa, 
MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking knowledge to 
understand transport accident tragedies an d how to prevent them. A 'waka whai mārama (i te ara haumaru) is 'a 
vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding'. Waka is metaphor for the Commission. Mārama (from 'te ao mārama' 
- the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papa tūānuku (Earth Mother) by their son 
Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling within), which brought light and thus awareness to the 
world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe or risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - The safe an d risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother and 
child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge that 
Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual wave is 
the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: ng ā hau e whā - the four winds  
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā' (the four winds), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming together 
from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, cloud, and 
wind. The re is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 'long white cloud'. The 
letter 'A' is present, standing for aviation.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwha i. 
Marine: ara wai - waterways  
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships sail 
across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for 'Marine'.  
Sand y acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the land. 
The koru forms rep resent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is present, 
standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything that 
dwells within) in the creation of  this Kōwhaiwhai.
