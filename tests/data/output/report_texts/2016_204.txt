The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropri ate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost  of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its pu rpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 0600 on 19 August 2016, the bulk carrier Molly Manx  arrived off Port Otago after an 
overnight passage from Lyttelton.  A harbour pilot boarded the vessel  at about 0630 and, after 
exchanging information with the master, the vessel  entered the narrow channel taking it to its 
berth.  
1.2. The Molly Manx  was the maximum permitted length for vessel s navigat ing the upper portion of 
the channel.  
1.3. The vessel  had just pas sed Port Chalmers and was approaching a narrow passage between 
two islands known as  the Halfway Islands with the pilot conducting the navigation of the 
vessel .  Two tugs were in attendance: one connected to the stern of the vessel  and one 
ranging ahead of the vessel , waiting to assist.  
1.4. As the vessel  neared the Halfway Islands it deviated from  the intended track and grounded on 
a sand bank.  With the aid of the vessel 's engine and the tug connected to the stern, the 
vessel  was able to reverse off the sand ba nk, after which it was manoeuvred stern -first back 
to Port Chalmers for assessment.  
1.5. There was no breach of the hull , and damage was limited to the bottom paintwork.  Nobody 
was injured.  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the vessel  
grounded because the bridge team lost situational awareness .  Because the bridge team was 
not adequately monitoring its progress using all available means , they did  not realise that the 
vessel  had deviated so far starboard from  the intended  track .  
1.7. The Commission also found  that: there was no formal  shared understanding between the pilot 
and the vessel 's crew on what passage plan would be used ; the vessel 's navigation equipment 
was not correctly configured for navigating in a narrow channel;  and the standard of bridge 
resource management on the bridge leading up to the grounding did not meet good industry 
practice.  
1.8. The Commission identified four safety issues  relating to the standard of passage planning and 
the performance of the bridge team.  
1.9. The Commission made three recommendations  to the  Director of Maritime New Zealand to 
address those safety issues identified  
1.10.  Key lesson s arising from this inquiry include:  
 there must be an absolute agreement and shared understanding between the 
vessel 's bridge team and the pilot as to the passage plan and monitoring against that 
plan 
 vessel s' bridge teams must actively promote and use the concept of bridge resource 
management, including the incorporation of pilot s into the bridge team s, to manage 
voyage s properly  
 a vessel's electronic chart display and information system ( ECDIS ) is an important 
system for monitoring the progress of the vessel  and warning the bridge team when 
things could go wrong.  It is essential that it be configured correctly for the ph ase of 
navigation and the proximity to navigation hazards .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was advised of the 
occurrence by email from Maritime New Zealand on 19 August  2016 , the day of the 
occurrence.  The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 19 August contact was established with the Isle of Man flag administration and agree ment 
was reached that New Zealand would lead the investigation and conduct the investigation on 
behalf of the Isle of Man.  
2.3. On 19 August two investigators travelled to Dunedin, where the Molly Manx  was berthed.  On 
20 August the investigators conducted int erviews with the crew of the vessel and collected 
evidence that included a download of the vessel's voyage data recorder.  
2.4. On 21 August the investigators interviewed staff from Port Otago and the acting 
harbour master.  They also gathered further documents relating to the port operations .   
2.5. On 22 August contact was established with the vessel's operator , and documents relating to 
the company operation were  obtained.  Additional  information was obtained  from  Maritime 
New Zealand  and from the vessel.  
2.6. On 17 Jan uary 2017 investigators conducted further interviews with  staff from Port Otago in  
order to clarify information.  
2.7. On 24 August 2017  the Commission approved the draft report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment.   
2.8. The draft report was distribut ed to 12 interested parties on 4 September 2017 , with the 
closing date for receiving submissions as 25 September 2017 .  Six submissions were receiv ed 
that included comments .   
2.9. The Commission has considered in detail all submissions made , and any changes as  a result 
of those submissions have been included in the final report . 
2.10.  On 25 October 2017  the Commission approved the report for publication .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  At about 0600 o n 19 August 2016 , the bulk carrier Molly Manx  arrived off Port Otago after a n 
overnight  passage from Lyttelton.  The vessel was bound , with a cargo of phosphate rock , for 
the Ravensbourne fertiliser t erminal , which was in the upper reaches of the harbour between 
Port Chalmers and Dunedin.  The bridge team tested all the navigation and communication 
equipment and tested the main engine ahead and astern .    
3.1.2.  An Otago Harbour pilot boarded the vessel at about 0630 .  The master and pilot conducted an 
exchange of information .  The pilot explained the Otago Harbour Passage Plan and the Otago 
Harbour Passage Planning Guide .  The passage planning guide was the document produced 
by the harbour authority that contain ed relevant navigational information to assist the vessel's 
bridge team in constructing the preferred Port Otago passage plan  into Port Otago.  The master 
in turn explained the information contained on the vessel's pilot card2 (see Appendix 1) .  The 
pilot noted that the vessel's arrival draught  was deeper than  that which  the master had 
previously reported.  The deepest draught was 7.1 metres (m), which was still within the 
maximum allowable draught of 7.4 m for berthin g. 
3.1.3.  The pilot then took the con3 from the master and the vessel  headed towards the harbour 
entrance channel .  The main engine was increased to full sea speed to achieve the optimum 
speed of 12 knots4 for the first section of the pilotage . 
3.1.4.  At 0719 w hen the Molly Manx  was passing Pulling Point (see Figure 1) , the pilot requested a 
reduction in speed  from full sea speed to manoeuvring speed , and by the time the vessel 
reached  Deborah Bay (see Figure 1) it was making  about 8 knots  over the ground . 
3.1.5.  At about 0730 , as the vessel passed Port Chalmers , the pilot reduced the engine revolutions 
to half ahead5.  Shortly afterwards the line of the tug Taiaroa  was secure d to the stern of the 
vessel .  The Taiaroa  then followed behind the Molly Manx  with no weight on the line.  The tug 
Otago  proceeded ahead of the vessel , ready to assist with berthing . 
3.1.6.  As the Molly Manx  passed  Port Chalmers , the pilot pointed out to the master the leading line 
beacons6 he intended to use  to guide the vessel  through th e narrow gap between Quarantine 
and Goat Islands (referred to as Halfway Islands on the chart - see Figure 1) .  At that time the 
leading marks showed that  the vessel  was to starboard of the intended track , which t he pilot 
was aware of and where he planned the vessel  to be  once he had commenced the turn to 
starboard . 
3.1.7.  As the vessel  approached the Halfway Islands the pilot was standing at the front of the bridge 
on or just to starboard  of the centreline of the vessel , using the  line of the  deck cranes to 
judge the heading of the vessel .  He occasionally  left this position to check  the vessel's speed 
on the electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)  located in the aft -facing 
console behind him .  The pilot said that he could see  that the channel between the islands 
was clear and that he was "about on the leads  [leading line beacons] ".   
                                                        
2 An information card, form or checklist used to ensure that essential master -pilot exchange items are 
covered.  
3 Control of the speed and direction of the vessel.  
4 Nautical  mile(s) per hour . 
5 A manoeuvring speed indication on the engine telegraph that results in a set amount of engine revolutions , 
which in turn will give rise to a certain speed for the vessel . 
6 Fixed markers that are laterally displaced to allow a mariner to navigate a fixed course along the preferred 
route. When lit, they are also usable at night. Usually the rear mark is higher than the front mark. The mariner 
will know the geometry of the marks/lights from the  navigational chart  and can understand that when 'open ' 
(not one above the other) the vessel needs to be navigated to 'close ' the marks (so one is above the other) 
and be in the prefe rred line of the channel.

3.1.8.  The members of the bridge team, including the pilot, then felt a bump that they initially 
thought was the aft tug bumping the stern of the vessel.   
3.1.9.  The pilot saw that the speed was reducing and he noted that the vessel's head was swinging 
to starboard despite the 10 degrees of port helm being applied.  Both the master and the pilot 
realised the vessel had grounded, and ordered stop engines, half astern  and full astern in 
quick succession.  

Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 6 >>
 3.1.10.  The Molly Manx  stopped in the water, aground  on sand .  The pilot called the tug Otago  ahead 
of the vessel and ordered it to return and secure a line to the  bow.  The pilot ordered the aft 
tug Taiaroa  to "lift off at  40 tonnes "7.  The vessel  started to move astern , at which time  the 
pilot ordered  the starboard anchor to be let go to one shackle8 (27.5 m) of cable in an attempt 
to steady the bow.  
3.1.11.  As the Molly Manx  moved astern into deeper water , the starboard anchor was raised .  The 
pilot then manoeuvred  the vessel  stern -first back to Port Chalmers where it was  made fast 
alongsid e Beach Street wharf.   Soundings of all the tanks and spaces on the vessel were 
taken to ensure that the watertight integrity had not been compromised.   
3.1.12.  At about 13 00 two pilots boarded  the Molly Manx  at Beach Street wharf and piloted it through 
the Upper Harbour  to the fertiliser terminal at Ravensbourne.  The operator of the vessel 
engaged a diving and salvage company to carry out an underwater inspection of the vessel to 
determine if any damage had occurred.   
3.2. Environmental conditions  
3.2.1.  The climatic c onditions were described as a light northerly breeze creating a significant 
northerly wave chop in the harbour of wind against the tide.  The visibility was good with clear 
skies.   At the time of the grounding the sun was just rising.   
3.2.2.  The tides for Duned in on 19 August 2016 were as tabled in the New Zealand Nautical 
Almanac shown below:

Table 1  
High and low water for Dunedin  
3.2.3.  The vessel could berth on either the flood  tide9 or the ebb tide10 provided that there was a 
sufficient depth of water for the vessel to turn .  Turning and berthing the vessel could only be 
achieved between certain times before and after high water ; this is known as the tidal 
window11 (see Figure 3).   
3.2.4.  The length of the  Molly Manx  was the maximum permitted for vessels transi ting the Upper 
Harbour.  It had a draught of 7.1 m, which gave it a tidal window that allowed the vessel to be 
swung around in the Upper Harbour to berth at the Ravensbourne fertiliser berth.   
3.2.5.  On joining the vessel,  the pilot  had used the  Port Otago pilot inf ormation sheet to confirm  that 
the vessel  could arrive off the berth within the tidal window , which he had then  explained to 
the master  (see Appendix 1) . 
                                                        
7 To pull away from the ship with a 40 -tonne bollard pull  (force).  
8 A vessel's anchor chain is usually divided into several sections of equal length (usually 27.5 metres or 
thereabouts) joined by a special joining shackle.  When the anchor and connecting chain are 'let go' from the 
windlass, the person in charg e on the forecastle head pays out the cable by a specified amount by counting 
the joining shackles.  Thus one shackle on deck would have the first joining shackle secured on the 
forecastle deck with the first 27.5 metres of cable and anchor leading through  the hawse pipe and into the 
water.   
9 The period between low tide and high tide when the water flows towards the shore . 
10 The period between high tide and low tide when the water flows away from the shore . 
11 A period of time in which a vessel is able to conduct a manoeuvre safely , such as entering a channel or 
turning in the channel. During a channel transit, tidal windows indicate the opening and closing times for 
carrying out manoeuvres safely at different locations in a safe depth of water.

 3.2.6.  The height of tide at the time of the grounding at the Halfway Islands was approximately 0.7 m

3.3. Vessel details  
3.3.1.  The Molly Manx  was a bulk  carrier and had its own shipboard cranes.  It  had been  built in 
Cebu, Philippines in 2010.  It was owned by Molly Marine Limited in the Isle of Man and was 
register ed in the Isle of Man.  It was operated by Anglo -Eastern Ship Management Limited of 
Hong Kong , and at the time of the accident it was chartered to LT Ugland Limited of the Isle of 
Man.   
3.3.2.  The Molly Manx  had a length overall of 189.99 m, a breadth of 32.26 m and a maximum 
draught of 12.826 m.  It was powered by a Mitsui M.A.N. - B&W DE 6550MC -C (Mark 7) direct 
reversing diesel engine producing 8,400 kilowatts at maximum continuous rating driving a 
single fixed -pitch , right -hand -turning , five-bladed propeller.  
3.3.3.  The Molly Manx  was equipped with the range of navigational equipment standard for this type 
of vessel , including an ECDIS and backup system that was compliant with international and 
Flag State rules and regulations.  This configuration meant that the vess el could use  the 
ECDIS as its primary method of navigation and was not required to carry paper charts.   
3.4. Electronic chart display and information system  
3.4.1.  The International Maritime Organization (IMO) describe d an ECDIS in the ECDIS Performance 
Standards (IM O Resolution A.817(19)) as:

 … a navigation information system which, with adequate back up arrangements, 
can be accepted as complying with the up -to-date chart required by regulation 
V/19 & V/27 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention13, by displaying selected 
informa tion from navigation sensors to assist the mariner in route planning and 
route monitoring, and by displaying additional navigation -related information if 
required.    
3.4.2.  The master and all navigational officers on board the Molly Manx  were correctly certified and 
had undertaken both generic and type -specific ECDIS training.  
3.4.3.  User -defined safety settings are an important safety function when using an ECDIS.  A failure 
to enter the correct safety settings can allow a vessel to enter unsafe waters without alerting 
the operator.  To achieve a safe passage plan, users of ECDIS s must understand how to 
determine  accurately  the correct value for a safety setting , as detailed in Table 2.  
3.4.4.  IMO specifications require d an ECDIS to trigger certain alarms for the following cond itions (see 
Table 2  on 
<< page 1 >>
 7): 
 if the vessel is predicted to cross the safety contour within a user -specified time  
 if the vessel is predicted to cross the boundary of a prohibited area or an area for 
which special conditions exist within a specified time  
 if the vessel deviates off course by a specified amount from the planned route; cross -
track distance  
 if the vessel continues on its present course over a user -defined time or distance and 
is predicted to pass closer to an object that is shallower than the  safety contour or an 
aid to navigation.

3.5. Passage planning  
3.5.1.  The IMO's Resolution  A.893(21) , Guidelines for Voyage Planning , adopted on 25 November 
1999  (see Appendix 3) , describe voyage (passage) planning as:  
1.1 The development of a plan for voyage or passage, as well as the close and 
continuous monitoring of the vessel 's progress and position during the execution 
of such a p lan, are of essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and 
efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment.  
1.2 The need for voyage and passage planning applies to all vessels. There are 
several factors that may impede the saf e navigation of all vessels and additional 
factors that may impede the navigation of large vessels or vessels carrying 
hazardous cargoes. These factors will need to be taken into account in the 
preparation of the plan and in the subsequent monitoring of th e execution of the 
plan.  
1.3 Voyage and passage planning includes appraisal, i.e. gathering all 
information relevant to the contemplated voyage or passage; detailed planning of 
the whole voyage or passage from berth to berth, including those areas 
necessit ating the presence of a pilot; execution of the plan; and the monitoring of 
the progress of the vessel in the implementation of the plan.   
A more detailed explanation of the requirements can be found in Appendix 3.

 3.6. Bridge resource management  
3.6.1.  Bridge re source management (BRM) was adopted in the early 1990s by the maritime industry 
as a safety and error management tool.  It has since  become an integral part of crew training 
and is included in the International Convention on Standards of Certification and Training and 
Watchkeeping developed by the IMO ( see Appendix 2).   
3.6.2.  BRM is described as the effective management and utilisation of all resources, human and 
technical, available to a bridge team, to help ensure the safe completion of the vessel's 
voyage.  
3.6.3.  Some essential aspects of BRM are good closed -loop communications14, participants sharing 
the same understanding  of a planned passage, and maintaining situational awareness.  
  
                                                        
14  A technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats this back. The 
sender then confirms the message , usually by using the word 'yes'. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message 
back, the sender will say "negative", or something similar, and then repeat the correct message.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  A vessel grounding, for however short a time, is a serious occurrence that can cause  damage 
to the vessel and the environment.  
4.1.2.  Many large vessels successfully complete the transit of  the Upper Harbour under pilotage 
every year.  The following analysis discusses  why on this occasion the vessel grounded.   It also 
discusses four safety issues:  
 the vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a 
common passage plan before the pilotage began.  Consequently the pilot and the 
vessel 's bridge team had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed 
and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan  
 the IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to , but 
there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and 
use to meet those same standards  
 the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO 
and company standards when the grounding occurred  
 the standard of  BRM  on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago pilotage did not meet 
good industry practice . 
4.1.3.  The length of the  Molly Manx  was the maximum permitted  for a vessel  transit ing the Upper 
Harbour , and with a draught of 7.1 m there was little margin for error . This meant  it was 
important for the transit to be carefully managed and monitored by the bridge team.  
4.1.4.  The vessel was correctly certified and was manned with crew in excess of the safe manning 
certificate .  The pilot who joined the vessel off the harbour entrance held a pilot's licence  that 
was current for piloting a vessel  of the type and size of the Molly Manx  in that port .   
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The pilot had successfully piloted the vessel from beyond the entrance to Otago Harbour  and 
was maintain ing a speed that would allow him to berth the Molly Manx  within the available 
tidal window.  As the vessel approached Port Chalmers , the pilot reduced the speed of the 
vessel as the two tugs arrived to assist .  One tug proceeded ahead of the vessel while the 
other was secured to  the stern.   Having the  tug secured to  the stern would have allow ed the 
pilot to use it as a means of reducing speed or to  assist with steering .  The speed of the vessel  
and the configuration of the assisting tugs were appropriate for the passage between the 
Halfway Islands.  
4.2.2.  The Molly Manx  passed Port Chalmers and a log storage area and storage sheds .  The ebb 
tide as shown on the chart  (see Figure 3)  would normally  have  push ed (set15) the vessel  from 
left to right (port to starboard) as the vessel  approached the narrows .  However, the Otago 
Harbour pilots were aware that during an ebb tide the vessel  would be  first affected by the 
tidal stream emanating from behind Goat Island that would set the vessel  from right to left 
(starboard to port) .  It was for this reason  that the pilot was comfortable with being to 
starboard of the planned track as the vessel  was passing the storage sheds , in anticipation of 
the vessel  being set back onto the planned track before navigating between the islands.  
4.2.3.  When  the vessel  passed  the storage s heds , the pilot ordered starboard helm to start the turn 
into the channel to pass between Quarantine and Goat Island s and to counteract his 
prediction that there would be a strong set from right to left  from the ebb tide  flowing  between 
Goat Island and the Port Chalmers peninsula  (see Figure 3) .   
4.2.4.  The pilot was standing at the front of the navigating bridge either on the centreline of the 
vessel or one or two paces to starboard .  From his position he  could see clear ly down the 
                                                        
15 Be pushed towards - set towards . 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 12 >>
 channel between the islands  and the leading line beacons beyond .  From his position he was 
not able to see either the radar or the ECDIS screen .  He was navigating the vessel by eye with 
an occasional check on the vessel 's speed  log readout on the panel above the forward bridge 
windows .   
4.2.5.  Using data downloaded from the vessel 's voyage data recorder  it was possible to calculate the 
vessel 's heading and match that to the true course and speed over the ground  at the time 
(see Figure 2.  The data show ed that from  0734 :20 the tidal stream between Goat Island and 
Port Chalmers did set the vessel  from right to left as predicted by the pilot.  However , the pilot 
adjusted the heading of the vessel  to counter this set and the vessel  remained to  starboard of 
the planned track.  
4.2.6.  The vessel  then enter ed the area where it began to be set in the opposite direction, from left 
to right, the n move d further to starboard of the planned track . 
4.2.7.  The pilot made a succession of helm orders for 5 , 10 and then 15 degrees of port helm and 
then ordered the helm to "amidships " in anticipation of the change in direction of the tidal set .  
The pilot then noticed that  the vessel was to starboard of the line of the leading beacon s.  He 
ordered 5 then 10 degrees of port  helm and then ordered the helm to amidships.  
4.2.8.  However,  although the bow of the vessel  was pointing towards the gap between the islands, 
the vessel  was still too far to starboard of the  planned track , and the bow of the vessel  
entered the area of shallow wa ter inside of Goat Island and grounded.  The momentum of the 
vessel  carried it over the shallow water, causing it to swing to starboard (see Figure 5). 
4.2.9.  Until the pilot felt the vessel grounding, he had not appreciated how far to starboard of the 
planned tr ack the vessel  was.  He had lost awareness of exactly where the vessel  was in the 
channel and the influence that the tide was having on its progress.  The  risk of this happening 
is high when navigating large vessel s in narrow channels  using only visual references to 
monitor the vessel s' progress.  It is why all available means by all available persons should be 
used to monitor the progress of a vessel  along its planned track.  These points are discussed 
in more detail in the following sections.  
4.2.10.  The pilot realised that  something was wrong when he , along with the rest of the bridge team , 
felt a bump .  He noticed that the speed of the vessel was slowing and the vessel's bow was 
swing ing to starboard despite  his havin g just applied port hel m.  He realised from these 
indicators that the vessel was grounding  and immediately ordered the engine  to stop and then 
astern and for the tug secured aft to pull right aft .  In doing so the  pilot was able  to manoeuvre 
the vessel off the bank and back into  deeper water . 
Finding s 
1. The grounding occurred because the bridge team , including the pilot , lost 
situational awareness and did not realise that the vessel  had deviated so far 
starboard of the intended track . 
2. The bridge team , including the pilot , did not realise how far the vessel  had 
deviated from the intended track because they were not monitoring the vessel 's 
progress effectively and by all available means .

 4.3. Passage planning  
Safety issue: The vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of  a 
common passage plan before the pilotage began.  Consequently,  the pilot and the vessel 's 
bridge team had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed and their 
respective roles in monitoring against the plan.  
Safety issue : The IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to, 
but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that port authorities  create 
and use to meet those same standards . 
4.3.1.  When a pilot joins a vessel prior to the pilotage it is the first opportunity for the master and 
bridge team to : talk to the pilot; clarify any issues that may have been identified during the 
preparation of the passage plan; and ensure they are satisfied with the planned transit.  At 
this stage the pilot needs to be fully integrated into the bridge organisation so that the whole 
team works as a cohesive body and has a shared understanding  of the p assage plan . 
4.3.2.  Before any pilotage act begins, it is essential that the pilot and the master (including other 
members of the team) have a shared understanding of  the passage plan.  That did not happen 
in this case.  As often happens, the pilot intended  to na vigate to the standard port company 
passage plan , and the vessel  had its own passage plan, which  differed  from that of the port 
company . 
4.3.3.  An essential part of integrating the pilot into the bridge team is the pilot and master exchange 
of information, a briefing that should include all members of the bridge team.  The briefing is a 
bilateral exchange of important information where everyone is made aware of : any changes to 
the proposed plan ; the handling characteristics of the vessel ; and any notable 'dyna mic' 
information such as weather and tides  for the transit.   
4.3.4.  The port passage plan was available over the internet from the Port Otago  website .  The 
channel is narrow and there is little scope for deviating from the plan without leaving the 
navigational c hannel.  The preferred courses were presented as  smooth , curved lines without 
any marked waypoints, turn radii or off -track limits.  Without that information the vessel 's crew 
would not have been  able to replicate it in their own navigation systems, such a s the ECDIS .  
The vessel  was required to plan the passage in accordance with the IMO convention standards 
and guidelines16 (see Appendix 3) , but there was no international or New Zealand requirement 
for the port companies and their pilots to follow the same  standards when developing their 
own generic passage plans.  The Port Otago passage plan as presented on its website would 
not meet the IMO  standards  or other reputable guidelines available to mariners on voyage 
planning17.   
4.3.5.  When the pilot joined the Molly  Manx  he and the master discussed the vessel's characteristics 
and went through the Otago Harbour passage  plan.  
4.3.6.  However, the vessel  had its own passage plan loaded into the ECDIS, which differed from that 
of Port Otago.  Because the vessel 's plan was the p lan loaded into the ECDIS, that is what the 
bridge team , excluding the pilot, was using to monitor the vessel's progress.  Me anwhile , the 
pilot was navigating the vessel  to the Port Otago  passage plan, using visual reference s as he 
had been  trained to do .  The bridge team, which now included the pilot, was not aligned in its 
thinking and did not share the same understanding  of the plan.  This dynamic was going to 
make effective BRM  difficult to achieve, which is discussed in the following section.  
4.3.7.  The New  Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code  is a voluntary national standard .  The 
Code recommends that , "Up-to-date passage plans and guidance should be published, and be 
available to harbour users and the masters of visiting vessel s" (see Appendix 6).  
                                                        
16 Chapt er V, Safety of Navigation, of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 
and Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning.  
17 Other best -practice guidelines also contain valuable advice on bridge watchkeeping in general and voyage 
planning in particular. They include: the United Kingdom's Maritime and Coastguard Agency's guidance on 
Chapter V, Safety of Navigation, of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ; the 
Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - A practical guide; and the International Chamber of 
Shipping's Bridge Procedures Guide.  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.3.8.  One method of ensuring that an approved passage plan is available on board would be for 
port companies or harbour authorities to make available to vessel s properly constructed and 
validated passage plan s that meet the  port-specific standards  and guidelines included in  
Chapter V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of 
Life at Sea  (SOLAS) , and Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning .  Such a system 
would assist in on-board passage planning and allow a v essel to be better prepared when the 
pilot boards .  This action would greatly assist the smooth transition of the pilot into the bridge 
team at a time of typically high workload and little time before the pilotage begins.  
4.3.9.  More vessel s are using ECDIS s as the primary means of navigation , and  this will increase in 
the future.  As it was  on board the Molly Manx , the passage plan to the berth is usually loaded 
into the vessel 's ECDIS.  Ideally, passage plans generated by port companies should be to the 
same IMO standard s that vessel s are required to meet , and should be compatible for use in 
an ECDIS.   
4.3.10.  Many vessel s transit more than one New Zealand port.  It would greatly enhance safety if the 
passage plans were, as far as practicable, in a standard format an d could be found at one 
site.  Vessel s routed to several New Zealand ports would be able to access from one place 
standardised passage plans for several ports, even before they depart ed from their previous 
overseas port s. 
4.3.11.  Currently there can be issues with uploading standardised passage plans into an ECDIS, 
because ECDIS manufacturers have proprietary systems that require specific formats.  
However,  that will shortly change.   The International Hydrographic Organization  and the 
International Electrotechnical  Commission standard for ECDIS s (IEC 61774 Edition 4, 
September 2015) from August 2017 includes a route exchange format that will make  it easier 
for data transfers.  In the future it will be possible to send passage plans to all vessels in the 
correct form at to be uploaded direct ly into the ECDIS system , thereby reducing the possibility 
of navigating officers making errors when loading them  into ECDIS s.  However, this facility was 
not available at the time of the accident and therefore was not able to be us ed by  the bridge 
team on this occasion.    
4.3.12.  The Commission has made recommendations to Maritime New Zealand to promote the use of 
standard passage plans by all New Zealand harbour authorities.  
4.4. Molly Manx  electronic chart display and information system  
Safety issue : The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by  the 
IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred.  
4.4.1.  The Molly Manx  was approved to use an ECDIS as a primary means of navigation and as such 
did not have to car ry or use paper charts for navigation.   
4.4.2.  User -defined safety settings are an important safety function when using an ECDIS.  A failure 
to enter the correct safety settings can allow a vessel to enter unsafe waters without alerting 
the operator.  To achieve  a safe passage plan, users of ECDIS s must understand how to 
determine  accurately  the correct value for a safety setting as detailed in Table 2  on 
<< page 1 >>
 6.  
The Molly Manx 's passage plan included settings for the deep contour, safety contour and 
safety depth, shallow contour, cross -track limit and watch vector setting s (look ahead).   
4.4.3.  Some of the values of user -defined ECDIS safety settings in use on board the Molly Manx  
differed from the values stated in the vessel's passage plan and from the usual defa ult 
settings.   
4.4.4.  The cross -track distance to either side of the vessel was set at 0.25 nautical miles or 463 m 
as per the passage plan.  However, the narrowest width of the Port Otago channel was 
approximately 100 m.  The vessel  would therefore  have been  413 m outside the channel 
before the cross -track distance alarm would activate.  At the position of the grounding the 
vessel was approximately 75 m off track.  The settings in the ECDIS were not appropriate for 
the intended passage into Port Otago.

 4.4.5.  The watch vector or predictor was required to be set for two minutes according to the passage 
plan.  At the time of the grounding the ECDIS display showed that the vector was set at 10 
minutes  rather than two minutes as  specified in the vessel's passage plan .  In a winding 
channel such as Otago Harbou r, setting the watch vector to 10 minutes would very likely 
cause the head of the vector to be constantly outside the safe navigable water within the 
channel, which mean s it would be in a constant state of alarm.  Apart from creating alarm 
management issue s for the officer of the watch ( OOW ), it was unable to alert the bridge team 
to any safety hazards ahead.   
4.4.6.  Accurate user -defined settings are essential if an ECDIS is to provide the level of navigational 
safety expected of it.  This accident shows how ine ffective it can become if the settings that 
have been entered are incorrect.  
4.5. Bridge resource management   
Safety issue: The standard of BRM  on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago pilotage did not 
meet good industry practice.  
Implementation o f BRM o n board   
4.5.1.  Achieving a high standard of BRM during the pilotage to Port Otago was going to be difficult 
because the fundamental requirement of all working to the same passage plan had not been 
met.  Nevertheless , effective BRM could still have prevented the groundi ng, but it was 
essentially absent amongst the bridge team.  
4.5.2.  The OOW  and the helmsman were part of the bridge team, but they were not included in the 
briefing  between the master and the pilot .  The absence of the OOW , the relieving OOW  and 
the helmsman from the briefing was  a missed opportunity to  ensure that everyone was 
sharing the same understanding , and  reinforce d the need to engage in challenge and 
response  and ensure that the pilot was incorporat ed into the bridge team.  
4.5.3.  The navigable channel through Otago Harbour to Dunedin is narrow .  For a vessel  the size of 
the Molly Manx  there are very few possible variations to the preferred  courses .  Even if the 
OOW had been monitoring the progress of the vessel  against the vessel 's passage plan with 
agreed off -track limits , the vessel 's deviation to starboard of the track could and should have 
been noticed and raised with the master and pilot.  However, the ECDIS had not been correctly 
configured for the transit of the narrow channel, and the OOW had not been in vited to 
challenge the master or pilot if the vessel  deviated from the intended route.  
4.5.4.  As the vessel entered the Otago Harbou r pilotage the OOW was relieved.  The relieving OOW 
was not briefed by the master on what was expected of him or made aware of significant 
information from the master -pilot exchange of information.  He was therefore not fully 
incorporated into the bridge team.  
4.5.5.  Despite the pilot advising the master at the master/pilot exchange that he welcomed being 
challenge d by the bridge team , and explaining the contents of the Port Otago Master/Pilot 
Information Exchange sheet (see Appendix 1) , which includes the notation:  
Despite the duties and obligations of a Pilot, the Pilot's presence on board does 
not relieve the Master o r Officer in char ge of the navigation watch from their 
duties and obligations for the safety of the vessel.  The Bridge Team have a duty 
to support the Pilot and to ensure that his/her actions are monitored at all times . 
the pilot said that after the OOWs had changed he soon realised that he was working very 
much on his own .  It was a situation that the pilot said he was familiar with .  As difficult as it 
will be to encourage a bridge team to engage  fully in the conduct of a vessel  when it is not 
their normal culture to do so, a pilot should nevertheless challenge the navigation team to do 
so, as should a navigation team do in a reciprocal situation where a pilot lapses into a one -
person operation .  A breakdown in BRM  can never be attributable to only one of the 
participants . 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 18 >>
 4.5.6.  The relieving OOW assumed  responsibility for : operating the  engine  telegraph ; monitoring the 
helmsman  and ensuring the correct helm was applied ; checking the under -keel clearance ; and 
checking the vessel' s position on the ECDIS .  These were important tasks.  Both the master 
and the OOW noticed the vessel  deviating to starboard, but neither spoke  up and alerted the 
pilot to the vessel's position .  There was silence on the bridge as the vessel  ran aground .     
4.5.7.  The company 's safety ma nagement system had comprehensive sections  on BRM and the 
requirement  for passage planning from berth to berth (see Appendix 5) (as contained in 
Chapter V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to SOLAS,  Regulation 34 Safe Navigation and  
Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning ) (see Appendix 3 for relevant parts).   
4.5.8.  However, i ncluding a requirement to practi se good BRM and planning the passage in a safety 
management system  does not fulfil a company 's and master's obligations in that regard .  
Puttin g the concepts into practice is the key.  Unless managers and masters  believe in, 
promote , practi se and drive good BRM  skills , they are unlikely to  succeed . 
4.5.9.  The Commission would normall y make a recommendation to the F lag State administration for  
the vessel to address through Flag S tate control any deficiencies in bridge practices.  
However, the vessel is now under different operation and has been re -registered with a 
different Flag State.  
Findings  
3. The pilot and the vessel's  bridge team did not have a shared understanding of  
one common  passage plan to the berth before the pilotage began, which meant 
they were not all sharing the same understanding  of the plan . 
4. The vessel's ECDIS was not correctly configured for navigation in a narrow 
channel, whi ch meant the crew were not adequately monitoring the progress of 
the vessel  in support of the pilot, who was navigating mainly by visual 
reference s. 
5. Neither the master nor the officer of the watch speaking up when they both 
noticed that the vessel  was to s tarboard of the track according to their passage 
plan was a lost opportunity to avert the grounding.  
6. The standard of bridge resource management on the Molly Manx  bridge leading 
up to the grounding did not me et industry good practice.  
 
  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 19 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. The grounding occurred because the bridge team , including the pilot , lost situational 
awareness and did not realise that the vessel  had deviated so far starboard of the intended 
track.   
5.2. The bridge team , including the pilot , did not realise how far the vessel  had deviated from the 
intended track because they were not monitoring the vessel 's progress  effectively  and by all 
available means.   
5.3. The pilot and the vessel's bridge team did not have a shared understanding of one common 
passage plan to the berth before the pilotage began, which meant they were not all sharing 
the same understanding of the plan.   
5.4. The vessel's ECDIS was not correctly configured for navigation in a narrow channel, which 
meant the crew were not adequately monitoring the progress of the vess el in support of the 
pilot, who was mainly navigating by visual references.  
5.5. Neither the master nor the officer of the watch speaking up when they both noticed that the 
vessel  was to starboard of the track according to their passage plan was a lost opportun ity to 
avert the grounding . 
5.6. The standard of bridge resource management on the Molly Manx  bridge leading up to the 
grounding did not meet industry good practice.   
 
  
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 20 >>
 6. Safety issues  
6.1. The vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding o f a common 
passage plan before the pilotage began.  Consequently the pilot and the vessel 's bridge team 
had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed and their respective roles in 
monitoring against the plan . 
6.2. The IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to, but there is no 
corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and use to meet those 
same standards.  
6.3. The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required  by the IMO and 
company standards when the grounding occurred . 
6.4. The standard of bridge resource management on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago 
pilotage did not meet good industry practice.

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actio ns by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Since the accident Anglo -Eastern Ship Management has:  
 briefed the master about the incident citing the importance of taking overriding action 
well in time when in doubt as to  a pilot's advice  
 promulgated the f indings of this incident to all company -managed ships and to 
company training centres by a 'One of our  ships ' report so as to create better 
awareness.    
7.3. Since the accident Port Otago has  taken the following actions : 
 all pilots have been or are being issued with their own individual PPU [ portable 
pilotage uni ts]- Currently six of the eight  pilots (including  the pilot that had the 
accident) have been issued with a Navicom Channel Pilot Mk 3 PPU  
 a virtual starboard -hand beacon is to be put in over the shoal where the Molly Manx  
ran aground. This is done through the AIS system  
 the maximum size of bulk vessel to  be allowed to navigate in the Upper Harbour is to 
be reduced from 190 metres LOA [length overall] to 180 metres (there will be a couple 
of exceptions later this year as some vessels were already under charter to the 
Ravensdown fertiliser company but we will have specific controls in place with respect 
to the use of tugs, wind and tide limits).  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
None identified .

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to Maritime New Zealand.   
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendat ions to the Director of Maritime New Zealand  
8.3. The IMO has set minimum standards and guidelines for passage planning that vessels should  
adhere to, but there is no corresponding New Zealand requirement for passage plans create d 
by port authorities  to meet those same standards .  This raises an issue for masters  of vessels  
when pilots prefer to  conduct  the navigation of the ir vessels in accordance with port -generated 
passage plan s that might  not meet the standard s that a vessel  should  comply  with. 
One method of ensuring that an approved passage plan is available on board would be for 
port authorities to make available to vessels  properly constructed and validated passage 
plans.  The majority of the passage planning guidelines contained in  Annex  24 to Chapter V of 
SOLAS can be encapsulated in a generic passage plan developed by a port authority, leaving 
only the vessel -specific considerations and 'dynamic' information such as tide and weather 
conditions to be discussed and agreed during the master/pilot  exchange.  
Such a system would assist in on-board passage planning and allow a vessel to be better 
prepared when the pilot boards.  This would greatly assist the smooth transition of the pilot 
into the bridge team at a time of typically high workload and l ittle time before the pilotage 
begins.  
On 25 October 2017  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand use the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code and its associated governance 
arrangements,  or any other appropriate mechanism , to ensure that  port authorit ies produce  
and publish passage plans f or their  respective pilotage district s that meet the port-specific 
requirements and guidelines contained in  Chapter V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to 
SOLAS  and Resolution A.893(21) Guid elines for Voyage Planning .  (029/17)  
On 10 November 2017, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
As outlined in my response to the Commission's draft recommendations, neither 
the code nor the underlying statutory framework confer on the Director a 
mechanism to ens ure that port operators or regional councils undertake specific 
activities as contemplated in this recommendation.  
However, I will, within six months of the Commission releasing its final report, 
convey this recommendation to both Port operators and Region al Councils who 
are parties to the code, for their consideration.  
Furthermore, Maritime New Zealand will advise the Commission of any response 
or comments received from Port operators and/or Regional Councils as to their 
intentions.   
8.4. More vessel s are using ECDIS s as the primary means of navigation.  This will increase in 
future.  As it was with  the Molly Manx , the pilotage plan to the berth is usually  loaded into the 
vessel s' ECDIS s. 
Currently there can be issues with uploading standardised passage pla ns into an ECDIS, 
because ECDIS manufacturers have proprietary systems that require specific formats.  
However, that will shortly change.  The International Hydrographic Organization  and the 
International Electrotechnical Commission standard for ECDIS s (IEC 61774 Edition 4, 
September 2015) from August 2017 includes a route exchange format that will make it easier 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 23 >>
 for data transfers.  In the future it will be possible to send passage plans to all vessels in the 
correct format to be uploaded direct ly into the  ECDIS system, thereby reducing the possibility 
of vessel s' navigating officers making errors when loading  into ECDIS s the passage plans 
generated by the responsible harbour authorities.  
Ideally, passage plans generated by responsible harbour authorities should be to the standard 
that is required by vessel s, and should be compatible for use in an ECDIS . 
On 25 October 2017  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand encourage responsible harbour authorities to  produce their passage plans in a format 
that will in future be capable of being directly uploaded into a vessel 's ECDIS .  (030/17)  
On 10 November 2017, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
I will convey this TAIC recommendation to Port operators and Regional Councils 
through the mechanism of the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code within six 
months of the Commission releasing its final report. Maritime New Zealand will 
advise the Commission of any response or comments received from Port 
operators and/or Regional Councils as to their intentions.  
8.5. Many vessel s transit more than one New Zealand port.  It would greatly enhance safety if the 
passage plans were, as far as practicable, in a standardi sed format and could be found at one 
site.  Vessel s routed to several New Zealand ports would be able access from one place 
standardised passage plans for several ports, even before they depart ed from their previous 
overseas port s. 
On 25 October 2017  the C ommission recommended that the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand provide a common official website where responsible harbour authorities can make 
their passage plans available for download by shipping companies and vessel  masters to 
access prior to planning  their voyages . [031/17]  
On 10 November 2017, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
As an additional service to any already provided by individual Port operators and 
Regional Councils, Maritime New Zealand will investigate through the 
mechanism of the Port and Ha rbour Marine Safety Code, providing a facility on 
its internet site for Port operators and Regional Councils who wish to make 
passage plans available for shipping companies and vessel masters to access 
prior to planning their voyages.  
The time frame to com plete this recommendation will largely depend on whether 
or not Port operators and Regional Councils choose to accept the 
recommendations above.  
In my response to the Commission's draft recommendations, I referred to the 
statutory framework within which Ma ritime New Zealand operates, and 
limitations on the Director's powers to go beyond encouraging Port operators and 
Regional Councils to take specific actions. I re -state my view that it would be 
more appropriate for the Commission to address its concern dir ectly with the 
parties that it wishes to see take action.  
8.6. In order to fully contextualize, and to be read in conjunction with his specific responses to the 
Commission's recommendations 029/17, 030/17 and 031/17, the director referred to the 
following paragraphs in response to the Commission's draft recommendations:  
Part 3A of the  Maritime Transport Act 1994 (MTA) provides for local regulation of 
maritime activity and sets out the functions and powers of regional councils and 
harbourmasters.  Under section 33C, for the purpose of ensuring maritime safety 
in their regions, regional councils may regulate ports, harbours, waters and 
maritime -related activities in their regions.  Section 33F sets out the powers of 
harbourmasters for the purposes of ensuring maritime safety, or enforcing 
navigation bylaws or regulations and rules made un der the MTA.  
While these functions and powers are in the MTA, neither the Maritime NZ 
Authority nor the Director has the power to direct or require regional councils or 
harbourmasters to take the actions that TAIC has recommended.  An alternative 
option wo uld be for the Commission to make these recommendations directly to 
the local harbour authorities.  
Final Report MO -2016 -204

 9. Key l essons  
9.1. There must be an absolute agreement and shared understanding between the vessel 's bridge 
team and the pilot as to the passage plan and monitoring  against that plan.  
9.2. Vessels ' bridge teams must actively promote and use the concept of b ridge resource 
management , including the incorporation of pilot s into the bridge team s, to manage voyage s 
properly . 
9.3. A vessel's  ECDIS is an important system for monitori ng the progress of the vessel  and warning 
the bridge team when things could go wrong.  It is essential that it be configured correctly for 
the phase of navigation and the proximity to navigation hazards .

 Appendix 3: SOLAS Chapter V , Regulation 34 Safe Navigation and  
Resolution A 893(21) Annex  
1 Prior to proceeding to sea, the master shall ensure that the intended voyage has been 
planned using the appropriate nautical charts and nautical publications for the area 
concerned, taking into account the guidelines and recommendations developed by the 
Organization.*  
2 The voyage plan shall identify a route which:  
.1 takes into account any relevant ships' routeing systems;  
.2 ensures sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage;  
.3 anticipates all known navigational hazards an d adverse weather conditions; and  
.4 takes into account the marine environmental protection measures that apply, and avoids, 
as far as possible, actions and activities which could cause damage to the environment.  
Resolution A 893(21) Annex  
DRAFT GUIDELINES  FOR VOYAGE PLANNING  
1. Objective  
1.1 The development of a plan for voyage or passage, as well as the close and continuous 
monitoring of the vessel's progress and position during the execution of such a plan, are of 
essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and 
protection of the marine environment.  
1.2  The need for voyage and passage planning applies to all vessels. There are several factors 
that may impede the safe navigation of all vessels and additional factors th at may impede 
the navigation of large vessels or vessels carrying hazardous cargoes. These factors will 
need to be taken into account in the preparation of the plan and in the subsequent 
monitoring of the execution of the plan.  
1.3  Voyage and passage plan ning includes appraisal, i.e. gathering all information relevant to 
the contemplated voyage or passage; detailed planning of the whole voyage or passage 
from berth to berth, including those areas necessitating the presence of a pilot; execution 
of the plan ; and the monitoring of the progress of the vessel in the implementation of the 
plan. These components of voyage/passage planning are analysed below.  
 
2. Appraisal  
2.1 All information relevant to the contemplated voyage or passage should be considered. The 
following items should be taken into account in voyage and passage planning:  
1. .1 the condition and state of the vessel, its stability, and its equipment; any operational 
limitations; its permissible draught at sea in fairways20 and in ports; its manoeuvring 
data, including any restrictions;  
2. .2 any special characteristics of the cargo (especially if hazardous), and its distribution, 
stowage and securing on board the vessel;  
3. .3 the provision of a competent and well -rested crew to undertake the voyage or 
passag e;  
                                                        
20 Navigable  water in a channel, harbour or river . 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 31 >>
 4. .4 requirements for up -to-date certificates and documents concerning the vessel, its 
equipment, crew, passengers or cargo;  
5. .5 appropriate scale, accurate and up -to-date charts to be used for the intended voyage 
or passage, as well as any relevant permanent or temporary notices to mariners and 
existing radio navigational warnings;  
6. .6 accurate and up -to-date sailing directions,  lists of lights and lists of radio aids to 
navigation; and  
7. .7 any relevant up -to-date additional information, including:  
.1 mariners' routeing guides and passage planning charts, published by competent 
authorities;  
.2 current and tidal atlases and tide tables;  
.3 climatological, hydrographical, and oceanographic data as well as other appropriate 
meteorological information;  
.4 availability of services for weather routeing (such as that contained in Volume D of 
the World Meteorological Organization's Pub lication No. 9);  
.5 existing ships' routeing and reporting systems, vessel traffic services, and marine 
environmental protection measures;  
.6 volume of traffic likely to be encountered throughout the voyage or passage;  
.7 if a pilot is to be used, infor mation relating to pilotage and embarkation and 
disembarkation including the exchange of information between master and pilot;  
.8 available port information, including information pertaining to the availability of 
shore -based emergency response arrangemen ts and equipment; and  
.9 any additional items pertinent to the type of the vessel or its cargo, the particular 
areas the vessel will traverse, and the type of voyage or passage to be undertaken.  
2.2  On the basis of the above information, an overall appr aisal of the intended voyage or 
passage should be made. This appraisal should provide a clear indication of all areas of 
danger; those areas where it will be possible to navigate safely, including any existing 
routeing or reporting systems and vessel traff ic services; and any areas where marine 
environmental protection considerations apply.  
3. Planning  
3.1 On the basis of the fullest possible appraisal, a detailed voyage or passage plan should be 
prepared which should cover the entire voyage or passage from be rth to berth, including 
those areas where the services of a pilot will be used.  
3.2  The detailed voyage or passage plan should include the following factors:  
8. .1 the plotting of the intended route or track of the voyage or passage on appropriate 
scale char ts: the true direction of the planned route or track should be indicated, as well 
as all areas of danger, existing ships' routeing and reporting systems, vessel traffic 
services, and any areas where marine environmental protection considerations apply;  
9. .2 the main elements to ensure safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation, 
and protection of the marine environment during the intended voyage or passage; such 
elements should include, but not be limited to:  
.1 safe speed, having regard to the proximity of navigational hazards along the intended 
route or track, the manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel and its draught in 
relation to the available water depth;  
.2 necessary speed alterations en route, e.g.,  where there may be limitations because of 
night passage, tidal restrictions, or allowance for the increase of draught due to 
squat and heel effect when turning;  
.3 minimum clearance required under the keel in critical areas with restricted water 
depth;  
.4 positions where a change in machinery status is required;  
.5 course alteration points, taking into account the vessel's turning circle at the planned 
speed and any expected effect of tidal streams and currents;  
Final Report MO -2016 -204 
<< Page 32 >>
 .6 the method and frequency of position fixing, including primary and secondary 
options, and the indication of areas where accuracy of position fixing is critical and 
where maximum reliability must be obtained;  
.7 use of ships' routeing and reporting systems and vessel traffic services;  
.8 con siderations relating to the protection of the marine environment; and  
.9 contingency plans for alternative action to place the vessel in deep water or proceed 
to a port of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of any emergency necessitating 
abandonment of  the plan, taking into account existing shore -based emergency 
response arrangements and equipment and the nature of the cargo and of the 
emergency itself.  
3.3 The details of the voyage or passage plan should be clearly marked and recorded, as 
appropriate, on charts and in a voyage plan notebook or computer disk.  
3.4  Each voyage or passage plan as well as the details of the plan, should be approved by the 
ships' master prior to the commencement of the voyage or passage.  
4. Execution  
4.1  Having finalized the voyage or passage plan, as soon as time of departure and estimated 
time of arrival can be determined with reasonable accuracy, the voyage or passage should 
be executed in accordance with the plan or any changes made thereto.  
4.2  Factors which should be t aken into account when executing the plan, or deciding on any 
departure therefrom include:  
.1 the reliability and condition of the vessel's navigational equipment;  
.2 estimated times of arrival at critical points for tide heights and flow;  
.3 meteorologi cal conditions, (particularly in areas known to be affected by frequent 
periods of low visibility) as well as weather routeing information;  
.4 daytime versus night -time passing of danger points, and any effect this may have on 
position fixing accuracy; an d  
.5 traffic conditions, especially at navigational focal points.  
4.3  It is important for the master to consider whether any particular circumstance, such as the 
forecast of restricted visibility in an area where position fixing by visual means at a crit ical 
point is an essential feature of the voyage or passage plan, introduces an unacceptable 
hazard to the safe conduct of the passage; and thus whether that section of the passage 
should be attempted under the conditions prevailing or likely to prevail. T he master should 
also consider at which specific points of the voyage or passage there may be a need to 
utilize additional deck or engine room personnel.  
5. Monitoring  
5.1  The plan should be available at all times on the bridge to allow officers of the navigational 
watch immediate access and reference to the details of the plan.  
5.2  The progress of the vessel in accordance with the voyage and passage plan should be 
closely  and continuously monitored. Any changes made to the plan should be made 
consistent with these Guidelines and clearly marked and recorded.

 Appendix 5: Excerpts from Anglo -Eastern  Ship Management 's shipboard 
procedures manual  
3.2 PASSAGE PLANNING AND VOYAGE EXECUTION  
3.2.1  Passage Planning  
3.2.1.1.  The objective of planning is to make an appraisal of the hazards  involved in advance 
and establish the most favourable route whilst maintaining appropriate margins of 
safety.  
3.2.1.2.  Passage plan shall be made berth to berth, including areas under pilotage.  
The Master is responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive passage plan is made 
and executed. He may delegate the Second Officer or other Navigating Officers to 
prepare the passage plan for the voyage.  
3.2.1.3.  Passage planning is a fundamental part of operat ing a vessel safely and hence prior to 
departure from a berth, as much of the plan must be completed as is possible. If the 
entire plan  cannot be completed prior to sailing, the ship may depart provided that the 
first part of the passage plan has been comp leted. The remainder plan must be 
completed as soon as possible after sailing. …  
3.2.13.8  Passage Planning on Electronic Charts:   Marking/ highlighting of electronic charts can 
be carried out in a similar way to paper charts to identify radar conspicuous  targets, 
no-go areas, parallel index lines (essential for the monitoring stage), transit marks, 
clearing bearings, etc.  
It is prudent for a simulated passage to be run prior to the vessel's departure to 
ensure that the route does not enter any alarm preset danger areas that may 
have been overlooked. Estimated positions should be marked on both paper and 
electronic chart for each watch, in advance.  
3.2.14.7  Execution  and Monitoring  on electronic  charts:  Navigating  officers  must  not become 
over-reliant on ECDIS. Frequent checks should be made of the ECDIS position fixing 
system (normally GPS) by the use of other means. Such checks should  include:  
• Use of radar to check the accuracy of the charted position by 
comparing the location of the radar target against  the charted  symbol;  
• Visual cross bearings;  
The full functionality of ECDIS cannot be achieved when operating in the raster 
chart21 display (RCDS) mode and thus the system should always be operated in 
ECDIS mode. Data input from the gyrocompass, speed log, echo sounder and 
other electronic equipment should be periodically monitored to ensure accuracy.  
3.2.17.4  The bridge team meeting is extremely important for preventing accidents. Master must 
motivate and promote a culture of avoiding human errors by going through the passage 
plan seriously and officers must question  each other and question the master if there are 
any doubts about saf ety. The company strongly recommends a de -briefing be 
conducted upon completion of passage and any important information forwarded to 
the office.

 3.5.3  Bridge Resource Management  
In spite of adequate training of individual officers, accidents sometimes o ccur 
due to the bridge team not functioning well together.  
Bridge (Marine) Resource Management (BRM) is the effective use of the bridge 
team and the creation of an environment where "one-person error " is eliminated.  
3.5.3.1  ASSIGNMENTS AND DUTIES  
Each vessel should employ a bridge  resource management system for vessel 
navigation, collision avoidance, and bridge administration.  
The specific duties described  below shall be applicable: Additional lookouts may be 
required depending upon the circumstances of the case, including but not limited 
to the seaman on watch being utilized for hand steering. (Cadets and trainees shall 
not form a part of the bridge watch structure other than for training purposes).

3.5.3.2  PROCEDURES FOR NAVIGATING WITH A PILOT  
The pilot is an important  part of the Bridge team.  
The officers  and Master  must make utmost efforts to function as one team with 
the pilot. Procedures stated under 'Navigation with the Pilot on Board' should be 
followed.  
3.5.3.3  RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES IN EMERGENCIES  
In case of emergencies  the Master must be called to the bridge immediately. The 
procedures given in the Emergency Manual must be followed.  
3.5.3.4  GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES  
The primary goal of all watch officers is to function cohesively, and support each

 other so that errors of any one person do not create a hazardous situation and the 
same are brought to notice and rectified well in time.  
The bridge team shall achieve this by : 
• Discussion of passage  plan  
• Considering the maneuvering characteristics of vessel  
• Bridge Team I Pilot Information  exchange  
• Creation of a Team  environment  
• Recognition and handling of stress or  distractions  
3.5.3.5  COMMUNICATIONS  
The IMO Recommended Standard Marine Communication Phrases shall be used in 
all cases where simple English communication is  not possible.  
Verbal orders for steering/ engine movements etc. must be repeated (closed loop) 
to ensure that they have been correctly understood.  
3.5.3.6  REASSIGNMENT OF TASKS  
In case of the Master being incapacitated the chief officer shall take over 
command of the bridge. The bridge team should  be familiar with, and capable 
of taking over, each other's tasks.

 Appendix 6 : Extracts from New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safet y Code  
Port passage planning and guidance  
The purpose of port passage planning and guidance is to ensure that everyone involved in  the 
movement of ships in the harbour:  
 has a clear, shared understanding of potential hazards, margins of safety, and the  ship's 
characteristics;   
 has agreed on the intentions and required actions for the conduct of the port  passage, including 
the use of tugs and their availability, and any significant deviation  should it become necessary;  
 knows relevant details of any partic ular port passage in advance.  
The Harbourmaster will promote the use of port passage planning and ensure guidance is  available. As 
a minimum, passage planning should apply to all ships that take a pilot or are  under the conduct of a 
Pilot Exemption Certifi cate (PEC) holder. Where a ship takes a pilot,  the passage plan will be used in 
conjunction with the master/pilot exchange.  
The risk assessment for the port and harbour may indicate that passage plans are not  needed for all 
ships, for example recreational craft. However, if it is necessary or practicable,  passage planning can 
still be required for such craft.  
Passage plan guidance is usually developed by the port operator in consultation with the  Harbourmaster 
and pilotage provider. Guidance should focus on  critical port movements and  cover matters such as:  
 entry to the port;   
 entry to specific berths - for example the movement of deep draught ships to a  particular berth;  
 ship sizes and cargoes;   
 prevailing conditions and tidal constraints;   
 tug allocation;   
 holding areas; and   
 recommended tracks, as appropriate.  
Up-to-date passage plans and guidance should be published, and be available to harbo ur users and the 
masters of visiting ships.  
Plans adopted for particular passages are recorded. The pilot and the m aster of the ship  keep records 
of their port passage plans in case they are needed for an accident  investigation.  
Port passage plans may change if a pilot needs to react to unforeseen circumstances. Any  changes 
must first be dis cussed with the master of the ship and, if relevant, with the harbo ur radio service. The 
reasons for any change will be recorded.
