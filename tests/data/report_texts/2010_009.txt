The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly i t is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault 
or blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of 
implementing any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is 
a matter for the regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas.  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoidin g similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by in forming members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. General  
1.1.1.  On 4 September 2010  the pilot of a Walter Fletcher aeroplane with 8 parachutists on board 
lost control during take -off from Fox Glacier aerodrome.  The aeroplane crashed in a paddock 
adjacent to the runway, killing all 9 occupants.   
1.1.2.  The Walter Fletcher had b een modified from an agricultural aeroplane into a  parachut e-drop 
aeroplane some 3 months before the accident.  The modification  to the aircraft  had been 
poorly managed , and discrepancies in the aeroplane's documentation had not been detected 
by the New Ze aland  Civil Aviation Authority  (CAA) , which  had approved the change in category.  
1.1.3.  The new owner and operator of the aeroplane had not complete d any weight and balance 
calculations  on the aeroplane before it entered service , nor at any time before the accident .  
As a result the aeroplane was being flown outside its loading  limits every time it carried a full 
load of 8 parachutists.  On the accident flight  the centre of gravity of the aeroplane was well 
rear of its aft limit and it became airborne at too  low a speed to be controllable .  The pilot was 
unable to regain control and the aeroplane continued to pitch up , then rolled left before 
striking  the ground nearly vertically.  
1.2. Recommendations  
1.2.1.  The Commission  made 6 recommendations to the Director of Civil Aviation . Three related to 
the operation of parachute -drop  aircraft, 2 related to the process for converting aircraft for 
another purpose and one related to seat restraints.  A recommendation was made to the 
Secretary  for Transport regarding the need for a dr ug and alcohol detection and deterrence 
regime  for the various transport modes.  
1.3. Key lessons  
1.3.1.  The investigation findings and recommendations provided reminders of the following practices 
that contribute to aviation safet y: 
 no 2 aircraft of the same model are exactly the same , even if they look that way; 
therefore pilots must do weight and balance calculations for every individual a ircraft  
 modifying aircraft is a safety -critical process that must be done in strict accordan ce with 
rules and guidelines and with appropriate regulatory oversight  
 good rules, regulations and recommended practices are key to ensuring safe commercial 
aviation operations  
 operators need to ensure that aircraft are being operated in accordance with pr escribed 
rules and guidelines, and flown within their operating limitations  
 aircraft operations need to be accompanied by relevant and robust procedures  
 maintaining flight safety requires active participation and a co -ordinated approach by all 
sectors of t he industry.

 Report 10 -009 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was notified of the accident at 
1410 on Saturday 4 September 2010.  An investigation team was assembled at Christchurch 
on the Sunday morning and arrived at Fox Glacier township at 1645, where they were briefed 
by Police before commencing the site examination. On 8 September, on completion of the site 
examination, the wreckage of ZK -EUF was removed to Commission facilities for further 
examination and security.  
2.2. Approximately 15 witnesses, many of them local residents who had observed the accident 
sequence or portions of it, were interviewed b y the Commission 's investigation team .  The 
owner  of the aeroplane and a business partner in the parachuting operation provided 
background information to the investigation.  The manufacturer of the aeroplane and the 
company involved in the original modific ation of the aeroplane and subsequen t parachuting 
conversion also provided extensive background information on ZK -EUF.     
2.3. The Walter Fletcher aeroplane was a New Zealand  manufactured and certificated aeroplane 
primarily used in agricultural operations.  E xtensive modifications had therefore been required 
to convert the aeroplane for parachuting.  Commercial parachuting activities formed part of 
the fast -growing adventure aviation industry in New Zealand and at the time of the accident 
regulations were bein g developed to better manage the industry.  For these reasons t he CAA 
provided information crucial to the investigation . 
2.4. In September and October 2010 the investigator s held meetings with various CAA staff, 
including the managers of General Aviation, Safet y Information  and Sports and Recreation, 
and several airworthiness engineers and other staff with knowledge of ZK -EUF or the Walter 
Fletcher.  On 10 December 2010 the Chief Commissioner visited the manufacturer of the 
Fletcher FU24 aeroplane on a general f amiliarisation visit, and met with senior management.  
On 17 February 2011 a series of follow -up questions was forwarded to the CAA regarding the 
modification of ZK -EUF and parachuting operations.  On 6 April 201 1 the CAA provided written 
responses to the questions.   
2.5. On 18 July 2011 the Commission met with the CAA's manager of Health and Safety with the 
objective of confirming the CAA's responsibilities under the H ealth and Safety in Employment  
Act 1992  (HSE Act) , and its application to commercial parachuting generally and the operator 
of ZK -EUF specifically.  
2.6. A consulting engineer, who was also a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer , was engaged 
to provide technical advice.  The engineer was familiar with aircraf t modification and 
certification processes.  
2.7. On 11 November 2010 the Commission published an interim factual report on the accident.  
The interim factual report included 2 urgent recommendations to the Director of Civil Aviation 
regarding the operation of the Fletcher FU24 -954 for parachuting.   
2.8. On 14 October 2011 the Commission approved a draft final report, which was sent to 
interested persons for comment.  Several submissions were received  and these have been 
considered and the report amended where appro priate.  
2.9. This final report includes more  factual information  than the interim report ; an analysis of that 
information ; findings ; and further recommendations.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  At about 1230 on Saturday 4 September 2010, 8 passengers from a tour group arrived at  the 
Fox Glacier aerodrome facilities of Skydive N ew Zealand  Limited  (the operator )2 in preparation 
for a tandem skydive jump.  The passengers were divided into 2 groups of 4. Each passenger 
in the first group was allocated a tandem ma ster and taken aside and briefed in preparation 
for their jump.  
3.1.2.  The aeroplane to be used for the flight was a Walter Fletcher FU24, registration ZK -EUF.  The 
pilot for the flight had flown 9 flights that morning , totalling about 3.6 hours , before stopping 
for a lunch break of abou t 45 minutes.  During this time the pilot shutdown the engine and 
refuelled the aircraft to a total fuel load of about 160 litres.  This was described by the 
aeroplane owner  as the standard fuel load for such a  flight.  To facilitate the refuel , the 
aeroplane was parked on the side of the runway near the refuel tanker , with the right main 
wheel about 3 metres (m)  off the edge of the sealed portion of the runway. A further 6 flights 
were planned for the afternoon.  The weather was fine, with no wind or significant cloud.  
3.1.3.  At about 1320, in preparation for the first post -lunch flight , the pilot re -boarded the a eroplane  
and started the engine.  Each tandem master then led their passenger  (referred to as  a 
tandem rider in C ivil Aviation Rules  Part 105 )3 to the a eroplane  and boarded.  Once they were 
seated on the floor in the rear of the a eroplane , the tandem masters attached themselves to 
their passenger s via 4 -point harness es.  It was normal practi ce for the first 2 tandem pairs to 
sit as far forward as possible , facing rearwards  with the tandem masters ' back s against the 
bulkhead behind the pilot.   The third  pair would sit at the back  of the rear compartment  area 
against the rear bulkhead and right side of the aeroplane facing forward.  The last tandem pair 
would sit op posite the door and would be the first to exit  (see Figure 1) . 
3.1.4.  After the last pair had been  loaded and the door closed, the pilot taxied forward a few metres  
onto the runway before increasing power to commence  the take -off roll.  The take -off was 
witnessed in part or fully by about 10 people , including several local pilots, most of whom were 
located about the operator's facilities at the end of the runway.  Several witnesses were 
positioned to one side of, and about halfway down , the runway and saw the latter stages of 
the take -off.  The take -off was not recorded on video or photographed  by any of the witnesses 
or persons on  board.   
3.1.5.  Witness accounts varied in detail, but they generally described the aeroplane a ccelerating 
normally down the airstrip and getting airborne at about, but certainly not later than , the usual 
position.  Two local witnesses standing near the operator's facilities at the end of the runway , 
and who were familiar with ZK -EUF taking off from  the Fox Glacier runway, thought the 
aeroplane got airborne earlier than it normally did. The aeroplane was then seen to continue 
pitching upward until it appeared to be almost vertical.  At about 100m the aeroplane  entered 
what was described as a wing -over to the left to point almost vertically downwards . 
3.1.6.  Some witnesses recounted that the aeroplane started to manoeuvre out of the dive before the 
left wing lowered further and the aeroplane struck  the ground in about a near -vertical attitude.  
Several witnesses reported that a fine mist or vapour shrouded the aeroplane on impact and 
this immediately erupted into flames. Numerous witnesses ran to the aeroplane to render 
assistance, but were unable to do so owing  to the intensi ty of the fire.  All occupants died in 
the accident.  Emergency services were notified of the accident at 1327 and the local fire 
brigade vehicle arrived at the scene several minutes later.  
 
                                                        
2 Skydive New Zealand consisted of 2 elements - the parachuting operator supported by the aeroplane owner.  The aeroplane owner 
provided the operator, who was a tandem master, with the aircraft and pilots.  The accident aircraft was flown by one of 2 pi lots: either 
the owner himself or the pilot who was flying ZK -EUF at the time of the accident.  The terms operator, aeroplane owner and pilot are 
used in this report to identify the 3 parties.  
3 Civil Aviation Rules are identified by a Part number and topic, for  example Civil Aviation Rule Part 105 Parachuting - Operating Rules, 
and thereafter termed "Rule Part (number)".

3.2. Site and impa ct information  
Accident site  
3.2.1.  The accident site was in a grassed paddock adjacent to the Fox Glacier aerodrome  (see Figure 
2).  The aerodrome consisted of a single runway aligned about 265° magnetic .  The runway 
sloped up to the east , which restrict ed take-offs to a west erly direction and landings to an 
easterly direction .  The first approximately 400m of the runway, starting from the operator's 
buildings at the eastern end, were  of bitumen constructio n.  A further approximately 360 m of 
grass were  avail able if required. The wreckage of ZK -EUF was found 100m south of the 
runway and about 200m past the end of the bitumen section of runway  (see Figure 3) . 
Wreckage information  
3.2.2.  Ground marks and aeroplane deformation were consistent with the aeroplane striking  the 
ground in a near -vertical attitude, on a heading of about 325° magnetic.  Clear ground 
indentations made by the left wing and the separation of the left wing tip indicated  that the 
left wing tip had impacted before the right wing.  
3.2.3.  The f uselage  forward  of the wing had separated and was lying upright where it had hit the 
ground.  The propeller had separated from the engine and was buried about 0. 5m into the 
ground below the engine.  A probable slight left rotation of the fuselage on impact had thrown 
the fuselage and empennage (tail assembly ) some 10m to the east of the forward section.   
3.2.4.  An intense fire had severely damaged most of the aeroplane and destroyed  much of the 
fuselage and the inner sections of the wings.  However, a ll the aeroplane components, 
including flight controls, cables and linkages, and other flight -critical items, with the exception 
of the control lock, were able to be accounted for at the site.  The 4 fuel tanks, normally 
located along the leading edge of the wings, had been ejected fr om the aeroplane and were 
grossly  deformed by compression.  The smell of fuel was still evident at the site for several 
days afterwards  and the surrounding grass had started to brown -off due to fuel spillage .  The 
cockpit area, engine, propeller and empenna ge were recovered and transported to a secure 
facility for detailed examination.  

 
Report 10 -009

 3.2.5.  The elevator control and elevator trim c omponents  displayed no evidence of binding or fraying.  
The elevator trim was manual ly cont rolled by the pilot rotating a h andle on the left wall of the 
cockpit.  A direct m echanical linkage from the handle to a screw jack in the empennage 
moved the trim .  The position s of the handle and screw jack were consist ent with the trim 
having been  set to the nearly full full-forward or nose -down t rim position at  the time of impact.  
The trim assembly in the empennage displayed no evidence of binding and the trim was able 
to be moved in both directions.  Refer paragraph 3. 5.4 for further information on the trim 
system.

3.2.6.  The instrument panel had been severely damaged and deformed during the impact sequence.  
The control lock  support bracket , located  at the bottom of the instrument panel forward of the 
pilot, was damaged and the control lock was missing .  The 2 locating hol es through which the 
control lock would normally be held were torn open.  The direction of the tear was down and 
forward.

 Report 10 -009 3.2.7.  The 3 -bladed propeller had broken from its attachment to the engine  on impact and displayed 
a progressive bending of each of the blad es.  The fracturing of the propeller attachment and 
the nature of the bending were consistent with the engine driving the propeller at about its 
normal operating speed at the time of impact.  There was no evidence of any mechanical 
failure other than a gross overload  failure of components  at the time of impact. Witnesses did 
not report any unusual noises or lack of noise  that could indicate  that an engine malfunction  
had occurred during the take -off sequence.  
3.2.8.  The pilot was found in the cockpit.  The 4 tandem masters and 4 passengers were found 
about the fuselage area and were  still harnessed in pairs as expected .   
3.3. Operator information  
3.3.1.  The parachuting operat ion at Fox Glacier consisted of 2 elements . Skydive Ne w Zealand  was 
owned by a tandem master who had an agreement with the owner of ZK -EUF to provide an 
aeroplane and pilot.  The operator and aeroplane owner had first started carrying parachutists 
in mid -1997 , flying  out of Hokitika.  
3.3.2.  In October 1997 the opera tor relocated to Fox Glacier to better cater for tour groups of 
generally younger people who travelled along the West Coast and South Westland, and stayed 
overnight at either Franz Josef Glacier or Fox Glacier.  The aeroplane owner  initially flew a 
Cessna 180 before purchasing a more powerful Cessna 185 aeroplane.   
3.3.3.  In late 2009, as a result of increased patronage and local noise abatement considerations , 
the operator and aeroplane owner started looking for a turbine -powered aeroplane as a 
replacement for t he Cessna 185.  The aeroplane operator purchased ZK -EUF i n February 
2010.  
3.3.4.  The operator specialised in tandem parachute descents and advertised being able to carry up 
to 4 passengers at a time.  Typical parachute -drop  altitudes ranged from 9000 feet (about 
2700m) up to 12 000 feet (about 3700m), to a maximum of 16 000 feet  (about 4800 m) .  
There were normally 7 tandem masters available , so nearly continuous operations were 
possible, with refuels being done between each flight.  
3.3.5.  At the time of the accident, the pilot and aeroplane owner  were writing standard operating 
procedures for ZK -EUF.  The draft document was titled "Pilot General Handling and 
Operational Notes for operating ZK -EUF", and contained information on ground handli ng, 
refuelling and climb, drop and descent profiles.  They also had in their possession a copy of 
the "general procedures and policies " from another operator that also flew a Walter Fletcher 
on parachute flights.    
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The pilot , aged 33 , had obtained his private pilot licence (aeroplane) in July 2001 and 
commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) in September 2002.  He held a current class 1 medical 
certificate  with no recorded medical restrictions or conditions . His last medical examination 
was completed on 16 October 2009.  
3.4.2.  The pilot had gained his parachut e-drop  qualification on 20 March 2003 .4  In June 2004, after 
initially flying piston -powered parachuting aeroplanes , he obtained his b asic gas turbine 
knowledge qualification and started flying the turbo prop -powered Pilatus PC -6 Turbo -Porter 
aeroplane  as well.  In May 2007 he moved to Glenorchy , near Queenstown, flying both piston - 
and turboprop -powered parachuting a eroplanes.  
3.4.3.  On 1 June 2009 the pilot joined the operator at Fox  Glacier.  The pilot shared the parachute -
drop  pilot duties with the aeroplane owner , flying a Cessna C185 aeroplane.  The pilot was 
domiciled in Queenstown but would  travel  to Fox Glacier when the weather was considered 
suitable for parachuting operations .

curre ncy requirements for pilots.  
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 7 >>
 3.4.4.  On 11 May 2010 the pilot , together with the aeroplane owner , completed a type rating for the 
Walter Fletcher aeroplane.  The rating was completed in ZK-DJE, another Walter Fletcher that 
was fitted with dual flight contr ols to facilitate instruction.  
3.4.5.  The type rating included a technical review of the aircraft, the completion of a questionnaire 
covering aeroplane operating limitations and general knowledge, and 5 flights with an 
instructor.  The pilot's rating took 1.6 flying hours and included 4 parachut e-drop flights and 
30 minutes of circuit work.  Several weight and balance checks were completed in conjunction 
with the flights.  The instructor who conducted his training commented that the pilot's 
extensive experience on another turboprop aeroplane enabl ed him to learn  quickly  to handle 
the Walter Fletcher.  
3.4.6.  At the time of the accident on 4 September 2010 , the pilot had accrued 4554 flying hours, 
including 4 1 hours on the Walter Fletcher.   His previous  biennial flight review had been  
completed on 2 August 2010.  
3.4.7.  Adverse weather conditions prevented any parachuting  activities in the 2 days before the 
accident.  Witness es reported that during the  evening preceding the accident  the pilot , who 
was anticipati ng a full day 's flying, did not drink any alcohol and retired  early to his 
accommodation .  Witnesses who knew him said that o n Saturday  4 September the pilot was 
his normal self and appeared to be in good health.  
3.4.8.  The aeroplane owner , aged 58, had obtained his commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) in 
November 1992 and his basic turbine knowledge rating on 25 March 2010.  He held a current 
class 1 medical certificate . He had accrued some 5900 flying hours, including about 45 hours 
on the Walter Fletch er. 
3.4.9.  The 4 tandem masters were all experienced parachutists who had completed between 4600 
and more than  13 000 jumps each.  One of the tandem masters was the owner of the 
parachuting operation , while 2 others had worked for the parachuting operator for between  3 
and 4 years.  The fourth tandem master had worked for the parachuting operator for about 3 
months.  All tandem masters held current medical certificates and tandem master ratings  
issued by the New Zealand Parachuting Industry Association  (NZPIA) . Like the pilot, most of 
the tandem masters resided away from Fox Glacier , and would return when the weather was 
considered suitable for parachuting operations.  
3.4.10.  The 4 passengers were from Australia, England, the Republic of Germany and the Republic of 
Ireland, and  members of a larger group that was touring the South Island.  
Medical and pathological information  
3.4.11.  Post-mortem examinations of the pilot and 8 tandem masters and passengers showed that 
they all had sustained "extreme fatal or mortal injuries in  the impact ". Toxicology results for 
the pilot were unremarkable and identified no substances that would have affected his 
judgement or ability to control the aeroplane.  Toxicology testing of the tandem masters gave a 
positive result for ∆9-tetrahydrocann abinol (THC) for 2 of them.  For one of them, the level was 
found to be 5 micrograms per litre of blood and was considered by the pathologist to be 
consistent with that person having consumed the equivalent of a single cannabis cigarette 
within 3 hours of the accident.  The amount of THC found in the blood of the other tandem 
master was too low to quantify.

 Report 10 -009 3.5. Aircraft information  
3.5.1.  ZK-EUF had been  manufactured in New Zealand in 1980 by Pacific Aerospace Industries, later 
Pacific Aerospace Limited, as a Fletcher FU24 -954 model aeroplane, serial number 281.  The 
aeroplane was powered initially by a Lycoming IO -720-A1B piston engine and was certificate d 
by the CAA in the restricted airworthiness category5 for agricultural topdressing operations.  
Flight controls  
3.5.2.  The Fletcher aeroplane was equipped with conventional flight co ntrols.  Directional control on 
the ground was by a steerable nose  wheel connected to the rudder pedals. Pitch control was 
achieved through elevators fitted to the empennage .6  The elevator was connected by cables 
running through a number of pulleys to the pilot's stick or control column (see Figure 4). 
Pulling back on the cont rol column pitched the nose up and pushing forward on the control 
column pitched the nose down  relative to the pilot .  The amount and rate of any change in 
pitch were  dependent on how much the pilot moved the control column or stick and the 
airspeed of the  aeroplane.  For a given amount of control input, t he faster the aeroplane was 
flying , the greater would be the change in pitch attitude . 
Figure 4 
Fletcher flight control systems (Courtesy of Pacific Aerospace Limited)  
3.5.3.  To prevent the controls moving about when the aeroplane was unattended, a control lock was 
fitted below the instrument panel in front of the pilot's seat (see Figure 5).  To lock the 
controls, the control column would be moved fully forward to sit in a pro truding "H" shaped 
bracket that would be pulled out from below the instrument panel.  A pin would be inserted 
through 2 holes in the bracket to hold the control column i n place. Soon after the accident the 
aeroplane owner commented that he never used the c ontrol lock between flights and the pilot 
used a bungee cord to hold the control column forward when getting in and out of the cockpit.  
  
                                                        
5 There were 3 types of airworthiness category: standard, restricted and special.  See the Glossary for more information.  
6 All-moving elevators or tailplanes, like those installed on the FU24, are also called "stabilators", a combination of the words stabiliser 
and elevator.  

 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 9 >>
 3.5.4.  An elevator trim system was fitted  to assist the pilot and ease elevator control forces when 
operati ng in a range of speeds and loading conditions.  Fletcher aeroplanes had either 
electrically or manually operated trim controls.  The trim control for ZK -EUF was manual, with a 
rotating handle located on the left side of the cockpit, aft of the power -contr ol lever (see Figure 
6).  The trim could therefore be moved with the pilot's left hand while at the same time the 
right hand  held the control column .  The trim took about 25 turns of the handle  for full travel . 
.

<< Page 10 >>
 Report 10 -009 3.5.5.  The elevator trim worked in the natural sense, in that the trim would be moved in the direction 
in which the pilot was applying the required force.  For example, with a rear centre of gravity 
the nose of an aeroplane would want to pitch up , so the pilot would apply forward elevator by 
pushing forward on the control column.  The forward pressure could be relieved by the pilot 
winding forward on the trim handle.  It is normal  practice  to set the trim before take -off to 
balance the  anticipated load that would come on the control column once the aeroplane 
became airborne . 
3.5.6.  The aeroplane owner  reported that with 3 and especially 4 tandem pairs the aeroplane was 
tail-heavy, meaning the weight was concentrated towards the rear of the aeroplane.  Ther efore 
the normal take -off configuration consisted of 2 notches of flap7 and the elevator trim set 
between ¾ and fully forward.  The landing configuration was normally 2 notches of flap and 
elevator trim set about 2/3 aft. 
3.5.7.  The aeroplane owner  recalled that about 2 weeks before the accident the pilot had rejected a 
take-off part -way down the runway and returned to the loading area before taking off 
successfully on the second attempt.  The pilot had later said that he had forgotten to reset the 
elevator trim f or take -off after the previous landing.  The error was detected early in the take -
off roll so he had stopped the take -off, returned to the start point and reset the trim before 
taking  off.  As a result of the incident the operator placed a label  on the ins trument panel to 
remind the pilots to check the trim position before take -off. 
3.6. Civil Aviation Rules and the Regulator  
Aircraft  modifications  
3.6.1.  The CAA issued type certificate s8 for approved aircraft types manufactured in New Zealand.  
Exceptions included experimental  and homebuilt aircraft, and other isolated examples.  For 
aircraft designed overseas, the CAA generally accepted the type certificate s issued by the 
State s-of-Design, thus ensuring direct access to continuing airworthiness information.  The 
CAA was responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of New Zealand -manufactured aircraft 
before issuing type certificate s.  The type certificate issued for the Fletcher FU24 series of 
aeroplanes permitted the aeroplane s to be categorised in either the standar d or the restricted 
categor y of airworthiness.  
3.6.2.  The t ype acceptance process was important to provide the CAA with the operating and 
maintenance data that was essential to support and control the operation of an aircraft, 
engine or propeller type.  It also enabled the CAA to have access to and promulgate applicable 
airworthiness requirements, called airworthiness directives, for the type.  Any major changes 
to the type therefore needed some level of  CAA involvement depending on the scope  of the 
project, as outlined below . 
3.6.3.  A change to the form or function of an a ircraft or other aviation product could be  achieved and 
approved  by one of  the following methods : 
a. Changes to the type certificate  
b. Supplemental type certificate s (STCs)  
c. Repairs  
d. Modifications.  
Type certificates  
3.6.4.  A change in type certificate  was likely to be required for a change in type certificate  category or 
type design.  Such a change  might have also included new operating limitations, for example 
new power or speed limitations.  A change in type certificate  was the most complex  of the 4 
processes and required CAA review and final approval by the Director of Civil Aviation.   
                                                        
7 The flap lever operated in a similar manner to a traditional car handbrake.  By pulling up on the handle the pilot was able t o select one 
of the 3 flap settings available, with full flap being 3 notches.  
8 Also includes type acceptance certificates.  
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 11 >>
 Supplemental type certificates  
3.6.5.  STCs could be  issued where design changes were not significant enough to require a change 
to the type certificate .  They could be proposed by anyone , but still required approval by the 
Director.  R ule Part 21, Subpart E prescribed the rules  and responsibilities for the issue of a n 
STC (CAA, 2009 ).  The approval of a n STC also permitted numerous aircraft to be modified, 
and enable d the holder of the STC to gain royalties by on -selling the approved technical data 
to enable the modification.  That data could  include drawings , changes in the flight manual 
and additional maintenance  requirements for the aircraft.  
3.6.6.  In October 1998 the Fletcher FU24 aeroplane was modified under STC 98/21E/15 with the 
installation of a Walter M601D -11 turbine engine.   ZK-EUF was the first Fletcher aircraft to be 
converted by Turbine Conversions Limited, a company later purchased by Super Air Limited 
(the engineering company)  and that was involved in the certification programme for the STC.  
A total of 24 FU24 -950 and -954 aeroplanes were converted under the STC and the aeroplane 
type typically became known as the Walter Fletcher.  At the time of the accident, 17 Walter 
Fletchers were still on the Civil Aviation Register, with 4 of them ( including  ZK-EUF) used for 
parac huting operations.  
3.6.7.  As the Walter Fletcher became more common , there were several accidents involving pilots 
who had not long before gained their aircraft type rating s.  The CAA determined that the 
primary cause of these accidents was pilots being unfamilia r with the operation of the turbine -
propeller combination, in particular the use of reverse thrust on approach to land.  In about 
April 2000 the CAA and the engineering company , in an attempt to reduce the accident rate, 
inserted an amendment into the flig ht manual for the Walter Fletcher.  The amendment stated 
that:  
Because of the extensive changes to the original design it is a requirement of the 
STC that the pilot flying this aircraft must have completed a type rating course 
that is acceptable to  the NZ Civil Aviation Authority, or the applicable national 
airworthiness authority of the State of Registry.  
3.6.8.  The CAA advised the Commission that it had not been  the intention of the amendment to 
require a full "auditable " conversion course specifically approved by the CAA for the Walter 
Fletcher.  Rather, the flight manual entry was to ensure  that pilots completed conversion 
course s that satisfactorily met the objectives of civil aviation  rules for aircraft type ratings 
(CAA, 2008a).  This included the requiremen t for an applicant to have passed an approved 
basic gas turbine knowledge examination and have a full understanding of the use of reverse 
thrust on approach.   The CAA reported that the accident rate  had subsequently reduce d. 
3.6.9.  On 22 November 2005, a Walter Fletcher FU24 -950, ZK -DZG, suffered an in -flight vertical fin 
failure 5 k ilometres  west of Whangarei.  The aeroplane became uncontrollable and it struck  
the ground , killing the pilot and the loader driver.  Following that accident, concern was raised 
about  the process followed for the certification of the Walter engine into the Fletcher 
aeroplane and whether the modification might  have contributed to the loss of the vertical fin, 
perhaps because of structural fatigue.  The Commission investigation into that  accident found 
"no evidence that the installation  of a more powerful supplemental type certificate -approved 
turbine engine, in place of a piston engine, had initiated the fatigue cracks in the fin leading 
edge " (TAIC, 2009) . 
3.6.10.  In respect of the STC process for the installation  of the Walter engine, the same i nvestigation 
found: "The CAA's supplemental type certificate  approval process for the turbine engine 
installation was generally robust and had followed recognised procedures, but the process 
should have been enhanced by an in -depth evaluation of the fatigue effects on the 
empennage " (TAIC, 2009).  
 
 
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Report 10 -009 3.6.11.  The CAA advised that: "Up to around 2007, the CAA accepted supplemental type certificate 
applications from industry directly and often prepared the s ubstantiation/compliance 
documentation.  In general, supplemental type certificates were not common with industry 
and it was usually a few particular clients who pursued supplemental type certificate 
approvals.  Since the mid 2000's, the CAA has required a ll applicants for approval of a 
significant design change (significant in terms of the amount of engineering required to 
demonstrate compliance) to use the services of a Rule Part 146 Design Organisation.  This 
policy was formalised with the publication of  [advisory circular] AC21 -08". 
Repairs  
3.6.12.  Repairs were normally required to rectify an individual problem and retain  the airworthiness of 
a product.  R ule Part 21, Subpart M prescribed the means for the approval of repair designs.  
Modifications  
3.6.13.  Modifications were probably the most common means of altering the form or function of  an 
aircraft.  Modifications normally involved individual ly approved changes , but under s ome 
conditions, for example  if an operator had a fleet of the same type of  aircraf t, a modification 
could be approved for a whole fleet .  CAA Advisory Circular AC43 -9 Modifications, repairs, and 
the form CAA 337  described acceptable methods of modifying aircraft to ensure compliance 
with the certification of products and parts ( Rule Part 21) and general maintenance rules 
(Rule Part 43).  
3.6.14.  A major modification was described in AC43 -9 as a modification that could potentially affect 
the safety of an aircraft or its occupants if, as a result of its embodiment, one or more of the 
following inci dents could occur:  
a. Structural collapse  
b. Loss of control  
c. Failure of motive power  
d. Unintentional operation of, or inability to operate, any systems or equipment essential 
to the safety or operational function of the aircraft  
e. Incapacitating injury to any occupant  
f. Unacceptable un -serviceability or maintainability.  
3.6.15.  All modifications required sufficient technical data for an engineering analysis of the project to 
ensure that it was appropriate and safe to implement.  The procedure for develop ing and 
implementing a major modification was contained in AC43 -9 and was as follows:   
a. The data was assessed to determine if it was acceptable technical data or if the data 
required approval9 
b. If the data required approval, the descriptive and substan tiating data was submitted to 
the CAA or to a Part 146 aircraft design organisation for approval  
c. The CAA or the design organisation would approve the data  and advise whether the 
modification was a major  modification  or recommend that a n STC  be raised  that was 
considered more appropriate for the purpose  
d. If the modification was determined to be a major  modification , the person inspecting 
and accepting  the modification was required to be the holder of an inspection 
authorisation or an appropriately  authorised  person under CAA Rule Part 145 to certify 
the conformity of the modification with the applicable technical data  
e. The embodiment of the modification was then recorded in the maintenance records. 
The maintenance records included the form CAA 337, w hich was to be completed and a 
copy forwarded to the CAA (see Figure 7). 
                                                        
9 The terms "acceptable", "approved' and "technical" data are described in the Glossary to this report.  
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 13 >>
  
Figure 7 
Modification process (CAA Advisory Circular AC43 -9, Figure 1)  
3.6.16.  Modifications could be approved by a design delegation holder , whereas a n STC could o nly be 
issued by the CAA.  Both processes required the same design and airworthiness standards to 
be met.  However, the STC was considered to be more aligned with international practice and 
allowed the CAA to assess the design changes prior to approval. The CAA could also review any 
proposed flight manual supplements as part of the STC process.  
3.6.17.  The modification process was more common as it was considered administratively easier to 
complete than a n STC.  It was also more appropriate for most minor modifications, especially 
one-off design changes.  However, it had become increasingly common for some modifications 
to be on -sold and therefore bypass the CAA review process.  The CAA had become concerned 
about how these modifications were being applied.   
3.6.18.  On 24 August 2010  (10 days before the accident ) the CAA  amended the conditions of all 
design delegation holders.  Among the changes was the requirement that all major design 
changes were to be processed as  STCs.  The CAA said that there had been  a number of 
reasons for making these changes, which included the need to align to international best 
practice and for the CAA to be engaged at the beginning of the design process.  
3.6.19.  The CAA stated that it was the respo nsibility of an aircraft operator to ensure that an aircraft 
was appropriately equipped for the type of work the operator was undertaking.  It was 
appropriate for a maintenance provider to install approved aircraft modifications at the 
request and directio n of the aircraft operator.  A design delegation holder10 who proposed a 
modification needed to confirm that the modification w as in compliance with design standards 
and fit for purpose.   
Modification of ZK -EUF for parachuting  
 
3.6.20.  The aeroplane owner  had purchased ZK-EUF in early 2010  with the intention of having it 
modified for parachuting operations.  The engineering company  had previously worked on  
another Fletcher aeroplane  in preparation for modif ying it for  parachuting , so it  agreed to 
modify ZK -EUF.  On 8 March 2010 the engineering company told the CAA that ZK -EUF was to 
be modified for parachuting and asked the CAA to have ZK -EUF changed from the "restricted " 
category (used for agricultural operations ) to the "standard " category (used for parachuting ).   
3.6.21.  The change of ZK -EUF from an agricultural topdressing aeroplane in the restricted category to 
a standard category aeroplane to be used for parachuting operations required the 
embodiment of a number of STCs and major modifications.  The Supplemental Typ e Certificate 
Data Sheet for the installation of the Walter engine (STC 98/21E/15) stated that: "For 
operation in the Normal Category11 the aircraft must be equipped with an alternate air intake 
door in accordance with Drawing TCL -07-027 and a fuel drain co llector system in accordance 
with Drawing TCL -07-028".The technical data for these 2 modifications was owned and 
                                                        
10 If a Part 146 design organisation wishes to approve a design change without prior reference to the CAA,  it must employ, as a "senior 
person" [see 4. 5.2], the holder of a CAA design delegation, called a design delegation holder.  
11"Normal Category" was a United States term used in Federal Aviation Rule Part 23 Airworthiness Design Standard, and was 
understood in New Zealand to have the same meaning as standard category.   


<< Page 14 >>
 Report 10 -009 controlled by the engineering company and had been approved by the CAA as part of the STC 
process for the installation of the Walter engine.  
3.6.22.  On 13 April the CAA replied by email that for an aircraft to be eligible for the standard category 
the engineering company  needed to complete the modifications and supply the CAA with the 
following documentation:  
1. A copy of the worksheets covering the conv ersion to standard category 
configuration, including a logbook summary.  
  2. A copy of the last annual review of airworthiness.  
  3. A copy of the modifications page from the aircraft logbook.  
3.6.23.  The engineering company modified ZK -EUF for parachuting operations by firstly removing all 
the equipment associated with topdressing, such as  the hopper and spray equipment .  Then, 
installing  a range of major modifications that had been used on other aerop lanes, including 
some Walter Fletchers, the engineering company  configured ZK -EUF for parachuting.  These 
modifications included  the installation of a strengthened floor and a parachutist access door 
in the rear of the a eroplane , internal and external grab  rails, and a step (see Figure 8).  Two 
STCs for the fitment of 2 oxygen systems to permit flights up to 16 000 feet were also 
embodied at this time.   
 
Figure 8 
ZK-EUF modifications  
3.6.24.  The engineering company had previously contracted a Rule Part 146 aircraft design 
organisation to design a number of aircraft modifications for the engineering company's use in 
undertaking parachuting convers ions on the Walter Fletcher.  The contracted organisation 
included a design delegation holder who designed the modifications.  
3.6.25.  In addition to the parachuting conversion work, the vertical fin was replaced as part of a 
continuing airworthiness requirement fo r the FU24 -950 and -954 series of Fletcher aircraft.  
Also al l the flight control cables were replaced and the flight control rigging checked.

 3.6.26.  On completion of the parachuting conversion , a weight and balance check of the aeroplane 
was performed .  On 25 M ay 2010 a  weight and balance data sheet was filled in and inserted 
into the flight manual  for the aeroplane .  The weight and balance data sheet recorded an 
empty weight of 3103 pounds (1407k ilograms  [kg]) and a centre of gravity position of 17.57 
inches (0 .446m) aft of datum.  An annual review of airworthiness was also completed.   An 
engineer , who held an inspection authorisation , then signed the relevant CAA 337 fo rms 
certif ying that the modifications conform ed with the technical data as required under Rule 
Part 43 Subpart E . Records showed  that the aeroplane had accrued 17 626 hours at this 
time.  
3.6.27.  A copy of the required documentation was forwarded to  the CAA, wh ich on 3 June 2010 issued 
a replacement airworthiness certification for ZK -EUF in the st andard category.  After a test 
flight on 1 July, the operator took possession of the aeroplane and flew it to Fox Glacier.  
Parachuting operations with the aeroplane commenced on 4 July.  
3.6.28.  An examination of the maintenance logbooks for ZK -EUF found  that the following 
modifications had been carried out to prepare the aeroplane for parachuting operations:

The first 2 changes were STC changes required for the change in category ; the rest were 
classified as modifications.  
3.6.29.  No reco rd could be found in the logbooks for the fitting of the strengthened floor in the rear of 
the aeroplane.  The engineering company  later advised that th e floor modification  would have 
been completed using a modification designed specifically for the engine ering company  and 
approved by the design delegation holder .  The engineering company  agreed that there should 
have been a logbook entry for the floor and this had been  an oversight on its part.  
3.6.30.  An examination of relevant CAA records regarding the parachuting conversion, in particular the 
technical data for the various modifications embodied on ZK -EUF, showed that most were 
major modifications that had been developed by the engineering company.  The CAA records 
did not include a copy of the CAA 337 form for the modification of the aeroplane floor, 
although some information was provided in the attached worksheets submitted.  
3.6.31.  The engineering company had also made  several major modifications developed by other 
companies that held Rule Part 146 certificat es for aircraft design organisations.  The 
modifications for the top grab rail and lower fuselage steps, MB25 -00-60 drawing s 3 and 5, 
were originally designed and approved for fitment to a Cresco model of aeroplane.  The 
modification for the fitment of the  air deflector door, SL/M 123 , was also held by another 
design organisation.  The engineering company later advised that modification AAE.MOD.157 
had been purchased from an aviation company that believed it was  the rightful owner.  It had 
agreed to sell th e engineering company a full set of drawings, stamped with certified stamps 
and signatures.  
3.6.32.  The engineering company, in order to use a modification designed by another certified design 
organisation, was required by civil aviation  rules to obtain the approv al of that organisation to 
ensure the modification was able to be embodied on ZK -EUF.  This had not been done for 
some of the modifications and the design organisations concerned were not aware that their 
modifications had been used on ZK -EUF, for example modification MB25 -00-60.  

<< Page 16 >>
 Report 10 -009 3.6.33.  The flight manual for ZK -EUF was also examined.  Rule Part 91.111 listed the aircraft flight 
manual as one of the documents to be carried in the aircraft.  However, the aeroplane 
operator advised that as the aeroplane had been  flown by either of the 2 pilots from the same 
location , it had been  decided to keep the flight manual in the operator's office.  
3.6.34.  The flight manual for ZK -EUF held the aeroplane's current airworthiness certificate, a technical 
log for recording daily flight hou rs and the current weight and balance data sheet, as well as 
the normal operating information for the Walter Fletcher.  The flight manual also held 2 STCs 
containing information on the oxygen systems fitted to the aeroplane, one for the pilot and one 
for the rear compartment occupants.  The flight manual contained no other supplements or 
material to show  that the aeroplane had been converted for parachuting operations.   
3.6.35.  For the aeroplane to be used for parachuting operations, Rule Part 91.705 (b ) (6) requi red the 
flight manual to authorise the removal or opening of the rear door in flight  (CAA, 2010a ).  
Modification SL/M 123 included such a flight manual supplement but this had not been 
inserted into the flight manual by the engineering company.  
3.6.36.  The weight and balance reference and planning information contained in section 6 of the flight 
manual  had remained unaltered since  the parachuting conversion and still referred to the 
hopper and the rear cargo compartment.  In the restricted agricultural a irworthiness category, 
the Walter Fletcher had a maximum certificated take -off weight of 2463kg , with a forward 
centre of gravity limit of 0.513m aft of datum and a rear limit of 0.645m aft of datum.  In the 
modified standard  airworthiness category for par achuting operations the maximum allowable 
take-off weight was reduced to 2204kg.  The forward centre of gravity  limit was amended to 
0.428m aft of datum, but the aft limit remained the same at 0.645m aft of datum.  
3.6.37.  Civil Aviation Rules stated that during da ylight hours aeroplanes operating under visual flight 
rules were required to land with a minimum fuel load that would permit a further 30 minutes 
of flight (CAA, 2010c).  
3.6.38.  The flight manual limitations section for the Walter Fletcher gave  an unusable fuel qu antity of 
70 litres.  However, the current weight and balance data sheet inserted into the flight manual 
for ZK -EUF recorded an unusable fuel quantity of 50.5 litres.  The CAA considered  that the 
flight manual limitation of 70 litres, having been determine d as part of the STC process, was 
the correct quantity and this figure should have been used in all Walter Fletcher basic weight 
calculations.  The additional 20 litres usable for ZK -EUF was a safety bonus that should not  
have  been relied  on.  The aeroplan e owner  said that ZK -EUF had used about 60 litres of fuel 
for an average parachuting flight, and the consumption rate was about 160 litres per hour of 
flying  
3.6.39.  The CAA advised that it was "satisfied in principle with the process that ZK -EUF went through 
when  converting from the Restricted Category for agricultural operations to the Standard 
Category for parachuting operations ".  The CAA was only concerned with determining that the 
aircraft was eligible for the  Standard  Category by having the mandatory modific ations required 
under Note 3 of the Supplemental Type Ce rtificate  Data Sheet installed (the Walter 
conversion ) − and that the aeroplane was airworthy and in an approved configuration.  The 
chief engineer of the engineering company  assessed the airworthines s.  The CAA reviewed the 
337 forms that had been signed by the engineer , but  did not check  all the individual 
modifications.  The  CAA did not think there  was anything in the list to indicate that any of the 
modifications would conflict with each other, or not be compatible.  
3.6.40.  The CAA  had relied on the modifications being correctly designed by a design delegation 
holder, correctly carried out by aircraft maintenance engineers and correctly checked for 
compliance by an engineer with an inspection authori sation .  When  reviewing the 
airworthiness of ZK -EUF after the accident, the CAA agreed that some of the modifications had 
been  approved for use on a limited number of aircraft  only, and should not have been made to 
ZK-EUF without approval .  As a result the CAA would not allow another aircraft to undergo a 
similar conversion unless all modifications were applicable to the aircraft and any deficiencies 
to the flight manual supplements were addressed.  
 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 17 >>
 3.6.41.  The CAA agreed that the flight manual supplement issued when  the modification for the 
aeroplane floor was approved did not provide sufficient guidance for a pilot to calculate the 
weight and balance of the aircraft.   The CAA also thought  that if some of the modifications  that 
had been  made to ZK -EUF were proposed no w, they possibly  would have to be progressed as  
STCs based on the changes it had made to the design delegations 10 days before the 
accident .  The floor modification was given as a likely example of a major design change 
requiring a n STC and, therefore, CAA approval.  
3.6.42.  At the time of the accident ZK -EUF had accrued a total of 17 707 hours since manufacture 
and had 18 hours to run until the next planned maintenance, a 100 -hour check.  Records and 
interviews indicated there were no known aeroplane defects or unse rviceable equipment that 
might have contributed to the accident.   
Parachuting in New Zealand  
3.6.43.  Parachuting in New Zealand, and in particular commercial parachuting operations, had grown 
significantly in the 10 years  leading up to the accident involving ZK -EUF.  The NZPIA, which  
represent ed the largest number of parachuting operators in New Zealand, estimated that its 
members completed 140 000 parachute descents annually, dropping an estimated 225 000 
people. This equ ated to 85 000 tandem jumps (NZPIA, 2010).  In 2010 t he total number of 
tandem jumps by all parachuting operators , including non -NZPIA organisations, was estimated 
to be 100 000.  
3.6.44.  At the time of the accident commercial parachuting,  hot-air ballooning, glid ing, hang gliding 
and paragliding  were all operations that were exempt from  the rules that governed air 
operations for the carriage of passengers or goods by air for hire or reward (CAA, 2008 b).  
Parachuting operations were governed by R ule Part 105 (CAA, 2010 b), but t his rule only 
covered the actual parachut e jumping  and the parachuting equipment and the  maintenance 
of it.  Rule Part 91 contained  general operating and flight rules that were applicable to all 
aircraft , but nothing specific to parachute -drop  aircraft . 
3.6.45.  Civil aviation  rules required the pilots of parachute drop aeroplanes  (Rule Part 61 Subpart N) 
and tandem masters ( Rule Part 105 Subpart A) to hold ratings applicable for their duties.  The 
ratings could be issued and subsequently administered by  approved aviation recreation 
organisation s certified by the CAA under R ule Part 149  (CAA, 2007) .  There was no 
requirement for regular auditing or inspection s of parachuting operators or operatio ns, as 
would occur for certificated air transport operators  such as  the many helicopter tourist 
operators located  around Fox Glacier.  
Oversight of parachuting  
3.6.46.  The CAA reported that as parachuting operations were not required to be certified at the time 
of the accident, there had been  no auditing undertaken of the p arachuting operators.  Further, 
the CAA stated that it was  "not currently resourced to undertake such activity ".  Pilot currency 
requirements were the responsibility of the operator, while tandem master qualifications were 
administered by the Rule Part 149  parachuting organisation  to which  the operator was 
affiliated.    
3.6.47.  The CAA aviation safety adviser responsible for the South Island confirmed that he had visited 
the operator about twice annually in the 5 years leading up to the accident.  These visits wer e 
reported to have been of an informal nature.  The adviser stated that there had been concern 
expressed by some local residents and operators about noise levels and the routes being 
flown by the operator, and suggestions that parachutists were descending through cloud.  
These concerns related to the piston -powered aeroplane the operator was flying at the time.  
The adviser has found no evidence to support the concerns and no findings or file notes had 
been  made as a result of these visits.  The aviation safety adviser had last called on the 
operator on 1 July 2010, while the 2 pilots were away taking delivery of ZK -EUF.

 Report 10 -009 Safety restraints  
3.6.48.  With the exception of the pilot, none of the occupants of ZK -EUF was wearing a safety restraint 
or belt.  R ule Part  91.207 (e) exempt ed passengers engaged in parachuting operations from 
the general requirement to occupy berth s or seat s and wear safety restraint s for take -off and 
landing.  
3.6.49.  On 29 November 2001, a Cessna A185E Skywagon ZK -JGI took off from Motueka aerodrome 
on a local parachuting flight.  Shortly after take -off, at about 100 feet  (about 30 m) , ZK-JGI had 
a sudden and total power loss.  Unable to re -establish power, the pilot guided the aeroplane to 
a nearby kiwi fruit orchard.  After clipping trees the aeroplane struck the ground heavily, 
resulting in the pilot and 4 parachutists receiving serious injuries and one parachutist 
sustaining minor injuries (TAIC, 2001).  
3.6.50.  The Commission 's investigation of that accident d etermined that "the seriousness of the 
injuries sustained by the occupants may have been reduced had they been wearing some 
form of safety restraint ".  The Commission therefore recommended to the Director of Civil 
Aviation that  he, in conjunction with the New Zealand Parachuting Federation, "complete a 
study into the utility of parachutists wearing safety restraints for take -off and landing, and 
include any resulting recommendations in the rule making process as a petition by March 
2003.  (018/02) ".  The re commendation was accepted by the Director.  
3.6.51.  Following the accident involving ZK -EUF, the CAA advised that a study of passenger restraints 
had recently been completed in conjunction with industry representatives.  As a result t he CAA 
had decided not to mandate the fitment of restraints to "smaller aircraft ", typically those 
carrying 10 or few er parachutists.  There was a continued concern that , for small aircraft in 
particular , parachutists could become tangled with the restraints, causing the premature 
release of a parachute or a hang -up on exiting  the aeroplane .  Both scenarios were reported to 
have occurred both  in New Zealand and overseas.   
3.6.52.  The wearing of safety restraints during parachuting operations was not compulsory in either 
the United Kingdom or the Unite d States, but was required in Australia.  Anecdotal evidence 
provided by parachuti sts and  aviation safety personnel  in Australia and New Zealand  was that 
the requirement to wear a safety restraint in Australia was commonly ignored  and the belts  
were either removed or folded away . 
3.6.53.  On 29 July 2006 a de Havilland DHC -6-100 Twin Otter engaged in parachuting operations 
crashed on take -off in Sullivan, Missouri, United States.  The pilot and 5 of the parachutists 
received fatal injuries and the remain ing 2 parachutists were seriously injured.  The 
investigation report by the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB ) found 
that 5 of the 7 parachutists had been  likely restrained by a single -point harness system and 
only one of these survi ved (NTSB, 2006) .  The other 2 parachutists had been  unrestrained and 
one survived .  Following testing the report concluded "that a single -point restraint system is 
not sufficient to provide adequate restraint for parachutists ". 
3.6.54.  The NTSB report recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United 
States Parachute Association jointly "determine the most effective dual -point restraint 
systems for parachutists that reflect the various aircraft and seating configu rations used in 
parachuting operations ".  Once the most effective dual -point restraint systems had been  
identified , the United States Parachuting Association  was recommended to educate and 
encourage its members to use  them.  No update was available a t the t ime of writing this 
report .

 Health and safety  
3.6.55.  On 5 May 2003 the CAA was designated by "Prime Ministerial designation "12 to administer the 
provisions of the HSE Act in respect of the aviation sector, specifically for aircraft while in 
operation.  The CAA's HSE Unit was set up in 2003 and 2 staff members from the Department 
of Labour were seconded to run the Unit.  A memorandum of understanding between the 
Department of Labour and the CAA was agreed and identified the CAA's task s as "establishing 
and monitori ng civil aviation and security standards, investigation of incidents and the 
promotion of aviation safety and s ecurity ".  The memorandum also stated  that:  
The CAA's administration of the HSE Act involves providing to employers,  employees,  
self-employed -people and others, who have responsibilities  and duties to maintain 
effective safety mechanisms, applicable to the CAA  HSE designation, information, 
education and advice on occupational safety  and health issues, undertaking 
compliance audits,  inspections, and  investigations, and may involve issuing notices 
and taking enforcement actions.  
3.6.56.  The manager of the HSE Unit confirmed that in meeting its requirements under the HSE Act, 
the Unit had adopted a flexible approach to investigat ing incidents and had commenced an 
audit programme of operators.  S ince 2003 the Unit had completed about 30 audits of 
operators each year and participated in regular educational and safety seminars and meetings 
with various sectors of the aviation industry.  The Unit h ad produced and distributed a variety 
of educational material, for example a safety booklet for agricultural operators and farmers, 
jointly produced with the Department of Labour.   
3.6.57.  The manager stated that the initial focus of the Unit had been  on Rule Part 119 air operators  
and Rule Part 137 agricultural operators, as th ey were  identified as offering the  most safety 
benefit s.  Rule Part 119 air  operators ranged from large airline s to operators of tourist 
helicopter flights.  According to the CAA database, there were 184 Rule Part 119 operators 
and 104 Rule Part 137 agricultural operators.  There w ere also 115 training and maintenance 
certificated organisations that were audited when concerns arose.    
3.6.58.  The manager advised that the audit programme was run in conjunction with the CAA's 
surveillance policy. Certificated organisations were given "risk rating s" that initiated CAA audit 
inspections and follow -up audits as required.  The manager advised that  HSE audits were 
focused on personal safety and not operational safety.  He described operational safety as 
actions or inactions covered by C ivil Aviation Rules.  For example , low flying and operating an 
aircraft outside  its flight manual limitations were operation al safety issue s.  Conditions outside 
Civil Aviation Rules, for example adequate hearing protection and the control of hot drink  
service s by cabin crew members w ere personal safety issue s and therefore came under the 
HSE Unit's responsibility.  
3.6.59.  Between 11 and 18 August 2010, in anticipation of the introduction of R ule Part 115 
Adventure Aviation  and to get an indication of the level of safety of parachute operations , the 
HSE Unit completed audit inspections o f4 of the larger parachuting operators  located in the 
central North Island.  Rule Part 115  was intended to cover commercial activities previously 
exempted, including parachute -drop and tandem -parachute operations.  The manager  
commented that he thought the standard of personal safety was good at the 4 operators they 
had inspected .  The manager had no piloting or engineering experience and was not able to 
comment on operational safety and compliance matters regarding the 4 operators.  Follow -up 
educational material was later passed to the NZPIA f or distribution to member organisations.

 Report 10 -009 3.7. Additional  informat ion 
Weight and balance  
3.7.1.  Rule Part 91.109 stated that no person shall operate an aircraft unless it was operated in 
compliance with the operating limitations specified in the aircraft flight manual.  Included 
within the operating limitations of a flight manual were the weight and balance li mitations 
applicable for that aircraft.  To help achieve this requirement an accurate record was required 
of the aircraft's empty weight and empty weight centre of gravity.  
3.7.2.  CAA Advisory Circular AC43 -2 detailed acceptable practices for the control of airc raft empty 
weight and balance (CAA, 1997).  An aircraft was to be reweighed whenever it was believed 
that the latest data was inaccurate , or requested in the interests of safety.  Typical reasons for 
reweighing included modification s and repair s, equipment  changes, maintenance such as 
painting, and when records were incomplete or missing.  
3.7.3.  The weight and balance data sheet current for the aeroplane at the time of the accident gave 
the empty weight as 3103 pounds (1407kg), the datum reference as the leading edge of the 
centre wing, and the longitudinal centre of gravity position as 17.57 inch es (0.446m) aft of the 
datum.  
3.7.4.  A review of the history of ZK -EUF identified that at manufacture the aeroplane had had a basic 
weight of 1208.3kg and a centre of gravity  position of 0.359m aft of datum.  Following the 
installation of the Walter engine in Oc tober 1998, ZK -EUF was reweighed and the basic weight 
was determined to have increased to 1318.6kg and the centre of gravity  position moved 
forward to 0.3576m  aft of datum . 
3.7.5.  In February 2004 ZK -EUF was repainted.  The aeroplane was reweighed and the weight was 
determined to have increased to 1389.8kg and the centre of gravity  moved aft to 0.3724m  aft 
of datum .  The next reweigh, the last before the modification for parachuting, was in 
September 2006 following modifications to the instrument panel.  The aerop lane weight was 
determined to be 1421.6kg, and the centre of gravity  was at 0.3954m  aft of datum . 
3.7.6.  An e xamination of the documentation for ZK -EUF, including all the modification data,  
determined that the change in basic weight after the parachuting modifica tion, from 1421.6kg 
to 1407kg , was correct  as recorded .  The change in centre of gravity  position from 0.3954m to 
0.446m was also correct as recorded when considering the equipment removed was located 
near the centre of gravity , and the newly installed flo or, grab rails and steps were all aft of the 
centre of gravity . The equipment used to weigh ZK -EUF was also confirmed to be suitable and 
its calibration was current  at the time of the reweigh in June 2010.  
3.7.7.  The weight and balance section of the flight manu al described "the procedure for establishing 
weight and balance (relative to a reference datum) of the empty aeroplane ".  The section 
recorded the centre of gravity  limitations, standard moment arms and load envelope.  Two 
generic sample forms, one using metric units and one using imperial  units , were available for 
calculating the weight and moment arm for agricultural  operations (see Figure 9). 
3.7.8.  An e xamination of the operator's booking  diary and loading receipts showed that since the 
introduction into serv ice of ZK -EUF the aeroplane operator had flown about 193 revenue 
flights or loads.  Of these about 74 loads had had 8 parachutists, 16 loads had had 7 
parachutists, 86 loads had had 6 parachutists and 17 loads had had 4 parachutists.  
3.7.9.  The aeroplane owner  commented that it was standard practice not to complete a weight and 
balance sheet for each flight and none had been done since the commencement of 
parachuting operations using ZK -EUF.  The 2 pilots had completed several weight and balance 
calculations as pa rt of their conversion training and type rating.  The calculations had been  
done using the loading chart in the flight manual and the weight and balance data for the 
Walter Fletcher used for their conversion training, not for ZK -EUF.  The calculations repo rtedly 
used a range of loads, including 8 parachutists.  For their calculations the pilots had used an 
average weight of 70kg per person, plus the weight of the parachuting rigs.   
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 21 >>
 3.7.10.  The aeroplane owner  commented that as part of the induction into service of  ZK-EUF, there 
had been discussions with another Walter Fletcher parachuting operator about their loading 
practices.  The other operator had previously been in communication with the CAA regarding 
the use of a standard passenger weight as described in CAA Advisory Circular AC119 -4 for air 
transport operations (CAA, 2005).  The other operator had completed a 3 -month survey in 
early 2010, weighing every passenger to determine an average passenger weight.  The other 
operator had determined that the average wei ght of  the passengers was less than 70kg, but 
elected to use 70kg as the mean for calculations.  That information was passed to the CAA 
which, at the time of the accident , had not responded .   
3.7.11.  The other  operator was confident that the 70kg figure was accurate to use as a standard 
weight unless a passenger appeared to be heavier than normal, in which case they would be 
weighed.  Weighing would also be necessary in such a case to ensure that the weight lim its of 
the parachuting rigs were not exceeded.  
3.7.12.  The other operator had then completed a series of weight and balance calculations for a range 
of fuel loads and parachutists.  It was assumed for each calculation that the passengers were 
positioned as far for ward as possible , and with the heaviest tandem pairs  most  forward.  The 
weight and balance was determined to be within limitations for all loading conditions , although 
with 8 passengers the centre of gravity  would be  close to the aft limit. The other opera tor's 
aeroplane , although similarly equipped to ZK -EUF with a sliding door, internal and external 
grab rails, oxygen system and external steps, weighed 74kg less.  The centre of gravity  was 
0.3429m aft of datum , 0.1031m  further forward than the centre of g ravity  for ZK -EUF.  
3.7.13.  The aeroplane owner , aware of the results of the 3 -month trial, considered that as the 
demographic of the passengers for both operators was the same, the same standard 
passenger weights could be used for their operation.  Further, becaus e the 2 aeroplanes were 
so similar in configuration, provided a similar loading policy of having the heaviest passengers 
as far forward as possible was followed, ZK -EUF would also be within its weight and balance 
limitations.  For these reasons t he aeropla ne owner  did not conduct any load calculations 
before utili sing ZK -EUF in the parachuting role.

Figure 9 
ZK-EUF weight and balance loading form (metric)  
3.7.14.  The basic weights and centre of gravity  positions for the other  2 Walter Fletcher aeroplanes 
used for parachuting also varied from those of ZK -EUF.  A summary of the basic weights and 
centre of gravity  positions for all 4 modified aeroplanes follows:  
Aeroplane  Basic weight  Centre of gravity position  
ZK-NZS 1306kg  0.314m  
ZK-DJE 1333kg  0.343m  
ZK-EUD 1343 kg 0.380m  
ZK-EUF 1407 kg 0.446m  
Weight and balance  calculations  
3.7.15.  As part of this investigation, more than  50 weight an d balance calculations for ZK -EUF were 
completed using a range of conservative passenger weights and loading combinations.  The 
weights used included the standard weight of 70 kg and a range of assumed actual weights 
based on recent medical information and autopsy reports.  For each of the calculations  with 8 
parachutists on  board , the aeroplane was determined to be over its maximum weight limit and 
the centre of gravity outside the rear limit.  See Appendix 1 for a summary of the calculations.  
Special parachuting investigation report  
3.7.16.  On 16 September 2008 the NTSB  adopted a  "Special In vestigation Report on the Safety of 
Parachute Jump Operations "(NTSB, 2008) . As part of th at investigation the NTSB had 

 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 23 >>
 reviewed some 32 fatal accidents involving parachuting aircraft since 1980 , involving the loss 
of 172  parachutists and pilots .  The repor t referenced United States Parachuting Association 
safety records from 1992 to 2007, showing that "about 30 parachutists per year were killed in 
jumping mishaps ".  In the same timeframe, NTSB accident data showed "about 5 parachutist 
fatalities per year resulted from accidents involving parachute operations aircraft ".   
3.7.17.  The Special Investigation R eport identified the following 3 recurring safety issues:  
• inadequate aircraft inspection and maintenance  
• pilot performance deficiencies in basic airmanship tasks, such as pre -flight  inspections,  
weight and balance calculations, and emergency and recovery procedures  
• inadequate FAA oversight and direct surveillance of parachuting operations.  
3.7.18.  Eight of the aircraft involved in the 32 accidents were determined not  to be airworthy at the 
time of the accident s.  While some of these were for minor maintenance discrepancies, the 
scale of the non -compliance raised concerns about poor maintenance and quality assurance 
practices.  Parachuting, like some other short , repet itive operations, was conducive to greater 
aircraft and engine wear.  Operators, therefore, needed to comply strictly with manufacturers ' 
requirements and recommendations.  
3.7.19.  The report found that "a disturbing common denominator in nearly all of the accident s 
reviewed is that the pilots, most of whom were commercial or airline transport pilots, were 
deficient in basic airmanship tasks ", including "complying with aircraft weight and balance 
limitations ".  The report determined that "in 9 of the 12 accidents in volving airplanes that 
were loaded beyond their maximum allowable gross weights or outside the cg  [centre of 
gravity]  limits, the weight and balance issue was found to be a cause or factor ". 
3.7.20.  The FAA's oversight and surveillance of parachute -jump operators was found by the NTSB to 
"have been inadequate to ensure operators are properly maintaining their aircraft and safely 
conducting operations ".  Many of the parachuting operators had displayed unacceptable 
deficiencies that would or should hav e been detected during FAA inspections.  
Cannabis in aviation  
3.7.21.  Civil aviation rules stated that:  
No crew member while acting in his or her official capacity shall be in a state of 
intoxication or in a state of health in which his or her capacity  so to act w ould be 
impaired by reason of his or her having consumed or  used any intoxicant, 
sedative, narcotic, or stimulant or preparation  (CAA, 2010d).  
3.7.22.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB)  published a report into an accident on 26 
September 2002, where an aircraft crashed shortly after take -off, killing all 6 occupants 
(ATSB, 2002). The ATSB investigation found that the pilot had cannabis metabolites, opiates 
and paracetamol  in his blood.  As part of the investigation the A TSB commissioned a resear ch 
report on cannabis and its effects (ATSB, 2004).  
3.7.23.  The research report summary stated  the following:  
Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug, which has widespread effects 
within the body.  Smoking is the most common form of administration.  The 
adverse effects of cannabis on behaviour, cognitive function and psychomotor 
performance are dose -depend ent and related to task difficulty.  Complex tasks 
such as driving or flying are particularly sensitive to the performance impairing 
effects of cannabis . 
Chronic cannabis use is associated with a number of adverse health effects and 
there is evidence suggesting the development of tolerance to chronic use as well 
as a well -defined withdrawal syndrome.  There is also evidence that the residual 
effects of ca nnabis can last up to 24 hours.  Significantly, the modern dose of 
cannabis is much more potent than in the past, when the majority of the 
research was conducted.  As such, the reported adverse health effects may well 
be conservative . 

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 10 -009 Although only a limit ed number of studies have examined the effects of cannabis 
on pilot performance, the results overall have been consistent.  Flying skills 
deteriorate, and the number of minor and major errors committed by the pilot 
increase, while at the same time the pilo t is often unaware of any performance 
problems.  Cannabis use in a pilot is therefore a significant flight safety hazard.  
3.7.24.  The research report stated that "after alcohol and tobacco, and excluding caffeine, cannabis is 
the third most popular recreational dr ug". The level of THC found in the blood of cannabis 
users var ies widely between individuals and can be influenced by factors like frequency of use 
and experience, and when smoked the size and potency of the cannabis cigarette and 
smoking technique.  Accor ding to the pathologist, the subjective symptoms of cannabis 
intoxication usually peaked 10 to 15 minutes after smoking cannabis, but the effects could 
last about 1.5 to 4 hours.  
3.7.25.  The Commission has recently made a recommendation to the New Zealand Ministry  of 
Transport regarding the use of performance -impairing substances in the transport industries 
(marine report 09 -201) .  In late 2005 t he Ministry of Transport establish ed the Su bstance 
Impairment  Group  to look at the issue in respect of all transport mode s.  The Group, made up 
of representatives from the air, sea, road and rail transport sectors , was "charged with scoping 
the problem and making recommendations to the Minister of Transport to initiate any required 
changes in legislation ". 
3.7.26.  The Substance Impairment Group was last convened in 2009.  In 2010, the Ministry of 
Transport advised the Minister of Transport that it would investigate the feasibility of 
implementing a compulsory post -accident and -incident alcohol and drug testing regi me in the 
aviation, maritime and rail transport sectors.  The Ministry advised the Commission  that it 
intended to commence this work during the 2011/12 fiscal year.  This work would involve 
further liaison with the Substance Impairment Group.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  The accident flight started as a routine parachute drop.  The circumstances were similar in 
many ways to other routine flights conducted using the same aircraft.  The weather conditions 
were suitable for the flight , and the weight and distribution of the tandem masters  and 
passengers would not have been significantly different from those of  previous flights.  
4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses what might have happened to cause the crash and also looks 
at several other contributing safety issues.  These safety issues include:  
 aspects of the way the operator and aeroplane owner  operated the aircraft  
 the management of the weight and balance of the aircraft  
 problems with th e process for converting the aircraft for parachuting  
 the CAA 's oversight of the conversion to parachuting  
 the CAA 's oversight of the parachuting industry  
 the w earing of restraints in parachute -drop aircraft . 
4.1.3.  Although not contributing to this accident , the issue of performance -impairing substances 
being detected in 2 of the tandem masters is discussed along with the wider ramifications for 
the industry.  
4.2. The flight  
4.2.1.  The circumstances of the accident flight were consistent with a loss of control of the 
aeroplane during the  take-off sequence .  There was no evidence of any technical  failure , and 
the engine was capable of  provid ing full power throughout the short flight.  The possibility of 
the pilot having becom e incapacitated was considered to be unlikely  because he was fit and in 
good health, and the flight path  of the aeroplane indicated that he was attempting to 
manoeuvre it out of the dive.  
4.2.2.  The pilot had refuelled the aeroplane during the lunch break and the weather was still f ine and 
calm .  The passengers were brief ed in preparation for their drop and boarded after the 
aeroplane engine had been started.  While the exact seating positions could not be confirmed, 
there was nothing to suggest that the seating arrangement was any different from  that 
adopted on  previous occasions.  The short taxi from the refuel position to the runway  and the 
initial part of the take -off roll were  normal.  
4.2.3.  What was different was that the aeroplane may have become airborne early , and that as the 
aeroplane bec ame air borne it continued to pitch up.  The pitch  up was not stopped  and 
continued until the aeroplane became nearly vertical .  To stop the initial pitch -up the pilot 
would have needed to apply sufficient forward elevator to counter the change in pitch attitude .  
The amount of elevator control required would have depended on the longitudinal stability of 
the aircraft  and elevator effectiveness , the latter being a function of how much forward 
elevator the pilot managed to put in  and the airspeed.  The slower the airspeed, the less air 
flow over the elevator and the less effective it would be.  
4.2.4.  The following  possib ilities for the pitch up were considered : 
 the pilot deliberate ly getting airborne early  and pulling up steeply  
 the flight controls being jammed or locked, preventing  the pilot moving the  elevator  
control  
 the trim not being correctly set , thus catching the pilot unawares  
 the centre of gravity  being excessively rearwards and beyond the controllability limits of 
the aeroplane  
 the parachutists  moving rearwards during the acceleration to take-off or during the  
initial pitch -up, which would have shifted the centre of gravity  further aft  and further 
outside  the control  limits of the aeroplane  

<< Page 26 >>
 Report 10 -009  a combination of any of these  factors . 
4.2.5.  The pilot was an experienced parachut e-drop pilot and was thought by his peers to be 
competent and responsible.  He was reported as fit and healthy, and in preparation for a full 
day's flying had retired early the previous night.  With a short break before the accident flight 
he should not have been fatigued .  No reason was offered that might have suggested  his 
decision -making ability was impaired.  
4.2.6.  Considering his experience, the pilot should have been aware that the centre of gravity  was 
well aft and therefore he needed to avoid any abrupt  manoeuvres, especially at low speed.  
Further, he would probably have incurred the wrath of the t andem masters had he deliberately 
undertaken a steep departure from take -off.  The pilot was , therefore,  unlikely to have 
deliberately g ot airborne early and immediately pitch ed the nose of the aeroplane upwards.  
4.2.7.  The aeroplane owner noted that during the t ake-off roll, forward elevator input was used to 
stop nose -wheel shimmy and counter the effects of the aft centre of gravity.  Therefore, while 
the pilot may not have intended to pitch the nose of the aeroplane up high, the possibility that 
he relaxed the forward pressure on the control column late in the take -off roll to  allow it to lift 
off gently  earlier cannot be discounted.  
4.2.8.  The replacement of the control cables as part of the engineering work converting the 
aeroplane for parachuting was routine work and not an indication of any previous control 
problem.  There was no evidence of any binding or fraying of the control  cables  that could 
have restrict ed their movement , but the impact damage and fire prevented this possibility 
being ruled out.  
4.2.9.  The control lock was not located during the site examination and so the possibility of the pilot 
becoming airborne or attempting to become airborne with the controls locked cannot be fully 
excluded.  The engineering company and aeroplane owner submitted that this may have been 
the cause of the accident.  However, this was considered unlikely for the following reasons:  
 The weather conditions were calm and there was no obvious requirement for the pilot to 
lock the controls during the lunch break  
 It was not normal practise to use the control lock.  
 The pilot typically used a bungee cord if required to hold the control column forward for 
easier ingress and egress.  
 If the control column was locked, the pilot should have noticed this when he:  
a. re-entered the cockpit and prepared to start the engine,  
b. moved the aeroplane forward onto the runway,  
c. pressed the transmit button on top of th e control column to radio other aircraft in the 
area that ZK -EUF was about to take -off, and  
d. when he began to feel the forces on the controls as airspeed increased in the early 
stages of the take off roll.  
4.2.10.  If the pilot had locked the controls and forgotten to unlock them before  commenc ing the take -
off roll , their locked position would have helped to hold the aeroplane nose down on take -off 
and the aeroplane would not have become airborne early . Also, if the lock  or bracket had given 
way or suddenly released  while the pilot was pulling hard back on a locked control column, the 
flight  path  would have been different from  the witness accounts t hat the aeroplane bec ame 
airborne then steadily  pitched up .  Finally, the direction of the tear in the 2 holes of the 
supporting bracket  was down and forward , which  was not consistent with the pilot pulling 
rearwards on a locked control column . For this re ason the damage to the control lock bracket 
most likely occurred during the impact.  
4.2.11.  A post-accident  examination of the wreckage confirmed that the elevator trim was set to 
nearly fully forward - the normal take -off position.  The setting of the trim was a pre-take-off 
checklist item .  As with most small aircraft , the pilot would have memorised the checklist .  
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 27 >>
 With training and experience these checklists can become semi -automated  and pilots  can 
forget items, especially when distracted . 
4.2.12.  The possibility of th e pilot taking -off with the trim incorrectly set cannot be totally excluded.  
The aeroplane owner submitted that he had forgotten to reset the trim on other aircraft 
several times and the pilot may have done likewise.  However, this was considered unlikely  for 
the following reasons : 
 The pilot had erred once , two weeks before the accident, and should have been alert to 
setting the trim correctly before take -off. 
 The operator had added a prominent label to remind pilots about the trim  
 If the trim was incorrec tly set, the pilot should have recognised the situation early in the 
take-off roll and stopped the take -off, as he had done before.  
 The trim required about 25 turns of the handle to move it through its full range.  There 
would have been little time to reset the trim and the pilot would have more likely been 
using both hands to try and control the aeroplane.  
 As the aeroplane headed towards the ground the pilot would have wanted to pull back 
on the elevator and an aft trim would have assisted that and so there would have been 
no need to move the trim forward.  
4.2.13.  Weight and balance calculations confirmed that the weight of ZK-EUF at take -off was 2221  
kg- 17 kg over the maximum allowable weight.  While the overloading  was of  concern, t he 
aeroplane had sufficient power to carry the additional weight, a s acknowledged whe n it was 
permitted to carry up to 2463  kg in the restricted agricultural role.   The weight  (mass)  alone 
was therefore not considered to be an initiator of the accident , but would have incr eased the 
rate of pitch -up after getting airborne . 
4.2.14.  The calculated centre of gravity  during  take-off was 0.122m rear of the aft limit (0.767m  from 
datum)  and may have been further rearward  because the calculation was based on 
conservative figures .  Twelve c entimetres might  not appear to be much, but with a n allowable  
range of 0.428m to 0.645m, or less than 22  centimetres , it was more than 55% rearwards of 
the aft limit and would have had a  detrimental  effect on the controllability of the aeroplane.  
However,  the operator 's trip records indicated that they  had flown 193 parachuting revenue 
flights  in the preceding 2 months , and that 74 of th ose had had 8 parachutists on board .  
4.2.15.  To determine what was different between  the accident flight and the 74 other flight s with 8 
parachutists, a statistical analysis exercise using the Monte Carlo method 13 was undertaken.  
The actual weights of parachutists recorded by 2 other parachuting operators in about a 3-
month period were used, and a base weight of 70.8  kg and a standard deviation of 11.9  kg 
applied. It was assumed that the 2 heaviest tandem masters and 2 heaviest parachutists had 
been  paired and positioned forward of the 2 lighter tandem pairs .  Five thousand  random 
samples were generated and the aft centr e of gravity  limit for ZK -EUF was exceeded on all 
samples .  In 5% of the samples, t he aft limit was exceeded by more than 0.120m.  
4.2.16.  At 0.122m  rear of the aft limit , the centre of gravity  on the accident flight was within the 5% 
grouping , and therefore likely  to have been further aft than the centre of gravity  on nearly all 
previous flights with 8 parachutists .  At a minimum of 0.122m  rear of the aft limit , the centre 
of gravity  on the accident flight  was possibly the most rearward  centre of gravity  of any of the 
aeroplane owner 's previous flights . 
4.2.17.  With 8 persons in the rear of the aeroplane , there w ould have been  little room to move  or slide 
about during the take -off and climb.  There were some  footholds located about the cabin for 
people to use to brace thems elves , and a hand rail along the right inside wall of the aeroplane 
could also have been used.  Video footage of other flights showed no inclination for people to 
slide about  during the take -off roll.  Nevertheless, as the aeroplane continued to pitch up th ere 
would have come a point when the parachutists were not  able to hold on and would have 
                                                        
13 The Monte Carlo method uses a class of computational algorithms based on repeated random sampling.   

<< Page 28 >>
 Report 10 -009 fallen towards the rear of the cabin.  Safety restraints would have prevented this.  By falling to 
the rear of the aeroplane the centre of gravity  would have shifted further aft and made the 
aeroplane  more uncontrollable .  
4.2.18.  The most likely reason for the loss of control was the centre of gravity  being well rear of the aft 
limit, and possibly the most rearward it had ever been.  This may have caught the pilot 
unawares  and the aeroplane became airborne, possibly early  and at too low a speed for the 
pilot to have sufficient elevator control to stop the ensuing pitch -up.  The only option available 
to the pilot at this stage was to close the throttle immediately while the aeroplane was less 
than a few metres into the air.  This window of opportunity was small and some damage and 
injury might still have occu rred. 
Findings  
There were no technical defects identified that may have contributed to the accident 
and the aeroplane wa s considered controllable during the take -off roll, with the engine 
able to deliver power during the short flight.  
The a eroplane 's centre of gravity was at least 0.122m rear of the maximum 
permissible limit, which created a tendency for the nose to pitch u p.  The most likely 
reason for the crash was the a eroplane  being excessively out of balance .  In addition, 
the aeroplane probably  became airborne early and at too low an airspeed to prevent 
uncontrollable nose -up pitch .   
The aeroplane reached a pitch angle that would have made it highly improbable  for 
the unrestrained parachutists to prevent themselves sliding back towards the tail.  Any 
shift in weight rearward would have made the aeroplane more un stable . 
 
4.3. Parachuting co nversion  
4.3.1.  Several variants of the Fletcher FU24 and its derivative the Cresco had been converted to 
parachuting.  The turbine -powered Fletchers provided an economical option for parachuting 
operators to expand their business, provide greater capacity, quick er turn -around times and 
reduced noise footprint when  compared to piston -powered aeroplanes.  ZK -EUF was the fourth 
and most recent Walter Fletcher aeroplane to be converted from an agricultural role to 
parachuting.  The engineering company had been involv ed to varying degrees with each of the 
4 Walter Fletcher conversions.  
4.3.2.  Civil Aviation Rule Part 43 General Maintenance Rules, specifically 43.69 and 43.153, directs 
people performing maintenance or engineering work on an aircraft to correctly record the wor k 
performed.  This is to ensure  that there is an accurate record for the Civil Aviation Authority, 
and other interested individuals or organisations, to confirm the engineering status of the 
aircraft.  The documentation helps interested persons to confirm the airworthiness of the 
aircraft and to confirm compliance with other relevant Civil Aviation Rules.  
4.3.3.  The available evidence indicated the workmanship involved in the conversion of ZK -EUF was 
to a good standard and the aeroplane owner was satisfied with t he finished product.  
However, examination of the engineering documentation associated with the conversion soon 
identified anomalies in the process that meant the aeroplane did not com ply with civil aviation 
rules.  Some examples of these anomalies are desc ribed below .  
4.3.4.  The engineering company had not obtained permission to use several of the modifications 
embodied on the aeroplane, specifically the installation of the top grab rail, the lower fuselage 
steps and the fitment  of the air deflector door as requi red by Civil Aviation Rule 21.  The 
agreement of the owner of a modification was required to ensure the fitment of the 
modification would not have a detrimental effect on the airworthiness of an aircraft.  There 
may have also been financial implications.  
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 29 >>
 4.3.5.  The documentation covering the modification of the aeroplane was incomplete, as no 
reference to the strengthened floor in the passenger cabin was recorded on the CAA Form 337 
and was only to be found in the worksheets.  
4.3.6.  The engineering company had not amende d the aircraft flight manual to allow the opening of a 
door in -flight as required in Civil Aviation Rule Part 91.  The latest weight and balance data 
sheet and oxygen supplements had been inserted in the flight manual, but other than that it 
had not been c hanged to reflect the new role the aeroplane was about to perform.  The flight 
manual now contained obsolete data and information related to its former agricultural role.  
The engineering company should have amended the flight manual as required.  
4.3.7.  The fligh t manual also contained an anomaly in the unusable fuel quantity.  The flight manual 
limitations section stated the total fuel capacity for the aeroplane, including unusable, and the 
usable fuel quantity.  This gave an unusable fuel quantity of 70 litres f or level flight. However, 
the weight and balance data sheet stated 50.5 litres.  Although the latter figure was the result 
of actual testing, the more conservative figure for the Walter Fletcher fleet should have been 
used because this was the CAA -approved  figure.  This anomaly had been there since the 
installation of the Walter engine and possibly reflected a lack of understanding of the civil 
aviation rules by the engineering company.  
Findings  
The engineering company that modified ZK -EUF for parachuting operations did not 
follow the proper processes required by civil aviation rules and guidance.  Two of the 
modifications had been approved for a different aircraft type, one modification 
belonged to another design holder and a fourth  was not referred to in the aircraft 
maintenance logbo ok. 
The flight manual for ZK -EUF had not been updated to reflect the new role of the 
aeroplane  and was limited in its usefulness to the aeroplane owner  for calculating 
weight and balance.  
Regardless of the procedural issues with the project to modify ZK -EUF, the engineering 
work conducted on ZK -EUF to convert it from agricultural to parachuting operations in 
the standard category was by all accounts appropriately  carried out . 
4.4. The operator  
4.4.1.  The purchase and conversion of ZK -EUF by the aeroplane owner  had reflected the growing 
popularity of parachuting, and in particular tandem jumping , both locally and nationally .  The 
use of the Walter  turbine -powered aeroplane had proved successful with other parachuting 
operators , so the aeroplane owner  had assumed that fo llowing the pilots' conversion training 
the aeroplane could immediately be put into operation.  
4.4.2.  The aeroplane owner  had relied  on the engineering company  to complete the modification and 
re-categorisation  of the aeroplane in accordance with the relevant civil aviation rules.  The 
aeroplane owner had not ha d the expertise to check on the engineering company  processes , 
so had accepted the aeroplane along with the incomplete flight manual  without question.  
4.4.3.  The aeroplane owner  had put ZK-EUF into operation  before it had  document ed standard 
operating procedures , which were being written at the time of the accident .  The aeroplane 
owner  had relied on previous experience of operating a piston -powered parachuting aeroplane  
and the information gleaned from  other Wal ter Fletcher parachuting operators.  
4.4.4.  Each flight started with a fuel quantity of 160 litres.  Between 50 and 70 litres would be 
consumed depending on the altitude climbed to, which result ed in a f uel quantity at landing  of 
between 90 litres and  110 litres.  Assuming the best case that 50.5 litres were  unusable and 
using a  typical consumption rate of 160 litres per hour of flying , the amount remaining was 
sufficient for between 1 5 minutes  and 20 minutes of further flight . Using the  CAA-approved 

<< Page 30 >>
 Report 10 -009 figure of 70 litres unusable, the time remaining for flight was half of that (7 to  10 minutes).   
Civil aviation rules required at least 30 minutes to be remaining.  
4.4.5.  The aeroplane owner  accepted the use of a lower  fuel reserve , believing that a flight would 
only take  off in good weather and  that with no other aeroplane operators using the aerodrome 
there was unlikely to be any delay in landing.  This, however, made little allowance for other 
possible situations or emergencies that might have require d the pilo t to remain airborne for 
longer than expected.  The decision to remove the flight manual f rom the aeroplane may also 
have been based on good intentions, but had not been thought through.  The flight manual 
contained relevant aircraft information to which  a pilot might need quick access during flight.   
That is a reason for civil aviation rules requir ing it to be on board.  
4.4.6.  The conversion training for the 2 pilots was adequate and comparable with that for  other 
pilots with similar experience .  The pilot's pre vious turbine experience enabled him to become 
quickly competent in the aeroplane . 
4.6.1  The standard passenger weights appeared suitable for use with ZK-EUF.  The weight of the 9 
people on board ZK -EUF, not including their parachuting rigs, was estimated to be about 640  
kg (71 kg per person) .  An average weight of 71  kg per person was close to th at determined by 
the second parachuting operator that also flew a Walter Fletcher.  The tandem masters in this 
case weigh ed on average about 5  kg more than the passengers , which meant that the 
average weight of the passengers was less than 71  kg. Using  a standard passenger weight 
rather than weighing each person was therefore reasonable . 
4.4.7.  During their conversion training on another FU24 parachute a eroplane , the 2 pilots  had each 
completed several weight and balance calculations for the loads being flown at the time, so 
they were familiar with weight and balance calculations.  The calculation they made would 
have shown them that carrying 8 people in the back of the Walter Fletcher took it close to its 
aft centre of gravity limit.  This should have prompted them to make the same calculations for 
their own a eroplane  instead of assuming the 2 aeroplanes  were the same.  
4.4.8.  The weight and balance data for ZK -EUF varied signif icantly from that in the other 3 Walter 
Fletcher aeroplanes used in parachuting.  It was between 64  kg and 101  kg heavier and had a 
centre of gravity  between 0.066 m and 0.132m further aft.  The basic weight and balance 
calculation s completed by the engineering company  holder w ere consi dered to be accurate.  
The weight difference s between ZK -EUF and the other 3 aeroplanes arose from their different 
agricultural spraying and sowing equipment being fitted to each aeroplane and possible 
additional protec tion to the underside of the aeroplane .  These  had all added weight further 
aft. 
4.4.9.  Had the  aeroplane owner  completed a weight and balance calculation  for ZK -EUF, even using 
average weights and the chart and information available in the flight manual, they would have 
found that the aeroplane was near  its maximum allowable weight and outside the aft centre of 
gravity  limit for all loads involving 8 parachutists.  
Findings  
The weight and balance of the aeroplane , with its centre of gravity at least 0. 122m 
outside  the maximum aft limit , would have caused serious handling issues for the pilot 
and was the most significant factor contributing to the accident.  
ZK-EUF was 17  kg over its maximum permissible weight on the accident flight, but was 
still 242  kg lighter than the maximum all -up weight  for which the a eroplane  was 
certified in its previous agricultural role.  Had the aeroplane not been out of balance it 
is considered the excess weight in itself would have been  unlikely to cause the 
accident.  Nevert heless,  the pilots should have made a full weight and balance 
calculation  before each flight . 
The aeroplane owner  and their  pilots  did not comply with civil aviation rules and did 
not follow good , sound aviation practice by failing to conduct weight and ba lance 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 31 >>
 calculations  on the a eroplane . This resulted in the a eroplane  being routinely flown 
overweight and outside the aft centre of gravity allowable limit whenever it carried 8 
parachutists.  
The empty weight and balance for ZK -EUF was properly recorded in the flight manual, 
but the stability information in that manual had not been appropriately amended to 
reflect its new role of a parachute a eroplane . Nevertheless , it was still possible for the 
aeroplane operator to  initially  have calculated the weight and balance of the 
aeroplane  for the predicted operational loads before entering the a eroplane  into 
service.  
The aeroplane owner  did not comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow good , 
sound aviation practice when  they: used the incorrect amount of fuel reserves ; 
removed the flight manual from the a eroplane ; and did not formulat e their  own 
standard operating procedures before using the a eroplane  for commercial 
parachuting operations.  
4.5. The role of the regulator  
4.5.1.  The conversion of ZK -EUF for parachuting  involved the removal of its agricultural equipment 
and the installation of a number of STCs and modifications - both major and minor.  The 
Walter Fletcher was originally certified in both the restricted and standard air worthiness 
categories.  The conversion of the aeroplane, therefore, did not require a new type certificate  
to be issued but did in the opinion of the Commission require the CAA to ensure  that the work 
had been  correctly carried out.  
4.5.2.  The Director of Civil A viation delegated the function of approving design changes to "certified 
design organisations " that employed CAA "design delegation holder s" as "senior person s".  
The Director  also delegated the function  of oversight of the modification work  to engineers 
with "inspection authori sations ".  The Director was able to delegate these functions under 
section 23B of the Civil Aviation Act.  The delegations made those organisations and persons 
accountable to the Director for that work, but in the opinion o f the Commission did not absolve 
the Director's responsibility.  Just as an organi sation is responsible for the performance of its 
contractors, so too was the Director responsible for  ensuring these delegation holders were 
performing the tasks in line with  civil aviation rules and good , sound aviation engineering 
practice.  It was incumbent on th e Director therefore to maintain some form of control or 
oversight of the STC and modification process es. 
4.5.3.  In this case the engineering company contracted a certified design organisation, and its chief 
engineer held an inspection authority.  This meant that the engineering company could have in 
effect submit ted its own data to assess itself, approve d that data as acceptable, classif ied the 
modification as mi nor or major and , if major, certif ied conformity with  the Civil Aviation  Rules, 
undertake n the work and sign ed off the work using its own inspection authority. If it had not 
been for the requirement to return the aircraft to the standard category, all of t his could have 
taken place without recourse to the CAA.  
4.5.4.  The CAA said that i n approving the change in airworthiness category  it was only concerned 
that the aeroplane was airworthy and  that the 2 STC modifications had been embodied  (the 
requirement for a fue l drain and the installation of an  alternate air intake door to the engine) .  
It was not the CAA's  role under the relevant rule to approve the role or use of an aircraft. The 
CAA said that the responsib ility for ensur ing the aeroplane was safe to fly  rested with the 
aircraft owner .   
4.5.5.  There are 2 issues with this approach.  The first is that the aeroplane owner  did not , and was 
not required to , have the expertise to judge whether the modification was appropriate.  Like 
the Director, the aeroplane owner  left that to the engineering company  and the design 
delegation holder to exercise their obligations and requirements under the Rules as they saw 
fit.  The second issue is that the parachuting operation was essentially unregulated.  

<< Page 32 >>
 Report 10 -009 4.5.6.  The information requeste d from the engineering company  by the CAA was adequate as a basis 
for approv ing the change in airworthiness category, provided the information  was complete 
and correct.  The CAA was subsequently satisfied that the requirements had been  met and 
approved the change in category.  While this was in accordance with the current rules and 
practi ces, an opportunity was not taken by  the CAA to review the full documentation provided 
to help ensure that the aeroplane owner , who had never flown a tu rbine -powered aircraft 
before, was about to operate an aeroplane that was fit for purpose.  Had the CAA done so it 
might  have noted  that there w as both incorrect and missing documentation.  It might  also 
have required the flight manual to be amended to ens ure that it contained  the information 
that pilots required in order to operate the aeroplane safely, such as the procedure s for 
opening  a door in -flight and  for calculat ing the centre of gravity . 
4.5.7.  This accident highlighted how critical it is for a regulator  to maintain a good oversight of the 
modification and airworthiness of aircraft.  Special -purpose aircraft, especially those 
undergoing one -off type modifications, require d additional attention to ensure airworthiness 
standards were  maintained.  
4.5.8.  The Commission considered the question, should major modifications and STCs be referred 
back to the original type certificate holder?  The Commission considered this from a safety and 
standards point of view and has not taken commercial considerations into  account.  To help 
with this question  a comparison was made with how other countries deal t with the issue.  The 
process in New Zealand was found to be similar to those of other countries that manufacture 
aircraft.  
4.5.9.  In New Zealand the Director of Civil Aviat ion can require a design delegation holder to consult 
the type certificate owner over a major modification or STC, but this is entirely at the Director's 
discretion  (Rule Part 21.123) .  If the designer has sufficient data to consider  adequately  what 
effect  a modification would have on the aircraft in line with civil aviation rules, it might not be 
necessary to consult the type certificate holder.  However , it would seem the prudent thing to 
do in some cases to alleviate any doubt.  
4.5.10.  There are analogies with a lmost all other modes of transport . When someone is wanting to 
modify a car, bus, train or ship  they are rarely required to consult the manufacturer  first.  
There is usually the simple requirement that after modification the vehicle must meet the 
standards  of the day.  
4.5.11.  The CAA now says that it would not approve a similar conversion in the future without ensuring 
that the modifications were applicable to the aircraft being converted and  that the flight 
manual was amended to reflect the new role.  The CAA now says also that some of the 
modifications made when  converting ZK -EUF to parachuting should have been completed as 
STCs rather than  as major modifications.  The CAA's amendment of the conditions governing 
all design delegation holders , while it primarily was intended to align New Zealand with best 
international practice, should result in better management  of the STC and modification  
process .  The design delegation holder amendment was issued on 24 August 2010, after ZK -
EUF had been modified but before the accident.  This has been acknowledged as a safety 
action that would otherwise have resulted in  a recommendation by the Commission.  
Findings  
The Director of Civil Aviation delegated the task of assessing and overseeing major 
modifications to Rule Part 146 design organisations and individual holders of 
"inspection authorisations ".  The delegations did not absolve the Director of his 
responsibility to monitor complianc e with civil aviation rules and guidance.  
The delegations increased the risk that unless properly managed the CAA could lose  
control of 2 safety -critical functions : design and inspection .  The Director had not 
appropriately managed  that risk with the curre nt oversight program me. 
 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 33 >>
 The CAA had adhered strictly to its normal practice and was acting in accordance with 
civil aviation rules when approving the change in airworthiness  category from special 
to standard.  However, knowing the scope, size and complexi ty of the modifications 
required to change ZK -EUF from an agricultural to a parachuting aeroplane , it should 
have had greater participation in the process to help ensure there were no safety 
implications.  
There was a flaw in the regulatory system that allowed an engineering company 
undertaking major modification work on an aircraft to have little or no  CAA 
involvement by using an internal or contracted design delegation holder and a person 
with the inspecti on authorisation to oversee and sign off the work.  
4.6. Regulatory oversight of the parachuting industry  
4.6.1.  Parachuting operators  were not certificated and  there were no rules that fully governed the 
operation , other than Rule Part 105 and the common general oper ating rules of Part 91.  
Parachuting operators were, therefore, not subject to inspections and audits.  The CAA had not 
established a risk profile for the industry . 
4.6.2.  With nearly 100 000 tandem jumps being undertaken annually, the parachuting industry had 
grown significantly in recent years.  New parachuting operations had been established to meet 
the increased demand, and previously small, mainly recreational, operators had expanded into 
medium -sized commercial businesses.  The CAA had recognised this evolut ion and had 
identified the need to develop rules to better regulate these operations.  However, in the 
meantime these operations had flourished unchecked.  
4.6.3.  Some  parachuting  operators were flying larger and more powerful aircraft, often carrying more 
passeng ers, than some certificated small commuter operator s. Despite this the CAA directed 
minimal additional resources towards  ensur ing the safe conduct of these activities  throughout 
the long process of developing a rule .  The biennial visits by the CAA aviatio n safety adviser 
were irregular and informal, and would not have identified the causal factors that led to this 
accident.  
4.6.4.  The United States special report on parachuting operators highlighted 3 recurring safety 
issues that were relevant to the parachuting industry in New Zealand in general and this 
accident in particular.  These issues included aircraft maintenance, pilot performance and 
regulatory oversight.  
4.6.5.  Commercial parachuting operations were based on repetitive , short -cycle flights that involved 
extended high -power settings for the climb s, immediately followed by rapid descents.  This 
placed increased demands on aircraft and engines that, with the possible exception of 
topdressing, might not otherwise normally have occur red.  Although no technical  failure was 
identified in this accident, operators and pilots need to ensure that aircraft are correctly 
maintained and operated at all times.  The CAA also needs to be actively involved with  the 
industry to ensure that proper maintenance practices are ad hered to.  
4.6.6.  The Walter Fletcher was a different type of aeroplane from  the Cessna aeroplane the owner  
had flown before.  It was heavier, more powerful, able to carry more parachutists and capable 
of reaching drop altitude s more quick ly.  It also had a turbin e engine that required different 
handling skills and, because of the flight profile adopted by the aeroplane operator, it had to 
be refuel led between each load.  The introduction of the aeroplane into service therefore 
needed to be carefully managed.  
4.6.7.  The p ilot of ZK -EUF was considered to be a competent pilot.  He was experienced in the 
parachuting role and had recently completed conversion training that had included several 
parachute -drop flights under the observation of an instructor.  He was, therefore, c urrent as a 
parachuting pilot.   

<< Page 34 >>
 Report 10 -009 4.6.8.  Pilots were required to undergo regular checks to ensure that their general aircraft piloting 
skills, emergency drills and aviation and aircraft knowledge were up to standard.  However, 
once a pilot had obtained a parachute -drop  rating, provided they maintained their currency by 
completing 6 parachute drops in the preceding 12 months, there was no requirement for an 
independent check by a qualified examiner.  
4.6.9.  The operator was not certificated .  Parachuting, like other adventu re aviation activities, was 
not subject to the same CAA regulatory oversight that applied to commercial air operators.  
The CAA was  relying on the implementation of Rule Part 115 to help ensure  that these types of 
operator developed appropriate procedures and were part of the safety audit process.  The 
introduction of Rule Part 115 had, however, suffered several delays over the years  but entered 
into force on 10 November 2011 ( refer to  the "Safety action s" section of the report for more 
detail) . 
4.6.10.  The Director of Civil Aviation believed he had limited powers under the C ivil Aviation  Act to 
regulate parachuting activities . The Commission agree s that there were some limitations, but 
the mechanism was there in section 15(1)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act, whi ch gives  the Director 
the power to require any person that : 
". . .operates , maintains, or services, or does any other act in respect of any aircraft, 
aeronautical product, aviation -related service, air traffic service, or aeronautical 
procedure to undergo or carry out such inspections and such monitoring as the 
Director sees necessary in the interests of civil aviation safety and security. " 
4.6.11.  The limitation  was that the Director , in exercising a special power , would need to have a 
reasonable belief that the i nterests of civil aviation  safety were at risk.  To form that belief 
someone would have  had to bring  the matter to his attention if it was no t covered by routine 
monitoring. T he operation of parachute -drop  aircraft  was not covered by routine monitoring 
and nothing untoward with the operation had been notified to the Director , so he had had no 
reason to intervene . 
4.6.12.  Alternatively, u nder the designation for the CAA to administer the HSE Act,  ZK-EUF was the 
place of work for the pilot and tandem masters involved in the accident.  Certain aspects of 
the Fox Glacier aerodrome operation also came under this  purview if the safety of those on 
board the aircraft were  compromised by some act or omiss ion. They, like the operator, were 
subject to the HSE Act and therefore had a collective responsibility to ensure it was a safe 
working environment.  As the designated authority to administer the HSE Act for the aviation 
sector, the CAA also had an obligat ion to promote safe work practices and educate 
participants and aviation document holders - operators and licensed and qualified personnel 
such as pilots and tandem masters.  
4.6.13.  The CAA did make available material such as the Good Aviation Practice publication s, to help 
educate pilots and operators generally.  Included within this series of publications was the 
"Weight and Balance " booklet that the aeroplane owner reported he had never read.  
4.6.14.  The CAA's HSE Unit had sampled the parachuting industry in anticipatio n of the adoption of 
the new Rule Part 115.  With their limited experience and focus, the HSE  Unit staff members 
were limited to looking at personal safety issues , which they considered to be of a good 
standard.  As a result no concerns were raised for fur ther investigation.  
4.6.15.  The HS E Unit focused its attention on personal responsibil ity, while operational responsibility 
was left to be overseen by the CAA's audit, inspection, safety information and enforcement 
personnel.  The HSE Unit was able to undertake so me 30 audits per year , and with more than  
400 certificated organisations the priority was understandably  to focus on those sectors or 
operators that were at greater risk  or had the potential for greater injury, for example medium 
and large passenger aircraft .  These were identified through the CAA's risk management 
scheme and were generally part of the CAA's regular audit programme.  
 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 35 >>
 4.6.16.  As far as the HSE Act is concerned , there is no d ifferentiation  between operational safety and 
personal safety.  If an operational safety matter affected the safety of employees in the 
workplace, the Director had the power to intervene under his designation.  Given the growth in 
the parachuting industry and the length  of time taken to develop Rule Part 115, this would 
have  been a prudent measure.  
 
 
 
 
4.7. Performance -impairing substances  
4.7.1.  Although the consumption/ingestion of cannabis was not contributory to th is accident, the 
presence of THC in 2 of the tandem masters, albeit one of very low level, was a concern. T he 
tandem masters on  board ZK -EUF were not crew  members of the aeroplane.  However, a 
parachute when in use was considered by the CAA to be an aircraft  and the  tandem masters  
each held a rating issued under C ivil Aviation Rules.  They were therefore subject to Rule Part 
19.7, prohibiting the use of performance -impairi ng substance s. 
4.7.2.  The role of tandem master was critical to the safe conduct of a parachuting descent .  Tandem 
masters , like pilots,  needed to be fully alert to conduct their routine duties and react  
appropriately in case of an emergency.  All transport modes have complex tasks, and 
participants need to  be fully fit and healthy to complete those tasks  safely . 
4.7.3.  Although the intent of Rule 19.7 is clear , the matter of what impairment means is subjective in 
the absence of any laws that prescribe limits , such as  those  in existence for alcohol and road 
users.  The issue has been raised in other Commission reports ( such as  marine report 09-201) 
and a recommendation made to the Secretary for Transport to address the issue.   
Finding  
An alcohol and drug testing regime needs to be initiated for persons performing 
activities critical to flight safety,  to detect and  deter the use of performance -impairing 
substances . 
4.8. Safety restraints  
4.8.1.  Proper safety  restraints have been shown to reduce flailing injuries and save lives in those 
accidents deemed survivable.  However, the impact forces sustained when ZK -EUF struck the 
ground in a near -vertical angle would  not been survivable even if typical safety harne sses  had 
been fitted and worn . 
4.8.2.  Even if the parachutists had been wearing safety restraints , it is unlikely this would have 
prevented the accident , because the evidence suggests the aircraft became uncontrollable as 
soon as it became airborne.  The passenge rs in the back would not likely have slid towards the 
tail until the aircraft had pitched up to a steep angle, at which point it would have been 
unrecoverable at such a low altitude.  
4.8.3.  The reluctance of some parachutists to wear safety restraints for fear of  getting caught up was 
based on others' experiences and was understandable.  Any enforced requirement to wear Findings  
The level of parachuting activity in New Zealand warranted a stronger level of 
regulatory oversight than had been applied in recent years.  
The CAA's oversight and surveillance of commercial parachuting were not adequate to 
ensure that operators were functioning in a safe manner.  
The CAA had mechanisms through the Director's powers under the Civil Aviation Act 
and his designated powers under the HSE Act to effectively regulate the parachuting 
industry pending the introduction of Rule Part 115.  

<< Page 36 >>
 Report 10 -009 restraints risks being ignored as a result.  Single -point restraints may stop people sliding 
about, but have proven not to be effective in moderat e and high -energy accidents.   
4.8.4.  The joint study by the FAA and U nited States Parachute Assoc iation , when completed, may 
provide guidance on what, if any, form of safety restraint may promote accident survivability 
for parachutists.  Meanwhile the Commission's safety recommendation on the matter remains 
open until further work has been completed to weigh the benefits against the cost s. 
Findings  
In this case the impact was not survivable and the passengers wearing safety 
restraints would not have prevented their deaths, but in other circumstances the 
wearing of safety restraints might  reduce injuries and save lives.  
Safety harnesses or restraints would help  to prevent passengers sliding rearward a nd 
altering the centre of gravity of the aircraft.  It could not be established if this was a 
factor in this accident . 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 37 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. There were no technical defects identified that may have contributed to the accident and the 
aerop lane was considered controllable during the take -off roll, with the engine able to deliver 
power during the short flight.  
5.2. The aeroplane's centre of gravity was at least 0.122m rear of the maximum permissible limit, 
which created a tendency for the nose to pitch up.  The most likely reason for the crash was 
the aeroplane being excessively out of balance . In addition, the aeroplane probably became 
airborne early and at too low an airspeed to prevent uncontrollable nose -up pitch .   
5.3. The aeroplane reached a pitc h angle that would have made it highly improbable  for the 
unrestrained parachutists to prevent themselves sliding back towards the tail.  Any shift in 
weight rearward would have made the aeroplane more un stable.  
5.4. The engineering company that modified ZK -EUF for parachuting operations did not follow 
proper processes required by civil aviation rules and guidance.  Two of the modifications had 
been approved for a different aircraft type, one modification belonged to another design 
holder and a fourth  was not re ferred to in the aircraft maintenance logbook.  
5.5. The flight manual for ZK -EUF had not been updated to reflect the new role of the aeroplane 
and was limited in its usefulness to the aeroplane owner  for calculating weight and balance.  
5.6. Regardless of the procedural issues with the project to modify ZK -EUF, the engineering work 
conducted on ZK -EUF to convert it from agricultural to parachuting operations in the standard 
category was by all accounts appropriately carried out.  
5.7. The weight and  balance of the aeroplane , with its centre of gravity at least 0.122m outside the 
maximum aft limit , would have caused serious handling issues for the pilot and was the most 
significant factor contributing to the accident.  
5.8. ZK-EUF was 17  kg over its maximum  permissible weight on the accident flight, but was still 
242 kg lighter than the maximum all -up weight  for which the aeroplane was certified in its 
previous agricultural role.  Had the aeroplane not been out of balance it is considered the 
excess weight i n itself would have been  unlikely to cause the accident.  Nevertheless,  the 
pilots should have made a full weight and balance c alculation  before each flight.  
5.9. The aeroplane owner  and their  pilots did not comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow 
good, sound aviation practice by failing to conduct weight and balance c alculations  on the 
aeroplane . This  resulted in the aeroplane being routinely flown overweight and outside the aft 
centre of gravity allowable limit whenever it carried 8 parachutists.  
5.10.  The empty weight and balance for ZK -EUF was properly recorded in the flight manual, but the 
stability information in that manual had not been appropriately amended to reflect its new role 
of a parachute aeroplane . Nevertheless , it was still possible for the  aeroplane operator to 
initially have calculated the weight and balance of the aeroplane for the predicted operational 
loads before entering the aeroplane into service.  
5.11.  The aeroplane owner  did not comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow good , sound 
aviation practice when they: used the incorrect amount of fuel reserves ; removed the flight 
manual from the aeroplane ; and did not formulate their  own standard operating procedures 
before using the aeroplane for commercial parachuting operations . 
5.12.  The Director of Civil Aviation delegated the task of assessing and overseeing major 
modifications to Rule Part 146 design organisations and individual holders of "inspection 
authorisations ".  The delegations did not absolve the Director of his responsibility t o monitor 
compliance with civil aviation rules and guidance.  

<< Page 38 >>
 Report 10 -009 5.13.  The delegations increased the risk that unless properly managed  the CAA could lose  control of 
2 safety -critical functions : design and inspection .  The Director had not appropriately managed  
that risk with the current oversight program me. 
5.14.  The CAA had adhered strictly to its normal practice and was acting in accordance with civil 
aviation rules when approving the change in airworthiness  category from special to standard.  
However, knowing the scope, size and complexity of the modifications required to change ZK -
EUF from an agricultural to a parachuting aeroplane , it should have had greater participation 
in the process to help ensure there were no safety implications.  
5.15.  There was a flaw in the reg ulatory system that allowed an engineering company undertaking 
major modification work on an aircraft to have little or no CAA involvement by using an internal 
or contracted design delegation holder and a person with the inspection authorisation to 
oversee  and sign off the work . 
5.16.  The level of parachuting activity in New Zealand warranted a stronger level of regulatory 
oversight than had been applied in recent years . 
5.17.  The CAA's oversight and surveillance of commercial parachuting were  not adequate to ensure 
that operators were functioning in a safe manner.  
5.18.  The CAA had mechanisms through the Director's powers under the Civil Aviation Act and his 
designated powers under the HSE Act to effectively regulate the parachuting industry pending 
the introduction of Rule Part 115 . 
5.19.  An alcohol and drug testing regime needs to be initiated for persons performing activities 
critical to flight safety, to detect and deter the use of performance -impairing substances . 
5.20.  In this case the impact was not survivable and the passengers w earing safety restraints would 
not have prevented their deaths, but in other circumstances the wearing of safety restraints 
might  reduce injuries and save lives.  
5.21.  Safety harnesses or restraints would help  to prevent passengers sliding rearward and altering 
the centre of gravity of the aircraft.  It could not be established if this was a factor in this 
accident.

 6. Safety a ctions  
6.1. General  
6.1.1.  The Commission classifies safety actions by 2 types:  
(a) safety  actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to addres s other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
6.1.2.  The following safety actions are not listed in any order of priority.  
6.2. Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2.1.  On 11 October 2011 t he Minister of Transport signed the new Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 
Adventure Aviation (Certification and Operations).  Part 115 (initial issue) entered into force on 
10 November 2011.  Transitional arrangements in Part 115 require commercial tandem 
parac hute and parachute -drop  aircraft operators conducting operations immediately before 
10 November 2011 to comply with Part 115 by 1 May 2012.   CAA resources have been 
increased as a result.  
  

<< Page 40 >>
 Report 10 -009 7. Recommendations  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to the person s or 
organisation s that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues . 
7.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help preven t similar accidents or incidents.  
7.2. Recommendations  
7.2.1.  On 13 September 2010 the Commission made the following urgent safety recommendations:  
7.2.2.  The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation as a matter of urgency alerts 
all pilots and operators usi ng the Fletcher FU24 -954 aircraft for parachuting operations that 
when loaded with 6 or more passengers it is possible for the aircraft CG to be aft of the 
allowable limit, and that this could result in control difficulties, and that parachutists should be  
seated in the forward cabin area, preferably restrained to prevent them inadvertently moving 
rearward.  (037/10)  
On 20 September 2010  the General Manager of the General Aviation Group of the CAA  replied  
in part : 
As we have already advised the Commission, the CAA issued Emergency 
Airworthiness Directive (AD) DCA/FU24/179 on 11 September 2010, to address 
the safety issues that you identify in your letter.  The AD was sent immediately to 
all operators of Fletcher series aircraft conducting parachute operation s.  We 
accept that this is based on information gained early in the investigation and the 
issue of the A D should be considered to be immediate interim action pending 
completion of your investigation.  
AD DCA/FU24/179 Parachuting Operations - Limitation and C of C 
Determination  requires;  
1. Amen dment of the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) to restrict maximum 
occupancy of the cabin aft of F.S 118.84 to six persons.  This may be 
accomplished by inserting a copy of the AD into the AFM adjacent to the 
applicable supple ment for parachuting operations.  
2. No parachuting operation is to be conducted with any number of occupants, 
unless for each individual flight:  
a. A weight and balance calculation is performed to establish that the 
aircraft Centre of Gravity will remain within AFM limits for the 
duration of the flight, and  
b. The calculation uses actual weights for all occupants and their 
equipment, and  
c. The calculation accounts for the positions of all occupants.  The 
occupants' positions shall be taken as the most aft positions th at 
result from the rearmost members of the group sitting against the 
aft cabin wall and subsequent occupants located immediately 
forward of them, unless a means of restraint is provided to prevent 
the occupants moving rearwards  from their normal position, and  
d. A record of the Centre of Gravity determination is kept for each 
parachuting operation.  
The effective date of the AD is 11 September 2010 and compliance with 1 and 2 
above is required before further parachute -drop operations and before every 
parachute -drop operation, respectively.  
 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 41 >>
 7.2.3.  The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation as a matter of urgency reviews 
the approvals granted for the FU24 -954 aircraft with a view to amending the Flight Manual to 
allow more accurate determinations of aircraft centre of gravity.  This review should also 
extend to other conversions of Fletcher and Cresco aircraft.  (038/10)  
On 20 September 2010 the General Manager of  the General Aviation Group of the CAA  replied  
in part : 
The CAA intends to issue a further  Emergency Airworthiness Directive 
(DCA/FU24/180 Parachuting - Flight Manual Supplement Approval) to be 
applicable to all FU24 series aircraft modified to conduct parachute operations.  
It will address the issue that it may be possible in some parachute co nfigurations 
to exceed the aircraft's aft Centre of Gravity limit.  In doing so, CAA will review all 
AFM parachute operation supplements, including those approved by delegation 
holders or foreign authorities to ensure that they provide adequate determinati on 
of the Centre of Gravity position.  
In addition to the A Ds, CAA has commenced a broader safety review of 
parachuting operations, to establish if there are other safety issues arising.  The 
review includes existing parachuting flight manual supplements, p ilot training 
and type ratings for FU24 series aircraft, the provision of operational information 
to pilots , clarification of aircraft loading limitations and a review of the necessity 
of seating and/or restraint systems  for parachutists.  
7.2.4.  On 22 March 2012,  the Commission  made the following  recommend ations  to the Director of 
Civil Aviation:  
The modification of ZK-EUF by the engineering company  was not in keeping with required  
engineering practices and the supporting documentation was both incomplete and inaccurate .  
The Commission recommends the Director takes the necessary action that ensures  that high 
engineering standards are maintained  by this and other aircraft maintenance organisations  
(005/12). 
The operator's fuel management policy, control of the flight manual and failure to ensure  the 
aeroplane was being operated within its centre of gravity  limits may be an indication  of wider 
non-compliance issues.  The Commission recommends that t he Director takes the necessary 
action  that ensures all parachuti ng operators are conforming to Civil Aviation  Rules and 
operating safely  (006/12). 
In approving the change in airworthiness category, the CAA did not review all the  required 
documentation and so missed the opportunity to ensure the aeroplane was  fit for th e purpose.  
The Commission recommends that t he Director takes the necessary action that ensures  there 
is a thorough and  coordinated oversight when accepting aircraft modifications and approving 
changes in category, especially for speciali sed operations lik e parachuting ( 007/12). 
The wearing of appropriate seat restraints can reduce injury and save lives.  The Commission 
recommends that the Director  monitor the outcome  of the joint FAA/USPA study and 
determine if any findings  are applicable for the New Zealand parachuting industry  (008/12). 
The owner 's introduction into service of ZK -EUF was not in accordance with Civil Aviation rules 
and there was no assistance or oversight provided by the CAA to ensure it was safely 
complete d.  The Commission recommends that the Director ensure there is a coordinated and 
proactive approach by relevant departments within the CAA to ensure safety efforts are best 
directed to promote the coordinated safe management of flying activities  (009/12). 
Parachut e-drop pilots can fly for many years without external validation of their parachuting  
related skills.  The Commission recommends that t he Director initiate a regular checking 
requirement  to help ensure drop pilots remain skilled and curren t, simil ar to other commercial 
operators  (010/12). 
 

<< Page 42 >>
 Report 10 -009 7.2.5.  On 13 April 2012  the General Manager of the Safety Information Group of the CAA replied : 
(005/12)  Accepted.  Newly introduced risk based surveillance processes will 
improve the effectiveness of the CAA's audits,  through better targeting and focus 
on 'risk issues'.  
(006/12)  Accepted.  Following the accident, the CAA carried out a series of spot 
checks on commercial parachuting operations, paying particular attention to 
flight manual data and the application of we ight and balance limitations.  In 
addition to this activity, the implementation of Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 
(Adventure Aviation) will require tandem parachute operators to be certificated, 
and enable closer oversight of such operations.  
(007/12)  See Comment.  This recommendation addresses 2 separate issues.  
First, with respect the review of documentation required for a change from 
'restricted' to 'standard' category, the Director will consider whether physical 
aeroplane inspections are warranted when an aircraft changes category.  
However, the resources and other implications of such inspections will need to 
be identified and evaluated before the Director accepts the recommendation in 
full.   
Second, with respect to aircraft modification s, the CAA has amended the con ditions of all 
design delegation holders, which has the effect of the CAA being able to exercise closer 
oversight of any major design changes.  These changes took effect on 24 August 2010.  
(008/12)  Accepted.  The Director wil l monitor the outcome of th e joint FAA/USPA 
study, and consider their applicability/relevance to the New Zealand aviation 
environment.  
(009/12)  See comment.  The CAA is currently undergoing a major change 
programme to ensure that it is able to target its resources more effectively, and 
conduct its activities more consistently.  To this end, the thrust of the 
recommendation is accepted.  
The CAA also notes that the introduction of Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 will enable the CAA to 
exercise closer oversight of organisations conducting commercial parachute operations, which 
in part address elements of the recommendation.  
(010/12)  See comment.  The Director will consider the recommendation in light 
of the changes that are being brought about by the introductio n of Civil Aviation 
Rule Part 115.  
7.2.6.  On 22 March 2012 the Commission made the following recommendation to the Secretary for 
Transport:  
The use of performance impairing substances is known to have a detrimental effect on the 
ability of people to safely operate in critical transport environments.  The Commission 
recommends that the  Secretary for Transport  promotes the introduction of a drug and alcohol 
detection and deterrence regime for persons employed in safety critical transport roles 
(011/12) . 
On 3 M ay 2012, the General Manager Aviation and Maritime replied, in part : 
I accept the specific recommendation 011/12 directed to the Secretary for 
Transport.  
I also urge the Commission to note the existing health and safety in employment 
regulatory regime, whe re drugs and alcohol are specifically mentioned in the 
definition of "hazard". This regime already places obligations on both employers 
and employees.  
Since the Fox Glacier accident the Minister of Transport has approved a new Rule 
Part 115 that entered in to force in November 2011.  The Rule requires 
adventure aviation operations to be certified by 1 May 2012.  Adventure aviation 
organisations, including commercial parachuting, now face the risk that their 
safety certification can be suspended and removed f or safety violations. This 
 
Report 10 -009 
<< Page 43 >>
 gives such operators a stronger incentive to ensure they address alcohol and 
drug taking safety risks in their organisations.  
Over the next two years the Government will be considering rule amendments 
that would require aviation organisations to introduce safety management 
systems.  This would require certificated operators to assess and mitigate all 
safety risks relevant to their operation.  This risk of intoxication of personnel by 
drugs and alcohol would clearly be a safety ris k that we would expect both 
operators and the Civil Aviation Authority (when certifying and auditing aviation 
organisations) to be actively addressing under an SMS regime.  Decisions will 
also be made in the near future to ensure that the Civil Aviation Au thority is 
resourced to transition to the ICAO -endorsed SMS approach which has 
widespread industry support.  
Whilst recognising that where the illegal use of drugs is involved, changing 
individual behaviour will be challenging, the Ministry will encourage t he Civil 
Aviation Authority to step up its effort to alert the aviation community through 
education of the risks that drugs pose to the safety operation of aviation 
undertakings.  This will require an ongoing effort.  
As you are aware, the Ministry has dev eloped a Transport Regulatory Policy 
Statement that specific rule changes may not always be the best interventions to 
achieve desire safety outcomes.  Non -regulatory interventions can often be more 
appropriate.  In this regard we appreciate the Commission' s recommendation to 
promote a drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regime, rather than to 
implement a regime.  
The Ministry of Transport has in the past sponsored an inter -agency Substance 
Impairment Group.  This looked at whether or not compulsory ran dom drug and 
alcohol testing, and specific breath alcohol limits, should be required by 
regulation in the aviation, marine and rail transports modes.  In part because of a 
lack of data, we were not convinced at that time that the costs would outweigh 
the b enefits.  We will, however, monitor international experience in this regard 
and, in particular, the recent relevant changes in the Australian aviation regime.

 Report 10 -009 8. Key lessons  
8.1. The investigation findings and recommendations provided reminders of the following practices 
that contribute to aviation safety:  
 no 2  aircraft of the same model are exactly the same , even if they look that way; 
therefore pilots must do weight and balance calculations for every individual aeroplane  
and before each flight  
 modifying aircraft is a safety -critical process that must be done in strict accordance with 
rules and guidelines and with appropriate regulatory oversight  
 good rules, regulations  and recommended practices are key to ensuring safe commercial 
aviation operations  
 opera tors need to ensure that aircraft are being operated in accordance with prescribed 
rules and guidelines, and flown within their operating limitations  
 aircraft operations need to be accompanied by relevant and robust procedures  
 maintaining flight safety requires active participation by all sectors of the industry and a 
co-ordinated pro-approach  by all elements of the regulator.

 Report 10 -009 Appendix 1:   Weight and balance calculations  
1. A standard fuel weight of 90  kg was used, based on the reported normal fuel load of 160 litres 
for each flight and making a small allowance for fuel used for the start and taxi.  The 160 litres 
included the 50.5 litres unusable fuel shown in th e weight and balance data sheet and that was 
included in the 1407  kg basic weight of the aeroplane.  A conversion figure of 0.8168  kg per 
litre was used as this was the figure used by the STC holder during the weight and balance 
calculations on completion of the modifications in June.14  The tandem parachuting rig for each 
tandem pair was known to weigh 20  kg.  For this calculation, the 20  kg was distributed between 
the tandem master (15  kg) and passenger (5  kg). 
2. The first calculation used the loading chart contained in the flight manual, with an average pilot 
and passenger weight of 70  kg, plus the weight of the equipment.  For the calculations, 4 
parachutists were considered to be positioned about the hopper and 4 parachutists positioned 
about the cargo doo r.  To calculate the final arm or centre of gravity  position, the total moment 
was divided by the total weight.  The calculation was as follows:  
 
 
3. The second calculation used the same loading chart, but with individual pilot, tandem master 
and passenger weights based on autopsy reports and medical records where available.  The 
heaviest 2 tandem master and passenger combinations were assumed to be at the front. 
Where exact weights were not available, the estimated weights were rounded down.  The figures 
were as follows:  
Item  Weight (kg)  Arm (m)  Moment (kg -m) 
Empty Weight  1407  +0.446  +627.522

 4. A further series of centre of gravity  calculations w as made using the  distributed seating 
locations when 4 tandem masters and 4 passengers were carried.  Seating positions were 
based on the information provided by the operator, i ncluding video recordings of previous flights 
with 4 tandem pairs, and measurements obtained with the assistance of other Walter Fletcher 
parachuting operators.  The first calculation used an average weight of 70  kg per person, plus 
15 kg for each tandem m aster and 5  kg for each passenger.  The figures were as follows:  
Item  Weight (kg)  Arm (m)  Moment (kg -m) 
Empty weight  1407  +0.446  +627.522  
Pilot     75 -0.056  -4.2
