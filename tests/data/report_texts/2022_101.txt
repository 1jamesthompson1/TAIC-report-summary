Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmen tal Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The Commission 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include  making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
Tuhinga  whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1 At about 0602, on 11  May 2022 , the Capital Connection  express  passenger train was at  
the platform of Palmerston North station  when the train manager discovered a fire on 
board the auxil iary generator wagon1. 
1.2 All passenger  carriage s were immediately evacuated  before  the doors were closed to 
prevent re-entry.   
1.3 The train manager  contacted Fire and Emergency New Zealand  to report the fire  and a  
fire appliance responded. On arrival firefighters observed a small fire in the auxiliary 
generator  wagon, which they extinguished with a carbon dioxide portable fire 
extinguisher.  
1.4 There were no injuries,  and the  fire damage was contained to the top box2 and ceiling 
of the auxiliary generator  wagon . 
Why it happened  
1.5 The fire was  accidental and  likely  caused by the proximity of the exhaust tail pipe to 
the internal ceiling  lining  of the wagon .  
1.6 The likelihood  of a fire in the auxiliary generator  wagon had increased  due to a 
combination of the following factors : 
• the top box  was sealed closed and could not be opened for maintenance 
inspection  
• the insulation within the top box  was in poor condition  with significant  soot build -
up 
• the exhaust tail pipe had corroded to the extent that it  no longer  extend ed 
through and above the roof of the a uxiliary generator  wagon . 
What we can learn  
1.7 Rail vehicle maintenance must  include  inspection of all key parts and equipment  to 
minimise the risk of a fire on board a passenger train.  
1.8 Early fire detection systems on trains are vital to ensure any fire is detected at the 
earliest  opportunity before spreading throughout the train.  
 
1 The purpose of an auxiliary generator  wagon is to provide electrical power  for ancillary services on  passenger 
trains from a diesel -fuelled generator set.   An auxi liary generator wagon can also be referred to as a generator/ 
luggage van.  
2 The top box is the sealed box located above the generator set where soundproof material covers the exhaust 
silencer.

 2 Factual information  
Pārongo pono  
Background  
2.1 At the time of this incident , the Capital Connection express passenger train (the Capital 
Connection) was a long -distance passenger service that operated on weekdays 
between Palmerston North and Wellington. The service was operated by KiwiRail 
Holdings Limited (KiwiRail ) on behalf of the Greater Wellington Regional Council and 
the Horizons (Manawatu/Whanganui) Regional Council.  
2.2 Between 1971 and 1975, new wagons were imported from South Korea to be used as 
guards' wagons3. In 1998, Tranz  Rail4 modified six of these wagons and equipped each 
with an  auxiliary generator to provide electrical power for ancillary services, such as air 
conditioning and saloon lighting, on passenger trains.  
2.3 Five of these auxillary generator wagons (AG wagons)  remained  in operation at the 
time of this incident . Four were owned by KiwiRail, of which  two were leased to other 
operators (Glenbrook Rail and Dunedin Rail). The fifth AG wagon was owned by 
Greater Wellington Regional Council  and operated by Transdev  Wellington5.  
Narrative  
2.4 On Wednesday 11  May 2022 , the Capital Connection from Palmerston North to 
Wellington  had a consist6 of one locomotive attached to seven carriages (six S-class 
carriages7 and one serving carriage)  and an AG wagon  (AG130)  at the rear (see 
Figure  3).

 Final Report RO -2022 -101 2.6 At about 0500 , as part of their yard duties  to ready the train for service,  the train 
manager  entered AG130  at the Palmerston North station  to start the auxiliary 
generator set .  
2.7 With the auxiliary generator set  running, t he train manager  connected the power 
through to the rest of the train using the generator outgoing switch on the control 
panel.  
2.8 After the train manager  completed their yard duties , the diesel locomotive arrived and 
was coupled up to the train . This was followed by  a standard brake test before the train 
was piloted8 by the train manager  to the main platform at Palmerston North station.  
2.9 With the train berthed  at the platform, the train manager  released all external doors in 
preparation for passengers to board . 
2.10 At about 0602, the train manager  smelt something they described as a "burn off " 
(grass burning ). The train manager  walked to the back of the train to investigate the 
burning smell and realised it was coming from within AG130 . 
2.11 Upon entering AG130 , the train manager  noticed red embers in and around the  
exhaust silencer enclosure (the top box ) of the auxiliary generator set .  
2.12 The train manager  stopped the auxiliary generator set  by activating an emergency 
engine stop button located on the control panel , before  isolat ing the batteries  with the 
main control circuit breaker . 
2.13 The train manager  then contacted the locomotive engineer  to report the fire and ask 
the locomotive engineer  to alert train control.  
2.14 At about 0604 t he locomotive engineer  notified  the national t rain control centre9 of the 
situation at Palmerston North station and then asked  train control  for the traction 
overhead power to be switched off.  
2.15 The train manager  contacted Fire and Emergency  New Zealand  to report the fire  
onboard the train.  
2.16 The train manager  and the train attendant  evacuat ed all passengers and only after 
confirming that there were no passengers onboard, closed and locked the external 
doors to prevent re-entry.  
2.17 At about 0612  the firefighters  arrived and  entered AG130  and extinguished a small fire 
in the top box  area with a carbon dioxide portable fire extinguisher10. 
2.18 There were  no injuries to passengers or the train crew . Fire damage was confined  to 
the top box  and the ceiling of AG130 .  
2.19 KiwiRail arranged buses to replace the train service  and transport  waiting  passengers 
to Wellington . 
2.20 The attending fire officer advised the train crew to have AG130  monitored for at least a 
24-hour  period . They also  recommended that AG130 not be operated on the main line 
at speed during this period, because of  the risk of the fire re-igniting.

 2.21 The locomotive engineer  notified KiwiRail Operations regarding these fire risks.  A shunt 
team was dispatched with a shunt locomotive to uncouple AG130 and take it to the 
nearby Palmerston North rail yard.  
Key personnel  information  
2.22 The train manager  joined KiwiRail  as a train manager in 2015 and  had been  work ing 
onboard the Capital Connection  since then.  
2.23 The locomotive engineer  had more than 15 years'  experience driving trains .  
2.24 The train attendant  joined KiwiRail in 2021.   
2.25 The KiwiRail train crew were trained in basic firefighting, this training included the use 
of portable fire extinguishers . However , as the AG130 was full of smoke and the 
portable fire extinguishers available were designed to fight small fires, the train crew 
exercised their judgment and did not attempt to put out the fire themselves.  
Instructions to train crew in the event of a fire  
2.26 KiwiRail had produced guidelines for the event of a vehicle on fire.  Clause 3.2 of 
Section 4.1 (Motive Power Unit Inspection and Operating Instructions) of the KiwiRail 
Rail Operating Code11 states:  
When a vehicle on a train is on fire, the Locomotive Engineer must use judgement as to the 
best course to adopt in the circumstances, taking into consideration the proximity of 
firefighting appliances, the load in the vehicle, and the possibility of damage  to bridges, 
adjacent vehicles or property.  
2.27 Clause 3.3 of the Code - Fire Precautions - states:  
The best protection against fire is cleanliness.  This applies particularly to the engine and 
engine room, the underframe mounted equipment and bogies.  
2.28 At clause 10.1 - Fire, in Section: 11 (Emergency Procedures) of KiwiRail's Operating 
Procedures, it states in part:  
Immediate action on discovery:   
• raise the alarm  
• call fire - dial 111  
• attempt to extinguish the fire - use appropriate extinguisher.  
Vehicle  information  
Auxiliary generator wagon 130   
2.29 AG130 was owned , operated,  and maintained  by KiwiRail .  
2.30 The purpose of  AG130 was to provide electrical power for ancillary services on  the 
passenger section of the train from a 165 kVA12 diesel -fuelled turbo auxiliary generator 
set. AG130 also provide d storage for onboard services and a disabled access facility  (a 
wheelchair ramp ).

 Final Report RO -2022 -101 Fire detection and response   
2.31 There were  no fire or smoke alarms  in AG130 . 
2.32 AG130 contained a L ifeline 2000 automatic fire extinguisher system13 (Lifeline 2000)  
attached to the auxiliary generator set , which was not activated during the incident . 
2.33 The Lifeline 2000 was designed  to be activated  using an insulated, flexible double -link 
wire fitted within the auxiliary generator set  enclosure. Heat generated by a fire would 
melt the insulation around the link wire and allow the two conductors to make contact, 
triggering the control unit to activate an explosive charge on a pressurised fire 
extinguisher bottle. The foam suppressant was ducted to discharge nozzles within the 
auxiliary generator set  enclosure via plastic -coated aluminium tubing . 
2.34 Inspection after the fire found  that the insulation around the link wire had not melted 
and remained intact, unaffected by the incident , as would be expected given the 
location of the fire  (see paragraph 3.14).  
2.35 AG130 contained two portable 4.5  kilogram dry -powder fire extinguishers, one located 
in the luggage compartment,  and another located at the other end of the wagon  (see 
Figure  4). There was also one portable fire extinguisher in each passenger carriage  of 
the Capital Connection .  
2.36 None of the onboard fire extinguisher s was used to extinguish the fire.  
 
AG wagon  exhaust system  
2.37 The Commission  inspected the exhaust systems of three AG wagons : AG130 , AG176 
and AG222.  The AG130 and the AG176 were  owned by KiwiRail, while the AG 222 was 
occasionally leased by KiwiRail from Greater Wellington Regional Counci l.  The AG130 
exhaust system was the only one in which t he exhaust tail pipe was missing, so that the 
auxiliary generator set 's exhaus t did not extend up  through the top box  and out 
through the roof  (see Figure  5).

AG wagon inspection and maintenance  program me 
2.40 Before operating rail vehicles on the national rail network,  an operator must  provide a 
safety case to Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency  (in consultation with WorkSafe NZ) to 
approve . The operator 's rail vehicles must be compliant with the safety system  
described in that safety case before it can operate on the national rail network.  
2.41 The inspection and maintenance of AG wagon s was in accordance with KiwiRail's  
M2000 Mechanical Code14 (the Code). The Code  require d the scheduled maintenance 
inspection of locomotive -hauled passenger rolling stock  (which i nclud es AG wagon s) 
to be carried out by a service manager or team leader at the following intervals:  
 
14 Its purpose is to ensure that rail vehicles and associated equipment comply with the conditions of KiwiRail's Rail 
Licence and National Rail System Standards (NRSS) .

upper limit of 26000 km or 7 months whichever comes first.  
• The C  maintenance check every 12 months with an upper limit of 14 months.  
2.42 The 500 -hour check on auxiliary generator sets  required the following work to be 
carried out:  
• air filters   clean or change  
• engine oil change  
• oil filters    change  
• fuel lift pump  clean strainer and sediment bowl  
• fuel filters  change  
• water filter change  
• vee belts   check tension and condition  
• oil leaks   rectify  
• test run  check idle speed, check intake fans operate OK.  
2.43 On 19  April 2021,  a 500-hour check was completed on the  AG130  auxiliary generator 
set. The engine hour meter registered 43,967 operating hours . 
2.44 On 1 September  2021  (eight months before the incident) , a further  500-hour check  was 
carried out . The engine hour meter registered 44,837 operating hours , making this 
check overdue by 370 hours.  KiwiRail advised the Commission that the late scheduling 
of the check was because of  staffing pressures . 
2.45 During this check , it was noted that the oil pressure gauge was not working  and the re 
was an abnormal  alternator output frequency of 50 Hz. 
2.46 The most recent A, B and C checks on AG130 were undertaken within the specified 
timeframes  and did not identify any major work to be carried out to either the wheels, 
braking system, electrical components,  or the passenger car coupling system. There 
was no requirement to inspect the exhaust system or roof area  during any of the  
checks.  
Fire investigation  
2.47 The fire was confined  to the auxiliary generator set  enclosure16 of AG130 , affect ing the 
exhaust system and the ceiling of the wagon.  There was  smoke damage throughout 
AG130  (see Figure 8). 
 
15 The inspection and maintenance of  the power generator set every 500  operating hours was independent of the 
inspection and maintenance checks of the wagon itself.  
16 The generator set enclosure includes the engine, generator, fuel system and cooling and exhaust systems .

2.48 The diesel fuel for the auxiliary generator set  was contained within a tank under the 
auxiliary generator set  and had not been affected by the fire. Fuel pipes within the 
auxiliary generator set  enclosure remained intact . 
2.49 The independent  fire investigator  engaged by the Commission identified four potential 
causes of the fire:  
1. Due to damage to the exhaust 'tail pipe' and it not extending above the exterior roof 
line of the carriage, a spark or sparks from the exhaust entered the space between the 
exterior roof and the interior ceiling lining igniting the combustible material, plywood, 
below the outer skin of the wagon  
2. Due to damage to the exhaust 'tail pipe' and it not extending above the exterior roof 
line of the carriage, whilst parked the exhaust gases have built up in the space between 
the exterior roof and the interior ceiling lining raising the temperature of the lining and 
igniting the combustible plywood material, resulting in ignition  
3. Due to the proximity of the exhaust 'tail pipe' to the combustible lining, pyrophoric 
action17 has led to the ignition of the internal ceiling lining  
4. Due to the location of the exhaust 'tail pipe', radiant heat from the exhaust pipe has 
ignited the interior ceiling lining.  
2.50 The fire investigator determined that there were no electrical faults in the wiring and 
eliminated electricity as a possible cause of the fire.  
2.51 The fire investigator concluded that the most probable cause of the fire was accidental 
and, because of  the proximity of the exhaust tail pipe to the combustible lining, 
pyrophoric action had led to the ignition of the internal ceiling lining  (potential cause 3  
above).  
Previous occurrences  
2.52 Fires in AG wagons are not  uncommon because of  the presence of a wide range of fuel 
and ignition sources in the presence of running machiner y. 
 
17 Pyrophoric action is the spontaneous ignition of something on exposure to the air.

 3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event to identify 
those factors that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the 
severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues that have the potential to 
adversely affect future operations.  
How the fire occurred  
3.2 Commission i nvestigators inspected the exhaust systems of three different AG wagons, 
including the AG130 . Investigators found  that the AG130 exhaust  tail pipe no longer 
extended through the ceiling , and daylight was visible from inside the wagon  (see 
Figure  9). 
 
Figure 9: Daylight visible where exhaust tail pipe met ceiling of  AG130  
 
3.3 The degree of surface rusting and thinning of the exhaust tail pipe wall thickness 
indicate d it is very likely  that the  damage was age related . 
3.4 When the top box of AG130  was opened , investigators found the  insulati on material 
was in poor condition and contained a  significant  amount of soot. Although soot 
deposits in the top right of the top box may have been produced during the fire, it is 
almost certain  that those in the centre and lower left of the top box were formed 
before the fire.  
3.5 The independent fire investigator engaged by the Commission  determined that the fire 
in AG130 was accidental  (see Appendix 3: Fire Investigation Report ), They also 
determined  that the fire was likely  caused by  pyrophoric action  (arising from the 
proximity of the exhaust tail pipe to the combustible lining ) leading  to the ignition of 
the internal ceiling lining .  
3.6 In fire investigation terms, p yrophoric action  refers  to fires  that have started in 
confined spaces , where long-term exposure to a source of heat causes carbon deposits

 Final Report RO -2022 -101 such as c harcoal and soot to form.  A sudden influx of air, arising from  degradation of 
the surrounding area, c ould cause these carbon deposits to ignite .19 
3.7 It is virtually certain  that the  likelihood  of a fire on board AG 130 increased because of  
a combination of the following factors:  
• the insulation within the top box  was in poor condition, containing soot build -up 
• the exhaust tail pipe had corroded and did not extend through and above the roof 
of AG130  
• the top box  was sealed closed and could not be opened for maintenance or 
inspection.  
Inspection and maintenance  
Safety issue: The programmed  maintenance checks of the AG wagon were inadequate  and did 
not include  inspection of the exhaust system or of the roof.  This increased the risk of fire from 
exhaust systems in poor condition.  
3.8 KiwiRail's  M2000 Mechanical Code stipulates  the scheduled maintenance inspection  
intervals. The wagon schedule inspection systems are further detailed in the Wagon 
Inspection Manual M9202/01 . 
3.9 Because of staffing pressures , one of the 500 -hour checks  on AG130 was 370 hours 
overdue when it was carried out , but this had no bearing on the incident . 
3.10 As part of the scheduled maintenance t here was no requirement to inspect the top box 
or the roof of the wagon where the tail pipe should have extended through.  
3.11 It is virtually certain  that had the  main tenance pro gram me for AG130 included 
inspection of the auxiliary generator set  exhaust system  and the top box , the poor 
state of both the insulation  and the tail pipe  would have been identified.  
Onboard f ire detection system  
Safety issue: All wagons should contain detection systems capable of alert ing train crew and 
passengers to smoke or fire in any area within the wagon .  
3.12 The auxiliary generator set  within AG130 was fitted with a  Lifeline 2000  automatic fire 
extinguisher system . However, that system d id not include an audible alarm or other 
alert mechanism to warn the train crew or the passengers of a fire . Further, t here were 
no other fire or smoke alarms within AG130 . 
3.13 The Lifeline 2000 fire extinguisher system was configured to detect and extinguish a 
fire in or on the auxiliary generator set . A fire within the wagon , but away from the 
auxiliary generator set , would not activate the system until the heat of the fire was such 
that the  insulation around the link wire  melted . The fire in the ceiling of AG130 , around 
the exhaust tail pipe , had not yet reached the temperature required  to melt the link 
wire insulation and activate  the fire extinguisher system .  
3.14 Given the fire was detected by the train manager  smelling the smoke, it is  very likely  
that a smoke detector would have warn ed the train crew  of the fire at an earlier  stage .

 3.15 The AG wagon is the last vehicle in the consist when travelling south to Wellingt on 
from  Palmerston North.  Had this train service departed with the fire undetected, it is 
likely  that the fire would have remained  undetected  for some time . The Capital 
Connection travels  through seven tunnels , two of which are over  1.2 kilometres long. A 
train on fire is an extremely dangerou s situation, travelling through a tunnel would 
further exacerbate the serious ness of the  situation  as fire spreads more quickly in the 
confined space and evacuating  passengers and crew away from the danger is more 
difficult . 
3.16 In this incident, the fire was detected at a time when it was small enough for  a Fire and 
Emergency New  Zealand  crew  to attend and to extinguish it with a portable 
extinguisher. However, if the fire had  continued and grown  or occurred i n an isolated 
location, the risk of more exten sive damage to the train and danger to passengers and 
train crew  would be far greater.  
3.17 The loss of life and extent of property damage caused by a fire can be minimi sed by 
ensuring early  detection, thus allowing appropriate action to be taken.  
3.18 Although new passenger trains are designed and equipped with onboard fire detection 
systems, neither the "S" class carriages20 nor AG wagon had any fire detection systems 
installed.  
3.19 A recommendation  has been made to KiwiRail to address this safety issue ( see 
para 6.3). 
 
 
20 An "S" (Scenic)  class carriage is a corridor -type passenger carriage .

Ngā kiteng a 
4.1 It is virtually certain  that the likelihood of a fire on board AG130 increased because of  
a combination of the following factors:  
• the insulation within the top box  was in poor condition, containing soot build -up 
• the exhaust tail pipe had corroded and did not extend through and above the roof 
of AG130  
• the top box  was sealed closed and could not be opened for maintenance 
inspection.  
4.2 It is virtually certain  that had the  main tenance pro gram me for AG130 included 
inspection of the auxiliary generator set  exhaust system and the top box, the poor 
state of both the insulation and the tail pipe would have been identified.  
4.3 It is very likely  that a smoke detector would have warned the train crew of the fire at 
an earlier stage.  
4.4 The train crew took appropriate action on discovering the fire, evacuat ing the 
passengers and minimising the danger to passengers and crew.

 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.   
5.2 Safety i ssues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Maintenance checks  
Safety issue: The programmed  maintenance checks of the AG wagon were inadequate and did 
not include inspection of the exhaust system or of the roof.  This increased the risk of fire from 
exhaust systems in poor condition.  
5.3  In August  2022, KiwiRail informed the Commission that : 
The 12 monthly maintenance check for the Capital Connection fleet including AG vans was 
updated in August  2022 to include the following:  
➢ Check motor generator exhaust extends above the roof   
➢Check motor general exhaust rain flap is working  
➢ Open muffler compartment every year ending with 0 or 5 e.g. (2025 or 2030)  
➢ Inspect muffler, and exhaust pipe condition for damage, holes, corrosion, signs of 
exhaust leaks  
The 1250 km maintenance check for the fleet was updated in October  2022 to include:  
➢ Check exhaust system and muffler box for signs of exhaust leakage, i.e. signs of soot.  
➢ Check for fuel, water and oil leaks . 
5.4 The Commission considers  these safety actions have addressed the safety issue 
identified, and therefore no recommendation has been made.  
Wagon  fire detection  alarms  
Safety issue: All wagons should contain detection systems capable of alerting train crew and 
passengers to smoke or fire in any area within the wagon.  
 
5.5 On 28  September  2023, Kiwi Rail informed the Commission : 
The two AG vans (AG130 and AG176) have been replaced in service in July  2023 by 
SRG class generator/passenger carriages that are equipped with trainlined fire detection 
systems. The Kiwirail AG vans are currently on a stabling check regime pending probable 
disposal and are used only in exceptional circumstances.  
KiwiRail suggests that a more suitable recommendation could be for owners and rail 
operators (licence holders) of this class of wagon to ensure that any AG vans returned to 
or used in regular or permanent service to be first equipped with suitable smoke an d fire 
detection systems.  
 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report RO -2022 -101 5.6 The Commission acknowledges KiwiRail no longer regularly operate s either  AG130 or 
AG176 . However, while KiwiRail retain the AG wagons  for use, albeit in exceptional 
circumstances, the safety issue remains. Therefore, the Commission has made a 
recommendation  in Section 6 to address this issue.

 6 Recommendations  
Ngā tūtohutanga  
 
General   
6.1 The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people and  
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents . 
6.2 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendation s are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future.   
New recommendation   
6.3 On 25 October 2023, the Commission recommended that KiwiRail install smoke and 
fire detection systems in all auxiliary generator wagons  in service  to alert train crew  
and passengers  to a fire at the earliest opportunity . (039/23) 
6.4 On 13 November 2023 , KiwiRail  replied:  
This recommendation is accepted and implemented.  
KiwiRail no longer have any auxiliary generator wagons in service, since the two AG 
vans operating on Capital Connection have been replaced by SRG class carriages. 
All generator cars in use have fire mitigations in place that address the intent of this 
recommendation. If we do return any AG vans to service at any point in the future 
then we will make the necessary modifications to fire detection systems before 
doing so.

Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ng āti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai mārama' (i te ara 
haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pur suit of understanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe' or 'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent s the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā hau e wh ā - the four winds  
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 'long 
white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a  'Aviation '.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for ' Maritime .  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere ' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku  (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
