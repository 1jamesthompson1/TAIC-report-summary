to do so by FENZ, and the master was unable to confirm that all his crew were safely off 
the vessel. Emergencies that occur in port are problematic in that regard, because not all 
crew will necessarily be on board.  In this case only nine of the 44 crew members were on 
board to initially contain and fight the fire.  Several important procedures were not 
followed, of which some were  likely attributable to so few crew being available to 
respond.  
3.22. An important aspect of containing a fire is to deprive it of oxygen.  The s tandard 
procedure for achieving this is to close all doors and openings to the space where the 
fire is located.  After the retreat from the initial attempts to make a direct  attack on the 
fire, the cabin door was left open – so too was the door leading from the passageway to 
the open deck.  Also, the ventilation flaps supplying fresh air to the accommodation were 
left open.  
3.23. With a free flow of oxygen to the fire, it quickly s pread from the first engineer’s cabin to 
engulf the accommodation spaces within a matter of minutes.  
3.24. The master’s designated position in an emergency was on the bridge.  However, by the 
time he was alerted to the fire the bridge was rapidly becoming engulf ed in fire.  
Consequently the master was unable to use the communication equipment to summon 
help.  
3.25. The master went to the open deck aft15 of the bridge , where a number of crew had 
mustered and attempted to organise a full muster and form teams to fight the fire.  
However, several crew  members took their own course s of action, with some proceeding 
to the engine room to manage the ammonia risk and others re -entering the 
accommodation space to continue attacking the fire on an individual basis.  
3.26. This unco ordinat ed response to the fire continued until FENZ arrived and took command 
of the scene, having been called by a member of the public.  
3.27. Some crew members attempted to initiate firefighting by preparing fire hoses on the 
port and starboard side s of the upper deck .  However, they were unable to work the 
portable emergency fire pump to pressurise the fire hoses.  
3.28. In summary, the delay in all crew being alerted to the fire was a missed opportunity to 
extinguish it using portable firefighting equipment before it escala ted out of control.  
Then, because the immediate and surrounding areas were not shut down, the fire was

4.4.3.  KiwiRail investigated several options before choosing the Tranzlog event recorder system to 
provide an interlock capability  to prevent a similar incident .  The Tranzlog system was chosen 
to perform  this interlock b ecause the positions of the brake handles were  already being 
monitored by the system.  This option was successfully t ested during 2014/2015 and rolled 
out on all the DL-class  locomotives.  In view of this work, t he Commission has not made a

interlock and was underway at the time of the compilation of this report.  
Finding s 
1. The train departed Gl enbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating.  The 
brakes on all of the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver 
had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly when changing from one 
driving cab to the other.  
2. The driver was ab le to depart with a wrongly configured brake system because 
there was no mechanical interlock to prevent his doing so.  
3. The required pre -departure train brake test would have revealed that the train 
brake was not operational, but those involved omitted to p erform the test when a 
third locomotive was attached to the train.  
4. The train parted when a coupling that had not been fully secured allowed the 
hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train 
descended the gradient from Glenbrook . 
5. The derailment was caused by the rear portion of the train colliding with the 
forward portion seconds after the train parted.  
4.5. Non-technical skills  
Safety issue - When the three staff members came together to couple the third  locomotive to 
the disabled train at Glenbrook, no challenge and confirm action s were taken to complete a 
fundamental brake test procedure , which was designed to ensure  that the trains ' air brakes 
were functioning correctly.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 1.12.  The Commission made t hree  recommendations  to the Director of Civil Aviation to address the 
safety issues.  
1.13.  The key lessons  arising from this inquiry  are: 
● flying in mountainous terrain places additional demands on a pilot's skills and an 
aircraft's performance.  Both could be at or near the limits of their capabilities.  Operators 
need to ensure that their safety management systems address the additional risks 
associated with flying in such an environment  
● the use of 'standard' or 'assessed' passenger weights is not a licence to exceed an 
aircraft's permissible weight and balance parameters.  Any aircraft being operated 
outside the permissible range will have a higher risk of having an accident, particularly 
when being operated near the margins of aircraft performance capability  
● it is important for operators to keep comprehensive, formal records of all pilot training.  
Historical training records provide the basi s for ongoing performance monitoring  and 
professional development , particularly given natural attrition as safety and training 
managers move through the industry  
● seatbelts are only effective in preventing or minimising injury if they are fastened and 
prope rly adjusted.  Aircraft operators must ensure that passengers and crew fasten their 
seatbelts and adjust them to fit tightly across their hips  
● vortex ring state is a known hazard for helicopters.  To avoid the hazard, pilots must:  
a.  remain alert to the c onditions conducive to the formation of vortex ring state  
b.  closely monitor the airspeed and rate of descent during the final approach  
c.  initiate recovery action at the first indication that they may be approaching vortex 
ring state.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On the afternoon of Saturday 16 August 2014, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (the Commission)  of the accident.  The 
Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accid ent Investigation 
Commission Act 1990, and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 16 August 2014 the Commission notified the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) of 
France, which was the State of Manufacture for the helicopter and the engine.  In accorda nce 
with Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, France appointed a BEA 
investigator as its Accredited Representative to participate in the investigation.  
2.3. Three of the Commission's  investigators arrived in Queenstown on the afternoon o f 17 August 
2014 and conducted an initial survey of the accident site from a helicopter.  The investigators 
conducted a full site examination on 18 August 2014.  The wreckage was removed later that 
day and transported to the Commission's technical facility  in Wellington for further detailed 
examination.  
2.4. In the following three days, witnesses and first responders to the accident were interviewed.  
The maintenance records for the helicopter were obtained by the Commission and relevant 
engineering personnel we re interviewed.  The helicopter was not fitted with any equipment to 
record data, and no other source of recorded data was obtained from the accident flight.  
2.5. On 25 and 26 August 2014 the investigator in charge interviewed the surviving passengers.  
The inv estigation reviewed the CAA files concerning The Helicopter Line (the operator) and the 
pilot.  On 3 September 2014 the operator's general manager and chief pilot were interviewed.  
2.6. On 14 November 2014, at the request of the Commission, the helicopter manu facturer, Airbus 
Helicopters, completed an analysis of relevant helicopter performance data.  
2.7. On 28 January 2015, once the snow had melted, a team searched the accident site for any 
unrecovered items.  The search team recovered some items from the helicopte r. 
2.8. Between December 2014 and February 2015 , the Commission obtained additional 
information through BEA concerning the helicopter seats and seatbelts.  
2.9. On 19 October 2015 the engine was examined by Turbomeca at its maintenance facility in 
Sydney, Australia.   The Australian Transport Safety Bureau appointed an Accredited 
Representative to the Commission's inquiry to supervise the examination on behalf of the 
Commission.  On 29 October 2015 the Australian Transport Safety Bureau provided the 
Commission with a report on the engine examination.  
2.10.  On 27 January 2016 three investigators from BEA and a senior investigator from Airbus 
Helicopters travelled to New Zealand and examined the wreckage of the helicopter at the 
Commission's technical facility.  
2.11.  On 24 August 20 16 the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to interested 
persons for comment  and received submissions from four interested persons.   
2.12.  In response to the submissions received, the Commission undertook further independent 
enquiries , which included a review of all the primary evidence and information it had received 
from all sources.  The Commission also sought the opinion of an expert who had a long 
association with heli -skiing operations in Canada as a helicopter pilot, a regulator  and an 
independent accident investigator.  
2.13.  On 24 May 2017  the Commission approved the circulation of a revised draft report to 
interested persons affected by the changes .  Substantive submissions were received from 
three interested persons , including the o perator and the regulator  (CAA) .  The Commission 
requested further information concerning those submissions . 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 2.14.  On 23 August 2017  the Commission approved the circulation of a 2nd revised  draft report to 
interested persons for their  comment.   Further submissions were received and these were 
considered in the preparation of the final report.  
2.15.  On 25 October 2017, the Commission deferred publication of its final report due to 
prosecution proceedings the CAA and the operator were parties to, and w hich was proceeding 
to trial in November. The Commission wanted to ensure its report did not affect the fair 
administration of justice.  
2.16.  On 16 November 2017, the Commission approved publication of its final report following 
notification the prosecution pro ceedings were not proceeding to trial.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On the evening of Friday 15 August 2014, the pilot and the heli -skiing co -ordinator for the 
operator discussed the plan for the next day.  There were three skiing groups3 with whom the 
pilot would be flying the next day.  
3.1.2.  The heli -skiing was initially organised through an associated company (the heli -ski provider), 
which had taken the bookings and organised guides for each group.4  Five of the operator's 
helicopters were to  be used to support heli -skiing groups during the day, mainly in the 
mountains between Mount Aspiring National Park and Lake Wanaka.  
16 August 2014  
3.1.3.  At 0754 on Saturday 16 August 2014, the pilot took off from Queenstown in an AS350 -B2 
helicopter and took a group of passengers to the Cardrona snow park. He then continued to 
Wanaka where he delivered the helicopter to the maintenance provider.  The pilot then picked 
up another AS350 -B2 helicopter, the one involved in the accident (the helicopter).  The 
operato r had recently imported the helicopter from the United States, and this was to be its 
first commercial flight in New Zealand.  
3.1.4.  The pilot met with the engineer who had supervised the maintenance check and fitting of 
equipment to the helicopter.  Together the y transferred the ski basket  and other equipment, 
checked the documentation and conducted a visual inspection of the helicopter.  The pilot 
then flew the helicopter back to Queenstown to meet up with the ski groups.  
3.1.5.  At 1002 the pilot landed back at Queenst own and the three groups were  given their helicopter 
safety briefing in preparation for the day's activities.  A heli -ski guide loaded  the first group of 
five, group A, and their gear onto the h

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. The Liberian -registered container ship Rena  had left the New Zealand port of Napier at 1020 
on 4 October 2011 and was bound for the New Zealand port of Tauranga.  The master had 
given an estimated time of arrival at the Tauranga pilot station of 0300 the next day. The 
master calculated the estimated time of arrival by dividing the distance to go by the Rena 's 
normal service speed.  The calculation did not account for the unfavourable  currents that 
normally prevail ed down that stretch of coastline.  
1.2. After departure from Napier the master  learned  from notes on the chart of the unfavourable  
currents.  He then authorised the watchkeepers to deviate from the planned course lines on 
the chart to shorten the distance , and to search for the least unfavourable curr ents.  
1.3. The Rena 's second mate took over the watch shortly after midnight on 4 October.  He 
calculated that the Rena  would arrive at the port of Tauranga pilot station at 0300  at the 
ship's  then current speed.  Times for ships entering and leaving Tauranga H arbour are limited 
by the depth of water and the strength of the tidal currents  in the entrance channel .  Tauranga 
Harbour Control informed the second  mate that the latest time the Rena  could take the 
harbour pilot on board was 0300 .   
1.4. The planned course t o the Tauranga pilot station was to pass two nautical miles north of 
Astrolabe Reef before making the final adjustment in course to the pilot station.   The second  
mate decided to reduce the two miles to one mile in order to save time.  The second  mate 
then made a series of small course adjustments towards Astrolabe Reef to make the shortcut . 
In doing so he altered the course 5 degrees past the required track and did not make an 
allowance for any compass error or sideways "drift", and as a conseque nce the Rena  was 
making a ground track directly for Astrolabe Reef.  Meanwhile the master had been woken 
and arrived on the bridge to prepare for arrival at the port.  
1.5. The master and second  mate discussed preparations for arrival at the pilot station.  The 
master then assumed control of the ship , having received virtually no information on where 
the ship was , where it was heading , and what immediate dangers to navigation he needed to 
consider.

            == """4.3. Passage planning  
Safety issue: The vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of  a 
common passage plan before the pilotage began.  Consequently,  the pilot and the vessel 's 
bridge team had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed and their 
respective roles in monitoring against the plan.  
Safety issue : The IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to, 
but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that port authorities  create 
and use to meet those same standards . 
4.3.1.  When a pilot joins a vessel prior to the pilotage it is the first opportunity for the master and 
bridge team to : talk to the pilot; clarify any issues that may have been identified during the 
preparation of the passage plan; and ensure they are satisfied with the planned transit.  At 
this stage the pilot needs to be fully integrated into the bridge organisation so that the whole 
team works as a cohesive body and has a shared understanding  of the p assage plan . 
4.3.2.  Before any pilotage act begins, it is essential that the pilot and the master (including other 
members of the team) have a shared understanding of  the passage plan.  That did not happen 
in this case.  As often happens, the pilot intended  to na vigate to the standard port company 
passage plan , and the vessel  had its own passage plan, which  differed  from that of the port 
company . 
4.3.3.  An essential part of integrating the pilot into the bridge team is the pilot and master exchange 
of information, a briefing that should include all members of the bridge team.  The briefing is a 
bilateral exchange of important information where everyone is made aware of : any changes to 
the proposed plan ; the handling characteristics of the vessel ; and any notable 'dyna mic' 
information such as weather and tides  for the transit.   
4.3.4.  The port passage plan was available over the internet from the Port Otago  website .  The 
channel is narrow and there is little scope for deviating from the plan without leaving the 
navigational c hannel.  The preferred courses were presented as  smooth , curved lines without 
any marked waypoints, turn radii or off -track limits.  Without that information the vessel 's crew 
would not have been  able to replicate it in their own navigation systems, such a s the ECDIS .  
The vessel  was required to plan the passage in accordance with the IMO convention standards 
and guidelines16 (see Appendix 3) , but there was no international or New Zealand requirement 
for the port companies and their pilots to follow the same  standards when developing their 
own generic passage plans.  The Port Otago passage plan as presented on its website would 
not meet the IMO  standards  or other reputable guidelines available to mariners on voyage 
planning17.   
4.3.5.  When the pilot joined the Molly  Manx  he and the master discussed the vessel's characteristics 
and went through the Otago Harbour passage  plan.  
4.3.6.  However, the vessel  had its own passage plan loaded into the ECDIS, which differed from that 
of Port Otago.  Because the vessel 's plan was the p lan loaded into the ECDIS, that is what the 
bridge team , excluding the pilot, was using to monitor the vessel's progress.  Me anwhile , the 
pilot was navigating the vessel  to the Port Otago  passage plan, using visual reference s as he 
had been  trained to do .  The bridge team, which now included the pilot, was not aligned in its 
thinking and did not share the same understanding  of the plan.  This dynamic was going to 
make effective BRM  difficult to achieve, which is discussed in the following section.  
4.3.7.  The New  Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code  is a voluntary national standard .  The 
Code recommends that , "Up-to-date passage plans and guidance should be published, and be 
available to harbour users and the masters of visiting vessel s" (see Appendix 6).  
                                                        
16 Chapt er V, Safety of Navigation, of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 
and Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning.  
17 Other best -practice guidelines also contain valuable advice on bridge watchkeeping in general and voyage 
planning in particular. They include: the United Kingdom's Maritime and Coastguard Agency's guidance on 
Chapter V, Safety of Navigation, of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ; the 
Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - A practical guide; and the International Chamber of 
Shipping's Bridge Procedures Guide.  

<< Page 15 >>
 
Final Report MO -2016 -204 | Page 15 4.3.8.  One method of ensuring that an approved passage plan is available on board would be for 
port companies or harbour authorities to make available to vessel s properly constructed and 
validated passage plan s that meet the  port-specific standards  and guidelines included in  
Chapter V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of 
Life at Sea  (SOLAS) , and Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning .  Such a system 
would assist in on-board passage planning and allow a v essel to be better prepared when the 
pilot boards .  This action would greatly assist the smooth transition of the pilot into the bridge 
team at a time of typically high workload and little time before the pilotage begins.  
4.3.9.  More vessel s are using ECDIS s as the primary means of navigation , and  this will increase in 
the future.  As it was  on board the Molly Manx , the passage plan to the berth is usually loaded 
into the vessel 's ECDIS.  Ideally, passage plans generated by port companies should be to the 
same IMO standard s that vessel s are required to meet , and should be compatible for use in 
an ECDIS.   
4.3.10.  Many vessel s transit more than one New Zealand port.  It would greatly enhance safety if the 
passage plans were, as far as practicable, in a standard format an d could be found at one 
site.  Vessel s routed to several New Zealand ports would be able to access from one place 
standardised passage plans for several ports, even before they depart ed from their previous 
overseas port s. 
4.3.11.  Currently there can be issues with uploading standardised passage plans into an ECDIS, 
because ECDIS manufacturers have proprietary systems that require specific formats.  
However,  that will shortly change.   The International Hydrographic Organization  and the 
International Electrotechnical  Commission standard for ECDIS s (IEC 61774 Edition 4, 
September 2015) from August 2017 includes a route exchange format that will make  it easier 
for data transfers.  In the future it will be possible to send passage plans to all vessels in the 
correct form at to be uploaded direct ly into the ECDIS system , thereby reducing the possibility 
of navigating officers making errors when loading them  into ECDIS s.  However, this facility was 
not available at the time of the accident and therefore was not able to be us ed by  the bridge 
team on this occasion.    
4.3.12.  The Commission has made recommendations to Maritime New Zealand to promote the use of 
standard passage plans by all New Zealand harbour authorities."""

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Pressure vessels are widely used on  board ships for various applications .  Their  failure can be 
catastrophic and may result  in human injury and death , as was the case on board  the Emerald 
Princess .  
4.1.2.  The crew were follow ing the correct procedure for recharging the nitrogen cylinders when the 
cylinder burst.  The failed cylinder was one of four located at lifeboat station No.  24 and had 
very little to no protection from sea spray.  The cylinder was severely weakened by corrosion , 
which caused it to fail under normal working loads .  The shipboard maintenance plan and the 
various inspection regimes that gave effect to that plan did not detect or remedy the issue 
before the failure occurred.  T he cylinder that failed was  overdue for maintenance  and testing,  
and should not have been in service at the time of the accident.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses why the nitrogen cylinder  remain ed in service despite being in 
a danger ous condition .  The analysis raise s the following two safety issues : 
 there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection 
of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored e nergy systems on lifeboat launching 
installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some case inadequate, 
standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised 
service providers  
 technicians who are author ised to conduct mandatory annual and five -yearly inspections 
of lifeboat -launching installations are not required to have specific training and 
certification for inspecting any stored energy -release systems and their associated 
pressure cylinders.  
4.2. Why did the cylinder burst?  
4.2.1.  The cylinder burst because a region of severe corrosion reduced the cylinder wall thickness 
from about 4.81  mm to 1.45  mm and significantly compromised the cylinder's ability to 
withstand internal pressure.  As a result, the cylinder su ffered an overpressure burst while the 
crew attempted to raise the nitrogen pressure from 160 bar to its normal working pressure of 
200 bar.  
4.2.2.  There is no clear evidence as to why this particular cylinder was so heavily corroded in the 
area where the failure  started.  The adjacent cylinders in the frame were not heavily corroded. 
Corrosion can be initiated by a number of factors.  Mechanical damage to the protective 
coating in a saltwater environment is a common cause.  Seawater being trapped against a 
steel surface can accelerate corrosion.  The straps that retained the bottles in the frame is a

4.3. On-board maintenance and inspection of pressure vessels  
Maintenance   
4.3.1.  The maintenance schedule for nitrogen cylinders and accumulators  was calendar based .  That 
is, time was the trigger for the various inspections and test s.  Weekly and monthly routines 
were carried out by the crew , while major maintenance work such as h ydrostatic pressure 
testing of nitrogen cylinders  was designated to an authorised service provider  or sh ore-based 
testing facility . 
4.3.2.  Hydrostatic pressure testing is a standard method of pressure testing cylinders.  It involves 
filling a cylinder with water and pressuris ing it up to 1.5 times its design pressure limit.  The 
pressure is then held for a prescribed amount of time and the cylinder is  then  inspected for 
leaks.  
4.3.3.  The maintenance regime on board the Emerald Princess  was kept in a  computer -based 
maintenance  system.  
4.3.4.  The hydrostatic pressure testing of nitrogen cyli nders was scheduled to have been carried out 
every 10 years , starting from the date they were  first h ydrostatically pressure tested. H owever, 
the start date entered into the maintenance plan was May 2007,  which was  the date that the 
nitrogen cylinders were installed on the vessel during b uild.  However, the  cylinder that failed  
had been  manufactured in September 2005, which was when it was first pressure tested.  
Therefore , it was overdue for testing by one  year and five  months at the time of the accident.  
The operator has now addressed this issue and updated its maintenance plan so that it tracks 
the age of each cylinder based on  its manufacture date , rather than its installation date .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Pressure vessels are widely used on  board ships for various applications .  Their  failure can be 
catastrophic and may result  in human injury and death , as was the case on board  the Emerald 
Princess .  
4.1.2.  The crew were follow ing the correct procedure for recharging the nitrogen cylinders when the 
cylinder burst.  The failed cylinder was one of four located at lifeboat station No.  24 and had 
very little to no protection from sea spray.  The cylinder was severely weakened by corrosion , 
which caused it to fail under normal working loads .  The shipboard maintenance plan and the 
various inspection regimes that gave effect to that plan did not detect or remedy the issue 
before the failure occurred.  T he cylinder that failed was  overdue for maintenance  and testing,  
and should not have been in service at the time of the accident.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses why the nitrogen cylinder  remain ed in service despite being in 
a danger ous condition .  The analysis raise s the following two safety issues : 
 there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection 
of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored e nergy systems on lifeboat launching 
installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some case inadequate, 
standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised 
service providers

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 9 February 2017, the crew of the Bermuda -flagged passenger ship Emerald Princess  were 
conducting maintenance on one of the lifeboat launching systems while the ship was berthed 
at Port Chalmers, Dunedin.  
1.2. The maintenance was completed and the crew were restoring pressure to a b ank of high -
pressure nitrogen -gas cylinders that formed part of the launching davit 'stored energy' system . 
One of the nitrogen bottles burst, fatally injuring a crew member who was standing close by.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commis sion) found  that the nitrogen 
cylinder  burst at below its normal working pressure because severe external corrosion had 
reduced the wall thickness to about 30% of its original thickness.  
1.4. The failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders within the stored energy 
system, despite having been surveyed about two weeks earlier , were not fit for purpose and 
should not have been left in service.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that there  is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards 
to be developed at a global level for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, 
replacing high -pressure cylinders associated with stored energy systems on board ships.  
1.6. The operator took a number of immediate safety actions  to prevent  a recurrence of the 
accident  on any of its ships . 
1.7. The Commission issued an interim report with early  recommendations  to the equipment 
manufacturer , the International Soci ety of Classification Societies , the Cru ise Lines 
International Association and Maritime New Zealand to alert their members and surveyors as 
appropriate to the circumstances of the accident and to have the condition of similar 
installations checked.  
1.8. The Commission made two additional recommendat ions: one for the manufacturer to improve 
training for its surveyors; and one for Maritime New Zealand to raise , through the appropriate 
International Maritime Organi zation safety committee for its consideration, the implications for 
maritime safety of not  having adequate minimum standards for the inspection , testing and 
rejection of pressure vessels that are part of stored energy system s. 
1.9. A key lesson  arising from this inquiry is:  
 any sign of corrosion on high -pressure cylinders should be fully investigated by a person 
competent in examining high -pressure cylinders before any remedial work is undertaken 
and the cylinder s are  allowed back into service .
