  abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called confabulation or delusion) is a confident response by an AI that does not seem to be justified by its training data. For example, a hallucinating chatbot might, when asked to generate a financial report for a company, falsely state that the company's revenue was \$13.6 billion (or some other number apparently "plucked from thin air").Such phenomena are termed "hallucinations", in loose analogy with the phenomenon of hallucination in human psychology. However, one key difference is that human hallucination is usually associated with false percepts, but an AI hallucination is associated with the category of unjustified responses or beliefs. Some researchers believe the specific term "AI hallucination" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.AI hallucination gained prominence around 2022 alongside the rollout of certain large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Users complained that such bots often seemed to pointlessly embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within their generated content. By 2023, analysts considered frequent hallucination to be a major problem in LLM technology.},

It will replace \#3 Right now I can only think of a complete run through that will identify the the themes then the next run-through will give weightings. Proposed solution There can be defined limits like minimum number of themes and maximum number of themes. Then the model can go through each report one by one. At each report it say "what are the themes in this report?" with the new summary and the previous culmination of themes it will combine them together. This means that it will slowly develop a list of themes that are more and more rigours. Problems The order of reading reports to generate the themes could have a large effect on the outcome of themes The outcome might have too much variance as it wont take into account the weight of all previous reports when trying to add two theme lists together. Alternate solution Summarise each report with min-max number of themes. THen goes through all the themes and summarise them into just a set number.}

  abstract = {A taxicab geometry or a Manhattan geometry is a geometry whose usual distance function or metric of Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. The taxicab metric is also known as rectilinear distance, L1 distance, L1 distance or                                    ℓ                        1                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash ell \_\{1\}\}    norm (see Lp space), snake distance, city block distance, Manhattan distance or Manhattan length. The latter names refer to the rectilinear street layout on the island of Manhattan, where the shortest path a taxi travels between two points is the sum of the absolute values of distances that it travels on avenues and on streets. The geometry has been used in regression analysis since the 18th century, and is often referred to as LASSO. The geometric interpretation dates to non-Euclidean geometry of the 19th century and is due to Hermann Minkowski.
