        Extracted Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. The standard roster that the train controller was working in the weeks leading 
up to the incident did not offer the train controller sufficient opportunity to recover from any 
sleep debt incurred after a shif t cycle.  

2. The train controller had been involved in three ope rating irregularities during 
the previous 16 months and KiwiRail had identified his having concentration and focus issues.  
Despite this KiwiRail had allowed him to continue in the train controller role .

        Inferred Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. The KiwiRail train control roster did not allow sufficient opportunity for the 
train controller to recover from any sleep debt he may have incurred during any 
cycle of shifts.  

2. The train controller's cognitive performance was highly likely impaired by 
fatigue at the time he  authorised the vehicles to cross the bridge in the path 
of the oncoming train . 

3. The train controller was performing a safety -critical role  even after KiwiRail 
had identified performance issues similar to those that highly likely 
contributed to his authorising the work vehicles to occupy the section of track 
ahead of the train.

1.   There w as no defence in the system to prevent an accident if a train driver 
did not react correctly to signals and route indicators.  

2.  KiwiRail's  current policy and procedures regarding information that train 
controllers should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other 
factors that are likely to affect the trains' progress are unclear and not consistent with 
protocols fo r good communication and crew resource management .

an accident occurring if a train driver did not react correctly to the trackside

1.  
 the vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a 
common passage plan before the pilotage began.  Consequently the pilot and the 
vessel 's bridge team had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed 
and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan  
 the IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to , but 
there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and 
use to meet those same standards  
 the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO 
and company standards when the grounding occurred  
 the standard of  BRM  on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago pilotage did not meet 
good industry practice .

1. The vessel's ECDIS was not correctly configured for navigation in a narrow 
channel, which meant the crew were not adequately monitoring the progress of 
the vessel  in support of the pilot, who was mainly navigating by visual 
references.  

2. The standard of bridge resource management on the Molly Manx  bridge leading 
up to the grounding did not meet industry good practice.

        Extracted Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. The captain and first officer did not adhere to company standard operating 
procedures for a "monitored approach " to the runway in poor meteorological conditions, 
which eroded safety margins built in  to the procedure s and compromised the safety of the 
flight.  

2. The operator was aware of the captain 's tendency over a period of at least 
three years to not always follow standard communication procedures.  The informal method 
the company used to address the issue did not result in any measurable improvement.

        Inferred Safety Issues:

1. The operator had not follow ed its own procedures for managing the previously 
identified performance issues with the captain.   This resulted in his continu ing 
with non-conforming practices, virtually unchallenged .

1. The Robinson helicopter flight manual s do not conform to the aviation industry 
practice for the use of "Warnings " to emphasise flight conditions and operating practices that 
can cause death or serious injury .

        Inferred Safety Issues:

1. The importance of some critical safety information in Robinson flight manuals 
was likely to have been diminished by Robinson's use of "Caution ", rather than 
"Warning ", for operating conditions and practices that involve a risk of personal 
injury or loss of life .

        Extracted Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. The TMP did not fully identify the risk s to road and rail vehicles approaching the 
crossing . 

2. Work within the rail corridor  was undertaken without  a permit to do so being 
obtained.  As a result , potential risk -mitigation actions that were required prior to the issue of 
the permit were not completed. Not  obtaining a permit increased  the risk to road and rail users  
approaching  the crossing .  


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        Inferred Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. The TMP approved by the contractor under delegated authority from Waka Kotahi 
did not identify the rail corridor and crossing within the work area . This was 
contrary to the advice in Waka Kotahi's own publication , Traffic  Control Devices 
Manual  Part 9 (NZ Transport Agency, 20 12), which stated in part:  
Whenever both rail and road corridors are within a work site, any traffic 
management plan must consider implications of the work and associated controls 
on the safe operation of each corridor . 
It is essential that critical features such as railway lines and traffic control 
devices (such as flashing light assemblies) are included on plans. This will 
ensure those involved in the design and approval of the plans fully consider the 
implications of the work on all traffic (including road and rail vehicles) through 
the site as required by CoPTTM  [the Code of Practice for Temporary Traffic 
Management ]4. 

2. The activity conducted around the level crossing had not been issued with a 
permit by KiwiRail.

1. The sighting distance available to drivers of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea 
Road  level crossing safely did not comply with the N Z Transport Agency's Traffic Control 
Devices Manual . 

2. level crossing assessments do  not require the  road  profile and the alignment of 
roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured .  Therefore 
there are no check s made to ensure that all road -legal vehicles can pass over level crossing s 
without becoming stuck .

1.  The train controller made an assumption about the location of the passenger 
train and did not confirm this location before authorising the person -in-charge's track 
occupation.  Assumptio ns made by train controllers about the location s of trains and other rail 
vehicles are a real and constant risk  that must be continu ally and properly managed.  

2.  The passenger train was not electronically visible to the train controller when he 
authorised the person -in-charge's track occupation.  A significant portion of the controlled rail 
network, and therefore a large number  of rail movements and track activitie s, is not 
electronically visible to train control at any given time.  

3.  The train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before the 
incident.  Train controllers who do not eat properly and regularly during their shift s and/or 
who do not take rest breaks during their shift s may become mentally fatigued.  In these 
circumstances, train controllers are more likely to make mistakes .  


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        Inferred Safety Issues:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1. Train controllers must ensure that they eat properly and regularly during 
shifts.  This cannot be treated casually or with indifference , when they are 
performing such a safety -critical  role.   

2. KiwiRail's approach to train control, where its train controllers work 8 -hour 
shift s without scheduled breaks, is not safe unless processes are in place to 
manage and mitigate the risks of fatigue and stress  effectively .  

3. KiwiRail must ensure that train controllers treat diet and nutrition seriously, 
that food is easily accessible by train controllers during their shifts and that 
train controllers are given breaks to rest and have adequate nutrition.   

4. The passenger train driver could have heard the train controller authorising 
a track occupation directly in the path of his train and intervened to prevent 
the conflict, but he lost that opportunity because he routinely turned down 
the volume on his train radio and only actively listened for radio traffic in 
which  his train number was mentioned.
