Exact safety issue extraction is not too much of a worry and just needs to be tested and could be done so with unit tests.\n",

    "All the reports that have the safety issues explicitly mentioned will show me what the correct answer is. So all I need to do is remove the explicitly mention of the safety issue from the report then I can run it as an inferred and see if it comes up with the same safety issue."
