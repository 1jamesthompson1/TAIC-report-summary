          "Safety issue: The standard of bridge resource management on the Monte Stello leading up to the grounding was not as high as that found operating on the other three vessels operated under KiwiRail's safety management system.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 010/16: On 25 February 2016 the Commission recommended that the chief executive of KiwiRail ensure that the bridge resource management policy and procedures outlined in its safety management system remain relevant and effective for all crews on all ships in the fleet, all of the time.",
          "Safety issue: the operator's planned maintenance programme did not ensure that the manufacturers' specifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 010/19: On 12 December 2019 the Commission recommended to the Director of Maritime New Zealand that they ensure all operators working under Maritime Rules Part 82 have identified on each jet boat all systems that are critical to the safe operation of the boat, and to have a documented inspection and maintenance system in place that covers those critical systems and also ensures they meet manufacturersâ€™ specifications. The inspection and maintenance system should complement rather than replace any existing system of daily checks.",
          "Safety issue: Napier pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the Napier Pilotage Area and that the outward pilotage limit was not legal.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 007/14: the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Hawke's Bay Regional Council that the harbourmaster ensure that the Maritime Rules and Bylaws for piloting vessels within the Napier Pilotage Area are followed. Further, that the markings on and content in nautical publications such as, but not limited to, charts, Admiralty Sailing Directions and Admiralty Lists of Radio Signals are accurate in describing the areas and procedures for pilotage within Hawke's Bay Regional Council's areas of responsibility.",
          "Safety issue: The train controller had been involved in three operating irregularities during the previous 16 months and KiwiRail had identified his having concentration and focus issues. Despite this KiwiRail had allowed him to continue in the train controller role.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 023/14: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that he address with KiwiRail the safety issue whereby KiwiRail's standard policy and procedures allowed an \"at-risk\" train controller to continue working at train control workstations while undergoing a formal investigation and remedial process after KiwiRail had identified issues that would have affected his ability to perform his safety-critical role effectively.",
          "Safety issue: Most of the passenger trains in the Wellington commuter fleet are not equipped with selcall-capable radio equipment, which means that in the event of an emergency brake application or other event that causes a rapid reduction in air brake pipe pressure, there could be a critical delay in train control being alerted in time to prevent the event escalating.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 021/12: KiwiRailâ€™s predecessors determined that the Wellington rail electric multiple unit commuter service was not a single-person operation.  Irrespective of whether these trains were a \"single-person\" or a \"two-person\" operation, as a consequence, the radio system fitted to these trains did not have selcall capability and could not send an alert to train control automatically when there was a rapid drop in brake pipe pressure such as when the driver makes an emergency brake application.  Any delay in train control being alerted to an accident or incident within the double-tracked commuter network is a safety issue.  The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of NZ Transport Agency that he address this safety issue.",

          "Safety issue: With the nose landing gear stuck in a partially extended position, light from the taxi light was likely detected by the sensor for the down-lock verification system, causing it to give a false green light.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 027/12: \"On date the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge Transport Canada to:\n- note the instances of false verification of landing gear position reported for the Q300 and some related aeroplanes and the potential for a false indication to cause an accident, and\n- require Bombardier Aerospace to take action to improve the reliability and dependability of the down-lock verification system\"",
          "Safety issue: The internal audit's recommendations to improve safety had been signed off as completed by the master, but the accident demonstrated that not much had actually changed, indicating a poorly developed safety culture on board.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The flight crew's reliance on open-descent mode without adequately monitoring and ensuring compliance with intermediate altitude restrictions led to the aircraft descending below the minimum permitted altitude.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The damage to the seals within the extend/retract hydraulic actuator could have initially been caused by a manufacturing defect in the seals or by an incorrect assembly technique. The damage may have been exacerbated by debris in the hydraulic fluid that originated from excessive wear in another actuator in the system, the one that opened and closed the forward nose landing gear doors.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 028/12: On date the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he monitor the progress of the investigations by Air Nelson and Bombardier Aerospace into the causes of excessive wear in Q300 nose landing gear door actuators (part number 2011-4504) and liaise with Transport Canada in order to produce acceptable corrective actions",
          "Safety issue: The Ganz trains were generally strong and well-built and had met the crashworthiness standards at the time of build some 30 years earlier, but they did not perform as well as a modern train during a similar front-end collision, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the drivers and possibly passengers seated near the ends of the trains.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 022/12: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency monitor the development of current prototype improvements in crashworthiness for the Ganz Mavag rail fleet and requires that such improvements be adopted for any trains that are to remain in service for an appreciable time.",
          "Safety issue: It could not be established why the chief officer, a veteran of the sea, and senior officer on board would have ignored the warnings given by the bosun and entered the cargo hold, particularly as number 5 cargo hold was not one of those identified by the fumigator as needing water removed.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The in-flight break-up was very unlikely to have been caused by low main rotor RPM (revolutions per minute).\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: differences between the intensity settings used on the night of this incident for runway and taxiway lights and the ICAO-recommended settings for similar conditions\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 019/15: On 1 February 2016 the Commission recommended that the chief executive of Auckland International Airport Limited, in conjunction with the chief executive of Airways, measure and recalibrate luminous intensity settings for the taxiway centreline lights, runway centreline and\nrunway edge lights and reconfigure the associated control tower setting selections so that controllers may select the respective light intensities recommended by ICAO for various levels of ambient lighting.\nRecommendation 020/15: On 25 February 2016 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation, in conjunction with the chief executive of Airways, check that aerodrome runway lighting systems at all certificated aerodromes comply with Part 139.",
          "Safety issue: The lack of a requirement for flight crews to actively use onboard systems, such as the navigation display, to monitor the aircraft's compliance with altitude restrictions during descent in open-descent mode, potentially compromises situational awareness and flight safety.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Foreign objects left inside an aircraft and around safety-critical components such as flight control systems are a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Loose articles can move inside an aircraft and become trapped under moving components, such as control cables and levers, disrupting the normal operation of aircraft systems and damaging system components.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: There were 24 passengers on board the Torea when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Human memory can be influenced by a number of factors, including high workload, late running, distraction, and environmental conditions. Therefore, it becomes important that controls are put in place to reduce the risk of human error.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 025/17: On 24 August 2017, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review its post-incident drug and alcohol policy to ensure that all personnel directly involved in an accident and/or operating incident are asked to submit to testing.",

          "Safety issue: The design of the closures on the ventilation grilles around the fish processing deck.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Level crossing assessments do not require the road profile and the alignment of roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured. Therefore, there are no checks made to ensure that all road-legal vehicles can pass over level crossings without becoming stuck.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 013/16: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and all road controlling authorities to ensure that rail level crossing assessments include a measure of the road profile and compatibility with the allowable dimensions for long and low road vehicles.\nRecommendation 012/16: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and Waikato District Council to address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding on the approaches to Wellington Station, such as: providing better recognition of signals; standard procedures for signalling trains through the area; and better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 034/17: the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer-term solution can be made.",
          "Safety issue: The false green light on the verification system misled the pilots of ZK-NEB into believing that the nose landing gear was fully down and locked.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 027/12: \"On date the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge Transport Canada to:\n- note the instances of false verification of landing gear position reported for the Q300 and some related aeroplanes and the potential for a false indication to cause an accident, and\n- require Bombardier Aerospace to take action to improve the reliability and dependability of the down-lock verification system\"",
          "Safety issue: The miscommunication between the driver and the train controller arose from a casual and ambiguous conversation at a time when a set of clear and precise instructions should have been issued.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The guidelines for internal inspection of control valves every five years may not be sufficient to detect early deterioration, suggesting that more frequent operational pressure tests could be necessary to ensure system integrity.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 019/11: Critical components in a fixed CO2 gas fire fighting system such as control valves can cause serious harm or immobilise a vessel if they fail. It is a concern that such components are only required to be internally examined every 5 years and are not required to be tested at the design operating pressure at all.\nIt is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forward this report to the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Classification Societies so that they can draw on the lessons learned from this incident and consider amending the current guidelines to require a more robust examination and testing regime for such critical components. (019/11)",

          "Safety issue: The verification system for checking if the landing gear is down and locked on the Dash 8 series of aircraft is not reliable enough for pilots to place total trust in it when trying to establish the status of the landing gear.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 027/12: \"On date the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge Transport Canada to:\n- note the instances of false verification of landing gear position reported for the Q300 and some related aeroplanes and the potential for a false indication to cause an accident, and\n- require Bombardier Aerospace to take action to improve the reliability and dependability of the down-lock verification system\"",
          "Safety issue: The similarity of text in adjacent steps of the QRH and the lack of numbered steps contributed to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non-normal procedures. However, these errors did not contribute to the accident.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 037/12: On 14 December 2012 the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge operators to adopt QRH checklist formats that reduce the possibility of misreading or omitting a procedural step",
          "Safety issue: Mobile phone use has proven to be a major distractor in other rail, air and marine accidents that the Commission has investigated. The danger has also been recognised and dealt with by recent changes in road legislation preventing the use of mobile phones while driving road vehicles.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: There was a potential for drivers of metro passenger trains to be distracted by non-operational interactions with other train staff.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 023/13: the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail takes the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversation with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule.",
          "Safety issue: There are no formal risk controls in New Zealand for helicopter NVIS or air ambulance operations unlike other jurisdictions that have set minimum standards in response to the high accident rate in this sector.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 021/22: The Commission recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand address the growing gap between New Zealandâ€™s minimum performance requirements and technical standards for NVIS and helicopter air ambulance operations and current international best practices.",
          "Safety issue: Pilots' concern about using manual mode\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 004/21: On 27 May 2021 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation publish an educational article raising awareness of the importance of pilot type training being sufficiently comprehensive to mitigate any risks presented by particular helicopter characteristics",
          "Safety issue: KiwiRail's current policy and procedures regarding information that train controllers should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other factors that are likely to affect the trains' progress are unclear and not consistent with protocols for good communication and crew resource management.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 004/15: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail provide clear guidelines to train controllers on the practice of providing additional advice to train drivers on route setting or any other unusual factors that are likely to affect the progress of or the manner in which they drive their trains.",
          "Safety issue: A better standard of crew resource management could have prevented the grounding in spite of the main engine cooling-water problem.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: When an IFR aeroplane is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current ATC procedures can allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency dependent on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation where the approach controller is unable to contact that flight crew when the controller is still responsible for monitoring that flight crew's compliance with an instruction.\n\n\n",

          "Safety issue: The absence of the 1225 special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 special weather report, while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be examined further to ensure that safety-critical information is passed to crews in a timely manner.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: For a life-raft to be an effective device for increasing the chance of survival in the event of a ditching, it must also be easily extracted from the aircraft so it may be deployed when needed in an emergency.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Had the pilots known that the nose landing gear was not down and locked and then tried the alternate extension procedure, that action would have been unlikely to succeed because debris would probably still have been blocking the restrictor within the hydraulic actuator.\n\n\n",

The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately available to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage operations at subsequent ports. The purpose of the system should not be to replace the mandatory reporting of accidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.\nRecommendation 005/13: The Commission recommends that, once the Marine Legislation Bill has been enacted and the new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force, the Director address this safety issue with all port authorities, including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management Systems.",
          "Safety issue: Had the Pacific Blue pilots turned back towards the aerodrome while climbing to the missed approach altitude of 8500 ft, which was possible under PANS-OPS, a more hazardous scenario might have ensued, because Qantas had already been cleared to descend through the same area.\n\n\n",

The different texts in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services at that time contributed to that misunderstanding.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 015/12: Ensures that operational material published by document holders and approved by the Director is accurate and consistent across all users and complies with the prescribed relevant standards.",
          "Safety issue: The inability to identify the facility where the fuel-transfer tubes had been removed and cleaned in a non-approved manner, indicating a gap in tracking and accountability of maintenance practices.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The council had not evaluated the effects of the subsurface runway irrigation system on the maximum equivalent single wheel load for the Pauanui runway.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 002/14: On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of the Thames-Coromandel District Council that the council establish accurate values for the ESWLs at the aerodromes it operates and that it determine whether the â€œwetâ€ ESWL is appropriate at the Pauanui aerodrome while a wastewater discharge is underway and for any period after the discharge has ended.",
          "Safety issue: The first air traffic controller did not hear the PAN call from NZ5046, and as PAN was not used when the crew repeated their message, he did not recognise that their situation was one of urgency.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The examples given in this report that show the results of using colloquial language, non-standard phraseology and inadequate crew resource management lend weight to the Commission's previous recommendation that the rail industry adopt a national communication standard with which all rail participants must comply.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Lack of a suitable communication system between the train driver and train manager is a serious safety issue raised previously in a Commission report on an incident that occurred in 2006 and the subject of an existing open safety recommendation.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 023/12: The Commission recommends that the chief executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency ensures that systems put in place by New Zealand train operators designed to mitigate this known risk are effective and result in the risk being eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level",
          "Safety issue: The closed-circuit television recording suggested that the loader was waiting by the cargo door for the last passenger to arrive and might not have fully engaged the lock mechanism, assuming the door was either locked or simply caught to stop it swinging open.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The captain's predetermination of what was going to be required to get the landing gear down and locked interfered with the proper following of the QRH checklist; nevertheless, all of the items were covered.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: the system of transferring passengers to another vessel as a means of evacuation was not documented or practised during evacuation drills.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 027/13: the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Auckland Council that he co-ordinates the ferry companies that operate large passenger ferries on the major Hauraki Gulf routes to adopt ferry design features and training programmes aimed at minimising the risk of a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers when the need arises to abandon a passenger ferry.",
          "Safety issue: A light beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef is another measure that probably would have alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of Astrolabe Reef, and would likely have prevented the Rena grounding. However, this needs to be seen in the context of the number of other dangerous rocks and reefs around the New Zealand coastline, the cost versus the benefits of fitting and maintaining light beacons on all such rocks and reefs, the availability and prevalent use of more modern and accurate navigation systems for avoiding such navigational dangers, further advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation that are likely to replace physical light beacons in future, and relevant Resource Management Act considerations.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 013/14: The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consider the use of virtual aids to navigation and monitor progress through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) of the development of performance criteria for them, but meanwhile work with regional councils and port companies to control the use of virtual aids to navigation until they have been fully assessed and appropriate performance criteria set by IATA and Maritime New Zealand.",
          "Safety issue: The CAA had had recurring concerns for the management and standard of operations at Great Barrier Airlines during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions taken to address those concerns had been ineffective.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 001/14: On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he apply stricter requirements upon holders of air operator certificates to take effective action to correct identified deficiencies, and that any serious safety issues that are identified with managerial oversight of airline operations always result in findings.",
          "Safety issue: Assuming that the reason for the nose landing gear not fully extending was debris in the hydraulic fluid, it is possible that cycling the landing gear up and down again would have succeeded in getting all of the landing gear down and locked. However, that action was not recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The CO2 system's pilot cylinder leaked, but the exact cause of the leak could not be determined, indicating a potential oversight in the inspection or maintenance processes for pilot cylinders within the CO2 fire-suppression system.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position. If they had asked the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing gear, it is likely that they would have taken further action in an attempt to get the nose landing gear locked down.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The captain should have explained to the flight attendant the reason for the go-around, even though he believed that the situation had been resolved. The flight attendant would have been better prepared should the landing have been less favourable.\n\n\n",

          "Safety issue: A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations. Had one been fitted the mate might have been alerted in time to prevent the grounding.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 017/12: The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand audits Coastal Bulk Shipping 2007 Limitedâ€™s safe ship management system both ashore and on board the Anatoki to ensure that it meets the standards required by the New Zealand safety management system. (017/12)\nRecommendation 019/12: The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand requires New Zealand-registered coastal vessels operating under one-man-bridge-operation to have a bridge watch navigational and alarm system to mitigate the known risk of sole watchkeepers falling asleep or becoming distracted from monitoring the progress of their vessels. (019/12)",
          "Safety issue: The examination of the handle confirmed that it was possible to align the handle about horizontal, but owing to the play in the handle the locks would not engage until the handle had been pushed firmly slightly past the horizontal and the button had popped. The fading of the button colour degraded its effectiveness as an indicator and as a warning to pilots that the door was possibly insecure.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension procedure did not include key information provided by Bombardier concerning the release handle forces, and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 036/12: On 14 December 2012 the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he liaise with Transport Canada to make other National Aviation Authorities aware of this incident and of the desirability of Dash 8 flight simulators closely representing the actual forces required for a landing gear alternate extension.",
          "Safety issue: The aviation community, including the regulator, Airways, aerodrome operators and aircraft operators, does not have a consistent approach to reducing the collision risks associated with simultaneous opposed circuits at aerodromes.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 021/11: ATC, having cleared an aircraft to make a non-standard circuit, is not prevented from concurrently clearing a following aircraft to join the circuit by the standard overhead joining procedure, even though that could lead to a head-on traffic conflict.\nRecommendation 022/11: The descriptions and requirements for the standard overhead circuit joining procedure that are published in the Civil Aviation Rules, the Aeronautical Information Publication and the Flight Instructorâ€˜s Guide can be misinterpreted or misapplied, particularly if a preceding aircraft is operating in a non-standard circuit, which could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes.\nRecommendation 020/11: The aviation community, including the regulator, Airways, aerodrome operators and aircraft operators, does not have a consistent approach to reducing the risk of simultaneous opposed circuits at aerodromes. Simultaneous opposed circuits can exist as a result of locally agreed procedures at uncontrolled aerodromes, and also at controlled aerodromes under some conditions.",
          "Safety issue: The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes was not assured because the approach clearance issued to Qantas did not allow for a potential communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The use of virtual aids to navigation could be one alternative method for highlighting dangers to navigation. However, they should not be introduced before proper research into, and the development of performance standards for them have been completed.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 013/14: The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consider the use of virtual aids to navigation and monitor progress through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) of the development of performance criteria for them, but meanwhile work with regional councils and port companies to control the use of virtual aids to navigation until they have been fully assessed and appropriate performance criteria set by IATA and Maritime New Zealand.",
          "Safety issue: Some VFR pilots continue to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in Class C and D airspace as the provision of traffic separation.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The failure of the nose landing gear to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator. The debris probably came from damaged seals within the actuator.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The safety issue whereby SIGMETs can be misleading or lack clarity because of insufficient reference to recognisable geographic regions.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 045/10: The interpretation of SIGMETs could be improved by the use of clearer reference to geographical regions, although the requirement to conform to ICAO Standards and Recommended Procedures is appreciated.",
          "Safety issue: The train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before the incident. Train controllers who do not eat properly and regularly during their shifts and/or who do not take rest breaks during their shifts may become mentally fatigued. In these circumstances, train controllers are more likely to make mistakes.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge or medical certificate can take non-paying passengers for a balloon flight.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Airways also required controllers to pass pireps to other aircraft that could be affected, but pireps were not in the AIP list of information that ATC would pass to aircraft.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: KiwiRail's general rule for track closure permits did not require a cross-check confirmation between a train controller and a person in charge of a work site that control blocking protection for the work area had been applied.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The New Zealand regulatory system has not provided sufficient mandatory requirements and guidance for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 003/14: On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation conduct a review of Robinson safety awareness training in New Zealand and facilitate development and adoption of best practice across the sector including a level of consistency in the way instructors deliver the safety awareness training.\nRecommendation 004/14: On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation review FAA SFAR 73 in the context of the New Zealand aviation system and adopt relevant improvements that would likely enhance operational safety of Robinson aircraft in New Zealand.",
          "Safety issue: Indications that the right-hand engine was not performing well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system. However, even if they had been it is unlikely that any subsequent action would have prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Independent audits had found that the Philippine seafarer training system did not meet the standards specified by the STCW Convention at both systemic and training institute levels.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace, but he did not manage the increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane descending to circuit altitude in the opposite direction.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The collision could have been prevented if the bus driver had known how to contact train control, and had immediately done so.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 026/12: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of NZ Transport Agency advise other operators of large road vehicles that their drivers should carry the train control emergency telephone number so that they can alert the train controller in any similar situation\nRecommendation 029/11: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that as a matter of urgency he address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: Airways required all pireps to be passed to MetService, but the first controller said he decided not to pass on the pirep from NZ5046 because he had earlier passed on one from an ATR.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The absence of a requirement for a physical inspection of the booster valve's seating arrangement during maintenance checks could allow deteriorated valves to remain in service, posing a risk to the system's integrity.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 019/11: Critical components in a fixed CO2 gas fire fighting system such as control valves can cause serious harm or immobilise a vessel if they fail. It is a concern that such components are only required to be internally examined every 5 years and are not required to be tested at the design operating pressure at all.\nIt is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forward this report to the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Classification Societies so that they can draw on the lessons learned from this incident and consider amending the current guidelines to require a more robust examination and testing regime for such critical components. (019/11)",
          "Safety issue: The safety information system's default classification of occurrences as \"minor\" when not selected as \"major,\" leading to a delay in notifying the Commission of significant safety concerns.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The use of \"threat and error management\" (TEM) skills by the crew could have prevented the incident. If both pilots had recognised the defective cargo door warning system as a \"threat\" to safety of flight, they almost certainly would have paid close attention to the requirement for a crew member to confirm visually that the door was locked before flight.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The Beach Road/ State Highway 1 intersection did not have a sufficient stacking distance to accommodate this bus, and any other road vehicle over about 10 m in length, without those vehicles encroaching on the rail corridor at the Beach Road level crossing.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 029/11: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that as a matter of urgency he address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: Level crossings warrant special consideration when setting road vehicle standards, because trains have the right of way along the rail corridor and cannot stop for road vehicles in their path.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 029/11: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that as a matter of urgency he address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and conditions that could result in serious injury or death.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: There are no safety issues explicitly stated or inferred in the provided text.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The standard of passage planning on board the Rena often, and in some respects, did not comply with the company safety management system, or with the vessel's safety management system, or with the STCW Convention.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 010/14: The Commission recommends that CIEL evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the issues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena do not affect other vessels within its fleet.",
          "Safety issue: Pilots' reluctance to use appropriate radio phraseology to alert air traffic services and other pilots that an urgent or distress situation exists, potentially stemming from a desire not to attract undue attention. This reluctance can lead to miscommunication and delays in emergency response.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 001/11: The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation promote to all pilots and operators, through the best means available, the need to use the appropriate phraseology to declare a level of urgency or distress that reflects the true nature of an emergency.",
          "Safety issue: The non-transmission, non-receipt or mismanagement of engine condition reports, especially those containing significant deviations from normal, can deprive flight crew and maintenance personnel of the opportunity to identify a potential problem early.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The controller recognised the potential for a conflict, but he provided traffic information to the pilots of the aeroplane only, and not to the pilots of the helicopter.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The reliance on the automation of the safety information system, which contributed to the oversight of the incorrectly classified notification of the occurrence.\n\n\n",

          "Safety issue: The absence of selcall capability on the Wellington passenger fleet meant there was a delay in train control being made aware of the collision and in turn calling the emergency services. In this case the next train coming from the opposite direction arrived at about the same time that the derailment occurred. In other circumstances a delay in train control becoming aware of such an event in double-track territory is a lost opportunity to warn other trains in the vicinity. The delay can be overcome by fitting an improved radio system with selcall capability to the Wellington commuter rail fleet.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 021/12: KiwiRailâ€™s predecessors determined that the Wellington rail electric multiple unit commuter service was not a single-person operation.  Irrespective of whether these trains were a \"single-person\" or a \"two-person\" operation, as a consequence, the radio system fitted to these trains did not have selcall capability and could not send an alert to train control automatically when there was a rapid drop in brake pipe pressure such as when the driver makes an emergency brake application.

          "Safety issue: The practice of testing the booster valve with compressed air at below normal operating pressures was not effective in identifying potential leaks that could occur under full operating conditions.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 019/11: Critical components in a fixed CO2 gas fire fighting system such as control valves can cause serious harm or immobilise a vessel if they fail. It is a concern that such components are only required to be internally examined every 5 years and are not required to be tested at the design operating pressure at all.\nIt is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forward this report to the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Classification Societies so that they can draw on the lessons learned from this incident and consider amending the current guidelines to require a more robust examination and testing regime for such critical components.

          "Safety issue: The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence. Consequently, the role and methods of operation were not clear.\n\n\n",

          "Safety issue: The long-term and recent ingestion of performance-impairing substances such as cannabis by crew of any transport vehicle is a serious safety issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 012/13: The post-mortem toxicology results for the pilot in the Carterton hot air balloon showed that he had a positive result for tetrahydrocannabinol (a constituent of cannabis). It was likely that this was due to 2 factors: first, the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the accident flight; and, second, residual tetrahydrocannabinol, from ingesting cannabis over a longer term, redistributing in the pilotâ€™s blood after his death.\n\nThe Commission found that the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot. It also found that it could not exclude the possibility that the pilot's performance had been impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Commission has inquired into occurrences where persons operating aircraft, vessels or rail vehicles, or where persons performing functions directly relevant to the operation of these, have tested positive for performance-impairing substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol. The Commission is increasingly seeing more occurrences where the use of performance-impairing substances is a feature.\n\nUnless this safety issue is properly addressed, further occurrences where the use of performance-impairing substances is a contributing factor will occur. Legislative or regulatory reform in this area is necessary.\n\nThe Commission, therefore, recommends that the Secretary for Transport complete, as a matter of priority, all necessary work that will support the introduction of appropriate legislation or rules that will:\n- prescribe allowable maximum levels for alcohol\n- prohibit persons from operating an aircraft, vessel or rail vehicle if they are impaired by drugs\n- require operators to implement drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regimes, including random testing\n- prescribe post-occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol.\n\nThis legislation or these rules should apply:\n- across the aviation, maritime and rail transport modes\n- to persons operating an aircraft or a marine craft for recreational purposes.",
          "Safety issue: Local aerodrome user groups benefit their participants by providing information about their respective activities. Aerodrome operators, in order to manage their operational risks, should require their relevant tenants and users to participate fully in such groups.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 024/11: The present voluntary and informal nature of aerodrome user groups restricts their potential for improving operational safety at aerodromes.",
          "Safety issue: The practice of using the runway for perimeter checks outside ATC hours of operation was not standardized, creating an unnecessary risk to airport operations.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Any road vehicle over about 10 m in length could not safely use the Beach Road/ State Highway 1 intersection when turning right to State Highway 1 from Beach Road.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 029/11: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that as a matter of urgency he address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: The use of cannabis by staff performing safety-critical tasks is of concern, and was contrary to KiwiRail's drug and alcohol policy at the time of the incident.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 007/13: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System Standard Executive in developing a National Rail System Standard that requires all rail participants to have drug and alcohol policies that: have zero tolerance of performance-impairing substances for workers engaged in safety-critical tasks; require post-incident and accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol; and require a system for rail workers to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace.",
          "Safety issue: About 19% of all rail level crossings have insufficient available stacking distances available for long road vehicles using adjacent road intersections.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 029/11: The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that as a matter of urgency he address this safety issue.",
          "Safety issue: Drivers of airport vehicles, including Avsec officers, were not trained or required to follow the good aviation practice of checking in both directions before moving onto runways, even when given permission to do so by ATC.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management System did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 005/13: The Commission recommends that, once the Marine Legislation Bill has been enacted and the new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force, the Director address this safety issue with all port authorities, including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management Systems.",
          "Safety issue: Bridge team members later said that closed loop communication was not always used, especially in routine manoeuvres. This was one explanation for why it was used for one helm order and not the next.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The pilot's rescue was due to the fortuitous presence of witnesses on shore. Had he arranged flight-following and made a timely emergency radio call, his rescue might have been more assured even without witnesses.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The Avsec officer did not appreciate that flights could be delayed or that aircraft movements could occur at any time, nor did he appreciate that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The pilot operated over water without having a life jacket on board, contrary to Civil Aviation Rules. Not wearing a life jacket reduced his chances of survival.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: Avsec and airport company procedures had made no provision for vehicles to enter the runway without an ATC clearance outside the hours of operation of ATC, except in the case of an emergency.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The Avsec officer lacked a thorough knowledge of the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The number of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena and its detention in Fremantle for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicates that the safety management system as applied on board the Rena was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 010/14: The Commission recommends that CIEL evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the issues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena do not affect other vessels within its fleet.",
          "Safety issue: The lever in the signal box that was used to change the aspect of Signal 3A at Papakura should have had a double \"blocking\" ability to remind the signaler that 2 authorisations from 2 different people were required before she should change the signal aspect, but the system had not been designed to enable that.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed. His failure to do so was the final act that contributed to the incident.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: No-one involved with loading, shifting and securing the wagon body was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code.\n\nThere were these recommendations made to address the safety issues.\nRecommendation 008/14: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail take steps to ensure that appropriate training is given to all staff involved in load security and that staff responsible for checking load security at the various stages of a train journey are discharging their duties in a manner consistent with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code.\nRecommendation 009/14: The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency ensure that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendation.",
          "Safety issue: The performance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight to 0215, the period leading up to the grounding.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The master's decision to proceed across the Bar without sufficient information on the actual wave conditions over and outside the Bar.\n\n\n",
          "Safety issue: The rescue response from the vessel's master and crew was not well coordinated or practised, taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and attempt resuscitation. Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue attempt would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to survive, which would have been achievable if the entry into enclosed spaces procedure had been followed in the first place.\n\n\n",

          "When an IFR aeroplane is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current ATC procedures can allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency dependent on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation where the approach controller is unable to contact that flight crew when the controller is still responsible for monitoring that flight crew's compliance with an instruction.",
          "The visual circuit procedure put in place by Airways for large aircraft at Queenstown should have had the approval of the Director because it was intended as a permanent change that introduced or varied right-hand circuits.",

          "The crashworthiness of the ELT, which was designed to alert and guide emergency services to a crash site, was inadequate.",
          "While ATC sequences an IFR aeroplane to land and approves the flight crew to conduct a visual approach, current air traffic rules do not require controllers to provide flight crew with their positions in the approach sequence. This information can be crucial to a flight crew conducting a visual approach for them to maintain their situational awareness.",
          "Civil Aviation Rule 91.223 can be interpreted ambiguously in non-standard traffic situations, which could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes.",
          "The incident would have been less likely to occur had the aeroplane pilots immediately broadcast that they had lost sight of the helicopter.",
          "The CAA's use of 'should' in advisory circulars could be misleading, because one could infer that full adherence to the chosen means of compliance is optional.",
          "The council had not evaluated the effects of the subsurface runway irrigation system on the maximum equivalent single wheel load for the Pauanui runway.",
          "The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes was not assured because the approach clearance issued to Qantas did not allow for a potential communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing.",
          "The first air traffic controller did not hear the PAN call from NZ5046, and as PAN was not used when the crew repeated their message, he did not recognise that their situation was one of urgency.",

          "Had the controllers realised that the low cloud around the aerodrome made the visual circuit unsuitable for a jet aeroplane, they could have protected the missed approach for Pacific Blue by a more positive means, such as not clearing Qantas for its approach until Pacific Blue had landed.",
          "The controller recognised the potential for a conflict, but he provided traffic information to the pilots of the aeroplane only, and not to the pilots of the helicopter.",
          "Some VFR pilots continue to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in Class C and D airspace as the provision of traffic separation.",
          "The see-and-avoid principle continues to have relevance, provided pilots and controllers counter its well-known limitations by the appropriate sharing of traffic information.",
          "Pilots, particularly those of jet aeroplanes, making non-precision approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome cannot fully meet the PANS-OPS requirements for such approaches because the runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude.",
          "Some aerodrome controllers are 'over-controlling' VFR traffic in and around the zone, which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies and risks causing difficulties for inexperienced pilots and those for whom English is their second language.",
          "when pilots do not inform their flight-following organisations of changes to their routes or destinations, any search and rescue action that is required could be delayed or misdirected",
          "Changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted some VFR traffic congestion to prominent points outside the zone, and likely increased the risk of collision in those areas.",
          "Had the Pacific Blue pilots turned back towards the aerodrome while climbing to the missed approach altitude of 8500 ft, which was possible under PANS-OPS, a more hazardous scenario might have ensued, because Qantas had already been cleared to descend through the same area.",
          "The controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace, but he did not manage the increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane descending to circuit altitude in the opposite direction.",
          "The lack of a definition of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had created confusion for pilots.",
          "The controllers and the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same understanding of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific Blue was circling. The different texts in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services at that time contributed to that misunderstanding.",

The damage may have been exacerbated by debris in the hydraulic fluid that originated from excessive wear in another actuator in the system, the one that opened and closed the forward nose landing gear doors.",
          "The failure of the nose landing gear to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator. The debris probably came from damaged seals within the actuator.",
          "The isolated nature of the component failure in this occurrence, and the actions the manufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to the relevant maintenance procedures were not warranted.",
          "Indications that the right-hand engine was not performing well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system. However, even if they had been it is unlikely that any subsequent action would have prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.",

          "The similarity of text in adjacent steps of the QRH and the lack of numbered steps contributed to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non-normal procedures. However, these errors did not contribute to the accident.",

The landing gear is not one of those systems, but an undetected maintenance error in the landing gear system has the potential to cause a serious incident or accident.",

          "The Minimum Equipment List provision that had previously allowed a flight to commence without an operative nosewheel steering system appeared to be based on operational considerations only, and to have not considered the possibility of a related system failure.",
          "The captain's predetermination of what was going to be required to get the landing gear down and locked interfered with the proper following of the QRH checklist; nevertheless, all of the items were covered.",
          "The non-transmission, non-receipt or mismanagement of engine condition reports, especially those containing significant deviations from normal, can deprive flight crew and maintenance personnel of the opportunity to identify a potential problem early.",
          "Assuming that the reason for the nose landing gear not fully extending was debris in the hydraulic fluid, it is possible that cycling the landing gear up and down again would have succeeded in getting all of the landing gear down and locked. However, that action was not recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.",

          "The Application for Planned Work submitted by the track ganger was incomplete because it did not include a communication plan, and it contained erroneous information. The work plan therefore should not have been approved by the work planning group.",
          "The amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance operation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less likely to have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the work gang; and it added an additional step using another means of communication. It is a safety issue that the amended communication plan still complied with KiwiRail procedures.",
          "The KiwiRail system for planning track maintenance did not promote the co-ordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation.",
          "Non-compliance with KiwiRail's procedures by the track maintenance work group and the network authority is a safety issue.",
          "Both the track ganger and the protection person had completed their Level C track protection theory training but it could not be determined from KiwiRail's training records whether they had been assessed for and demonstrated competency in their respective roles.",
          "Bulletins are sent out with important information that some recipients do not comprehend or disregard as being unimportant to them. The format of such an important document should be reviewed by KiwiRail in consultation with the target audience to ensure that it clearly conveys the appropriate information.",
          "The New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures did not provide guidance on how to manage work trains within a worksite and did not differentiate between a train moving to a point where work needs to take place and a train carrying out its designated work as a work train.",
          "The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day.",
          "none of the workers, including the production manager, had been trained in or had any knowledge of KiwiRail's non-technical skills practices. The application of these skills could have prevented this incident.",
          "No systematic assessment had been undertaken to identify safety-critical systems and their components, and there were no mandatory checks by people independent of those doing the work that the work had been performed in accordance with the Code.",
          "KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy for \"continuity of core services\" did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed, causing the widespread stoppage of an entire metropolitan passenger rail system.",
          "There was little or no warning system built in to KiwiRail's procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant control system failing due to human error.",
          "A failure by KiwiRail to follow its operating rules and procedures at the planning stage of the work assignment resulted in the work group being under-resourced to manage the protection and safety of the track maintenance workers effectively.",
          "KiwiRail did not have a procedure to cover the operation of the mobility hoist. It had had one in the past, but the instructions had been removed from the Rail Operating Code when the second issue of Section 1 (Passenger Rolling Stock Restrictions) came into effect.",
          "KiwiRail was unable to provide the Commission with the certificate of compliance for the fractured switch rail, indicating a potential gap in recordkeeping or quality assurance processes.",
          "The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence. Consequently, the role and methods of operation were not clear.",
          "KiwiRail's general rule for track closure permits did not require a cross-check confirmation between a train controller and a person in charge of a work site that control blocking protection for the work area had been applied.",
          "No-one involved with loading, shifting and securing the wagon body was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code.",
          "the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader, with all of the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety-critical role of rail protection officer.",
          "the process for planning and approving the worksite allowed one person to carry out the rail protection duties over two separate worksites within a protected work area for a 52.5-hour track occupation period, with no relief",
          "KiwiRail's system for training and assessment did not ensure on this occasion that the track ganger and protection person were correctly certified to undertake the duties they were performing on that day.",
          "Transdev had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train crew in responding to unusual situations.",
          "the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee being assessed completed the online medical questionnaire themselves. There is some evidence that the system could potentially allow managers or others to complete the questionnaire on employees' behalf.",
          "The MDD class special-movement wagon allocated to transport the load from Dunedin to Christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment.",
          "the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains on the New Zealand rail network.",
          "KiwiRail's current policy and procedures regarding information that train controllers should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other factors that are likely to affect the trains' progress are unclear and not consistent with protocols for good communication and crew resource management.",
          "the process for planning and approving the worksite was not fully completed as required by KiwiRail processes",
          "The system for recording and monitoring the effects of track repair and maintenance was not picking up that the repair and maintenance work was not remedying identified track defects.",
          "KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk management system to ensure that relevant personnel performed at adequate levels of alertness.",
          "the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators.",
          "Numerous examples of non-compliance with KiwiRail operating standards were evident at the worksite, of which some were contributory to the accident.",
          "The track ganger should have recognised that the amended communication plan had failed when 2 passenger trains had been allowed through the work area on the adjacent track without being contacted by the protection person.",
          "The track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in accordance with company standards.",
          "The level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan were not robust in detecting and addressing compliance issues in the Invercargill yard.",
          "There was no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature.",
          "The timing of the maintenance work was planned around the availability of the person in charge rather than optimising efficiency with the least disruption to rail services.",
          "The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed. His failure to do so was the final act that contributed to the incident.",
          "The Wellington metro maintenance depot lacked documented task instructions for performing safety-critical tasks on the Ganz Mavag fleet, and there was no means of recording progress against the individual steps in the task.",
          "The special bulletin outlining the plan for the major infrastructure and maintenance work did not present information to maintenance and operational staff in a clear and logical format.",
          "No procedures were in place to direct train crews and controllers in the action to be taken in the event of berthing on the West Main Line.",
          "KiwiRail's safety system could not ensure that infrastructure staff were competent to perform their roles, and could not ensure that the appropriate safety observations and revalidations of current staff competency had been undertaken.",

In this case the next train coming from the opposite direction arrived at about the same time that the derailment occurred. In other circumstances a delay in train control becoming aware of such an event in double-track territory is a lost opportunity to warn other trains in the vicinity. The delay can be overcome by fitting an improved radio system with selcall capability to the Wellington commuter rail fleet.",

The complexity of the relationship between New Zealand and international standards for crewing ships is an issue that New Zealand needs to resolve.",
          "Navigation practices (including crew resource management) are a critical shipboard function that any safety management system should closely monitor to ensure that best industry practice is achieved.",
          "The reliance on weather forecasts and data from distant wave-rider buoys, which may not accurately reflect conditions at the Manukau Bar, leading to underestimation of the risks of crossing the Bar.",
          "The situational awareness of the bridge team on the Rose Harmony was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters.",
          "Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management System did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel.",

          "The watchkeeper was not making the most effective use of the bridge navigation equipment on board the Rena before the grounding.",
          "The number of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena and its detention in Fremantle for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicates that the safety management system as applied on board the Rena was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code.",
          "The standard of passage planning on board the Rena often, and in some respects, did not comply with the company safety management system, or with the vessel's safety management system, or with the STCW Convention.",
          "The IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessels must adhere to, but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that port authorities create and use to meet those same standards.",
          "The safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice.",
          "The electronic navigation aids were not configured to maximize navigation safety, such as by using geo-fencing to alert skippers of hazards or setting depth sounder alarms to warn of shallow water.",
          "The use of virtual aids to navigation could be one alternative method for highlighting dangers to navigation. However, they should not be introduced before proper research into, and the development of performance standards for them have been completed.",

          "crew operating knowledge of on-board emergency systems",
          "Bridge team members later said that closed loop communication was not always used, especially in routine manoeuvres. This was one explanation for why it was used for one helm order and not the next.",
          "crew awareness of the operating limitations of the vessel",
          "The pre-arranged rendezvous with the helicopter to coincide with unloading other vessels at Big South Cape Island possibly influenced the skipper's decision to continue with his planned departure.",
          "The internal audit's recommendations to improve safety had been signed off as completed by the master, but the accident demonstrated that not much had actually changed, indicating a poorly developed safety culture on board.",

          "Some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not follow industry good practice.",
          "If the issues of mechanically unreliable vessels and substandard crew resource management on vessels operating in New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues as they arise.",
          "The bilge pumping system on the Jubilee was not fitted with any means of automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level. If the crew had been alerted to the level of water in the fish hold, it is as likely as not that the sinking would have been prevented.",
          "Port Otago's safety management system fell short of achieving good industry standards for pilotage operations",
          "The means of escape from the Jubilee's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency afforded the crew too few options for escaping in the event of capsize or sinking.",
          "The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena for the accident voyage and particularly the watch period during which the grounding occurred, in almost all respects, did not comply with the industry best practice described in the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines and The Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - a Practical Guide.",
          "The fish hatch was susceptible to being left fully or partially open because it was hydraulically closed from the wheelhouse and could not be latched closed.",
          "The operator's safety management system did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions where its skippers were in effect working alone in the wheelhouse.",
          "Because commercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel in the system.",
          "The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alerted the crew when the bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping system was non-compliant with Maritime Rules. There was no other means fitted to the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew to excess water in the fish hold.",
          "The bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk fell short of achieving good industry practice in both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management.",
          "The vessel's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a common passage plan before the pilotage began. Consequently, the pilot and the vessel's bridge team had different understandings of the planned track to be followed and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan.",
          "Pilot currency and proficiency assessments were not implemented as required by South Port's pilot training and proficiency plan.",
          "Skippers not routinely using electronic navigation aids to full effect, and the lack of routine and frequent use of these aids, which could have prevented the grounding by alerting the skipper to navigational hazards.",
          "Conducting blind pilotage with large ships in confined waters represented risks that had not been fully considered by Environment Southland, the regional authority that regulates maritime activity in the area.",
          "There is limited data to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug use in the New Zealand recreational maritime sector and its impacts on recreational boating accidents.",
          "The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing the risks to ships and the environment.",
          "The challenge in maintaining propeller immersion due to the ship's pitching motion into waves, which is exacerbated by the shallow draught required to navigate over the Bar.",
          "The Rena crew occasionally deviated from the passage plan in an ad-hoc manner and did not always incorporate those deviations into the plan - nor did they adequately monitor the ship's progress against the deviations. Deviating from the passage plan was one factor directly contributing to the grounding.",
          "The master's decision to proceed across the Bar without sufficient information on the actual wave conditions over and outside the Bar.",
          "The high risk of the ship becoming overwhelmed by sea conditions during the estimated 30 minutes it would normally take to clear the Bar, especially when crossing right on the limit of maximum safe operating conditions.",
          "There was no clear delineation of who had control of the Rena at the time of the grounding, and the master, having assumed that he had taken control, had received virtually no information on where the ship was, where it was heading and what immediate dangers to navigation he needed to consider.",
          "The standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice.",
          "The deckhand keeping watch on board the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to be left in sole charge of the watch.",
          "The CIEL oversight of the safety management system as applied on board the Rena was not sufficient to prevent a high number of port state control deficiencies and violations of some company procedures for voyage planning and navigation.",
          "The declaration of \"Red Zone\" was intended to provide a heightened level of vigilance. However, it appears to have had little effect on the actions of the bridge team other than the increased manning level.",
          "The qualifications held by the crew on the Anatoki should have been sufficient to navigate the ship safely on the voyage from Nelson to Tarakohe.",
          "A better standard of crew resource management could have prevented the grounding in spite of the main engine cooling-water problem.",
          "The skipper became distracted by the simultaneous tasks of following the pod of dolphins and giving the passenger commentary over the public address system, to the detriment of monitoring the progress of the vessel in relation to navigation dangers.",
          "The master not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging with the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency management protocols that left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware of the issue they were dealing with. This breach contributed to the Hanjin Bombay grounding.",
          "Inconsistencies in the application of Rule 40D may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards. A further 50 fishing vessels have been afforded grandparent rights that will allow them to operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards under the current Maritime Rules.",
          "The voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management on the bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the IMO standards or follow the guidelines published in other leading industry publications.",
          "The design of the closures on the ventilation grilles around the fish processing deck.",
          "A historical lack of common and good-standard practice for keeping ship operation and safety records has resulted in the loss of important information about commercial vessels that are still operating today.",
          "Eight of the 12 vessels managed by CIEL had higher rates of deficiencies per inspection than the average of all other vessels subjected to port state control inspections in the Asia-Pacific region in the same period. The Rena's deficiency rate was almost twice the average. This indicated that the CIEL safety management system for the vessels operating in the Asia-Pacific region, and for the Rena, was not functioning as it could have been according to the ISM Code.",
          "The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties.",
          "The standard of bridge resource management on the Monte Stello leading up to the grounding was not as high as that found operating on the other three vessels operated under KiwiRail's safety management system.",
          "The flammability of some materials used on the fish processing deck.",
          "The lack of a wave-rider buoy near the Manukau Bar to provide accurate and timely data on wave conditions, compounded by the difficulty in maintaining navigation aids in the area.",
          "The operator had identified the risk of skippers becoming distracted by giving commentary but had only really identified the risk in certain situations, such as transiting the Hole in the Rock, and not in the broader context of navigating close to navigational dangers while engaging with wildlife.",
          "The performance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight to 0215, the period leading up to the grounding.",
          "The grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive or active escort role.",
          "The crew were not adequately monitoring and fixing the Rena's position as the ship approached Astrolabe Reef and the port of Tauranga.",
          "The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay fell well short of international industry best practice.",
          "The operation of L'Austral's ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator's safety management system.",
          "There is a lack of advice and guidance in the Maritime Rules on what is an acceptable standard for surveyors to approve when the Maritime Rules defer to the surveyors' discretion.",
          "Napier pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the Napier Pilotage Area and that the outward pilotage limit was not legal.",
          "The pre-manoeuvre briefing (completion of the Tory Channel Eastern Inbound Approach checklist) did not include any discussion about the actual planned passage, nor reminders about responsibilities (for example pilot/co-pilot), nor was \"Red Zone\" declared. The first two points were not included in the checklist. However, they are an integral part of effective BRM practice. The briefing did not result in a shared mental model across the bridge team.",
          "The IDAS Bulker was not under the control of a licensed pilot when navigating within a pilotage area, contrary to the requirements of the Maritime Rules and the Hawke's Bay Regional Council Navigation Safety Bylaws.",
          "The compass error was infrequently checked and was not checked at all on the voyage from Napier to Tauranga.",
          "A light beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef is another measure that probably would have alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of Astrolabe Reef, and would likely have prevented the Rena grounding. However, this needs to be seen in the context of the number of other dangerous rocks and reefs around the New Zealand coastline, the cost versus the benefits of fitting and maintaining light beacons on all such rocks and reefs, the availability and prevalent use of more modern and accurate navigation systems for avoiding such navigational dangers, further advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation that are likely to replace physical light beacons in future, and relevant Resource Management Act considerations.",
          "the training in place for the crew around the configuration of the emergency stops likely resulted in confusion on which emergency stops serviced which system.",
          "The firefighting drills held on board the Taokas Wisdom were not effective in ensuring that all crew were familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire.",
          "The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred.",
          "The level of bridge resource management on the bridge did not meet industry good practice. The bridge team could not effectively monitor the execution of the pilotage because they did not have an agreed specific pilot plan, or agreed monitoring parameters appropriate to the weather conditions at the time.",
          "The primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral, the ECDIS, was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features.",
          "A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations. Had one been fitted the mate might have been alerted in time to prevent the grounding.",

          "The mooring procedures contained in the port company's SMS were not strictly adhered to and the procedure in the event of a high wind warning was ineffective.",

          "The rescue response from the vessel's master and crew was not well coordinated or practised, taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and attempt resuscitation. Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue attempt would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to survive, which would have been achievable if the entry into enclosed spaces procedure had been followed in the first place.",
          "When an accident or incident occurs that requires a passenger ferry operating in Auckland's congested Hauraki Gulf to abandon ship, it is highly likely that this will be achieved by a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers and crew. This scenario should be included in emergency response training and drills, and passenger ferries from all companies operating in the same area should be designed to minimise the risks of such an operation.",

          "There are indications that people may not have a sufficient understanding of the design and capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or of the importance of wearing a lifejacket of the correct size and type for any situation where there is a risk of people ending up in the water.",
          "The Easy Rider's life-raft was in current survey and was properly installed, but was not able to float free to the surface because it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as the vessel was sinking. Rated for 4 persons only, the life-raft did not have sufficient capacity to cater for the 9 persons on board.",
          "The Easy Rider was loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff.",
          "Maritime rules that specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels are based only on how far the vessels are permitted to travel from the coast. The rules do not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on exposed coastlines, where higher-specification lifejackets would be more appropriate.",
          "There were as few as 4 approved lifejackets on board the Easy Rider to be shared among 9 people, which not only contravened Maritime Rules but significantly reduced the chances of persons not wearing lifejackets surviving in the water after the vessel capsized.",
          "There were 24 passengers on board the Torea when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers.",
          "It could not be established what training the deceased deck crew member had received in the hazards of entering closed cargo hold, but he might not have been aware of why the chief officer was unconscious, or may simply have been overwhelmed by an emotional urge to perform the rescue in spite of the danger to himself.",
          "The weather conditions were not suitable for the Easy Rider to venture across Foveaux Strait at night, with marginal stability and with passengers on board.",
          "Being a dedicated log carrier, the risk of death by entering closed cargo holds containing logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency response training programme, yet no evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed.",
          "The owner of the Easy Rider was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe operation of the vessel, as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules.",
          "The skipper's intention was for the Easy Rider to operate as a commercial fishing vessel on the accident voyage, as he fully intended to go fishing commercially once his passengers and their equipment had been offloaded.",
          "It has not been possible to determine how many, if any, of the 8 persons who died survived the initial capsize, and if so for how long they survived.",
          "The Easy Rider did not have sufficient life-saving equipment for the 9 persons on board.",
          "The Easy Rider capsized when it was engulfed by what was probably a large breaking wave, which reduced the vessel's stability by landing sea water onto the fishing deck, at the same time as rolling the vessel past the angle where it lost any chance of recovery.",
          "the system of transferring passengers to another vessel as a means of evacuation was not documented or practised during evacuation drills.",
          "Neither the owner nor the skipper sought or was given a dispensation by the safe ship management company or the Director of Maritime New Zealand to operate as a pleasure vessel for the accident voyage, which meant that the Easy Rider was a commercial fishing vessel and should not have been carrying any person other than its crew.",
          "The skipper did not have the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if he did, he did not apply it wisely when loading the Easy Rider for the trip. The Easy Rider being overloaded, with the average distribution of weight being too high, was the prime factor leading to its capsize.",

          "The train driver did not challenge the train controller when told by him that his train was routed to cross over onto what he had known was a section of track closed for maintenance work.",
          "The eProtect KMC module on board the locomotive had been transmitting error messages for three weeks before the incident, but the activity database was not being monitored for this type of error.",
          "The amendments to the Rule did not consider the risks to road and rail users at level crossings in close proximity to road intersections.",
          "Level crossings warrant special consideration when setting road vehicle standards, because trains have the right of way along the rail corridor and cannot stop for road vehicles in their path.",
          "The existing system allowed for heavy trains to use the crossing loop, which had previously been identified as a risk following a similar derailment in 2016, but no preventive measures were implemented until after this incident.",
          "Veolia had updated its safety case to reflect the 2006 contract variation that saw it take responsibility for 3 signal boxes, but it had not developed a plan within its safety system to show how it intended to manage the operation. Rather it relied on the train control/signaller experience within its management team to provide oversight of the function.",
          "The level of protection for people using pedestrian level crossings in the Auckland metro network is currently inadequate because the risk assessment process for pedestrian level crossings is not keeping pace with the infrastructure changes and increasing patronage.",
          "The visual inspection regime for wheel-bearings is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure, as it failed to detect the impending failure in this case.",
          "The lever in the signal box that was used to change the aspect of Signal 3A at Papakura should have had a double \"blocking\" ability to remind the signaler that 2 authorisations from 2 different people were required before she should change the signal aspect, but the system had not been designed to enable that.",
          "Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained. As a result, potential risk-mitigation actions that were required prior to the issue of the permit were not completed. Not obtaining a permit increased the risk to road and rail users approaching the crossing.",
          "The relatively high centre of gravity of the loaded coal wagons, while within permissible limits, contributed to the overall effect of dynamic interaction, reducing the stability of the wagons.",
          "The driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during the collision sequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their driving positions before impact they would likely have been fatally injured.",
          "The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing.",
          "Fretting between the starboard propeller hub and the tail shaft and corrosion on the metal surface of the tail shaft would have likely decreased its fatigue strength.",
          "The absence of the interlock on the Ganz Mavag sets placed a greater reliance on driver performance and the design of the door-alert system to prevent a premature train departure.",
          "The Beach Road/ State Highway 1 intersection did not have a sufficient stacking distance to accommodate this bus, and any other road vehicle over about 10 m in length, without those vehicles encroaching on the rail corridor at the Beach Road level crossing.",
          "The sighting distance available to drivers of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea Road level crossing safely did not comply with the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual.",
          "The profile of the Beach Road level crossing and the adjacent section of road leading up to the intersection with State Highway 1 were not well suited for long and low road vehicles.",
          "The National Rail System Standards (NRSS) did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard, resulting in the train brake system not being optimised for low-adhesion conditions.",
          "The left-hand switch rail fractured and misaligned due to a fatigue crack initiated from a chatter mark introduced during the machining process, leading to the derailment.",
          "The quality of the fit achieved between the tapered propeller tail shaft and the propeller hub when the new propeller was fitted during the extension project was likely to have been the reason for the fretting.",
          "The lack of a requirement for a second person to verify the correct setting and isolation of points at crossing loops introduces a risk of single-person errors leading to incidents.",
          "There were several procedural lapses by three experienced rail staff members between the coupling of the two locomotives at Auckland and the train examiner's dismounting from the train 12 hours later.",
          "About 19% of all rail level crossings have insufficient available stacking distances available for long road vehicles using adjacent road intersections.",
          "The train driver's reliance on incorrect information received from train control and the workgroup team leader, without verifying the points' setting at the crossing loop, led to a signal passed at danger (SPAD) incident.",
          "The legislation is not clear on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of road and rail users at public road level crossings.",
          "The signaller was certified and therefore qualified to operate the Papakura signal box, but she had had only 8 months' total experience as a signal box controller and had not worked there in the previous 6 months, which may not have been enough total and recent experience to deal with the complexity of operations at the time of the incident.",
          "A large percentage of pedestrian level crossings located in provincial areas do not fully conform with guidelines within the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual - Part 9 - Level Crossings.",
          "The crossing loops' semi-automatic system lacks visibility for train control regarding how the points are set or what the signals are displaying, requiring manual input from train drivers to activate the points to enter a crossing loop.",
          "The signalling system provided a proceed signal into the damaged section because the electrical circuit was completed despite the switch rail being fractured, which did not prevent the train from entering the faulty track section.",
          "Changes in the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass have been made with little formal consideration for the compatibility of long and low road vehicles with existing rail level crossings throughout New Zealand.",
          "The regulatory and operational accountabilities of the Auckland metro system do not expressly deal with responsibility for safety and control at the boundaries between station platforms and the rail corridor.",
          "The cracks in the starboard rudder stock were fatigue cracks. Owing to their position and depth, they were most probably linked to cavitation forces applied to the starboard rudder from the starboard propeller. These forces were likely outside those expected in normal operations.",
          "The high incidence of brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure, was not addressed by putting the wagon under an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule.",
          "The procedure for manually setting and isolating points at crossing loops to prevent automatic resetting and ensure trains pass straight on the main line was not correctly followed, leading to the freight train being wrongly routed into the loop.",
          "Excessive speed, combined with a track twist within code and the high centre of gravity of the load on the derailed wagons, led to the derailment due to dynamic interaction.",
          "The wagon was authorised to return to service following a routine maintenance inspection with wheel flange surface roughness outside specified limits.",
          "The Matangi braking and wheel-slide protection systems were not performing as well as they could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for optimum braking in low-adhesion conditions before the trains were commissioned to service.",
          "When the three staff members came together to couple the third locomotive to the disabled train at Glenbrook, no challenge and confirm actions were taken to complete a fundamental brake test procedure, which was designed to ensure that the trains' air brakes were functioning correctly.",
          "there was insufficient management of the rail protection officer's day-to-day workload, which likely contributed to his being fatigued at the time he reported the track as clear, when it was not.",
          "The signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment capabilities in the Wellington yard that they were controlling.",
          "Driver B was able to set the brake handles incorrectly because there was no interlock capability between the two driving cabs of the DL-class locomotives. The incorrect brake set-up resulted in driver B not having brake control over the coupled wagons.",
          "There is a potential safety issue with the ergonomics of the driver door-alert system on the Ganz Mavag sets.",
          "The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems.",
          "The RPO allowed a signals technician to enter the PWA without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902, resulting in a significant safety barrier being breached.",
          "The incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff.",
          "Sighting distances for road users at level crossings are one of the factors used to determine the appropriate level of protection required, yet the growth in vegetation around railway level crossings can change sighting distances in a relatively short time and render the level crossings unsafe.",
          "Current inspection procedures were unable to detect the chatter marks on the outer foot of the installed switch rail, indicating a limitation in the effectiveness of track inspection methods to identify potential rail defects.",
          "Level crossing assessments do not require the road profile and the alignment of roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured. Therefore, there are no checks made to ensure that all road-legal vehicles can pass over level crossings without becoming stuck.",
          "The lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst position and an agreed process for monitoring, reviewing, and acting on RailBAM data contributed to the failure to adequately address detected bearing faults before the derailment occurred.",
          "The signaller had not undergone the required formal level A safety observations after gaining certifications at both the Papakura and Pukekohe signal boxes.",
          "Misunderstandings and procedural lapses allowed the signals technician to commence work in the rail corridor with a false sense of security, potentially putting them at risk from rail traffic.",
          "The Matangi braking and wheel-slide protection systems were not performing as well as they could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for optimum braking in low-adhesion conditions before the trains were commissioned to service.",
          "A key safety issue was that the National Rail System Standards (NRSS) did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard. Consequently, the train brake system had not been optimised for low-adhesion conditions.",
          "The rail fracture examination revealed that the fracture was consistent with a fatigue crack, and the rail as manufactured met all standards and specifications required, yet it failed in service, indicating potential inadequacies in the rail manufacturing or inspection processes.",
          "The design of the passenger door-alert system did not follow the convention where the colour red means \"danger\" or \"stop\" and green means \"go\" or \"safe\", which could lead to confusion and unsafe conditions.",
          "The RailBAM system, while operational, did not effectively prevent the derailment due to the procedures in place at the time, which did not prioritize the investigation and remediation of detected faults unless they reached a severity level that was considered critical.",
          "The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer-controlled brake and wheel-slide protection systems.",
          "Ultrasonic testing, designed to detect cracks in the head and web of the rail, is unable to detect defects originating from the foot of the rail unless such defects propagate into the web, indicating a limitation in the technology's ability to detect certain types of rail defects.",
          "The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer-controlled brake and wheel-slide protection systems.",
          "The process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensured that the mimic screen matched the physical track layout, and had not detected the absence of an interlock to prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration over which it was not possible for rail traffic to travel.",
          "The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems.",
          "The standard of maintenance for a safety-critical braking system, particularly the procedures for ensuring that maintenance was conducted in accordance with best engineering practice and that there were independent final checks of critical systems before electric multiple units were released back into service.",
          "Records show that the signaller had successfully passed her theory training for signalling operations, but gaps were noted relating to her practical training using the Mis.60 procedure. This gap in her training had never been resolved.",
          "Any road vehicle over about 10 m in length could not safely use the Beach Road/ State Highway 1 intersection when turning right to State Highway 1 from Beach Road.",
          "The axle-counter system used for signalling does not detect broken rails as effectively as traditional track-circuited systems might, potentially increasing the risk of incidents related to rail fractures not being detected.",
          "The supply agreement did not specify a surface roughness standard for machined components, allowing for the presence of chatter marks that reduced the fatigue and fracture resistance of the rail.",
          "The absence of trackside distance markers to support the stabilised approach braking technique potentially compromises the ability of train drivers to control train speed and stop before signals at crossing loops.",
          "Miscommunication between the workgroup team leader and train control regarding the status of points, and the failure to confirm and correctly document the points' status, contributed to the incident.",
          "The Ganz trains were generally strong and well-built and had met the crashworthiness standards at the time of build some 30 years earlier, but they did not perform as well as a modern train during a similar front-end collision, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the drivers and possibly passengers seated near the ends of the trains.",

          "When an IFR aeroplane is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current ATC procedures can allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency dependent on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation where the approach controller is unable to contact that flight crew when the controller is still responsible for monitoring that flight crew's compliance with an instruction.",

          "The controllers and the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same understanding of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific Blue was circling. The different texts in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services at that time contributed to that misunderstanding.",

          "Despite the general acceptance of final inspections after all work has been completed and before the aeroplane is returned to service as best aeronautical engineering practice, incidents of rags being left in the aircraft occurred, indicating a need for more thorough inspections and adherence to procedures developed to prevent foreign objects from being left behind after maintenance.",
          "Had the controllers realised that the low cloud around the aerodrome made the visual circuit unsuitable for a jet aeroplane, they could have protected the missed approach for Pacific Blue by a more positive means, such as not clearing Qantas for its approach until Pacific Blue had landed.",
          "There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before the officer entered the runway outside the normal hours of ATC.",
          "Pilots, particularly those of jet aeroplanes, making non-precision approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome cannot fully meet the PANS-OPS requirements for such approaches because the runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude.",
          "The Avsec officer did not appreciate that flights could be delayed or that aircraft movements could occur at any time, nor did he appreciate that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active.",
          "Airways also required controllers to pass pireps to other aircraft that could be affected, but pireps were not in the AIP list of information that ATC would pass to aircraft.",
          "Some aerodrome controllers are 'over-controlling' VFR traffic in and around the zone, which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies and risks causing difficulties for inexperienced pilots and those for whom English is their second language.",
          "While ATC sequences an IFR aeroplane to land and approves the flight crew to conduct a visual approach, current air traffic rules do not require controllers to provide flight crew with their positions in the approach sequence. This information can be crucial to a flight crew conducting a visual approach for them to maintain their situational awareness.",
          "The controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace, but he did not manage the increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane descending to circuit altitude in the opposite direction.",
          "The controller recognised the potential for a conflict, but he provided traffic information to the pilots of the aeroplane only, and not to the pilots of the helicopter.",
          "Local aerodrome user groups benefit their participants by providing information about their respective activities. Aerodrome operators, in order to manage their operational risks, should require their relevant tenants and users to participate fully in such groups.",
          "variances in lighting seen at Auckland Airport are a safety issue that the Commission is recommending that the chief executive of Auckland Airport address.",
          "The means of escape from the Jubilee's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency afforded the crew too few options for escaping in the event of capsize or sinking.",
          "The incident would not have occurred had either of the aeroplane pilots stopped the descent when he lost sight of the helicopter.",
          "The Avsec officer lacked a thorough knowledge of the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting.",
          "Foreign objects left inside an aircraft and around safety-critical components such as flight control systems are a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Loose articles can move inside an aircraft and become trapped under moving components, such as control cables and levers, disrupting the normal operation of aircraft systems and damaging system components.",
          "The defence of 'see and avoid' is not foolproof against mid-air collisions and, despite repeated efforts to educate pilots about safety around aerodromes, these types of accidents continue to occur.",
          "administrative errors were identified in the advisory circular AC139-6 current at the time of this incident, which had the potential to create ambiguity in the way the relevant ICAO standards and recommended practices for airport design and operations were interpreted.",
          "The procedure for circling below the minimum descent altitude after an instrument approach to Queenstown Aerodrome needs to be clarified to ensure pilots and controllers are in no doubt as to their respective actions to achieve separation from other traffic.",
          "The practice of using the runway for perimeter checks outside ATC hours of operation was not standardized, creating an unnecessary risk to airport operations.",
          "There is no effective means of ensuring that the common operational information and procedures published by certificated organisations for their internal use are accurate and consistent. That deficiency inevitably results in differences that lead to misunderstandings between operational staff, which can compromise the safety of operations.",
          "The bilge pumping system on the Jubilee was not fitted with any means of automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level. If the crew had been alerted to the level of water in the fish hold, it is as likely as not that the sinking would have been prevented.",
          "The high risk of the ship becoming overwhelmed by sea conditions during the estimated 30 minutes it would normally take to clear the Bar, especially when crossing right on the limit of maximum safe operating conditions.",
          "Airways had not clearly explained to operators that it expected large aircraft that did not land at Queenstown after circling to enter the visual aerodrome circuit.",
          "The visual circuit procedure put in place by Airways for large aircraft at Queenstown should have had the approval of the Director because it was intended as a permanent change that introduced or varied right-hand circuits.",
          "The lack of a definition of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had created confusion for pilots.",
          "Airways required all pireps to be passed to MetService, but the first controller said he decided not to pass on the pirep from NZ5046 because he had earlier passed on one from an ATR.",
          "The report of loose objects on one flight deck suggested pilots should take more care to secure items under their control.",
          "Aerodrome managers, in particular those at unattended aerodromes, lacked the guidance and understanding of their roles and accountabilities regarding the CARs and the Health and Safety at Work regulations, which was necessary to be able to discharge their responsibilities and ensure the safe operation of their aerodrome.",
          "Civil Aviation Rule 91.223 can be interpreted ambiguously in non-standard traffic situations, which could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes.",
          "Changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted some VFR traffic congestion to prominent points outside the zone, and likely increased the risk of collision in those areas.",
          "The design of the closures on the ventilation grilles around the fish processing deck.",
          "Some VFR pilots continue to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in Class C and D airspace as the provision of traffic separation.",
          "The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes was not assured because the approach clearance issued to Qantas did not allow for a potential communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing.",
          "The see-and-avoid principle continues to have relevance, provided pilots and controllers counter its well-known limitations by the appropriate sharing of traffic information.",
          "When aircraft maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness for a task, perhaps because they are very familiar with the basic task and do not know that the task documentation has changed, safety might be compromised.",
          "The challenge in maintaining propeller immersion due to the ship's pitching motion into waves, which is exacerbated by the shallow draught required to navigate over the Bar.",
          "The incomplete and inaccurate AIP reference to Civil Aviation Rule 91.413(e) was likely a factor in the routine non-compliance with the Rule by pilots making non-precision approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome.",
          "The descriptions of and requirements for the standard overhead circuit joining procedure that are published in Civil Aviation Rules, the Aeronautical Information Publication and the Flight Instructor's Guide can be misinterpreted or misapplied in non-standard traffic situations. This could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes.",
          "The fish hatch was susceptible to being left fully or partially open because it was hydraulically closed from the wheelhouse and could not be latched closed.",

          "A failure by KiwiRail to follow its operating rules and procedures at the planning stage of the work assignment resulted in the work group being under-resourced to manage the protection and safety of the track maintenance workers effectively.",
          "The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence. Consequently, the role and methods of operation were not clear.",
          "The track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in accordance with company standards.",

          "the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains on the New Zealand rail network.",
          "There was no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature.",
          "The New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures did not provide guidance on how to manage work trains within a worksite and did not differentiate between a train moving to a point where work needs to take place and a train carrying out its designated work as a work train.",
          "Transdev had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train crew in responding to unusual situations.",
          "the process for planning and approving the worksite allowed one person to carry out the rail protection duties over two separate worksites within a protected work area for a 52.5-hour track occupation period, with no relief",
          "KiwiRail's current policy and procedures regarding information that train controllers should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other factors that are likely to affect the trains' progress are unclear and not consistent with protocols for good communication and crew resource management.",
          "the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators.",

          "All three Robinson helicopter models are susceptible to low-G mast-bumping, and any preventive measures should apply to all of them.",
          "The practice of allowing a loader to close and lock the cargo door probably led the first officer to believe the loader had done so on this occasion, but this was no defence for him not to follow a specific instruction; to check it himself.",
          "The challenge for pilots in accurately assessing wind conditions and their effect on helicopter performance during landing approaches, particularly in remote or confined areas, which can lead to inappropriate approach paths and increase the risk of accidents.",
          "The lack of evidence of any corrective action by the pilot, suggesting it is about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll, prior to the point that a turn was required to maintain the optimum line on the airstrip.",
          "The unique handling characteristics of helicopters equipped with Fenestron tail rotors, particularly the increased right pedal input required as the helicopter slows to a hover, which may not be intuitively understood by pilots transitioning from different helicopter types or with limited experience.",
          "The closed-circuit television recording suggested that the loader was waiting by the cargo door for the last passenger to arrive and might not have fully engaged the lock mechanism, assuming the door was either locked or simply caught to stop it swinging open.",
          "The original fault of the cargo door annunciator light remaining illuminated after the door was closed and locked was not critical provided a crew member visually confirmed the door was locked. However, the faded paint on the visual lock indicator meant positive confirmation of the door being closed required a close-up check of the indicator.",
          "The actual wind and turbulence at the time of the accident were very likely to have been the same as, or stronger than, the forecast conditions.",
          "Unapproved maintenance and modifications to the helicopter, including a dent in the tail rotor blade, unapproved battery system modification, and unapproved repairs to the main rotor blades.",
          "The importance of pilot training to include emergency procedures for handling unanticipated yaw events, especially for helicopters equipped with Fenestron tail rotors, to ensure pilots can respond effectively to prevent loss of control.",
          "The modification of the cockpit lighting adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, when the dimmer was on.",
          "Carburettor icing conditions that presented a moderate risk at the time of the accident, with the carburettor heating control found in the OFF position.",
          "Although not an intuitive reaction to a sudden right roll, the aft cyclic technique is the only approved recovery technique, and should be used as soon as low-G is felt to 'reload' the main rotor disc and help reduce any right roll.",
          "An abrupt, inappropriate or inadvertent cyclic control input by the pilot could not be ruled out as having contributed to the in-flight break-up.",
          "The importance of some critical safety information in Robinson flight manuals was likely to have been diminished by Robinson's use of \"Caution\", rather than \"Warning\", for operating conditions and practices that involve a risk of personal injury or loss of life.",
          "The use of \"threat and error management\" (TEM) skills by the crew could have prevented the incident. If both pilots had recognised the defective cargo door warning system as a \"threat\" to safety of flight, they almost certainly would have paid close attention to the requirement for a crew member to confirm visually that the door was locked before flight.",
          "the initial design of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket meant the hook-and-loop fastener system had the potential to come undone during operations",
          "A pilot's instinctive reaction to an unexpected right roll, or the unintentional movement of a pilot's limbs or upper body during severe turbulence or low-G, could lead to mast-bumping.",
          "earlier research into the flight control systems and dynamic behaviour of the main rotor of lightweight helicopters, such as the design used by Robinson, was not completed as intended. Until the behaviour of such rotor systems in conditions of low G and turbulence is fully understood, it is possible that not all of the causal factors of mast bump accidents will be identified.",
          "The operator's procedures did not require pilots using open-descent mode to reset the Flight Control Unit (FCU) to the next intermediate altitude restriction, which could reduce the effectiveness of descent management and increase the risk of altitude breaches.",
          "Air traffic control's failure to alert the flight crew immediately upon observing the aircraft descending below the minimum altitude restrictions represents a missed opportunity to prevent or mitigate the altitude breach.",
          "The potential for pilots, especially those with limited experience, to be startled by an unanticipated yaw, especially during critical phases of flight such as landing approaches, which can lead to a loss of control if not promptly and correctly addressed.",
          "Pilots' concern about using manual mode",
          "The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same as those for new blades. Blades that had been through that repair process, without verification of critical dimensions, might fail before the next 3,000-hour inspection.",
          "The ISO standards for large-propeller manufacturing might not be suitable for more modern, high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins.",
          "The pilot's operation of the helicopter with a load that inadvertently made contact with the tree canopy or the inability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tree canopy.",
          "A mast-bump occurred, which led to rotor divergence and the in-flight break-up.",
          "Had a previous limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots remained in place, as per that for R22 pilots, the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the time of the accident due to the forecast strong winds and turbulence.",
          "The in-flight break-up was very unlikely to have been caused by low main rotor RPM (revolutions per minute).",
          "the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked on snow while the rotors are turning is hazardous.",
          "The examination of the handle confirmed that it was possible to align the handle about horizontal, but owing to the play in the handle the locks would not engage until the handle had been pushed firmly slightly past the horizontal and the button had popped. The fading of the button colour degraded its effectiveness as an indicator and as a warning to pilots that the door was possibly insecure.",
          "more educational material is needed to alert operators to the risk of contaminated fuel when operating and refuelling in remote, dusty environments.",
          "The lack of a requirement for flight crews to actively use onboard systems, such as the navigation display, to monitor the aircraft's compliance with altitude restrictions during descent in open-descent mode, potentially compromises situational awareness and flight safety.",
          "The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and conditions that could result in serious injury or death.",
          "The flight crew's reliance on open-descent mode without adequately monitoring and ensuring compliance with intermediate altitude restrictions led to the aircraft descending below the minimum permitted altitude.",
          "Visual impairment due to the sun being low on the horizon directly ahead of the flight track, potentially affecting the pilot's ability to determine the helicopter's height above the tree canopy.",
          "With the locks not being fully engaged, the vibration generated during the taxi to the take-off position was sufficient to cause the locks to back off. The locks finally released and the door opened at about the point of rotation during take-off, indicating that the locking mechanism's integrity was compromised by vibration and incomplete engagement.",
          "The Robinson helicopter flight manuals do not conform to the aviation industry practice for the use of \"Warnings\" to emphasise flight conditions and operating practices that can cause death or serious injury.",
          "There was insufficient guidance to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations.",
          "The helicopter's airworthiness was compromised by factors such as the main rotor blades exceeding their finite calendar life, disabled engine-hour meter, unrecorded flight hours, and expired review of airworthiness.",
          "The incident was a result of the door not being closed properly by the loader and then the first officer not checking that it was locked as he was required to do. It also involved a number of unchecked assumptions being made by the loader, first officer, and captain about the actions or intended actions of others.",
          "Due to their unique main rotor design, during a sudden and prolonged low-G condition Robinson helicopters can roll rapidly to the right and likely break up before a pilot can recover.",
          "four of the seven fatal R66 accidents that have occurred globally since the type was introduced into service in 2010 were mast bump or low-main-rotor-RPM accidents, accident types seen with the smaller R22 and R44, which have the same main rotor design. However, the R66 was certificated without any special pilot training requirements or operating restrictions such as the minimum pilot experience and maximum wind strength that apply to the R22",
          "The condition of the helicopter's engine, including evidence of not sealing properly, excessive wear, and incorrect spark plug types, which could have reduced the available power and reliability.",
          "The need for comprehensive training and experience to safely conduct operations in remote, confined, or off-aerodrome landing sites, including the ability to perform thorough reconnaissance passes and understand the implications of wind direction and speed.",
          "The manufacturer of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket had not promulgated key operational information on and limitations of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket to operators.",
          "The difficulty in identifying the underlying causes of mast bump accidents involving Robinson helicopters due to the usually fatal nature of these accidents and the destructive impact of in-flight break-ups, which complicates efforts to make meaningful recommendations for preventing similar accidents.",
          "the flight manuals for Robinson helicopters did not adequately warn pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump",
          "The helicopter was loaded above its maximum certified weight limit for the rescue flight and would have further exceeded it on the return flight.",
          "The helicopter very likely encountered moderate to severe turbulence and an associated severe downdraught in the lee of Mt Arthur, which likely created a prolonged low-G condition.",

Rated for 4 persons only, the life-raft did not have sufficient capacity to cater for the 9 persons on board.",
          "Pilots' reluctance to use appropriate radio phraseology to alert air traffic services and other pilots that an urgent or distress situation exists, potentially stemming from a desire not to attract undue attention. This reluctance can lead to miscommunication and delays in emergency response.",
          "For a life-raft to be an effective device for increasing the chance of survival in the event of a ditching, it must also be easily extracted from the aircraft so it may be deployed when needed in an emergency.",
          "The risk to people involved in helicopter operations over water will be reduced if quick-donning life jackets are worn at all times where there is the potential for the helicopter to ditch with short notice.",
          "The operator expected the tandem master to have the reserve parachute pack for flotation and therefore did not require them to also wear a lifejacket.",
          "The tendency to not wear helmets increased the risk of injury.",
          "Pilots who are not approved for or not familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand radioed position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints. The communication gap that this potentially creates is a safety issue.",
          "There were 24 passengers on board the Torea when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers.",
          "It could not be established why the chief officer, a veteran of the sea, and senior officer on board would have ignored the warnings given by the bosun and entered the cargo hold, particularly as number 5 cargo hold was not one of those identified by the fumigator as needing water removed.",
          "It could not be established what training the deceased deck crew member had received in the hazards of entering closed cargo hold, but he might not have been aware of why the chief officer was unconscious, or may simply have been overwhelmed by an emotional urge to perform the rescue in spite of the danger to himself.",

          "Float-free emergency position indicating radio beacons and the enhancement of people carrying personal locator beacons will improve the chances of being noticed and rescued, particularly in the event of a sudden or catastrophic event such as a capsize.",
          "Parachute drop pilots were not required to wear lifejackets or flotation devices if their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land. That scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to use the emergency parachute when over or near water.",
          "The pilot's rescue was due to the fortuitous presence of witnesses on shore. Had he arranged flight-following and made a timely emergency radio call, his rescue might have been more assured even without witnesses.",
          "The pilot operated over water without having a life jacket on board, contrary to Civil Aviation Rules. Not wearing a life jacket reduced his chances of survival.",

          "The non-performance of the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) in guiding search and rescue to the accident site in a timely manner, which in survivable accidents could mean the difference between survival and not.",
          "Being a dedicated log carrier, the risk of death by entering closed cargo holds containing logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency response training programme, yet no evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed.",
          "when pilots do not inform their flight-following organisations of changes to their routes or destinations, any search and rescue action that is required could be delayed or misdirected",
          "There were as few as 4 approved lifejackets on board the Easy Rider to be shared among 9 people, which not only contravened Maritime Rules but significantly reduced the chances of persons not wearing lifejackets surviving in the water after the vessel capsized.",
          "Although not a factor in this incident, the use of similar titles for different RNAV approach procedures to the same runway is a hazard that could result in an aircraft flying the wrong approach.",
          "The Easy Rider's manually operated emergency position indicating radio beacon had probably not been intentionally activated and was still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the vessel sank.",
          "The crashworthiness of the ELT, which was designed to alert and guide emergency services to a crash site, was inadequate.",
          "a vessel certified to carry up to 90 passengers and operating up to 12 nm from the coast very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed.",
          "The rescue response from the vessel's master and crew was not well coordinated or practised, taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and attempt resuscitation. Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue attempt would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to survive, which would have been achievable if the entry into enclosed spaces procedure had been followed in the first place.",
          "Maritime rules that specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels are based only on how far the vessels are permitted to travel from the coast. The rules do not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on exposed coastlines, where higher-specification lifejackets would be more appropriate.",

          "Lack of a suitable communication system between the train driver and train manager is a serious safety issue raised previously in a Commission report on an incident that occurred in 2006 and the subject of an existing open safety recommendation.",
          "Nor could the system rely on visually sighting whether the mobility hoist was in use, as this case demonstrated - it had only just been deployed when the train departed 71 seconds after having stopped at the station platform. Under similar conditions, it would have been difficult for the train manager to see the mobility hoist even if it had been deployed onto the platform.",
          "The reliance on train drivers to observe and respond to signals as the primary control to prevent collisions, given known and foreseeable risks such as distraction and incapacitation, has the potential to be ineffective.",
          "The operation of the mobility hoist relied on the train manager knowing and/or remembering the stations at which any passengers in wheelchairs were to alight, then having good communication with the train attendant to ensure that the operation was complete and the train secure before giving \"right away\" clearance to the driver.",
          "The standard of non-technical skills (NTS), formerly known as Crew Resource Management, between the driver, the TXO and the signaller were ineffective.",
          "The examples given in this report that show the results of using colloquial language, non-standard phraseology and inadequate crew resource management lend weight to the Commission's previous recommendation that the rail industry adopt a national communication standard with which all rail participants must comply.",
          "The safety issue arising from this incident was the misunderstanding between the train controller and the driver during the recovery sequence, which resulted in a potential head-on collision with another train.",
          "A train travelling between stations with the passenger doors open and no passenger crew on board can be a serious safety issue.",
          "There was no defence in the system to prevent an accident if a train driver did not react correctly to signals and route indicators.",
          "Relying on mobile telephones for critical communications had its limitations, such as reception not being guaranteed in tunnels, and train drivers not being issued with company mobile phones, limiting a train crew's ability to manage effectively an emergency on board their own train.",
          "the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the limit for the setback authority, or of the method for protecting the movement.",
          "There will be a residual risk that in the event of some emergency situations, train managers might not be able to access the fixed portable radios.",
          "Opportunities for improving situational awareness and understanding through better use of non-technical skills were missed, increasing the likelihood of the incident.",
          "Miscommunication between the train driver and the train controller resulted in each having a different understanding of how the train would be recovered to its correct route.",
          "the training in place for the crew around the configuration of the emergency stops likely resulted in confusion on which emergency stops serviced which system.",
          "the setback movement was not planned and carried out in accordance with the operating rules and procedures.",
          "Poor communication and specifically a lack of adequate crew resource management contributed to all 4 of these incidents.",
          "Mobile phone use has proven to be a major distractor in other rail, air and marine accidents that the Commission has investigated. The danger has also been recognised and dealt with by recent changes in road legislation preventing the use of mobile phones while driving road vehicles.",
          "The signaller was likely to have been distracted by other tasks that had been assigned to her, which is likely to have contributed to her momentarily losing sight of the train controller's plan to cross trains at Papakura.",
          "The miscommunication between the driver and the train controller arose from a casual and ambiguous conversation at a time when a set of clear and precise instructions should have been issued.",
          "Bridge team members later said that closed loop communication was not always used, especially in routine manoeuvres. This was one explanation for why it was used for one helm order and not the next.",
          "The use of an administrative control measure was not effective on its own, and the adoption of engineering control measures when establishing PWAs would provide an enhanced level of protection for track workers.",
          "Once the train manager and assistant train manager were left on the platform, they had no radio by which they could make immediate contact with the trainee to stop the train.",
          "There was a potential for drivers of metro passenger trains to be distracted by non-operational interactions with other train staff.",
          "Implementation of an administrative control measure designed to provide protection for a track worker was unsuccessful due to the poor use of non-technical skills.",
          "Non-technical skills, particularly in communication, possessing a common mental model, challenge and response, and situational awareness, were not effectively employed, contributing to the incident.",
          "The main safety issue arising from this incident was that procedurally there was a disconnect between the operation of the mobility hoist from the luggage van at the rear of the train and the train manager's pre-departure checks near the front of the train: the stowing of the mobility hoist and securing of the luggage van doors did not feature in the train manager's pre-departure checks; there was no means provided for the train attendant in the luggage van to communicate with the train manager near the front of the train; the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system.",
          "The radio communication between the train controller and the train driver was open loop, and after it had ended neither party really understood the other's intentions.",

          "Indications that the right-hand engine was not performing well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system. However, even if they had been it is unlikely that any subsequent action would have prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.",
          "Had the pilots known that the nose landing gear was not down and locked and then tried the alternate extension procedure, that action would have been unlikely to succeed because debris would probably still have been blocking the restrictor within the hydraulic actuator.",
          "The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position. If they had asked the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing gear, it is likely that they would have taken further action in an attempt to get the nose landing gear locked down.",

          "Although much aircraft maintenance is done under supervision, the requirement for a duplicate check after maintenance is limited to a few defined control systems. The landing gear is not one of those systems, but an undetected maintenance error in the landing gear system has the potential to cause a serious incident or accident.",
          "The false green light on the verification system misled the pilots of ZK-NEB into believing that the nose landing gear was fully down and locked.",

          "The damage to the seals within the extend/retract hydraulic actuator could have initially been caused by a manufacturing defect in the seals or by an incorrect assembly technique. The damage may have been exacerbated by debris in the hydraulic fluid that originated from excessive wear in another actuator in the system, the one that opened and closed the forward nose landing gear doors.",
          "The isolated nature of the component failure in this occurrence, and the actions the manufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to the relevant maintenance procedures were not warranted.",

However, that action was not recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.",

In this case the next train coming from the opposite direction arrived at about the same time that the derailment occurred. In other circumstances a delay in train control becoming aware of such an event in double-track territory is a lost opportunity to warn other trains in the vicinity. The delay can be overcome by fitting an improved radio system with selcall capability to the Wellington commuter rail fleet.",

When the line was upgraded to bidirectional, the eight-metre separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not identified as a potential issue.",

          "Most of the passenger trains in the Wellington commuter fleet are not equipped with selcall-capable radio equipment, which means that in the event of an emergency brake application or other event that causes a rapid reduction in air brake pipe pressure, there could be a critical delay in train control being alerted in time to prevent the event escalating.",
          "The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed. His failure to do so was the final act that contributed to the incident.",

          "The lack of fail-safe backup systems, such as automatic train brakes activation in case of SPADs (signals passed at danger), for all signals in the Wellington Station approaches, particularly signal 100 which was overrun by the Melling service, increases the risk of collisions.",
          "The operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform at Melling Station and colliding with the stop block had not been adequately considered. No special speed restriction for the approach had been set; the stop block was an older and less effective design than its modern equivalent; and the pole carrying the overhead traction power line was placed directly behind the stop block where it was prone to damage.",
          "The amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance operation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less likely to have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the work gang; and it added an additional step using another means of communication.

The complexity of the relationship between New Zealand and international standards for crewing ships is an issue that New Zealand needs to resolve.",

          "The skipper did not have the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if he did, he did not apply it wisely when loading the Easy Rider for the trip. The Easy Rider being overloaded, with the average distribution of weight being too high, was the prime factor leading to its capsize.",

This scenario should be included in emergency response training and drills, and passenger ferries from all companies operating in the same area should be designed to minimise the risks of such an operation.",
