# What is this folder about?

This folder is intended as a place for local development work that is worth versioning. There are some `admin_notebooks` that will be sued repeatedly but the rest are just my scratch pads. All of the final code is within the `viewer` and `engine` modules.

# Git ignore epxlaination

As by default all of the files are ignored you need to add a local gitignore file to every folder if you want to include stuff. This explicit signalling is designed to help make you think about what you actauly want to keep.
