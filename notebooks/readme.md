# What is this folder about?

This folder is intended as a place for local development work that is worth versioning.

My workflow involves doing a bit of work inside jupyter notebooks. These notebooks I keep clean enough and do important enough thigns that I believe they shoudl be trapped.

If you are working locally and dont want to track and "backup" what you are oding then I recommend just putting them in your workbench folder.

# Git ignore epxlaination

As by default all of the files are ignored you need to add a local gitignore file to every folder if you want to include stuff. This explicit signalling is designed to help make you think about what you actauly want to keep.
