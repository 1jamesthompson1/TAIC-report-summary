       "CompleteThemeSummary: [[\"<h4>Communication Breakdown</h4>Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it highlights the lack of effective communication between the train controller, the driver, and the onboard service manager (OSM). The train controller did not communicate with the driver after the train was wrong routed, which led to the passengers disembarking without proper oversight or protection (\"the train controller did not attempt to contact the driver of train 804 after the train passed 12R signal\" (3.24)). Additionally, the driver did not include the OSM in the decision-making process for passenger disembarkation, which could have provided alternative safe options (\"the OSM was left out of the communication and decision-making process\" (3.22)). This lack of communication increased the risk to passengers and could have been mitigated with effective communication protocols.<br><h4>Inadequate Situational Awareness</h4>Inadequate situational awareness is another safety theme relevant to this accident. The driver's partial view of the signal and subsequent actions based on incomplete information led to the wrong routing of the train (\"the driver only observed a proceed signal on the bottom unit and acted on it in the expectation that the route was correctly set for the passenger train\" (3.13)). Furthermore, the train controller's distraction with other tasks prevented them from setting the correct route for the passenger train (\"the train controller had become distracted with other train controlling tasks\" (4.1)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates how a lack of full awareness of the operational environment can lead to unsafe conditions.<br><h4>Non-Technical Skills Deficiency</h4>Non-technical skills deficiency is a safety theme that played a significant role in this accident. Despite the personnel involved having undergone training in non-technical skills, the incident showed that these skills were not effectively utilized (\"the incident highlighted the dangers that can still occur when non-technical skills are not used, or not used effectively\" (3.33)). The failure to confirm the full signal indication and to communicate effectively among the crew members are examples of this deficiency. The theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of non-technical skills such as communication, decision-making, and situational awareness in ensuring safe rail operations.<br><h4>Procedural Non-Compliance</h4>Procedural non-compliance is a safety theme that emerges from this accident due to the absence of a rule stipulating that passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at Rolleston and the lack of instructions for actions to take if a passenger train is berthed on the West Main Line (\"there was no rule that stipulated passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at Rolleston\" (4.3)). The driver's decision to disembark passengers without consulting train control or the OSM also reflects a deviation from expected safety procedures. This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for clear and enforced procedures to guide the actions of train crews in non-standard situations.<br><h4>Inadequate Risk Assessment</h4>Inadequate risk assessment is a safety theme relevant to this accident, as evidenced by the driver's decision to allow passengers to disembark onto the ballast and cross the track without a comprehensive safety evaluation involving all responsible parties (\"The driver made no attempt to contact train control after becoming aware that the train had been wrong routed\" (3.20)). The driver's unilateral risk assessment did not consider the broader operational context that train control could have provided. This theme is relevant because it shows the importance of thorough risk assessments that include input from all relevant parties to ensure passenger safety.<br><h4>Insufficient Training Emphasis on Safety Principles</h4>Insufficient training emphasis on safety principles is a safety theme identified in this accident. Although all personnel involved had been trained in non-technical skills, the incident demonstrated that these principles were not at the forefront of their actions during the event (\"This incident highlighted the importance of ensuring that the principles remain prominent in workers' minds as an important tool in planning for any safe-working scenario\" (3.38)). The theme is relevant as it suggests that ongoing reinforcement and application of safety training are necessary to ensure that safety principles are consistently applied in practice.<br>\",\"<h4>Wheel-bearing Failures</h4>Wheel-bearing failures are a critical safety theme as they can lead to derailments. In this accident, the \"evidence points clearly to a wheel-bearing failure resulting in a 'screwed' axle journal and the consequential dropping of the bogie side frame onto the rail\" (4.1.4). The failure of the wheel-bearing was the direct cause of the derailment (5.1), and the report discusses the processes in place to mitigate the risks of such failures (4.1.5). The wheel-bearing that failed had been in use for approximately seven years and had traveled 330,000 kilometers before failing (4.3.6), indicating that the longevity and usage of wheel-bearings are factors that need to be monitored to ensure safety.<br><h4>Inadequate Monitoring Systems</h4>The accident highlighted the inadequacy of the RailBAM system in place at the time to detect and prevent wheel-bearing failures. The RailBAM system \"had the potential to have detected the pending failure of the wheel-bearing and trigger the removal of the wagon from service before the bearing failed\" (5.4), but it was not fully implemented or adequately resourced to achieve this outcome. Prior to the derailment, the Te Puna RailBAM had generated 20 fault records for the failed wheelset, but no action was taken to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). This indicates that the monitoring systems in place were not effective in preventing the accident, making it a significant safety theme.<br><h4>Brake System Issues</h4>Problems with the braking system are a safety theme as they can lead to wheel and wheel-bearing damage, which in turn can cause derailments. The report suggests that \"problems with the wagon's braking systems leading to an unusually high number of fused brake block events led to wheel and wheel-bearing damage\" (5.2). The derailed wagon had a high incidence of brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure (4.1.6), and the frequency of unscheduled work on the wagon's brake system in 2013 was surprising, given that it was not placed on a \"watch list\" or removed from service (4.3.10). This indicates that issues with the brake system were a contributing factor to the accident and represent a broader safety concern.<br><h4>Inspection and Maintenance Practices</h4>Inspection and maintenance practices are a safety theme because inadequate practices can fail to detect impending failures. The scheduled inspections of the derailed wagon had been carried out at the required frequency, but neither the pre-departure inspection nor the roll-by inspection detected any signs of the impending bearing failure (4.3.3, 4.3.4). The report also notes that the visual inspection regime is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure (4.3.13). This suggests that the inspection and maintenance practices in place at the time of the accident were insufficient to detect and prevent the wheel-bearing failure that led to the derailment.<br><h4>Risk Management and Response</h4>Risk management and response is a safety theme because the lack of appropriate action in response to identified risks can lead to accidents. Despite the RailBAM system generating multiple fault records for the failed wheelset, KiwiRail did not take action to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). Additionally, there was no dedicated RailBAM analyst position or agreed process for monitoring and reviewing RailBAM data at the time of the derailment (4.4.12). This indicates that the risk management and response to the identified bearing faults were inadequate, which is a significant safety theme related to this accident.<br><h4>Organizational Oversight</h4>Organizational oversight is a safety theme as it encompasses the broader systemic issues that can lead to accidents. The report indicates that KiwiRail had not addressed the issue of high brake block replacement frequency with an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule (4.1.6), and there was no \"watch list\" or removal from service despite the frequency of unscheduled brake system work (4.3.10). Furthermore, the lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst and an agreed RailBAM process (4.4.12) points to organizational shortcomings in addressing safety risks. This theme is relevant as it reflects on the organizational practices and decision-making processes that failed to prevent the accident.<br>\",\"<h4>Compliance with Track Warrant Conditions</h4>Compliance with track warrant conditions is a critical safety theme in this accident. The track warrant control method of protection relies on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions (\"Safety issue: The track warrant control method of protection was reliant on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions\" (3.6)). In this incident, the track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed the specified location before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track, leading to the collision (\"The track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed Limeworks Road public level crossing before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track and in the path of the approaching train\" (4.4)).<br><h4>Effective Use of Crew Resource Management</h4>Effective use of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles is another safety theme related to this accident. The train controller did not apply CRM principles effectively by not providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road (\"When issuing the track warrant to the track ganger, the train controller did not apply Crew Resource Management principles by providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road\" (4.3)). This lack of communication contributed to the track ganger's incorrect assumption about the train's location and subsequent unsafe actions.<br><h4>Verification of Train Movements</h4>Verification of train movements before authorizing track occupancy is a crucial safety theme. The track warrant system requires that certain conditions be met before a warrant becomes valid, such as verifying the passage of another train. In this case, the track ganger overlooked the requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the specified mark before the track warrant became valid (\"The requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the 429 km mark before the track warrant became valid was overlooked entirely\" (3.21)). This oversight directly led to the hi-rail vehicle being on the track at the time of the collision.<br><h4>Adherence to Operating Rules and Procedures</h4>Adherence to operating rules and procedures is a safety theme that was not followed, contributing to the accident. The train controller issued the track warrant in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures, but the track ganger failed to adhere to these rules by not ensuring the departing train had cleared the area (\"The train controller issued a track warrant to the track ganger conditional on the departure of Train 932 from Limeworks Road, in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures\" (4.2)). This non-adherence to procedures resulted in the hi-rail vehicle being in the path of the oncoming train.<br><h4>Decision-Making in Emergency Situations</h4>Decision-making in emergency situations is a safety theme that played a role in the severity of the accident. The train driver chose to apply full-service braking instead of emergency braking, which would have reduced the train's speed more rapidly and possibly lessened the severity of the impact (\"The train driver decided to make a full-service brake application rather than apply the emergency brakes, and as a result the train struck the hi-rail vehicle at a higher speed and took longer to stop than it would have had the emergency brake been applied\" (4.5)). The driver's decision-making in this emergency situation affected the outcome of the accident.<br><h4>Technological Defenses Against Human Error</h4>The lack of technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The track warrant control system relies on compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms, and the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses (\"however, the track warrant control system is reliant on the level of compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms and read back to train controllers. the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error\" (3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This reliance on human compliance without technological backup increases the risk of accidents due to human error, as seen in this incident.<br>\",\"<h4>Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control</h4>Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control is a safety theme that involves the helicopter's main rotor blades diverging from their normal plane of rotation, leading to a loss of control and potential in-flight break-up. This theme is relevant to the accident as the evidence indicated that \"the main rotor blades had flapped up and down to the limit stops and the blades had flexed beyond their normal flexible range, causing permanent creases on the upper and lower surfaces\" and \"both main rotor blades had struck and separated the tail boom\" (4.2.27). The report also states that \"the cause of the in-flight break-up was main rotor blade divergence caused by a possible combination of the following factors: the helicopter entering low-gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of turbulence), turbulence, excessive movements of the cyclic control, low main rotor blade RPM\" (5.2).<br><h4>Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters</h4>Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters is a safety theme that involves the lack of sufficient guidance and mandatory requirements from the regulatory body to minimize the risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report identifies that \"The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations\" (5.5). The report also highlights differences in regulatory approaches between the FAA and CAA, particularly after 1998, which may have influenced the accident rates in the respective countries (4.3.18).<br><h4>Flight manual clarity and terminology</h4>Flight manual clarity and terminology is a safety theme that concerns the way critical safety information is presented in the flight manual, including the use of terms like \"Warning\" and \"Caution.\" This theme is relevant to the accident as the report finds that \"The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and situations that could result in serious injury or death\" (5.6). The report also notes that the flight manual's \"Limitations\" section did not mention any airspeed limit for the helicopter in turbulent and windy conditions, which is a critical safety aspect given the R22's susceptibility to in-flight break-ups in such conditions (4.3.36).<br><h4>Turbulence and wind conditions</h4>Turbulence and wind conditions is a safety theme that involves the impact of atmospheric conditions on helicopter flight, particularly for light helicopters like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter was flying in conditions of \"strong wind and moderate to extreme turbulence\" at the time it broke up in flight (5.1). The report also mentions that \"turbulence was likely to have been one of the main factors contributing to the in-flight break-up\" (4.2.15).<br><h4>ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices</h4>ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices is a safety theme that involves the reliability of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) during crashes and the use of flight tracking devices to locate downed aircraft. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter's ELT activated but was severely damaged and unable to transmit a usable location signal (4.4.3). The report also acknowledges the common concern of ELT failures after crashes and the potential benefits of flight tracking devices, which in this case, guided search aircraft to the general location of the crash (4.4.4, 4.4.11).<br><h4>Pilot experience and training</h4>Pilot experience and training is a safety theme that involves the level of knowledge and skill pilots have, particularly when flying helicopters with known handling characteristics and limitations like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report suggests that \"The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence\" (5.4). The report also highlights the diversity in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and the theory behind the Robinson safety awareness training (4.3.25).<br>\",\"<h4>Human Error in Manual Route Setting</h4>Human error in manual route setting is a significant safety theme as it directly contributed to the wrong-routing of the train. The report states that \"the train controller was qualified to control any of the Auckland control zones and was familiar with multitasking between the zones and across several computer screens,\" yet he made a mistake in setting the route manually due to the increased risk of human error during the morning peak train control workload (4.2.1, 4.2.2). This theme is relevant because the train controllers were in a transition period, becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line and were required to set routes manually, which increased the risk of error (5.1, 5.2).<br><h4>Misinterpretation of Signals by Train Driver</h4>Misinterpretation of signals by the train driver is another safety theme. The driver, despite being qualified and familiar with the route, failed to recognize that the signal was indicating a wrong route for his train. The report notes that \"the driver assumed that the route ahead had been correctly set for his train\" and \"selectively read the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803 but did not recognize that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train\" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risk associated with drivers making assumptions about their routes and the importance of correctly interpreting signals to prevent accidents.<br><h4>Inadequate Communication During Recovery</h4>Inadequate communication during the recovery process is a critical safety theme. The report identifies a safety issue where \"the radio communication between the train controller and the train driver was open loop,\" leading to a situation where \"neither party really understood the other's intentions\" (4.4). This miscommunication resulted in the train being driven back towards Puhinui Station without the required protection from other train movements, creating a potential head-on collision with another passenger train (5.4, 5.5). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that clear and precise instructions were not issued at a critical moment, which could have averted the violation of rail operating rules (5.6).<br><h4>Lack of Automatic Route Setting</h4>The lack of automatic route setting is a safety theme that underpins the incident. At the time of the incident, \"train controllers had to set routes manually because the construction works at Wiri Junction were still in progress\" (4.2.2). The report indicates that KiwiRail planned to provide automatic route setting within the train control system, which would have reduced the likelihood of a wrong-route being set (4.2.8). This theme is relevant as the manual setting of routes was a temporary measure until the completion of track layout changes, and the subsequent commissioning of automatic route setting has since reduced the risk of such incidents.<br><h4>Training and Familiarity with Safety Procedures</h4>Training and familiarity with safety procedures is a safety theme that emerges from the driver's actions during the incident. The driver had been trained in the use of the SWA-01 procedure required for setting back a train, but had not used one in his two years of driving. The report suggests that \"he should have been familiar enough with the rules to realise that what he was about to do required a SWA-01 procedure to be completed before setting his train back\" (4.4.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of not only training but also the practical application and familiarity with safety procedures to ensure they are followed correctly in real-world situations.<br><h4>Crew Resource Management and Standardized Communication</h4>Crew resource management and standardized communication is a safety theme that is highlighted by the report's findings on the need for clear communication and the use of all available resources to ensure safe operations. The report discusses the concept of crew resource management, where \"rail participants make use of all the resources available to ensure they all work with consistent information to ensure a successful execution of the plan/task\" (4.4.6). The relevance of this theme is demonstrated by the incident, which serves as an example of the need for improvement in the way some rail participants are communicating, particularly during non-routine operations (4.4.8).<br>\"]]\n",
