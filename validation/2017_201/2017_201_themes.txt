Poor bridge management
There was not enough communication between the navigational officer and the master. The crew suggested they were reluctant to speak up to the master. AS a result the navigational officer was not on the same page as the master about what the vessel was supposed to be doing.

Improper use of ECDIS
The use of a Electronic Chart Display and Information System would have helped prevent the grounding. It was not being used as the ships primary form of navigation as intended. This was due to lack of training and understanding about the abilities and limits of the ECDIS.

Lack of Expertise in the Department of Conservation
The Department of Conservation did not have the expertise to manage the Marine operations in the sub Antarctic islands. As they have the same powers of handing out permits as a harbour master it is recommended that they have the same level of training.
