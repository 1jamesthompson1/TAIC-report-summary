Poor watchkeeping
During the fishing operations no one was watchkeeping. This was because the skipper assumed everyone else would keep out of there way. The 2 deckhands were not trained in proper watchkeeping making it difficult to cary out fishing operations while having proper watch and fatigue management.

Improper Fatigue management
There was little procedure set in place for making sure that fatigue was properly managed. Most of the responsibility of fatigue management fell to the shoulders of the skipper who was the most susceptible to it.

Misunderstanding in the COLREGS give way rules
Both teh Kota Lembah and the F.V. Commission thought that the other vessel was going to give way to them. Technically speaking it was the F.V. Commission who had the right of way as it was a fishing vessel under operation. However the Kota Lembah thought it has the right of way simply due to its size.
