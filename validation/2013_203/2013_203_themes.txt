Improper procedures when working with a critical system.
The fitting of the new propellers was likely sub optimal. This is because of many failures in the fitting process. Namely that the responsibility of a correct fit was not held by either Kiwirail or DMV. This meant that there was no one to ensure that hte experts advice was followed when working with critical systems.

Improper standards
The ISO standard 481/1 for tolerance levels is outdated. This is due to modern high efficiency propeller operate much closer to the cavitation limit. Therefore the tolerance levels aught to be decreased to ensure that a given propeller can operate at its maximum efficiency.

Lack of documentation
There was no documentation of the fitting process. This means that there is no way to know if the propellers were fitted properly. This is a major issue as the propellers are a critical system. This documentation contributes to the lack of responsibility for the fitting process.
