Poor alarms
The bilge alarms in this vessel were considered nuisance alarms as the visual indicators would be on alot of time during normal operations. Furthermore there were no extra alarms to alert the crew that the fish hold has reached an unsafe level of water. The lack of alarm for the fish hold was against Maritime regulations


Non latched hatches
The latches into the fish hold were not securable as it was just operated by a hydraulic system. This meant that a failure in the hydraulic system could cause the hatch to open and let water in.

Improper escape routes
The routes did not properly allow the crew to escape to open deck. Importantly the wheelhouse has no direct access to the open deck. It is likely that the escape routes did not meet the intent of the Maritime Rules for providing escapes. As a result all of the crew died in the sinking.
