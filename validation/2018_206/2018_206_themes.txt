Bridge resource management did not meet the industry good practice
There was no agreed specific pilot plan. This meant that even though the bridge team was asked to challenge the pilots actions they were not aware of what the pilot was doing.

Lack of ECDIS
The ship operated off paper charts which were good. However using modern technology like ECDIS would of helped increase the bridge teams situation awareness, thus reducing chance of hitting known hazards. The ship was due to be fitted with ECDIS in the near future.

Equipment failure
Once it was decided to use the anchor to slow the ship down the port and starboard anchor both did not deploy as expected. This meant that neither the starboard or port anchor was available to help slow the ship down.
