- name: Flight Path and Glider Positioning
  explanation: The choice of flight path over Mount Tauhara and the execution of the flight path were significant contributing factors to the accident. The glider's position relative to the mountain, at a very low altitude and downwind of the trig station, reduced the options available to the instructor and increased the risk of an accident occurring. "The significant contributing factor to the accident was the choice of flight path over Mount Tauhara and the execution of it" (3.37). Additionally, flying just downwind of the ridge face in the poor lift zone exposed the glider to disturbed airflow and possibly turbulence, which very likely contributed to the glider's impact with the terrain (3.21).
- name: Airworthiness and Maintenance
  explanation: The airworthiness of the glider was a safety theme, as it was very likely that the glider was airworthy on the day of the accident flight and immediately before its impact with the mountain (3.10). However, the aircraft logbook showed that all checks and maintenance had been completed as required when due, except for the avionics inspection, which had expired the day before the accident (3.8). Although the overdue avionics inspection would not have affected the safety of the flight, it is still relevant to consider maintenance and airworthiness as a safety theme in aviation accidents.
- name: Weight and Balance
  explanation: The weight and balance of the glider were within acceptable limits at the time of the accident, which is a critical safety theme in aviation to ensure the aircraft operates within its certified weight and balance limits. "The glider weight and balance were very likely within the acceptable weight and balance limits at the time of the accident" (3.12). Proper weight and balance are essential for the safe operation of any aircraft, including gliders.
- name: Pilot Medical Fitness
  explanation: Medical fitness of the pilot is a safety theme, as the instructor had a current medical certificate to operate as both a gliding instructor and a tow pilot. The autopsy report found evidence of hypertensive disease, but there was no evidence to suggest pilot incapacitation (3.13). "It is very unlikely that medical factors contributed to this accident" (3.14). Ensuring the medical fitness of pilots is crucial for safe flight operations.
- name: Instructor Training and Competency
  explanation: Instructor training and competency were identified as safety issues, as the club did not ensure that Gliding New Zealand (GNZ) instructor training procedures were fully implemented, and GNZ audits did not detect this discrepancy. "The standard set by GNZ for instructor training and their continued competency was not followed by the club" (4.6). The accident instructor did not have a current competency review and had not flown with someone authorized to carry out a competency review in the 24 months prior to the accident (3.45). This theme is relevant because the instructor's ability to safely conduct the two trial flights over the mountain was in question due to the lack of formal training and verification of competency (3.36).
- name: Situational Awareness and Speed Control
  explanation: Situational awareness and speed control are safety themes, as pilots must maintain awareness of their relative positions over ridges and be alert to areas of high risk. The instructor on the first flight allowed the glider's airspeed to drop below the club's minimum safe speed near the ridge (3.27). "regardless, if an instructor's situational awareness is compromised, either by their not perceiving subtle cues that the margins are reducing, or by their not fully comprehending how the glider's current position would affect its future dynamics, recovery from the situation would become increasingly difficult" (3.23 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The ability to control airspeed and maintain situational awareness is critical for avoiding accidents, especially when flying near terrain.
