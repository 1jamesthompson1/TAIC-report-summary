","0.0","3.333","The instructor's potential lack of situational awareness and the decision to fly a path that increased the risk of an accident could be attributed to human error (3.23, 3.37). The instructor's assumptions about the flight path and the conditions may have contributed to the accident.
","2.887","30.0","The accident report highlights that the instructor had a current 'B' Category instructor rating and was qualified to conduct the trial flight, but there was no formal training or sign-off to verify competency for soaring on Mount Tauhara (3.36). Additionally, the club had limited systems to ensure instructors could verify pilots' competency levels for ridge soaring on Mount Tauhara, which increased the risk of an accident (3.31, 3.33). The lack of a current competency review for the instructor also contributed to the accident (3.45).
","0.0","1.667","The report does not indicate that a lack of training or familiarity with the glider's equipment contributed to the accident.

","0.0","5.0","The club's practices had diverged from the requirements of GNZ, and there was no adequate system in place for instructors to verify pilots' competency levels for ridge soaring on Mount Tauhara (3.33). The club's non-compliant operations and the ineffective GNZ audit procedure in detecting these discrepancies contributed to the accident (3.46, 3.48).

","2.887","10.0","The Commission could not determine why the trial flights were conducted over Mount Tauhara, but the flight path as conducted increased the risk of an accident occurring (3.17). The instructor's decision to fly just downwind of the ridge face in the poor lift zone with very low height above the mountain top reduced the margin to maneuver the glider away from the mountain (3.21).
","0.0","8.333","The club's practices had diverged from the requirements of GNZ, and GNZ's audit procedure was ineffective in detecting the club's non-compliant operations or in taking action to correct them (3.42-3.45, 3.48). The instructor did not have a current competency review, which was a requirement not met, and had not flown with someone authorized to carry out a competency review in the 24 months prior to the accident (3.45).
","2.887","25.0","The report indicates that the instructor's situational awareness may have been compromised, either by not perceiving cues that safety margins were reducing or by not fully comprehending how the glider's position would affect its future dynamics (3.23). The choice of flight path over Mount Tauhara and the execution of it, with the glider's position relative to the mountain at a very low altitude and downwind of the trig station, reduced the options available to the instructor and increased the risk of an accident (3.37).
