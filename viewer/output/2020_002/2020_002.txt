No repeat  accidents - ever!  
"The principal purpose of the Commission shall be to determine the circumstances and 
causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future, 
rather than to ascribe blame to any person."  
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
 
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity and 
standing commission of inquiry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents that occur in New Zealand or involve New Zealand -registered aircr aft or 
vessels.  
Our investigations are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve safety.  Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue criminal, civil, or regulatory action.  
At the end of every inquiry, we share all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve safety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The C ommission 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive  summary  
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1 On 31 May 2020, a n instructor  from the Taupo Gliding Club  conducted a trial flight  
with a short -term member (the student ). The flight was the second of the day for the 
instructor , who had previously flown a similar trial flight with another short -term 
member . 
1.2 The instructor  flew over the Mount Tauhara walking track near the southeastern face of 
the mountain. The glider was  observed by witnesses walking the track  from  near the 
trig station  on the summit . The glide r was last seen flying past the trig  station  at about 
the same height  as the trig  station , but on the downwind side  and with the left wing 
down . The witnesses saw and heard t he glider's left wing strike scrub  and, as it 
subsequently went out of their sight , they heard further sounds of impact . Neither  
occupant survived the  accident . 
Why it happened  
1.3 The Transport Accident Investigation  Commission found that the glider impacted 
terrain while the instructor  was likely  attempting to escape from a situation where the 
glider  was at a low height above the mountain and downwind of the ridge face. 
Despite the instructor's efforts to manoeuvre  the glider away from rising terrain on the 
right -hand side, a collision with the terrain became unavoidable.  
1.4 The Commission found that the Taupo Gliding Club  had limited systems in place to 
positively verify that pilots had an appropriate level of competency to soar on Mount 
Tauhara . 
1.5 The Commission also found that the Taupo Gliding Club  procedures for instructor 
training and ongoing competency were not in accordance  with Gliding New Zealand 's 
Manual of Approved Procedures .  
1.6 The Commission made two safety recommendations : 
• One to the Taupo Gliding Club  to develop a system to ensure local instructors 
are able to positively verify that pilots have appropriate level s of competency 
to ridge soar on Mount Tauhara and safely conduct training flights on the 
ridge .  
• One to Gliding New Zealand to review how gliding club instructors are trained 
and clubs are audited, and then take corrective action to ensure that all new 
instructors are consistently trained to the standards set out in the Manual of 
Approved Procedures .  
What we can learn  
1.7 Ridge soaring has inherent risks due to factors such as turbulent wind conditions, 
unpredictable updrafts and  proximity to terrain , and pilots must be competent in the 
correct techniques in order to manage these risks.

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 1.8 Trial flights should be conducted in environment s that meet the intent of the flight s 
without introducing unnecessary risk s. 
Who may benefit  
1.9 Gliding clubs, glider pilots , instructors and personnel involved with glider flying 
activities and aviation regulation within New Zealand will benefit from this report.

Pārongo pono  
Narrative  
2.1 At 141 6 on 31 May 2020 ,1 an ASK21 G lider, registered ZK -GTG (the glider), owned and 
operated by the Taupo Gliding Club  (the club) , departed from the Centennial Park 
aerodrome  for a 'trial flight ', the second one that day. This type of flight is used by 
gliding clubs to introduce potential new members to the sport. On board was an 
instructor (the instructor ) and a member of the public who had joined the club  as a 
short -term  member  for a trial flight (the student2). 
2.2 The glider was aerotowed3 to an altitude of  5000 feet  above mean sea level (amsl) , a 
launch height  of about 3500 feet above the ground level , and released from the tow 
plane over the northern region  of the Taup ō township. Sometime a fter the release, the 
instructor  flew south to the south eastern  face of Mount Tauhara  (see Figure 8 for an 
orientation of the mountain) . 
2.3 Some walkers on the mountain track  reported that they observed the glider  flying 
above the south eastern face of Mount  Tauhara  near to points on the ground locally 
 
1 All times in this report are New Zealand Standard Time (NZ ST). 
2 The report uses the term 'student' to label the person in the front seat of the glider involved in this accident. 
Gliding New Zealand Advisory Circular 1 -04 Trial Flights refers to them as a student who is a short -term member 
of a club. That person is defined as a 'crew membe r' under the C ivil Aviation Rules (CARs) . The report's use of the 
term 'student' should not be confused with a 'student pilot' under the CARs, its being a role not applicable here.

(Base picture from Google Earth Pro)  

 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 known as Rocky Point and The Trig. Some of these witnesses reported later that they 
saw the glider fly in a northerly direction to the west of the trig station at the 
mountain 's peak and then descend and impact with terrain just below  the trig station  
(see Figure 3). Timing from various sources confirm ed that the accident occurred at 
about 1433.   
2.4 Emergency services were called and some people on the mountain went to assist . 
Neither  the instructor  nor the student  survived the accident .  
2.5 The accident flight was the second trial flight that day  with the same instructor . The 
first flight had taken off at 1338 and landed at 1408. The student  in the first flight had 
taken photogra phs and video during that flight.  
2.6 The normal plan for trial flights at Taupō  was an aerotow launch to 5000 f eet amsl  
followed by a flight of 20-30 minutes ' duration . They were  intended to  provide 
student s with an opportunity to take the controls and get used to the experience of 
flying in a glider.  
Personnel  information  
2.7 The instructor  had started learn ing to fly  gliders in England in 1975 , then stopped in 
1979  with about 63 hours ' total experience , which included some cross -country  flights.  
They had recommenced training 35 years later , in New Zealand in 2014 . They  had had 
the option of having their past gliding experience  recognised4 but had chose n to 
restart training as a trainee glider pilot in New Zealand  under  the current training 
scheme  with a new logbook . This would take them through  the A and B certificates  to 
being a qualified glider pilot . 
2.8 The instructor  had been  predominantly living in the Northern H emisphere , but had 
recently been following the global summer  with residence s in both hemisphere s. From 
2014 they had travel led between New Zealand , England  and France , flying  gliders in all 
three countries  and using their New Zealand logboo k to record their flight time s. They 
were  a member of the club and flew at Centennial Park  when in New Zealand.   
2.9 The instructor  had a New Zealand medical certificate  type DL95, which was current to 
November 2020 . They  had gained a New Zealand Qualified Glider Pilot certificate in 
March 201 5 and a passenger rating in December 2016 . In 20 17 they had completed a 
'Silver ' badge award6 in France  with the cross -country  distance leg . 
2.10 The instructor  had started training to be  an instructor with the club towards the end of 
2015  and had gained a 'C' Category instructor rating on 20 February 2018. They had 
been upgraded to a 'B' Category instructor  rating  by the club 's instructor trainer  on 8 
March 2019  and their gliding Biennial Flight Review (BFR) was current at the time of the 
accident  (see Table 1 below).  
2.11 The instructor  had also learnt to fly powered aircraft from 1989 and had contin ued to 
fly these , gainin g a private pilot licence (PPL)  and a glider towing rating valid in France 
 
4 The total gliding time shown in Table 1 includes experience recorded in England . It is the corrected amount after 
reconciling a double entry  by the pilot.

Aircraft information  
2.12 The glider was a two -seater  Alexander Sc hleicher  GmbH and Co . ASK 21 . It was 
manufactured in November 2009. The club purchased the aircraft new and registered it 
with the Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  (CAA)  as ZK -GTG.   
2.13 The glider was issued with a Certificate of Airworthiness  by the CAA on 12 January 
2010. Its last maintenance  inspection  was performed on 5 January 2020 . It had 
accumulated 3027 flight hours as recorded in the logbook on 21 March 2020 . 
2.14 The last Annual  Review  of Airworthiness was issued on 23 October 2019. All 
maintenance on the glider was current , but the 24 -month Avionics (and Instrument) 
Inspection7 was due on the day before  the accident and had not been conducted . 
2.15 All the applicable Airworthiness Directives and Service Bulletins were found 
incorporated or complied with at the time of the accident  date. 
2.16 The glider had a current weight and balance certificate  with an empty weight of 392.9 
kilograms  (kg), and a minimum cockpit weight of 75 kg was permitted in the front seat . 
The glider's flight manual stated a maximum of 110 kg was permitted in each seat. 
2.17 The glider had a maximum take-off weight of 600 kg. The cockpit loading must  not 
exceed the aircraft take -off weight limit and it must be distributed to maintain aircraft 
balance  within the range of acceptable movement for the centre of gravity , from 234 
millimetres  (mm) aft of datum for the heaviest load back to 469 mm aft of datum8 for 
the lightest load.  
2.18 The glider was fitted with a mechanical variometer system with an indicator in the front 
cockpit instrument panel. An elect ric variometer with audio  was also installed  with 
display s in the front and back cockpits . When switched on, t he audio  emitted a tone 
that change d in pitch , depending  on whether the glider was experiencing lift or si nk9 
conditions . This allowed the pilot to focus their attention outside while soaring and to 
see and avoid other gliders in thermals . It was controlled from the front -seat position  
where the student  was seated . The audio was selected off for the two trial flights.  
2.19 It is standard practice  for gliders in New Zealand to carry dail y inspection book s. They 
are used to meet the Civil Aviation Rule ( CAR) requirement10 for a technical log  to be 
 
7 This inspection included an altitude encoder and an air traffic control (ATC) transponder unit used to show the 
glider's position and altitude to the ATC when in controlled airspace.  
8 The datum point for the ASK 21 is at the leading edge of the wing.  
9 Sink is the opposite of lift. It is air flowing downwards towards the ground.

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 carried in an aeroplane for pre-flight plan ning. The daily insp ection book for this 
aircraft was usually stowed in a side pocket in the rear cockpit , but was not found  with 
the wreckage  or at the club pre mises.  
Meteorological  information  
2.20 The MetService forecast for the area on the afternoon of 31 May 2020 was nil 
significant cloud or wind with a 30 k ilometre  visibility. The forecast wind for Central 
Plateau at 3000  feet was 070  degrees (°) true11 at 15 knots ( kt) and at 5000 f eet it was 
060° true at 10 kt. The observed  cloud formation consisted of high cirrus cloud cover 
and a lower layer of scattered cumulous clouds, with a local cloud base height of 
around 4800 feet.  
2.21 The automatic weather station at Taupō  aerodrome recorded the wind at 1530 on that 
day as being 110 ° true at 13 kt. 
2.22 The wind at the club site, from photo graph s of the windsock , was approximately 
aligned with Runway 07 at about 15 kt, which is from 090° true. 
2.23 The wind strength and direction at Mount Tauhara on the day was estimated from : 
witness reports  and; the crabbing12 angle as observed in the first student's GoPro 
video, that the glider flew to maintain track over the ridge.  The estimated wind  
strength was 12-16 kt from about  120° true.  
Communic ations and aids to navigation  
2.24 The glider was fitted with a single , very-high-frequency  transmitter/receiver radio . It 
had multi ple channels and was selected to the Centennial Park aerodrome  frequency . 
2.25 The glider was fitted with an altitude encoder and transponder , but was not required to 
have an emergency locator t ransmitter  and none was fitted.  
Aerodrome information  
2.26 The club operate s from the Centennial Park aerodrome located north of Mount 
Tauhara  and east of Taupō . It is an unattended and non-certified  aerodrome at an 
approximate elevation  of 1500  feet amsl. The aerodrome has a  grass strip with two 
vectors . On the day of the accident , gliders were taking off on Runway  04 with a slight 
crosswind from the right and  landing directly into wind on  Runway  07.  
Recorded data  
2.27 No flight track information was available  for the accident flight.   
2.28 Video  of the first tr ial flight was obtained  from the first student 's GoPro . It was possible 
that the student  in the accident flight took photos or video s on their cell phone , but no 
data could be recovered from it.

 Site and wreckage information  
2.29 The glider's flight path immediately before impact , as confirmed by witness  reports and 
ground impact scars, was at a height that was about level with the trig station and 
slightly to the west. The glider was seen heading in a northerly direction ( see Figure 3). 
Along the glider's flight path , the ground level dropped away to a crater valley . That 
valley ended at a saddle at the edge of the mountain .  
2.30 The wreckage was located on Mount Tauhara approximately 110 metres north and 60 
metres below  the trig station ( see Figure 4). The first part of the glider to impact the 
terrain was the left wing  tip (see Figure 5). It cut a clearly defined left-hand , curved slice 
through the scrub and bush canopy  (the red curved line in  Figure 4). The glider 
fuselage impacted later during the accident sequence  (near the arrowhead in Figure 4) 
in an almost vertical nose -down attitude .

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 2.31 The glider continued to slide through the bush , with the right wing leading and the 
fuselage near vertical until the right wing  lodged in a tree trunk . The fuselage fell back 
slightly , twisting the right wing . The tail section broke off just aft of the wings  as the 
glider came to rest in the bush  (see Figure 6). 
Ridge soaring  
2.32 Ridge soaring is a technique glider pilots use to gain altitude  from a wind flow that has 
been deflected upwards when it  flows over hills . If the glider can remain flying in the 
rising air it may gain altitude . When the wind  is flowing perpendi cularly to the h ill or 
ridge line , the glider can be flown  along the ridge and the pilot can convert height gain 
to forward speed  and distance  (see Figure 7).  
Figure 6: Wreckage and impact path (red arrow) - top of photo is north  
 
 
Final Report AO-2020 -002 |  
<< Page 9 >>
  
 
2.33 A glider pilot needs to maintain a forward airspeed so the y fly along the face of a ridge 
then turn and travel back the other way  (in beats  or regular strokes) . The flight path 
loosely follows a figure -eight shape , with all turns away from th e ridge and out into the 
wind. The lift is strongest slightly upwind of the ridge face , as shown in Figure 7. 
2.34 The pilot  will crab slightly  (fly sideways)  into wind  along each beat to maintain a 
position relative to the ridge face and the lift. If the glider's air speed is allowed to drop , 
the glider will drift downwind.  Drifting downwind of a ridge could mean that the pilot 
no longer has  the height available to convert to airspeed in order to fly back into wind 
to the area of lift. The wind speed over the ridge top may also increase near the 
ground due to the venturi  effect,13 making an into-wind flight path more difficult from 
close to the ridge top.

Circular  (AC) 2-13 Mountain & Ridge Soaring Safety Principles14. Summarised k ey

• safe speed : Always maintain a safe speed near the ground . (GNZ promote d at 
least three methods for calculating a safe speed,  and they all ensure d a safe 
margin was maintained above stall speed)  
• turn away : Always make the first turn away from the ridge  
• escape route : Always have an escape route planned that leads to lower terrain 
immediately, with  a safe landing area

Soaring the  ridges on Mount Tauhara  
2.36 Whichever direction the wind blows at Taupō , it may be possible to soar on one of the 
ridge  faces  of Mount Tauhara  when the wind strength gets above about 12 kt. Unlike  a 
traditional ridge as shown in Figure 7, Mount Tauhara  is approximately conical . The 
conical shape presents an obstacle to the wind , which then follows the path of least 
resistance  over or around it . That could be left or right rather than up and over  the top , 
and consequently ridge lift at Mount Tauhara can be confined to narrow ba nds 
(sometimes  called fingers ) and be associated with turbulence.  
2.37 Mount Tauhara has four main faces that can be soared ( see Figure 8): the north face 
near the club's base, the southwestern face near the township, the eastern face near a 
quarry , and the southeastern or back ridge on the opposite side of the mountain from 
the base. Some faces produce stronger lift than others a nd some are shorter in length. 
If the wind changes ( in either direction or strength) the lift may also increase or reduce 
or shift to a different face.  
2.38 The wind was from the southeast on the day of the accident , as shown with the blue 
arrow  in Figure 8. The approximate glider flight path on the ridge runs , as determined 
from the video of the first flight , is shown as a red double -pointed line.

 Medical and pathol ogical  information  
2.39 The instructor 's medical history did not contain anything of significance  to the 
accident .  
2.40 The pathologist's  autopsy report showed nothing remarkable  with the instructor . It 
identified the presence of hyper tensive disease . There was no evidence of recreational 
drugs or alcohol  use. 
2.41 The autopsy report for the student  found no evidence of recreational drugs or alcohol 
use. 
Organisational information  
2.42 Gliding operations in New Zealand must be  conducted in accordance with CAR Part 
104. This sets out the minimum require ments  for gliding activities and operations , and 
any exemptions for gliding activit ies otherwise required  by other rule parts.   
2.43 GNZ is the aviation recreational  organisation certified under CAR Part 149  to oversee  
gliding operations in New Zealand . Part 149  sets out the requirement for the 
organisation to have  a management structure and a documentation system  to ensure 
that gliding operations are conducted in a safe manner . GNZ's exposition describes  
how the organisation is to be managed  to achieve the objective of CAR Part 149. Key 
documentation is the GNZ Manual of Approved Procedures (MOAP)15 and GNZ's  ACs.16 
2.44 Most glider pilots in New Zealand are members of gliding club s under the umbrella of 
GNZ. The GNZ President and National Operations Officer (NOO) issue glider pilot 
certificates and glider instructor ratings17 under delegation from the Director of Civil 
Aviation New Zealand . 
2.45 A gliding club must become affiliated to GNZ if it wishes to operate under GNZ's Part 
149 certificate. Club members must operate in accordance with GNZ's MOAP . Affiliated 
clubs have  their own sets of rules and operating procedures  that require  their 
members to comply  with the GNZ MOAP . GNZ audit s affiliated member clubs to 
ensure compliance with GNZ procedures and provide s Regional Operations Officers 
(ROO s) to interact with the clubs on a regular basis.  The club was an affiliated member 
of GNZ.  
2.46 Gliding is a recreational sport . All positions of responsibility  within GNZ and individual 
gliding clubs  are held by volunteers .  
2.47 The CAA audits GNZ , and also samples affiliated clubs , to ensure GNZ operations are 
compliant  with CAR Part 149.   
2.48 Commercial  glider operations18 are only permitted to take passenger flights under CAR 
Part 115 . Under this rule part, a certificated operator must use glider pilots who hold 
commercial glider pilot licence s (CPL(G) s) to take commercial glider flights . At the  time 
of the accident  there were  no commercial glider operations active in New Zealand.  
 
15 Current at the time of the accident , MOAP AL32, effec tive date: 22 October 2019.  
16 The GNZ Advisory Circulars provide advice to affiliates on how to comply with the requirements of the MOAP. 
They may also provide information of a more general nature.  
17 Pilot certificates and ratings are issued by GNZ , whereas licences are issued by the CAA ( see Glossary) . 
18 A commercial glider operation is  a flight for the ca rriage of passengers or goods for hire or reward.  
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 2.49 CARs  also provide for both private and commercial glider pilot licences  to be issued 
directly by the CAA. These types of licence  require each pilot to have completed a 
specific training sy llabus and then tested by an independent organisation contracted 
to the CAA to conduct flight examinations . A CPL(G) is required before a pilot can take 
passengers or goods for hire or reward . It requires the pilot to have a Class 1 CAA 
medical. Alternatively,  a glider pilot may apply for a private  pilot glider licence PPL(G) , 
under which they are only require d to have  a Class 2 CAA medical.   
2.50 In June 2023  the CAA database showed that there were 13 people in New Zealand with 
CPL(G) licence s19 and 1 5 people with PPL (G) licence s.20  
Trial flights  
2.51 Trial flights assist  gliding clubs to attract new members  by providing them with a 
means to conduct introductory  instructional  flight s with member s of the public . Trial 
flights are conducted under GNZ A C 1-04 Trial Flights. The AC states  that "overt 
advertising of glider  flights as  'joy rides ' or 'scenic ' is not appropriate".    
2.52 Trial flights must be conducted  for a legitimate or 'bonafide'  reason , with the express 
intention of attracting new members  to a club. The Transport Accident In vestigation 
Commission (Commission) analysed  glider launch trends from a sample survey of New 
Zealand clubs to understand more about the use of trial flight  activity . The results of 
the survey were inconclusive. The data  indicated a relatively low conversion rate of 
short -term  club members to full club members ; however , the reason s for this could not 
be interpreted in any meaningful way.   
2.53 GNZ statistics showed that in 2020 there were approximately 11,6 00 reported glider 
launches in New Zealand. Of those launches , approximately 7000  (60 per cent ) were 
club dual and solo launches and approximately 1 100 (10 per cent ) were trial flights. The 
remaining launches were private -owner -related flights - 3500 (30 per cent ) (see 
Appendix 3 ). 
 
 
19 Of which only three held current Class  1 CAA medical s to allow them to operate  in that capacity . 
20 Of which only four held current Class  2 CAA medical s to allow them to operate in that capacity.

 3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1 This accident occurred during what should have been an uneventful  trial flight 
intended  to introduce a student  to a new experience of flying in a glider . The flight  was 
conducted at an altitude  and distance from the aerodrome that would have ensured  
enough height over the general terrain to allow for an uneventful  glide back to the 
aerodrome . The glider was seen flying above the walking track on Mount Tauhara and 
then later as it flew past the trig  station  immediately before it impacted the mountain . 
The accident  site was approximately  2000 feet above the aerodrome and easily within 
gliding distance at 4 kilometres away .  
3.2 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event to identify 
those factors  that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the 
severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues  that have the potential to 
adversely affect future operations.  
What happened  
3.3 The glider departed  from the club's base for the second trial flight of the day  at about 
1416.   
3.4 At about 1435 , witnesses saw the glider fly past the trig  station at about the same 
height as the trig  station  (see Figure 3). It had approached from  Rocky Point and was to 
the west of the ridge that ran between the trig  station  and Rocky Point . It was heading 
in a northerly direction. Several witnesses recalled that the left -hand wing was much 
lower than the right  as it passed the trig station , and those  at the trig station recalled 
the glider being very low and close to them  as it flew past .  
3.5 The glider then impacted the mountain  in a left-wing -down attitude, soon after 
passing the trig stat ion.  
Avenues of inquiry  
3.6 The Commission considered several potential contributing factors for the glider 's 
impacting the mountain . These  are discussed below.  
Airworthiness  
3.7 The glider was reportedly airworthy when it departed from the aerodrome . The daily 
inspection book was not found with the wreckage or at the club premises. Based on 
the damage to the glider cockpit area, it is very likely  that the book fell out during the 
accident sequence and was lost at the accident sit e. Without the daily inspection book , 
the Commission  was unable to verify that the daily pre -flight  inspection had been 
completed. The club manager reported seeing the accident instructor conduct the daily 
pre-flight inspection,  so it was very likely  that it had been completed and signed.   
3.8 The aircraft logbook showed that all checks and maintenance had been completed  as 
required  when due , except for the avionics  inspection , which had expired  the day 
 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 before . The overdue avionics inspection would not have affect ed the safety of the 
flight.  
3.9 The first trial flight of the day was rec orded on video by the student on  board that 
flight , and it showed that the glider was operating normally. The front seat's  
mechanical variometer had been working but became stuck on maximum lift  at some 
point  during the first flight , then subsequently released while the glider was on the 
landing roll . The instructor  had turn ed on the electric variometer without the audio and 
the student's video showed that it was working.  Neither of the variomet ers was 
essential for the flight.  
3.10 It is therefore very likely  that the glider was airworthy  on the day  of the accident flight  
and immediately before its impact with the mountain .  
Weight and balance  
3.11 A glider must be  operated within its certified weight and balance limits. Based on the 
instructor 's and the student 's weights recorded by the pathologist, and the absence of 
the club ballast weights normally placed under the front seat  cushion , the glider 
weighed 572.9 kg on the accident flight. This was less than the maximum rated take -off 
mass , and the front -seat load was above the minimum limit . The  calculated centre of 
gravity for the accident flight was 344 mm aft of datum , which was within  the 
acceptable range of movement.  
3.12 Therefore, the glider weight and balance were very likely  within the acceptable weight 
and balance limits at the time of the accident.  
Medical  
3.13 The instructor  had a current medical certificate to operate as both a gliding instructor 
and a tow pilot. The autopsy report found evidence of hypertensive disease . The 
Commission's medical advisor reviewed the auto psy report  and the instructor 's medical 
records from the CAA, and discussed the instructor's records with the CAA's medi cal 
examiner . There was no evidence to suggest pilot incapacitation.  
3.14 It is very unlikely that medical factors contribute d to this accident.  
Flight path over Mount Tauhara  
3.15 A briefing  was conducted before the first trial flight ; it involv ed the club manager,  the 
tow pilot, the accident instructor (who was also the club duty instructor  that day) and 
another instructor. The club manag er's account of the briefing included discussing the 
runway -in-use and flying conditions . The conditions at Mount Tauhara were also 
discussed , with there being a 10 -12 kt wind over the east face. The club manager 
recalled stating , "It would be better to stay over the airfield at 5000 feet21, as the east 
face [Mount Tauhara ] could be a little rough ."  
3.16 Video evidence of the first trial flight shows the glider  flew over Mount Tauhara during 
the flight.  The instructor commented to the ground handler while on the ground 
between the two t rial flights , that the ridge was working .22 The second trial flight, the 
accident flight, was also fl own over Mount Tauhara.  
 
21 The Commission clarified the intent of this sta tement with the club manager to be that trial flight s should be 
conducted within the vicinity of the airfield.  
22 'Working ' in this context means the ridge was producing lift.  
 
Final Report AO-2020 -002 |  
<< Page 15 >>
 3.17 The Commission could not determine why the trial flight s were conducted over Mount 
Tauhara , but the flight path as conducted increased the risk of an accident occurring.   
Glider p ositioning  relative to the mountain  
3.18 When flying near to a ridge , the position of the glider relative to the slope is important. 
Pilots must be aware of the wind direction and where the lift is strongest and avoid 
getting downwind of the ridge face. The glider must maintain an appropriate 
component of into -wind speed near a ridge to maintain  a relative position over the 
ground. If this component reduces, the glider will drift downwind.  
 
 
Figure 9: Estimated ridge soaring beats for the first flight , from video  
(Base picture from Google Earth Pro)  
3.19 Pilots must maintain awareness of  gliders ' relative position s over ridge s, and alert to 
areas of high risk . If a pilot allows a glider to get too close to the ridge or drift 
downwind  of the crest , they need to respond promptly and have an escape route in 
mind that leads to lower ground.  
3.20 In the first flight, the instructor approached Mount Tauhara from the south over Rocky 
Point then flew north and to the left of the trig  station  with 50 -100 f eet clearance 
above the top of the mountain ( see Figure 9).

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 3.21 On the accident flight the instructor flew just downwind of the ridge face in the poor 
lift zone  (see Figure 3 and Figure 7). The glider's very low height above the mountain 
top reduced the instructor 's margin to manoeuvre the glider away from the mountain . 
Additionally, t he downwind position resulted in  the glider flying in the wind shadow23 
of the mountain , and being exposed to a more  disturbed airflow and possibly 
turbulence . These factors very likely  contributed to the glider 's impact with the terrain.  
3.22 It is unknown why the instructor allowed the glider to become positioned in such a way 
that no safe escape options remained  (see Figure 3) . The proximity of the glider to the 
terrain meant that any remaining margin of safety could very quickly reduce , 
particularly if the airspeed were allowed to decrease .  
3.23 Pilots can be distracted by a number of sources inside and outside the cockpit . 
Alternatively, the y may become overly focused on a particular task  to the detriment of 
a wider environmental scan.  Regardless, if an instructor's situational awareness24 is 
compromised, either by their not perceiving subtle cues that the margins are reducing, 
or by their not fully comprehending how the glider's current position would affect its 
future dynamics , recovery from the situation would become increasingly difficult.  
Speed control  
3.24 The general formula taught by the club instructors at the time for deciding on the 
minimum safe speed at which to fly near the ridge was : stall speed , plus 10 kt, plus ½ 
the wind speed .25 The glider's stall speed was estimated at 39 kt from the table on 

<< page 25 >>
 of the Flight Manual , using the calculated centre  of gravity  with the crew at 
the time .26 Therefore , with a wind speed of 15 kt, the minimum safe speed near the 
ridge would have been 56 kt. A more recent version of the formula used by the club in 
its training PowerPoint is: 1.5 x stall speed + ½ wind speed. The result for the ASK21 
Glider with this formula would have been 66 kt.  
3.25 While ridge flying and close to the ground, it is imperative for a glider pilot to 
constantly monitor and control airspeed.  A glider pilot becomes skilled at detecting 
instantaneous changes in airspeed by the feel of the controls and the sound of the air 
flowing past the canopy. The airspeed indicator will lag slightly.   
3.26 The Flight Manual27 describes the ASK21 Glider's low-speed flight and stall 
characteristic as benign. Aileron28 control is still effective down to minimum speed29 to 
maintain level wings , and normal rudder movement with up to 5 per cent yaw will not 
lead to a wing drop. A rapid pitch increase of 30  per cent to initiate a stall does not 
cause a wing to drop , but only a gentle drop of the nose. The sink rate will increase 
near the stall and the effects of turbulence and wind gusts are unpredictable.  A slow

24 Situational awareness relates to an individual's understanding of their surroundings. This includes their 
perception of data from their environment, comprehension of the meaning and significance of the situation, and 
projection to future states and events.

They are both important for low-speed flight.

 airspeed could therefore feel as if the controls were responsive,  but the glider would 
be quieter than normal and sinking more quickly than usual . The sink rate is shown on 
the variometer.  
3.27 On the first flight t he instructor  had maintained an airspeed of near to 50 kt while on 
the ridge , but had allowed it to reduce a few knots as the glider flew into rising air (lift). 
At one point , when the instructor had allowed the student  to take the controls, the 
glider's airspeed  had dropped  to 39 kt indicated (the estimated stall speed) as the 
student  approached Rocky Point  with an indicated altitude of 3600 f eet. A significant 
period of the first trial flight 's airspeed near the ridge  was at less than the club's 
minimum safe speed  of 56 kt as calculated above .  
3.28 There  was no data available for the accident flight , therefore the Commission could not 
determine if speed control of the glider was a contributing factor   
Control of gl ider 
3.29 During t he first trial flight of the day , the student  was offered the controls soon after 
release , and later they requested another go near the ridge. The instructor  agreed and 
allowed the student  to have limited control for a short period , then to follow the 
instructor 's movements.  
3.30 The Commission could not determine if the student or the instructor was in control of 
the glider at the time of the accide nt. 
Pilot competency associated with ridge soaring  
Safety Issue: The Taupo Gliding Club  had limited systems in place to ensure instructors could 
positively verify that pilots had appropriate level s of competency to ridge soar on Mount 
Tauhara and safely conduct training flights on the ridge. This increased the risk of an accident 
occurring.  
3.31 The instructor had a current 'B' Category instructor rating  and was qualified to conduct 
this trial flight. At the time the instructor completed their training  at Taupō , the GNZ 
syllabus comp rised  the basic manoeuvres and techniques required to fly a glider.  
Techni ques such as ridge soaring were part of the 'B' certificate training  and were only 
includ ed in a pilot 's training if the local terrain was suitable  for conduct ing such 
activities . Sign-offs for ridge soaring techniques could involve  just a classroom lesson 
and would be either noted in the pilot's logbook ( older -style logbook) or included in 
the Qualified Glider Pilot  check list . Advanced soaring training was generally self-
initiated , where a  pilot could seek specific experience at other clubs that had more 
suitable terrain  for their desired type of  soaring  training .  
3.32 Soaring in ridge lift at Mount Tauhara was part of initial flying training at Taupō  
whenever the opportunity arose . The club had some safety guidance written into its 
rules about flying around the mountain. The club records showed that formal training 
documents had once been used to train pilots in the  use of ridge lift on each of Mount 
Tauhara 's four faces . A model of the mountain was often used to demonstrate ridge 
soaring technique s to pilots during ground training sessions.  
3.33 Over time , and through members ' changing roles, ridge soar ing training became less 
formalised . At the time of this accident there was no adequate system  in place  for 
instructors to verify that pilot s had the appropriate level s of competency to ridge  soar 
on Mount Tauhara  apart from the standard check lists in logbooks and syllabus 
content sign -off for GNZ pilot achievement certificates .  
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO-2020 -002 Other factors   
3.34 The airbrakes were extended in the wreckage , as shown in Figure 6. These are typically 
operated by a pilot pulling the airbrake handle rearwards from the locked position. It is 
possible the instructor or student activated these . As the cockpit and all the control 
linkages were severely disrupted in the accident , the airbrakes were very likely  
extended by impact forces during the initial stages of the accident sequence.  
3.35 There was no evidence a bird strike had occurred.  
Conclusion  
3.36 The lack of any formal  training for club pilots to soar on Mount Tauhara , and a sign -off 
to verify that competency had been achieved, meant that the Commission was unable 
to determine the instructor's ability to safely conduct the two trial flights over the 
mountain.  
3.37 The significant contributing factor to the accident was the choice of flight path over 
Mount Tauhara and the execution of it. The glider 's position relative to the mountain, 
at a very low altitude  and downwind of the trig station, reduced the options available 
to the instructor, and increased the risk of an accident occurring.  
Other factors that affect safety  
Instructor training at Taupō  
Safety Issue : The Taupo Gliding Club  did not ensure GNZ instructor training procedures were 
fully implemented  and GNZ audits did not detect this discrepancy . This increased the risk that 
instructors were not fully competent  in all required areas .  
3.38 The club had a small and aging membership. It was run by a core group of volunteer 
enthusiasts , often supported by their families , and the club environment also provide d 
social  benefit s to its members . This is a typical situation in small gliding clubs in New 
Zealand , where a clubs ' survival may depend on a few stalwarts  willing to fulfil the key 
roles . The leading instructors in the club were in their 70s and the chief flying instructor 
(CFI) was planning to hand over the role to the accident instructor . 
Competency reviews  
3.39 To continue exercising their flying privileges, all glider pilots in New Zealand must 
undergo BFR s. The club management had recognised the risk s posed by its aging 
pilots , and changed the rules to require all pilots over age 70 to complete BFRs  
annual ly.30 
3.40 GNZ requires i nstructors to undergo competency review s at least every two years , to 
ensure that they are still competent to instruct and are familiar with current techniques. 
The MOAP allows instructors to use competency review s to also serve as their BFRs, 
but the reverse does not apply. The compe tency and BFR reviews are significantly 
different . The BFR is for pilots . It's a check  that a pilot is current and safe to fly solo by 
them demonstrating their basic flying skills to ensure their continued ability  to fly 
safely . The competency review is for instructor  pilots . It's a check that they are  
competent to instruct all flight training exercises by demonstrating their instructing 
 
30 Taupo Gliding Club  rules 5.11.1(i).  
 
Final Report AO-2020 -002 |  
<< Page 19 >>
 technique across the training syllabus . It also has a  provision to limit an instructor 's 
scope to instructing specific ex ercises.  
3.41 The competency review is further divided into two categories , each with its own form31: 
one for new and intermediate instructors , and the other for advanced and senior 
instructors . The MOAP gives clubs the freedom to reduce the period s between  
instructor competency reviews to mitigate the effects of aging. A club , for example, 
could place limitations on an instructor to allow them to perform only a limited part of 
their role.  
3.42 The club's practices had diverged from the requirements of GNZ . The CFI used  just the 
BFR form  to assess  the competency  of instructor  pilots because they considered it 
covered the same requirements  as the competency review. The CFI said they would 
conduct a BFR, then sometime later fill in the competency review form. The CFI might 
discuss with the pilot the exercises listed in the appropriate form. The club's instructor 
trainer believed that the CFI could request any instructor to submit to a competency 
review, but they were usually used in special situations (eg, to check overseas pilots or 
if there were  a particular concern with an instructor's competency).  
3.43 The club  tracked BFRs  with other pilot records to ensure that all club pilots remain ed 
current , but there was  no similar system for tracking a competency review where a 
pilot was also an instructor.  Competency reviews  were not conducted regularly  and 
were not tracked  to monitor their currency , and not all instructors had completed 
competency review s in their club file s.  
3.44 The MOAP32 requires a competency review to be carried out by the CFI , an instructor 
trainer , a ROO or the NOO . A glider pilot's logbook must be endorsed with a certificate 
to show appropriate currency and privileges  in accordance with their competency 
review . The accident instructor's logbook had not been endorsed with a competency 
review check. The instructor had not logged a glider flight with the club's instructor 
trainer between the start of 2018 and the accident in May 2020, and the CFI had never  
flown  with the instructor . The last check flight with a ROO  or NOO  had been on 21 
January 2018  for the  instructor's  'C' Category  instructor rating. The instructor had 
completed BFRs in New Zealand and instructors in France had conducted check flights 
with the instructor since 2018 , but these were not substitute s for a logbook 
endorsement or a competency review  in New Zealand . The instructor had completed a 
recent BFR , conducted by another of the club's 'B' Category instructor s, but this was 
not acceptable under  GNZ procedures to allow the instructor to continue to instruct.   
3.45 The MOAP  describes the requirement for an instructor to have a competency review 
less than two years old, and if not , that instructor is not considered current and not 
permitted to exercise the privileges of an instructor rating.  The instructor did not have 
a current competency review,  and had not  flown with someone who was authorised to 
carry out a competency review  in the 24 months prior to  the accident.  
GNZ audits

conduct gliding operations in New Zealand. The club is affiliated to GNZ and thereby

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 allowed to operate under  the GNZ Part 149 certificate. The rules for training and

3.47 A GNZ audit of the Taupō  club activities was conducted in 2013 , but the next one , due

a finding that GNZ had not audited three of the Central region clu bs for more than  10

GNZ had set for ensuring instructor competency in the MOAP and how the club 
conducted local instruction al processes. GNZ responded by stating that  these  audits 
were not exhaustive and only check ed a sample of the operation at a time. The 2018 
audit35 noted that there was "Good record keeping and accessibility of BFRs and 
instructor competency reviews" . Later in the comments , the auditor noted :  
"The club is an exemplar of best practi se in record keeping and in pro -active 
monitoring of its member s' flying currency ." 
3.49 The a uditors were the ROO or the NOO . Their time was mainly voluntary and there was 
no requirement in their described duties36 for them to have been trained in auditing 
techniques. A club audit  was usually conducted as part of a  single -day visit to the club 
and was combined with check flights with selected members  who were there at the 
time. The CFI at Taupō  advised that they had never been taken by the ROO for a check 
flight.

 4 Findings  
Ngā kiteng a 
 
4.1 While the instructor  was conducting a trial flight on the southeastern face of Mount 
Tauhara, i t is likely  the glider  lost height and drifted downwind  to a point where the 
instructor  was unable to track back into wind . It is likely  the instructor 's last option to 
avoid a subsequent collision with the terrain  was to fly towards lower ground located 
downwind of the trig  station . 
4.2 It is likely  that the instructor  bank ed to the left as they passed the trig station heading 
north, to avoid hitting the rising terrain near the trig  station . The left wing would have 
been in the lee37 of the hill , and it was likely  the pilot was unable to prevent the glider 
continuing  to roll towards a near-vertical  wing attitude . The subsequent contact made 
by the left-wing  tip with the scrub  initiated the glider 's full impact  with terrain.  
4.3 The trial flight path over Mount Tauhara increased the risk of an accident occurring.  
4.4 It is very likely  that the glider was airworthy at the time of the accident , and there was 
no evidence  that the accident was influenced by a medical issue  with the instructor  or 
the student , or an external event.  
4.5 At the time of this accident, the club  did not have an adequate system in place for 
instructors  to verify that pilots had the appropriate level s of competency to ridge soar 
on Mount Tauhara.  
4.6 The standard set by GNZ for instructor training and their continued competency was 
not followed by the club. GNZ 's audit procedure was ineffective in detecting the club's 
non-compliant operations or in taking action to correct them.

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They may not always relate 
to factors directly contributing to the accident or incident. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future transport safety.   
5.2 Safety i ssues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Safety issue s 
Pilot competency associated with ridge soaring  
Safety Issue : The Taupo Gliding Club  had limited systems in place  to ensure instructors could 
positively verify that pilots had appropriate level s of competency to ridge soar on Mount 
Tauhara  and safely  conduct training flights on the ridge. This increased the risk of an accident 
occurring.  
5.3 After this accident, the club developed a ridge soaring training PowerPoint 
presentation for  pilots .38 This was intended as part of a procedure to ensure pilots were 
more formally trained and approved to ridge soar on Mount Tauhara.  
5.4 In response to this accident and other recent ridge flying accidents, the GNZ 
Operations Team developed and issued a document in October 2022 titled , "Ten 
vicious traps in ridge and mountain flying".  The document was featured in the GNZ 
newsletter of November 2022  and is published on the GNZ website .  
5.5 The Commission welcomes this safety action. However, the Commission considers 
there is still a residual safety risk in the system that needs to be addressed. It relates to 
the club  instructors being able to positively verify that pilots can demonstrate an 
appropriate level of competency to ridge soar on Mount Tauhara. Therefore,  the 
Commission has made a recommendation  to address this issue.  
Instructor training  at Taupō  
Safety Issue : The Taupo Gliding Club  did not ensure GNZ instructor training procedures were 
fully implemented and GNZ audits did not detect this discrepancy . This increased the risk that 
instructors were not fully competent  in all required areas .  
5.6 In recent years, GNZ has develop ed a revised Pilot Training Programme  and a 
revised Instructor Training Programme  (ITP). The new Pilot Training Programme  was 
accepted by the CAA in June 2020 (just after this accident) and the ITP on 19 
October 2022.  GNZ began rolling out the ITP to all its affiliated clubs from  August 
2023 through  an initial series of two -day workshops.  
5.7 The Commission welcomes this safety action. However, the Commission considers 
there may still be a residual safety risk in the system until th ese revised  training 
 
38 Called 'Ridge soaring Mount Tauhara'.  
 
Final Report AO-2020 -002 |

 programmes have been implemented and the affiliated clubs audited to ensure 
compliance  with the GNZ standards .

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 6 Recommendations  
Ngā tūtohutanga  
General  
6.1 The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its  
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents .  
6.2 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendation s are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future .  
New recommendations   
6.3 On 27 September 2023  the Commission recommended that  the Taupo Gliding Club  
develop and implement a system approved by GNZ that ensures instructors can 
positively verify that pilots have an appropriate level of competency to ridge soar on 
Mount Tauhara and safely conduct training flights on the ridge . (010/23)  
6.4 On 5 October  2023 , the President  of the Taupo Gliding Club  responded in part :  
Regarding your letter asking for our intentions regarding the final 
recommendation. We have accepted and implemented your recommendation.  I 
will attach a photograph of our logbook entry supplied to those who have 
attended the compulsory Ridge Soaring Lecture, and also a photograph of the 
follow -up safety briefings which also cover soaring on Mt. Tauhara . 
 
6.5 On 27 September 2023  the Commission recommended that  Gliding New Zealand 
review how gliding club instructors are trained,  and clubs are audited , and then take 
corrective action to ensure that all new instructors are consistently trained to the 
standards set  out in the Manual of Approved Procedures  (MOAP)  (011/23) 
6.6 On 13 October 2023, the President of GNZ responded to recommendation (011/23) . 
Their  response addressed two parts of the recommendation separately. The first part of 
their response related to Gliding New Zealand review how gliding club instructors are 
trained:  
Gliding New Zealand is pleased to report that this recommendation was 
accepted  and implemented. More than just review how gliding club instructors 
are trained  GNZ undertook a comprehensive update and rewrite of the 
instructor training  programme (ITP) and submitted this to the CAA for 
acceptance on 1st June 2021. A  further period of extensive collaboration and 
engagement with the CAA was then  undertaken before final acceptance of the 
updated ITP was received from the CAA  on 19th October 2022. A summary of 
this fully reviewed and updated programme can  be found at the link below.  
https://gliding.co.nz/wp -content/uploads/2023/02/ITP -Summary.pdf  
Since acceptance, a GNZ team led by the Operations Team has been rolling out 
the updated ITP to club instructors around the country via a series of seminars 
 
Final Report AO-2020 -002 |  
<< Page 25 >>
 to ensure  a consistent approach to training using the new system is being 
adopted.  
In addition,  it should be noted that there has also been a new publication on the  
traps of ridge flying, "10 Traps", which was written and issued as a direct 
response to  this accident. This document has been added to the Pilot Training 
Program to  sharpen awareness around the potential hazards of ridge flying and 
is available to  both pilots and instructors.  
6.7 The second part of the President of GNZ response related to how GNZ audits its 
affiliated clubs:  
Gliding New Zealand advises that this recommendation is Under Consideration.  
Club audits are currently conducted by GNZ Regional Operations Officers 
(ROO's)  following a templated format. ROO's are volunteers and club audits in 
their present  format can take an entire weekend for one club. Presently there 
are three ROO's  covering 19 clubs spread across the length of New Zealand. To 
extend these audits to  detect gaps in an instructor's knowledge would involve 
the systematic assessment of  every instructor by the auditor, which is simply not 
practical, hence the auditor does  rely on the club CFI to attest to each 
instructor's  knowledge, capability and to provide  evidence of competency via 
records of assessment, Form OPS 07 and Form OPS 09.   
To step up another level in auditing would require funding. GNZ notes that 
CASA in  Australia funds their recreational aviation organisations to carry out 
their duties,  recognising that by doing so they are saving CASA significant 
amounts of money in  comparison to what it would cost CASA to do this 
themselves. GNZ suggest that the  CAA instead of charging Part 149 recreational 
aviation organisations (which reduces  their budgets available for use on safety 
measures such as audits) CAA should follow  overseas be st practice and fund 
these organisations to carry out audits and thus  improve safety.

Ngā akoranga matua  
 
7.1 Ridge soaring has inherent risks due to factors such as turbulent wind conditions, 
unpredictable updrafts and proximity to terrain , and pilots must be competent in the 
correct techniques to manage these risks.  
7.2 Trial flights  should be conducted in environment s that meet the intent of the flight s 
without introducing unnecessary  risks.

 Final Report AO-2020 -002 9 Conduct of the inquiry  
He tikanga rapunga  
 
9.1 On 31 May 2020  the CAA notified the Commission of the occurrence . The Commission 
subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an Investigator -in-Charge.  
9.2 On 31 May 2020 a Commission Protection Order (Number 002/01 2020 ) was issued for 
seven  days to protect  all areas of Mount Tauhara  within 40 metre s of any wreckage of 
ZK-GTG.  
9.3 In June 2020 two Commission investigators examined the wreckage site , gathered 
evidence  and recovered the wreckage . They also interviewed witness es and gathered  
video footage taken on the accident day . The investigators interviewed people at the 
club and gathered records.  
9.4 On 1 July 2020  a Commission Protection Order (Number 002/02 2020 ) was issued for 
the s eizure  of an Apple iPhone 11  that was found at the wreckage site . 
9.5 In December  2020 the Commission investigators interviewed more people at the club 
and people from GNZ. 
9.6 The Commissioners were briefed on the analysis progress in February 2021. That led to 
a survey of sample glider clubs about trial flights  and to the engagement of an external 
gliding consultant to support the Commissioners in their deliberations . 
9.7 The Commission considered further lines of inquiry and conducted further analysis in 
the following months .  
9.8 On 23 August 2022 the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to  seven 
interested persons for their comment.  
9.9 The Commission received seven responses  and seven submissions . All submissions 
were  considered , and changes made in response to those submissions were  included 
in the draft final report  presented in May 2023 . 
9.10 The Commission requested further changes  and sought new evidence to check 
comments from submi tters. The report  was further  revised and considered in  the June 
2023 meeting.  This was approved for circulation to two interested parties for their 
comment.  
9.11 The Commission received two responses and one submission . The submission was 
considered , and changes made in response to that submission were included in a 
second draft final report presented in September 2023.  
9.12 On 27 September  2023 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ng āti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai mārama' (i te ara 
haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pur suit of understanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwe lling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe' or 'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent s the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā hau e wh ā - the four winds  
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 'long 
white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a  'Aviation '.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for ' Maritime .  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
