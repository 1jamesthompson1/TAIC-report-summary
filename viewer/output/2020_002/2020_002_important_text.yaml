  \ accident occurred during what should have been an uneventful  trial flight \n\
  intended  to introduce a student  to a new experience of flying in a glider . The\
  \ flight  was \nconducted at an altitude  and distance from the aerodrome that would\
  \ have ensured  \nenough height over the general terrain to allow for an uneventful\
  \  glide back to the \naerodrome . The glider was seen flying above the walking\
  \ track on Mount Tauhara and \nthen later as it flew past the trig  station  immediately\
  \ before it impacted the mountain . \nThe accident  site was approximately  2000\
  \ feet above the aerodrome and easily within \ngliding distance at 4 kilometres\
  \ away .  \n3.2 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the\
  \ event to identify \nthose factors  that increased the likelihood of the event\
  \ occurring or increased the \nseverity of its outcome. It also examines any safety\
  \ issues  that have the potential to \nadversely affect future operations.  \nWhat\
  \ happened  \n3.3 The glider departed  from the club's base for the second trial\
  \ flight of the day  at about \n1416.   \n3.4 At about 1435 , witnesses saw the\
  \ glider fly past the trig  station at about the same \nheight as the trig  station\
  \  (see Figure 3). It had approached from  Rocky Point and was to \nthe west of\
  \ the ridge that ran between the trig  station  and Rocky Point . It was heading\
  \ \nin a northerly direction. Several witnesses recalled that the left -hand wing\
  \ was much \nlower than the right  as it passed the trig station , and those  at\
  \ the trig station recalled \nthe glider being very low and close to them  as it\
  \ flew past .  \n3.5 The glider then impacted the mountain  in a left-wing -down\
  \ attitude, soon after \npassing the trig stat ion.  \nAvenues of inquiry  \n3.6\
  \ The Commission considered several potential contributing factors for the glider\
  \ 's \nimpacting the mountain . These  are discussed below.  \nAirworthiness  \n\
  3.7 The glider was reportedly airworthy when it departed from the aerodrome . The\
  \ daily \ninspection book was not found with the wreckage or at the club premises.\
  \ Based on \nthe damage to the glider cockpit area, it is very likely  that the\
  \ book fell out during the \naccident sequence and was lost at the accident sit\
  \ e. Without the daily inspection book , \nthe Commission  was unable to verify\
  \ that the daily pre -flight  inspection had been \ncompleted. The club manager\
  \ reported seeing the accident instructor conduct the daily \npre-flight inspection,\
  \  so it was very likely  that it had been completed and signed.   \n3.8 The aircraft\
  \ logbook showed that all checks and maintenance had been completed  as \nrequired\
  \  when due , except for the avionics  inspection , which had expired  the day \n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO-2020 -002 before . The overdue avionics inspection\
  \ would not have affect ed the safety of the \nflight.  \n3.9 The first trial flight\
  \ of the day was rec orded on video by the student on  board that \nflight , and\
  \ it showed that the glider was operating normally. The front seat's  \nmechanical\
  \ variometer had been working but became stuck on maximum lift  at some \npoint\
  \  during the first flight , then subsequently released while the glider was on\
  \ the \nlanding roll . The instructor  had turn ed on the electric variometer without\
  \ the audio and \nthe student's video showed that it was working.  Neither of the\
  \ variomet ers was \nessential for the flight.  \n3.10 It is therefore very likely\
  \  that the glider was airworthy  on the day  of the accident flight  \nand immediately\
  \ before its impact with the mountain .  \nWeight and balance  \n3.11 A glider must\
  \ be  operated within its certified weight and balance limits. Based on the \ninstructor\
  \ 's and the student 's weights recorded by the pathologist, and the absence of\
  \ \nthe club ballast weights normally placed under the front seat  cushion , the\
  \ glider \nweighed 572.9 kg on the accident flight. This was less than the maximum\
  \ rated take -off \nmass , and the front -seat load was above the minimum limit\
  \ . The  calculated centre of \ngravity for the accident flight was 344 mm aft of\
  \ datum , which was within  the \nacceptable range of movement.  \n3.12 Therefore,\
  \ the glider weight and balance were very likely  within the acceptable weight \n\
  and balance limits at the time of the accident.  \nMedical  \n3.13 The instructor\
  \  had a current medical certificate to operate as both a gliding instructor \n\
  and a tow pilot. The autopsy report found evidence of hypertensive disease . The\
  \ \nCommission's medical advisor reviewed the auto psy report  and the instructor\
  \ 's medical \nrecords from the CAA, and discussed the instructor's records with\
  \ the CAA's medi cal \nexaminer . There was no evidence to suggest pilot incapacitation.\
  \  \n3.14 It is very unlikely that medical factors contribute d to this accident.\
  \  \nFlight path over Mount Tauhara  \n3.15 A briefing  was conducted before the\
  \ first trial flight ; it involv ed the club manager,  the \ntow pilot, the accident\
  \ instructor (who was also the club duty instructor  that day) and \nanother instructor.\
  \ The club manag er's account of the briefing included discussing the \nrunway -in-use\
  \ and flying conditions . The conditions at Mount Tauhara were also \ndiscussed\
  \ , with there being a 10 -12 kt wind over the east face. The club manager \nrecalled\
  \ stating , \"It would be better to stay over the airfield at 5000 feet21, as the\
  \ east \nface [Mount Tauhara ] could be a little rough .\"  \n3.16 Video evidence\
  \ of the first trial flight shows the glider  flew over Mount Tauhara during \n\
  the flight.  The instructor commented to the ground handler while on the ground\
  \ \nbetween the two t rial flights , that the ridge was working .22 The second trial\
  \ flight, the \naccident flight, was also fl own over Mount Tauhara.  \n \n21 The\
  \ Commission clarified the intent of this sta tement with the club manager to be\
  \ that trial flight s should be \nconducted within the vicinity of the airfield.\
  \  \n22 'Working ' in this context means the ridge was producing lift.  \n \nFinal\
  \ Report AO-2020 -002 |  \n<< Page 15 >>\n 3.17 The Commission could not determine\
  \ why the trial flight s were conducted over Mount \nTauhara , but the flight path\
  \ as conducted increased the risk of an accident occurring.   \nGlider p ositioning\
  \  relative to the mountain  \n3.18 When flying near to a ridge , the position of\
  \ the glider relative to the slope is important. \nPilots must be aware of the wind\
  \ direction and where the lift is strongest and avoid \ngetting downwind of the\
  \ ridge face. The glider must maintain an appropriate \ncomponent of into -wind\
  \ speed near a ridge to maintain  a relative position over the \nground. If this\
  \ component reduces, the glider will drift downwind.  \n \n \nFigure 9: Estimated\
  \ ridge soaring beats for the first flight , from video  \n(Base picture from Google\
  \ Earth Pro)  \n3.19 Pilots must maintain awareness of  gliders ' relative position\
  \ s over ridge s, and alert to \nareas of high risk . If a pilot allows a glider\
  \ to get too close to the ridge or drift \ndownwind  of the crest , they need to\
  \ respond promptly and have an escape route in \nmind that leads to lower ground.\
  \  \n3.20 In the first flight, the instructor approached Mount Tauhara from the\
  \ south over Rocky \nPoint then flew north and to the left of the trig  station\
  \  with 50 -100 f eet clearance \nabove the top of the mountain ( see Figure 9).\

  \ Final Report AO-2020 -002 3.21 On the accident flight the instructor flew just\
  \ downwind of the ridge face in the poor \nlift zone  (see Figure 3 and Figure 7).\
  \ The glider's very low height above the mountain \ntop reduced the instructor 's\
  \ margin to manoeuvre the glider away from the mountain . \nAdditionally, t he downwind\
  \ position resulted in  the glider flying in the wind shadow23 \nof the mountain\
  \ , and being exposed to a more  disturbed airflow and possibly \nturbulence . These\
  \ factors very likely  contributed to the glider 's impact with the terrain.  \n\
  3.22 It is unknown why the instructor allowed the glider to become positioned in\
  \ such a way \nthat no safe escape options remained  (see Figure 3) . The proximity\
  \ of the glider to the \nterrain meant that any remaining margin of safety could\
  \ very quickly reduce , \nparticularly if the airspeed were allowed to decrease\
  \ .  \n3.23 Pilots can be distracted by a number of sources inside and outside the\
  \ cockpit . \nAlternatively, the y may become overly focused on a particular task\
  \  to the detriment of \na wider environmental scan.  Regardless, if an instructor's\
  \ situational awareness24 is \ncompromised, either by their not perceiving subtle\
  \ cues that the margins are reducing, \nor by their not fully comprehending how\
  \ the glider's current position would affect its \nfuture dynamics , recovery from\
  \ the situation would become increasingly difficult.  \nSpeed control  \n3.24 The\
  \ general formula taught by the club instructors at the time for deciding on the\
  \ \nminimum safe speed at which to fly near the ridge was : stall speed , plus 10\
  \ kt, plus \xBD \nthe wind speed .25 The glider's stall speed was estimated at 39\
  \ kt from the table on \n\n<< page 25 >>\n of the Flight Manual , using the calculated\
  \ centre  of gravity  with the crew at \nthe time .26 Therefore , with a wind speed\
  \ of 15 kt, the minimum safe speed near the \nridge would have been 56 kt. A more\
  \ recent version of the formula used by the club in \nits training PowerPoint is:\
  \ 1.5 x stall speed + \xBD wind speed. The result for the ASK21 \nGlider with this\
  \ formula would have been 66 kt.  \n3.25 While ridge flying and close to the ground,\
  \ it is imperative for a glider pilot to \nconstantly monitor and control airspeed.\
  \  A glider pilot becomes skilled at detecting \ninstantaneous changes in airspeed\
  \ by the feel of the controls and the sound of the air \nflowing past the canopy.\
  \ The airspeed indicator will lag slightly.   \n3.26 The Flight Manual27 describes\
  \ the ASK21 Glider's low-speed flight and stall \ncharacteristic as benign. Aileron28\
  \ control is still effective down to minimum speed29 to \nmaintain level wings ,\
  \ and normal rudder movement with up to 5 per cent yaw will not \nlead to a wing\
  \ drop. A rapid pitch increase of 30  per cent to initiate a stall does not \ncause\
  \ a wing to drop , but only a gentle drop of the nose. The sink rate will increase\
  \ \nnear the stall and the effects of turbulence and wind gusts are unpredictable.\
  \  A slow \n \n23 A space downwind of an obstacle where the wind flow is affected\
  \ by the obstacle.  \n24 Situational awareness relates to an individual's understanding\
  \ of their surroundings. This includes their \nperception of data from their environment,\
  \ comprehension of the meaning and significance of the situation, and \nprojection\
  \ to future states and events.  \n25 The GNZ Moodle  training system for 'Safe Speed\
  \ Near the Ground' (CAA audit of same , dated 2 June 2020).  \n26 This was calculated\
  \ to be 337 mm aft of datum.  \n27 Revision TN23, \n<< page 25 >>\n, section IV.6\
  \ . Low speed flight, wing dropping and spins.  \n28 A controllable hinged surface\
  \ on the trailing edge of a wing, used to roll an aircraft around the longitudinal\
  \ \naxis. \n29 In this sense, minimum speed refers to the speed being near the \
  \ minimum sink rate speed or to the stall speed.  \nThey are both important for\
  \ low-speed flight.  \n \nFinal Report AO-2020 -002 |  \n<< Page 17 >>\n airspeed\
  \ could therefore feel as if the controls were responsive,  but the glider would\
  \ \nbe quieter than normal and sinking more quickly than usual . The sink rate is\
  \ shown on \nthe variometer.  \n3.27 On the first flight t he instructor  had maintained\
  \ an airspeed of near to 50 kt while on \nthe ridge , but had allowed it to reduce\
  \ a few knots as the glider flew into rising air (lift). \nAt one point , when the\
  \ instructor had allowed the student  to take the controls, the \nglider's airspeed\
  \  had dropped  to 39 kt indicated (the estimated stall speed) as the \nstudent\
  \  approached Rocky Point  with an indicated altitude of 3600 f eet. A significant\
  \ \nperiod of the first trial flight 's airspeed near the ridge  was at less than\
  \ the club's \nminimum safe speed  of 56 kt as calculated above .  \n3.28 There\
  \  was no data available for the accident flight , therefore the Commission could\
  \ not \ndetermine if speed control of the glider was a contributing factor   \n\
  Control of gl ider \n3.29 During t he first trial flight of the day , the student\
  \  was offered the controls soon after \nrelease , and later they requested another\
  \ go near the ridge. The instructor  agreed and \nallowed the student  to have limited\
  \ control for a short period , then to follow the \ninstructor 's movements.  \n\
  3.30 The Commission could not determine if the student or the instructor was in\
  \ control of \nthe glider at the time of the accide nt. \nPilot competency associated\
  \ with ridge soaring  \nSafety Issue: The Taupo Gliding Club  had limited systems\
  \ in place to ensure instructors could \npositively verify that pilots had appropriate\
  \ level s of competency to ridge soar on Mount \nTauhara and safely conduct training\
  \ flights on the ridge. This increased the risk of an accident \noccurring.  \n\
  3.31 The instructor had a current 'B' Category instructor rating  and was qualified\
  \ to conduct \nthis trial flight. At the time the instructor completed their training\
  \  at Taup\u014D , the GNZ \nsyllabus comp rised  the basic manoeuvres and techniques\
  \ required to fly a glider.  \nTechni ques such as ridge soaring were part of the\
  \ 'B' certificate training  and were only \ninclud ed in a pilot 's training if\
  \ the local terrain was suitable  for conduct ing such \nactivities . Sign-offs\
  \ for ridge soaring techniques could involve  just a classroom lesson \nand would\
  \ be either noted in the pilot's logbook ( older -style logbook) or included in\
  \ \nthe Qualified Glider Pilot  check list . Advanced soaring training was generally\
  \ self-\ninitiated , where a  pilot could seek specific experience at other clubs\
  \ that had more \nsuitable terrain  for their desired type of  soaring  training\
  \ .  \n3.32 Soaring in ridge lift at Mount Tauhara was part of initial flying training\
  \ at Taup\u014D  \nwhenever the opportunity arose . The club had some safety guidance\
  \ written into its \nrules about flying around the mountain. The club records showed\
  \ that formal training \ndocuments had once been used to train pilots in the  use\
  \ of ridge lift on each of Mount \nTauhara 's four faces . A model of the mountain\
  \ was often used to demonstrate ridge \nsoaring technique s to pilots during ground\
  \ training sessions.  \n3.33 Over time , and through members ' changing roles, ridge\
  \ soar ing training became less \nformalised . At the time of this accident there\
  \ was no adequate system  in place  for \ninstructors to verify that pilot s had\
  \ the appropriate level s of competency to ridge  soar \non Mount Tauhara  apart\
  \ from the standard check lists in logbooks and syllabus \ncontent sign -off for\
  \ GNZ pilot achievement certificates .  \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO-2020\
  \ -002 Other factors   \n3.34 The airbrakes were extended in the wreckage , as shown\
  \ in Figure 6. These are typically \noperated by a pilot pulling the airbrake handle\
  \ rearwards from the locked position. It is \npossible the instructor or student\
  \ activated these . As the cockpit and all the control \nlinkages were severely\
  \ disrupted in the accident , the airbrakes were very likely  \nextended by impact\
  \ forces during the initial stages of the accident sequence.  \n3.35 There was no\
  \ evidence a bird strike had occurred.  \nConclusion  \n3.36 The lack of any formal\
  \  training for club pilots to soar on Mount Tauhara , and a sign -off \nto verify\
  \ that competency had been achieved, meant that the Commission was unable \nto determine\
  \ the instructor's ability to safely conduct the two trial flights over the \nmountain.\
  \  \n3.37 The significant contributing factor to the accident was the choice of\
  \ flight path over \nMount Tauhara and the execution of it. The glider 's position\
  \ relative to the mountain, \nat a very low altitude  and downwind of the trig station,\
  \ reduced the options available \nto the instructor, and increased the risk of an\
  \ accident occurring.  \nOther factors that affect safety  \nInstructor training\
  \ at Taup\u014D  \nSafety Issue : The Taupo Gliding Club  did not ensure GNZ instructor\
  \ training procedures were \nfully implemented  and GNZ audits did not detect this\
  \ discrepancy . This increased the risk that \ninstructors were not fully competent\
  \  in all required areas .  \n3.38 The club had a small and aging membership. It\
  \ was run by a core group of volunteer \nenthusiasts , often supported by their\
  \ families , and the club environment also provide d \nsocial  benefit s to its\
  \ members . This is a typical situation in small gliding clubs in New \nZealand\
  \ , where a clubs ' survival may depend on a few stalwarts  willing to fulfil the\
  \ key \nroles . The leading instructors in the club were in their 70s and the chief\
  \ flying instructor \n(CFI) was planning to hand over the role to the accident instructor\
  \ . \nCompetency reviews  \n3.39 To continue exercising their flying privileges,\
  \ all glider pilots in New Zealand must \nundergo BFR s. The club management had\
  \ recognised the risk s posed by its aging \npilots , and changed the rules to require\
  \ all pilots over age 70 to complete BFRs  \nannual ly.30 \n3.40 GNZ requires i\
  \ nstructors to undergo competency review s at least every two years , to \nensure\
  \ that they are still competent to instruct and are familiar with current techniques.\
  \ \nThe MOAP allows instructors to use competency review s to also serve as their\
  \ BFRs, \nbut the reverse does not apply. The compe tency and BFR reviews are significantly\
  \ \ndifferent . The BFR is for pilots . It's a check  that a pilot is current and\
  \ safe to fly solo by \nthem demonstrating their basic flying skills to ensure their\
  \ continued ability  to fly \nsafely . The competency review is for instructor \
  \ pilots . It's a check that they are  \ncompetent to instruct all flight training\
  \ exercises by demonstrating their instructing \n \n30 Taupo Gliding Club  rules\
  \ 5.11.1(i).  \n \nFinal Report AO-2020 -002 |  \n<< Page 19 >>\n technique across\
  \ the training syllabus . It also has a  provision to limit an instructor 's \n\
  scope to instructing specific ex ercises.  \n3.41 The competency review is further\
  \ divided into two categories , each with its own form31: \none for new and intermediate\
  \ instructors , and the other for advanced and senior \ninstructors . The MOAP gives\
  \ clubs the freedom to reduce the period s between  \ninstructor competency reviews\
  \ to mitigate the effects of aging. A club , for example, \ncould place limitations\
  \ on an instructor to allow them to perform only a limited part of \ntheir role.\
  \  \n3.42 The club's practices had diverged from the requirements of GNZ . The CFI\
  \ used  just the \nBFR form  to assess  the competency  of instructor  pilots because\
  \ they considered it \ncovered the same requirements  as the competency review.\
  \ The CFI said they would \nconduct a BFR, then sometime later fill in the competency\
  \ review form. The CFI might \ndiscuss with the pilot the exercises listed in the\
  \ appropriate form. The club's instructor \ntrainer believed that the CFI could\
  \ request any instructor to submit to a competency \nreview, but they were usually\
  \ used in special situations (eg, to check overseas pilots or \nif there were  a\
  \ particular concern with an instructor's competency).  \n3.43 The club  tracked\
  \ BFRs  with other pilot records to ensure that all club pilots remain ed \ncurrent\
  \ , but there was  no similar system for tracking a competency review where a \n\
  pilot was also an instructor.  Competency reviews  were not conducted regularly\
  \  and \nwere not tracked  to monitor their currency , and not all instructors had\
  \ completed \ncompetency review s in their club file s.  \n3.44 The MOAP32 requires\
  \ a competency review to be carried out by the CFI , an instructor \ntrainer , a\
  \ ROO or the NOO . A glider pilot's logbook must be endorsed with a certificate\
  \ \nto show appropriate currency and privileges  in accordance with their competency\
  \ \nreview . The accident instructor's logbook had not been endorsed with a competency\
  \ \nreview check. The instructor had not logged a glider flight with the club's\
  \ instructor \ntrainer between the start of 2018 and the accident in May 2020, and\
  \ the CFI had never  \nflown  with the instructor . The last check flight with a\
  \ ROO  or NOO  had been on 21 \nJanuary 2018  for the  instructor's  'C' Category\
  \  instructor rating. The instructor had \ncompleted BFRs in New Zealand and instructors\
  \ in France had conducted check flights \nwith the instructor since 2018 , but these\
  \ were not substitute s for a logbook \nendorsement or a competency review  in New\
  \ Zealand . The instructor had completed a \nrecent BFR , conducted by another of\
  \ the club's 'B' Category instructor s, but this was \nnot acceptable under  GNZ\
  \ procedures to allow the instructor to continue to instruct.   \n3.45 The MOAP\
  \  describes the requirement for an instructor to have a competency review \nless\
  \ than two years old, and if not , that instructor is not considered current and\
  \ not \npermitted to exercise the privileges of an instructor rating.  The instructor\
  \ did not have \na current competency review,  and had not  flown with someone who\
  \ was authorised to \ncarry out a competency review  in the 24 months prior to \
  \ the accident.  \nGNZ audits   \n3.46 GNZ holds an Aviation Recreation Organisation\
  \ Certification under CAR Part 149 to \nconduct gliding operations in New Zealand.\

  \ are audited every years two and four in a five-year audit cycle .  \n3.47 A GNZ\
