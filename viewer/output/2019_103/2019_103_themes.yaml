- name: Track Condition and Maintenance
  explanation: The track condition and its maintenance were significant factors in the derailment. The report identified that there was no procedure for identifying, evaluating, and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature, which can promote unintended oscillation of wagons and potentially result in derailment. "Currently there is no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature that promote the unintended oscillation of wagons, potentially resulting in a derailment" (3.12). Additionally, the post-derailment manual track measurements showed a series of twists before and after the point of derailment (POD), which were within the allowed tolerances individually but not considered for their combined effect (3.10, 3.19).
- name: Train Speed Compliance
  explanation: Adherence to authorized line speeds is crucial for safe train operations, especially through points. In this accident, the train was traveling at nearly 36% above the authorized line speed, which was close to its critical rocking speed, contributing to the derailment. "The train was travelling at 9 km/h or 36% above the maximum authorised line speed when it derailed" (3.17). The train's speed in combination with the track condition likely accentuated harmonic oscillations, pushing the wagon's stability to the boundary of instability (3.19).
- name: Wagon Design and Maintenance
  explanation: The design and maintenance of the wagon, particularly its suspension system, were contributing factors to the derailment. The report found that the leading bogie of the derailed wagon had ineffective damping due to broken springs and out-of-code float readings. "A combination of three broken springs and out-of-code float readings resulted in wagon UKN143 having ineffective damping on its leading bogie" (4.4). Moreover, the last full overhaul of the wagon occurred over 12 years prior to the accident, indicating potential shortcomings in the maintenance regime (4.5).
- name: Load Distribution and Center of Gravity
  explanation: The center of gravity of the loaded wagon affects its stability, especially when traversing curves. The relatively high center of gravity of the loaded log wagon, while within allowable limits, was likely to have had a destabilizing effect, contributing to the wagon's ability to climb the rail and pass over the railhead. "While within the allowable limits, the relatively high centre of gravity of wagon UKN143 was about as likely as not to have had a destabilising effect" (3.34). This theme is relevant as it directly impacts the dynamic behavior of the wagon during operation.
- name: Driver Training and Performance
  explanation: The performance of the train driver and their adherence to operational protocols are critical for safety. In this case, the driver did not ensure that the rear of the train was clear of station limits before exceeding the authorized speed, and the train was traveling above the maximum authorized line speed at the time of derailment. "The driver had not ensured that the rear of the train was clear of station limits before the train speed could exceed 25 km/h" (3.17). Although fatigue was considered, the Commission was unable to determine if it contributed to the driver's actions (3.41).
- name: Safety Management and Oversight
  explanation: Effective safety management and oversight are essential to identify and mitigate risks. The lack of procedures for dealing with cyclic track twists and the absence of a recent full overhaul for the derailed wagon's bogies suggest gaps in safety management practices. "Currently there is no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature" (3.12) and "More than 12 years had passed since a full overhaul check had taken place on wagon UKN143" (4.5). These gaps could allow for the accumulation of conditions that increase the risk of accidents.
