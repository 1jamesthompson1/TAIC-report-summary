  \ While the overall likelihood  of a freight train derailment is low, a derailment\
  \ can \npotentially cause significant damage and injury.  In this accident  the\
  \ derailed wagons \nripped up a section of track and points, damaged traction  masts\
  \ and brought down an \noverhead traction li ne while passing under an overbridge\
  \ supporting a major roadway.  \n3.2. The first wagon to derail was a UKN -class\
  \ wagon  converted from a general -purpose  UK-\nclass, container -carrying , flat-deck\
  \ wagon  with standard Type 14 bogies. The UK-class \nwagon s had been  assembled\
  \ in New Zealand from kits supplied from Japan  between \n1971 and 1981 .   \n3.3.\
  \ Wagons fitted with Type  14 bogies  featured more fr equently  in the KiwiRail\
  \ derailment \nstatistics.  For the year ending  30 June 2019, wagons fitted with\
  \  Type 14 bogies ran 40% \nof the total track  kilometres yet featured in  eight\
  \  of the 10 (80%)  derailments  on the rail \nnetwork . The Commission found no\
  \ evidence to suggest that the Type 14 bogies ' design \ncontributed to the derailment.\
  \  \n3.4. The following analysis discusses  the safety factors that contributed\
  \ to the derailment and \nthe safety factors  that were considered but found to\
  \ be non -contributory.  \nSafety f actors contributing to t he derailment   \n\
  3.5. The movement of any type of wagon at speed along a track cause s a range of\
  \ motions  \nand oscillations, of which some are undesirable.  The amplitude and\
  \ effect depend on \nmany factors including  the condition of the track, the train\
  \ speed, the wagon design, the \ncondition  of the wagon suspension systems , and\
  \ the height of the centre of gravity of a \nloaded wagon .  \n3.6. Often, oscillations\
  \ result from track irregularitie s, which can be accentuated on wagons \nwith excessive\
  \ float tolerances and/or broken  suspension  springs.  \n3.7. In respect of this\
  \ derailment , the Commission found there was an insuffi cient vertical \nload on\
  \ the leading bogie of log-carrying wagon UKN143 to prevent it climb ing the \n\
  outer (right -hand) curved r ail on the 29B set of points  (see Figure 8).  \n3.8.\
  \ The POD was confirmed by a light, 1 m long wheel flange witness mark across the\
  \ \nrailhead.  The absence of scuff markings on the inside of the rail indicated\
  \ that the wheel \nlifted suddenly onto the railhead before dropping on the outside\
  \ of the rail.  \n3.9. The Commission found that no single factor led to this derailment.\
  \ Instead, it is very \nlikely that a combination of factors contributed to the\
  \ wheel climb that resulted in the \nderailment:  \n\uF0B7 the track condition and\
  \ its alignment  \n\uF0B7 the train travelling at nearly 36% above the authorised\
  \ line speed , which was close to \nits critical rocking speed26  \n           \
  \                                             \n26 The speed at the boundary of\
  \ stable and unstable bogie running.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2019 -103 \n<< Page\
  \ 13 >>\n \uF0B7 the condition of the wagon's suspension system and its sensitivity\
  \ to the track \nconditions  \n\uF0B7 the multiple cyclic twists that accentuated\
  \ the wagon oscillation  \n\uF0B7 the high, but nevertheless within limits, centre\
  \ of gravity of the loaded log wagon . \n \nFigure 8: Point of derailment  \nThe\
  \ effect of t rack  condition  and speed on  the derailment   \nEffect of the track\
  \ condition  \nSafety issue: There was no procedure for identifying, evaluating\
  \ and rectifying track twists of a \nrepetitive cyclic nature.  \n3.10. An analysis\
  \ of the post-derailment  manual  track measure ments  showed the following \n(see\
  \ Figure 9):  \n\uF0B7 -20 mm twist, 31 m before the POD  \n\uF0B7 +8 mm twist,\
  \ 24 m before the POD  \n\uF0B7 -18 mm twist, 19 m before the POD  \n\uF0B7 +7 mm\
  \ twist, 12 m before the POD  \n\uF0B7 -18 mm twist, 6  m before the POD  \n\uF0B7\
  \ +14 mm twist, 2 m past the POD  \n\uF0B7 -17 mm twist, 6 m past the POD  \n\n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -103 \uF0B7 +21 mm twist, 16 m past\
  \ the POD . \n \nFigure 9: Output graph of twists over 4 m (provided by KiwiRail)\
  \  \n3.11. The KiwiRail  Standard T -ST-AM-5120, Track Geometry, effective since\
  \ 3 March 2017, \ncategorise s manually  found twists within a yard environment\
  \ of 1 7-19 mm as Priority 4 , \nrequiring the condition  to be fixed  within 26\
  \ weeks.  Twists of 20 -23 mm are deemed to \nbe Priority 3 , requiring the repair\
  \ to be completed within four weeks.  The standard refers \nto individual track\
  \ twists but makes no reference to the effect s of cyclic twists.  \n3.12. It was\
  \ unlikely that each twist wou ld have been identified during a scheduled visual\
  \ \ninspectio n. The post -derailmen t track measure -up showed that the value of\
  \ each twist \ndid not meet the threshold for immediate repair action . However,\
  \ the twists' combined \neffect s and contribution to wagon oscillation were not\
  \ analysed . Currently there is no \nprocedu re for identifying, evaluating and\
  \ rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic \nnature that promote the unintended\
  \ oscillation of wagons , potentially resulting in a \nderailment.  A recommendation\
  \ has been made to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to \naddress this issue.   \n\
  \  \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2019 -103 \n<< Page 15 >>\n Effect of train speed  \n\
  3.13. Safe operation through a set of points requires a driver to comply with the\
  \ authorised \nline speed in order to reduce the likelihood of wheel climb.  Although\
  \ the set of crossover \npoints was designed for a maximum of 40 km/h running, these\
  \ points were sited within \nPalmerston North station limits , where train speeds\
  \ were permanently restricted to a \nmaximum 25 km/h.  The set of crossover points\
  \ within the yard environment was \nmaintained to standards appropriate for train\
  \ speed s of 25 km/h.    \n3.14. The driver was starting their third consecutive\
  \ identical shift  departing from Palmerston \nNorth Yard with Train 626 . Although\
  \ the maximum authorised line speed was 25 km/h \nfor all three departures, the\
  \ routes  were not  the same . For the first two departures t he \ntrain was routed\
  \  along the Branch Main line, which  did not require it to pass over \nnumber 29\
  \ crossover points.   \n3.15. On the third departure , just prior to the derai lment,\
  \  the train had been routed along the \narrival and departure road , which required\
  \ it to pass over number 29 points ( see Figure \n2). The train was travelling at\
  \ the maximum authorised line speed when the lead \nlocomotive passed over the crossover\
  \ points . At about the same time, the driver applied \nmore power . A combination\
  \ of a gentle down gradient and the additional power allowed \nthe train speed to\
  \ increase to 34 km/h when the first wagon derailed .  \n3.16. Train drivers who\
  \ are trained and certified in the use of  'DAS' are required to use the \nsystem\
  \ on all trains where the route s have been verified and the locomotive s are \n\
  equipped with fully functional unit s. The system provides a visual output of \n\
  topographical and network data and provides driver s with information that include\
  \ s the \nlength of a train, the suggested speed and the operating mode. Speed restrictions\
  \ are \nupdated automatically into the DAS server.  \n3.17. The KiwiRail Rail Operating\
  \ Code required the driver to use the locomotive speedometer \nat all times to determine\
  \ train speed , as the DAS global positioning system had not been \napproved.  At\
  \ the time of the derailment the locomotive's speedometer was displaying a \n1%\
  \ error.  The driver had not ensured  that the rear of the train was clear of station\
  \ limits \nbefore the train speed could  exceed 25 km/h.  In this case the train\
  \ was travelling at 9 \nkm/h or 36% above the maximum authorised line speed when\
  \ it derailed, still within \nstation limits.  \nCombined effect of track and speed\
  \  \n3.18. In most cases wagon oscill ation is minimal at speeds below 50 km/h .\
  \ However,  a \ncombination of track irregularities and the natural roll frequency\
  \ of  a loaded wagon  can \nresult in unstable running conditions  and wagon oscillation\
  \ .   \n3.19. Although the cyclic twists referred to in 3 .10 were individually\
  \ at the lower end of the \nallowed tolerances , they were  evenly s paced at 12\
  \ m , corresponding to the distance \nbetween bogie centres . The combined effect\
  \ of the train speed and the natural roll \nfrequency of the wagon  was at the boundary\
  \ of in stability and likely produced a low \nspeed 'rock and roll' motion.  \n\
  3.20. On straight track, the oscillating  motion is unlikely to result in a derailment\
  \ , as there is no \nlateral force applied when the wheel load is reduced.  However,\
  \ on this occasion the \napplied lateral force increased as the wagon traversed\
  \  the curved rail on the set of \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -103\
  \ points.  At the same time , the oscillating motion reduced the wheel load on the\
  \ outside \nrail, which caused the wheel to lift onto and then pass over the railhead\
  \ .  \nThe post -derailm ent condition of  wagon UKN143  \n3.21. All rail wagons\
  \ have some form of damping to minimise the amount of bounce \nassociated with external\
  \  influences such as track condition . The bogies of the UKN -class \nwagon  use\
  \ a suspension arrangement where by the vertical m ovement is damped by \nfriction.\
  \ The key components are spring s and friction wedges.  \n3.22. The KiwiRail Mechanical\
  \ C ode requires all wagons that derail , along with the wagon s \nimmediately in\
  \ front of and behind the derailed wagons , to be examined and \nmeasurements  recorded\
  \ . The post-derailment recorded measurements for wagon \nUKN143 can be found in\
  \ Appendix 2. The post-derailment examination showed  that the \nfloat on both bogies\
  \ exceed ed the allowable range  and that there was a significant  \ndifference\
  \ in values on either side  of the wagon.  Float above the prescribed value s \n\
  increase s the possibility of a derailment .  \nPost -derailment examination  of\
  \ wagon UKN143 bogies   \n3.23. Following the derailment , the bogies were transported\
  \ to KiwiRail's Hutt Workshops for \nfurther examination  (see Figure 10). On 9\
  \ May 2019 the bogies were dismantled , their \ncomponents were examined , and critical\
  \ measurements of the components were \nrecorded.  \n \nFigure 10: Leading bogie\
  \ from UKN143 before examination   \n3.24. The centre bowl liner on the leading\
  \ bogie showed significant wear and distortion  \n(see Figure 11). The trailing\
  \ bogie was relatively undamaged. It was likely that the \ndamage to the bowl liner\
  \ on the leading bogie was sustained during the derailment \nsequen ce.   \n\n \n\
  Final Report RO -2019 -103 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 3.25. Further examination of the leading\
  \ bogie revealed two broken inner cylindrical helical \nsprings on the right -hand\
  \ side in the direction of travel.  Both failures had occurred at \nsimilar heights,\
  \ about one turn from the top (see Figure  12). The signific ant levels of \ncorrosion\
  \ on the fracture surfaces indicated that the springs had very likely fractured\
  \ \nbefore the derailment.  \n3.26. A similar fracture  of an inner spring had also\
  \ occurred on the right -hand side of the \ntrailing bogie.  \n3.27. The two broken\
  \ inner springs on the leading bogie would have reduced the effectiveness \nof its\
  \ suspension stiffness by about 8.5%.  The reduced spring performance and its \n\
  detrimental effect s on the suspension would have likely contributed to the wagon's\
  \ \ninability to recover from an osci llation and , in doing so, likely contributed\
  \ to the \nderailment.    \n \nFigure 11: Centre bowl liner on leading bogie  \n\
  \ \n\n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -103  \nFigure 12: Fractured inner\
  \ springs  \nWagon i nspection requirements  \n3.28. The bogies from UKN143 were\
  \ subject to routine  maintenance and  inspections , of which \none was a C -Check,\
  \ which was performed every two years. The C -Check inspection was \nless rigorous\
  \ than a full overhaul. It included a visual inspection of the springs but did \n\
  not include a comple te breakdown of the bogie or any spring measurements. A full\
  \ \noverhaul was only required when the C -Check identified wedge height measurements\
  \ \nabove 39 mm . \n3.29. The full bogie overhaul required a full breakdown of the\
  \ bogie and an examination and \nmeasurement of the column liners, checking that\
  \ the paired side frames were of the \nsame length, and checking that no part s\
  \ of the springs were broken or cracked and each \nspring passe d the minimum -length\
  \ te st.  \n3.30. Records provided by KiwiRail showed  that the leading bogie from\
  \ wagon  UKN143 had \nlast undergone a full overhaul in March 2007 . The wedge height\
  \ measurements  from the \nmost recent C -Check  were between 29 mm and 31 mm .\
  \ This  showed that the ride -\ncontrol e lements were at about mid -life, with\
  \ an expected five more years of operation \nbefore the next full bogie overhaul\
  \ was required.    \nCentre of gravity  of the loaded wagon  \n3.31. A key objective\
  \ when loading wagons is to maximise the load stability by keeping the \ncentre\
  \ of gravity as close to the wagon deck as possible.  The higher the centre of gravity\
  \ \nof a loaded log wagon, the greater the destabilising effect from the lateral\
  \ force created \nwhen the wagon follows a curve such as that found at a set of\
  \ points.  The destabilising \neffect increases the chance of the wagon starting\
  \ to oscillate and thereby increas es the \nlikelihood of a derailment.   \n\n \n\
  Final Report RO -2019 -103 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 3.32. The National Rail System Standard\
  \ , Section 6, Engineering Interoperability Standards, \nClause 7.4 stated in part:\
  \  \nThe cen tre of gravity should be as low as practicable.  \nThe centre of gravity\
  \ height for any vehicle loading condition must not \nexceed 2.0 m above rail level\
  \ for bogie vehicles.  \n3.33. Because the centre  of gravity  of a loaded log wagon\
  \  can be relatively high , it can have  \nthe effect of lowering the speed at which\
  \ a wagon can derail.   \n3.34. The calculated combined centre of gravity for wagon\
  \ UKN143, the log cradles and its \ndeclared load was about 1.75 m above rail level,\
  \ within the maximum allowable 2.0 m.  \nWhile within the allowa ble limits, the\
  \ relatively high centre of gravity of wagon UKN143 \nwas about as likely as not\
  \ to have had a destabilising effect , which assisted its ability to \nclimb the\
  \ rail and lift onto and then pass over the railhead .  \nNon-contributing factors\
  \  \nLoading  \n3.35. The KiwiRail Freight  Handling Code set the maximum load capacity\
  \ for UKN -class \nwagons at 33.0 tonnes. Although logs  are generally of variable\
  \ low density , it is unlikely \nthat load capacity is exceeded on this class of\
  \ wagon.  In this case , the declared weig ht of \n29.28 tonnes was 88.7% of the\
  \ maximum  permitted  load. However, the distribution of \nthe load was unknown\
  \ because the loaded wagon had not passed over a weighbridge.    \n3.36. The Commission\
  \ found that the log -loading process and nett weight of the logs were \nunlikely\
  \ to be contributory to the derailment.  \nFatigue  \n3.37. Fatigue is generally\
  \ defined as a physiological state of reduced mental or physical \nperformance capability\
  \ resulting from sleep loss , extended wakefulness, circadian phase \nand/or workload\
  \ that can impair a person's alertness and ability to perform  safety -\nrelated\
  \ operational  duties27.  \n3.38. It was the train driver's practice to sleep soon\
  \ after finishing a night shift.  In this case , the \ndriver had finished the previous\
  \ night's six-hour 10-minute shift and was asleep shortly \nafter 0400.  The driver\
  \ was expecting visitors  later that morning so woke shortly after \n0800.  The\
  \ driver recalled having a two-hour  sleep later that day and waking at 1700. The\
  \ \ndriver had an evening meal at home before making the 30-minute drive to work,\
  \ arriving \nat about 2130 . Therefore, the driver had been awake for about five\
  \ hours prior to the \nderailment .  \n3.39. The driver self -reported as 'fit for\
  \ duty' on arrival at work and the derailment occurred \nwithin the Palmerston North\
  \ stati on limits about 20 minutes after the driver had booked \non for work and\
  \ at a time when the workload was not overly high.   \n3.40. At interview , the\
  \ driver confirmed feeling  alert but may have been 'a bit lagged ' due to \nnot\
  \ having their usual sleep .  \n                                               \
  \         \n27 ICAO Doc 9966 - Manual for the Oversight of Fatigue Management Approaches.\
  \  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -103 3.41. The driver's qu antity\
  \ of sleep was less than normal and this was the driver's third \nconsecutive night\
  \ shift ; both increased the potential for them  to be experiencing the \neffects\
  \ of fatigue . However, the low workload at the time of and prior to the derailment\
  \ , \nand the sho rt time on shift , countered this potential. Therefore, the Commission\
  \ was \nunable to determine if fatigue contributed to the driver's actions.  \n\
