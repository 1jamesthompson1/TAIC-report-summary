- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no direct evidence in the document that fatigue management played a role in the derailment. The driver had been awake for about five hours prior to the derailment and self-reported as 'fit for duty' (3.38-3.40). The Commission was unable to determine if fatigue contributed to the driver's actions (3.41).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The driver did not ensure that the rear of the train was clear of station limits before the train speed could exceed 25 km/h, and the train was traveling at 9 km/h or 36% above the maximum authorised line speed when it derailed (3.17). This indicates a human error in judgment regarding the train's speed.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document suggesting that a lack of training or competency contributed to the derailment.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide evidence that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment was a contributing factor to the derailment.

    '
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in the derailment as there is no mention of teamwork, communication, or decision-making issues in the document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The driver exceeded the authorised line speed, which is a deviation from safety procedures (3.17). This non-adherence to safety procedures contributed to the derailment.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The lack of a procedure for identifying, evaluating, and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature indicates a potential issue with the organizational safety culture (3.12, 4.6). This contributed to the derailment by not addressing the combined effects of track irregularities.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The absence of a procedure to manage the risks associated with cyclic track twists (3.12, 4.6) and the failure to identify the combined effect of track and speed on wagon oscillation (3.19) indicate shortcomings in risk management and analysis.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document suggesting that a lack of regulatory oversight and compliance contributed to the derailment.

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The driver's failure to maintain situational awareness regarding the train's speed and its location relative to station limits contributed to the derailment (3.17).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide information on emergency response preparedness or its relevance to the derailment.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The leading bogie from wagon UKN143 had not undergone a full overhaul in more than 12 years (4.5), and there were broken springs and out-of-code float readings (4.4). Inadequate maintenance and inspection regimes contributed significantly to the derailment.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of automation or its impact on the derailment in the document.

- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions are not discussed as a contributing factor to the derailment in the document.

- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that communication breakdown was a factor in the derailment.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The "Other" category includes the combined effect of the train travelling at about 36% above the maximum authorised line speed and the natural roll frequency of the wagon at the boundary of instability, which likely accentuated harmonic oscillations (4.3). It also includes the ineffective damping on the leading bogie due to broken springs and out-of-code float readings (4.4), and the relatively high center of gravity of the log wagon (4.2). These factors are not covered by the predefined safety themes but were significant contributors to the derailment.
