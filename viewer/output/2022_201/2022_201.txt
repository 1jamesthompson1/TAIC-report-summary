No repeat accidents – ever!  
“The principal purpose of the Commission shall be to determine the circumstances and 
causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future, 
rather than to ascribe blame to any person.”  
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity and 
standing commission of inqui ry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents that occur in New Zealand  or involve New Zealand -registered aircraft or 
vessels.  
Our investigations are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve safety. Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue criminal, civil  or regulatory action.  
At the end of every inquiry, we sh are all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve safety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event h appened, or a condition existed , in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission 
chose these models because of thei r simplicity, usability, and international use. The 
Commission considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include making 
findings and issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not 
that evidence would be admiss ible in a court of law.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 1 Executive  summary  
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1 The charter fishing vessel Enchanter  was on a five-day fis hing trip from Mang ōnui in 
Northland  to the Three Kings Island s with eight  passengers and two crew on board . On 
20 March  2022 , it was heading  back from the Three Kings Islands  towards Murimotu  
Island off North Cape , where the skipper  intended to anchor for the night . 
1.2 At about 1950 the vessel was broadly  east of  Murimotu  Island when it was struck on its 
port side by a l arge steep wave , rapidly rolling the vessel onto its side. The 
superstructure comprising  the main saloon and the flybridge separate d from the hull  
and the Enchanter  capsized . 
1.3 The New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre (the RCC) was alerted to the accident by 
the crew activating their Emergency Position -Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and 
initiated a search and rescue response.  
1.4 Only five of the ten people survived the accident. The survivors  were retrieved from the 
upturned hull and other floating debris by the first rescue helicopter to arrive at the 
scene . The bodies of the remaining five people  were recover ed after an almost two -day 
search and rescue operation inv olving multiple aircraft and sur face vessels.  
Why it happened  
1.5 The Enchanter should easily have coped with the sea conditions off North Cape at the 
time of the accident . However , it is about as likely as not  the vessel had strayed into 
shallower water off Murimotu  Island , an area that  is prone to  occasional, naturally 
occurring , larger waves peak ing as they entered  the shallow ing water .  
1.6 When the Enchanter  rapidly rolled onto its side , the force  of the water  exceeded the 
design parameters of the vessel’s superstructure . This  caused the  superstructure  to 
separate from the hull , resulting in  the Enchanter fully capsiz ing. 
1.7 Due to the suddenness of the capsize  none of the people were wearing or had access 
to life jacket s, and the life raft s likely  did not automatically deploy , which  left those in 
the water with no or limited means of flotation.  
1.8 None of the four lifebuoy s on board had effective retro reflective tape  and only two 
had a strobe  light attached . Add to this  the absence of life jacket s with their  strobe 
lights and retrorefle ctive markings , it would have been  difficult to detect the missing  
people in the water at night . 
1.9 There was a significant delay in the search for the  five missing people while fuel for the 
rescue helicopt ers was sourced . Three of the missing people were alive in the water  
when last seen by the survivors but  were  later found deceased .   
1.10 Although we cannot determine with any certainty  whether  it would have changed the 
outcome in this particular situation, the chances of surv ival after an accident are 
greater if search and rescue operations are conducted promptly . 
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 2 >>
 What we can learn  
1.11 For any forecast or actual sea conditions, mariners should at any time expect to 
encounter occasional waves up to twice the average size.  
1.12 Mariners should , if possible , avoid navigating in shallow water in adverse wave 
conditions . If shallow water cannot be avoided, they should be particularly vigilant and 
expect waves much larger and steeper than those expected in deeper water.  
1.13 It is importa nt that passengers either practi se putting on a life jacket  or are given a 
demonstration o f how to do so during a safety briefing, rather than having to work this 
out under the pressure of an emergency.   
1.14 Safety will be better served if life jacket s are dis tributed in several places around a 
vessel where they will be more accessible in a sudden emergency.  
1.15 Wearing an inflatable life jacket  or similar buoyancy aid will enhance the safety of 
people when fishing from open decks in open and exposed waters.  
1.16 There is safety benefit in wearing a personal locator beacon as a backup  to the EPIRBs 
required on commercial vessels , in case the circumstances of an accident prevent the 
use of the latter.  
1.17 Fitting an Automatic Identification System ( AIS) or equivalent tracking device to a 
vessel  will significantly improve the likelihood of being found and reduce the time for 
being rescued, particularly if the primary life -saving equipment fails or cannot be 
activated.  
Who may benefit  
1.18 All mariners, maritime regulatory agencies , and agencies and operators involved in 
search and rescue operations .

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 2 Factual information  
Pārongo pono  
Background  
2.1 The Enchanter  was a 16.2-metre  charter fishing vessel operated by Enchanter  Fishing 
Charters , primaril y out of Mangōnui  in Northland, New Zealand . A group of eight  
people had booked a five-day fishing charter out of  Mangōnui  to the Three Kings 
Island s, beginning on Thursday 17 March  2022 . 
Narrative  
2.2 The eight people  (passengers ) arrived on board the Enchanter  on Wednesday 
16 March  2022  and spent the night on board at the berth in Mangōnui . The next 
morning  17 March  2022 , the skipper  gave the passengers a safety briefing , which 
included the location and operation of the various lif e-saving apparatus. The 
passengers were told that all the life jacket s were stowed under the bunks in the forward 
passenger cabin but  were not shown what they looked like or how to put them  on. 
2.3 The Enchanter  departed Mangōnui  at about 0830  with the skipper, first mate and the 
eight passengers on board. The Enchanter  towed  fishing lures1 for the trip to the Three 
Kings  Islands  and anchored in Northwest Bay on Great Island for the night  (see  
Figure 3). The weather was fine with light winds . 
   
Figure 3: Annotated part of Chart NZ 23  
2.4 On 18  March  2022  the Enchanter  went to Middlesex Bank to fish for the day and 
returned to Northwest Bay on Great Island for the night. Again , the weather was fine 
with light winds .

 2.5 On 19  March  2022  the Enchanter  went to King Bank to fish for the day  and returned to 
Little Bear Bay on Great Island for the night. Again, the weather was fine with light 
winds.  
2.6 The skipper chose Little Bear Bay on the southwest side of Great Island to shelter from 
forecast northeast conditions associated with a weather system that was to pass over 
the area during the night . 
2.7 The weather system passed through the area as forecast . At about 0600 o n 
20 March  2022  it was still raining and the winds were strong from the northeast.  The 
Enchanter  remained at the Little Bear Bay anchor age while the passengers  breakfasted 
and fished  in the bay . The weather beg an to ease, so a t about  1030  the Enchanter  left 
Little Bear Bay and headed for the Princes Island s about five nautical miles  (nm) to the 
northwest. There they fished in the lee of the islands  until 1330, at which time the 
skipper judged the sea conditions had eased sufficiently to make the journey to North 
Cape . Their intention was to anchor for the night in the lee of Murimot u Island  (see 
Figure 2). 
2.8 The weather  conditions for the first part of what was to be about a seven -hour trip 
were described as between two - and three -metre waves with the wind still blowing 
about 20 knots from the northeast.  
2.9 By 1700 the weather had cleared,  and the sea conditions eased enough for the skipper 
to allow the passengers to open the side windows to the main saloon . They also 
deploy ed the towed fishing lures.  
2.10 At 1940 the skipper called  Far North Radio on the VHF radio and advised of their 
intention  to anchor for the night ‘under ’ Murimotu  Island . It was agreed  that the 
skipper  would call Far North Radio once the Enchanter  was anchored , in approximately 
one hour . 
2.11 As the Enchanter  closed with the co astline near North Cape, six of the passengers were 
relaxing in the saloon , one was asleep in the forward cabin  and one was seated on the 
aft deck monitoring the fishing rods. The first mate was in the galley cooking the 
evening meal and the skipper was on the flybridge  navigating the vessel . The 
Enchanter  was being steered by autopilot.  During an initial interview the skipper said 
that they had “just started to turn to get us down ” (indicating a  change in heading to 
head more southerly). This was when the vessel was broadly north -northeast o f 
Murimotu Island  and before it reached a waypoint2 on the chart plotter , which the 
skipper  indicated was  broadly east -southeast  of Murimotu Island . The skipper later 
clarified  that only one course adjustment of about 10 degrees in a southerly direction 
had been made on the automatic pilot, and that this was to regain the track to th is 
waypoint .3 
2.12 The sky was clear , and it was just on dark . At about  1950  the vessel encountered  a 
large steep wave  on its port side . The wave rolled the vessel to starboard  in an instant . 
The superstructure and windows on the starboard side were forced into the water and 
imploded . The vessel continued to roll and capsized. During the capsize sequence t he 
superstructure comprising the main saloon and flybridge separated from the hul l. The

plotter.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 hull remained inverted but afloat. The floor of the flybridge (which was the roof of the 
main saloon below ) lay inverted , floating next to the capsized hull . 
2.13 Seven  of the eight  passengers and the first mate were either ejected or escaped from 
the vessel into the water . The passenger who was  sleeping in the forward cabin  was 
trapped there . The skipper  was able to escape from the inverted flybridge.  
2.14 Within minutes of the accident , the first mate  climbe d on top of the inverted  hull and 
made  a headcount . Including the first mate , nine people had survived the initial 
capsize . Two (the skipper and one passenger) had climbed on  top of the inverted  
flybridge , the first mate and two passengers were on the inverted hull, and four 
passengers  were in the water.  One of those four in the water had retrieved a lifebuoy , 
which they had placed over their head and under the ir armpits.  
2.15 Within minutes  the first mate noticed another  of the four passengers  in the water 
floating face down . The first mate entered  the water and attempted revival while 
swim ming  the passenger  to the inverted flybridge . Despite the combined efforts  of 
those on the inverted fly bridge , the passenger  remained unresponsive . Sometime  later 
the body drifted away from the flybridge  despite attempts to secure  it to the flybridge.  
2.16 Sometime before 2017, the Enchanter ’s Emergency Position -Indicating Radio Beacon 
(EPIRB )4 surfaced next to the skipper . The EPIRB had been secured in a float -free 
bracket on the deck at the back of  the flybridge (now underneath the inverted 
flybridge floor). The EPIRB was designed to float free from its bracket when submerged 
and automatically activate. However, the EPIRB had not activated so it was manually 
activated and tied to the inverted flybridge . 
2.17 Meanwhile the inverted hull and flybridge had drifted apart . At th at time the situation 
was: 
• two passengers were on the inverted hull  (2) 
• the skipper, first mate and one passenger were on the inverted flybridge  (3) 
• three passengers  were  last seen alive in the water , one with a lifebuoy  (3) 
• one passenger  was assumed deceased and in the water  (1) 
• one passenger was unaccounted for . (1) 
Search and rescue  
2.18 At 2017 the New Zealand  Rescue Co ordination Centre ( the RCC)  received a n initial  
beacon alert  from the Enchanter ’s EPIRB , indicating  a distress  off North Cape . Using the 
registration details for the EPIRB t he RCC contact ed the Enchanter ’s shore base and 
established that the Enchanter  was operating near North Cape . At about 2020 the RCC 
received the first encoded5 transmission from the EPIRB, which included global 
positioning system (GPS) coordinate s. 
2.19 At 2030  the RCC directed the Marine Operations Centre  to issue mayday relays on VHF 
Channel 16 , requesting all vesse ls in the vicinity to aid  in the response.  There were no 
vessels in the immediate area  at that time . 
 
4 An Emergency Position -Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) is designed to transmit its location and verification data 
to a rescue coordination cent re and thus alert search and rescue authorities that an emergency exists.  
5 See Appendix 5 for a detailed description of the data obtained from the EPIRB .

<< Page 6 >>
 2.20 At about  2035 the RCC briefed the Coastguard New Ze aland (Coastguard) Duty Officer , 
who was  based in Auckland . Coast guard’s northern most  unit, Coastguard  Houhora , 
was then tasked to respond . The RCC also tasked6 the Northland Emergency Services 
Trust (NEST )7 helicopter crew  based in Whang arei. The NEST crew  gave an estimated 
time to departure  of 20–30 minutes.  
  
Figure 4: Search and rescue locations  
 
2.21 At 2109 Coast guard advised  the RCC that , having  conducted a risk assessment , they 
would not be able to respond at night  due to  the limitations of their vessel and the 
severity of the  weather  forecast . They also belie ved that there would be no air support 
in the area until the weather abated. At 2110 NEST advised  the RCC there would be a  
delay while they assembled the appropriate helicopter crew. NEST also request ed the 
RCC to task another helicopter from the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust (ARHT)  to 
assist with the response , which the RCC completed at approximately 2200 . 
2.22 At 2205 the NEST helicopter departed from Whang arei. NEST maintained a fuel trail er 
at Kaitaia Hospital .8 As this was the most norther ly point where fuel would be available , 
both helicopter crews planned to land and refuel from the trailer to maximi se their 
time on scene  at North Cape  (see Figure 4).  
2.23 At 2250 the NEST helicopter arrived at Kaitaia Hospital to refuel and at 2313  departed 
Kaitaia , heading for the position c oordinates transmitted by the Enchanter ’s EPIRB.  
Meanwhile  the ARHT helicopter departed from Ardmore Aerodrome in Auckland  at 
2252 . The NEST  helicopter arrive d on scene  at about 2340 and immediately detected  
 
6 Assigned  as an asset  to be used for the SAR event.  
7 Northland Emergency Services Trust and Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust had at the time merged to become  
one company , Northern Rescue Helicopter  Limited  (NRHL) . However, they  were still in the process of aligning 
the two previous entities operation ally. For the purposes of this report,  we have retained their original names 
for clarity  of the narrative.  
8 About 95 per cent of their work was in relation to air ambulance services .

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 two light sources . The first was a strobe light in the water . However , it was not attached 
to anything . 
2.24 The second light source w as from the vessel ’s EPIRB  attached  to the inverted flybridge , 
to which  the skipper , first mate and one passenger were clinging . The helicopter crew 
conducted a risk assessment  and then  lowered a rescue swimmer to the water . The 
three survivors were then winched on board  one-by-one, accompanied by the rescue 
swimmer . 
2.25 By now, New Zealand  Police (NZ Police) had been briefed and had set up a forward 
command post at Te Hapua , the closest poi nt to the search area with road access.  At 
0013 the NEST helicopter departed the scene  and flew  the three  rescued survivors to 
Te Hapua , where  they were transferred  to ambulance staff. While in flight the 
helicopter crew learned from the survivors that: two people were last seen sitting  on 
the inverted hull; three  were in the water ; one was in the water  (but likely deceased ); 
and one was unaccounted for (but was likely trapped in the inverted hull ). 
2.26 The NEST helicopter returned immedia tely to the scene to resume  the search. They 
detected  another light source that proved  to be from the two passengers on  the 
inverted hull. One of the passengers had used the light from a mobile  phone to attract 
their attention.  They had earlier tried to make an emergency 111 call but were 
unsuccessful because of  poor mobile coverage in the area. In a similar fashion to the 
first retrieval the two passengers were retrieved by 0108 . The helicopter crew decided 
to fly these two  survivors directly to Kaitaia Hospital as the helicopter was running low 
on fuel. 
2.27 Meanwhile, the A RHT helicopter  had stopped at North Shore Aerodrome to pick up a 
more experienced winch operator , then at Dargaville  to top up w ith fuel , and again at 
Kaitaia Hospital to top up with fuel from the NEST trailer before heading to the scene.  
The two helicopters passed each other in flight and exchanged information . 
2.28 The NEST  helicopter landed at Kaitaia Hospi tal and transferred the two passenge rs to 
medical staff. The helicopter crew then refuelled from the fuel trailer. However, there 
was not enough fuel remaining to return to the scene, so that helicopter remained at 
Kaitaia Hospital.  
2.29 The ARHT  helicopter arrived on scene at 01 30 to begin the s earch for the five missing 
people . Meanwhile, the RCC had also tasked a  Royal New Zealand  Airforce P3 Orion 
aeroplane (P3) to assist in the search . The P3  arrived on scene at about the same time  
as the A RHT helicopter . The RCC assigned the  P3 as on -scene coordinat or9 circling at  a 
higher altitude . The helicopter searched at a lower level in the dark for about an  hour 
and 2 0 minutes before it too ran low on fuel and landed at the Te Hapua forward 
command post  at 0257 . 
2.30 Meanwhile, a  fuel tanker  had been sourced at Kerikeri and was sent northwards , 
arriving at Kaitaia Hospital at 0511. The NEST helicopter was refuelled , but by then the 
helicopter crew had exceeded the limits of their  work/rest operational hours , thus 
preventing them from rejoining  the search effort . The fuel tanker  then travelled  north 
to Te Hapua forward  command post , arriving there  at about 0700. The ARHT helicopter 
refuelled  and departed for the search area again at 073 3. For 4  hours and 36 minutes 
there were no helicopter  air assets  able to search because  no fuel was available .

 2.31 Meanwhile , several vessels had responded to the mayday relay calls. Another of the 
operator’s fishing charter vessel s Pacific Invader  had departed Mangōnui  and arrived at 
the search area at 0400 . A commercial fishing vessel  Florence Nightingale , which had 
been out at the Three Kings Islands at the time of the accident , arrived soon after 0400 . 
Another commercial fishing vessel Katrina  arrived at the search area a t about 0612. All 
three vessels were coordinated into a search pattern or directed to items of interest by 
the P3 circling above.  
2.32 At about 0710 (first light ) the body of one of the passengers  was located and 
recovered by one of the surface search vessels . When the refuelled ARHT  helicopter 
had returned on scene , it took over as the on-scene coordinat or from the P3 , which 
was by then getting low on fuel . The bodies of another two passengers were recovered 
over the next 40 minutes , leaving two people  still missing . 
2.33 Meanwhile, preparing for  an extended search operation, the RCC had tasked a second 
rescue helicopter from AHRT . This second  helicopter arrived at the forward command 
post at 0907  and relieved the first helicopter . 
2.34 When the mayday relay s had been  broadcast , the inshore patrol  vessel HMNZS Taupo  
had been operating in the Hauraki Gul f. It diverted to the search area , arriving on scene 
at 1110. The RCC assigned HMNZS Taupo  with the role of on-scene coordinator,  tasked  
with ensur ing all marine assets were searching the designated areas assigned by the 
RCC. However, t he HMNZS Taupo  misunderstood the meaning of on-scene coordinator  
and assumed the naval warfare role of on-scene command, effectively taking control of 
the search away fro m RCC.  
2.35 Over  the following  hours multiple assets join ed the search including  Coast guard 
Houhora, two other commercial helicopters from Kerikeri  and another P3.  
2.36 At 1319 the body of a fourth  passenger was located and recovered , leaving one 
passenger still missing.  By 1527 the RCC had realised that air assets were  not following 
their assigned  search patterns . HMNZS Taupo  had directed all assets to search another 
area, based on their own drift-modelling calculation s. After some discussion with  
HMNZS Taupo , the RCC took back control of the search area . 
2.37 Meanwhile the RCC had tasked the NZ P olice Dive Squad to fly up from Wellington to 
dive on the hull in anticipation of locating the final missing passenger. The Dive Squad 
arrived in the area  by 1953  and prepared  to dive at first light the following morning , 
22 March  2022 .  
2.38 By 2020 all assets on site had been stood down for the evenin g. HMNZS Taupo  had 
marked the hull by attaching a  rope with a  white buoy  earlier in the afternoon. The P3  
recorded the GPS coordinates of the hull before leaving the scene.  
2.39 However, the following morning  the inverted  hull could not be located . A helicopter 
was tasked with searching for the upturned hull. At 1239 the hull was located and the 
vessel with the NZ Police D ive Squad on board was  directed to th at location. The body 
of the last missing passenger was recovered from the hull at 1654 , mark ing the end of 
the search and rescue task. 
Salvage  
2.40 In the days after the completion of the search and rescue task, the inverted hull of the 
Enchanter  was taken under tow , as it was considered a danger to surface navigation . 
 

<< Page 9 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 However , as soon as the tow bega n, the hull rolled back upright  and then sank in 
about 24 metres water depth . 
2.41 The tow vessel then attempted to drag the hull across the seabed into deeper water .10 
However, the manoeuvre was unsuccessful and , according to divers who were on 
board the tow vessel,  the hull sustained significant damage when it was dragged into 
an underwater  rocky  outcrop . Survivors and search and rescue personnel described the 
bottom of the hull as being undamaged before  it sank. 
2.42 On 31 March  2022 , the sunken hull was  raised to the surface and towed to a private 
launching ramp just inside the entrance to Houhora  Harbour. The hull was grounded in 
the mud at high water . When the tide receded , the hull was winched through the mud 
to a point  where the Comm ission was able to  conduct a thorough inspection . (See 
Figure 5 and Appendix 4 for photographs taken during this inspection .) 
 
Figure 5: The Enchanter ’s hull on the beach at Houhora Heads  
 
2.43 Neither  the flybridge from  which three  survivors were rescued nor any of the structure 
that form ed the main saloon and support ed the flybridge was recovered . 
2.44 The suite of navigation equipment located on the flybridge was also lost. A second GPS 
located in the skipper’s cabin was retrieved . Despite having been submerged in salt 
water for several days, the Commission was able to extract data from the memory chip. 
However, the GPS was an older model , so the data was encrypted in a format that 
yielded no useful track coordinates.  
 
10 The wreck was considered to be at a depth where it would be a hazard to recreational divers .

2.46 On the day of the accident the weather situation consisted of  a low-pressure  system , 
which was lying in the Tasman Sea  to the west of North Island  extending a series of 
fronts across Northland . There was a strong northeast flow ahead of these fronts  (see 
Figure  7). 
2.47 The forecast  for the sea area Kaipara issued by MetService at 2248  on 19 March  2022

2.49 The skipper  had access to the MetService information , but primarily relied on the 
PredictWind subscription weather service , specifically the Global Forecast System  
(GFS).11 The skipper frequently monitored th ese resources and concluded that the  
weather forecast was suitable for the fishing charter trip  to proceed . 
2.50 The skipper had previously discussed the weather forecast with the charter group 
organiser. They  acknowledged th e frontal system that was predicted to pass over 
Northland over-night on Saturday 19 March  2022  with associated strong winds and 
rain. They  agreed they had  various option s available should the predicted adverse 
weather eventuate . 
2.51 The weather conditions for the first three days of the trip were  as predicted : fine 
weather with low swell  and little wind. The skipper frequently monitored the weathe r 
forecast  as the trip progressed  and kept the passengers well informed.  On Saturday 
19 March  2022 the skipper noted  that the cold f ront associated with the low pressure 
in the Tasman Sea was still predicted to pass the Three Kings Islands from the

among others, wind . The system couples fo ur separate models  (atmosphere , ocean , land/soil  and sea ice)  to

 northwest early on the morning of  Sunday 20 March  2022 . The  skipper adjusted the 
plan. The Enchanter  remain ed in the sheltered anchorage  until mid -morning  and then , 
as the front was still passing,  they travelled to and fished in the lee of the Princes 
Islands . 
2.52 By 1330 the weather had cleared, the wind had backed12 to approximately north-
northeast13 direction and dropped to 15 to 20 knots . The Enchanter  left the Princes 
Islands  for the six-hour trip to North Cape , essentially following the weather system 
that had passed through . 
2.53 There are no wave -recording devices located in the sea area around North  Cape and 
the Three Kings Islands . The survivor s’ estimates of the wave conditions for the trip 
back were reasonably consistent : about 2.5 metres average at the start and easing to 
about 1.5 metres average as the Enchanter  progressed towards North Cape . (See 
Appendix  1 for a description of wave  formation and characteristics .) 
2.54 The seawater temperature round the North Cape area was about 22 degrees Celsius.  
Vessel information  
2.55 In 1981  the Enchanter  was designed initially as a 14.2-metre  motor sailer bu t before it 
was built the owner altered  the design to a Class X commercial fishing vessel. The 
Enchanter  was built as such in 1 982. The vessel was built  using fibreglass over double -
diagonal kauri plank with a single -deck superstructure  built in marine plywood (no 
flybridge).  
2.56 In 1984 the Enchanter  was modified to be a passenger vessel, and it is thought that a 
semi-open flybridge was added on top of the main saloon at that time .14 
2.57 In 1993  the vessel was lengthened by two metres at the stern.  The Enchanter  was 
purchased by the current owner in 2004 .15 
2.58 In 2009 the vessel was resurveyed to allow it to operate further from the coast,  within  
Coastal16 and Restricted Offshore17 Limits . The flybridge was enclosed with glass 
windows and the helm station  in the main saloon was removed , leaving the  only 
control console located on the flybridge . 
2.59 The Enchanter  had sleeping quarters for eight people in the cabin below and forward 
of the main saloon and for two crew in a cabin behind and below the main saloon.  
2.60 Propulsion was by twin diesel engines giving a service speed of about eight knots .

the world, covering over 30 million square kilometres  (see Figure  8). 
 
 
Figure 8: Map of  the New  Zealand  search and rescue region  
2.62 The coordination of SAR operations for the region is divided into two categories. 
Category I SAR operations are coordinated by NZ Police at a local level , covering 
searches within New Zealand  on land, inland waterways and clos e-to-shore marine 
operations. Category II SAR operations are coordinated at a national level by the RCC. 
These operations typically involve  missing aircraft, aircraft in distress and offshore 
marine operations within New Zealand ’s SAR region.  
2.63 The New Zealand  Search and Rescue Council (NZSAR Council) and the NZSAR 
Secretariat provide  strategic oversight and governance for the SAR sector. The NZSAR 
Council comprises  leaders from the Ministry of Transport , the Civil Aviation Authority ,

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1 The Enchanter ’s hull was well-constructed  and in an apparent good state of repair . 
There is no evidence of any mechanical or equipment failure that could have 
contributed to the accident . 
3.2 Although earlier on the day of the accident the sea conditions in the area had been 
adverse , the skipper had planned to seek shelter  when required and judged the timing 
of the return trip  to North Cape  to coincide with the forecast and observed easing of 
the wind and sea conditions . The general sea conditions in the area off North Cape  at 
the time of the accident should  normally have been well within the capabilities of the 
vessel . 
3.3 The Enchanter  was knocked down by a wave, resulting in the destruction o f its main 
cabin and f lybridge , and total capsize. The accident was initially surviv ed by nine of the 
ten people on board , yet five people tragically died . 
3.4 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the accident  to identify 
those factors  that increased the likelihood of the event occurring . It also discusses  
factors that  increased the severity of the outcome , such as the suitability and 
performance of survival e quipment and the efficiency of the subsequent search and 
rescue response . 
3.5 Other non-contributory safety issues that have the potential to adversely affect future 
operations  are also discussed . 
What happened  
3.6 By the time the Enchanter  was approaching North Cape the sea conditions there had 
moderated with the passing of a cold front over the area from the north. The wind had 
eased and backed20 towards the north . The sea conditions  had eased to an estimated 
1.5 to 2.0 metre  waves . 
3.7 Almost three hours before  the accident the sky had cleared,  and sea conditions had 
eased sufficiently for the skipper  to allow passengers to move around  and open the 
side windows in the main cabin . The lures were also deployed around this time.  
3.8 The Enchanter  was on automatic pilot for the trip to North Cape. The skipper wa s 
navigating  from the flybridge , where  the only helm and control  console were  located . 
The skipper was using a chart plotter21 to navigate. The chart plotter ran a ‘Time Zero’  
charting software  program22. In addition , the standalone radar and depth sounder were 
running. The skipper  told the Commission  there was a planned route  displayed on the 
chart plotter  from their departure point at the Pri nces Island s to the intended 
anchorage behind Murimotu Island  via a series of  waypoint s,23 that, if followed , would 
have taken the Enchanter around Murimotu Island in deep water. The skipper

 described o ne of these waypoints (the ‘turn waypoint’) as being  about 1.4 nautical 
miles off Murimotu  Island  (about 0.8 nautical miles outside the 10  metre depth 
contour ), where the skipper intended to  begin taking  the Enchanter  south . (See 
Figure  11 for a screenshot represen ting the skipper ’s planned  track , taken from another 
company -owned vessel .) The skipper said they were adjusting the autopilot to broadly 
follow this track . If the track was followe d, they would have  kept the vessel  in about  50 
metres water depth  as the Enchanter  closed with the coastline  and reached the turn  
waypoint .24 The skipper was aware that it was risky to pass too close to the coastline 
when sea conditions were adverse, particularly  when the waves were from the 
northeast quarter . 
3.9 In their interview, the skipper indicated that before reaching the turn waypoint,  they 
had begun adjusting  the autopilot to change  course  to ”head down ” (indicating to 
head south ). The skipper later clarified that only one adjustment had been made on 
the autopilot to the south and that was to bring the Enchanter  back on track to the 
turn waypoint . The skipper said that  it was not their intention to begin altering course  
to round Murimotu Island until after the Enchanter had reached the turn waypoint. The 
skipper  place d the location of  the capsize at a point  north -northeast of Murimotu 
Island,  where the Enchanter was still on its planned route and before it reached the 
turn waypo int.

3.10 In the period leading up to the capsize, the skipper had briefly walked to the rear of 
the flybridge to check on the trawls and then returned to the helm  where the chart 
plotter was located.  The skipper was seated there for an undetermined period . It was 
while seated there that the skipper noticed , in the fading light , the “wall of water” 
about to meet  with the vessel from the port side . The time of the accident was

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 approximately  1950 , which was when the first mate had just looked at a mobile phone  
to view a text message . 
3.11 The Commission was not able to establish an accurate track  for the Enchanter  leadi ng 
up to the accident . The main GPS and chart plotter were in  the separated flybridge 
structure , which was not recovered.  The Global star spot-tracking device that had been 
installed by the owner had a habit of dropping offline. It did not transmit position 
reports  for most of the trip from the Pri nces Islands to North Cape, except for five 
occasions, the last two of which were at 1806 and 1906 (about 43 minutes before  the 
accident ).  
3.12 The second GP S unit retrieved from the skipper’s cabin  during the salvage of the hull  
revealed no location data. 
3.13 The skippe r advised the Commission that the accident happened north -northeast of 
the awash rock  near Murimotu  Island in about 50 met res depth of water. This was 
based on the skipper’s perception of where the vessel was , the observation s of water 
depth using the echosounder , that they could see the gap between the mainland and 
Murimotu Island  before  and after the capsize , and the estimated time of a rrival at  the 
anchorage . 
3.14 The Commission has reached a  different  conclusion  from  the skipper  as to the location 
of the accident . The Commission bases its view on an analysis of the EPIRB data , and 
drift modelling conducted by the RCC  (refer to paragraphs  3.23 and 3.24). 
3.15 The Commission acknowledges that the skipper and first mate  recall seeing  the gap 
between Murimotu island and the mainland both before and after the accident . These 
recollections could  give a broad indication of orientation ; however,  they do not give an 
indicat ion of  distance  from the land . The profile of the gap between the island and 
mainland (the outline in the fading light) would be visible across a broad area  including 
the Commission’s calculated area of capsize  (see Figure  12), but that profile would alter 
when viewed from different locations  as the flybridge drifted north . 
The EPIRB  data  
3.16 The Commission engaged an expert in EPIRB data analysis  and functionality  to explain 
the various forms of location data that the Enchanter’s  EPIRB transmitted. See 
Appendix  5 for t he expert report containing a  detailed description of the EPIRB data. 
3.17 The location data received at the RCC from the EP IRB was a combination of three data 
sources : firstly , medium -altitude earth  orbit ing search and rescue (MEOSAR)  satellite  
data; secondly , the encoded Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) location data 
from the internal GPS ; and thirdly , location data from an internal AIS , all transmitted 
directly from the EPIRB . The MEO SAR data is based  on satellites receiving the generic  
406/121 .5-megahertz signal transmitted by the EPIRB . This signal will provide a n initial  
alert to an EPIRB activation followed by an initial location , but its accuracy  is limited . 
The accuracy of the MEOSAR location improves with time and the number of satellites 
passing overhead. For GPS -enabled EPIRBs (such as the one installed on the Enchanter ) 
an internal GPS provide s an encoded position  that is transmitted to the satellite , 
providing RCC with an accurate  location of the EPIRB  to within  an area of certainty of

provided identify  a central position within  a rectangle  measuring 123 metres north to 
south, and 102 metres east t o west.  The EPIRB can be located anywhere within the 
rectangle at the time of transmission . This area of certainty is demonstrated  in

Approximately 30 minutes after capsize, t he first encoded GNSS GPS position  
transmitted by the EPIRB  placed the Enchanter ’s flybridge  within 620 metres  (inclusive 
of the area of certainty ) of Murimotu Island at position  S34 24.864’, E173 03.534’ . The 
estimated area of capsize provided by the  skipper  was approximately 0.91-1.0 nauti cal 
miles east-northeast of this position  (see Figure  12). 
3.18 After t he EPIRB had surfaced , the first mate  made several attempts  to manually activate 
the EPIRB in the dark , before  successful ly activating it between 2015 and 2016 .25. After 
it was activated, it was tied to the floating flybridge. The RCC received the first 
MEOSAR beacon alert at 2017 and the first transmission of the  beacon’s  encoded  GPS 
position  at 2020. In Figure  12 the green track  shows the encoded positions  of the 
EPIRB, and thus the location and drift direction of the flybridge , which the skipper, first 
mate and one passenger were sitting atop.   
3.19 The accuracy of t he encoded GPS positions transmitted by the EPIRB is also confirm ed 
by comparing it with the TracPlus flight data26 from the first responding rescue 
helicopter. During the initial rescue of the three surviving passengers on top of the 
flybridge, the flight data shows the rescue helicopter  hovering  in close vicinity  to the 
encoded position transmitted by the EPIRB at th e same time.  
3.20 Rescue helicopters are equipped with a homing device that helps locat e an activated 
EPIRB in the event the position is not known. On the evening of 20  March  2022 , the 
NEST rescue helicopter crew did not use their homing device . They flew to th e 
flybridge using the encoded GPS position  transmitted by the EPIRB , which w as 
provided to them by RCC, and visually identified the EPIRB by its flashing strobe light. 
This demonstrates  that the encoded GPS position  transmitted by the EPIRB w as 
accurate, as it led the helicopter directly to the scene .

Location of capsize  
3.23 During the SAR operation the RCC w as using drift -modelling software to help 
coordinate the search effort to the most li kely area .28 The drift modelling calculated the 
net drift to be northward at the time and the location of the accident, mainly 
influenced by the tide. High water at North Cape occurred at 2234. With the pending 
change in tide, by 2130 (70 minutes after the  EPIRB activation) the calculated drift 
pattern turned to become easterly ( see Figure  14). 
3.24 Objects in the water will drift in different directions depending on their characteristics. 
A lightweight object floating on the surface is more likely to be influen ced by the wind 
and surface wave action, whereas objects floating deeper in the water will more likely 
be influenced by the tide and current. This phenomenon was observed during the SAR 
operation. The hull of the upturned vessel drifted more in a southerly  direction. What is 
thought to have been a strobe light attached to a lifebuoy appeared to the survivors, 
relative to their own drift rate, to be drifting closer to the shoreline under the influence 
of the wind. The drift rate of the mostly submerged flybr idge was accurately tracked by 
the EPIRB that was attached to it. The RCC drift modelling is consistent with the 
observed track of the EPIRB once it had been activated, which was initially northward 
and then turned east.  
3.25 Using the encoded positions transmitted by the EPIRB, the initial drift of the flybridge 
was northward at about 0.14 knots. Taking into consideration the encoded positions 
area of certainty, as shown by the green rectangles in Figure 12, the EPIRB’s rate o f 
drift was between about 0.06 to 0.17 knots.  
 
28 The current data is obtained via an Environmental Data Server (based at the RPS group in Australia) that 
receives data from various sources globally. The data shown in this model was sourced from MetOceans 
Solutions and incorporates the MetOcean drift current forecasting with an underlying RPS tidal model.  It is the 
most accurate hydrodynamic current model available for coastal New Zealand within the SARMAP  system .

Figure 14: Combined tide and current drift modelling for 20 minutes before the accident (top) 
and 100 minutes after (bottom) , conducted by the RCC during the SAR operation  
3.26 When considering all the factors that could affect the drift of the flybridge, the 
Commission concluded it was about as likely as not  that its rate and direction of drift 
after the EPIRB  had been activated was  similar to the 30 minutes prior to the EPIRB  
being activated  (noting the EPIRB was attached to the flybridge) .  Therefore, it is about 
as likely  as not that the location of the capsize would have been within an area about 
0.07 nautical miles (about 130 metres) south of the first encoded position, as s hown in 
Figure 12.  
3.27 Both the first GNSS position transmitted by the EPIRB and this calculated  area of 
capsize were within  the 10  metre depth contour  as shown in Figure  13.  
3.28 These shallower water depths correlate more closely  with the descri ption of the  wave  
that caused the Enchanter  to capsize . This is discussed in more detail in the following 
section  on weather and wave theory .  

 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 24 >>
 3.29 As stated previously, the skipper’s estimate of capsize location is approximately 0.91 to 
1 nautical mile  from where the EPIRB was activated. While this scenario was considered , 
the mostly submerged flybridge would need to have travel led that distance in 
30 minutes, being driven by the current at an average rate of 1.8 to 2 knots in an 
opposing direction to t he drift modelling provided by the RCC as well as the drift of 
the EPIRB post activation . The Commission consider s this unlikely  given the local 
conditions at the time of the accident . 
3.30 The skipper ’s estimated location of capsize is in  a similar location to  where  the 
flybridge was located by  the NEST rescue helicopter  using the EPIRB ’s encoded 
position , four hours later. For the skipper’s capsize location to be correct, there would 
have had to have  either  been little to no  drift in the four-hour period between the 
capsize and rescue, or the direction of drift  would have  had to reverse  after the EPIRB  
was activated , taking  the flybridge back out to where the skipper estimated the capsize 
occurred. Neither hypothesis is consistent with the RCC drift modelling , which broadly 
correlated with the observed  track of the EPIRB after it had been activat ed. 
3.31 Weather systems can affect local conditions  such as the direction and velocity of 
surface current s. The underwater topography can add a level of complexity to the 
various tides and currents if near shore. These factors  add an element of  uncertainty to 
any backdrift analysis . Reliable data source s recording  such local conditions  at North 
Cape do not exis t. Therefore , to determine the approximate drift rate of the flybridge 
after EPIRB activation and the area of capsize, the Commission has  used time and 
distance calculations based on  the only reliable data  available, the  EPIRB transmissions , 
as these trans missions  most accurately reflect  the a pproximate  drift rate of the 
flybridge after EPIRB  activation.   
3.32 Given the distance between the position of the EPIR B activation and the estimated 
capsize position provided by the skipper, the storm system would have need ed to 
produce a current in excess of 2 knots opposing the predicted  northern tidal flow , 
which  is not supported by the initial  drift pattern of the EPIRB.  
3.33 The Commission has not been able to establish the reason for the disparity between  
where the skipper estimated the capsize happened in deep water , and where the 
encoded EPIRB data indicates  the capsize occurred  inshore in shallower  water .  
Weather and wave theory  
3.34 The forecast for the sea area Brett (see Figure  6) for Sunday 20 March  2022  was for 
rough seas and a northeast swell rising to 2 metres  ahead of  a frontal weather system 
passing over the area from the North.  The only actual recording s of the sea state in the 
general area w ere from two waverider buoys29. One was a wave  spotter buoy30 which 
had been drifting above North Cape from 17 to 24  March  2022 . The other was  a 
Northland Regional Council waverider buoy located off the P urerua Peni nsular near the 
Bay of Islands, some 70 nautical miles southeast of North Cape  and some 120 nautical 
miles southeast of the Three Kings  Islands . The data from the Northland Regional 
Council waverider buoy  is considered more representative of the general conditions of f 
Murimotu Island as it was not affected  by the weather pattern  off the west coast of 
North Island .

30 A drifting wave rider buoy . 
 

<< Page 25 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 3.35 On the day of the accident the wave spotter buoy  had generally drifted in a westerly 
direction . At 1420 the buoy was located approximately 15 nautical miles northwest of 
Murimotu Island, recording a  peak significant  wave height31 of 4.2 metres with a 
period32 of about 8 seconds.  By 1910 the buoy had drifted west to within 3 nautical 
miles of Cape Reinga recording significant  wave heights of 3.2 metre s, broadly 
demonstrating that conditions had started to ease during th e Enchanter’s  voyage to 
North Cape . 
3.36 The Northland Regional Council  waverider buoy  recorded a peak in significant 
combined (wind and swell ) wave  height of  about 4 met res with an average period of 7  
seconds33 between 1300 and 1400 on the day of the accident. The maximum recorded 
wave  height  for the same period  was about 6 met res. These peaks coincide with the 
passing  of the same front al system that had passed over the Three Kings Islands earlier 
that morning. They also coincided with the time that the Enchanter  departed the Three 
Kings  Islands . By 2000  (about the time of the accident ) the significant wave  height off 
the Bay of Islands had fallen to 2.7 metres, with a m aximum wave height of 4.3 met res. 
The wave height at North Cape had likely decreased more, being 70 nautical miles 
further northwest of the weather system.  
3.37 Observers noted the presence of a smaller secondary swell coming from a southeast 
direction (head -on to the Enchanter ’s direction). This secondary swell was considered 
much smaller than the main waves coming from the northeast sector. Waves  from 
different directions can combine to form larger peaks and troughs . 
3.38 Survivors from the Enchanter  estimated the main wave heights were in the range of 1.5 
to 2 met res34 off North Cape at the time of the accident. These estimates broadly 
correlate with  the wave heights  recorded off the Bay of Islands  as the frontal system 
moved further south and the winds eased .  
3.39 For a significant wave height of 2 met res in deep water , mariners can expect at least 
one in every 3 ,000 waves (or 3 every 24 hours ) to reach 4 met res, twice the significant 
wave  height  (see Appendix  1 for more detail on wave formation and characteristics ). In 
deep water a wave of this size should not pose a threat to a vessel of the Enchanter ’s 
size, construction  and stability . 
3.40 The amount of energy a wav e possesses is representative of its height a nd length . If a 
wave enters shallow water , its wavelength35 decreases with a consequential increase in 
height while maintaining the same energy . When waves  reach water depths  less than 
half of their wavelength , they interact with the seabed , causing them to slow, rise and 
steepen  (referred to as peak ing). The waves  eventually break  as the water depth 
decrease s further  to about 1/20th of its wavelength . 
3.41 Therefore, w aves with a longer wavelength will interact with the seabed earlier, than 
those with a shorter wavelength. Within a spectrum the waves will vary  in height and 
length  and thus energy . The average period of the waves recorded on the waverider 
buoy was about 7 seconds. For normal deep -water waves with a 7 -second period their 
wavelength is calculated to be about 76 metres. Such waves would begin to interact

32 The time it takes two successive wave crests  to pass a specified point.  
33 The wave peri od created by this weather system , in deep water , is unlikely to  change significantly over the 70 
nautical miles  between the waverider buoy and the accident area.  
34 These obs ervations are likely based on what they  were seeing, rather than a significant wave height.

 with the seabed and start to peak at a depth of 38 metres. The shallower the water 
gets, the more they wi ll peak until they begin to break at a water depth of about 4 
metres.  
3.42 Only one survivor saw the wave approaching  and was able to give a detailed  
description of the wave that capsized the Enchanter . That survivor was a passenger  
sitting out on the aft fishi ng deck  observing the trawling lures  at the time . That 
passenger described seeing a ‘larger wave ’ approaching from the port side  from the 
same direction as the prevailing swell . This wave’s  form did not initially cause concern , 
but t hen as the wave neared the vessel it appeared to rise into a near -vertical wall . This 
observation is consistent with a wave peaking as it  enter s shallow water.  
3.43 The underwater topography  off Murimotu  Island matches the wave performance 
observ ed by the passenger. From seaward , the seabed off Murimotu  Island slopes 
steeply from 50 to 10 metres water depth over 0.7 nautical miles (1300 met res). The 
seabed  slopes very steeply  from 30 to 2 metres water depth ( see Figure  15). To the 
observer on the Enchanter ’s aft deck a larger  wave would have begun  visibly peaking in 
the distance,  with a sharp rise when the wave met with the 10-metre  contour .  
3.44 This analysis of the wave form supports the hypothesis founded on  the EPIRB data , that 
the capsize occurred much closer i nshore and in shallow er water  than estimated by the 
skipper.  
3.45 Consideration was given by the Commission  to whether the formation of what has 
been  referred to as a ‘ rogue wave’ was a factor in the capsize. In recent decades 
scientists have accepted t he concept of rogue waves. The United States National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration refers to rogue waves as those  that are large, 
unexpected and dangerous ; are nominally greater than twice the significant wave 
height ; are very unpredictable; and often come from directions other than the 
prevailing wind  and waves. 36 Because these waves are uncommon, measurement and 
analysis  of this phenomenon is rare .37 
3.46 As mentioned above, a wave within the spectrum of the significant wave height 
present off North Cape could , in less than 10 metre water depth , cause the capsize and 
damage that occurred to the Enchanter . So too would an even larger wave.  Therefore, 
determining w hether the wave that capsized the Enchanter  was within or higher than 
the spectrum of significant wave height in the area is of little relevance  because either 
could have caused the vessel to capsize  in less than 10 metre water  depth . 
3.47 Regardless of where and how the vessel capsized, this accident raises significant safety 
issues about preparing for and increasing  chances of surviving such an accident. We 
discuss these safety issues in the following sections .

Vessel s tability  and construction  
3.48 When a vessel is knocked  down by a wave and capsizes , its stability and construction  
are factors to consider.  The Enchanter  was resurveyed for restricted offshore  limits  in 
2009 . Then  it underwent a n inclining experiment38 and stability assessment to ensure it 
complied with the requirements of Mari time Rule s Part 40C  (Rules Part 40C)39. The 
Enchanter ’s stability characteristics well exceeded the minimum requirements of Rule s 
Part 40C. However, compliance with Rule s Part 40C is no guarantee against a vessel 
capsizing. The Enchanter ’s stability manual included the following warning to the 
master:  
Safety I nformation  – Compliance with stability and freeboard criteria required under 
Maritime Rule [s] 40C does not ensure avoidance of capsizing regardless of the 
circumstances. It is the master’s responsibility to execute prudence and good seamanship 
with due reg ard to weather forecasts, navigation zone, speed, headings, load distribution 
and watertight integrity, so the vessel is operating in the safest mode possible against the 
prevailing conditions at all times.  
3.49 The stability analysis process involved modelling the form of the hu ll’s watertight 
boundary  and calculating certain cr iteria for comparison with those required under 
Rules Part 40C . The watertight bou ndary included the spaces below the Enchanter ’s 
main  deck and the raised foredeck ( see Figure  16). It did not include the superstructure , 
comprising the main saloon , galley  and flybridge .

Figure 16: Extract from the Enchanter’s stability manual showing the modelled  
watertight boundary  
 
3.50 The modelled boundary was not watertight in the true sense of the word. Inside the 
main saloon there were openings leading to the sleeping quarters under the foredeck , 
the engine room , and the crew ’s accommodation aft , all of which would  allow down -
flooding40 to occur should water enter the main saloon or , as in this instance , if the 
entire superstructure was lost when the vessel was knocked down.  
3.51 The naval architect co nducting the stability analysis explained that the basis for 
considering the hull as watertight was that these openings would remain above the 
waterline when the vessel was heeled to its maximum angle before losing positive 
stability . The three main openings through which down -flooding could occur  were all 
located around  the centreline of the vessel and  were calculated to be well above the 
waterline if the vessel were  floating  on its side  (see Figure  17). 
3.52 Statical stability is the ability of a vessel to return upri ght after removal of an external 
factor which caused the vessel to heel  (in static or calm water) . The Enchanter , when 
loaded as it typically would be nearing the end of a voyage , could heel over to an 
angle of about 77 degrees  before it lost positive stability  (often referred to as the point 
of vanishing stability) . At this point the risk of capsize would be high, based on statical 
stability .41 However, a vessel ’s ability to return upright when heeled by wind and/or 
waves  at large angles of heel is not linear  – it changes as the vessel progressively rolls. 
Therefore , a vessel’s dynamic stability  is also assessed  as part of the stability analysis . 
Dynamic stability in this context  is the vessel’s overall resistance to being pushed over 
in response to wav es and reaching that point of vanishing stability  (see Appendix 2 for 
more detail on stability) . 
3.53 A vessel with low dynamic stability is easily rolled past the point where it loses stability. 
A vessel with high dynamic stability will take a l ot more wave energy to reach that 
point. The Enchanter  had relatively high dynamic stability, easily exceeding the 
minimum requirements of Rules Part 40C.

3.54 From the  surviv ors’ accounts the Enchanter ’s final roll to starboard  was rapid . The wave 
that struck the vessel had sufficient energy to roll the vessel immediately on to  its side 
with sufficient force to implode the windows and structure forming  the main saloon . 
Wave energy of this magnitude  is generated  as much from the wave’s steepness and 
profile as its size . 
3.55 The Enchanter ’s superstructure appears to h ave offered little resistance to the capsizing 
energy of the wave . Within seconds the entire superstructure  separated from the hull. 
This allowed water to down -flood  into the ‘water tight’  hull through the internal 
opening s, thus contributing to  the total capsize.  
3.56 The flybridge separated from what had been the supporting structure beneath it – the 
four bulkheads42 of the main saloon  including  all windows . The flybridge was 
discovered floating upside down close to the capsized hull . It was this structure that 
three  of the survivors climbed onto, from which the y were later rescued  (see Figure  18).

3.57 Post-salvage inspection confirmed that the separation of the superstructure from the 
hull was not because of poor maintenance . The timber  around this connection  was in 
good condition and the method of connection was generally  in accordance with the 
standards of wooden boat building for the era of build.  The wooden material ha d 
failed from simple overload . Figure  19 shows the Enchanter  after it had been salvaged . 
Note the total absence of the main superstructure  (see Appendix  4 for detail s of the 
post-salvage inspection .)

3.58 We now consider whether the outcome would have been different if the superstructu re 
had been strong enough to withstand the initial knock  down by the wave . If the 
superstructure  had remained intact , it is about as likely as not  that the vessel would 
not hav e capsized immediately. With the vessel floating on its side , part of the

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 superstructure would have provided buoyancy and thus  contributed to the dynamic 
stability of the vessel  (see Figure 17). It is not possible to say definitively whether it 
would still have eventually capsized . That would depend on whether the vessel righted 
itself with  successive waves  and what openings there were in the superstructure  to 
allow seawater to invade the saloon space – for example, open windows and the main  
rear door.  
3.59 Nine of the ten people on board escaped to the water  alive. It is likely  that t he person  
trapped in the forward sleeping quarters would have had a better chance of survival  if 
the superstructure had remained intact . If the vessel had remained floating upright or 
on its side, the chance of survivors having access to the various life -saving aids would 
have been significantly improved.  Three  people who were known to have survived the 
initial capsize were  later found deceased . Survivability was likely  affected by swim 
failure . Having access to life  jackets  or a life raft  would have reduced the onset of swim 
failure.  
3.60 It would not be practic able to require  superstructures  on all vessels  be able to  
withstand the vessel be ing knocked down by a wave . A vessel is built to a certain 
specification for a particular purpose . Its intended purpose will determine its design  
and what standards it must meet, if any. Some are built as rec reational vessels , in which 
case their design is often  specified by the owner . Some are built to a standard hull 
design , but the superstructure and fitout is varied at the owner ’s request. Other s (for 
example, a tug) are designed for a specific purpose . 
3.61 Vessels  often change ownership several times during  their life and consequently their 
purpose often changes . Commercial vessels are required to be surveyed . If their 
purpose changes , they must undergo a survey to determine whether they are fit for 
their new intended purpose.   
3.62 The variation  in vessel design and purpose is therefore infinite. It would  not be 
practicab le to have  one standard applicable to  all vessels.  
3.63 The Enchanter ’s purpose changed several times over the life of the vessel. Each time it 
was res urveyed and deemed fit for that purpose. T he Enchanter  was originally built for 
a private owner  to a standard Haag design and method of construction . It was initially 
designed as a motorsail er, then a Class IV launch, and ultimately was built as  a Class X 
fishing vessel .43 Two years later in 1984 it was modified to carry passengers . Nine years 
later in 1993 t he Enchanter  was lengthened by two met res. It changed ownership  
several times  (exactly how many is undetermined) . It was in commercial operation as a 
charter sport -fishing vessel when the  curren t owner purchased the vessel  in 2004 . 
Under its current ownership  it was resurveyed , enabling it to operate further offshore . 
The changes required to achieve th ese new limits – an upgrade to the eq uipment to be 
carried and a stability assessment – mainly related to how far from assistance  it could  
be if an incident  occurred .  
3.64 Charter sport -fishing vessel s are not required  to withstand a knock  down  or capsize 
but are required to have adequate stability to reduce the likelihood  of such a n 
occurrence . Ocean -going yacht s on the other hand are usually designed with minimal  
superstructure  which  is stronger  and can easily be made watertight  as they are more 
susceptible  to being knocked down  by wind  alone . The Enchanter  had been 
repurposed  to accommodate passengers on multi -day fishing charters.  Its survival  
 
43 These classifications refer to  the standards applicable at that time  
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 32 >>
 relied on  its inherent stability and  being operated at appropriate time s and place s, in 
suitable  weather condition s and in an appropriate manner , as emphasised by the note 
to masters in the vessel’s stability manual .  
3.65 In that context , the skipper had taken shelter until the adverse weather system had 
passed over the area . The residual  sea con ditions for the trip from the Three Kings 
Islands  to North Cape  should have been  within the Enchanter ’s capabilities . However, 
the vessel’s stability and structural resilience would have been tested  under the 
prevailing conditions if operated in shallow er waters where steep breaking waves were 
more likely to occur  and capsize the vessel.  
3.66 Under similar circumstances  a more modern vessel of the same design  and built from 
contemporary mat erials would be  less likely to suffer  the same degree of destruction . 
However , that does not assume  the Enchanter  was not  fit for its intended purpose, 
provided it was operated  in accordance with it s Marine Transport Operators Plan.  A 
vessel’s survival is never reliant on the quality of its design and build  alone , nor only on 
the way it is operated. It will always be a combination of both.  
 
Survivability  
Safety Issue : Maritime New Zealand ’s system for auditing and assessing the perform ance of 
accredited vessel surveyors is not ensuring they are interpreting and applying maritime rules 
correctly  when surveying vessels.  
3.67 The Enchanter  carried on board a variety of life-saving apparatus  for the purpose of 
reducing the consequences of an accident  by improving survivability . The purpose of 
each  apparatus falls into three broad categories : 
1. to aid in people ’s survival  if they are required to abandon the vessel or the vessel is 
lost through a catastrophic event  
2. to alert potential responders to the even t 
3. to assist responders in locating and rescu ing the people .  
3.68 The Enchanter  was required to meet the standards set out in Rules Part 40C for non -
passenger vessels that do not have to comply with SOLAS44 standards . Appendix 3 of 
Rules Part 40C outlines the required standards for life -saving equipment onboard.  
Life jacket s 
Safety Issue : New Zealand  maritime rules do not adequately address  the need for proper 
stowage of life jackets on board passenger vesse ls so that  passengers have access to a life 
jacket  in the event of a sudden catastrophic event.  
3.69 Regardless of what other life -saving apparatus is carried on board , people will 
inevitably  spend time in the water  if a vessel is lost or abandoned . Life jacket s45 are 
fundamental to survival in the water. As well as providing flotation , the type  of life 
jacket  provide d on the Enchanter  was designed to aid detection by searchers through 
their bright orange colour,  reflective tape , whistle and a self -activating light . Life jacket s

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 reduce the onset of swim failure  by supporting the person in the water . They also slow  
any onset of hypothermia  by allowing the wearer to ‘huddle ’ instead of swimming , 
thereby reduc ing the loss of body heat . 
3.70 The Enchanter  had life jacket s on board for 30 people46. All 30 life jackets were stowed 
under the bunks in the forward passenger cabin . When the sudden capsize occurred  
nobody had time to access  the life jacket s. Consequently , none  of the  nine people who 
initially survived the capsize  was wearing a life jacket . 
3.71 Of the five people who lost their lives, one is thought to have died almost immediately  
in the cabin  and another soon after entering the water. For the remaining three it is not 
possibl e to determine how long they survived before succumbing. One chanced on  a 
lifebuoy  and was later found  deceased  still wearing it. Little is known about the 
remaining two . All pass engers and crew sustained injuries of some degree during the 
initial knock  down and escape from the hull. Some of t he injuries  to those who lost 
their lives  would have hampered their ability  to swim . Some had pre -existing medical 
conditions that could also have hampered their ability to survive unassisted in the 
water . Both factors likely contribute d to earlier  swim failure , something a life jacket  
would have helped to prevent.  
3.72 Standard offshore life jacket s are bulky . Storage on board smaller vessel s capable of 
carrying many people is problematic . However, operators should make all efforts to 
spread the life jacket s across  several locations to increase the likelihood of people 
access ing them when needed . On the Enchanter , no more than 10 people could be  
carried on  coastal and offshore  trips. Ten life jacket s could have been stowed in more 
accessible locations around the vessel . This would have been a reasonable way to 
manage the foreseeable risk  of a sudden event . The Commission has made  a 
recommendation  to the Director of Maritime New Zealand  to address this safety 
issue.  
3.73 Having access to a life jacket  is important ; so too is being able to put it on quickly  in an 
emergency. The Enchanter ’s passengers were told the location of the life jacket s during 
a safety briefing before departing Mangōnui . However, they were not shown what one 
looked like and did not practi se putting one on . The method of putting on and 
securing life jacket s differs between types and manufacturers  and not everyone is 
familiar with the practi ce. In an emergency and in the dark  is not the time to be 
acquiring these skills . Although there was no opportunity to access life jacket s on this 
occasion, the re may well be under different circumstances , particularly if they are made 
more readily accessible.  Skipper s ensuring that passengers are familiar with and 
practi sed at putting on a life jacket  is a key safety lesson  arising from this inquiry.  
3.74 Not directly relevant to this accident , but important nevertheless,  is the issue of when 
people should wear a life jacket  or other personal flotation device s. Under normal 
circumstances it wouldn’t be considered necessary to wear one when occupying the 
internal spaces of a vessel of the Enchanter ’s size and construction.  
3.75 However, it is evident th at on these coastal and offshore  charters , fishing for large 
species occurs on the open deck  when conditions are not calm. The risk of someone 
falling overboard  deserves  consider ation . SOLAS life jacket s would not be suitable for 
this type of activity  due to their bulk  and the risk of them becoming damaged . 
However, fully compliant inflatable life jacket s are available that would not compromise 
 
46 The vessel was approved to carry 28 passengers when operati ng within Inshore Limits.  
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 34 >>
 the activity.  On the Enchanter there was no requirement to wear a life jacket  of any sort 
when on the  open deck, and none were supplied by the skipper.  Lifebuoy s were 
available on either side of the Enchanter  to throw to someone who may have fallen 
overboard . However, these take time to deploy and there is no guarantee that they will 
reach a non -swimmer i n the water in time , particularly if the vessel is trawling at the 
time.  While not a maritime rule requirement, skippers should consider having and 
enforcing a policy that covers when passengers must wear a life jacket  and should 
make them available.  
Life raft s 
3.76 Life raft s too are important for survival . They offer a  more effective solution than life 
jacket s, particularly in situations where  the time before  rescue may be longer . Life raft s 
offer  a sheltered haven free from immersion in  water , all but nega ting the risk of swim 
failure  and h ypothermia . 
3.77 It is uncertain what  happened to the Enchanter ’s life raft s. They were not recovered and 
there is no  evidence of them having deployed. Th ere were two life rafts secured by a 
hydrostatic rel ease47 to the aft deck of the flybridge . The deck of the flybridge was the 
platform to which  three of the survivors were  clingi ng when rescued . This flybridge 
structure was also not recovered.  
3.78 The hydrostatic release  is designed to activate and release the life rafts if they reach a 
water depth of between 1.5 and 4 met res. If the vessel were to sink, the life rafts would 
release , float to the surface and inflate.  However, the  flybridge broke free from the hull 
and remained afloat. It is feasi ble that the life raft s never reached water depths of more 
than 1.5 metres during the capsize sequence  and thus remained attached to the 
underside of the platform that the survivors were clinging to . If that was the case  the 
survivors could  have , in hindsight,  reached under and manually released the life rafts.  
3.79 Because the vessel was classed to operate in Coastal and Restricted Offshore limits, 
maritime rules48 required that the two life raft s on board  the Enchanter  be SOLAS -type 
rafts. However, surve y records show that both life rafts were of the non-SOLAS  type 
(see Figure  20). This non-compliance  had gone undetected by successive surveyors for 
several  years . Although not directly relevant to this accident ( because the life raft s were 
never deployed) , the non-compliance  is of concern. The difference between SOLAS and 
non-SOLAS life rafts relates mainly to the way they are constructed , the amount of 
insulation  from temperature extremes the raft s must provide , and equipment available 
for longer -range  SAR assets to detect  the raft . 
3.80 The Commission has made a recommendation  to the Director of Maritime 
New Zealand  to implement a formal system of notifying surveyors of current and 
emerging changes to maritime rules for the construction, mainten ance and surveying 
of vessel s, and provid e clarification where needed of the intent and application of 
maritime rules .

Lifebuoy s 
3.81 Like life jacket s, lifebuoy s serve two purposes : they provide flotation and aid detection 
by searchers through their bright orange colour , retro -reflective49 tape and, in some 
cases,  a self -activating light.  They should be f itted with a grabline to aid retrieva l and 
to facilitate support for more than one person . Some are fitted with a buoyant line to 
enable them to be secured to other floating items  or to enable someone to be pulled 
towards a vessel  in the case of a person overboard . 
3.82 The Enchanter  was equipped with four lifebuoy s. One was located either side of the 
flybridge , and the other two  on top of the flybridge roof (see Figure  21). 
3.83 According to Appendix 3 of Rules Part 40C ,50 all four were required to be fitted with a 
grabline. Two were required to be fitted with a self -igniting strobe light  and two with 
an additional length of buoyant line.  
3.84 Section 52 (2) of Rule s Part 40C  require s all life -saving appliances to meet the 
perfor mance standards pre scribed in Maritime Rule s Part 42A  (Rules Part 42A)51.

 3.85 All four life buoys on the Enchanter  were therefore required to be fitted with retro -
reflective tape.  
3.86 The two lifebuoy s fitted either side of the flybridge had self-igniting strobe lights and 
all four had additional buoyant lines. However , possibly only one  was fitted with a grab 
line, two did not have retro -reflective tape and two had the remnants of retro -
reflective tape that was so deteri orated as to be ineffective .53 As with the non -
compliant life raft s, these non-compliances  had gone undetected by successive 
surveyors for several years . While this omission alone cannot be considered evidence 
of a wider issue with the s tandard of surveying , the Commissio n has made a 
recommendation  to Maritime New Zealand to ensure it has an adequate system for 
monitoring the standards of marine surveying.  Retro -reflective tape is an important  
feature  of life-saving  equipment . It aids in the detection of survival equipment and 
people in water , particularly at night . 
3.87 Shortly after the  Enchanter  capsized , survivors noted  one of the  passenger s in the 
water with a lifebuoy . The passenger  had placed  the lifebuoy  over their head and 
under the ir arm pits . After the five survivors had been rescued from atop the hull and 
flybridge , the second helicopter on scene searched the area in the dark without success 
for an hour and 25 minutes until it ran short o f fuel and returned to the forward 
command post . The same passenger was found shortly after sunrise when , after 
refueling,  the helicopter resumed on task 4.7 hours later . The passenger was found 
deceased but still in the  lifebuoy . 
3.88 Rescue personel who recovered the passenger from the lifebuoy  noted its  poor 
condition , having no retro -reflective tape.  The air crew commented on how retro -
reflective tape stands out “like a beacon ” when using  night -vision goggles , even 
without direct contact from a search light.  
3.89 It cannot be said for certain  that the people in the water would have been detected 
during the helicopter night search before they suc cumbed. However, their chances of 
detection would have been significantly better had the various life -saving apparatus 
been available and been appropri ately fitted with the required light sources and retro -
reflective tape.

Emergency Position -Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB)  
3.90 An EPIRB is critical for  quickly and accurately  alerting  authorities  to an emergency  
situation . They come in a variety of sizes and forms . There were two EPIRBs on the 
Enchanter . The main unit was required to be float -free and automatically activate if 
submerged . It was an upgrade requirement when the Enchanter  was resurveyed for 
limited offshore  operations. The owner had kept the original EPIRB on board as a 
backup  to the main one. This older unit was  stowed on a bracket in the main saloon . It 
was not of the flo at-free type and had to be manually activated. Th is backup  EPIRB was 
lost together with the debris of the  main saloon . 
3.91 The main EPIRB was the unit that fortuitously surfaced next to the skipper soon after 
escaping the inverted flybridge . It had been stored  in its float -free enclosure  next to 
the float -free life raft s at the rear of the flybridge . Like the life raft s it was designed to 
release from its enclosure  and float to the surface when submerged to a depth 
between 1.5  and 4 met res (see Figure  22). 
3.92 The life raft s did not float  free, but the EPIRB did . However, after it had floated free, the 
EPIRB did not activate automatically as designed . The EPIRB manufacturer was unable 
to explain why it did not automatically activate , other than the possibility of  a fault in 
the switching mechanism. They report that they had no record of the switch having

 failed previously. Once the EPIRB was manually switched on it per formed as designed . 
The fact that it did not automatically activate is of concern. Had it not surfaced right 
next to the skipper, it may never have activated, which would have significantly delayed 
the start of the search and rescue response . 
    
Figure 22: EPIRB automatic release sequence  
(Source : McMurdo EPIRB user manual)  
3.93 The failure of the EPIRB to automatically activate highlights the importance of having 
multiple means of raising the alarm and for authori ties to have access to a vessel ’s 
track history  if it is reported overdue.  As said , EPIRBs  come in a variety of types and 
sizes. Personal locator beacons can provide a useful backup  to other alerting systems. 
They are relatively inexpensive and small enough to fit in a pocket.  While not as robust 
as the larger commercial type -approved EPIRBs, they may well save lives following  a 
rapid and catastrophic event in which the commercial systems prove ineffective in the 
circumstances , such as the Enchanter  accident  (safety lesson ).  
Vessel -tracking systems  
Safety issue : There is no requirement for commercial vessels that carry passengers to be 
fitted with any form o f tracking device such as an automatic identification system ( AIS) or 
other commercially availab le tracking systems.  
3.94 The owner of Enchanter  Fishing Charters had installed the Globalstar spot -tracking 
device on all three of its vessels. The system was primarily to allow the owner /skipper ’s 
partner at the shore base to track where the three vessels were . The system worked 
most of the time , but the transmitter unit on the Enchanter  did drop offline from time 
to time and required resetting.  Consequently , the system was of little use to the RCC 
when coordinating the search and rescue. Had the ma in EPIRB been lost and not 
manually activated by the survivors, the Enchanter 's plight may not have been truly 
understood for several  hours. It would have taken longer  for a search and rescue effort 
to begin  based only on the Enchanter ’s missed check call with Far North Radio . 

 

<< Page 39 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 3.95 An AIS uses transponders to transmit real -time data about a vessel ’s identity, position 
and movement , either directly from the vessel to another  VHF transceiver or via 
satellite.  This data is recorded and can be retrieved by the RCC to he lp establish a 
vessel’s position and status  or, as in this case , the last known position.  
3.96 The system was initially introduced worldwide to assist in collision avoidance but its 
worth as a search and rescue t ool and a marine traffic control system was soon realised 
and these have  become its primary use s over time . Currently, only international SOLAS 
ships and certain classes of domestic ships are required to be fitted with AIS . Currently, 
vessels such as the Enchanter  are not required to have it fitted.  
3.97 In the Commission’s view there is significant benefit in requiring certain classes (like 
passenger -carrying vessels ) to be fitted with AIS . The safety benefits are likely to far 
outweigh the minimal cost . Using  the Enchanter  case as an  example, if an EPIRB had 
not been activated and the system was reliant on an overdue check call  to raise the 
alarm, retrieving the AIS data for the Enchanter  (had one been fitted) would have led 
searchers directly to where the signal was lost , which would  be where the capsize 
occurred . 
3.98 In 2015 t he Commission published the Technologies to Track and to Locate  watchlist 
item,54 in which  the Commission suggested  that transport regulators encourage and , 
where reasonable , require operators of transport vehicles to use tracking and location 
technologies.  
3.99 In the maritime context the watchlist item draws on two fatal maritime accidents, the 
circumstances of which are no t too dissimilar to the Enchanter  accident ,55 In both cases 
the consequences of each accident could have been reduced had tracking 
technologies such as an EPIRB or AIS been available.  No recommendations were made 
in either of these reports to mandate the installation  of AIS on these small commercial 
vessels because having it would not necessarily alert authorities that an accident had 
occurred . 
3.100  However, we now recognise the potential benefit of AIS as a SAR tool to guide 
searchers directly to t he scene (as an EPIRB would  when activated ), particularly with the 
increased use of satellite -based AIS and the much broader coverage  around the coast 
that it affords.  AIS units have also become much smaller and cheaper to install. They 
are increasingly be ing installed on smaller commercial and recreational craft.  
3.101  The Commission has made a recommendation  to the Director of Maritime 
New Zealand  to mandate the installation of AIS on certain categories of vessels, with a 
focus on those that present a higher ri sk – those that carry passengers outside inshore 
limits.

 Search and rescue  
Safety Issue: New Zealand  does not have readily  available  and suitable resources that can be 
assigned to search and rescue operations in the following operational areas:  
• helicopters that are fully equipped and crewed for extended SAR operations across 
New Zealand  and its coastal waters  
• medium -range fixed -wing aircra ft designed, equipped and crewed for SAR operations 
across New Zealand  coastal waters and the exclusive economic zone ( EEZ) 
• vessels that are designed, equipped and manned by crew practi sed at conduct ing SAR 
operations out to offshore limits . 
 
Safety Issue : There is currently no dedicated program me that requires  organisations that 
operate SAR assets and might routinely be assigned on -scene coordinator status to engage in 
joint training with the RCC to ensure consistency in knowledge of the SAR framework and 
terminology.  
3.102  It is generally accepted  that no two SAR operations are the sam e, making it difficult to 
follow a single standard SAR procedure . Consequently, there are almost always new 
lessons arising out of every SAR operation that can be applied to continuously improve 
future SAR operations. The following analysis should be read in that context.  
3.103  In New Zealand , coordinating SAR events  is made more difficult because  there are few 
readily  available  air and surface assets fit for extended SAR operations , particularly for 
remote areas . There is also a shortage of people trained to common standards to crew 
those assets . 
3.104  If these two issues were remedied , then SAR operations could be streamlined , more 
efficient and therefore more effective . There may be opportunities  to do so if synergies 
between potential multiple -user agencies  were to be explored . We discuss this in 
relation to each sector in the following section . First though, there  needs to  be an 
acknowledgement  of the RCC’s performance in managing the challenging  Enchanter  
SAR operation  and that of the various participating parties . Whilst  there are some 
lessons arising from the operation, th ese need to be taken in context of the current 
structure of the SAR system and the challenges th is can pose for the various  
partic ipants . 
3.105  The NEST helicopter based at  Whangarei was the first asset to be task ed.56 NEST 
prepared the aircraft and assembled its crew based on what they had been told. They 
assumed the worst case and took the time to prepare accordingly. It is generally 
acknowledged that locating and winching people from the water into a helicopter in 
the dark  during  inclement weather  is a high -risk activity. This rescue  of the survivors  
was probably on the edge of the helicopter and crew’s capability. The NEST  helicopter 
crew’s expertise was instrumental in five people from the Enchanter  surviving . 
3.106  The Enchanter  SAR operation is considered by those involved  as at the upper end of 
challenge and complexity , and yet it only involved one 16-metre vessel with 10 peo ple 
on board , very close to the New Zealand  coast . At any time in New Zealand , there are 
likely to be much larger vessels with more people on board operating in even more 
remote areas than North Cape.  The Commission has considered the accident on that 
prem ise. 
3.107  It is also important to acknowledge that very little was known in the initial stages of the 
Enchanter  SAR operation. The operation started with a single activation of the 
 
56 When an asset is ‘tasked’ it is allocated a role in the SAR operation . 
 

<< Page 41 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 Enchanter ’s EPIRB , with no indication  whether it was real or an inadvertent EPIRB 
activation . Once  it had been established that  the emergency  was real , the response 
plan was formed  – but still with little information about the  situation. The broad plan 
evolve d and was refined as more informat ion was received.  In those initial stages there 
was no indication that it could  evolve into a n almost  two-day SAR operation involving 
multiple air and surface assets.  
SAR helicopters  
3.108  New Zealand ’s fleet of air ambulance/rescue helicopters is primarily used for air 
ambulance work  (95 per cent ). The other 5  per cent  is for SAR work.  The rescue 
helicopter fleet is divided into three sectors: Helicopters South Island, Helicopters 
Lower North Island and Helicopte rs Upper North Island . Each helicopter operator is 
contracted to the National A mbulance Sector Office (NASO) . NASO set up the Airdesk  
mainly  to coordinate the dispatch of rescue aircraft in support of NASO  (see Figure  23). 
3.109  The NASO  contracts outlined the availability and capability that helicopter operators 
must provide to NASO. Consequently, rescue helicopters are of the type and 
configuration that supports air ambulance work, rather than SAR work.  Also, air 
ambulance work is the m ain priority. If the RCC requests a rescue helicopter to be 
tasked to a SAR operation, it may or may not be available for SAR work depending on 
what air ambulance work  is in progress or planned . 
3.110  When the RCC contacted the Airdesk and requested a rescue hel icopter based out of 
Whangarei, the NEST helicopter was  not engaged on air ambulance work, so was 
immediately available . The ARHT helicopter that was requested and tasked to support 
the NEST helicopter  was returning from a n air ambulance task and  was then made 
available . The  second  AHRT helicopter that was later tasked had been engaged in air 
ambulance work  but was also available after sourcing an appropriate crew . 
3.111  There were delays in dispatching all three helicopters as each operator reconfigured 
the aircraft from air ambulance work to SAR work  and sourced the appropriate crew for 
winching over water.  
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 42 >>
     
Figure 23: Organisation chart showing the relationship between the air ambulance sector and 
the RCC. (The gr een arrows represent funding lines.)  
 
3.112  Rescue helicopters  are limited  in size because of  the maximum  weight restriction for 
most  hospital helipads. This affects their SAR people -carrying capability and flight 
range . For example, when  the NEST  helicopter ret rieved the first three survivors from 
the inverted flybridge, it s seating capacity  was exceeded , with one survivor having to 
be seated  unrestrained on the floor.  There was no room for retrieving the other two 
passengers from the inverted hull without making the return trip to the Te Hapu a 
forward command post.  
3.113  Another issue  is the funding of SAR specific  equipment for helicopters. The onboard 
medical equipment is mostly funded by NASO for air ambulanc e work. Any  additional 
SAR-related equipment is funded by the helicopter operator. With SAR work providing 
only 5  per cent  of operational time, it can be  difficult for the operator to recover the 
additional cost  of this equipment . 
3.114  Most rescue helicopter  crew use night -vision goggles for flying and searching at night. 
None of the aircraft tasked to the Enchanter  SAR operation were equipped with fixed 
gyro-stabilised  or portable thermal -imaging equipment , which is particularly useful 
when searching for living people in large spans  of water. Fixed gyro -stabili sed thermal -
imaging equipment creates  a significant weight penalty on helicopters that are often 
already up to all -up maximum weight with the medical  equipment, medical personnel  
and patients  on board . 
3.115  The RNZAF operate s a fleet of eight NH90 helicopters that are larger  and have a longer 
range than most standard NASO -contracted rescue helicopters. Although winch 
capable, they were not rated for ‘wet wi nching’57 at the time of this accident. The 
RNZAF helicopter crews are trained in and routinely practi se search and rescue. They 
are tasked by RCC from time to time but not as often as they once were . There used to 
 
57 Retrieval of people from water  

 

<< Page 43 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 be an NH90 permanently located in South Island that was used almost exclusively for 
SAR operations . Anecdotally a policy  has evolved,  or a directive made , that they should 
not be tasked when a commercial helicopter is available  and can be used . It is not clear 
by whom  and when this policy was put in place.  
3.116  Currently all eight NH90s are located at the RNZAF Ohakea Air Force Base in North 
Island. The RNZAF has a performance agreement to have one NH90 helicopter always 
available for SAR work at two hours’ notice . There  is an opportunity  to exp lore 
potential  synerg ies between RNZAF and SAR to make better use of the NH90 fleet (or 
any other fleet  operated by Defence  Joint Forces ) to enhance New Zealand ’s SAR 
capability.  
SAR helicopter crews  
3.117  With  the current SAR framework , air crews  for NAS O-contracted  operators comprise  
pilots, co -pilots, doctors  and critical care paramedics . It can at times  be unclear 
whether a task is related to air ambulance or SAR work , or both . For example , when a 
rescue helicopter is tasked to search for and r ecover a person known to be injured , 
there can be an element of search and , because it is known that a per son requires 
medical attention , there is the requirement for an air ambulance, which the helicopter 
fulfils as well. Therefore, there  can be  an obvious crossover of roles within  the 
helicopter  crew.  
3.118  The crew roles that are specific to SAR work are rescue swimmers and winch operators 
although , in the scenario described  above, the winch operator can be required for both 
air ambulance and SAR work.  One issue that arises is the cost of training and retaining 
crew specifically for SAR work , particularly  when it represents only five per cent  of 
revenue -earning helicopter operations. A second issue is the standardisation of 
training for these roles . 
3.119  To resolv e this issue some critical care paramedics  also train as rescue swimmer s 
and/or winch operator s. This creates another potential issue – critical care paramedics 
are often employed by air ambulance operators for NASO , thus creating a potential 
tension in assigning tasks and responsibility.  
3.120  All three  rescue helicopters tasked to the Enchanter  SAR operation encountered  issues 
assembling  a complete crew with sufficient experience for the high -risk task . There 
were consequential  delays . The reasons varied from there being a general shortage of 
experienced winch operators and rescue swimmers, to several being giv en annual leave 
at the same time by their primary employer s, who are primarily concerned with 
ambulance services .58 If the first rescue helicopter tasked  had been  responding to air 
ambulance work, it would likely have been airborne within about 20 minutes . By the 
time the helicopter had been transitioned from air ambulance to SAR mode and the 
appropriate crew assembled, it departed  85 minutes after having been tasked. This is 
not a criticism  of the crew . They were rightfully assessing the risks of the oper ation and 
doing the best allowed by the system in which they were operating.  
3.121  Training of crew for rescue helicopters is conducted and funded  by the helicopter  
operator  to meet the standards set out in the NASO Aeromedical and Air Rescue 
Standard. The Stand ard provides detailed  requirements for  medical operations , but not 
for winch operators and rescue swimmers . They are simply required to have

 ‘completed a course of training that meets current accepted practice and be certified 
by an approved person , with c ompetency checks completed at 12 -month intervals and 
recorded ’. An approved person is an operator’s check and training pilot or winch 
operator , as designated within the company’s operating exposition  approved by the 
Civil Aviation Authority . 
3.122  There is no definition of ‘current accepted practice’. There is no mandated or 
recommended training syllabus. This means the training standards may vary 
significantly between operators  across the country . This has  proven  to be  problematic 
when crew move between operators . 
3.123  The issue arises because  of a regulatory gap. Medical staff are governed  by ambulance 
and NASO standards. Flight crew (pilots) are governed  by civil aviation rules. Rescue 
swimmers and winch opera tors are not governed  by any specific standards. The NZSAR 
Council and the NZSAR Secretariat only provide strategic oversight and governance for 
the SAR sector . They do not currently have the mandate to set standards for the sector.   
3.124  In contrast , the Austr alian SAR framework operates to a strict set of standards that 
ensure s there is consistency and safety across the entire sector . 
Fuel supply  
 
Safety Issue: The national availability of fuel for helicopters likely to be engaged in extended 
SAR operations in remote areas is not well documented or understood by the SAR coordinating 
authorities.  
3.125  NEST had purchased a 1200 litre fuel trailer to be kep t at Kaitaia Hospital. Fuel suppl y 
for helicopters  in the Far North  was limited and its scarcity was affecting their air 
ambulance operation, which was essentially based around Kaitaia Hospital.  This fuel 
trailer was the furthest north permanent supply of Jet A1 fuel available to  aircraft.  
3.126  Helicopter pilots are responsib le for ensuring their aircraft have sufficient fuel to safely 
conduct their task s. Helicopter operators are responsib le for ensuring their total fleet 
has a sufficient supply of fuel to support their operations. This is not difficult for 
routine tasking. However, SAR operations are anything but routine. The Enchanter  SAR 
operation began as a one -helicopter  and then two -helicopter operation with an 
unknown e nd point. It grew into a multiple -aircraft multi -day operation.  
3.127  While individual pilots and helicopter operators can manage their fuel on a task -by-
task basis, they do not have the oversight that the RCC has as the SAR plan evolve s. 
There is therefore some  responsibility on the RCC’s part to prompt pilots/operators 
about  fuel supply before it becomes an issue for the aircraft it is tasking and renders 
them inoperative with consequential delays to the SAR plan.  
3.128  The RCC began inquiring about  sourcing fuel shortly after midnight  on the day of the 
accident . Fuel was eventually sourced  once the RCC learned that the NEST helicopter 
was grounded at Kaitaia Hospital , but it took several hours before fuel reach ed the two 
helicopters at Kaitaia Hospital and the Te Hapua forward command post . During the 
46-hour SAR operation  the RCC made  29 phone calls trying to source  fuel, adding to 
the already full workload of the coordinating staff.  
3.129  The lack of available fuel in the region resulted in a four-and-a-half-hour  period in 
which helicopters were unable to search for the remaining five people  in the water.  
 

<< Page 45 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 3.130  Caching fuel for extended air operations in remote areas is not straight forward. Fuel 
has a shelf life and can det eriorate over time. The quantity and quality of fuel require 
careful management. However, there will be opportunities to synergise the 
requirement of caching fuel in remote areas with routine aircraft operations. The 
Commission has recommended  that the Secretary for Transport  work with SAR 
coordinators and providers of SAR air assets across New Zealand  to identify 
opportunities for caching  fuel for extended SAR operations in remote areas , and to 
establish  and maintain a database of identified stored fuel  and fuel supply logistics.  
Fixed -wing aircraft  
3.131  Fixed -wing aircraft are important for SAR operations. While they do not have the 
rescue capability of helicopters, they provide an important cost-effective search 
function . The Enchanter  SAR operation  has hig hlighted issues  with the availability of 
suitable fixed-wing aircraft for SAR operations . 
3.132  The P -3K2 provide d an ideal  communications platform , making it suitable as an on -
scene coordination asset . The P -3K2 crew were able to relay information to the RCC, 
and direct other assets to search various debris fields. The aircraft also ha d a thermal 
imaging s uite capable of  detecting  large objects in the water such as vesse ls. However , 
the suite was not ideally suit ed for detecting  small objects in the water such as people.  
The P -3K2 was ideally suited for long -range SAR operations, which is important 
considering New Zealand ’s vast SAR area . 
3.133  On the night of the response, rain squalls were moving through the area . The 
associated cloud hindered the view from the P -3K2, requiring them to fly at low 
altitude beneath the cloud.  Operating a large aircraft at low al titude at night meant it 
had to stay  further offshore  than the actual scene , to maintain a safe clearance from  
terrain . 
3.134  The Coast guard operate s two Cessna aircraft , one based at Ardmore in Auckland,  and 
one based at Kerikeri in the Far North . The RCC tasked these aircraft during daylight 
hours . The aircraft  offered a cost -effective59 search solution  for the Enchanter  SAR 
operation . They were  able to fly close to shore  in areas that the P -3K2 could not . 
However, they have  limitations . The re are only two and they are both based to cover 
the Auckland  and Far North areas  only, thus limiting their use for other regions. The 
aircraft are rest ricted to daylight operations , and subject to visual flight rules .60 Their 
SAR capability is limited to visual observation and radio direction -finding equipment.  
3.135  New Zealand  has a long coastline to cover for SAR operations . There is an opportunity 
to introduc e a medium -sized aircraft suitably equipped for SAR operations at a lower 
operational cost than the larger aircraft available . Such an aircraft would be better 
suited to SAR operatio ns such as with the Enchanter  and could also prove more 
efficient for medium -range SAR operations to South Pacific islands . There is also an 
opportunity to use these aircraft for other NZDF  operations, and those of other 
Government departments, such as Fis heries New Zealand  and New Zealand  Customs.  
 
59 They are both totally funded through Coastguard New Zealand  
60 Civil Aviation Authority criteria essentially limit their use to good weather when the pilot can navigate visually 
without the aid of instruments.

 3.136  The Commission raised this possibility in its Preliminary Report to the Royal 
Commission of Inquiry  into the sinking of the interisland passenger and freight ferry 
MV Princess Ashika  on 5 August 2009 .61 The recommendation  was: 
[New Zealand] t o explore the possibility of dedicated search and rescue aircraft fitted with 
SAR equipment and trained crew being made available to conduct search and rescue 
operations in the New Zealand  and Fiji SAR areas. Such an airc raft could be multi -purpose 
to conduct other maritime and land -based activities such as customs and Fisheries.  
3.137   Australia uses such an  aircraft for its SAR operations , which has proven successful.  The 
Commission has made a recommendation  for the Ministry of Transport to explore this 
opportunity.  
Surface vessels  
3.138  There is an issue with New Zealand  having sufficient readily available  and suitable 
surface vessels for participating in challenging and extended SAR operations, not 
dissimilar to the issue with aviation assets  described above.  
3.139  The NZ Police has two maritime units, one based in Auckland and one in Wellington. 
These assets are primarily for addressing crime and support ing the NZ Police Dive 
Squad. They are suitable for SAR operations , but their ava ilability is limited to the areas 
where they happen to be  located , primarily the Greater Auckland and Wellington areas . 
The Auckland NZ Police launch did not participate in the Enchanter  SAR operation . 
3.140  The RNZN also has several assets suitable for SAR operations , but again their 
availability will be determined by their current location . The RNZN’s service agreement 
requires it to have one vessel available for deployment out of  Auckland at 12 hours’ 
notice . 
3.141  The HMNZS Taupo  was coincidentally operating in  the Hauraki Gulf , Auckland  at the 
time of the Enchanter  accident. The commander responded to the mayday relays and 
proceeded to the area , sailing  into heavy weather  and arriving on scene at 1110  the 
following day.  
3.142  When the HMNZS Taupo  did arrive, the RCC handed over the on -scene coordinator 
role to the commander . However, the RNZN  was not familiar with the term and 
assumed the naval war fare role of on -scene commander, which effectively took control 
away from the RCC. The issue was even tually realised  and addressed but not before the 
coordination of the search patterns had been disrupted  for a number of hours . 
3.143  The issue is likely due in part  to the lack of joint SAR training between the RNZN and 
the RCC. RNZN personnel are trained in bas ic SAR techniques, but not in rescue 
coordination. Ideally, it should be standard practice for organisations routinely used as 
on-scene coordinators to be trained in and  familiar with RCC procedures , and that 
practice be documented in the overarching SAR system. The Commission has made a 
recommendation  for the Ministry of Transport to address this issue.  
3.144  Coastg uard has multiple assets spread strategically across all New Zealand  regions. The 
organisation is a charity relying  entirely on volunteers  and raises approximately 
70 per cent of its  operating  income from donations , membership,  and grants . (The 
remaining 30  per cent  of costs is met by a government  service level agreement .) While 
the organisation is consid ered to be the primary SAR service in  New Zealand , most  of

Commission of Inquiry into the sinking of the MV Princess Ashika.  
 

<< Page 47 >>
 Final Report MO -2022 -201 its work involves responding to recreational boat events, providing fuel for boaters 
who have run out or towing to safety those that have broken down . 
3.145  The funding model does not support the build and operation of larger craft capable of 
operating offshore . Consequently, t heir craft are primarily designed for inshore  event s 
and less so for serious complex extended SAR operations, as is the training provided to 
their volunteer crew.  That is  not a criticism  of their performance. They are renowned for 
providing a  good and  efficient service. The rescues they perform will often prevent an 
event escalating to one requiring a SAR response.  
3.146  There are two other limiting factor s: not all  Coastguard b oats are surveyed to operate 
outside of inshore or restricted coastal limits; and the qualification that Coastguard can 
issue to their volunteer skippers  restricts them  to operat ing within 1 2 miles of the 
coast .62 
3.147  Houhora is home to the northernmost  Coastguard unit in the country.  Coastguard  
Houhora  relies on volunteers to  maintain and operate a 9.5-metre rigid-hull inflatable 
boat (RHIB)63 to provide  services from Cape Re inga to Doubtless Bay  (see Figure  24). 
3.148  Coast guard Houhora had received the initial notification of the distress at 2035 , while  
Houhora was still experiencing heavy winds associated with the passing  storm system .  
3.149  As with any notification , the Coastguard Houhora unit conducted a risk assessment to 
ensure their own safety. After consulting with local operators, and with the duty officer 
and SAR coordinator at Coastguard New Zealand operations  centre, it was determined 
that the risk of responding would be too high. The decision not to deploy was 
appropriate  in the circumstances . 
3.150  With Coastguard Houhora unable to respond that night, HMNZS Taupo  being some 
distance  away, and there being no commercial vessels in the immediate area, there 
were no surface vessels available to  participate in the Enchanter  SAR operation until 
about eight hours after the accident . 
 
 
 
62 Coast guard vessels may be granted permis sion by Maritime New Zealand  to go beyond restricted limits for the 
purposes of SAR if required.  
63 This has since the accident been replaced with a 10-metre  RHIB 
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201

Figure 24: Coastguard Houhora vessel  
 
Commercial Vessels  
3.151  The use of commercial  vessels  of opportunity  during SAR operations is common  
practice throughout the world as they are often  likely to be nearest to the scene.  
International law under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
(UNCLOS ) Article 98 also requires masters of vessels to respond to distress  unless it 
endangers the vessel and /or its crew.  
3.152  During a SAR operation the RCC will use any available asset that is able  to assist . The 
lack of professionally crewed marine assets  suitable for offshore SAR operations  means 
SAR coordinators  have  fewer opt ions for surface assets, which increas es their 
dependency on untrained civilian  vessels  of opportunity . Using commercial vessels in a 
weather -related  event like the  capsize of  the Enchanter , often means that other vessels 
may not be in the immediate area.  
3.153  During the Enchanter  SAR operation,  the RCC had tasked five commercial vessels to aid 
in the search. Of the five vessels , one was another charter fishing boat owned by 
Enchanter  Fishing Charters, while the other four were commercial fishing  boats.  
3.154  The crews of these vessels (some of whom had children on board ), had the challenge 
of searching for long periods of time and sighting and recovering deceased victims 
from the sea.   
3.155  Professional SAR personnel have resources and support available to help them to deal 
with the mental toll this type of work can take. Civilians do not necessarily have access 
to that same support . It should be noted that at  the conclusion of the Enchanter  
search , individuals w ho were involved were made aware of available mental health 
services .

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 4 Findings  
Ngā kiteng a 
 
4.1 There were no known mechanical or equipment failures that contributed to the 
accident.  
4.2 It is about as likely as not  that the accident occurred around the  10 met re depth 
contour off Murimotu  Island, North Cape.  
4.3 It was not the skipper’s intention to navigate close to the shore in shallow er water. The 
reason for the Enchanter being there was not established . 
4.4 It was reasonable for a vessel of the Enchanter ’s size, desig n, stability  and construction 
to be operating in the weather and sea conditions around North Cape at the time of 
the accident, provided it was operated in accordance with its Maritime Transport Safety 
System and Marine Transport Operator Plan.  
4.5 The Enchanter  was knocked down by a wave that was larger and with a steeper profile 
than the average wave conditions it had been encountering, because of  one or a 
combination of the following factors:  
• waves up to twice that of the significant wave height can n aturally occur in deep 
water  
• the convergence of two different wave patterns can cause random large waves  
• reflection of waves off the shoreline  
• the tendency for waves to increase in height and steepen when they enter 
shallow er water . 
4.6 The Enchanter exceeded all stability parameters required under Maritime Rule Part 40, 
and all its maritime documents were current at the time of the accident.  
4.7 The Enchanter was unable to recover from the knock  down because it was very likely  
tipped past its point of vanishing stability and its superstructure failed allowing down -
flooding of its internal spaces.  
4.8 It is virtually certain  that the connection between the Enchanter ’s superstructure and 
hull was in good condition – the connection failing in overload when hydrodynamic 
forces sustained during the knock  down exceeded its design parameters.  
4.9 Nine of the ten people onboard are known to have  survived the initial capsize, but four 
of them later died. It is virtually certain  that o ne or a combination of the following 
factors had an effect on survivability : 
• time immersed in the water with associated hypothermia and swim failure  
• limited flotation support (except for one person who was retrieved from a 
lifebuoy ) 
• injuries sustained during the capsize  
• pre-existing medical conditions . 
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 50 >>
 4.10 None of the people on board were able to put on a life jacket  because of  the 
suddenness of the capsize and because all life jacket s were stowed below in the 
forward cabin , which  was difficult to access.  
4.11 Opportunities to increase  surviva bility  were missed for the following reasons:  
• the life raft s likely did not automatically de ploy 
• only two of the four lifebuoy s were fitted with automatic lights  
• two of the lifebuoy s were not marked with retro -reflective tape and the 
reflective tape on the other two was degraded and of limited effectiveness.  
4.12 The crew of the first helicopter on sc ene managed the high -risk task of wet winching in 
the dark over water with skill. Their expertise was instrumental in saving the lives of five 
people from the Enchanter . 
4.13 There were delays in the deployment of rescue helicopters to the Enchanter scene 
while appropriately qualified and experienced crew were  assembled.  
4.14 Although helicopters were made available for the Enchanter SAR operation, the current 
New Zealand  SAR system  does not ensure that readily  available, appropriately 
equipped and crewed, air resources will be available for future SAR operations, 
particularly in remote areas.  
4.15 There was a period of 4 hours  and 36 minutes when the lack of available fuel 
prevented heli copters searching for the remaining five people  in the water, which was 
attributable in part to fuel supply being based on air ambulance services and not  on 
extended SAR operations in remote areas.  
4.16 The current New Zealand  SAR system does not guarantee that  dedicated, appropriately 
equipped and fixed -wing aircraft resources will be available for future SAR operations.  
4.17 The current New Zealand  SAR system does not adequately provide for  dedicated, 
appropriately equipped surface vessels to be available for future SAR operations.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission’s analysis. They may not always relate 
to factors direct ly contributing to the acciden t or incident. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future  transport safety.  
5.2 Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant . Otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to addr ess the issue.   
Safety issue s 
Safety issue – Maritime New Zealand ’s system for auditing and assessing the performance of 
accredited vessel surveyors is not ensuring they are interpreting and applying maritime rules 
correctly when surveying vessels.  
5.3 The consequence of this safety issue  is the risk of vessels either intentionally or 
inadvertently operating outside maritime rule requirements.  
5.4 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Sectio n 6 to address this issue.  
Safety Issue – New Zealand m aritime rules do not adequately address the need for proper 
stowage of life jackets on board pa ssenger vessels so that passengers have access to a life 
jacket  in the event of a sudden catastrophic event.  
5.5 The consequence of this safety issue is that passengers and crew will not be able to 
access a life jacket  following a sudden and catastrophic event.  
5.6 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Section 6 to address  this issue.  
Safety issue – There is no requirement for commercial vessels that carry passengers to be fitted 
with any form o f tracking device such as AIS or other commercially available tracking systems.  
5.7 The consequence of this safety issue is potential delay in the start of SAR operations 
and compromise in the ir efficiency.  
5.8 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Section 6 to address th is issue.  
Safety Issue – New Zealand does not have readily available and suitable resources that can be 
assigned to SAR operations in the following operational areas:  
• helicopters that are fully equipped and crewed for extended SAR operations across 
New Zealand and its coastal waters  
• medium -range fixed -wing aircraft designed, equipped and crewed for SAR operations 
across Ne w  Zealand coastal waters and the EEZ  
• vessels that are designed, equipped and manned by crew practi sed at conducting SAR 
operations out to offshore limits.  
5.9 The potential consequence of this safety issue is the failure of the SAR system to 
respond to a major accident adequately and efficiently  in remote areas  with the 
potential for avoidable  loss of life.  
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 52 >>
 5.10 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Section 6 to address this issue.  
Safety Issue – There is currently no dedicated programme that requires organisations that 
operate SAR assets and might routinely be assigned on -scene coordinator status to engage in 
joint training with the RCC to ensure consistency in knowledge of the SAR framewo rk and 
terminology.  
5.11 The potential consequence of this safety issue is a potential breakdown in the 
framework and structure of a SAR operatio n. 
5.12 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Sec tion 6 to address this issue.  
Safety Issue – The national availability of fuel for helicopters likely to be engaged in extended 
SAR operations in remote areas is not well documented and understood by SAR coordinating 
authorities.  
5.13 The consequence of this safety issue is that SAR operations could be de layed or 
prevented because tasked assets have insufficient fuel supplies to perform their task . 
5.14 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation  in Section 6 to address this issue.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 6 Recommendations  
Ngā tūtohutanga  
General   
6.1 The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and incidents  
6.2 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendation s are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future.    
New recommendations   
 
To the Ministry of Transport  
6.3 On 13 July 2023,  the Commission recommended that  the Secretary for Transport : 
Delegate responsibility to one or more  entities, for the remit, jurisdiction and resources 
to set standards for search and rescue  (SAR)  assets and the training of their SAR  crews 
and enter into service level agreements with other agencies and operators for the 
provision of search and rescue assets.  [012/23] 
Coordinate across  government and other appropriate agencies to identify and source  
air and maritime assets that are appropriately designed, equipped and crewed to meet 
New Zealand ’s full SAR requirements . Government agencies that have a potential dual 
use for these assets or who have existing assets that could provide a dual role should 
be considered  [013/23]  
Work with  SAR coordinators  and providers of SAR air assets across New Zealand  to 
identify opportunities for the supply  and, if necessary , the storage of fuel for extended 
SAR operations in remote areas , and maintain a database of identified stored fuel and 
fuel supply logistics.  [014/23] 
Work with  SAR coordination  entities  to ensure they have procedures for prompting the 
operator of air assets about  the maximum range of operation and opportunities for 
refueling for sustained SAR operations.  [015/23] 
Work with SAR coordination authorities to identify SAR assets  that are likely to be 
routinely called on to act as on -scene coordinators and develop a joint training 
program me that will ensure that they work to the same framework and use the same 
terminology as the coordinating authorities.  [016/23] 
 
To Maritime New  Zealand  
6.4 On 13 July 2023,  the Commission recommended that  the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand : 
implement s a formal system that: 
• notifies surveyors of current and emerging chan ges to maritime rules for the 
construction , maintenance  and surveying of vessels  
 
Final Report MO -2022 -201 
<< Page 54 >>
 • clarifies, where needed , the intent  and application  of maritime rules  and other 
relevant standard s [017/23] 
Ensure s that Maritime New Zealand  has an adequate system for monitoring the 
performa nce of marine  survey ors. [018/23] 
Ensure s that appropriate rules and/or guidance is available to  marine surveyors and 
vessel operators about the risk of having all life jacket s stowed in one place that might 
not be accessible during  foreseeable events . [019/23] 
Introduce s the requirement for commercial vessels to be fitted with automatic 
identification system ( AIS) or equivalent  when carrying passengers  outside inshore 
limits . [020/23]. 
Notice of recommendations   
6.5 The Commission has given notice to the New Zealand Search and Rescue Council  
Secretariat that it has issued recommendation s [017/23 , 018/23, 019/23 and 020/23 ] to 
the Ministry of Transport  and that th is recommendation will require the involvement of 
the New Zealand Search and Rescue Council .

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 7 Key lessons  
Ngā akoranga matua  
 
7.1 For any forecast  or actual  sea conditions, mariners should expect to encounter waves 
up to twice the average size at any time . 
7.2 Mariners should , if possible , avoid navigating in shallow water  in adverse wave 
conditions  or, if shallow water cannot be avoided, be particularly vigilant and expect 
waves much larger and steeper than those that would  be expected in deep water . 
7.3 It is important that passengers either get to practi se putting on a life jacket  or are 
given a demonstration o f how to do so during a safety briefing , rather than having to 
work this out under the pressure of an emergency . 
7.4 It would be safer  if life jacket s were distributed in several places throughout  a vessel 
where they will be more accessible in a sudden emergency . 
7.5 Wearing a n inflatable life jacket  or similar buoyancy aid will enhance the safety of 
people when fishing from open decks  in open and exposed waters.  
7.6 There is so me safety benefit in wearing a personal locator beacon as a backup  to the 
EPIRB s required on commercial vessels , in case  the circumstances of an accident 
prevent the use of the EPIRB . 
7.7 Fitting an AIS or equivalent tracking device to a vessel will significantly improve the 
likelihood of being found and reduce the time for being rescued, particularly if the 
primary life-saving equipment fails or cannot be activated.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 9 Conduct of the Inquiry  
He tikanga rapunga  
 
9.1 On 21 March  2022 , Maritime New Zealand  notified the Commission of the occurrence. 
The Commission subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an investigator -in-charge.  
9.2 On 21  March  2022  the Commission is sued an Order to Produce and Protect the 
Enchanter , including any debris,  objects or items originating from the vessel.  
9.3 The Commission deployed a  team of four investigators  to Northland on 
21 March  2022 , who  spent four days conducting interviews and gather ing evidence.  
9.4 On 31  March  2022 , two investigators were redeployed to Northland to oversee the 
salvage and tow ing of the Enchanter  wreck to Ho uhora, Northland . A GPS was 
recovered from  the wreck during the salvage and retained by the Commission for 
analysis. The investigators conducted a thorough inspection of the Enchanter  wreck  on 
the shores of Houhora Harbour, after which permission was given for the wreck to be 
dismantled and transported to a location in Houhora.  
9.5 On 25 May 202 2, the Commission  authorised release of the dismantled wreckage of 
the Enchanter  to the vessel’s insurers for disposal by marked (GPS) burial in a 
registered landfill , and release of the two recovered diesel engines for on selling . The 
Commission’s Order to Produce and Protect remained in place  for debris, objects or 
items originating from the vessel.  
9.6 From  01 to 02 June 2022, three  investigators travelled to Northland and Auckland to 
conduct interviews with several companies and agencies involved in the SAR operation 
for the Enchanter . 
9.7 On 07  June 2022,  two investigators conducted interviews with staff from the Rescue 
Coordination Ce ntre at Wellington.  
9.8 On 14  June 2022, two investigators conducted an interview  with representat ives from 
the EPIRB manufacturer.   
9.9 From  05 to 07 July 2022 , two investigators attended a search and rescue seminar at 
Wellington to gather further information abo ut the responsibilities and interaction 
between providers of SAR assets . During this period investigators conducted an 
interview with staff from the Ministry of Health ’s Nationa l Ambulance Sector Office  in 
relation to the provision of helicopter services f or SAR operations . 
9.10 On 26 October  2022  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to  ten 
Interested Parties  for their comment.  
9.11 Submissions were received from eight  Interested Persons , with the Ministry of 
Transport delegating their response to the NZS AR Council . One of the submissions 
included a report from  an independent expert . Any changes as a result of these 
submissions have been included in the final report.  
9.12 On 13 January  2023, investigators  engaged an expert in EPIRB data and f unctionality to 
provide an analysis of the data. The expert is an employee of the EPIRB manufacturer . 
However, their analysis is based on past experience  as an operator with the United 
Kingdom Mission Control Centre and does not reflect the opinion of the manufacturer.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 Appendix 1  Wave formation and characteristics  
The survivors described the Enchanter  being knocked down by a large steep wave. The 
following information provide s context to Section 3  of this report.  
Wave  formation  
The size and behaviour of waves are determined by a range of factors, from the 
direction of the swell to the speed of the tide, prevailing ocean currents, the depth of 
the water, the shape of the seafloor, the presence of reefs and sandbanks, and even 
the temperature of the ocean .64. 
However, wind is the primary  factor that governs  the size of the waves. Waves are 
caused by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean and transferring energy from 
the atmosphere to the water. The height of waves is determined by the speed of the 
wind, how long it blows, and crucially the ‘fetch’  (the d istance that the wind blows in a 
single direction over the water ). 
Bigger waves result from conditions that cause strong winds to blow for a sustained 
period over a large expanse of ocean. The resulting waves can travel for hundreds or 
even thousands of ki lometres , smaller waves being absorbed by larger ones , faster 
waves overtaking slower  ones, all gradually growing and arranging themselves into the 
regular ‘sets’  or wave trains65. 
The result of these interactions is that it is normal to experience a wide range of wave 
heights when on the water.  
‘Significant wave height’ is the international convention66 used to describe  the size of 
swell and wind waves (or ‘sea waves’) in coastal forecasts. Significant wave height is 
defined as the average wave height, fro m trough to crest, of the highest one -third of 
the measured or observed waves.  
Figure  25 shows that a mariner will experience a typical ‘wave spectrum’ containing a 
low number of small waves (at the bottom) and a low number of very large waves (at 
the top) . The greatest number of waves is indicated by the widest area of the spectrum 
curve. The highest one -third of waves is highlighted in dark blue, and the average 
height of waves in this group is the  significant wave height .

Figure 25: Significant wave height  
(Source : Australian Bureau of Meteorology)  
While the most common waves are lower than the significant wave height, it is 
statistically possible to encounter a wave that is much higher  – especially if you are out 
in the water for a long time. It is estimated that approximately one in every 3 ,000 
waves will reach twice the height of the significant wave height  – roughly equivalent to 
three times every 24 hours.  
Wave energy and wave changes with depth  
As the energy of a wave passes through water, the energy sets water particles into 
orbital motion , as shown in Figure  26. Water particles near the surface move in circular 
orbits with diameters approximately equal to the wave height. The orbital diameter, 
and the  wave energy, decreases deeper in the water. Below a depth of half the 
wavelength, water is unaffected by the wave energy.  
Swells are  deep -water waves , meaning that the depth of the water is greater than half 
the wave’s wavelength. The energy of a deep -water wave does not touch the bottom in 
the open water (see Figure  27). 
When deep -water waves move into shallow water, they change into breaking waves. 
When the energy of the waves touches the ocean floor, the water particles drag along 
the bottom and flatten their orbit.

Because of the friction of the deeper part of the wave with particles on the bottom, the top 
of the wave begins to move faster than the deeper parts of the wave. When this happens, 
the front surface of the wave gradually becomes steeper than the back surface . 
Waves travel ling in water where depth is less than half the wavelength but greater than one -
twentieth the wavelength are referred to as  transitional waves , which  are often wind -
generated waves that have move d into shallower water.

 Rogue Waves – comment from the United Sta tes National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration  
Rogue, freak or killer waves have been part of maritime  folklore for centuries but  have only 
been accepted as real by scientists over the past few decades.  
Rogues, called 'extreme storm waves' by scientists, are those waves that are greater than 
twice the size of surrounding waves, are very unpredictable, and often come unexpectedly 
from directions other than prevailing wind and waves.  
Most reports of extreme storm waves say they look like "walls of water." They are often 
steep -sided with unu sually deep troughs.  
Since these waves are uncommon, measurements and analysis of this phenomenon is 
extremely rare. Exactly how and when rogue waves form is still under investigation, but there 
are several known causes:  
Constructive interference  – extreme waves often form because swells, while travel ling 
across the ocean, do so at different speeds and directions. As these swells pass through one 
another, their crests, troughs and lengths sometimes coincide and reinforce each other. This 
process can f orm unusually large, towering waves that quickly disappear. If the swells are 
travelling in the same direction, these mountainous waves may last for several minutes 
before subsiding.  
Focusing of wave energy  – when waves formed by a storm develop in a water  current 
against the normal wave direction, an interaction can take place that results in a shortening 
of the wave frequency. This can cause the waves to dynamically join together, forming very 
big 'rogue' waves. The currents where these are sometimes seen  are the  Gulf Stream  and 
Agulhas Current . Extreme waves developed in this fashion tend to be longer lived.

 Final Report MO -2022 -201 Appendix 2  The Enchanter ’s stability information  
2.1 Part of a stability analysis is to calculate what is called a GZ Curve. GZ is the theoretical 
righting lever that forces a vessel back upright when it is heeled by any force s such as 
wind and waves. The longer the GZ lever, the more force is imparted to return the 
vessel upright. If a vessel has a negative GZ righting lever, then the force is acting to 
capsize the ves sel rather than returning it upright . In Figure  28, when the vessel is 
upright  (left) the upward thrust of buoyancy ( B) is equal to and vertically aligned with 
the downward weight acting through the vessel’s centre of gravity  (G). The vessel is 
floating in equilibrium when force of G equals B. 
2.2 When the vessel heels due to wind and/or waves  (right) , the position of the vessel’s 
centre of gravity  (G) remains the same  but the position of the centre of buoyanc y 
moves across to the ne w centroid of the underwater volume  (B1). The upward thrust 
through B1 is no longer aligned with G. A righting lever (GZ) is thus created, which in 
this case tries to return the ship upright until G and B align again. The length of the 
righting lever GZ ch anges  as the vessel heels through a range of angles.  
 
Figure 28: Relationship between buoyancy, weight and centre of gravity  
2.3 For any given stability condition, a range of values for GZ can be calculated and plotted 
on a graph showing the length of GZ on the X axis against the angle of heel on the  Y 
axis. This graph is the GZ curve mentioned above. Figure  29 shows the calculated GZ 
curve for a typical stability condition that the Enchanter  had when nearing the end of a 
voyage. The value of GZ starts off at zero when there is zero angle of heel and then 
steadily increases as the angle of heel increases . The length of the righting lever GZ 
peaks at a heel angle of 33.8 degrees  and then begins to decrease as the a ngle of heel 
increa ses beyond 33.8 degrees.  
2.4 The value for GZ reaches zero at a heel angle of 77 degrees. This is known as the angle 
of vanishing stability . If the Enchanter  heeled past 77 degrees,  the value of GZ becomes 
negative. At that point GZ becomes a capsizing lever  and the vessel will capsize.

 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngāti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedi es and how to avoid them. A ‘waka whai mārama’ (i te ara 
haumaru) is ‘a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding’. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from ‘te ao mārama’ – the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) an d Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. ‘Te ara’ is ‘the path’ and ‘haumaru’ is ‘safe’ or ‘risk free’.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne  Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represents the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā hau e whā - the four winds  
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, ‘Ngā hau e whā ’ (the four winds), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represent s the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa’s ‘long 
white cloud’. The letter ‘A’ is present, standing for a ‘Aviation’.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind ) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different ‘ara wai’ (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The ‘V’ shape is a ship’s prow and its wake. The letter ‘M’  is present, standing for ‘Maritime.  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. ‘Rere’ is to flow or fly. ‘Whenua’ is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter ‘R’ is 
present, standing for ‘Rail’.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
