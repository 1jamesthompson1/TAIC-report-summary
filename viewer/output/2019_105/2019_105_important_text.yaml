  \ track conditions, \npreviously identified by the track evaluation car but not\
  \ repaired. Individually, the track \nexceedances would not have caused the derailment.\
  \  \n2.37 An exa mination of the derailed wagon found two inner wedge springs and\
  \ one outer \nspring shorter than the minimum length required for reuse.  \n2.38\
  \ The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) made \nrecommendations\
  \ to the Chief Executives of Ontrack and Toll Rail (predecessors of \nKiwiRail)\
  \ to critically review current track and the KiwiRail Mechanical Code standards\
  \ \nand maintenance tolerances to ensure they were compatible and minimised the\
  \ \npotential for derailments caused by dynamic interaction30 (009/05  and 010/05).\
  \ Codes \nand standards for the track and wagons have since been changed and the\
  \ status of the \nrecommendations changed to 'closed acceptable'.   \nInquiry RO\
  \ -2007 -115 \n2.39 On Wednesday 7 November 2007, express freight Train 533 derailed\
  \ on the Stratford -\n\u014Ckahukura line.  \n2.40 The Commission was unable to\
  \ determine conclusively the cause of the derailment. \nHowever, both the track\
  \ condition and the condition of the derailed wagon were at or \nnear the KiwiRail\
  \ Mechanical Code tolerance limits and were considered to be \ncontributory factors.\
  \  \n2.41 The Commission made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ\
  \ Transport \nAgency to address the issue of the current track and mechanical standards\
  \ and \nmaintenance tolerances not being compatible, and stated that there remai\
  \ ned a high \nrisk of derailments caused by dynamic interaction (029/09). In view\
  \ of the actions taken \nin 2.38, the status of this recommendation has been changed\
  \ to 'closed acceptable'.   \nInquiry RO -2019 -103 \n2.42 On Thursday 4 April 2019,\
  \ express freight Train 626  derailed within Palmerston North \nstation limits.\
  \  \n2.43 The Commission found that no single factor led to the derailment.  However,\
  \ it was very \nlikely that a combination of factors contributed to the derailment,\
  \ including:  \n\u2022 the track alignment and condition  \n\u2022 the train travelling\
  \ above the authorised line speed  \n\u2022 the condition of the wagon's suspension\
  \ system and its sensitivity to the track  \nconditio n  \n\u2022 the multiple cyclic\
  \ track twists before the POD. \n2.44 The Commission identified that KiwiRail  had\
  \ no procedure for identifying, evaluating \nand rectifying cyclic track twists\
  \ of a repetitive nature.  The Commission recommended \nthat KiwiRail address this\
  \ issue in order to reduce the likelihood of a wheel climb31 \nderailment.  (Recommendation\
  \ 003/20).  \n \n30 A situation when the track geo metry, wagon condition, wagon\
  \ loading and train speed are individually within \ntolerance limits, or marginally\
  \ in excess, but not to an extent that each variation on its own is sufficient to\
  \ be a \nprime cause of a derailment. However, when in combination the se conditions\
  \ can result in a derailment.  \n31 The action of a rail wheel being driven up the\

  \ Final Report RO -2019 -105 reference to the absolute minimum and/or desirable\
  \ minimum curve radius standards  \nfor track within yards or sidings.   \n3.10\
  \ The National Rail System Standard34, Section 6, Engineering Interoperability Standards\
  \ , \nrequired all rail vehicles to be capable of safely negotiating track  with\
  \ a curve radius of \n70 m . \n3.11 KiwiRail Track Code Supplement CSP 33 was replaced\
  \ by  the KiwiRail  Track Design \nStandard  T-ST-DE-5200 , effective from 30 June\
  \ 2019.  The standard for main lines and \nloops required a desirable minimum curve\
  \ radius of 150 m and an absolute minimum \ncurve radius of 90 m.  Wher e the coupling/uncoupling\
  \ of rolling stock was to be carried \nout in yards and sidings, the minimum curve\
  \ radius was to be 140 m.   \n3.12 The 71.4 m -radius curve leading up to  the POD\
  \ was therefore significantly tighter than \nthe absolute minimum prescribed in\
  \ the current standard.  When  combined with other \ntrack defects described in\
  \ the next section , and the absence of lubrication on the rail , it \nwas likely\
  \ that the tight -radius curve contributed to the derailment.   \n3.13 KiwiRail\
  \ has since introduced a revised track design standard and undertaken a \nnational\
  \ project to identify and programme remedial work to achieve a minimum curve \n\
  radius of 90 m  on all curves within freight yards and sidings . Had this not happened,\
  \ \nthe Commission would have likely made a recommendation.  \nSafety issue: The\
  \ track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in \n\
  accordance with company standards   \n3.14 The KiwiRail Track Geometry Standard\
  \ T -ST-AM-5120  required the Class 1** line fault \nto be inspected and verified\
  \ within three days, a 40 km/h temporary speed restriction \nto apply during the\
  \ inspection and repair s to be completed  within 14 days. If it were \nnot possible\
  \ to achieve the repair within the requ ired timescale, mitigations were \nrequired\
  \ to be in place until the repair were completed.   \n3.15 KiwiRail could not provide\
  \ evidence to confirm that the Class 1** line fault had been \ninspected and repaired\
  \ by 17 December 2018.  The fault had been recorded as clos ed \nout by the asset\
  \ engineer on 31 May 2019 without inspection or repair.  The post -\nderailment\
  \ track measure -up confirmed that the line fault remained (see Figure 7).  The\
  \ \nasset engineer  had stated , \"design geometry at turnouts, mitigation per 20\
  \ km/h\"  \n[maxi mum authorised line speed on the arrival/departure road] . On\
  \ its own, the line \nfault was not likely to have caused the derailment.   \n3.16\
  \ The Track Geometry Standard T -ST-AM-5120  specified that a 21 mm twist fault\
  \ was to \nbe inspected and verified within three months and  repaired within six\
  \ months.  \n3.17 KiwiRail could not provide evidence  that the 21 mm twist had\
  \ been repaired by the \ntarget date of 3 June 2019.  An analysis of the post -derailment\
  \ manual track geometry \nmeasure -up provided confirmation that the 21 mm twist\
  \ had not been attended to \n(see Figure 9). \n \n34 The National Rail System Standards\
  \ have been adopted by Kiw iRail and other operators using the controlled \nrail\
  \ network.  \n\n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -105 3.19 It was unlikely\
  \ that the individual twists would have been identified during the three -\nmonthly\
  \ scheduled visual inspection. The post -derailment track measure -up showed \n\
  that the value of each twist did not meet the threshold for immediate repair action.\
  \  \nHowever, cyclic track twists are known to contribute to derailments.   \nPost-derailment\
  \ condition of wagon UKK9599  \nSafety issue: The wagon was authorised to return\
  \ to service following a routine maintenance \ninspection with wheel flange surface\
  \ roughness outside specified  limits .  \n3.20 The KiwiRail Mechanical Code required\
  \ all wagons that derail ed, along with the wagon s \nimmediately ahead of and behind\
  \ them , to be examined and critical measurements  to \nbe taken .  \n3.21 Following\
  \ the derailment , the wagon deck was transported to KiwiRail's Hutt \nWorkshop\
  \ s by the Commission for further examination. The bogies were dismantled \non 7\
  \ August  2019, components were examined,  and critical measurements were taken.\
  \  \n3.22 The maintenance records confirmed that all four wheels on the leading\
  \ bogie had been \nre-profiled at the Westfield depot in Auckland on 19 June 2019\
  \ , as part of the two-\nyearly scheduled C -Check.   \n3.23 The KiwiRail Mechanical\
  \ Code specified  that the wheel tread and flange surface \nroughness finish was\
  \ to be no more than 12.5  micrometres  (\xB5m). The design of the \nStarret t SR10035\
  \ tool normally  used to measure surface roughness  was such that it was \nincapable\
  \ of measuring the surface roughness on the compound36, reverse curvature of \n\
  the wheel flange faces . However, when the machined surface finish on the wheel\
  \ \nflanges was compared to a standard 'scratch pad', the surface roughness was\
  \ \nestimated to be in the range of 25 -50 \xB5m, thereby exceeding the maximum\
  \ permitted \nby a factor of two to four (see Figure 11). \n  \n \n35 A tool that\
  \ separates into two pieces to measure surface roughness. A diamond stylus from\
  \ the lower part is \ndrawn across the part being measured. The vertical movement\
  \ of the stylus as it travels across peaks and valleys \nis detected by a pizo -electric\
  \ pic kup that converts the mechanical movement of the stylus into an electrical\
  \ \nsignal.  The electrical signal is digitised and sent to a microprocessor where\
  \ the parameters are calculated using \nstandardised algorithms and displayed on\
  \ the upper unit.   \n36 A com pound curve has non -constant radii.  \n \n  Final\
  \ Report RO -2019 -105 \n<< Page 15 >>\n  \nFigure 11: Tread and flange surface\
  \ roughness  \n3.24 The out -of-code flange surface roughness increased  the friction\
  \ on  the wheel/rail \ninterface . This factor , when combined with the track geometry\
  \ contributing factors \nmentioned in the earlier section , increased the likelihood\
  \ of  a wheel climb derailment.  \n3.25 In October 2019 KiwiRail updated its M6000\
  \ -500 Wheelset Manual - Wheel Lathes  \nstandard to include,  in part:  \n3.3 SURFACE\
  \ FINISH  \nThe surface finish of the tread profiles and tapered face of the flange\
  \ must not \nbe coarser than 12.5 micrometres Ra. A rough finish on the flange face\
  \ \nsubstantially increases the risk of derailment on curves.  \nFor underfloor\
  \ lathes, the surface finish on the tread part only, can be [up to] 25 \nmicrometres\
  \ .  \n3.26 See Figure 12 for surface -finish standards.  \n \nFigure 12: Surface\
  \ finish on flange and tread  \n3.27 Had KiwiRail not amended the roughness standard,\
  \ the Commission would have been \nlikely to make such  a recommendation.  \n\n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -105 Non-contribu ting factors  \n Loading\
  \  \n3.28 Wagon UKK9599 was conveying an evenly  loaded , 40-foot container with\
  \ a low-density \nproduct.  Following the derailment,  the container was recovered,\
  \  and check weighed at \n8.12 t before being placed on another wagon and transported\
  \ to Palmerston North.  No \nload imbalance was identified when the wagon passed\
  \ over a continuous -in-motion \nweigh station en route.  \n3.29 A 40-foot container\
  \ is relatively stiff when compared to a UKK -class wagon \nunderframe. Therefore,\
  \  a UKK -class wagon, when conveying a 40 -foot container, will \nreduce slightly\
  \ the wagon's ability to negotiate long -wheelbase track twists37.  \nTrain speed\
  \  \n3.30 Express freight trains entering the Wellington Freight Terminal were restricted\
  \ to a \nmaximum  speed  of 20 km/h (see Figure 13). However, there was no corresponding\
  \ \nboard to show the maximum speed for trains departing the Freight T erminal.\
  \ The \ndriver thought that departing trains were restricted to a maximum speed\
  \ of 20 km/h.  \nKiwiRail's  Joint Yard Operating Plan did not identify the maximum\
  \ operating speed for \ntrains departing the Wellington Freight Terminal.  However,\
  \ KiwiRail has confirmed that \nthe maximum authorised speed at the time of the\
  \ derailment was 25 km/h.   \n \nFigure 13: Permanent speed board  on entry to the\
  \ Wellington Freight T erminal  \n3.31 The train was travelling at 25 km/h when\
  \ the driver reduced power to slow the train to \n20 km/h, what they unde rstood\
  \ was the maximum authorised line speed, at the same \ntime as wagon UKK9599 derailed.\
  \   \n3.32 The Commission determined that the marginal difference between the actual\
  \ train \nspeed and the posted line speed was unlikely to have contributed to the\
  \ derailment .  \n \n37 Variations in cant over a base length of 12 m.  \n\n \n\
