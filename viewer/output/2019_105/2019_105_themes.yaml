- name: Track Geometry and Alignment
  explanation: Track geometry and alignment is a critical safety theme as it pertains to the physical condition and configuration of the railway track, which can directly influence the risk of derailment. In this accident, the track alignment was identified as a contributing factor to the derailment. The curve radius leading up to the point of derailment (POD) was "significantly tighter than the absolute minimum prescribed in the current standard" (3.12), and when combined with other track defects and the absence of lubrication on the rail, it likely contributed to the derailment (3.12). Furthermore, the track faults identified during a routine inspection were closed out without repair (4.2), indicating a lapse in maintaining the track geometry within safe operational limits.
- name: Wheel/Rail Interface
  explanation: The wheel/rail interface is a safety theme that involves the interaction between the train wheels and the rail, which is fundamental to safe railway operations. In this incident, the wheel flange surface roughness of the wagon was found to be outside the specified limits, "exceeding the maximum permitted by a factor of two to four" (3.23). This increased friction at the wheel/rail interface and, in combination with the track geometry issues, increased the likelihood of a wheel climb derailment (3.24). The condition of the wheel/rail interface is thus directly relevant to the accident as it was a factor that increased the risk of derailment.
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Compliance
  explanation: Maintenance and inspection compliance is a safety theme that involves adhering to established standards and schedules for the upkeep and examination of railway equipment and infrastructure. In this case, there were lapses in compliance with maintenance standards. The KiwiRail Mechanical Code specified a maximum wheel flange surface roughness of 12.5 micrometres, but the actual roughness was estimated to be between 25-50 micrometres (3.23). Additionally, track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in accordance with company standards (3.14-3.17), indicating a failure to comply with maintenance and inspection protocols, which is relevant to the accident as it allowed for the persistence of conditions that contributed to the derailment.
- name: Load Distribution and Wagon Design
  explanation: Load distribution and wagon design are safety themes related to how cargo is loaded onto wagons and the design of the wagons themselves, which can affect the stability of the train. In this accident, wagon UKK9599 was carrying an evenly loaded, 40-foot container (3.28), and no load imbalance was identified (3.28). However, the design of the UKK-class wagon, when conveying a 40-foot container, slightly reduced the wagon's ability to negotiate long-wheelbase track twists (3.29). This theme is relevant because the ability of the wagon to negotiate the track safely was at the limit, contributing to the derailment (4.2).
- name: Speed Management
  explanation: Speed management is a safety theme that involves controlling the speed of the train to ensure it is appropriate for the track conditions and operational environment. In this incident, the train was traveling at 25 km/h when the driver reduced power to slow the train to what they understood was the maximum authorised line speed of 20 km/h, coinciding with the derailment of wagon UKK9599 (3.31). Although the Commission determined that the speed was unlikely to have contributed to the derailment (3.32), speed management remains a relevant safety theme as it is a critical factor in the safe operation of trains and the prevention of accidents.
- name: Organisational Safety Culture
  explanation: Organisational safety culture is a safety theme that encompasses the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. The report indicates that KiwiRail could not provide evidence that certain track faults had been inspected and repaired by the target dates (3.15, 3.17), and the fault had been recorded as closed out without inspection or repair (3.15). This suggests issues with the safety culture within the organisation, as proper procedures for addressing safety issues were not followed. The relevance of this theme to the accident is underscored by the fact that unaddressed track faults and wheel condition were contributing factors to the derailment (4.2).
