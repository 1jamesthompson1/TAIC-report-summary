- The track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in accordance with company standards. The KiwiRail Track Geometry Standard T-ST-AM-5120 required the Class 1** line fault to be inspected and verified within three days, a 40 km/h temporary speed restriction to apply during the inspection and repairs to be completed within 14 days. If it were not possible to achieve the repair within this timeframe, a process was required to manage the fault until the repair could be made.
- The wagon was authorised to return to service following a routine maintenance inspection with wheel flange surface roughness outside specified limits.
