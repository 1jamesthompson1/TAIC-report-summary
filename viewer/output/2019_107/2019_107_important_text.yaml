  \ train into a section of track occupied by an \nauthorised train is a serious incident.\
  \  While the likelihood of a head -on collision at \nWellington Station  has been\
  \ assessed as low, the potential consequences have been  \nassessed as major.  A\
  \ head -on collision between two opposing trains, even at relatively \nlow speeds,\
  \ has the potential for serious injury to persons and significant damage to \nequipment.\
  \  \n3.2 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event\
  \ to identify \nthose factors that increased the likelihood of the event occurring\
  \ or increased the \nseverity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues\
  \  that have the potential to \nadversely affect future operations.  \nExperience\
  \ and distraction  \n3.3 The Melli ng driver had recently successfully completed\
  \ an eight -month -long \ncommuter train driving course  that included the appropriate\
  \ training for managing \ndistraction.  Also included as part of the driving course\
  \ were 250 hours of supervised \nMatangi train driving around the We llington rail\
  \ network. With just over three weeks of \nsolo driving experience, the newly certified\
  \ driver was still  relatively  inexperienced  in \nthe role.  \n3.4 Key attributes\
  \ of a good train driver include their being able to focus and avoid \ndistract\
  \ ion at critical times  successfully , and an ability to prioritise at high-risk\
  \ areas \nsuch as platforms, level crossings and signals , especially in complex\
  \ areas like the \napproaches to Wellington Station .  \n3.5 Anti-distraction techniques\
  \ demonstrated to drivers during training include d utilising \nthe Signal Alert\
  \ button, However, i t was not mandatory to use the Signal Alert button.  \n3.6\
  \ As the 13 17 Melling service departed Wellington, the driver correctly noted that\
  \ the \ntrain was departing on a Yellow -Caution signal and expected to have to\
  \ stop the train \nat the next signal , which would likely be Red -Stop.  \n3.7\
  \ However, the driver recalled that after t he train passed the Yellow -Caution\
  \  signal  they \nbecom e distracted by  an overheard  radio conversation between\
  \ a train and a work site \non the Johnsonville line.  \n3.8 Distraction  can lead\
  \ to prioritis ing the wrong thing . In this incident the distraction was \nat a\
  \ critical time when the train was approaching a Red -Stop signal  in the congested\
  \ \nWellington Station area . \nControls to  minimise the risk of  a SPAD leading\
  \ to a collision  in the \nWellington Station area  \n3.9 The purpose and design\
  \ of railway signalling is to direct rail traffic , to prevent unsafe \nconditions\
  \ , to provide  adequate separation between trains , and to prevent conflicting\
  \ \nmovements.  Signalling system s incorporate controls to prevent  collision s\
  \ occurring .  \n \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -107 3.10 The congested\
  \ nature of the Wellington Station  track layout means there is a higher  \nrisk\
  \ of trains colliding in this area compared with other areas of the network . \n\
  3.11 On 15 January 2019, partly in response  to the Commission's 2017 recommendation18,\
  \ \nWaka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (Waka Kotahi)  advised KiwiRail and Transdev\
  \ \nWellington that no increase in the frequency of services would be allowed into\
  \ and out \nof Wellington above the existing peak service level without a safety\
  \ case19 variation \napproved by Waka Kotahi . The safety case variation a pplication\
  \ would have to address \nthe current risks of train collisions within the Wellington\
  \ approaches . \n3.12 Of the risk controls in place at the time of the incident\
  \ , both the speed limit and the \ncrashworthiness of the vehicles  reduced the\
  \ severity of the consequ ences should a \ncollision occur. T he signal s reduced\
  \ the likelihood of a SPAD occurring, but were \ndependent on a train driver responding\
  \ to them. As such, the controls in place to \nprevent a collision were primarily\
  \  dependent on train drivers observing a nd responding  \nto the circumstances\
  \ . With distraction  and incapacitation  being  known  and foreseeable  \nrisks,\
  \ these controls have the potential to be ineffective .  \n3.13 Another  control\
  \ commonly used to minimise  the risk of collision  is a fail -safe back -up \n\
  system  that automatically activate s train brakes in situations like SPADs ; this\
  \ may \ninclude simple mechanical devices like train -stops used elsewhere in the\
  \ Wellington \nStation approaches . Fail-safe systems require safety overlaps to\
  \ function effectively, \nproviding adequate space for trains to stop between signals\
  \ . Some of the signal s in the \nWellington approaches had these systems, but signal\
  \ 100 was not one of them . Many \nof the signals without these systems in the Wellington\
  \ approaches do not have enough  \nsafety overlap  to allow them to be effective.\
  \   \n3.14 At Wellington Station  there is a relatively high number of signals and\
  \ points in a small \nand geographical ly constrained area, providing insufficient\
  \ space to fac ilitate the \nrequired overlaps  readily . Due to the complex and\
  \ congested nature of the approaches \nto Wellington Station , retro -engineering\
  \ safety overlaps into the existing track layout is \nnot easy or straightforward\
  \ , and requires significant thought, evalu ation and \ninvestment.  \n3.15 As a\
  \ result of previous recommendations made by the Commission in relation to the \n\
  risks surrounding the Wellington Station approaches, a number of key signals in\
  \ the \nWellington Station area have already been fitted with fail-safe mech anisms\
  \ such as \ntrain-stops that prevent or minimise the severity of a train passing\
  \ a signal at Red -\nStop. In addition, since 2016 (see Section 5) KiwiRail and\
  \ Greater Wellington Regional \nCouncil have undertaken work to determine the best\
  \ long -term solution  in the \ncomplex and congested approaches to Wellington Station.\
  \  \n3.16 However , this incident highlights that more needs to be done in the short\
  \ term to \nensure that other key signals  within the section of track approaching\
  \ Wellington \nStation, such as signal 100  (the signal that was overrun by the\
  \ Melling service ), have \nappropriate engineering solutions to mitigate the risk\
  \ of collision s. \n \n18 Transport Accident Investigation Commission report RO\
