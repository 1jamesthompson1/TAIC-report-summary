- safety_issue: 'The newly certified Melling train driver''s relative inexperience and the potential for distraction at critical times, such as approaching signals in the congested Wellington Station area, increases the risk of incidents.

- safety_issue: 'The reliance on train drivers to observe and respond to signals as the primary control to prevent collisions, given known and foreseeable risks such as distraction and incapacitation, has the potential to be ineffective.

- safety_issue: 'The lack of fail-safe backup systems, such as automatic train brakes activation in case of SPADs (signals passed at danger), for all signals in the Wellington Station approaches, particularly signal 100 which was overrun by the Melling service, increases the risk of collisions.

- safety_issue: 'The complex and congested nature of the Wellington Station track layout, combined with the geographical constraints that limit the space available to facilitate required safety overlaps for effective fail-safe systems, increases the risk of train collisions.

- safety_issue: 'Despite previous recommendations and some improvements, more needs to be done in the short term to ensure that key signals within the section of track approaching Wellington Station have appropriate engineering solutions to mitigate the risk of collisions.
