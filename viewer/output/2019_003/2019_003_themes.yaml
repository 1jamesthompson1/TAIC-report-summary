- name: Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)
  explanation: Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) is a situation where an airworthy aircraft under the control of the pilot is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle. In this accident, the aircraft descended below the minimum safe altitude and struck the terrain in a straight and level attitude, which is characteristic of a CFIT accident. The pilots were likely unaware of the danger until it was too late, as evidenced by the fact that "the aeroplane struck the terrain at about 4,500 feet (1,371 m) in about a straight and level attitude" (3.1) and the nature of the accident has "the characteristics of a 'controlled flight into terrain' accident" (3.2).
- name: Flight Authorization and Planning Procedures
  explanation: The flight authorization and planning procedures are critical for ensuring that flights are conducted safely and in accordance with the operator's requirements. In this accident, the pilot self-authorized the flight as a 'refresher or rental' without following the operator's procedures that required authorization by a training management instructor. This lack of adherence to the authorization procedures is a significant safety issue because "the pilot did not follow the operator's authorisation procedures" (4.9) and "the operator's flight-authorisation procedures were not sufficiently robust to prevent students and qualified pilots conducting flights without the requisite authorisation from supervising instructors" (4.10).
- name: Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) Adherence
  explanation: Adherence to the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) is essential for preventing CFIT accidents. In this case, the aircraft descended below the MSA for the sector, which was a contributing factor to the accident. The pilots did not effectively validate the new route after deviating from the planned track, leading to a descent below the MSA, as indicated by "the aeroplane was descended below the specified minimum safe altitude for the area in which the aeroplane was being flown" (4.1) and "the aeroplane descending below 7,800 feet, the sector MSA, indicates that an effective validation of the new route was not performed by either pilot" (3.29).
- name: Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS)
  explanation: Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS) are designed to prevent CFIT by alerting pilots of potential terrain conflicts. In this accident, it is very likely that the aeroplane's terrain proximity awareness system was either excessively dimmed or not selected, so the terrain ahead was not displayed during the descent. This safety issue is highlighted by the finding that "it was very likely that the aeroplane's terrain proximity awareness system was either excessively dimmed or not selected" (4.5) and the fact that the aircraft was not equipped with an impending-terrain-collision warning (3.34).
- name: Pilot Experience and Supervision
  explanation: The experience of the pilot and the level of supervision provided are important factors in flight safety. In this accident, the pilot and safety pilot had little experience in night instrument-flight-rules navigation, and the pilot's experience and training status required appropriate supervision that should have been provided by the operator's flight-authorization procedures. The relevance of this theme is evident as "the pilot and safety pilot were appropriately licensed and qualified for the flight, but had little experience in night instrument-flight-rules navigation" (4.7) and "the pilot's experience and training status required appropriate supervision that should have been provided by the operator's flight-authorisation procedures" (4.8).
- name: Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Functionality
  explanation: The functionality of the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is crucial for the timely location of an aircraft following an accident. In this case, the ELT did not function as designed, which is a safety issue because it could affect the speed and effectiveness of search and rescue operations. This is highlighted by the finding that "the emergency locator transmitter did not function as designed" (4.12).
