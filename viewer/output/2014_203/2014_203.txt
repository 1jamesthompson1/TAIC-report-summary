The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may mak e recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of t he occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Com mission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. The Captain M. J. Souza  is a New Zealand -registered purse seine fishing vessel that was 
operating in the Pacific Ocean approximately 650 nautical miles north of Samoa.  
1.2. On 24 August the vessel was engaged in a routine fishing operation when a nylon rope sling 
that was securing one end of the fishing net to the vessel broke.  The weight of the net was then 
transferred to a n approximately  48-millimetre-diameter nylon rope called a safety choker line, 
which was designed to retain the net end in the event of the rope sling failing.  
1.3. The crew rigged another rope to alleviate the load on the safety choker line , then continued to 
close the net around the school of tuna.  Soon after wards  the safety choker lin e broke at a 
bowline knot that had been tied in the rope and recoiled, striking one of the deck crewmembers 
in the head.  The crewmember died instantly.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the safety choker 
rope broke because it was in a deteriorated condition and was further weakened by the bowline 
knot that had been used to attach it to the net end.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that the broken rope was about as likely as not to have begu n its 
life in service at a lower -than -typical breaking load for a rope of that size and construction.  
Howe ver, it could not be determined why , because the rope management plan on board was 
not effectively managing the purchase, storage, inspection and ret irement from service of the 
ropes on board.  
1.6. The Commission also found that the safety management system on board the Captain M. J.  
Souza  provided good guidelines for the management and use of ropes on board.  However, 
neither the crew  nor the  skipper nor shore management were  ensuring that the safety 
management system was being  adequately  followed.  
1.7. The Commission made a recommend ation to the operator of the Captain M. J.  Souza  regarding 
improv ing its internal auditing procedures on board.  
1.8. The key lessons  arising from th is inquiry included: 
 tying a knot in a  fibre  rope will reduce  its strength .  It is therefore important to factor in this 
reduction in strength when tying  a knot  in a rope for a specific operation  
 fibre ropes can fail due to cyclic tension loading, a form of fatigue damage  that can be 
difficult to see in braided ropes.  Mariners must look beyond rope surface appearance 
alone when deciding whether to retire rope s from service.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 25 August 2014 Maritime New Zealand reported a fatal  accident  on board the purse seine3 
fishing  vessel  Capt ain M. J.  Souza .  The Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator  in charge.  
2.2. On 27 August 2014 t wo investigators from the Commission flew to Apia , Samoa,  where the  
Captain  M. J.  Souza  was berthed . In the next three  days the investigators interviewed the 
crewmember s and gathered evidence.  
2.3. A failed rope, a sample rope of similar construction and a sling  were removed  from the vessel 
for forensic  testing . The Commission  engaged Scrase Metallurgical Solutions (SMS) in 
association with Metallurgical and Industrial Consultants Limited  to determin e the failure mode 
of the rope s and sling .  SMS  subcontracted  to Bridon Cookes , which operate s one of New 
Zealand's lar gest and most modern test beds , to conduct rope -related testing.  
2.4. On 21 April 2015 t he Commission obtained a new coil of  rope from a known  supplier of ropes to 
the Capt ain M. J.  Souza , and engaged synthetic  rope specialist , SWOS, based  in the United 
States , to carry out tes ts to determine the rope's  breaking strength . 
2.5. On 26 June 2015 an interview was conducted with the operator's operations manager and 
evidence gathered in support of the investigation    
2.6. On 23 June 2016  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to interested persons . 
The Commission received and considered a substantive submission from the vessel's owne r 
Talleys Group L imited.  Any changes as a result of that submission have been included in this 
final report.   
2.7. The Commission approved the report for publication on 29 September 2016.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Purse seine fishing operation  
3.1.1.  Purse seine fishing aims to  surround a school of fish quickly by means of a large net , then 
impound the fish by closing the bottom of the net.  The net is cast vertically  (Figure  1, 1.1) and 
has buoys attached to a float line at the top to keep the net afloat. The re mainder  of the net is 
then dropped into the water using  a weighted line  (Figure  1, 1.2).  A steel cable4 running 
through a series of purse rings at the lower end of the net is tightened  or pursed  to close the 
bottom of the net and prevent the fish escaping  (Figure 1, 1.3).  
3.1.2.  The operation or 'set' starts by surrounding the school of fish with a net. One end of the net 
remains on board the fishing vessel while the other end is secured on a small boat  called the 
net skiff.  On the master's command the net skiff is launched  from the ship, signalling the start 
of the set.  
3.1.3.  The skiff drags one end of the net into the water and  holds it in position while the vessel quickly 
circles the fish,  paying the net overboard as the vessel  comes around to retrieve the skiff end of 
the net.  The bottom of the net is then closed or pursed, trapping the fish inside.  
3.1.4.  The skiff end of the net is attached to an ortza5 (see Figure s 3 and 4 ). When recovering the net 
from the skiff, the ortza is hauled on board  using a winch6.  When the ortza is within reach , a 
double -braided nylon sling , already attached to the ortza , is secured to a stainless -steel post  on 
the port side of the ship.  The weight of the ortza and the net is transferred  from the winch to 
the post.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  The Captain M. J.  Souza is a New Zealand -registered purse seine fishing vessel that operat es 
predominantly in the Pacific Ocean . 
3.2.2.  On 24 August 2014 the vessel was fishing in the Pacific Ocean about 650 n autical miles north 
of Samoa.   At about 143 0 that  day the crew  detected a school of fish and manoeuvred the 
vessel into position to begin the purs e seine operation.  
3.2.3.  Eight deck crew assembled on the deck and  the skiff was launched .  The crewmembers  
gathered at the forward end  of the upper deck  and stayed clear as the net was payed out.  
3.2.4.  Once the skiff had been manoeuvred into  position the Captain M. J. Souza  circled the fish and 
came back alongside the skiff to retrieve the end of the net .  
3.2.5.  Three crewmembers recovered the ortza  and secured it with a  sling  to a stainless -steel post 
locat ed on the port side of the ship (see Figure 2).  
 
Figure 2 
Location of the choker line  on the upper deck  
3.2.6.  The crew also attached a 48-millimetre (mm) diameter  double -braided nylon rope7 called the 
'safety choker  line' (choker line) to the  ortza as a back up in the event that the sling part ed. 
3.2.7.  One end of the choker line  was attached  to the ortza using  a bowline knot8 (see Figure 5) .  The 
othe r end was attached  to the choker  winch on the st arboard side of the vessel  (see Figure 2) .

8 A bowline knot is used to form a fixed loop at one end of a rope.  

  
 
Final report MO -2014 -203 
<< Page 5 >>
 3.2.8.  Once the sling had been secured to  the post and the choker line attached  to the ortza , the 
winch  operator started pursing in the cables  to close the bottom of the net  (Figure  1, 1.4). 
3.2.9.  About one minute into the pursing operation the sling parted  and the weight of the net pulled 
the ortza outboard until the choker l ine took up the weight of the net.  The ortza was at that 
point close to the sea surface.  
 
Figure 3 
Photo graph  of an ortza on board the Captain M. J.  Souza  
3.2.10.  The winch  operator  stopped the pursing operation as soon as he heard  the sling part.   A 
crewmember  took a spare three -strand  nylon rope , dived into the water and attached one end 
of the rope to the ortza. The other end of the rope was attached to a winch located on the 
forward port side of the upper deck  to provide a better lead to pull the ortza back to the ship's 
side. 
3.2.11.  The surge drum winch  was then  used to raise  the ortza as high as possible.  The weight of the 
ortza and the forward end of the net were  now being shared  between the choker line  and the 
three -strand ed nylon rope . 
3.2.12.  While the ortza was being recovered  the master , stationed at the crow 's nest9, ordered the  
winch  operator  to restart  the pursing ope ration . 
3.2.13.  Five crewmember s stepped  over the choker line , which was  running transversely across the  
upper deck , and walked towards  their stations on the port aft side of the vessel.  They had been  
tasked with releasing dye bombs10 into the water to stop the fish escaping beneath the hull of 
the vessel.  
3.2.14.  Two crew members who crossed ov er the choker line  noticed that it  was unusually tigh t and the 
rope's diameter  appeared to have shrunk .  This indicated  that the rope was under severe strain.  
                                                        
9 A crow's n est is a platform specially designed with protective railing and fitted on the tallest mast of the 
ship, where a crewmember stands and visually scouts for fish.  
10 Dye bombs are bottles of dye released into the sea to stop the fish swimming through as the n et is closed, 
ensuring they do not escape.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 3.2.15.  A few minute s after the pursing operation  had restarted,  the crew heard a loud bang.  T he 
choker line  had parted at or near the bowline knot and snapped backwards , striking  a 
crewmember , one of the deckhand s, in the head .  The deckhand  died instantly.  
 
Figure 4 
Location of the crew and equipment at the time of the accident  
3.2.16.  The vessel's operations manager  was notified of the accident  and gave instructions for the 
vessel to proceed to Western Samoa .  
3.3. Choker line  and sling  
3.3.1.  The choker line11 was of double -braided nylon12 construction  and about 48 mm average  
diameter.   One end of the rope was attached to the choker  winch (Figure 2 ) while the  other end 
was attached  to the ortza by a bowline knot .  The choker line  was a  back up for the sling and 
intended to support the weight of the ortza and the forward end of the net  if the sling failed.  
3.3.2.  The ortza  end of the choker line  had originally had an eye splice13, which had parted a few 
weeks  prior to the ac cident.  The broken eye splice was  replaced with a bowline knot  before the 
same choker line was  put back into service , which was a departure from the procedures 
outlined in the Talleys safe working practice document.  
                                                        
11 The SMS/Metallurgical and Industrial Consultants report (Appendix 1) initially identified the choker line to 
be consistent with a double -braided polyester rope, but on further inspection confirmed that the choke r line 
was of double -braided nylon construction.  
12 The rope consisted of a braided inner core and a braided outer sheath.  
13 An eye splice is a method of creating a permanent loop in the end of multi -stranded rope by means of 
splicing.

3.3.3.  The sling was of double -braided nylon rope construction , about 50.8 mm in diameter  and 
spliced14 together at the ends to form a loop.  The sling was only a few weeks  old at the time of 
the accident . 
3.4. Rope testing  
3.4.1.  The Commission  retained the broken choker line , the broken sling and a reported new sample 
rope from on board  the ship . 
3.4.2.  SMS was engaged by the Commission to examine the choker line , sling and new ropes and  
determine the cause of the failure.  
Choker line  inspection and testing  
3.4.3.  SMS  made the following observations in its report  (Appendix 1 ): 
The incident break started at approximately the same axial location all around 
the circumference of the rope, indicated by the red rectangle in Figure 2a  [Figure 
7]. No evidence of deliberate cutt ing, as might have occurred with a k nife for 
example, was observed.  No evidence of severe or localised abrasion was 
observed on the outer strand fib res. 
Deconstruction of the ropes for testing confirmed that they were of a double 
braid type with a braided cover over a braided core.  
The general damage morphology of the choker line  was consistent with 
predominantly cyclic tension loa ding, a form of fatigue15 damage.  
It is clear from the evidence that the choker line  was in a deteriorated condition 
at the time it broke. Visual examination of the rope revealed extreme cyclic 
tension damage and the outer surface also resembled abrasion category 5 -6. 
The ultimate failure was most likely caused by overload of the remaining 
relatively intact strands, after many fibre s had already broken in service. This  in 
service damage substantially reduced the strength of the rope, to the point that 
it exhibited a small fraction of its original breaking strength.

The choker line  could not be tested as a complete rope, owing to its condition 
and the sample being too short to accommodate effective splicing, which is 
required to attach the rope to the testing equipment  [the length of  the recovered 
choker line  was 3.7 metres ; the min imum length required to attach the rope to 
the testing equipment was about 7 metres] .  Instead, testing was performed on 
strands removed from the ropes, in accordance with international standard BS 
EN ISO 2307.  This standard allows the testing of de-stranded ropes and applies 
a correction factor in a calculation of the realised breaking load17 of the full -
thickness rope.

cyclic stresses.  
17 The realised breaking load  of a rope is the calculated, approximate breaking load of the intact rope, using 
an adjustment factor, after having breaking -load tested individual strands of the rope .

 3.4.4.  The realised breaking load of the choker line  was 10 ,036 kilograms ( kg), which is about 19% of 
the expected breaking load of 52 ,752 kg18( 116300 Pounds) (see Appendix 2 for details of the 
referenced standard) . 
3.4.5.  The report also estimated that the bowline knot further reduced the breaking load of the already 
weakened rope by about 33% , indicating that the breaking strength of the choker line  may have 
been as low as 6 ,700 kg at the time of the accident . 
Testing methodology and limitations  
3.4.6.  Owing to the condition of the damaged choker line and the  difficulty of disassembling it, there is 
a possibility that the n umber of strands identified in the inner core of the choker line was 24, 
not 25 as identified in  the test report (see Appendix 1) .  If the number of strands in the core was 
24 and the average strength s of the outer braid strands and core braid strands were  calculated 
separately , then the r ealised breaking load may have been as low as 8 ,584 kg , which is about 
16% of the expected breaking load of 52,752 kg.   
3.4.7.   When the choker line parted at the bowline knot it recoiled.  The Commission was unable to 
quantify what effect this had on the condition of the rope .  
Inspection and testing of the  sling  
3.4.8.  The following observations were made in the test report ( see Appendix 1 for details ). 
The strands were relatively intact at their initial separation but the fibres became 
more separated  from each other t owards the ends of the strands.  
The gene ral outside condition o f the rope appeared to be relativ ely free from 
damage, compared with the choker line , but exhibited some broken fibres 
protruding from the otherwise  smooth surface . The sling had a very soft and 
supple feel. It could easily be squeezed in the circumferential direction  by hand 
and move axially.  
The rope had 4 tying cords  at vari ous locations along its length  [refer Figure 8].  
Two of these had been made by tightly wrapping a nd finally tying many turns of 
black cord around the rope and these tw o cords appeared to be intact. The other 
two were loose and did not constrict the rope s ignificantly. The core could easily 
be pulled out of the cover except where the two tight constrictions held it.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 Inspection and testing of a brand -new sample rope from a known supplier of ropes to the 
Captain M . J. Souza   
3.4.9.  The Commission contracted SWOS, synthetic rope testing experts  based in the United States , to 
test a new two -inch (50.8mm) , double -braided nylon rope manufactured by a known supplier of 
ropes to the Capt ain M. J. Souza . To test the rope, it was cut into three lengths. Each length had 
an eye splice at both ends. The t est results showed that the ropes parted at an average 
breaking load of 53,8700 kg , which was more than the Cordage Institute  standard's expected 
breaking load of 52,752 kg (see Appendix 3 for details) .  
Inspection and testing of a reported new sample rope  of similar construction to the choker line , 
sourced from on board the Captain M . J. Souza  
3.4.10.  The sample rope was 3 2 metre s in length  and sourced from on board the Captain M. J.  Souza .  
Visually the rope appeared to be in good condition compared with the choker line , but there was 
some indication of possible  crushing and  heat damage ( see Figure 9).  To test it, t he rope was 
cut into five lengths , each six metre s long.   Two lengths had an eye splice at one end and a 
bowline knot at the other end.  The remai ning three pieces had eye splices  at both ends.  
Testing methodology and limitations  
3.4.11.  Owing to the elastic nature of the double -braided nylon rope, the rope's elongation during 
testing exceeded the maximum t ravel of the hydraulic ram that was used to stretch it to its 
breaking point .  There was no testing equipment with appropriate test result graphing capability 
available in New Zealand that had a hydraulic ram of sufficient size .  Therefore a  low preten sion 
load had to be applied at the early stag es of testing  to take up some stretch  in each sample 
rope .  A rope expert engaged by Talleys  stated that this method may have produced inaccurate 
results .  However , the opinion of the rope expert  who conducted the tests  was that 
pretensioning of the rope would have been very unlikely to introduce any  appreciable error  to 
the final test results.   The Commission acknowledges the views of both experts.  However, any 
error resulting from pre -tensioning the test rope during the test procedure is not significant to 
the result, which was that the rope failed at less than half its expected breaking load.  The test 
results are tabled below:

 Final report MO -2014 -203 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  There are more than  1,200 New Zealand -registered commercial fishing vessels engaged in 
coastal and deep -sea fishing operations.  Commercial fishing is a high -risk occupation that 
often takes place in a hostile and unpredictable environment , and inv olves  working on the deck 
in the vicinity of winches, ropes and cables in tension.   
4.1.2.  The purse  seine  fishing vessel  Capt ain M. J.  Souza  was one of nine deep -sea fishing vess els 
operated by  Amaltal Fishing Company Limited .  At the time of the accident  the vessel  was 
transitioning  from the now -redundant Safe Ship Management  (SSM) system  to the new 
Maritime Operator Safety S ystem admini stered by Maritime New Zealand.  
4.1.3.  The anal ysis discusses why the choker line  and sling parted , the effectiveness of internal 
audits19 in detecting and preventing deficiencies, the importance of having a rope management 
plan and the effect of fatigue on fibre ropes.   
4.2. Why did the sling and  choker line  fail? 
4.2.1.  The breaking load tests conducted on the choker line  show ed that the realis ed breaking 
strength of the choker line  may have been as low as 6 ,700 kg, which is significantly lower tha n 
the typical 52 ,700 kg breaking strength of a new 50.8  mm double -braided nylon rope20 (see 
Appendix 2) .   
4.2.2.  SMS  observed in its report  (Appendix  1) that the damage sustained by the choker line  was 
generally consistent  with fatigue dama ge, but t he ultimate failure was most likely caused by 
overload ing the remaining intact strands.  
4.2.3.  The report referred to f atigue as "the weakening of a material subject to cyclic stresses ". The 
material , in this case a fibre rope,  typically fails at an intensity considerably below its normal 
breaking  strength .  The SMS report state d: 
It is clear from the evidence that the choker line was in a deteriorated condition 
at the ti me it broke. Visual examination of the rope revealed extreme cyclic 
tension damage and the outer surface also resembled abrasion category 5 -6. 
The ultimate failure was most likely caused by overload of the remaining 
relatively intact strands, after many fi bres had already broken in service. This in 
service damage substantially reduced the strength to the rope, to the point that 
it exhibited a small fraction of its original breaking strength.  
4.2.4.  A rope of the diameter and construction of the choker rope has th ousands of individual strands .  
A number  of broken strands within  the core of  a rope is an indication that it is fatigued.  The 
greater the percentage of broken to intact strands, the more  advanced  the stage of fatigue of 
the rope.  Although the number of unbroken strands can give the appearance that the rope is 
still in good condition, th e remaining unbroken strands will have a reduced strength due to 
cyclic fatigue . 
4.2.5.  When using a rope on  board a ship it is important to know how long a rope can be safely us ed 
before fatigue sets in and degrades the rope's load -bearing capacity.  The problem with braided -
fibre rope that has an outer sheath is that it is virtually impossible to detect broken strands 
within its core, making it difficult to assess its overall co ndition  visually .  Therefore other means 
of assessing when to retire a rope from use are needed.  The fatigue life of a rope can be 
predicted by modelling the life of the rope based on the load applied to it and the frequency of 
usage.

proper use of industry products through the dissemination of standards.  
  
 
Final report MO -2014 -203 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.2.6.  SMS also found that the bowline knot on the choker line  may have considerably reduced the 
strength of an already weakened rope.  A National Transportation Safety Board safety alert 
(http://go.usa.gov/9e6P ) reported th at the strength reduction due to a bowline knot tied in a 
rope may be as much as 70 %, even on a brand -new rope.  These studies were based on nylon 
rope of much smaller diameter than the choker rope.  The SMS report considered a strength 
reduction of as muc h as 33% for the l arger ropes tested in this case.  
4.2.7.  It is not possible to say definitely what the actual strain on the choker rope was when it broke  
on board the vessel .  It was necessary to use the realised breaking load method for testing the 
rope because  there was insufficient rope to conduct a full breaking test.  This  method has a 
recognised limitation in accur acy.  Also, it is not possible to say with any accuracy what the 
effect of using a bowline knot had on breaking strength.  
The sling

4.2.8.  The sling failed at the splice.  The SMS report state d that  it was difficult to determine whether 
the splic e had been  constructed  in accordance with general industry guidelines . However,  the 
presence of the tying cords21 (see Figure 10) suggested  that it had not .  The report also state d 
that there were breaks at both ends , not straight cuts , indicating that a splice might have come 
apart gradually while in service. The sling then most likely experienced loads sufficient to  cause 
the observe d predominantly tensile breaks22.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 Findings 
1. The choker line broke , partly because it was in a deteriorated condition caused 
by extreme cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion , and partly 
because the bowline knot almost certainly caused a reduction in breaking 
strength.  
2. The rope  that was used to make the  sling was reasonably new and in good 
condition .  It is likely  that the sling failed due to the splice coming apart in 
service, to a point where the strands ultimately parted under tensile load.  
4.3. Rope management plan 
4.3.1.  At the time of the accident  there was no formal recording or registering  of ropes on  board  the 
Captain M. J. Souza  and there was no requirement to do so.   There was some generic advice on 
rope care in its Safe Working Practice s document23, but essentially the inspection and 
requisition of ropes were  delegated to the ship's bosun .  The shore management relied on the 
bosun's judgement  and the skipper's oversigh t when evaluating the condition of ropes on board 
and making recommendations for  the further use  of those ropes .   
4.3.2.  It was reasonable to expect a person  to be competent in examining the condition of a rope  for 
what they could  see.  However, as mentioned abo ve, visual examination alone will not provide a 
robust  measure of rope deterioration.  Guidelines on when to retire a rope from service as part 
of a rope management plan could have assisted the crew  in this regard.  
4.3.3.  The company safety management system refe rence d the Cordage Institute standard as a 
guideline.  The Cordage Institute  state s that an important tool for rope evaluation is a log, which 
includes data on the type of rope  and the time in service and description s of the intended use 
and the established retirement criteria. The Cordage Institute  also suggest s that  details of every 
inspection be entered into the log.  
4.3.4.  At the time of the accident  there was no log or retirement standard documented in the safe ship 
management documents kept on  board the ship .   
4.3.5.  The choker line  and a reported new sample rope of similar construction  were removed from on 
board for testing and examination . The test results showed that the  choker line  was only about 
19% of the expected breaking load  (52,700 kg ) and the sample ro pe, which appeared to be in 
relatively good condition , was only about 40% of  the expected breaking load .    
4.3.6.  There are a number of possible reasons for the reported new sample rope suffer ing a significant 
reduction in its strength.  Manufacturing inconsistencies , ultraviolet degradation,  heat abrasion, 
damage from previous usage  and exposure to water or chemicals  are all possible reasons . 
4.3.7.  Neither the crew nor shore management were able to determine with any  certainty  the origin of 
the choker line  and the reported ly new sample rope. They were also unable to determine 
whether both the ropes originated from the same coil.   There was no record of how long the 
choker line  had been in use or how long ropes should be used prior to retirement .  
Consequently t he origin of the sample rope was not able to be traced . 
4.3.8.  If the choker line originated from the same coil from which the sample was taken, it is very likely 
that it starte d its life in service at about  40% of the expected breaking load.  The onset of 
fatigue due to cyclic tension was therefore very likely to ha ve been accelerated because the 
ratio of the rope 's breaking load to the normal service loads would have been signi ficantly 
lower.

create a safe worki ng environment. The document is to be read in conjunction with the vessel's Safe Ship 
Management manual . 
  
 
Final report MO -2014 -203 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.3.9.  Since the accident  the operator has started a rope register to log ropes ' usage.  
Findings  
3. The rope management plan on board the Captain M.  J. Souza  was not 
effectively managing the purchase , storage, inspection and retirement from 
service of the ropes on board.  
4. It is about  as likely as not that the choker rope that broke  on board the Captain 
M. J.  Souza  began its life in service at a lower -than -typical breaking load for a 
rope of that size and construction.  
4.4. Ship safety m anagement  system  
4.4.1.  At the time of the accident the Captain M. J.  Souza  was transitioning its safety management 
from the now redundant SSM system to the new Maritime Operator Safety System administered 
by Maritime New Zealand.  Under the SSM code a ship's owner was required to engage a 
Maritime New Zealand -approved organisation to administer its SSM system.  The Maritime 
Operator Safety System was introduced on 1 July 2014, about two months prior to this 
accident.  On 1 July 2014 any vessel with a valid SSM certificate received a 'deemed' Maritime 
Transport Operator Certificate.  At the time of the accident  the Captain M. J.  Souza  held a valid 
deemed Maritime Transport Operator Certificate.  
4.4.2.  The Safe Ship Management documents  provided extensive guidance on the safe working 
practic es expected on board the ship, including working with various types of rope and twine 
and the breaking characteristics of synthetic ropes.  All crewmembers were required to ensure 
that ropes were in good condition and had strength appropriate to their appl ication s.  Ropes 
were to be examined for abrasions and  broken, deteriorated or displaced fibres.  
4.4.3.  Maritime rule Part 21 required an SSM organisation24 to carry out an external audit of a ship 
prior to it gaining a n SSM certificate.  A subsequent external aud it was required as part of the 
SSM certificate renewal process to ensure the vessel's continued compliance with the 
requirements of the  SSM code25.  In addition to the external audit requirements,  the Captain M. 
J. Souza  was internally audited by the vessel 's shore  managers when it berthed in New Zealand 
or American Samoa while discharging cargo.  
4.4.4.  The operator said that internal audits were conducted several times each year.  An internal 
audit would normally consist of a 'walk around' the vessel and  the subsequent compilation of a 
work list in consultation with the master and crew. The work list was actioned at the vessel's 
next suitable port of call.  
4.4.5.  An internal audit is a good tool for measuring the effectiveness of safety management 
implementation on board a ship.  However, to be effective an audit should be well documented, 
deficiencies should be clearly identified  and corrective action s agreed , and progress should be 
monitored until deficienc ies have been closed out.  
4.4.6.  However, the operator was unable to produce documents for the audits, such as findings and 
any safety actions taken as a result of the audits.  Lack of audit documentation had been  an 
observation  made during the previous  SSM renewal audit in 2012 by the or ganisation 
responsible for administering the vessel's S SM system.  
4.4.7.  The Captain M. J.  Souza  was 35 years old at the time of the accident. There is evidence to 
suggest that the upkeep of the vessel was a matter of priority for the owners.  For example, the 
SSM organisation was contracted by the owner to inspect the vessel annually , even though the 
SSM code only required surveys to be carried out twice in every five -year period.

<< Page 16 >>
 Final report MO -2014 -203 4.4.8.  The Safe Working Practices document, which was part of the ship's SSM system, was r egularly 
updated and covered vessel -specific activity.   The following extracts contained in the Safe 
Working Practices document are relevant to this accident . 
Crewmembers should be familiar with the various types of ropes and twines and 
their special uses on board and in particular with the breaking characteristics of 
synthetic ropes .  
Crewmembers should always ensure that they use ropes only for the purpose for 
which they are intended. Care should be taken that all ropes in use are in good 
condition and ha ve strength appropriate to their application.  
Ropes should be examined frequently for abrasions and broken , deteriorated or 
displaced fibres or strand and other defects.  
A splice should be used where possible in place of a knot, which weakens rope 
to a gr eater extent.  
During the handling of mooring lines or other wires or ropes, crewmembers 
should take care not to stand in a bight26. 
During the pursing operation, crewmembers should avoid standing in a position 
where they will be endangered should a wire br eak out from a sheave or roller 
for any reason.  
4.4.9.  However , contrary to the Safe Working Practices document : 
 There were no documents on board to confirm the origin of the choker line and sample 
rope, or how long these ropes had been on board . 
 The reported new sample of rope removed from  the vessel was tested and found to break 
at an average breaking load of 22 ,993 kg, less than half of its expected breaking load of 
about 52 ,752 kg . 
 The choker line  had broken a few weeks previously while in  use.  The failed rope  was in 
poor condition and should have been replaced , but instead  it was put back into service . 
 The broken splice at the end of the rope was replaced with a bowline knot . 
 The location on deck  where the crew routinely stood to th row dye bombs into the water was  
within the swinging radius of the  choker line, which could come under sudden tension in 
the event of the sling failing . 
4.4.10.  The operator's  Safe Work ing Practice s document covered five  topics that included safety on 
deck and saf ety in fishing operations.  It described purse seining as a particularly dangerous 
method of fishing and outlined steps  to reduce the risk of an accident. The document advised 
crew to avoid standing in positions where they would be endangered should a wire  break out 
from a sheave or roller, and also to take care not to stand in the bight of a rope.  
4.4.11.  However,  given the position  from which  the crew  were  required to stand and throw  dye bombs 
into the water, this was practically unachievable ( see Figure 4) . 
4.4.12.  The Captain M. J.  Souza  had procedures and instructions for carrying out fishing operations 
safely, which included not standing in the vicinity of ropes.  However, the instruction was 
generic and did not discuss vessel -specific risks , which in this case should  have included the 
inherent risks faced by the person tasked with releasing dye bombs.  
4.4.13.  Since the accident  the operator of the vessel has mitigated the risk s by changing the location of 
the choker line . In doing so it has  been moved  away from the position where crewmember s 
would be expected to stand when releas ing dye  bombs into the water.

 Finding  
5. The safety management system on board the Captain M. J.  Souza  provided 
good guidelines for the management and use of ropes on board.  However, 
neither the crew  nor the  skipper nor shore management were  ensuring that the 
safety management system was being adequately followed.  
  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final report MO -2014 -203 5. Findings  
5.1. The choker line broke , partly because it was in a deteriorated condition caused by extreme 
cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion , and partly because the bowline knot 
almost certainly caused a reduction in breaking strength.  
5.2. The rope that was used to make the  sling was reasonably new and in good condition.  It is likely 
that the sling failed due to the splice comin g apart in service, to a point where the strands 
ultimately parted under tensile load.  
5.3. The rope management plan on board the Captain M.  J. Souza  was not effectively managing the 
purchase, storage, inspection and retirement from service of the ropes on boa rd. 
5.4. It is about as likely as not that the choker rope that broke on board the Captain M. J.  Souza  
began its life in service at a lower -than -typical breaking load for a rope of that size and 
construction.  
5.5. The safety management system on board the Captain M. J. Souza  provided good guidelines for 
the management and use of ropes on board.  However, neither the crew  nor the skipper nor 
shore management were ensuring that the safety management system was being adequately 
followed.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified by 
the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
Safety action taken by the operator of the Captain M. J.  Souza   
6.2. Since the accident  the operator of the Captain M. J.  Souza  has mitigated the risk of the choker 
line parting and striking crewmember s by removing the rope from its current location and 
attachi ng it closer to the net and away from the position where crewmember s would stand while 
releasing dye bombs into the water . 
6.3. The operator of the Captain M. J.  Souza  has started a rope register to identify the various ropes 
on board the ship and log their usa ge. This  safety action  partially addresses the safety issue  
relating to the requirement for an appropriate rope manage ment system on board the ship.  
6.4. The operator has reported that it has  increased oversight of the vessel at turnarounds.  
6.5. The operator contracted a consultant to carry out a comprehensive safety systems audit and 
report findings to management.  
6.6. The operator  updated the on -board Hazard Register to include the following amended sections.  
It is necessary that gear be checked on a regular basis and that as far as 
possible, crewmembers remain out of the likely path of travel of breaking gear, 
referred to as the Snap Back Zone.  
Try and anticipate where the force will go if a rope or line breaks.  This area is 
referred to as the 'Sna p Back Zone' and crew should be aware of where these 
zones are during fishing and other operations.  Normally a rope or line under 
tension snaps back with a corkscrew motion - so stay out of the direct line of pull.  
Never apply tension to a kinked wire or  line. 
Splices are much stronger than knots and should be properly matched to the 
lines or ropes with which they will be used.  Listen for warning sounds that 
indicate excessive strain.   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.7. None identified.

 Final report MO -2014 -203 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, a recom mendation has been issued to Talleys Group Limited , with notice of 
this recommendation given to Talleys Group Limited . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that this recommendation is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. Despite internal audits being carried out several times each year, a damaged rope was reused 
and a bowline knot used to replace a broken splice. These were clear departures from the SSM  
system guidelines.   Also, t he instructions and guidel ines available on the SSM  system did not 
adequately address the issue of rope fatigue  and the requirement s for a retirement criterion 
and a  usage log.   
7.3.1.  On 29 September 2016  the Commission recommended that the operator of the Captain M. J.  
Souza : review its internal auditing procedures to ensure  that auditors make realistic 
assessment s based on actual practices  observed on board ; and  seek verification that 
documented procedures are being followed by the crew and the y are appropriate for the task .  
Audit findings should be recorded together with  any safety actions  taken as a result of the audit . 
(020/16)  
On 20 October 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Talleys Group Limited replied:  
Since August 2014 we have implemented a programme to improve the Health and 
Safety culture on this vessel.  This started wit an internal review of our Health and 
Safety Systems (ashore and on board) governing the Capt M J Souza  and following 
that review, w e have taken several steps to improve Health and Safety outcomes 
which include:  
1. Heightened oversight of the documented H & S procedures on the vessel at 
turnarounds by the vessel manager and operations manager including 
debriefing key staff on the vessel o n H & S compliance and addressing any new 
hazards that may have been identified during the trip;  
2. Implementation of a revised assurance process on the vessel and ashore to 
provide evidence to shore based management that Talley's H&S protocols in 
fact being applied on board the vessel;  
3. We have provided additional third party H & S training to the officers and crew of 
the vessel to ensure that they are aware of Talley's health and safety 
procedures, the hazards associated with their tasks and that they are ope rating 
safely;  
4. Addressed and improved communication structures between senior 
management and senior vessel staff;  
5. Setting out company expectations regarding H & S aboard the vessel and the 
consequences of departure from these expectations;  
Further, when th e vessel returns to NZ after its current Pacific Season in December 
2016, we have identified an independent Health and Safety expert who will take a 
trip on the vessel to audit its compliance and to report to management on the H&S 
culture on the vessel, th eir compliance with the Talley's  & S programme and 
thereafter, if appropriate to put in place an effective change management 
programme.

 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Tying a knot in a fibre rope will reduce its strength .  It is therefore important to factor  in this 
redu ction in rope  strength when selecting a knot and rope for a specific operation.  
8.2. Fibre ropes can fail due to cyclic tension loading, a form of fatigue damage  that can be difficult 
to see in braided ropes.  Mariners must look beyond rope surface appearance a lone when 
deciding whether to retire rope s from service.
