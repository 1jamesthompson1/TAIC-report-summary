- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0

    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that the crew and shore management did not ensure that the safety management system was being adequately followed ("neither the crew nor the skipper nor shore management were ensuring that the safety management system was being adequately followed" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote))). This suggests that human error and assumptions about the condition and management of the ropes may have contributed to the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While there is no direct mention of inadequate training leading to the accident, the document does suggest that better guidelines on when to retire a rope from service could have assisted the crew, implying a potential gap in training or competency regarding rope management ("Guidelines on when to retire a rope from service as part of a rope management plan could have assisted the crew" (4.3.2)).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not explicitly state that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment was a direct cause of the accident. However, it does mention the importance of knowing how long a rope can be safely used before fatigue sets in, which could be related to familiarity with the equipment's condition ("When using a rope on board a ship it is important to know how long a rope can be safely used before fatigue sets in" (4.2.5)).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of issues related to Crew Resource Management, such as teamwork, communication, decision-making, or leadership skills, contributing to the accident within the provided document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document indicates that safety procedures were not adequately followed, as evidenced by the use of a bowline knot instead of a splice, and the failure to replace a previously broken rope ("The choker line had broken a few weeks previously while in use. The failed rope was in poor condition and should have been replaced, but instead it was put back into service" (4.4.9)).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document suggests that the organizational safety culture may not have been strong enough to ensure adherence to safety procedures and proper management of ropes, as there was no formal recording or registering of ropes on board the vessel ("At the time of the accident there was no formal recording or registering of ropes on board the Captain M. J. Souza" (4.3.1)).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that there was a lack of risk management regarding the rope's condition and management, as there was no rope management plan in place that effectively managed the purchase, storage, inspection, and retirement of ropes on board ("The rope management plan on board the Captain M. J. Souza was not effectively managing the purchase, storage, inspection and retirement from service of the ropes on board" (5.3)).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document mentions that the vessel was transitioning from one safety management system to another and held a valid deemed Maritime Transport Operator Certificate at the time of the accident. However, there is no direct link made between regulatory oversight and compliance and the cause of the accident ("At the time of the accident the Captain M. J. Souza was transitioning its safety management from the now redundant SSM system to the new Maritime Operator Safety System administered by Maritime New Zealand" (4.4.1)).
- name: Situational Awareness

  explanation: 'The document does not discuss emergency response preparedness or its role in the accident, so this theme does not apply to the accident in question.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document highlights the failure to properly inspect and maintain the ropes, as the choker line was in a deteriorated condition and the sling failed at the splice, suggesting inadequate maintenance and inspection regimes ("The choker line broke, partly because it was in a deteriorated condition caused by extreme cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion" (5.1)).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of automation or its impact on the accident within the provided document, so this theme does not apply to the accident in question.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While the document does not explicitly mention communication breakdown as a cause of the accident, the lack of documentation for internal audits and the absence of records regarding the ropes suggest that there may have been communication issues within the organization ("However, the operator was unable to produce documents for the audits, such as findings and any safety actions taken as a result of the audits" (4.4.6)).
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the accident outside of the predefined themes.
