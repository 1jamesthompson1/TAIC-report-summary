  4.1.1.  There are more than  1,200 New Zealand -registered commercial fishing vessels\
  \ engaged in \ncoastal and deep -sea fishing operations.  Commercial fishing is\
  \ a high -risk occupation that \noften takes place in a hostile and unpredictable\
  \ environment , and inv olves  working on the deck \nin the vicinity of winches,\
  \ ropes and cables in tension.   \n4.1.2.  The purse  seine  fishing vessel  Capt\
  \ ain M. J.  Souza  was one of nine deep -sea fishing vess els \noperated by  Amaltal\
  \ Fishing Company Limited .  At the time of the accident  the vessel  was \ntransitioning\
  \  from the now -redundant Safe Ship Management  (SSM) system  to the new \nMaritime\
  \ Operator Safety S ystem admini stered by Maritime New Zealand.  \n4.1.3.  The\
  \ anal ysis discusses why the choker line  and sling parted , the effectiveness\
  \ of internal \naudits19 in detecting and preventing deficiencies, the importance\
  \ of having a rope management \nplan and the effect of fatigue on fibre ropes. \
  \  \n4.2. Why did the sling and  choker line  fail? \n4.2.1.  The breaking load\
  \ tests conducted on the choker line  show ed that the realis ed breaking \nstrength\
  \ of the choker line  may have been as low as 6 ,700 kg, which is significantly\
  \ lower tha n \nthe typical 52 ,700 kg breaking strength of a new 50.8  mm double\
  \ -braided nylon rope20 (see \nAppendix 2) .   \n4.2.2.  SMS  observed in its report\
  \  (Appendix  1) that the damage sustained by the choker line  was \ngenerally consistent\
  \  with fatigue dama ge, but t he ultimate failure was most likely caused by \n\
  overload ing the remaining intact strands.  \n4.2.3.  The report referred to f atigue\
  \ as \"the weakening of a material subject to cyclic stresses \". The \nmaterial\
  \ , in this case a fibre rope,  typically fails at an intensity considerably below\
  \ its normal \nbreaking  strength .  The SMS report state d: \nIt is clear from\
  \ the evidence that the choker line was in a deteriorated condition \nat the ti\
  \ me it broke. Visual examination of the rope revealed extreme cyclic \ntension\
  \ damage and the outer surface also resembled abrasion category 5 -6. \nThe ultimate\
  \ failure was most likely caused by overload of the remaining \nrelatively intact\
  \ strands, after many fi bres had already broken in service. This in \nservice damage\
  \ substantially reduced the strength to the rope, to the point that \nit exhibited\
  \ a small fraction of its original breaking strength.  \n4.2.4.  A rope of the diameter\
  \ and construction of the choker rope has th ousands of individual strands .  \n\
  A number  of broken strands within  the core of  a rope is an indication that it\
  \ is fatigued.  The \ngreater the percentage of broken to intact strands, the more\
  \  advanced  the stage of fatigue of \nthe rope.  Although the number of unbroken\
  \ strands can give the appearance that the rope is \nstill in good condition, th\
  \ e remaining unbroken strands will have a reduced strength due to \ncyclic fatigue\
  \ . \n4.2.5.  When using a rope on  board a ship it is important to know how long\
  \ a rope can be safely us ed \nbefore fatigue sets in and degrades the rope's load\
  \ -bearing capacity.  The problem with braided -\nfibre rope that has an outer sheath\
  \ is that it is virtually impossible to detect broken strands \nwithin its core,\
  \ making it difficult to assess its overall co ndition  visually .  Therefore other\
  \ means \nof assessing when to retire a rope from use are needed.  The fatigue life\
  \ of a rope can be \npredicted by modelling the life of the rope based on the load\
  \ applied to it and the frequency of \nusage.  \n                              \
  \                          \n19 An internal audit is a n examination of a company's\
  \ activities by its own  employees . \n20 Taken from the Cordage Institute  Standard.\
  \  The Cordage Institute is an international association of rope, \ntwine  and related\
  \ manufacturers, their suppliers and affiliated industries. Its mission is to educate\
  \ on the \nproper use of industry products through the dissemination of standards.\
  \  \n  \n \nFinal report MO -2014 -203 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2.6.  SMS also found\
  \ that the bowline knot on the choker line  may have considerably reduced the \n\
  strength of an already weakened rope.  A National Transportation Safety Board safety\
  \ alert \n(http://go.usa.gov/9e6P ) reported th at the strength reduction due to\
  \ a bowline knot tied in a \nrope may be as much as 70 %, even on a brand -new rope.\
  \  These studies were based on nylon \nrope of much smaller diameter than the choker\
  \ rope.  The SMS report considered a strength \nreduction of as muc h as 33% for\
  \ the l arger ropes tested in this case.  \n4.2.7.  It is not possible to say definitely\
  \ what the actual strain on the choker rope was when it broke  \non board the vessel\
  \ .  It was necessary to use the realised breaking load method for testing the \n\
  rope because  there was insufficient rope to conduct a full breaking test.  This\
  \  method has a \nrecognised limitation in accur acy.  Also, it is not possible\
  \ to say with any accuracy what the \neffect of using a bowline knot had on breaking\
  \ strength.  \nThe sling \n \nFigure 10 \nSling with core pulled out, past two ineffective\
  \ constrictions but held by two tight constrictions  \n(Photo courtesy  Scrase Metallurgical\
  \ Solutions)  \n \n4.2.8.  The sling failed at the splice.  The SMS report state\
  \ d that  it was difficult to determine whether \nthe splic e had been  constructed\
  \  in accordance with general industry guidelines . However,  the \npresence of\
  \ the tying cords21 (see Figure 10) suggested  that it had not .  The report also\
  \ state d \nthat there were breaks at both ends , not straight cuts , indicating\
  \ that a splice might have come \napart gradually while in service. The sling then\
  \ most likely experienced loads sufficient to  cause \nthe observe d predominantly\
  \ tensile breaks22. \n  \n                                                     \

  \ \n1. The choker line broke , partly because it was in a deteriorated condition\
  \ caused \nby extreme cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion , and\
  \ partly \nbecause the bowline knot almost certainly caused a reduction in breaking\
  \ \nstrength.  \n2. The rope  that was used to make the  sling was reasonably new\
  \ and in good \ncondition .  It is likely  that the sling failed due to the splice\
  \ coming apart in \nservice, to a point where the strands ultimately parted under\
  \ tensile load.  \n4.3. Rope management plan \n4.3.1.  At the time of the accident\
  \  there was no formal recording or registering  of ropes on  board  the \nCaptain\
  \ M. J. Souza  and there was no requirement to do so.   There was some generic advice\
  \ on \nrope care in its Safe Working Practice s document23, but essentially the\
  \ inspection and \nrequisition of ropes were  delegated to the ship's bosun .  The\
  \ shore management relied on the \nbosun's judgement  and the skipper's oversigh\
  \ t when evaluating the condition of ropes on board \nand making recommendations\
  \ for  the further use  of those ropes .   \n4.3.2.  It was reasonable to expect\
  \ a person  to be competent in examining the condition of a rope  for \nwhat they\
  \ could  see.  However, as mentioned abo ve, visual examination alone will not provide\
  \ a \nrobust  measure of rope deterioration.  Guidelines on when to retire a rope\
  \ from service as part \nof a rope management plan could have assisted the crew\
  \  in this regard.  \n4.3.3.  The company safety management system refe rence d\
  \ the Cordage Institute standard as a \nguideline.  The Cordage Institute  state\
  \ s that an important tool for rope evaluation is a log, which \nincludes data on\
  \ the type of rope  and the time in service and description s of the intended use\
  \ \nand the established retirement criteria. The Cordage Institute  also suggest\
  \ s that  details of every \ninspection be entered into the log.  \n4.3.4.  At the\
  \ time of the accident  there was no log or retirement standard documented in the\
  \ safe ship \nmanagement documents kept on  board the ship .   \n4.3.5.  The choker\
  \ line  and a reported new sample rope of similar construction  were removed from\
  \ on \nboard for testing and examination . The test results showed that the  choker\
  \ line  was only about \n19% of the expected breaking load  (52,700 kg ) and the\
  \ sample ro pe, which appeared to be in \nrelatively good condition , was only about\
  \ 40% of  the expected breaking load .    \n4.3.6.  There are a number of possible\
  \ reasons for the reported new sample rope suffer ing a significant \nreduction\
  \ in its strength.  Manufacturing inconsistencies , ultraviolet degradation,  heat\
  \ abrasion, \ndamage from previous usage  and exposure to water or chemicals  are\
  \ all possible reasons . \n4.3.7.  Neither the crew nor shore management were able\
  \ to determine with any  certainty  the origin of \nthe choker line  and the reported\
  \ ly new sample rope. They were also unable to determine \nwhether both the ropes\
  \ originated from the same coil.   There was no record of how long the \nchoker\
  \ line  had been in use or how long ropes should be used prior to retirement . \
  \ \nConsequently t he origin of the sample rope was not able to be traced . \n4.3.8.\
  \  If the choker line originated from the same coil from which the sample was taken,\
  \ it is very likely \nthat it starte d its life in service at about  40% of the\
  \ expected breaking load.  The onset of \nfatigue due to cyclic tension was therefore\
  \ very likely to ha ve been accelerated because the \nratio of the rope 's breaking\
  \ load to the normal service loads would have been signi ficantly \nlower.  \n \
  \                                                       \n23 This is a document\
  \ prepared by a vessel's  owner to set the standards and norms that should be used\
  \ to \ncreate a safe worki ng environment. The document is to be read in conjunction\
  \ with the vessel's Safe Ship \nManagement manual . \n  \n \nFinal report MO -2014\
  \ -203 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3.9.  Since the accident  the operator has started a\
  \ rope register to log ropes ' usage.  \nFindings  \n3. The rope management plan\
  \ on board the Captain M.  J. Souza  was not \neffectively managing the purchase\
  \ , storage, inspection and retirement from \nservice of the ropes on board.  \n\
  4. It is about  as likely as not that the choker rope that broke  on board the Captain\
  \ \nM. J.  Souza  began its life in service at a lower -than -typical breaking load\
  \ for a \nrope of that size and construction.  \n4.4. Ship safety m anagement  system\
  \  \n4.4.1.  At the time of the accident the Captain M. J.  Souza  was transitioning\
  \ its safety management \nfrom the now redundant SSM system to the new Maritime\
  \ Operator Safety System administered \nby Maritime New Zealand.  Under the SSM\
  \ code a ship's owner was required to engage a \nMaritime New Zealand -approved\
  \ organisation to administer its SSM system.  The Maritime \nOperator Safety System\
  \ was introduced on 1 July 2014, about two months prior to this \naccident.  On\
  \ 1 July 2014 any vessel with a valid SSM certificate received a 'deemed' Maritime\
  \ \nTransport Operator Certificate.  At the time of the accident  the Captain M.\
  \ J.  Souza  held a valid \ndeemed Maritime Transport Operator Certificate.  \n\
  4.4.2.  The Safe Ship Management documents  provided extensive guidance on the safe\
  \ working \npractic es expected on board the ship, including working with various\
  \ types of rope and twine \nand the breaking characteristics of synthetic ropes.\
  \  All crewmembers were required to ensure \nthat ropes were in good condition and\
  \ had strength appropriate to their appl ication s.  Ropes \nwere to be examined\
  \ for abrasions and  broken, deteriorated or displaced fibres.  \n4.4.3.  Maritime\
  \ rule Part 21 required an SSM organisation24 to carry out an external audit of\
  \ a ship \nprior to it gaining a n SSM certificate.  A subsequent external aud it\
  \ was required as part of the \nSSM certificate renewal process to ensure the vessel's\
  \ continued compliance with the \nrequirements of the  SSM code25.  In addition\
  \ to the external audit requirements,  the Captain M. \nJ. Souza  was internally\
  \ audited by the vessel 's shore  managers when it berthed in New Zealand \nor American\
  \ Samoa while discharging cargo.  \n4.4.4.  The operator said that internal audits\
  \ were conducted several times each year.  An internal \naudit would normally consist\
  \ of a 'walk around' the vessel and  the subsequent compilation of a \nwork list\
  \ in consultation with the master and crew. The work list was actioned at the vessel's\
  \ \nnext suitable port of call.  \n4.4.5.  An internal audit is a good tool for\
  \ measuring the effectiveness of safety management \nimplementation on board a ship.\
  \  However, to be effective an audit should be well documented, \ndeficiencies should\
  \ be clearly identified  and corrective action s agreed , and progress should be\
  \ \nmonitored until deficienc ies have been closed out.  \n4.4.6.  However, the\
  \ operator was unable to produce documents for the audits, such as findings and\
  \ \nany safety actions taken as a result of the audits.  Lack of audit documentation\
  \ had been  an \nobservation  made during the previous  SSM renewal audit in 2012\
  \ by the or ganisation \nresponsible for administering the vessel's S SM system.\
  \  \n4.4.7.  The Captain M. J.  Souza  was 35 years old at the time of the accident.\
  \ There is evidence to \nsuggest that the upkeep of the vessel was a matter of priority\
  \ for the owners.  For example, the \nSSM organisation was contracted by the owner\
  \ to inspect the vessel annually , even though the \nSSM code only required surveys\
  \ to be carried out twice in every five -year period.  \n                      \
  \                                  \n24 An organisation approved by Maritime New\
  \ Zealand to administer a vessel operator's SSM system.  \n25 An external SSM audit\
  \ does not include an inspectio n of ropes on board the vessel.  \n\n<< Page 16\
  \ >>\n Final report MO -2014 -203 4.4.8.  The Safe Working Practices document, which\
  \ was part of the ship's SSM system, was r egularly \nupdated and covered vessel\
  \ -specific activity.   The following extracts contained in the Safe \nWorking Practices\
  \ document are relevant to this accident . \nCrewmembers should be familiar with\
  \ the various types of ropes and twines and \ntheir special uses on board and in\
  \ particular with the breaking characteristics of \nsynthetic ropes .  \nCrewmembers\
  \ should always ensure that they use ropes only for the purpose for \nwhich they\
  \ are intended. Care should be taken that all ropes in use are in good \ncondition\
  \ and ha ve strength appropriate to their application.  \nRopes should be examined\
  \ frequently for abrasions and broken , deteriorated or \ndisplaced fibres or strand\
  \ and other defects.  \nA splice should be used where possible in place of a knot,\
  \ which weakens rope \nto a gr eater extent.  \nDuring the handling of mooring lines\
  \ or other wires or ropes, crewmembers \nshould take care not to stand in a bight26.\
  \ \nDuring the pursing operation, crewmembers should avoid standing in a position\
  \ \nwhere they will be endangered should a wire br eak out from a sheave or roller\
  \ \nfor any reason.  \n4.4.9.  However , contrary to the Safe Working Practices\
  \ document : \n\uF0B7 There were no documents on board to confirm the origin of\
  \ the choker line and sample \nrope, or how long these ropes had been on board .\
  \ \n\uF0B7 The reported new sample of rope removed from  the vessel was tested and\
  \ found to break \nat an average breaking load of 22 ,993 kg, less than half of\
  \ its expected breaking load of \nabout 52 ,752 kg . \n\uF0B7 The choker line  had\
  \ broken a few weeks previously while in  use.  The failed rope  was in \npoor condition\
  \ and should have been replaced , but instead  it was put back into service . \n\
  \uF0B7 The broken splice at the end of the rope was replaced with a bowline knot\
  \ . \n\uF0B7 The location on deck  where the crew routinely stood to th row dye\
  \ bombs into the water was  \nwithin the swinging radius of the  choker line, which\
  \ could come under sudden tension in \nthe event of the sling failing . \n4.4.10.\
  \  The operator's  Safe Work ing Practice s document covered five  topics that included\
  \ safety on \ndeck and saf ety in fishing operations.  It described purse seining\
  \ as a particularly dangerous \nmethod of fishing and outlined steps  to reduce\
  \ the risk of an accident. The document advised \ncrew to avoid standing in positions\
  \ where they would be endangered should a wire  break out \nfrom a sheave or roller,\
  \ and also to take care not to stand in the bight of a rope.  \n4.4.11.  However,\
  \  given the position  from which  the crew  were  required to stand and throw \
  \ dye bombs \ninto the water, this was practically unachievable ( see Figure 4)\
  \ . \n4.4.12.  The Captain M. J.  Souza  had procedures and instructions for carrying\
  \ out fishing operations \nsafely, which included not standing in the vicinity of\
  \ ropes.  However, the instruction was \ngeneric and did not discuss vessel -specific\
  \ risks , which in this case should  have included the \ninherent risks faced by\
  \ the person tasked with releasing dye bombs.  \n4.4.13.  Since the accident  the\
  \ operator of the vessel has mitigated the risk s by changing the location of \n\
  the choker line . In doing so it has  been moved  away from the position where crewmember\
  \ s \nwould be expected to stand when releas ing dye  bombs into the water.  \n\
  \                                                        \n26 A bight is the bent\
  \ part of a rope that forms a loop . \n  \n \nFinal report MO -2014 -203 \n<< Page\
  \ 17 >>\n Finding  \n5. The safety management system on board the Captain M. J.\
  \  Souza  provided \ngood guidelines for the management and use of ropes on board.\
  \  However, \nneither the crew  nor the  skipper nor shore management were  ensuring\
  \ that the \nsafety management system was being adequately followed.  \n  \n\n<<\
