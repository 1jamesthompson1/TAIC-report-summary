Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Fatigue and deterioration of ropes: The choker line and sling failed due to extreme cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion. The choker line had a significantly lower breaking strength than expected, and the sling failed due to the splice coming apart in service.

2. Lack of rope management plan: There was no formal recording or registering of ropes on board the vessel, and the inspection and requisition of ropes were delegated to the ship's bosun. There was a lack of guidelines on when to retire a rope from service, and no log or retirement standard documented in the safe ship management documents.

3. Inadequate safety management system: The safety management system provided good guidelines for the management and use of ropes, but neither the crew, skipper, nor shore management were ensuring that the system was being adequately followed. Lack of documentation for internal audits and deficiencies in audit documentation were observed.
