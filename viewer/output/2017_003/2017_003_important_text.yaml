  3.1. The right main landing gear did not lock down because the two locking springs\
  \ had \nfailed.  The failure of either one or both springs was very likely  to have\
  \ been  the cause of  \nthe unusual noises the cabin crew heard when the landing\
  \ gear was lowered on \napproach to Nelson.  \n3.2. The failure of the locking springs\
  \ to pull the over -centre lock into place meant that the \ntwo proximity position\
  \ switches detected the abnormal landing gear position. This \ndetection resulted\
  \ in t he circuit for the primary and secondary indication lights not being \nmade.\
  \  This was subsequently di splayed to the pilots on the instrument panels, alerting\
  \ \nthem to the unsafe condition of the right landing gear.   \n3.3. The failure\
  \ of both springs meant that the emergency checklist for an unsafe landing \ngear\
  \ indication was ineffective in correcting the fault.  The crew were  therefore\
  \ required  \nto conduct a landing at a suitable aerodrome with the possibility\
  \ that the landing gear \nwould  collapse on landing.  \n3.4. The following analysis\
  \ discuss es why the lock ing springs failed.  It also discuss es the \ncrew's actions\
  \ in diverting to Palmerston North , the checklists used by the pilots  and \nother\
  \ safety considerations .  \nLocking spring failures  \n3.5. The l anding gear locking\
  \ springs form ed part of the main landing gear assembly.  A \nsimilar  spring ,\
  \ but with a different part number,  was also installed on the nose landing \ngear.\
  \ The locking springs were confirmed by the manufacturer as having been \nmanufactured\
  \ in accordance with design specifications.   \n3.6. The cracking in each  spring\
  \  originated  on the inside of the coil facing the major axis o r \ncentre of the\
  \ spring.  The inside diameter of a spring was subject to greater stress than \n\
  the outside diameter.  When the landing gear was extended, the springs pass ed through\
  \ \nthe point of maximum tension and continue d to remain under tension in the down\
  \ a nd \nlocked position.  This tension result ed in the exten sion of the spring\
  \ s, which  exposed  the \ninside of the springs to the elements, where foreign\
  \ matter could  collect and where salts \ncould  concentrate.  The aeroplane was\
  \ operating in a corrosion environment  that was \nclassified as 'severe' according\
  \ to the Federal Aviation Administration's  Advisory Circular  \n43-4B (AC 43 -4B).\
  \ \n3.7. Metallurgy examinations of the locking springs found that both failed because\
  \ of \nintergranular corrosion followed by stress corrosion cracking and fatigue.\
  \ The springs \nfinally broke in overload.  The corrosion was likely initiated by\
  \ salt depositing on the \nsprings and over time reacting with the stainless steel.\
  \   \n3.8. AC 43 -4B outlines the different forms of corrosion. A summary of the\
  \ relevant forms is \nprovide d below:  \n1. Intergranular corrosion is a chemical\
  \ reaction  of oxidation on the grain boundaries \nof a metal. The metal consists\
  \ of quantities of tiny individual grains, and each grain \nhas a clearly defined\
  \ boundary that chemically differs from the metal within the \nFinal Report AO -2017\
  \ -003 \n<< Page 13 >>\n grain. The grain boundary and the grain centre  can react\
  \ with ea ch other as anode \nand cathode when in contact with an electrolyte (such\
  \ as salt).  \n2. Stress  corrosion cracking involves a constant or cyclic stress\
  \ acting in conjunction \nwith a damaging chemical environment.  \n3. Corrosion\
  \ fatigue involves the combination of cyc lic stress and corrosion and \noccurs\
  \ in two stages. First, corrosion and cyclic stress damage the metal by pitting\
  \ \nand crack formation. Next, the crack propagates, often spreading from corrosion\
  \ \npits. Fracture of a metal part by fatigue corrosion generally occurs at a stress\
  \ level \nfar below the fatigue limit in laboratory air.  \n3.9. Examining the requirements\
  \ for relevant forms of corrosion, it is evident that the cyclical \nstress of extending\
  \ and retracting the landing gear , combined with the corrosive \nenvironment in\
  \ which the aeroplane operated , increased the likelihood of corrosion \noccurring.\
  \  \nHistory of spring failures  \n3.10. The aeroplane manufacturer and the manufacturer\
  \ of the springs held records for a total \nof 19 locking spring failures. The aeroplane\
  \  manufacture r advised it had received 13 \nreports of landing gear locking springs\
  \ failing in service since 2005.  All 13 occurrences \nhad involved the failure\
  \ of a single spring, of which seven involv ed the main landing gear \nand six the\
  \ nose landi ng gear.  This occurrence, the 14 th, was the first dual in -service\
  \ \nfailure.  \n3.11. Six of the 13 failures had been  from a batch of incorrectly\
  \ manufactured locking \nsprings.27 Four had been  the result of \"mis-installation\
  \ of the nose landing gear locking \nspring link \". The springs from the remaining\
  \ t hree failures had not been recovered , so \nthe cause had not been identified.\
  \  There was no record of the flight cycles for any of the \nfailures.   \n3.12.\
  \ The aeroplane  manufacturer provided information from the manufacturer of the\
  \ landing \ngear locking spring , which showed that it had received  a further \
  \ six reports of spring \nfailure between 2006 and 2012.  Five of the six failures\
  \  had involved operators from the \nSouth East Asia region. Reports on three of\
  \ the six failures record ed \"corrosion pitting \" as \na cause.  A fourth stated\
  \ that \"oxidation was found near origin \". Laboratory test reports \nwere not\
  \ available for the remaining two failures.  Flight cycles before failure were \n\
  provided for four of the six reports, which showed that these springs had failed\
  \ after \ntheir first overhaul.   \nLanding gear  \nLanding gear  design  \n3.13.\
  \ The design of  the main landing gear meant that , with both springs in a failed\
  \ condition, a \nlarge sideways force when there was little or no weight (downwards\
  \ force) on the wheels \ncould have caused the landing gear to  collapse.  Once\
  \ the aeroplane had landed  and \nthere wa s full weight on the wheels , the landing\
  \ gear could not  collapse.  This explains \nwhy the right landing gear did not\
  \ collaps e on landing despite the two failed springs.  \n                     \
  \                                   \n27 Service Bulletin 631 -32-201, issued 19\
  \ May 2010, recommended the replacement of the subject \nlocking springs. The operator's\
  \ fleet of ATR72 aeroplanes did not include this batch of locking springs.  \n\n\
  << Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO -2017 -003 3.14. When designing the landing gear,\
  \ the manufacturer had conducted a system safety \nassessmen t to ensure an acceptable\
  \ level of safety existed. The system safety assessment \nhad examined the likelihood\
  \ of failures and the resulting consequences.  There were five \nconsequ ence ratings\
  \ : \n1. No Safety Effect : Failure Conditions that would have no effect on s afety;\
  \ for \nexample, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability\
  \ of the \naeroplane or increase crew workload.  \n2. Minor : Failure Conditions\
  \ which would not significantly reduce aeroplane safety, \nand which involve crew\
  \ actions that are well within their capabilities. Minor Failure \nConditions may\
  \ include, for example, a slight reduction in safety margins or \nfunctional capabilities,\
  \ a slight increase in crew workload, such as routine flight \nplan changes, or\
  \ some physical discomfort to pass engers or cabin crew.  \n3. Major : Failure Conditions\
  \ which would reduce the capability of the aeroplane or \nthe ability of the crew\
  \ to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that \nthere would be,\
  \ for example, a significant reduction in safety margin s or functional \ncapabilities,\
  \ a significant increase in crew workload or in conditions impairing crew \nefficiency,\
  \ or discomfort to the flight crew, or physical distress to passengers or \ncabin\
  \ crew, possibly including injuries.  \n4. Hazardous : Failure Conditions  which\
  \ would reduce the capability of the aeroplane \nor the ability of the crew to cope\
  \ with adverse operating conditions to the extent \nthat there would be:  \ni. a\
  \ large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities;  \nii. physical\
  \  distress or excessive workl oad such that the flight crew cannot be \nrelied\
  \ upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or  \niii. serious  or fatal\
  \ injury to a relatively small number of the occupants other \nthan the flight crew.\
  \  \n5. Catastrophic : Failure Conditions which would result in  multiple fatalities,\
  \ usually \nwith the loss of the aeroplane.  \n3.15. Four quant itative probability\
  \ ranges were further defined for determining the likelihood  \nof an event occurring:\
  \  \n1. Probable : those having an Average Probability Per Flight Hour greater than\
  \ of the  \norder of 1 x 10-5. \n2. Remote : those having an Average Probability\
  \ Per Flight Hour of the order of 1  x \n10-5 or less, but greater than of the order\
  \ of 1 x 10-7. \n3. Extremely Remote : those having an Average Probability Per Flight\
  \ Hour of the \norder of 1  x 10-7 or less, but greater than of the order of 1 x\
  \ 10-9. \n4. Extremely Improbable : those having an Average Probability Per Flight\
  \ Hour of the \norder of 1  x 10-9 or less.  \n3.16. The manufacturer's  assessment\
  \ of a (single) locking spring failure was that it would have \n'No Safety Effect\
  \ '. This was due to each landing gear having two locking springs, each \ncapab\
  \ le of locking the landing gear in the down position. The failure of one spring\
  \ did \nnot induce additional stress on the remaining spring. The manufacturer \
  \ further \nFinal Report AO -2017 -003 \n<< Page 15 >>\n determ ined that the consequences\
  \ of both springs failing would be 'Major '. 'Major ' \nfailure conditions are required\
  \ to be no more frequen t than 'Remote '.  \n3.17. This was the first double -spring\
  \ failure reported to the manufacturer. The international \naeroplane  fleet had\
  \ flown more than  30 million (3  x 107) flight hours at the time of the \nincident,\
  \ which was within the 'Extremely Remote ' probability range  for a double -spring\
  \ \nfailure to occur . Nevertheless, as locking springs remain in  service  in potentially\
  \ corr osive \nenvironments , it is important that appropriate maintenance and inspection\
  \ procedures \nare in place to ensure that double -spring failure s do not occur.\
  \  \nRoutine maintenance of the locking springs  \nSafety issue: The maintenance\
  \ inspection program me for the locking springs would have been \nunlikely to detect\
  \ the corrosion cracking in the locking springs prior to their failing , and that\
  \ there \nwas no required preventive maintenance on the locking springs to limit\
  \ the extent of corrosion \ndamage . \n3.18. ATR advi sed that there was not a \"\
  specific life limit for the springs as it is not a \nprimary structural element.\
  \  The parts having a life limit are the ones whose failure \nmay lead to the landing\
  \ gear collapse.  A single failure of one spring doesn't lead to \nthe land ing\
  \ gear collapsing \".28 As such, the springs were considered 'on condition' with\
  \ \nno life limit, provided they met the inspection and overhaul requirements while\
  \ in \nservice.  \n3.19. The locking springs were required to be checked at regular\
  \ intervals, either individ ually \nor as part of the landing gear assembly.  The\
  \ checks included a general visual check \nbefore each flight, a specific visual\
  \ check every 5,000 flight hours and an overhaul after \n20,000 cycles or nine years\
  \ , whichever occurred first . \nMaintenance records  \n3.20. Maintenance records\
  \ show ed that the right main landing gear and locking springs had \nbeen maintained\
  \ in accordance with the maintenance procedures. The locking springs \nhad also\
  \ met the physical load test requirements at their most recent  overhaul.  At the\
  \ \ntime of failure on 9 April 2017, the two springs had each accrued a total of\
  \ 36,366 flight \ncycles since new, 16,908 flight cycles since their last 20,000\
  \ cycle overhaul and 1,456 \nflight cycles since their last visual inspection. \
  \ \n3.21. At 36,366 flight cycles, the  failed locking springs were well above the\
  \ average for the \noperator's ATR fleet.29 However, the cycles  were still significantly\
  \ fewer  than the 42,000 \nflight cycles for the fleet leader.  The history of the\
  \ two aeroplanes on which  the right \nmain landing gear  and springs had been installed\
  \ was typical for the operator's fleet.   \nPre-flight check  \n3.22. It was not\
  \ possible to determine if one of the springs had failed before the incident \n\
  flight. The Flight Crew Operating Manual for the aeroplane  identified that the\
  \ landing \ngear structure was to be inspected as part of the exterior  pre-flight\
  \ inspection. The pilot \nconducting the pre -flight inspection had not identif\
  \ ied any problems with the landing \ngear.  \n3.23. The exterior inspection was\
  \ primarily a visu al check to ensure that the overall condition \nof the aeroplane\
  \ , the visible components and equipment were safe for the flight . This \n    \
  \                                                    \n28 Emphasis added.  \n29\
  \ The operator was in the process of upgrading the fleet to ATR72 -600 models. \
  \ \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2017 -003 inspection was almost certainly\
  \ not able to identify the corrosion cracks on the inner \ndiameter of the locking\
  \ springs befor e they failed.  \n3.24. However, a thorough inspection should be\
  \ able to detect a broken spring . There are \nlarge components surrounding the\
  \ main landing gear locking spring s, and these do \nmake it difficult to see the\
  \ entire le ngth of the spring from a single locati on. However, \nobserving the\
  \ springs from different locations  would have allowed for their complete \ninspection\
  \ , and almost certainly would have allowed for the detect ion of  an abnormal \n\
  condition (position or orientation) had one of them failed  (see Figure 7) . \n\
  Specific visual check  \n3.25. The specific visual check required a \"detailed \
  \ visual inspection of the MLG [main landing \ngear] locking springs to be sure\
  \ that they are not damaged or broken \". The specificity of \nthis check would\
  \ have  almost certainly ensured that any failed locking springs were \nidentified.\
  \ Therefore, both locking springs almost certainly failed after their last specific\
  \ \nvisual check. The investigation was unable to determine if the stress corrosion\
  \ cracks had \nbeen  present at the time of the last specific visual check.  \n\
  \ \nFigure 7: Main landing gear  \nOverhaul  \n3.26. The locking springs ' overhaul\
  \ procedures  required a physical load test, where each spring \nwas removed from\
  \ the landing gear assembly  and affixed to a test fixture. The test \ninvolved\
  \ extending the spring to a specific length and measuring the load required for\
  \ \nextension. If the load were  within the allowable range, and no  defect  or\
  \ damage were  \nidentified, the spring passed the load test. The ability of  this\
  \ method to identify  corrosion \ncracks in the spring was limited to the crack\
  \ reducing the force required to elongate the \nlooking forward  \n looking rearward\
  \  \nlocking springs  \nlocking springs  \nFinal Report AO -2017 -003 \n<< Page\
  \ 17 >>\n locking spring  or the spring f ailing. A visual in spection for corrosion\
  \ was also undertaken \nas part of this check .  \n3.27. The Quest metallurgic al\
  \ report identified that : \nThe position of the fatigue initiation around the spring\
  \ wire was primarily \ncontrolled by the location of highest torsional stress at\
  \ the sma llest radius in \nthe spring. The size of the initial area of SCC [stress\
  \ corrosion cracking] was \nonly 0.5mm in diameter. The implication is that only\
  \ small defects are \nrequired to initiate fatigue indicating that the springs are\
  \ not particularly \ndamage tole rant. In addition, surface SCC and cracking was\
  \ seen in sections \nfrom areas where they had been inspected by fluorescent dye\
  \ penetrant \ntesting and shown to be crack free i.e. dye penetrant testing was\
  \ not reliable \nto find the cracking seen. Taking all of t his into account it\
  \ is highly unlikely \nthat a suitable reliable inspection technique could be used\
  \ to prove the l ong \nterm safety of the springs.  \n3.28. Therefore, it is unlikely\
  \ that the stress corrosion  cracks that resulted in the failure of the \nlocking\
  \ springs  could  have been detected during any of the routine maintenance \ninspections.\
  \ Instead, the pre-flight  visual inspections to identify a failed locking spring\
  \ , \nand the redundancy of having two locking springs were the princip al mechanisms\
  \  in \nplace to avoid the double -spring failure that occurred on the accident\
  \ flight . \n3.29. It might appear coincidental that both springs failed at the\
  \ same time. However, as \nmentioned above, it could not be determined with any\
  \ certainty  whether one spring \nfailure preceded the second f ailure.  \n3.30.\
  \ Following this occurrence, the operator began a programme of replacing high -time\
  \ \nlocking springs.  Priority was given to springs that had accumulated more than\
  \  30,000 \nflight cycles.  The manufacturer of the aeroplane also began reviewing\
  \ the inspecti on \nprocedures for the locking springs to determine if an additional\
  \ inspection procedure \ncould  be implemented to identify corrosion and subsequent\
  \ cracking such as that which \nresulted in the failure of the locking springs.\
  \ See section 7 (safety actions ), for further \ninformation on the safety actions\
  \ taken.   \nAdditional  aircraft  maintenance  requirements  \n3.31. The ATR72\
  \  aeroplane  was subject to a ' Corrosion Prevention and Control Program me' \n\
  (CPCP ) managed by the manufacturer. The CPCP was in place for the entire life of\
  \ the \naeroplane , and was designed to limit the extent of corrosion damage to\
  \ the aeroplane  \nand its components. It placed additional requirements on the\
  \ maintenance of the \naeroplane  in the form of inspections, cleaning and protection.\
  \  The l ocking springs were \nnot specifically mentioned in the manufacturer's\
  \  documentation for the CPCP , as the \nlanding gear was not addressed by this\
  \ document .  \n3.32. The CPCP document included a 'corrosion severity map' of the\
  \ world , which matched \nthat contained in AC  43-4B. It categorised regions depending\
  \ on the potential for \ncorrosion to occur. There were three classifications that\
  \ dictated the period s between \npreventive maintenance actions. New Zealand was\
  \ categorised as a region with the \nhighest susceptibility  to corrosion, known\
  \ as a 'severe zone'.  This required the preventive \nmaint enance procedures to\
  \ be undertaken at the highest frequency.  \n3.33. The Quest metallurgic al report\
  \ identified that dirt and debris were  present on both \nsprings. This indicated\
  \ that they were unlikely to have been subject to any cleaning \nprocedure. Furthermore,\
  \ the Quest metallurgical report identified that cleaning the \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n\
  \ Final Report AO -2017 -003 springs would have likely reduce d the risk of salt\
  \ concentration on the  locking springs, \nwhich contributed to the corrosion. \
  \ \nOperational considerations  \nDiversion to  Palmerston North  \n3.34. The flight\
  \ crew elected to divert to Palmerston North rather than land at  Nelson or one\
  \ \nof the other possible aerodrome s in the general area - Woodbourne (Blenheim)\
  \ and \nWellington. The flight crew were more familiar with Palmerston North,  having\
  \ regularly \nflown there, including several days previously.  The geography of\
  \  Palmerston North  \nmeant that , should the landing gear collapse on landing\
  \ and the aeroplane depart the \nrunway, there was less risk of  the aeroplane \
  \ crashing into a n obstacle  than there was at  \nsome of the other available aerodromes.\
  \ With an available landing distance of 1 ,763 m, \nrunway 07 at Palmerston North\
  \ was longer than all the other runway s except one  of the \nWellington runways\
  \ . \n3.35. The rescue services available at Palmerston N orth, supported by local\
  \ emergency  \nservices, and the hospital being near by meant that there were sufficient\
  \ services available \nshould they be required . Finally, the crew had observed\
  \ the weather  conditions in the \nPalmerston North area as they flew south and\
  \ knew them  to be suitable.  To confirm this , \nthey obtained the latest weather\
  \ information , which confirmed the conditions to be clear  \nand near ly calm .\
  \ This ensured the crew were  able to focus on  flying the aeroplane and \ndid not\
  \ have to worry about  the wind or having to fly  an instrument approach  to get\
  \ \nbelow any cloud.  \n3.36. The diversion to Palmerston North was therefore considered\
  \ to have  been an \nappropriate choice.  \nChecklists  \nRecycling the landing\
  \ gear  \n3.37. Checklists are promulgated by the manufacturer and the operator\
  \ of an aeroplane to \nsupport the operating crew. This enables a crew to operate\
  \ as an effective team in a \nstandardised manner and  help prevent unintended consequences.\
  \ The checklist s are  \nbased on known or predicted conditions and are updated\
  \ as experiences and unforeseen \nevents occur. Pilots should, therefore, always\
  \ adhere to a checklist to ensure an \nappropriate response to a situation. Pilots\
  \ do , however, have a responsibility to ensur e \nthe safe conduct of flight s\
  \ and therefore have discretion to take any action they consider \nappropriate based\
  \ on their training, experience and knowledge of the situation.  When \ndoing so,\
  \ they should consider the potential consequences of any actions they take . \n\
  3.38. The aeroplane checklists stated that following a  confirmed  indication of\
  \ an unsafe \nlanding gear, pilots were directed to the 'landing gear gravity extension\
  \ ' checklist. If this \nwas unsuccessful, pilots were further directed to the 'landing\
  \ with abnormal landing \ngear' checklist.    \n3.39. In this occurrence , the flight\
  \  crew were  responding to a mechanical warning that the \nright main landing gear\
  \ had not locked down.  The flight crew, in attempting to lower the \nlanding gear\
  \ , recycled the landing gear, an action not included in the checklists for the\
  \ \naeroplane. Prior to this action, t he Nelson tower controller had said  that\
  \ there appeared \nto be nothing untoward.  This information was limited to the\
  \ observation that the wheels \nFinal Report AO -2017 -003 \n<< Page 19 >>\n appeared\
  \ to be down, but  the crew had no means of determining positively whether the \n\
  landing gear was fixed in place.   \n3.40. There was no evidence that the crew comprehensively\
  \ assessed the potential \nconsequences associated with recycling the landing gear\
  \ during their decision making  \nprocess . This assessment  would have likely identified\
  \ that the landing gear may have \nbecome stuck at an intermediate position. A comprehensive\
  \  assessment would  have  also \nlikely identified that external advice was available\
  \ , for example contacting the duty p ilot \nand lia ising with the operator's engineering\
  \ staff, which would have allowed further \nassessment of the possible ramifications.\
  \ There was ample fuel and time available to \nachieve this.  \n3.41. While the\
  \ flight crew 's actions to recycle the landing gear did not  affect the outcome\
  \ of \nthis occurrence, these actio ns were outside  the checklists contained in\
  \ the flight crew \noperating manual  procedures . In other failure cases,  recycling\
  \ might worsen the \nsituation.  The manufacturer confirmed this analysis and reiterate\
  \ d the need to follow the \nchecklists.  \nEngine shutdown  \n3.42. The 'landing\
  \ with abnormal landing gear' checklist directed that at touchdown both \nengines\
  \ were to be shut  down.  This action  result s in the loss of a number of services,\
  \ \nincluding  reverse thrust, nose wheel steering and normal brakes.  The loss\
  \ of these \nservices increase s the landing distance and has the potential to make\
  \ control of the \naeroplane on the ground more difficult.  The burst tyre on the\
  \ right side and the \nassociated skid mark suggest ed that  the captain had to\
  \ use heavy braking to prevent the \naeroplane leaving the left side of the runway.\
  \  \n3.43. The manufacturer advised that , in the event of a main landing gear collapse,\
  \ the \npropeller on that side would strike the ground  with unfavourable  results.\
  \  A gear collapse \nwould likely be sudden and give insufficient time for the crew\
  \ to react and the propeller \nto slow before striking the ground.  The checklist\
  \ was therefore predicated on the worst -\ncase scenario  and considered appropriate\
  \ .  \nOther considerations  \nCockpit voice recorder  \n3.44. To remove t he aeroplane\
  \ from the runway, the maintenance personnel reset all the \ncircuit breakers in\
  \ preparation for starting the engines.  These  included the circuit \nbreakers\
  \ for the CVR that had been pulled  out to protect the recording of the flight.\
  \  The \nCVR recorded in a two -hour loop.  By reapplying power to the aeroplane\
  \  with the CVR \ncircuit breakers reset , the CVR commenced recording again and\
  \ so overrode a portion of \nthe flight.  The loss of part of the record ing, while\
  \ not critical for the investigation of this \noccurrence, is a reminder of the\
  \ need to ensure  the protection of this potentially valuable \ninvestigation resource.\
  \   \nCommunications  \n3.45. The aeroplane was fitted with one interphone only\
  \ to enable the cabin crew to \ncommunicate with the pilots.  The interphone was\
  \ located by the rear cabin attendant's \nseat. This meant that the forward cabin\
  \ attendant was required to either move to the rear \nof the cabin to communicate\
  \ with the lead attendant, or rely on visual i ndicators for \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n\
  \ Final Report AO -2017 -003 information.  This may limit the ability of cabin \
  \ crew to pass on information  in a timely \nmanner . \n3.46. At the time of the\
  \ occurrence the operator was in the process of replacing the 500 -series \nof aeroplanes\
  \ with newer 600 -series.  The later version is equipped with two  cabin  \ninterphones\
  \ to allow direct and immediate communication between the two cabin  \nattendant\
  \ positions , and with the pilots.  The fleet replacement program me was expected\
  \ \nto be completed during 2020.   \n3.47. About two hours elapsed between th e\
  \ landing gear failing to lock down and  the \naeroplane  landing at Palmerston\
  \ North.  This gave ample time for the pilots to analyse  \nthe situation, obtain\
  \ external advice and prepare for the landing.  It also gave the cabin \ncrew time\
  \ to prepare the cabin.  This included individually briefing those passengers \n\
  seated by windows and exits, ensuring an unaccompanied minor was appropriately \n\
  managed and reassuring those in need.  This in turn ensured that everything was\
  \ calm \nand controlled during the landing and subseq uent disembarkation of the\
  \ aeroplane.   \n \n  \nFinal Report AO -2017 -003 \n<< Page 21 >>"
