- name: Corrosion and Material Failure
  explanation: Corrosion and material failure is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the locking springs of the landing gear failed due to intergranular corrosion followed by stress corrosion cracking and fatigue, which ultimately led to the springs breaking in overload. The corrosion was likely initiated by salt depositing on the springs and reacting with the stainless steel, exacerbated by the aircraft operating in a 'severe' corrosion environment ("The corrosion was likely initiated by salt depositing on the springs and over time reacting with the stainless steel" (3.7), "The aeroplane was operating in a corrosion environment that was classified as 'severe'" (3.6)).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Procedures
  explanation: Maintenance and inspection procedures are a safety theme in this accident as the routine maintenance inspection program for the locking springs was unlikely to detect the corrosion cracking prior to their failure. There was also no required preventive maintenance on the locking springs to limit the extent of corrosion damage. This indicates a potential gap in the maintenance program's ability to prevent such failures ("The maintenance inspection programme for the locking springs would have been unlikely to detect the corrosion cracking in the locking springs prior to their failing" (4.5), "there was no required preventive maintenance on the locking springs to limit the extent of corrosion damage" (4.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Design and Redundancy
  explanation: Design and redundancy are pertinent safety themes as the landing gear was designed with two locking springs, each capable of holding the gear in the down position. The failure of one spring did not induce additional stress on the remaining spring, which suggests that redundancy was a considered safety feature. However, this incident was the first dual in-service failure, indicating that the redundancy may not have been sufficient in preventing the unsafe condition ("The manufacturer's assessment of a (single) locking spring failure was that it would have 'No Safety Effect'" (3.16), "This occurrence, the 14th, was the first dual in-service failure" (3.10)).
- name: Environmental Operating Conditions
  explanation: Environmental operating conditions are a safety theme because the aircraft operated in an environment with a high potential for corrosion, which contributed to the failure of the locking springs. The Federal Aviation Administration's Advisory Circular classified the operating environment as 'severe', and the aircraft was subject to a Corrosion Prevention and Control Programme that did not specifically address the landing gear ("The aeroplane was operating in a corrosion environment that was classified as 'severe'" (3.6), "The CPCP was in place for the entire life of the aeroplane, and was designed to limit the extent of corrosion damage to the aeroplane and its components" (3.31)).
- name: Crew Decision-Making and Procedures
  explanation: Crew decision-making and adherence to procedures are safety themes because the flight crew's actions to recycle the landing gear multiple times before the emergency landing were outside documented procedures and had the potential to exacerbate the condition. This highlights the importance of following established procedures and the potential safety implications when deviations occur ("The recycling of the landing gear several times before the emergency landing was outside documented procedures, and had the potential to exacerbate the condition" (4.8), "Pilots should, therefore, always adhere to a checklist to ensure an appropriate response to a situation" (3.37)).
- name: Emergency Preparedness and Response
  explanation: Emergency preparedness and response is a safety theme as the crew's decision to divert to Palmerston North Aerodrome was sound, and the preparation for the emergency landing was well conducted in accordance with company procedures. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the crew's emergency response and the importance of having robust emergency procedures in place ("The crew's decision to divert to Palmerston North Aerodrome was sound and the preparation for the emergency landing was well conducted and in accordance with company procedures" (4.7)).
