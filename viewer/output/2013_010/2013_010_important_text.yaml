  \ in weather cond itions that fellow pilots said were \"perfect \".  The pilot \n\
  was familiar with the helicopter, the type of o peration and the general  area \
  \ where they landed .  \nThe accident was ver y unusual  in that it was preceded\
  \ by a near -collision during the prior go-\naround . \n4.1.2.  The pilot's injury\
  \ prevented his recalling the flight.  Therefore the evidence of the senior pilot\
  \ \nand the video taken by a passenger  were invaluable for the analysis .  The\
  \ senior pilot was \nseated on the right side of the parked helicopter and had a\
  \ clear  view of the helicopter during \nthe go -around, the last 30 m of the second\
  \ approach , and the collision.  \n4.1.3.  The analysis considers the following\
  \ possible causes of the collision : \na. the pilot might have misjudged the approaches\
  \ and separation  \nb. the pilot might have lost visual reference with the other\
  \ helicopter  \nc. the pilot might have lost control because : \n1) of a helicopter\
  \ defect  or \n2) a helicopter performance  limit was reached  \nd. the pilot might\
  \ have been affected by a medical or psychological condition . \n4.1.4.  In addition,\
  \ the fol lowing two safety issues identified during this inquiry are discussed:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 when pilots do not inform their flight -following organisation s of\
  \ changes to their route s or \ndestination s, any search and rescue action that\
  \ is required c ould be delayed or \nmisdirected  \n\uF0B7 the widespread practice\
  \ of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked \non snow while\
  \ the rotors are turning  is hazardous . \n4.2. The possibility of the pilot  misjudg\
  \ ing the separation  \n4.2.1.  The landing site that the pilot chose initially\
  \ was very likely where he  had landed that morning, \nbecause a passenger on that\
  \ flight said they had landed on a ridge, not a wide snowfield .  \nAlthough the\
  \ pilot had logged only one landing at the Tyndall Glacier, it was possible that\
  \ he \nhad made other landings there but had logged them as Lochnagar Saddle.  The\
  \ flight was a \nstandard snow experience flight, for which pilots had flexibility\
  \ as to where to land.  Landing on \nsuch an expansive snowfield , with another\
  \ helicopter as a focal point,  should not have  been \ndemandin g for one of the\
  \ operator's B -category pilots.   Given these circumstances, the lack of \na description\
  \ of the Lochnagar Saddle and Tyndall Glacier landing sites in the operator's \n\
  procedures at the time was almo st certainly not a factor in the accident.  \n4.2.2.\
  \  It wa s very unlikely that the pilot would have minded  the senior pilot taking\
  \ the lead prior to \narriving at the landing site.  It could not be determined\
  \ how often the pilot had followed \nanother helicopter to a snowfield landing.\
  \  The operator had not specified  a procedure for \nlanding multiple helicopters\
  \ at a single landing area , except that , for snow landings , all of the \nhelicopters\
  \ had to have landed before any passengers would be allowed to disembark.  There\
  \ \nwas no prescribed  minimum spacing between parked h elicopters.  The chief pilot\
  \ said the rule \nof thumb was one and a half rotor diameters between the rotor\
  \ discs29, and that rule \nappeared to have been generally followed .  As the main\
  \ rotor diameter of the AS350 Squirrel \nwas 10.7 m, th e rule would give nearl\
  \ y 27 m between the centres of adjacent landing sites.  \n4.2.3.  By comparison,\
  \ the recommended minimum distance between the centres of adjacent landing \nsites\
  \ at a heliport intended to serve Squirrel helicopters was 14.6 m (CAA, 2007). \
  \ The \nconcrete landing pads at t he operator's Queenstown base were a minimum\
  \ of 14 m apart.  \n                                                        \n29\
  \ A rotor disc is the area swept by a helicopter's  rotor blades each revolution.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO -2013 -010 Therefore the  pilot's normal\
  \ 'picture' of a  close,  adjacent helicopter was of one that was only \n14 m away,\
  \ on a clearly defined landing site.  He was sufficiently experienced in operations\
  \ \nonto u nmarked landing sites, such as  snowfields, and into confined areas that\
  \ it should have \nbeen second nature to ensure a safe separation.  \n4.2.4.  Having\
  \ another helicopter land first gives the following pilot a clear reference point\
  \ in an \notherwise unmarked landing area, and early warning of a blowing snow problem.\
  \  The se \nadvantages enable  the following  pilot to ensure a safe separation\
  \ from the one ahead . \n4.2.5.  There was plenty of space for the helicopter to\
  \ land to the right of the parked helicopter, \nwithout encroaching o n the steeper\
  \ upslope further to the right.  The parked helicopter was an \nexcellent visual\
  \ reference to assist the pilot in judging his rate of closure and spacing.  \n\
  4.2.6.  The initial alignment of the pilot's first approach appeared  well spaced,\
  \ but  the senior pi lot \nthought it was  too fast if the pilot intended to land\
  \ alongside his helicopter.  The senior pilot \nmight have interpreted the blowing\
  \ snow as a sign that the pilot had had to slow abruptly from  \na high speed. \
  \ However, other experienced  pilots of the ope rator considered the pilot's \n\
  approaches , as seen on the video, to be at an appropriate angle and speed.  \n\
  4.2.7.  A go-around is usually an undemanding manoeuvre in a helicopter , but the\
  \ pilot might have \nbeen annoyed with himself for having had to do so .  Whether\
  \ th is or the rebuke by the senior \npilot was a factor in the subsequent accident\
  \ was discussed with the Commission's consultant \npsychologist .30  In his opinion,\
  \ if  the pilot had been  in a negative frame of mind he could have \nhad a degraded\
  \ ability to focus on t he landing and simply misjudged the second approach.   \n\
  However, the chief pilot was of the opinion that it was in the pilot's nature to\
  \ have accepted \nthe rebuke and to have responded positively.  \n4.2.8.  There\
  \ were aspects of the pilot's performance during the go-around and the accident\
  \ itself \nthat were  similar to the misjudgement s reported  two months earlier\
  \  (see paragraph 3.4.9). \nThis is a strong indication that this accident  might\
  \ have been  the result of the pilot having \nmade  similar misjudgements , although\
  \ the pi lot could not recall any such events or having \nbeen reprimanded for such\
  \ a concern .  The reported errors in judgement  were serious and  the \noperator\
  \ ought to have had a written record of  them  and any remedial training that had\
  \ taken \nplace . \nFinding s \n1. The pilo t's training and the monitoring of his\
  \ performance  were in accordance \nwith the operator's training policy and procedures.\
  \  \n2. In the absence of any other explanation, the possibility that the pilot\
  \ had \nreverted to his previously reported behaviour and misjudge d his approach\
  \ \ncould not be excluded.  \n3. The operator's standard of  record keeping for\
  \ this pilot's training and \nperformance monitoring did not meet generally accepted\
  \ best practice . \n4. The weather and snow conditions were favourable  and t he\
  \ parked helicopter \nprovided an excellent visual reference for the pilot  to ensure\
  \ a safe \nseparation.  \n5. It could not be determined whether the senior pilot's\
  \ rebuke adversely \naffected the pilot's concentration or spatial judgement on\
  \ the following \napproach.  \n                                                \

  \ \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3. The possibility of a  loss of visual reference  \n4.3.1.\
  \  The operator's operations manual guided pilots in coping with ' bright -out'31,\
  \ blowing snow  and \na lack of spatial reference.  The manual  stated  that pilots\
  \ should make an initial approach and \nplan to go around unless conditions clea\
  \ rly allowed a landing. The manual further \nrecommended that:  \nIn conditions\
  \ of reduced surface visibility the pilot should not continue an \napproach without\
  \ visual reference to the snow surface unless reference can be \nachieved by the\
  \ presence of objects such as flags, rocks, helicopters\u2026  \nFirst approach\
  \  \n4.3.2.  The surface of the deep, powder snow was easily discerned.  The senior\
  \ pilot said that he had \nnot encounter ed blowing snow  when he landed , and none\
  \ could be  seen in the video.  His \napproach had been terminated w ithout an obvious\
  \ flare .32 \n4.3.3.  It was very likely that as the pilot of the following helicopter\
  \ was reducing his speed , the rotor \ndownwash lifted the surface snow.  The blowing\
  \ snow was not so dense as to obscure the \nparked helicopter, but it may have made\
  \ the rotor disc of the parked helicopter difficult  to \ndiscern.  \n4.3.4.  The\
  \ accident pilot watched the video five weeks after the accident and commented that\
  \ the \nblowing snow on the first approach appeared to be  \"not too bad\".  A photograph\
  \ taken by a \nrear-seat passenge r showed the parked helicopter more clearly than\
  \ the video did, and was \nvery likely  more representative of  what the pilot saw.33\
  \ \n4.3.5.  The operator's management  pilots considered  that the amount of blowing\
  \ snow raised on the \nfirst approach would have been easily within the pilot's\
  \ capabilit ies and experience to see \nthrough and land safely.  The fact that\
  \ he did not land was not especially significant, but it \nindicated that he made\
  \ a conscious decision to go around.   The senior pilot said that after the \npilot\
  \ began  the go -around the pilot had transmitted what sounded like \"too high\"\
  .  The audio \non the passenger video was analysed but the pilot's comments could\
  \ not be determined.  \n4.3.6.  A go-around from this position required a climb\
  \ straight ahead before making a left turn  away \nfrom the rising terrain.  The\
  \ pilot misjudged when he had passed  the parked helicopter and \ncould turn left\
  \ .  It was very likely that he  did not realise that he had  converg ed towards\
  \ the \nparked helicopter during the approach.  In addition, the blowing  snow may\
  \ have been dense \nenough that  he could not discern the edge of the parked helicopter's\
  \ rotor disc.  \nFinding  \n6. It was very likely that the pilot carried out the\
  \ go -around because he lost his \ndepth perception and sight of the other helicopter\
  \ in blowing  snow . \n \nSecond approach  \n4.3.7.  The passengers in the helicopter\
  \ said that the blowing snow at the end of  the second \napproach was worse  than\
  \ on the first approach , but the senior pilot di sagreed.  Although the \nvideo\
  \ stopped before the accident, the senior pilot watched  the approach of the helicopter,\
  \ \nwhich he said was similar in angle and speed to the first approach.  The senior\
  \ pilot saw the \n                                                        \n31 Bright\
  \ -out was descr ibed as \" a phenomenon caused by excessive reflection of sunlight\
  \ off the snow surface, \nresulting in a lack of depth perception, most common when\
  \ the sun is high in the sky and the snow is fresh \". (The \nHelicopter Line, Operations\
  \ Manual, section 5.26 , Snow landings affected by weather phenomena .) \n32 In\
  \ a flare the pilot applies aft cyclic, which produces a rearward rotor thrust component\
  \ that slows a helicopter.  \n33 Because the still photograph had a greater pixel\
  \ count than that of a standard video camera.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2013 -010 helicopter almost come abeam before it seemed  to turn  towards\
  \ him and a collision became  \nimminent.  \n4.3.8.  The attitude of the heli copter\
  \ at the point of collision could not be determined accurately \nwithout knowing\
  \ whether the main rotor disc of the parked helicopter was level.  However, it \n\
  was more likely than not  that the parked helicopter's disc was level , in readiness\
  \ for the \npass engers ' disembark ation .  If so, t he airborne helicopter was\
  \ in a more -or-less-level attitude \nat the time of the collision, as determined\
  \ by the angle at which its vertical stabiliser was \nsevered.  A level attitude\
  \ suggests  that the pilot was not flaring th e helicopter to reduce speed, \nor\
  \ accelerating for another go -around  or bank ing significantly to the left . \
  \ The landing skids, \nwhich are more than half a metre  below the lowest point\
  \ of the tail, were not hit by the rotor \ndisc, which indicat ed that the heli\
  \ copter did not directly overfly the parked helicopter.  \n4.3.9.  The environmental\
  \ conditions in this accident had some similarities to the accident on the \nRichardson\
  \ Glacier a few months later  (see paragraph 3.11.1) : the relatively high altitude;\
  \ \nclear and bright c onditions; fresh, flat snow; and blowing snow as the helicopter\
  \ was about to \nland.  However, i n the accident  near Mount Tyndall  the pilot\
  \ had the parked helicopter as a \nstrong visual re ference during both approaches.\
  \  \nFinding s  \n7. It was unlikely that blowing snow s ignificantly  affected\
  \ the pilot's view of \nthe parked helicopter during the second approach.  \n \n\
  4.4. The possibility of a loss of control  \n4.4.1.  The pilot's flying, judging\
  \ from the video, was smooth.  That, and the absence of any radio \ncommunication\
  \ from him to t he contrary, indicated strongly that the helicopter 's technical\
  \ \nperformance was normal.  No performance limitation was identified .  The passengers'\
  \ \nevidence did not indicate that the pilot was distracted or that anything interfered\
  \ with his \ncontrol during either approach.  \nHelicopter defect  \n4.4.2.  There\
  \ was nothing in the  passenger video , which began prior to the passengers boarding\
  \ at \nQueenstown,  to suggest that there was a technical problem or that the pilot\
  \ had difficulty at \nany stage with controlling the helico pter. \n4.4.3.  The\
  \ helicopter behaviour, in climbing and spinning after the tail rotor assembly separated,\
  \ was \nevidence of ample power being delivered to the transmission at the time\
  \ of the collision.  An \nexpert from Airbus Helicopters confirmed that the damage\
  \ to the main rotor system was \nstrong evidence that the rotor had been  under\
  \ high power when the helicopter struck the \nground.  For these reasons the engine\
  \ was not subjected to further examination.  \n4.4.4.  The flight controls moved\
  \ correctly , and continuity of the collective, cyclic and tail rotor \ncontrols\
  \  was shown as far as impact damage allowed.  The hydraulic system (which power\
  \ ed \nthe flight control servo actuators) had no obvious defects  and was not tested\
  \ further.  \nFinding  \n8. No technical defect was found that might have contributed\
  \ to the close go -\naround or to the collision.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2013 -010\
  \ \n<< Page 17 >>\n Performance limit  \n4.4.5.  Three of the key parameters that\
  \ affect an aircraft 's performance are:  \n\uF0B7 its total weight  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ altitude  \n\uF0B7 the air temperature.  \nThe location of the centre of gravity\
  \ primarily affe cts stability and controllability.  \n4.4.6.  The empty weight\
  \ of the helicopter was recorded in the helicopter logbook  as 1,327.7 kg .  The\
  \  \nfuel load on departure from Queenstown was 50% of tank capacity, or 213 kg.34\
  \  Using the \nassumptions of the operator's standard loading plan35, the take-off\
  \ weight of the helicopter \nwas later calculated to be 2,129 kg, which was under\
  \ the maximum permitted weight of 2,250 \nkg. \n4.4.7.  No-one calculated the weight\
  \ or the centre of gravity position before the flight, because one of \nthe operato\
  \ r's procedures waived the requirement when using a standard loading plan.  Had\
  \ \nthe weight and balance calculator been used, the pictorial display would have\
  \ indicated that \nthe centre of gravity was ahead of the forward limit.  \n4.4.8.\
  \  The passengers were not weighe d before the flight or after the accident.  However,\
  \ they were \nobserved to be lightly framed and generally of short stature.  Therefore,\
  \ their average weight \nwas very likely to have been less than the operator's standard\
  \ weight of 80 kg.   Using \nhypothetica l passenger weights of up to 75 kg, t he\
  \ take -off weight was re -estimated  as 2,079 \nkg, with the centre of gravity\
  \ on the forward limit.  Allowing for fuel used during the flight , the \nweight\
  \ at the time of the accident was estimated to have been  2,037 kg, with the centre\
  \ of \ngravity then behind the forward limit ( and therefore within limits ) (see\
  \ Appendix 1).  \n4.4.9.  According to the flight manual, at a landing weight of\
  \ 2 ,037 kg and with an air temperature of \nplus five degrees Celsius , the helicopter\
  \ could have hover ed out of ground effect36 at a \npressure altitude of 2 ,700\
  \ m, which was about 650 m above the accident site.   This hover \ncapability showed\
  \ that there would have been  adequate power and control for the normal \nmanoeuvres\
  \ associated with landing and take -off at  the lower altitude of the accident site.\
  \  \n4.4.10.  Although the helicopter weight and centre of gravity position were\
  \ likely to have been within \nlimits for this flight, the operator's procedures\
  \ risked pilots taking off with their helicopter s \noutside permissible li mits.\
  \ For example, if six passengers of standard weight were carried with \na standard\
  \ 60% fuel load and a pilot weighing 95 kg, the centre of gravity would remain \
  \ ahead \nof the forward limit, even with the maximum possible ballast carried in\
  \ the rear of the \nhelicopter.   If pilots checked the weight and balance calculator\
  \ for every flight, they would be \nalerted  to the actual balance condition.  \n\
  4.4.11.  Therefore, the operator's standard loading plans did not guarantee that\
  \ the weight and centre \nof gravity position woul d be within permissible limits.\
  \  As the operator's procedures waived a \ncalculation of weight and balance when\
  \ a standard loading plan was used, and did not require \npilots to verify weight\
  \ and balance if a standard loading plan was used, it was very likely that \npotential\
  \ loading errors could go undetected.  \n4.4.12.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft\
  \ is required37 to assess the weight and balance information \nand to ensure that\
  \ the aircraft will remain for the duration of the flight within the limits \n \
  \                                                       \n34 The fuel quantity indicator\
  \ scale showed intervals of 10%.  Fuel weights are for a specific gravity of 0.79.\
  \  \n35 Except 75 kg was used for each front -seat passenger  in order to comply\
  \ with t he seat weight limit.  \n36 A helicopter is 'in ground effect' when the\
  \ d ownwash from the main rotor  strikes the surface and generates an \nincrease\
  \ in pressure, which effectively creates a cushion of air that reduces the power\
  \ required to hover.  The \neffect reduces as the helicopter moves away from the\
  \ surface, with the result t hat more power will be required.  At \na height equivalent\
  \ to approximately half of the rotor diameter, the effect is considered to be nil\
  \ and the helicopter \nis then 'out of ground effect '. \n37 Civil Aviation Rule\
  \ 135.305 (b).  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO -2013 -010 specified in the\
  \ f light manual.  The procedures used by the operator in 2013 meant that its \n\
  pilots often did not assess this information, and instead relied on the implied\
  \ guarantee that \nthe standard loading plans would keep them within the limits\
  \ . \n4.4.13.  The CAA, in allowing the use of standard passenger weights, emphasised\
  \ that flight manual \nlimitations must be observed.38  The operator has since amended\
  \ its procedures to require an \nactual weight and balance calculation for every\
  \ flight.  \n4.4.14.  Experience with the Squirrel helicopter had  shown  that care\
  \ was needed to ensure that the \ncentre of gravity was not ahead of the forward\
  \ limit when a dual seat was fitted  and six \npassengers were  carried.39  On 27\
  \ November 2015, in an action  unrelated to this accident, \nthe CAA issued an airworthiness\
  \  directive40 that required the actual weight and balance to be \ncalculated before\
  \ every flight of a Squirrel helicopter when people or cargo occupied the two -\n\
  place front seat.41 \nFinding s \n9. The helicopter's weight and centre of gravity\
  \ position were estimated to  \nhave been within flight manual limits at the time\
  \ of the accident.  \n10. The operator's procedures regarding the use of standard\
  \ load ing plans did \nnot ensure compliance with the Civil Aviation Rule that on\
  \ all occasions \nhelicopters are to be  flown within the li mitations published\
  \ in the flight  \nmanual .  In this case the use of the standard load ing plan\
  \ did not cause or \ncontribute to the accident.  \n \n4.5. The possibility of a\
  \ medical or psychological condition  \n4.5.1.  There was no obvious explanation\
  \ for an experienced pilot, performing  a routine and familiar \nflight  in a serviceable\
  \ helicopter under ideal weather conditions , having a serious collision risk \n\
  twice in a short space of time.  The possibility that t he pilot  misjudg ed the\
  \ separation between \nthe helicopters because  of a medical or psychological condition\
  \  was considered . \nMedical condition  \n4.5.2.  The medical notes held by the\
  \ CAA and the pilot's general practitioner contained nothing t o \nsuggest that\
  \ a pre-existing medical condition could have been a factor .  His use of h ay fever\
  \  \nmedication was considered not pertinent, and tests for illicit drugs and alcohol\
  \ were negative.  \n4.5.3.  A passenger on the morning snow landing flight to the\
  \ Lochnagar Saddle area said that they \nthought the pilot had been  \"good, safe\
  \ and secure , and aware of ever ything \".  A passenger o n \nthe later Milford\
  \ Sound flight  knew the pilot  and said his demeanour had been  \"okay \", with\
  \ \nnothing unusual  noted .  None of the passengers on the accident flight, and\
  \ no ne of the staff \nwho saw the pilot during the day, said they had  noticed\
  \ anything of concern about the pilot . \n4.5.4.  Before departing Queenstown on\
  \ the accident flight , the pilot was wearing a cap with \nsunglasses resting above\
  \ the peak.  It is not known whether he was wearing the sunglasses at \nthe time\
  \ of the accident.  Durin g the approaches to the Tyndall Glacier, the sun w ould\
  \ have \nbeen ahead and a bove , and slightly to the left .  Without  sunglasses,\
  \ glare from the bright snow \n                                                \

  \ , collision with terrain , near Fox \nGlacier, 29 October 1994.  \n40 An airworthiness\
  \ directive is a mandatory instruction, issued by the CAA, to ensure the continued\
  \ a irworthiness \nof an aircraft or component . \n41 Airworthiness Directive DCA/AS350/128\
  \ Forward two -place seat - Operating limitations.   Where weighing \npassengers\

  \ permissible to use e ach \npassenger's declared weight plus 6 kg. \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2013 -010 \n<< Page 19 >>\n could  have been a problem .  However, t he parked\
  \ helicopter  would have provided  a good \ncontrast with the snow . \n4.5.5.  The\
  \ pilot's  vision had been checked at a routine CAA medical examination less than\
  \ two \nmonths previously .  The requirement that he have half -spectacles available\
  \ was a common \nage-related requirement, primarily for reading charts and manuals,\
  \ and not pertinent to this \nflight.  Therefore  it was  unlikely that he had a\
  \ vision problem  at the time of the accident . \n4.5.6.  The accident pilot did\
  \ not advise the senior pilot that he was unwell or having  any difficulty  \nflying\
  \ the helicopter .  During  the go -around, the pilot was reported to have said\
  \ only  that he \nhad misjudged his approach angle ; that he was too high .  He\
  \ did not respond to the senior \npilot's rebuk e for coming too close .  Had the\
  \ pilot been affected by a medical condition t hat \nprevented him making a radio\
  \ call, it would have been very unlikely that he could have mad e a \nsteady  approach\
  \ to land . \n4.5.7.  The video did not show the last 10 seconds or so before the\
  \ collision, but what was recorded \nsuggest ed that the pilot was in full control\
  \ of the helicopter  on both approaches.   Some \npassengers s aid it was \"windy\
  \ \" or that the helicopter was \"rocky \" or \"swaying \" on the second  \napproach\
  \ , but the senior pilot said it was not windy.  The passengers may have mistaken\
  \ \nblowing snow - and possibly the normal vibration that is felt when  a helicopter\
  \ slows down - \nas an indication of wind.  \n4.5.8.  If the passengers' recall\
  \ of events was not confused by the collision, their description of a \n\"rocky\
  \ \" or \"swaying \" approach could have meant the pilot was over-controlling. \
  \  However, the \nsenior pilot observed the impending and actual collision and did\
  \ not see any evidence of over-\ncontrolling . \n4.5.9.  Some neurological disturbances,\
  \ such as a severe migraine or  a transient ischaemic attack \n('mini -stroke'),\
  \ can cause impairment or be ongoing risks of incapacitation (CAA, 2010).  It can\
  \ \nbe difficult to prove that such an event ha s occurred , because the re might\
  \ not be any  \n'artefact', or physical evidence.   However, i n the opinion of\
  \ t he pilot's rehabilitation medical \nconsultant , apart from the traumatic h\
  \ ead injury , \"there was no discrepancy in his \npresentation to suggest that\
  \ there was any other medical/neurological diagnosis that had \noccurred around\
  \ the time of the crash \". \nFinding  \n11. There was no evidence to suggest  that\
  \ the pilot had a medical condition  \nthat contributed to the accident , but that\
  \ possibility cannot be excluded.  \nPotential psychological condition  \n4.5.10.\
  \  Having been unable to identif y any direct caus e of the accident, the Commission\
  \ co nsidered \nthe possibility of an obscure p sychologic al factor.  \n4.5.11.\
  \  The i nvestigation considered  whether the pilot might have tried so hard to\
  \ stay clear of the \nparked helicopter  on the second approach that he  experienced\
  \ an 'ironic process  of mental \ncontrol '.  The theory of this psychological effect\
  \ , which might  cause  a person  to do exactly \nwhat they were trying to avoid,\
  \ is summarised  in Appendix  2.  An example that illustrates the \ntheory is a\
  \ cyclist  hitting an obstruction that they were trying strenuously to avoid . \n\
  4.5.12.  The possible relevance of the theory  is as follows.  The pilot would have\
  \ been aware that the \ngo-around was delaying the snow experience for both groups\
  \ of passengers.  One would \nexpect him to have want ed to complete the go -around\
  \ quickly  and to make a tidy landing near \nthe parked helicopter.  If he had been\
  \ overly  intent on making a 'perfect' landing  close  to the \nother helicopter,\
  \ he might have tried too hard to avoid getting  too close and, ironically , flown\
  \ \ninto it. \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report AO -2013 -010 4.5.13.  However, t\
  \ he circumstances did not fit the theory well.  Ironic effects require some a dverse\
  \ \nmental  load.  The go -around might have created some time pressure and the\
  \ pilot may ha ve \nfelt driven to make a better  approach, but those pressures\
  \ were unlikely to have been of \nsufficient intensity or duration t o provoke an\
  \ ironic effect.  \n4.5.14.  A further  reason to do ubt the applicability of th\
  \ is theory comes from Wegner's view on the role \nof 'automaticity ' in resisting\
  \ ironic effects  (Wegner, 1994, p.48) .  Even an experienced pilot \nmust give\
  \ close attention to the desired touchdown point and prevailing conditions, but\
  \  the \nmanipulation of the controls to achieve the landing is essentially an automatic\
  \ skill.  The pilot \nwas very familiar with landing in confined areas and on landing\
  \ sites with the minimum \nseparation from adjacent sites  (for example, at the\
  \ operator's bas e).  It was very unlikely  that \nhe would have been trying 'too\
  \ hard' to land close to the parked helicopter  when the parked \nhelicopter provided\
  \ a highly visible point of reference and there was ample space . \n4.6. Summary\
  \  of potential causes  \n4.6.1.  The analysis considere d the following potential\
  \ causes of the collision:  \na. misjudge ment by the pilot of his separation  from\
  \ the parked helicopter  \nb. loss of  visual reference with the other helicopter\
  \  \nc. loss of control because  of a helicopter defect or  because a  performance\
  \  limit was \nreached  \nd.  the pilot being affected by a medical or psychological\
  \ condition . \n4.6.2.  The pilot w as experienced in flying onto unmarked landing\
  \ sites, such as snowfields, and into \nconfined areas such that it should have\
  \ been second nature for him to ensure a safe \nsepa ration.  The landing site was\
  \ expansive  and the p arked helicopter was an excellent visual \nreference .  The\
  \ pilot clearly misjudged his spacing twice , but only the first instance c ould\
  \ be  \nexplained.  \n4.6.3.  The first helicopter landed  without raising any blowing\
  \ sno w, which might have misled the pilot \ninto not reducing his speed sufficiently\
  \ early on his first approach .  When the pilot did go \naround  because of the\
  \ blowing snow his helicopter raised, he did not discern the parked \nhelicopter's\
  \ rotor disc and turned too  soon, passing close in front of it. \n4.6.4.  No evidence\
  \ was found of a mechanical problem with the helicopter, or of its pe rformance\
  \ \nbeing  adversely affected .  No medical reason was identified to explain the\
  \  pilot's actions .  An \nobscure psychological effect was c onsidered unlikely\
  \ to have been a contributing factor . \n4.6.5.  The fact that within three months\
  \ the operator had two accidents during snow landings did not \nnecessarily indicate\
  \ that the operator's standards or training were inadequate.  Snow landings \nare\
  \ inherent ly hazardous and the operator 's pilots were trained to anticipate blowing\
  \ snow \nand to perform go-around s if they los t essential visual references. \
  \ The nature of helicopter \noperations mean s that they routinely operate close\
  \ to other aircraft and structures .  Therefore \nit is reasonable to assume that\
  \ pilots will normally maintain  a safe separation from other \nhelicopters and\
  \ structures throughout every approach and landi ng. \nFinding  \n12. The cause\
  \ of the collision was not determined.  \n \n \nFinal Report AO -2013 -010 \n<<\
  \ Page 21 >>\n 5. Safety issues  \n5.1. The following  safety issues were identified\
  \ during this inquiry:  \n\uF0B7 when pilots do  not inform their flight -following\
  \ organisation s of changes to their route s \nor destination s, any search and\
  \ rescue action that is required c ould be delayed or \nmisdirected  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter\
  \ \nparked on snow while the rotors are turning is hazardous.  \n Flight -following\
  \  \n5.2. The failure of an ELT on a crashed aircraft to transmit a signal, or for\
  \ the signal to be not \nheard, can have potent ially fatal consequences .  If the\
  \ alarm  is not raised some other way , \nwhich fortunately did happen in this case,\
  \ search and rescue action will not begin until the \noperator determine s that\
  \ the flight is overdue.  \n5.3. Therefore  it is imperative that a flight -following\
  \ system ha ve accurate information regarding \nthe route, destination and intended\
  \ actions of a flight  being monitored .  An unannounced \nchange to the information\
  \ that was last advised could result in a search  of the wrong  area.   In \nthis\
  \ case the pilot ra dioed the operator's base that the two helicopters were about\
  \ to land at \nthe Lochnagar Saddle, but the actual landing took place about three\
  \  kilometres away.   The \nCommission has highlighted this as a key lesson arising\
  \ from this investigation.  \n5.4. The poor rel iability of ELTs is a global issue.\
  \   However, t he varied circumstances of aircraft \ncrashes mean that 100% reliability\
  \ might never be achieved.  Severe damage, fire or an \nobstructed or broken antenna\
  \ are common reasons for signals not being received  after a  \ncrash . \n5.5. Apart\
  \ from manufacturers improving the reliability of their ELTs , operators could reduce\
  \ the \nconsequences of un-alerted accident s in remote site s by fitting GPS flight\
  \ tracking device s.  \nTracking devices have prove d their worth time and again\
  \  when ELTs have failed .  At the time, \nthe operator had flight trackers  fitted\
  \ to some of its helicopters , but ne ither of the helicopters \ninvolved in  this\
  \ accident had one fitted.42 \n5.6. The Commission drew attention to the benefits\
  \ of flight tracking devices and the poor \nreliab ility of ELTs when it r ecommend\
  \ ed to the Director of Civil Aviation  on 26 February 2014 \nthat he43: \n\uF0B7\
  \ encourage the use of flight tracking devices, especially for use in aircraft operating\
  \ in \nremote areas around New Zealand (005/14)  \n\uF0B7 continue to suppo rt the\
  \ international work underway to improve the crash survivability \nof ELTs and to\
  \ include GPS information in the data transmitted by such devices \n(006/14).  \n\
  On 5 March 2014 the CAA replied, in part:  \n\uF0B7 (005/14) In our draft recommendation\
  \ response 31 Januar y 2014, the Director \ncommented that the CAA provide for the\
  \ fitment of Flight Tracking Devices (FTDs) by \noperators and this can be achieved\
  \ in accordance with the relevant provisions of AC 43 -\n14.  The CAA will continue\
  \ to encourage operators to fit FTDs in  this manner. The CAA \nconsiders the action\
  \ sufficient to satisfy the closure of the Commission's \nrecommendation  \n\uF0B7\
  \ (006/14) In the same response letter, the Director commented that the CAA already\
  \ \nsupports in principle the ICAO [International Civil Aviation O rganization]\
  \ and \n                                                        \n42 Since April\
  \ 2014 the operator had installed flight tracking device s in all of its helicopters\
  \ , and all of its operating \nbases had dedicated monitoring screen s. \n43 Inquiry\

  \ efforts to improve the crash survivability of ELTs and accuracy of \nposition\
  \ reporting. The work is ongoing and in this context the CAA requests that the \n\
  recommendation be closed.  \n5.7. Both safety recommendations remain open.  The\
  \ Commission has also promoted the benefits \nof flight tracking devices in its\
  \  Watch List  item: Technologies to track and locate .44 \n Disembarking while\
  \ rotors are turning  \n5.8. Although not a factor in this accident, a further safety\
  \ issue identified during the inq uiry was \nthe widespread practice of allowing\
  \ passengers to leave and return to helicopter s parked on \nsnow while the rotors\
  \ are turning.  Frequently the pilot will also disembark to guide the \npassengers\
  \ while they move under the main rotor disc.  There is a  serious risk to people\
  \ on \nthe ground if  a helicopter has settled into fresh snow or it breaks through\
  \ an apparently hard \nsurface crust .  Should this happen  the clearance between\
  \ the rotor disc and people walking \nbeneath could reduce sufficiently for someo\
  \ ne to be struck by the rotor blades . \n5.9. The risk persist ed in spite of \
  \ the operator , in common with other operators, having taken steps \nto reduce\
  \ it by fitting snowshoes to helicopter landing skids and by training pilots in\
  \ the correct \nsnow landing technique s. \n5.10.  The Director of Civil Aviation\
  \ informed the Commission of  proposed  Civil Aviation Rules t hat, if \npassed,\
  \ could  address  the hazard of leaving helicopters unattended w ith the rotors\
  \ t urning \nunder power.45  However, there is no certainty that the proposed ru\
  \ les will be implemented . \n5.11.  Therefore , the Commission recommend ed that\
  \ the Director of Civil Aviation ensure that  \nhelicopter operators that conduct\
  \ snow landings  address in their safety management systems \nthe hazard of passenger\
  \ disembarkation and embarkation  during those  landings while the \nrotors are\
  \ turning.  \n \n                                                        \n44 See\
