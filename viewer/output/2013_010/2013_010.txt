The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry  and 
an independent Crown entity .  It is  responsible for inquirin g into maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of  the occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The C ommission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 28 October 2013 a party of 12 tourists was taken in two AS350 Squirrel helicopters 
operated b y The Helicopter Line from Queenstown aerodrome to a snowfield  approximately two 
kilometres southeast of Mount Tyndall in Otago province.  The first helicopter landed .  The 
second helicopter  was about to land  but the pilot carried out a go -around .  During  the go-around 
the helicopter came close to colliding with the main rotors of the parked helicopte r. 
1.2. On the second approach  the helicopter drifted towards the parked helicopter  and its tail 
contacted the main rotor blades  of the parked helicopter.  Th e blad es severed the lower vertical 
stabiliser and part of the tail rotor of the airborne helicopter .  The rest of the tail rotor assembly 
and vertical stabiliser detach ed immediately . 
1.3. The helicopter was uncontrollable w ithout the tail rotor assembly .  It spun r apidly a number of 
times before climbing slightly  then  crash ing about 70 metres in front of the parked helicopter .  
The pilot received a serious injury and all of his passengers received minor injuries.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Com mission)  found that  blowing snow very 
likely contribut ed to the near collision during the go -around , but it was unable to determine the 
cause of the collision.  The Commission made findings  that excluded technical, helicopter 
performance and other environm ental factors as causes of the collision .  The possibility that the 
pilot misjudged his approach , causing the accident , could not be excluded .  There was no 
evidence to suggest that the pilot  had a medical condition that contributed to the accident, but 
that possibility c ould not be excluded . 
1.5. The Commission identified the following  safety issue s during the inquiry:  
 when pilots  do not inform their flight -following organisation s of change s to their route s or 
destination s, any search and rescue action that is required c ould be delayed or 
misdirected  
 the widespread pr actice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked 
on snow while the rotors are turning  is hazardous . 
1.6. A recommendation  was made to the Director of Civil Aviation that he ensure  that helicopter 
operators who conduct snow landings  address in their safety management systems the hazard 
of passenger disembarkation  and embarkation  during snow landings while the rotors are 
turning.  
1.7. The key lessons  identified during the inquiry into thi s occurrence were:  
 transport operators should  keep  formal records of concerns about operational staff and 
how they are dealt with.  Record  keeping is consistent with the safety management 
system goal of improving system quality  
 pilots should ensure  that they inform  their flight -following  organisation s of any change s to 
their operating area s or destination s.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At 1630 on 28 October 2013 t he Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) informed the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission (Commiss ion) of the accident.  The Commission opened an inquiry 
that day . 
2.2. Before  the Commission's investigators arrived on site  early in the afternoon of 29 October 
2013 , the Commission gave permission for both helicopter s to be de-fuelled and for the cabin 
of the  parked helicopter t o be stripped in preparation for  removal from the site.   Investigators 
examined bo th helicopters briefly on site , ahead of a  forecast  deterioration in the weather.  The  
helicopters  were lifted by helicopter to Wanaka  later that day.  
2.3. Both helicopters were examined at Wanaka before the helicopter  that had been parked during 
the collision  was returned to the operator.   The landing helicopter, ZK -IMJ, was t aken  to the 
Commission's technical facility in Wellington .2 
2.4. Between 29 October and 1 N ovember 2013 investigators interviewed t he operations manager 
and chief pilot of The Helicopter Line Limited ( the operator) , the pilot of the parked helicopter, 
and the passengers who had been  in ZK -IMJ.  Other witnesses were intervie wed by phone in 
Novemb er 2013.  
2.5. The pilot of ZK -IMJ was not fit to be interviewed until 4 December 2013.   Owing  to the nature of 
his injury, t he interview was conducted in the presence of a medical rehabilitation specialist.   
The Commission's medical consultant reviewed the pilot's medical records made before and 
after the accident.  
2.6. On 4 September 2014 the investigator in charge  re-interviewed the operations manager and  the 
chief pilot. 
2.7. The documented policies and procedures  of the operator , the training records it held for the 
pilot and the maintenance records for the helicopter were reviewed during the investigation.  
2.8. There were no fatalities among the passengers, all of whom were from the People's Republic of 
China.  New Zealand was not obliged by Annex 13 , Aircraft Accident and  Incident Investigation,  
to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to notify China of the accident.  However, the 
New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and a Chinese consular official were 
informed of the accident and investigation.   
2.9. France, the State of Manufacture of the helicopter and the engine , did not formally participate 
in the initial investigation , but an expert from the manufacturer  assist ed with a further review of 
the wreckage on 27 January 201 6. 
2.10.  On 14 December 2016 the Commi ssion approved a draft report for circulation to  interested 
persons  for comment .  Written s ubmissions were received from three interested persons.   The 
Commission considered the submissions and in May 2017 circulated an amended draft report 
to two interest ed persons for comment . 
2.11.  Written submissions on the amended draft report were received from both interested persons.  
The Commission considered the submissions , and changes made as a result of those 
submissions have been included in the final report . 
2.12.  On 28 June 2017  the Commission approved the final report for publication .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Monday 28 October 2013 a Squirrel helicopter registered ZK -IMJ (the helicopter) was 
assigned to the pilot who had the accident  later that day  (the pilot) .  At 0910 h e departed on hi s 
first flight of the day, taking six passengers from the operator's main base at Queenstown 
aerodrome for a 'snow landing experience' in mountains to the north.3  The flight returned to 
Queenstown at 1012.  
3.1.2.  At 1036 the pilot carried out  a passenger flight to Milford Sound , where the helicopter was shut 
down for two hours.  While at Milford Sound the pilot had a light lunch.  On the return flight they 
landed briefly in deep , fresh  snow near  the Humboldt Glacier , before arriving at  Queenstown at 
1413.  
3.1.3.  At 144 8 the pilot departed Queenstown  in company with another Squirrel4 to take a tour group  
for a scenic flight and snow landing  in the Lochnagar Saddle area, south of  Mount Tyndall.  Each 
helicopter had  six passengers .  The pilot  led the way .  At 1504 he radioed the Queenstown base 
to say they were landing at Lochnagar Saddle .  However, the more experienced pilot (the senior 
pilot) of the second helicopter radioed  that the snow looked better further north .  The senior 
pilot then took the lead and flew to the expansive snowfield above Snowy Creek, also referred to 
as the Tyndall Glacier.  
3.1.4.  The senior  pilot said he made a shallow approach  because  he was alert to the possibility of a 
slight tailwind and of the main rotor downwash causing 'blowing snow '.5  A video taken by a 
front -seat passenger in the helicopter that later crashed (ZK-IMJ) (the video)  showed that  the 
lead helicopter came to a hover  before landing , with no discernible blowing s now.  The senior 
pilot said the wind appeared to be calm.  
3.1.5.  The pilot of ZK -IMJ made an approach to the right of the parked helicopter .  The video  showed 
that initially there was adequate lateral s eparation from the parked helicopter .  None of the 
passengers spoke English as a first language, but one said that the pilot was talking to them 
over the intercom as they approached to land , and that his voice was steady and did not 
suggest that he had any  concern s. 
3.1.6.  The v ideo showed that there was b lowing snow as the helicopter came within about 20 metres  
(m) of the parked helicopter .  On the video t he visibility decrease d to the extent that detail of the 
parked helicopter was barely visible , but a still photograph taken at the same time was much 
clearer  (see Figure 1) .6 
3.1.7.  Instead of landing , the pilot carried out a go-around7 and, according to the senior pilot, radioed 
that this was because he had been  too high  on the approach .  The video showed the helicopter 
moving towards the parked helicopter in blowing s now, then turning left to cross close ly in front 
of it.  The senior  pilot said he rebuked  the pilot for flying too close  to his helicopter , but the pilot 
did not reply. 
3.1.8.  The re -circuit took about one minute.  The video record stopped when the helicopter was 
approximately 50 m from the parked helicopter, and did not  show the collision.8  The senior 
pilot said the helicopter  was about 10 m behind his tail  when it began moving towards him.  He 
                                                        
3 Times are taken from the air traffic control and Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand logs where available; 
otherwise they are from the operator's log . 
4 Another A érospatiale AS350B2, serial number 3625, registered ZK -HAE.  
5 The operator described blowing snow as "loose snow present after fresh snow has fallen, especially if the 
temperature s were cold and the snow has not yet bonded together, obscures ground reference when rotors are in 
ground effect ".  (The Helicopter Line, Operations Manual, section 5.26 , Snow landings affected by weather 
phenomena .) 
6 The still photograph had a greater pi xel count than a standard video camera.  
7 In a go -around the pilot discontinue s a landing approach and re -circuit s for another attempt . 
8 It was likely that the video recorder memory buffer was affected by the impact.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 saw little or no blowing snow  on the second approach , although some of the passengers said 
they saw it .  One of them said the h elicopter was "swaying ", which made him think it was windy . 
3.1.9.  The helicopter  continued to move towards  the parked helicopter  until its lower vertical stabiliser 
and tail rotor hit the main rotor blades of the parked helicopter .  The tail rotor assembly and 
vertical fin separated  from the helicopter and fell in front of and to the right of the parked 
helicopter .

(Still photograph  taken by a  passenger ) 
3.1.10.  Without  a tail rotor, the helicopter  climbed slightly and spun rapidly before tipping forward .  It 
came to rest on its right side about 70 m in front of the parked helicopter .  There was no fire.  
3.1.11.  Because of the location t he senior pilot could not contact the Quee nstown  base directly by radio 
to advise it of the accident.  He shut down his helicopter's engine, told his passengers to remain 
seated and we nt to the crashed helicopter .  He shut down the engine on th e crashed helicopter  
and provided first aid to the  passengers , but the  pilot was unresponsive . 
3.1.12.  The senior pilot returned to his helicopter , broadcast a Mayday call9, to which there was no 
response , and activated the emergency locator transmitter  (ELT)  for his helicopter .  The  search 
and rescue satellite syste m detected the ELT signal at 1514 and notified the Rescue 
Coordination Centre  New Zealand  at 1521 .  The Rescue Coordination Centre called the operator 
at about 1523 to advise that an ELT alert had been received from the parked helicopter.  
3.1.13.  The senior pilot , in the meantime , alternated between helping the injured and going back to his 
helicopter to broadcast  further Mayday call s.  At about 1530 a pilot many kilometres away  
heard one of the Mayday calls and relayed it to air traffic control.  At approximately  1555 t he 
first rescue helicopter arrived at the s ite. 
                                                        
9 Mayday is the internationally recogn ised signal sent by  an aircraft or vessel that is in distress and need s 
immediate assistance.   The call includes the aircraft identification, its location and the assistance required.

 3.1.14.  The accident occurred in daylight at approximately 1508, on a broad snow shelf at the head of 
Snowy Creek, south east of the Tyndall  Glacier .  The elevation (height above mean sea level ) was 
approximatel y 2,050 m . 
3.2. Injuries to persons  
3.2.1.  The pilot received a severe brain injury and some minor fractures , and  was in hospital for 39 
days .  The brain injury caused him a lengthy period of post -traumatic amnesia .  He was 
subsequent ly unable to recall the accident and had limited recall of  the two months prior to the 
accident.  
3.2.2.  All of the passengers in the helicopter  were injured .  Three passengers  required hospital 
treatment , with two of th em remain ing in hospital for two nights.  
3.2.3.  No-one in the parked helicopter was i njured.  
3.3. Damage to aircraft  
3.3.1.  The helicopter  came to rest on its right side (see Figure  2).  The main rotor blades were 
attached but had shattered from striking the snow while under power .  The tail assembly had 
fallen about 1 5 m in front of and to the right of the parked helicopter.  The severed lower 
vertical stabiliser was located, but the removed  section of tail rotor blade was not found.  The 
front -left cabin door was  detached in the ground impact.

The helicopter after the accident (with de -fuelling kit alongside)  
3.3.2.  The visible damage to the parked helicopter  was confined to the outermost half-metre  of each 
of the three main rotor blades (see Figure  3).  The main rotor head and main transmission were  
subjected to s hock loa ding when the main rotor struck the airborne helicopter , and had to be 
replace d.

3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The pilot  had obtained a private pilot licence (ae roplane) in 1982 and a commercial licence in 
1984.  His flying career had primarily involved seasonal scenic flying , mainly in aeroplanes.  This 
had included ski planes, on which he  had logged more than 1 ,100 snow landings, and float 
planes .10  He had logge d approximately 5 ,870 aeroplane hours , with his last aeroplane flight 
being in July 2012 .  He held a C -category aeroplane instructor rating.  
3.4.2.  The pilot had begun  helicopter training in 1999 on the Robinson R22.  He had been  issued with 
a private pilot licen ce (helicopter) in 2000 and a commercial pilot licence (helicopter) in 2001.  
He had obtained a type rating for the Hughes 500 in 2001 and for the Robinson R44 and  the 
Bell 47G in 2002 .  He had flown  helicopter s only occasionally at first and log ged no  helicopter 
flying  between  July 2002 and May 2004.  He  had obtained a night rating in July 2005, but then  
followed another gap in flying until October 2006 when he flew a few frost -protection flights in a 
Robinson R44.  He  had logged no  helicopter flying betwe en November 2006 and June 2008.  
3.4.3.  In October  2008 , when the pilot had 140 hours of helicopter experience,  he had been  hired by a 
scenic flying  company in Rotorua to fly a Robinson R44 .  The company had given  him 3.5 hours 
of dual instruction and 5.7 hours of  command under supervision before allowing him to be a  
pilot in command.  He had obtain ed an AS350  Squirrel type rating with that company  in 
November 2011 .  During  the next 10 months  he had flown  the Squirrel and the R44 
intermitte ntly, as well as a float plane . 
3.4.4.  In September 2012 , when he had accrued approximately 1 ,050 hours of helicopter time,  The 
Helicopter Line had hired him as a full-time Squirrel pilot .  He had flown  6.8 hours under  
training  before being  approved  to act as a pilot  in command .  His tra ining had included 2.65 
                                                        
10 The first entry in the only logbook of aeroplane flying made available  had been  in May 2005, by which time  the 
pilot had accrued 5 ,000 hours.

 hours of  mountain flying instruction.   The record of h is final route check  noted that he had 
performed  "multiple landings in challenging  blowing snow and flat light conditions ". 
3.4.5.  Although the pilot had had experience  in ski-plane operations, the operator's policy  had 
required him to be based on the West Coast of the South Island to gain more experience of 
helicopter operations on snow .  The operator's record s indicated that his training progress had 
been  satisfactory .  According to th e operator, the pilot 's colleagues generally thought him to be 
a steady  pilot with "solid  skill and judg ement ". 
3.4.6.  In February 2013 the pilot had returned to the Queenstown base and been  upgraded to B 
category in the internal competency scheme  then in use by the operator . The B category 
permitted a pilot t o use any landing site, although all flying remained under the supervision of a 
Lead Pilot . 
3.4.7.  The pilot's total helicopter experience at the date of the accident was 1 ,454 hours, of which 
465 hours had been  on the Squirrel.   His logbook  showed that he had landed many times in  the 
Lochnagar Saddle area, but record ed only one  landing at the Tyndall Glacier.  
3.4.8.  The operator's chief pilot said that in August 2013 fellow pilots had expressed  concern that the 
pilot had  misjudg ed his separation from another helicopter while on a photographic flight , and 
that he had made a landing approach that was unnecessarily fast .  The chief pilot said that he 
had responded by  brief ing the pilot  on general flying standards, but he had not formally 
record ed the concerns or the action taken . 
3.4.9.  The chief pilot had been  an observer on  the pilot's next flight crew competency check flight , 
conducted on 22 August 2013 .  The pilot had passed the check , but the chief pilot had 
remained concerned th at the pilot, like some other pilots at the time, had let his standard s slip 
and was display ing a degree of complacency . 
3.4.10.  Subsequently  the pilot had flown  a snow experience flight  in the company of the chief pilot in a 
second Squirrel .  The chief pilot said  that he "could find no fault with [the pilot's] flying or 
airmanship " on that occasion.   As a result , and after favourable comments from  other s about  
the pilot's flying standard , the chief pilot  had considered that the previous  specific performance  
issues  had been rectified . 
3.4.11.  The counselling by way of the briefing from the chief pilot and the monitoring by way of the 
observed check flight were not recorded in the pilot's personal file.  T he operator had no other 
record of the pilot  having receiv ed counselli ng or needing specific retraining.   The chief pilot 
said that it was not unusual  for operational or management issue s that arose  with pilots to be 
dealt with and not recorded, but he agreed later that  the concerns and the action taken  in this 
case  ought to have been recorded.  
3.4.12.  The pilot and his family and associates considered him to be very healthy, fit and active , and 
with no known concerns .  The night before the accident he had gone to bed before 2130.   
Those who saw him on the day of the accident said he  had appeared fit to fly.  
3.4.13.  The senior pilot of the parked helicopter had been employed by the operator for more than 20 
years and had more than 10,6 00 hours of helicopter experience.  He was the Lead Pilot at the 
Queenstown base and had authorised the fligh ts that ended with the accident.  He was very 
familiar with the snowfield  used.  He s aid he had chosen his landing site so that the pilot of the 
second helicopter would have ampl e room to choose his own, suitab le landing site . 
3.5. Aircraft information  
3.5.1.  The Aéro spatiale11 AS350B2 Squirrel helicopter was a higher -gross -weight version of the 
original model designed and manufactured in France in 1974.  It was certified to carry a pilot 
and up to five passengers, but a supplemental type certificate was later approved that allowed 
                                                        
11 The company was later named Eurocopter, and at the time of this report was known as Airbus Helicopters .

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 the replacement of the single passenger seat next to the pilot with a two -place seat.  The six -
passenger configuration was widely used for air transport flights.  
3.5.2.  The helicopter had been  imported from Australia , on lease to the operator , and entered into the 
New Zealand aircraft register on 26 August 2013.   An airworthiness certificate  in the standard 
category had been  issued on 30 August 2013 .  The certificate was non -terminating as long as 
the helicopter was maintained and operated in accordan ce with Civil Aviation Rules .  The 
helicopter had been  maintained in accord ance with  the approved maintenance programme .  
There had been n o recorded maintenance defects since 16 September 2013.  
3.5.3.  The helicopter had flown 3 7 hours since it was imported, and h ad accrued 3,055. 2 hours at the 
time of the accident .  The next scheduled maintenance was a 100 -hour check due at 3 ,118.4 
hours.  
3.5.4.  The Turbom eca 'Arriel ' 1D1 turbo -shaft engine had accrued 3 ,338.15 total hours  at the time of 
the accident . 
3.5.5.  The helicopter was equipped with a Garmin GNS  430 satellite navigation system, a model that 
did not store recoverable data.  
3.5.6.  The helicopter was equipped with a Kannad 406  AF-H model ELT, appropriate to helicopter 
installation.  The ELT had been inspected and tested in accorda nce with the applicable 
requirements in August 2013, but it did not activate during the accident . 
3.5.7.  The helicopter was not fitted, and was not required to be f itted, with a flight recorder.  
Weight and balance  
3.5.8.  The operator had standard loading plans for its scenic flights .  Its operational documentation12 
stated that if passengers were seated in accordance with a standard plan, the helicopter would 
comply with the limitations for all -up weight and centre of gravity position.13 
3.5.9.  The standard loading plan used a st andard weight of 80 kilograms (kg) for each passenger.  
That weight, which had been determined by the operator after conducting a CAA -approved 
survey, avoided the need  to weigh each passenger.  
3.5.10.  The operator had a computer program that could be used to  calcu late the weight and centre of 
gravity position of a loaded helicopter .  The program displayed pictorially the centre of gravity 
position with reference to the allowable range of centre of gravity positions and would generate 
an alert if a weight limit w ere breached.  
3.5.11.  The operator's procedures14 stated that a  weight and balance calculation was not required for 
any flight that was loaded in compliance with a standard loading plan.  The accident flight was 
loaded in compliance with a standard plan for scenic fli ghts.  
3.5.12.  The procedures also stated that p ilots were not required to calculate separately the helicopter's 
weight and balance if a standard loading plan were  used and the passengers were seated 
according to the plan . 
3.6. Meteorological information  
3.6.1.  The accident occurred on the first fine day after two days of heavy snow fall.  The passenger 
video confirmed the excellent flying conditions . 
3.6.2.  There was no cloud and li ttle or no wind  at the time of the accident .  The senior pilot said that 
the wind rose to between five a nd eight knots from the south while they waited for rescue.  The

 pilots of the rescue helicopters said that th e wind was  not more than a slight breeze .  They said 
the temperature was between zero and plus  five degrees Celsius , and the air pressure 1 ,013 
hectopascals . 
3.6.3.  The helicopters approached the landing site on a northerly heading , which put the sun high and 
to the left of the approach direction . 
3.7. Wreckage and impact information  
3.7.1.  The accident occurred on a large snowfield above Snowy Creek, at an elevation of 2,050 m  on 
the south side of Mount Tyndall.   The field had unobstructed approaches from the southeast , 
and sloped down from right to left  when viewed from the approach direction used . 
3.7.2.  The geometry of the collision was estimated from the senior pilot's r ecollection and by 
measuring the angles at which the helicopter's lower vertical fin and one tail rotor blade had 
been severed.  As the landing skids, the lowest part of the helicopter, were not struck by the 
main rotor of the parked helicopter, the helico pter must have been to the front right of the 
parked helicopter at the instant of collision.  
3.7.3.  The helicopter came to rest on its right side approximately 70 m in front  of the parked 
helicopter , heading 90 degrees  left of the approach direction.  
3.7.4.  The cabin wa s intact, although some seat squabs had been removed and used to support the 
occupants while they waited for rescue.  The buckling of the passenger bench seat supports 
and a ground scar from a main rotor blade strike indicated that the helicopter had hit heavily on 
its left side before it  rolled o n to its right side .  The windscreen right pillar was broken near the 
grab handle used by pilots when getting into and  out of their seat.  
3.7.5.  The senior pil ot had turned off the battery and fuel  when he first got to th e helicopter .  The 
hydraulic switch on the collective lever15 was in the guarded (on) position, as was normal.  
3.7.6.  Two of the three main rotor blades were visible; the third was buried in the snow.  The main 
rotor head was shattered  and the blades buckled , whic h indicated that the engine had been 
delivering high power when the rotor blades hit the snow.  
3.7.7.  The engine compressor and turbine showed evidence of having been operating at impact.  The 
power -demand anticipator  for the fuel control unit , which was cable  driven by collective lever 
movement, operat ed correctly.  
3.7.8.  The circumstances of the accident and the damage to the main and tail rotors provided clear 
evidence that the engine had been delivering high power prior to the collision . So the engine 
was not examine d further.  The helicopter manufacturer  agreed with that reasoning.  
3.7.9.  The tail boom was almost completely severed where it attached to the cabin.  The horizontal 
stabilisers were largely undamaged , except the left stabiliser had a tear and bend that had very 
likely  been  caused by a main rotor blade.  
3.7.10.  At Wanaka, the correct movement of the main rotor flight controls was confirmed from the 
pilot's seat to the swash plate.  The tail rotor drive was continuous from the transmission to the 
point where the tail boom  separated.  The tail rotor drive shaft aft of the break showed evidence 
of having been under power when it broke.  The tail rotor drive was thereafter continuous to the 
point where the tail rotor assembly had detached.  The continuity and correct movement  of the 
yaw pedals were  shown, allowing for the break in the tai l boom.   The t ail rotor pitch change 
movement was correct.  
3.7.11.  There was no leakage  of fluid from any component of the hydraulic system that powered the 
flight controls .  The hydraulic pump drive belt was in good condition and the pump turned .  The 
                                                        
15 Collective lever is  the control that changes the pitch angle of a helicopter's main rotor blades by the same 
amount and at the same time, which changes the total rotor thrust, usually to effect a climb or descent.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 hydraulic system filter bypass indicator was not 'popped', indicating that the filter was not 
blocked.  All visible damage was assessed as being a result of the crash.  
3.7.12.  While the wreckage was at Wanaka, t he warning and caution annunciator panel and the Garmin 
GNS 430 integrated communications, navigation and GPS receiver were removed from the 
instrument panel for further examination.   No useful information was obtained from this.  
3.7.13.  The visible damage to the parked helicopter was confined to the outermost half -metre  of each 
main rotor blade.  However, later examination determined that the main transmission and mast 
needed replacement.  
3.8. Medical and pathological information  
3.8.1.  The pilot  had most recently completed a n examination for a CAA medical certificate  on 5 
September 2013.  The issued certificate included a require ment that he have half -spectacles 
readily available  for near -vision  correction . 
3.8.2.  The pilot had informed the  CAA medical examiners that he took medicat ion for occasional 
severe hay fever , but he was reportedly not affected by it on the day of the accident .  Although a 
very low level of a non-sedative hay fever medication16 was detected in a blood sample taken 
after the accident , medical opinion17 was that the medicine would have been t aken more than 
24 hours before  the accident  and that the pilot was very unlikely to have been affected by any 
potentially adverse side  effect s. 
3.8.3.  The operator had a drugs and alcohol policy that permitted random testing, and post-incident 
testing of staff with their consent .  The pilot had passed a random test in June 2013.  An 
analysis of blood and urine samples taken when the pilot was admitted to hospital did not 
detect any alcohol  or illicit drugs.18 
3.8.4.  The Commission's medical c onsultant19 reviewed the notes held by the pilot's general 
practitioner at the time of the accident and assessed them as containing nothing of potential 
relevan ce to the accident .  The consultant also reviewed the hospital records pertaining to the 
injuries  the pilot received and his treatment . 
3.9. Survival aspects  
3.9.1.  The passengers  were from China and  only a few of them underst ood English.  The operator's 
staff had given  the passengers a pre-flight safety briefing in English, supplemented with briefing 
cards writt en in Chinese .  However, some passengers said that they still had not underst ood the 
briefing .  The Commission has recognised previously the difficulty for transport operators of 
ensuring that non -English -speaking passengers receive meaningful pre -trip saf ety briefings.20 
3.9.2.  The safety briefing that was given  included information on the survival and emergency 
equipment carried on board, which was sufficient to supp ort seven people for 72 hours . 
3.9.3.  The first passenger to escape after the crash said that her seat be lt had been  adjusted tightly 
and was hard to undo  with the helicopter on its side.  She could not free the pilot, whose belt 
was too tight .  In helping the others out, she noted t hat the ir seat belts  were loosely fastened.   It 
was not determined whether so me passengers had had loose seat belts from the start of the 
flight or they had loosened  them  subsequently . 
3.9.4.  The senior pilot  was concerned that his own passengers should remain protected i n his 
helicopter  until he had assessed the situation .  He asked if any of them had first aid training,

 but he was not understood.  None of his passengers was involved in helping the injured.   The 
first aid kits and survival packs from both helicopters were used as required.  
3.9.5.  The R escue Coordination Centre  was alerted  to the  accident at 1521 .21  No ELT signal was 
received from the crashed helicopter.22  An aircraft maintenance engineer who arrived on site 
while the rescue was underway said the ELT remote control switch in the cockpit of the crashed 
helicopter was in the 'armed ' position, but the indicator light was not flashing , which meant t hat 
no signal  was be ing transm itted.  The engineer  moved the remote switch to ' on', saw the light 
flash and then left the switch  armed . 
3.9.6.  Later testing showed that the six -axis activation swit ch was satisfactory, but there was no output 
on the primary frequency of 406 megahertz.  The cause of this was not determined.  The output 
of the secondary frequency of 121.5 megahertz was satisfactory.  
3.9.7.  The operator provided flight -following23 with its  trained staff at the Queenstown base, but the 
accident was in an area with poor  radio contact .  Thirty minutes without communication was 
allowed before th e Overdue Aircraft procedure  was to be initiated.  That limit was reached at 
about the time that the Rescu e Coordination Centre informed  the operator  of the beacon  alert . 
3.10.  Organisational and management information  
3.10.1.  The Helicopter Line had been  incorporated in 2002 and was one company in a group  that 
provid ed a range of services to tourists, including helicopter and aeroplane flights.  At the time 
of the accident the company  operated from three  primary bases and two satellite bases in the 
South Island with a fleet of 20 helicopters, mainly the AS350 Squirrel , and 31 pilots , including 
five on a casual basis . 
3.10.2.  The operations manager  was responsible for the overall conduct of air operations and their 
supporting ground operations .  The chief pilot  was responsible for crew training and competency 
assessment s and maintaining operating standards .  The chief pilot at the ti me had been  
appointed in March 2013.  
3.10.3.  The operations manager  stated that  the operator's three biggest  operational risks were:  
 roll-over while landing in flat -light conditions  
 heli-skiing operations  
 a mid -air collision , due to the number of aircraft in popul ar tourist areas.  
These were aggregated under the heading 'Accidents -aviation' in the operator's risk register, 
with generic risk controls that included standard operating procedures, checks and training.  
The operations manager  said that the pilot categor isation scheme was another control that 
was intended to  mitigate the se risks. 
3.10.4.  The operator's procedures listed approximately 30 off -base landing sites, with brief notes on the 
physical attributes of the sites and any precautions to be taken when using the m.24  The list did 
not include the snowfield where the accident occurred , nor any site on the Lochnagar Saddle  
where the pilot had initially ch osen to land .  The two areas  were within the concession area 
granted to the operator by the Department of Conservat ion, which managed the region.25 
3.10.5.  On 17 October 2013 the operator had completed the CAA's re -certification process, which 
recur red every five years and require d 100% compliance with the applicable Civil Aviation Rules.  
The operator  had recognised that its o rganisational changes in the previous four years could 
                                                        
21 The unique identification of  ELTs meant that it was initially thought that the parked helicopter had crashed.  
22 The ELT was a Kannad 406 AF -H model.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 have created new risks, but the CAA's routine surveillance had not disclosed any significant 
operational concerns.  The CAA 's most recent audit prior to the re -certification had been  
completed on 26  November 2012  and made two minor maintenance -related findings . 
3.11.  Other occurrence  
3.11.1.  On 9 January 2014  another of the operator's  Squirrel helicopter s was about to land on the 
Richardson Glacier when  the skid contacted the snow, causing the helicopter to roll on  to its 
side.26,27  The helicopter was destroyed, but the pilot28 and four passengers were uninjured.  
3.11.2.  That accident  occurred at an altitude  of 2,286 m  on a relatively level  glacial snowfield.  The 
stated  weather conditions were  unlimited visibility with neglig ible cloud and no wind.  Snow 
had fallen the previous day and  contributed to bright conditions.  
3.11.3.  According to  the pilot 's report, as he had been  about to land  the surface became less visible in 
the bright light and because of bl owing snow moving ahead as th e helicopter slowed.  The pilot 
had lost sight of his reference points, so he commenced a  go-around.  As he did so t he landing 
skids contacted the snow, causing the machine to roll over  abruptly . 
                                                        
26 The Commission was notified of the accident, but decided not to open a s eparate inquiry .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The accident occurred in weather cond itions that fellow pilots said were "perfect ".  The pilot 
was familiar with the helicopter, the type of o peration and the general  area  where they landed .  
The accident was ver y unusual  in that it was preceded by a near -collision during the prior go-
around . 
4.1.2.  The pilot's injury prevented his recalling the flight.  Therefore the evidence of the senior pilot 
and the video taken by a passenger  were invaluable for the analysis .  The senior pilot was 
seated on the right side of the parked helicopter and had a clear  view of the helicopter during 
the go -around, the last 30 m of the second approach , and the collision.  
4.1.3.  The analysis considers the following possible causes of the collision : 
a. the pilot might have misjudged the approaches and separation  
b. the pilot might have lost visual reference with the other helicopter  
c. the pilot might have lost control because : 
1) of a helicopter defect  or 
2) a helicopter performance  limit was reached  
d. the pilot might have been affected by a medical or psychological condition . 
4.1.4.  In addition, the fol lowing two safety issues identified during this inquiry are discussed:  
 when pilots do not inform their flight -following organisation s of changes to their route s or 
destination s, any search and rescue action that is required c ould be delayed or 
misdirected  
 the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked 
on snow while the rotors are turning  is hazardous . 
4.2. The possibility of the pilot  misjudg ing the separation  
4.2.1.  The landing site that the pilot chose initially was very likely where he  had landed that morning, 
because a passenger on that flight said they had landed on a ridge, not a wide snowfield .  
Although the pilot had logged only one landing at the Tyndall Glacier, it was possible that he 
had made other landings there but had logged them as Lochnagar Saddle.  The flight was a 
standard snow experience flight, for which pilots had flexibility as to where to land.  Landing on 
such an expansive snowfield , with another helicopter as a focal point,  should not have  been 
demandin g for one of the operator's B -category pilots.   Given these circumstances, the lack of 
a description of the Lochnagar Saddle and Tyndall Glacier landing sites in the operator's 
procedures at the time was almo st certainly not a factor in the accident.  
4.2.2.  It wa s very unlikely that the pilot would have minded  the senior pilot taking the lead prior to 
arriving at the landing site.  It could not be determined how often the pilot had followed 
another helicopter to a snowfield landing.  The operator had not specified  a procedure for 
landing multiple helicopters at a single landing area , except that , for snow landings , all of the 
helicopters had to have landed before any passengers would be allowed to disembark.  There 
was no prescribed  minimum spacing between parked h elicopters.  The chief pilot said the rule 
of thumb was one and a half rotor diameters between the rotor discs29, and that rule 
appeared to have been generally followed .  As the main rotor diameter of the AS350 Squirrel 
was 10.7 m, th e rule would give nearl y 27 m between the centres of adjacent landing sites.  
4.2.3.  By comparison, the recommended minimum distance between the centres of adjacent landing 
sites at a heliport intended to serve Squirrel helicopters was 14.6 m (CAA, 2007).  The 
concrete landing pads at t he operator's Queenstown base were a minimum of 14 m apart.  
                                                        
29 A rotor disc is the area swept by a helicopter's  rotor blades each revolution.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO -2013 -010 Therefore the  pilot's normal 'picture' of a  close,  adjacent helicopter was of one that was only 
14 m away, on a clearly defined landing site.  He was sufficiently experienced in operations 
onto u nmarked landing sites, such as  snowfields, and into confined areas that it should have 
been second nature to ensure a safe separation.  
4.2.4.  Having another helicopter land first gives the following pilot a clear reference point in an 
otherwise unmarked landing area, and early warning of a blowing snow problem.  The se 
advantages enable  the following  pilot to ensure a safe separation from the one ahead . 
4.2.5.  There was plenty of space for the helicopter to land to the right of the parked helicopter, 
without encroaching o n the steeper upslope further to the right.  The parked helicopter was an 
excellent visual reference to assist the pilot in judging his rate of closure and spacing.  
4.2.6.  The initial alignment of the pilot's first approach appeared  well spaced, but  the senior pi lot 
thought it was  too fast if the pilot intended to land alongside his helicopter.  The senior pilot 
might have interpreted the blowing snow as a sign that the pilot had had to slow abruptly from  
a high speed.  However, other experienced  pilots of the ope rator considered the pilot's 
approaches , as seen on the video, to be at an appropriate angle and speed.  
4.2.7.  A go-around is usually an undemanding manoeuvre in a helicopter , but the pilot might have 
been annoyed with himself for having had to do so .  Whether th is or the rebuke by the senior 
pilot was a factor in the subsequent accident was discussed with the Commission's consultant 
psychologist .30  In his opinion, if  the pilot had been  in a negative frame of mind he could have 
had a degraded ability to focus on t he landing and simply misjudged the second approach.   
However, the chief pilot was of the opinion that it was in the pilot's nature to have accepted 
the rebuke and to have responded positively.  
4.2.8.  There were aspects of the pilot's performance during the go-around and the accident itself 
that were  similar to the misjudgement s reported  two months earlier  (see paragraph 3.4.9). 
This is a strong indication that this accident  might have been  the result of the pilot having 
made  similar misjudgements , although the pi lot could not recall any such events or having 
been reprimanded for such a concern .  The reported errors in judgement  were serious and  the 
operator ought to have had a written record of  them  and any remedial training that had taken 
place . 
Finding s 
1. The pilo t's training and the monitoring of his performance  were in accordance 
with the operator's training policy and procedures.  
2. In the absence of any other explanation, the possibility that the pilot had 
reverted to his previously reported behaviour and misjudge d his approach 
could not be excluded.  
3. The operator's standard of  record keeping for this pilot's training and 
performance monitoring did not meet generally accepted best practice . 
4. The weather and snow conditions were favourable  and t he parked helicopter 
provided an excellent visual reference for the pilot  to ensure a safe 
separation.  
5. It could not be determined whether the senior pilot's rebuke adversely 
affected the pilot's concentration or spatial judgement on the following 
approach.

 4.3. The possibility of a  loss of visual reference  
4.3.1.  The operator's operations manual guided pilots in coping with ' bright -out'31, blowing snow  and 
a lack of spatial reference.  The manual  stated  that pilots should make an initial approach and 
plan to go around unless conditions clea rly allowed a landing. The manual further 
recommended that:  
In conditions of reduced surface visibility the pilot should not continue an 
approach without visual reference to the snow surface unless reference can be 
achieved by the presence of objects such as flags, rocks, helicopters…  
First approach  
4.3.2.  The surface of the deep, powder snow was easily discerned.  The senior pilot said that he had 
not encounter ed blowing snow  when he landed , and none could be  seen in the video.  His 
approach had been terminated w ithout an obvious flare .32 
4.3.3.  It was very likely that as the pilot of the following helicopter was reducing his speed , the rotor 
downwash lifted the surface snow.  The blowing snow was not so dense as to obscure the 
parked helicopter, but it may have made the rotor disc of the parked helicopter difficult  to 
discern.  
4.3.4.  The accident pilot watched the video five weeks after the accident and commented that the 
blowing snow on the first approach appeared to be  "not too bad".  A photograph taken by a 
rear-seat passenge r showed the parked helicopter more clearly than the video did, and was 
very likely  more representative of  what the pilot saw.33 
4.3.5.  The operator's management  pilots considered  that the amount of blowing snow raised on the 
first approach would have been easily within the pilot's capabilit ies and experience to see 
through and land safely.  The fact that he did not land was not especially significant, but it 
indicated that he made a conscious decision to go around.   The senior pilot said that after the 
pilot began  the go -around the pilot had transmitted what sounded like "too high".  The audio 
on the passenger video was analysed but the pilot's comments could not be determined.  
4.3.6.  A go-around from this position required a climb straight ahead before making a left turn  away 
from the rising terrain.  The pilot misjudged when he had passed  the parked helicopter and 
could turn left .  It was very likely that he  did not realise that he had  converg ed towards the 
parked helicopter during the approach.  In addition, the blowing  snow may have been dense 
enough that  he could not discern the edge of the parked helicopter's rotor disc.  
Finding  
6. It was very likely that the pilot carried out the go -around because he lost his 
depth perception and sight of the other helicopter in blowing  snow . 
 
Second approach  
4.3.7.  The passengers in the helicopter said that the blowing snow at the end of  the second 
approach was worse  than on the first approach , but the senior pilot di sagreed.  Although the 
video stopped before the accident, the senior pilot watched  the approach of the helicopter, 
which he said was similar in angle and speed to the first approach.  The senior pilot saw the 
                                                        
31 Bright -out was descr ibed as " a phenomenon caused by excessive reflection of sunlight off the snow surface, 
resulting in a lack of depth perception, most common when the sun is high in the sky and the snow is fresh ". (The 
Helicopter Line, Operations Manual, section 5.26 , Snow landings affected by weather phenomena .) 
32 In a flare the pilot applies aft cyclic, which produces a rearward rotor thrust component that slows a helicopter.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 helicopter almost come abeam before it seemed  to turn  towards him and a collision became  
imminent.  
4.3.8.  The attitude of the heli copter at the point of collision could not be determined accurately 
without knowing whether the main rotor disc of the parked helicopter was level.  However, it 
was more likely than not  that the parked helicopter's disc was level , in readiness for the 
pass engers ' disembark ation .  If so, t he airborne helicopter was in a more -or-less-level attitude 
at the time of the collision, as determined by the angle at which its vertical stabiliser was 
severed.  A level attitude suggests  that the pilot was not flaring th e helicopter to reduce speed, 
or accelerating for another go -around  or bank ing significantly to the left .  The landing skids, 
which are more than half a metre  below the lowest point of the tail, were not hit by the rotor 
disc, which indicat ed that the heli copter did not directly overfly the parked helicopter.  
4.3.9.  The environmental conditions in this accident had some similarities to the accident on the 
Richardson Glacier a few months later  (see paragraph 3.11.1) : the relatively high altitude; 
clear and bright c onditions; fresh, flat snow; and blowing snow as the helicopter was about to 
land.  However, i n the accident  near Mount Tyndall  the pilot had the parked helicopter as a 
strong visual re ference during both approaches.  
Finding s  
7. It was unlikely that blowing snow s ignificantly  affected the pilot's view of 
the parked helicopter during the second approach.  
 
4.4. The possibility of a loss of control  
4.4.1.  The pilot's flying, judging from the video, was smooth.  That, and the absence of any radio 
communication from him to t he contrary, indicated strongly that the helicopter 's technical 
performance was normal.  No performance limitation was identified .  The passengers' 
evidence did not indicate that the pilot was distracted or that anything interfered with his 
control during either approach.  
Helicopter defect  
4.4.2.  There was nothing in the  passenger video , which began prior to the passengers boarding at 
Queenstown,  to suggest that there was a technical problem or that the pilot had difficulty at 
any stage with controlling the helico pter. 
4.4.3.  The helicopter behaviour, in climbing and spinning after the tail rotor assembly separated, was 
evidence of ample power being delivered to the transmission at the time of the collision.  An 
expert from Airbus Helicopters confirmed that the damage to the main rotor system was 
strong evidence that the rotor had been  under high power when the helicopter struck the 
ground.  For these reasons the engine was not subjected to further examination.  
4.4.4.  The flight controls moved correctly , and continuity of the collective, cyclic and tail rotor 
controls  was shown as far as impact damage allowed.  The hydraulic system (which power ed 
the flight control servo actuators) had no obvious defects  and was not tested further.  
Finding  
8. No technical defect was found that might have contributed to the close go -
around or to the collision.

 Performance limit  
4.4.5.  Three of the key parameters that affect an aircraft 's performance are:  
 its total weight  
 the altitude  
 the air temperature.  
The location of the centre of gravity primarily affe cts stability and controllability.  
4.4.6.  The empty weight of the helicopter was recorded in the helicopter logbook  as 1,327.7 kg .  The  
fuel load on departure from Queenstown was 50% of tank capacity, or 213 kg.34  Using the 
assumptions of the operator's standard loading plan35, the take-off weight of the helicopter 
was later calculated to be 2,129 kg, which was under the maximum permitted weight of 2,250 
kg. 
4.4.7.  No-one calculated the weight or the centre of gravity position before the flight, because one of 
the operato r's procedures waived the requirement when using a standard loading plan.  Had 
the weight and balance calculator been used, the pictorial display would have indicated that 
the centre of gravity was ahead of the forward limit.  
4.4.8.  The passengers were not weighe d before the flight or after the accident.  However, they were 
observed to be lightly framed and generally of short stature.  Therefore, their average weight 
was very likely to have been less than the operator's standard weight of 80 kg.   Using 
hypothetica l passenger weights of up to 75 kg, t he take -off weight was re -estimated  as 2,079 
kg, with the centre of gravity on the forward limit.  Allowing for fuel used during the flight , the 
weight at the time of the accident was estimated to have been  2,037 kg, with the centre of 
gravity then behind the forward limit ( and therefore within limits ) (see Appendix 1).  
4.4.9.  According to the flight manual, at a landing weight of 2 ,037 kg and with an air temperature of 
plus five degrees Celsius , the helicopter could have hover ed out of ground effect36 at a 
pressure altitude of 2 ,700 m, which was about 650 m above the accident site.   This hover 
capability showed that there would have been  adequate power and control for the normal 
manoeuvres associated with landing and take -off at  the lower altitude of the accident site.  
4.4.10.  Although the helicopter weight and centre of gravity position were likely to have been within 
limits for this flight, the operator's procedures risked pilots taking off with their helicopter s 
outside permissible li mits. For example, if six passengers of standard weight were carried with 
a standard 60% fuel load and a pilot weighing 95 kg, the centre of gravity would remain  ahead 
of the forward limit, even with the maximum possible ballast carried in the rear of the 
helicopter.   If pilots checked the weight and balance calculator for every flight, they would be 
alerted  to the actual balance condition.  
4.4.11.  Therefore, the operator's standard loading plans did not guarantee that the weight and centre 
of gravity position woul d be within permissible limits.  As the operator's procedures waived a 
calculation of weight and balance when a standard loading plan was used, and did not require 
pilots to verify weight and balance if a standard loading plan was used, it was very likely that 
potential loading errors could go undetected.  
4.4.12.  The pilot -in-command of an aircraft is required37 to assess the weight and balance information 
and to ensure that the aircraft will remain for the duration of the flight within the limits 
                                                        
34 The fuel quantity indicator scale showed intervals of 10%.  Fuel weights are for a specific gravity of 0.79.  
35 Except 75 kg was used for each front -seat passenger  in order to comply with t he seat weight limit.  
36 A helicopter is 'in ground effect' when the d ownwash from the main rotor  strikes the surface and generates an 
increase in pressure, which effectively creates a cushion of air that reduces the power required to hover.  The 
effect reduces as the helicopter moves away from the surface, with the result t hat more power will be required.  At 
a height equivalent to approximately half of the rotor diameter, the effect is considered to be nil and the helicopter 
is then 'out of ground effect '. 
37 Civil Aviation Rule 135.305 (b).  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO -2013 -010 specified in the f light manual.  The procedures used by the operator in 2013 meant that its 
pilots often did not assess this information, and instead relied on the implied guarantee that 
the standard loading plans would keep them within the limits . 
4.4.13.  The CAA, in allowing the use of standard passenger weights, emphasised that flight manual 
limitations must be observed.38  The operator has since amended its procedures to require an 
actual weight and balance calculation for every flight.  
4.4.14.  Experience with the Squirrel helicopter had  shown  that care was needed to ensure that the 
centre of gravity was not ahead of the forward limit when a dual seat was fitted  and six 
passengers were  carried.39  On 27 November 2015, in an action  unrelated to this accident, 
the CAA issued an airworthiness  directive40 that required the actual weight and balance to be 
calculated before every flight of a Squirrel helicopter when people or cargo occupied the two -
place front seat.41 
Finding s 
9. The helicopter's weight and centre of gravity position were estimated to  
have been within flight manual limits at the time of the accident.  
10. The operator's procedures regarding the use of standard load ing plans did 
not ensure compliance with the Civil Aviation Rule that on all occasions 
helicopters are to be  flown within the li mitations published in the flight  
manual .  In this case the use of the standard load ing plan did not cause or 
contribute to the accident.  
 
4.5. The possibility of a medical or psychological condition  
4.5.1.  There was no obvious explanation for an experienced pilot, performing  a routine and familiar 
flight  in a serviceable helicopter under ideal weather conditions , having a serious collision risk 
twice in a short space of time.  The possibility that t he pilot  misjudg ed the separation between 
the helicopters because  of a medical or psychological condition  was considered . 
Medical condition  
4.5.2.  The medical notes held by the CAA and the pilot's general practitioner contained nothing t o 
suggest that a pre-existing medical condition could have been a factor .  His use of h ay fever  
medication was considered not pertinent, and tests for illicit drugs and alcohol were negative.  
4.5.3.  A passenger on the morning snow landing flight to the Lochnagar Saddle area said that they 
thought the pilot had been  "good, safe and secure , and aware of ever ything ".  A passenger o n 
the later Milford Sound flight  knew the pilot  and said his demeanour had been  "okay ", with 
nothing unusual  noted .  None of the passengers on the accident flight, and no ne of the staff 
who saw the pilot during the day, said they had  noticed anything of concern about the pilot . 
4.5.4.  Before departing Queenstown on the accident flight , the pilot was wearing a cap with 
sunglasses resting above the peak.  It is not known whether he was wearing the sunglasses at 
the time of the accident.  Durin g the approaches to the Tyndall Glacier, the sun w ould have 
been ahead and a bove , and slightly to the left .  Without  sunglasses, glare from the bright snow

Final Report AO -2013 -010 
<< Page 19 >>
 could  have been a problem .  However, t he parked helicopter  would have provided  a good 
contrast with the snow . 
4.5.5.  The pilot's  vision had been checked at a routine CAA medical examination less than two 
months previously .  The requirement that he have half -spectacles available was a common 
age-related requirement, primarily for reading charts and manuals, and not pertinent to this 
flight.  Therefore  it was  unlikely that he had a vision problem  at the time of the accident . 
4.5.6.  The accident pilot did not advise the senior pilot that he was unwell or having  any difficulty  
flying the helicopter .  During  the go -around, the pilot was reported to have said only  that he 
had misjudged his approach angle ; that he was too high .  He did not respond to the senior 
pilot's rebuk e for coming too close .  Had the pilot been affected by a medical condition t hat 
prevented him making a radio call, it would have been very unlikely that he could have mad e a 
steady  approach to land . 
4.5.7.  The video did not show the last 10 seconds or so before the collision, but what was recorded 
suggest ed that the pilot was in full control of the helicopter  on both approaches.   Some 
passengers s aid it was "windy " or that the helicopter was "rocky " or "swaying " on the second  
approach , but the senior pilot said it was not windy.  The passengers may have mistaken 
blowing snow - and possibly the normal vibration that is felt when  a helicopter slows down - 
as an indication of wind.  
4.5.8.  If the passengers' recall of events was not confused by the collision, their description of a 
"rocky " or "swaying " approach could have meant the pilot was over-controlling.   However, the 
senior pilot observed the impending and actual collision and did not see any evidence of over-
controlling . 
4.5.9.  Some neurological disturbances, such as a severe migraine or  a transient ischaemic attack 
('mini -stroke'), can cause impairment or be ongoing risks of incapacitation (CAA, 2010).  It can 
be difficult to prove that such an event ha s occurred , because the re might not be any  
'artefact', or physical evidence.   However, i n the opinion of t he pilot's rehabilitation medical 
consultant , apart from the traumatic h ead injury , "there was no discrepancy in his 
presentation to suggest that there was any other medical/neurological diagnosis that had 
occurred around the time of the crash ". 
Finding  
11. There was no evidence to suggest  that the pilot had a medical condition  
that contributed to the accident , but that possibility cannot be excluded.  
Potential psychological condition  
4.5.10.  Having been unable to identif y any direct caus e of the accident, the Commission co nsidered 
the possibility of an obscure p sychologic al factor.  
4.5.11.  The i nvestigation considered  whether the pilot might have tried so hard to stay clear of the 
parked helicopter  on the second approach that he  experienced an 'ironic process  of mental 
control '.  The theory of this psychological effect , which might  cause  a person  to do exactly 
what they were trying to avoid, is summarised  in Appendix  2.  An example that illustrates the 
theory is a cyclist  hitting an obstruction that they were trying strenuously to avoid . 
4.5.12.  The possible relevance of the theory  is as follows.  The pilot would have been aware that the 
go-around was delaying the snow experience for both groups of passengers.  One would 
expect him to have want ed to complete the go -around quickly  and to make a tidy landing near 
the parked helicopter.  If he had been overly  intent on making a 'perfect' landing  close  to the 
other helicopter, he might have tried too hard to avoid getting  too close and, ironically , flown 
into it. 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO -2013 -010 4.5.13.  However, t he circumstances did not fit the theory well.  Ironic effects require some a dverse 
mental  load.  The go -around might have created some time pressure and the pilot may ha ve 
felt driven to make a better  approach, but those pressures were unlikely to have been of 
sufficient intensity or duration t o provoke an ironic effect.  
4.5.14.  A further  reason to do ubt the applicability of th is theory comes from Wegner's view on the role 
of 'automaticity ' in resisting ironic effects  (Wegner, 1994, p.48) .  Even an experienced pilot 
must give close attention to the desired touchdown point and prevailing conditions, but  the 
manipulation of the controls to achieve the landing is essentially an automatic skill.  The pilot 
was very familiar with landing in confined areas and on landing sites with the minimum 
separation from adjacent sites  (for example, at the operator's bas e).  It was very unlikely  that 
he would have been trying 'too hard' to land close to the parked helicopter  when the parked 
helicopter provided a highly visible point of reference and there was ample space . 
4.6. Summary  of potential causes  
4.6.1.  The analysis considere d the following potential causes of the collision:  
a. misjudge ment by the pilot of his separation  from the parked helicopter  
b. loss of  visual reference with the other helicopter  
c. loss of control because  of a helicopter defect or  because a  performance  limit was 
reached  
d.  the pilot being affected by a medical or psychological condition . 
4.6.2.  The pilot w as experienced in flying onto unmarked landing sites, such as snowfields, and into 
confined areas such that it should have been second nature for him to ensure a safe 
sepa ration.  The landing site was expansive  and the p arked helicopter was an excellent visual 
reference .  The pilot clearly misjudged his spacing twice , but only the first instance c ould be  
explained.  
4.6.3.  The first helicopter landed  without raising any blowing sno w, which might have misled the pilot 
into not reducing his speed sufficiently early on his first approach .  When the pilot did go 
around  because of the blowing snow his helicopter raised, he did not discern the parked 
helicopter's rotor disc and turned too  soon, passing close in front of it. 
4.6.4.  No evidence was found of a mechanical problem with the helicopter, or of its pe rformance 
being  adversely affected .  No medical reason was identified to explain the  pilot's actions .  An 
obscure psychological effect was c onsidered unlikely to have been a contributing factor . 
4.6.5.  The fact that within three months the operator had two accidents during snow landings did not 
necessarily indicate that the operator's standards or training were inadequate.  Snow landings 
are inherent ly hazardous and the operator 's pilots were trained to anticipate blowing snow 
and to perform go-around s if they los t essential visual references.  The nature of helicopter 
operations mean s that they routinely operate close to other aircraft and structures .  Therefore 
it is reasonable to assume that pilots will normally maintain  a safe separation from other 
helicopters and structures throughout every approach and landi ng. 
Finding  
12. The cause of the collision was not determined.

 5. Safety issues  
5.1. The following  safety issues were identified during this inquiry:  
 when pilots do  not inform their flight -following organisation s of changes to their route s 
or destination s, any search and rescue action that is required c ould be delayed or 
misdirected  
 the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter 
parked on snow while the rotors are turning is hazardous.  
 Flight -following  
5.2. The failure of an ELT on a crashed aircraft to transmit a signal, or for the signal to be not 
heard, can have potent ially fatal consequences .  If the alarm  is not raised some other way , 
which fortunately did happen in this case, search and rescue action will not begin until the 
operator determine s that the flight is overdue.  
5.3. Therefore  it is imperative that a flight -following system ha ve accurate information regarding 
the route, destination and intended actions of a flight  being monitored .  An unannounced 
change to the information that was last advised could result in a search  of the wrong  area.   In 
this case the pilot ra dioed the operator's base that the two helicopters were about to land at 
the Lochnagar Saddle, but the actual landing took place about three  kilometres away.   The 
Commission has highlighted this as a key lesson arising from this investigation.  
5.4. The poor rel iability of ELTs is a global issue.   However, t he varied circumstances of aircraft 
crashes mean that 100% reliability might never be achieved.  Severe damage, fire or an 
obstructed or broken antenna are common reasons for signals not being received  after a  
crash . 
5.5. Apart from manufacturers improving the reliability of their ELTs , operators could reduce the 
consequences of un-alerted accident s in remote site s by fitting GPS flight tracking device s.  
Tracking devices have prove d their worth time and again  when ELTs have failed .  At the time, 
the operator had flight trackers  fitted to some of its helicopters , but ne ither of the helicopters 
involved in  this accident had one fitted.42 
5.6. The Commission drew attention to the benefits of flight tracking devices and the poor 
reliab ility of ELTs when it r ecommend ed to the Director of Civil Aviation  on 26 February 2014 
that he43: 
 encourage the use of flight tracking devices, especially for use in aircraft operating in 
remote areas around New Zealand (005/14)  
 continue to suppo rt the international work underway to improve the crash survivability 
of ELTs and to include GPS information in the data transmitted by such devices 
(006/14).  
On 5 March 2014 the CAA replied, in part:  
 (005/14) In our draft recommendation response 31 Januar y 2014, the Director 
commented that the CAA provide for the fitment of Flight Tracking Devices (FTDs) by 
operators and this can be achieved in accordance with the relevant provisions of AC 43 -
14.  The CAA will continue to encourage operators to fit FTDs in  this manner. The CAA 
considers the action sufficient to satisfy the closure of the Commission's 
recommendation  
 (006/14) In the same response letter, the Director commented that the CAA already 
supports in principle the ICAO [International Civil Aviation O rganization] and 
                                                        
42 Since April 2014 the operator had installed flight tracking device s in all of its helicopters , and all of its operating 
bases had dedicated monitoring screen s.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 manufacturers' efforts to improve the crash survivability of ELTs and accuracy of 
position reporting. The work is ongoing and in this context the CAA requests that the 
recommendation be closed.  
5.7. Both safety recommendations remain open.  The Commission has also promoted the benefits 
of flight tracking devices in its  Watch List  item: Technologies to track and locate .44 
 Disembarking while rotors are turning  
5.8. Although not a factor in this accident, a further safety issue identified during the inq uiry was 
the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to helicopter s parked on 
snow while the rotors are turning.  Frequently the pilot will also disembark to guide the 
passengers while they move under the main rotor disc.  There is a  serious risk to people on 
the ground if  a helicopter has settled into fresh snow or it breaks through an apparently hard 
surface crust .  Should this happen  the clearance between the rotor disc and people walking 
beneath could reduce sufficiently for someo ne to be struck by the rotor blades . 
5.9. The risk persist ed in spite of  the operator , in common with other operators, having taken steps 
to reduce it by fitting snowshoes to helicopter landing skids and by training pilots in the correct 
snow landing technique s. 
5.10.  The Director of Civil Aviation informed the Commission of  proposed  Civil Aviation Rules t hat, if 
passed, could  address  the hazard of leaving helicopters unattended w ith the rotors t urning 
under power.45  However, there is no certainty that the proposed ru les will be implemented . 
5.11.  Therefore , the Commission recommend ed that the Director of Civil Aviation ensure that  
helicopter operators that conduct snow landings  address in their safety management systems 
the hazard of passenger disembarkation and embarkation  during those  landings while the 
rotors are turning.

 6. Findings  
6.1. The pilot's  training and the monitoring of his performance were in accordance with  the 
operator's training policy and procedures . 
6.2. In the absence of any other explanation, the possibility that the pilot had reverted to his 
previously reported behaviour and misjudged his approach could not be excluded . 
6.3. The operator's standard of record  keeping for this pilot's training and performance monitoring 
did not meet generally accepted best practice . 
6.4. The weather and snow conditions were favourable  and t he parked helicopter provided an 
excellent visual reference for the pilot to ensure a safe separation.  
6.5. It could not be determined whether the senior pilot's rebuke adversely affected the pilot's 
concentratio n or spatial judgement on the following approach.  
6.6. It was very likely that the pilot carried out the go -around because he lost his depth perception 
and sight of the other helicopter in blowing snow.  
6.7. It was unlikely that blowing snow s ignificantly  affected t he pilot's view of the parked helicopter 
during the second approach.  
6.8. No technical defect was found that might have contributed to the close go -around or to the 
collision . 
6.9. The helicopter's weight and centre of gravity position w ere estimated to have been wi thin flight 
manual limit s at the time of  the accident . 
6.10.  The operator's procedures regarding the use of standard loading plans did not ensure 
compliance with the Civil Aviation Rule that on all occasions helicopters are to be  flown within 
the limitations pub lished in the flight manual.   In this case the use of the standard loading plan 
did not cause or contribute to the accident.  
6.11.  There was no evidence to suggest  that the pilot had a medical condition that contributed to the 
accident , but that possibility cann ot be excluded . 
6.12.  The cause of the collision was not determined.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety  actions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. On 27 November 2015 the CAA issued an airworthiness directive that required the weight and 
balance to be calculated before every flight of a Squirrel helicopter when people or cargo 
occupied th e two -place front seat.46 
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3. None identified .

 8. Recommendation  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendation s to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address t he identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case a recommendation ha s been issued to the Director of Civil Aviation , with 
notice of the recommenda tion given to the New Zealand Helicopter  Association.  
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendation  
8.3. A safety i ssue identified during the inquiry was the widespread practice of allowing passengers 
to leave and return to helicopters parked on snow while the rotors are turning.  Frequently the 
pilot will also disembark to guide the passengers while they move under th e main rotor disc.  
There is a serious risk to people on the ground if a helicopter has settled into fresh snow or it 
breaks through an apparently hard surface crust.  Should this happen the clearance between 
the rotor disc and people walking beneath could  reduce sufficiently for someone  to be struck 
by the rotor blades.  
8.4. On 25 May 2017  the Commission recommend ed that th e Director of Civil Aviation ensure that  
helicopter operators who conduct snow landings address in their safety management systems 
the hazar d of passenger disembarkation and embarkation during those  landings while  the 
rotors are turning . (009/17) 
8.5. On 11 July 2017 the Director of Civil Aviation replied:  
In accordance with the provisions of Civil Aviation Rules Part 119: Air Operator - 
Certificat ion, helicopter operators have until 1 February 2021 to introduce a 
Safety Management System.  Given that timeline, the Director accepts the 
recommendation and will ensure that when  operators' Safety Management 
Systems are certificated all significantr av iation risks are identified and managed.

 Final Report AO -2013 -010 9. Key lessons  
9.1. Transport operators should  keep  formal records of concerns about  operational staff  and how 
they are dealt with .  Record  keeping is consistent with the safety management system goal of 
improving system  quality.  
9.2. Pilots should ensure  that they inform their flight -following organisation s of any changes to 
their operating area s or destination s.

 Appendix 2: Ironic processes of me ntal control  - Key points from research on 
unwanted outcomes  
Wegner (1994)  propose s the theory of 'ironic processes of mental control' to explain why people 
sometimes make the error of doing exactly that which they are trying to avoid.  These errors are mo re 
likely to happen under mental load (such as stress, time pressure, distraction).  An example of an ironic 
error is when efforts to fall asleep result in wakefulness.  
The theory suggests that when we consciously try to produce a desired thought or action , we also 
unconsciously monitor for the unwanted thought or action.  The purpose of this 'ironic monitoring' is to 
ensure that we actively avoid the unwanted state.  
As Wegner explains (Wegner, 2009, p.48), "The conscious search for distractions and the unc onscious 
search for the unwanted thought work together to achieve suppression  - the conscious search doing 
the work and the unconscious search checking for errors ".  Mental load, such as stress or distraction, 
can impair the conscious effort to produce the  wanted state.  But the unconscious search for errors 
requires less effort and therefore remains less affected when mental load increases.  So the search for 
errors continues and, through the process of cognitive priming, can produce the very state to be 
avoided.  
LoRusso (2009, p.4) cite s research providing evidence for the theory of ironic processes in several 
areas of mental control: the control of sleep (Ansfield, Wegner & Bowser, 1996), the control of anxiety 
(Koster, Rassin, Crombez & Naring, 2003), wh en trying to relax when under stress (Wegner, Broome & 
Blumberg, 1997 ) and in mood control (Wegner, Erber & Zanakos, 1993).  
Less research has been found in the area of ironic effects of the mental control of action, although 
some has been conducted in rela tion to sporting performance.  For example, Wegner, Ansfield and 
Pilloff (1998) conducted an experiment involving golf putting, and concluded that "distraction can 
undermine motor control to produce not only erroneous movement, but precisely the least want ed 
movement " (p.199).  LoRusso (2009), who used tennis players as subjects, concluded that "trying not 
to perform some action under pressure can bring about those exact unwanted actions " (p.ix).  
Being relaxed and avoiding distractions helps to avoid counte r-intentional effects.  Wegner also 
suggest s that the "automatization " of the operating process raises the resistance to ironic effects 
(Wegner, 1994, p.48).  Skilled behaviour follows training and repeated practice in intentional actions to 
the point that  they become automatic.  The actions become easier  and require less thought and the 
results are more accurate (fewer errors).  However, when conscious attention is given to exactly what 
one is doing during an otherwise automatic action, the error count oft en increases.  Wegner suggest s 
that when attention is given to the details of an action, it becomes intentional rather than automatic, 
and as a result the resistance to errors is lost.  
An alternative to the theory of ironic processes is that of overcompens ation.  De la Peña, Murray and 
Janelle (2008, cited in Toner, Moran & Jackson, 2013) propose the "implicit compensation hypothesis ".  
Toner et al. (2013) contrast the two theories.  They explain that the theory of ironic processes of mental 
control suggest s that an instruction not to act in a particular way may result in that very action being 
taken, especially under cognitive load; however, the implicit overcompensation hypothesis predicts that 
instructions to avoid a behaviour lead to the opposite action regardless of cognitive load.  Toner et al. 
(2013) conclude d from their research (using golfers as subjects) that unskilled players were more likely 
to overcompensate than more experienced players.
