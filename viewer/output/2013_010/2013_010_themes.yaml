- name: Pilot's Spatial Judgement and Approach Misjudgment
  explanation: The theme of pilot's spatial judgement and approach misjudgment is relevant to this accident as the pilot misjudged his spacing from the parked helicopter during the landing approach, which was a contributing factor to the near-collision and subsequent collision. The analysis indicated that "the pilot clearly misjudged his spacing twice" (4.6.2), and despite the favorable conditions and the parked helicopter serving as an excellent visual reference, the pilot failed to ensure a safe separation (4.6.2). Additionally, the pilot's previous behavior of misjudging approaches was noted, and "the possibility that the pilot had reverted to his previously reported behaviour and misjudged his approach could not be excluded" (6.2).
- name: Visual Reference Loss in Blowing Snow
  explanation: Loss of visual reference in blowing snow is a safety theme because the pilot likely carried out the go-around due to loss of depth perception and sight of the other helicopter in blowing snow (6.6). The analysis considered the possibility that the pilot might have lost visual reference with the other helicopter due to blowing snow (4.1.3.b). Although it was unlikely that blowing snow significantly affected the pilot's view during the second approach (6.7), the first go-around was attributed to the pilot not discerning the parked helicopter's rotor disc and turning too soon (4.6.3).
- name: Helicopter Performance and Weight Management
  explanation: Helicopter performance and weight management is a safety theme because the analysis included consideration of whether a performance limit was reached due to the helicopter's weight and center of gravity position (4.4). The helicopter's weight and center of gravity were estimated to be within flight manual limits at the time of the accident (6.9), and the operator's procedures regarding the use of standard loading plans did not ensure compliance with the Civil Aviation Rule that helicopters are to be flown within the limitations published in the flight manual (6.10). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of accurate weight and balance calculations for safe helicopter operations.
- name: Medical or Psychological Conditions Affecting Pilot Performance
  explanation: The theme of medical or psychological conditions affecting pilot performance is relevant as the investigation considered whether the pilot's actions could be explained by a medical or psychological condition (4.5). There was no evidence to suggest that the pilot had a medical condition that contributed to the accident, but this possibility could not be excluded (6.11). The analysis also explored the potential for an "obscure psychological effect" but found it unlikely to have been a contributing factor (4.6.4).
- name: Flight Following and Communication of Route Changes
  explanation: Flight following and communication of route changes is a safety theme because the investigation identified a safety issue where pilots do not inform their flight-following organizations of changes to their routes or destinations, which could delay or misdirect any required search and rescue action (5.1). In this case, the pilot radioed the operator's base that the two helicopters were about to land at the Lochnagar Saddle, but the actual landing took place about three kilometers away (5.3). This highlights the importance of accurate and timely communication for effective flight following and search and rescue operations.
- name: Risks Associated with Disembarking with Rotors Turning
  explanation: The risks associated with disembarking with rotors turning is a safety theme identified during the inquiry, which pertains to the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked on snow while the rotors are turning (5.1). Although not a factor in this accident, the practice poses a serious risk to people on the ground if a helicopter settles into fresh snow or breaks through a surface crust, potentially reducing clearance between the rotor disc and people walking beneath (5.8). This theme underscores the need for safe procedures during passenger disembarkation and embarkation in snowy conditions.
