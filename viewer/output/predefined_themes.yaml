    Recreational boat users: essential knowledge and skills
  description: |
    New Zealand’s maritime rules place no obligations on recreational boat users to demonstrate that they understand and practise safe boating behaviour before getting on the water. Although recreational boat users are legally required to observe the rules covering boating, they are not required to show that they know them, or have the skills needed to comply.

    Technologies to track and to locate
  description: |
    The operators of aircraft, ships and boats, and rail vehicles underuse currently available tracking technologies, for example ATC (Automatic Train Control) in the rail sector; and locating technologies such as ELT (Electronic Location Transmitter), PLB (Personal Locator Beacon), EPIRB (Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon). Such technologies can reduce the risk of things going wrong, improve survival chances after an accident occurs, help ensure a lost vehicle and its occupants are found, and help us to learn what went wrong in order to improve safety.

    Performance impairment from substance use
  description: |
    Judgement, decision-making, and reaction time can all be affected by the use of drugs or alcohol. The use of performance-impairing substances by persons performing safety critical tasks in a transport environment is a significant risk. The Ministry of Transport supports zero tolerance of operator impairment; however, industry arrangements are uneven across the sectors and more could be done to manage this risk.

    Robinson helicopters: mast bumping accidents in NZ
  description: |
    Mast bumping accidents have raised concerns about the risks of flying Robinson helicopters in the mountainous terrain and weather conditions that are common in New Zealand. Mast bumping is contact between an inner part of a main rotor blade or a rotor hub and the main rotor drive shaft (or ‘mast’). Serious mast bumping in flight usually results in the helicopter breaking up in flight, which is fatal for those on board. Part of the problem is that the available evidence has not allowed the circumstances and causes of all of these ‘mast bumping’ accidents to be fully determined.

    Safety at level crossings
  description: |
    Safety for pedestrians and vehicles using railway level crossings is being compromised because of ambiguities in the responsibilities between the road and rail authorities; and because the implications for the road-rail interface are sometimes not recognised when changes are made to vehicle technology or rail infrastructure.

    Safety for workers in the rail corridor
  description: |
    The protection of people working in the rail corridor (road or rail workers) is a safety-critical process. It needs several things working together: policies and rules to ensure a work area is clear of personnel and machinery before trains are authorised to enter, guidance and training for workers on how to adhere to the rules in practice, and systems to ensure workers are fit for duty. Any confusion about the procedures to be followed, or a lack of adherence to them for whatever reason – such as miscommunication or impairment – can significantly increase the likelihood of a serious, potentially fatal, event.

    Navigation in pilotage waters
  description: |
    Deficiencies in bridge resource management, an international standard for ensuring safe navigation of a ship, have been a feature of these incidents. Errors in navigation in pilotage waters have the potential to have serious consequences for people, the environment, and commerce. * Pilotage waters are those areas in which a ship is usually required to use the services of a maritime pilot (there are sometimes exemptions). A maritime pilot is an experienced and highly skilled sailor who has detailed knowledge of a particular waterway.

    Resilience of transport infrastructure to extreme weather
  description: |
    The importance to transport safety of resilient infrastructure was highlighted by the extreme weather that the northern areas of New Zealand experienced in January and February 2023. Climate change scientists expect that as Earth warms, extreme rainfall will become more frequent. Extreme rainfall can result in flooding or land slips and can also increase erosion. These events cause a risk to transport infrastructure across aviation, rail, and maritime modes.

    Safety management systems: regulator monitoring
  description: |
    Safety management systems are at the heart of how society manages risks. They are key to the safe operation of any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel. To be successful a safety management system should identify all hazards and risks and have successful control mechanisms in place. Those operating the vehicle or vessel must fully understand the safety management system and the part they play in its successful implementation.

    Systems for maintenance
  description: |
    For any rail vehicle, aircraft, vessels, and infrastructure, it is important that it is well maintained mechanically. The failure to do so can lead to critical failures and in turn this can result in accidents. All operators should ensure that they have processes in place that include maintenance of all mechanical parts. Particular attention should be given to safety critical parts. Through monitoring and auditing regimes, Regulators have an important role to play in ensuring that safety critical systems are properly maintained.
