 About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of 
inquiry and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquirin g into maritime, aviation 
and rail accidents and incidents for New  Zealand, and co -ordinating and co -operating with 
other accident investigation organisations overseas.  
The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of 
occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  It is not the 
Commission’s purpose to ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (or to assist an 
agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or agen cy. However, 
the Commission will not refrain from fully reporting on the circumstances and factors 
contributing to an accident because fault or liability may be inferred from the findings.

Verbal probability expressions  
Where possible, the Commission uses standardised terminology in its reports. This is for the 
benefit of investigation particip ants, readers of its reports, and recipients of its 
recommendations. One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe 
the degree of probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in 
support of a hypothesis . 
This terminology, set out in the table below, has been adopted by the Commission based on 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau 
models. The Commission chose these models due their simplicity, usability, and international 
use. The Commission considers the suitability of these models as being reflective of the 
Commission’s functions, which include the making of findings and recommendations based 
on a wide range of evidence received, whether or not that evidence  would be admissible in a 
Court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
What happened  
 At about 0730 on Monday 10 February 2020 a truck approached Mulcocks Road level 
crossing , in the Waimakariri District  of Canterbury , heading towards State Highway 71.  
 The flashing lights and bells at the level crossing were  activated by the approaching 
Coastal Pacific passenger train.  
 The truck slowed as it approached but did not complete ly stop short of the level 
crossing . Instead , the truck continu ed to move slowly forward onto the level crossing 
and into the path of the train.  
 The train driver sounded the train’s horn upon realising the truck was not stopping. 
This alerted the truck driver but it was too late for them to take avoiding action.  
 The train collided with the driver side of the truck’s cab. The truck driver  was fatally 
injured in the collision.  
Why it happened  
 The truck driver had very likely1 recognised the activated flashing lights and bells and 
had intended to keep the truck stopped short of the level crossing until after the train 
had passed and it was safe to continue.  
 The truck driver  had very likely  diverted their attention to some  distract ion inside the 
cab while believing the truck to be fully stopped. The truck driver was engaged in an 
incoming mobile phone call at this time, which may have contrib uted to the m 
becoming distracted.  
 The truck driver did not keep sufficient pressure on the brake pedal  of the automatic -
transmission truck , allow ing the truck to slowly move forward . 
 Closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing, recommended in a report2 18 months prior as 
a possible risk-reduction measure  would virtually certainly have prevented this 
accident.  Fitting half -arm barriers to Mulcocks  Road level crossing, a  secondary 
recommendation made in the same report, would very likely  have prevented th is 
accident . No formal assessment had been undertaken by Waimakariri District Council 
or KiwiRail  to determine if th ese recommended measures were ‘ reasonably practicable ’ 
to implement , and no process or meaningful guidance existed  for such an  assessment . 
KiwiRail have sin ce taken  safety  action to  begin  formalis ing a policy for this, and the 
Commission has made a recommendation  for this policy  to consider the most 
complete risk  estimates available . 
What we can learn  
 Road users must avoid distractions and maintain awareness of their surroundings when 
approaching level crossings.

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 
 The s election of level crossings for detailed risk assessment or upgrade does not 
reliably prioritise New Zealand’s highest risk  level crossings. The Commission has  made 
a recommendation  that KiwiRail and Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency  examine how 
Australasian level crossing assessment model ( ALCAM ) and other existing data sources 
can be  utilised to better guide this selection.  
Who may benefit  
 Rail access providers, road controlling authorities , level crossing  assessors  and all other 
stakeholders for level crossing risk may benefit from the findings, safety issues and 
recommendations in this report.  
 Investment d ecision -makers for roading and rail infrastructure  may benefit from the 
findings, safety issues and recommendations in this report.  
 Road users  interacting  with level crossings  may benefit from the findings and key 
lessons  in this report .

 2 Factual information   
Narrative  
 At about 0730 on Monday  10 February 2020, the driver of a flatbed truck3 (the truck) 
departed from their workp lace adjacent to Mulcocks Road  level crossing  (the level 
crossing) in Flaxton  within the Waimakariri District of Canterbur y. The truck turned left 
from the compound onto Mulcocks Road  and approached the level crossing . 
 At the same time the Coastal Pacific passenger train  (the train)  was approach ing the 
level crossing northbound from Christchurch to wards  Picton  carrying 98 passengers . 
 Meanwhile a car was at the intersection of  Bramleys Road  and State Highway ( SH) 71 
Lineside Road , opposite the level cro ssing, waiting  for a gap in traffic to allow it to turn 
right onto the northbound lane of SH71 Lineside Road. The  car was directly opposite 
Mulcoc ks Road level crossing and  its driver , who was the only identified witness to this 
accident  (the witness) , observed the truck’s approach.  
  
Figure 3: Route of truck , path of train  and position of witness  
 Mobile phone  records showed  the truck driver accepted an incoming call  at 0730:50 . 
 The train activated the level crossing ’s flashing lights and bell s (see Figure 4)  as it came 
within 535  metres of  the level crossing , about  21 seconds before reach ing it .4

Figure 4: Mulcocks Road level crossing and approach to S tate Highway 71 
(photo taken after accident  and subsequent repair of  damaged  flashing light s and bells ) 
 The train driver observed the truck approaching the level crossing at a  very slow speed 
and was confident  that the truck w as stopping . The train driver then turned their 
attention to road traffic  travelling parallel to the train on SH71  Lineside Road that 
could  potentially  turn left on to Mulcocks Road and into the path of the train.  
 The witness recalled observing the truck slow to a crawl as it approached the level 
crossing, but not coming to a complete stop. The y also recalled  observ ing the truck 
driver reaching down into the left -side passenger area , looking  away from the 
approaching train.  
 As the train approach ed the level crossing  it was travelling  at 92  kilometres per hour .5 
The train driver realised the truck was  advancing  beyond the level crossing’s limit line 
and sounded the train ’s horn  about 75  metres , or 3 seconds , before the train reach ed 
the level crossing . 
 The witness observ ed the truck driver look up and to their right  to see the train 
approaching after its horn sounded . There was insufficient time for the truck driver  to 
react  and, at 0731:37 , the train collided with the truck . 
 The collision severed the  train’s  brake pipe6 and t he sudden loss of air pressure  
automatically applied the train ’s brakes  to their maximum effort . The train came to a 
stop 509 metres pas t the point of collision .

 The truck was struck on the side of the driving cab . It spun anti -clockwise and 
overturned onto the driver side. The truck driver suffered fatal injury as a result of the 
collision.  
 The train driver immediately contacted train control7 and requested the attendance of 
emergency services at the level crossing.  The witness was the first to the  truck and 
attempted to give first aid to the truck driver.  
 There were no injuries sustained by the train’s crew or its passengers in the collision.  
Personnel  information  
The truck driver  
 The truck driver had worked adjacen t to Mulcocks Road level crossing for 
approximately three years and was familiar with the level crossing.  
 The truck driver held a standard Class  1 car licence , which was  the appropriate licence 
for the truck.  
 The truck driver  had not worked the previous d ay, a Sunday, and had been at work  for 
approximately 90  minutes before the collision.  
 Post-accident toxicology results were negative.  
The train driver  
 The train driver had 36  years’ experience in their role  and had current certification . 
 The train driver’s roster did not indicate any areas of concern regarding fatigue.  
 KiwiRail did not require train drivers involved in level -crossing accidents to be drug and 
alcohol tested.  
Vehicle  information  
The truck  
 The truck was a 2011 Isuzu Elf.  It had an automatic transmission , a twin -tyred rear axle ,8 
and was approximately 6 metres long . 
 
7 The national train control centre housed in Wellington Railway Station whe re train movements and track  
occupations are authorised by train controllers.  
8 An axle featuring four tyres in total, with two tyres on each side , and able to carry  greater axle loads than a 
single -tyred axle.

Figure 5: The truck prior to  the accident  
 On 3 February 2020, a week prior to the accident, the truck driver presented the truck 
for a Ce rtificate of Fitness (CoF) inspection . The truck failed the inspection because 
three of the truck’s four rear tyres had a tread depth below the legal limit. These  three  
tyres had not been replaced at the time of the accident. In all other aspects the CoF 
inspection  found the truck to be in good working order , including its braking system.  
 Post-accident , a New  Zealand Police Commercial Vehicle Safety Team officer  inspected 
the truck and found the brake linings to be in good condition , with no signs of 
excessive wear or damage.  
 The truck ’s dashboard was fitted with a magnetic mounting bracket  that interfaced 
with a corresponding magnetic coupling  on the protective case  of the  truck driver’s 
mobile  phone . The driver’s mobile phone was found ou tside of the truck cab  after the 
accident.  
The train  
 The train was made up  of the diesel -electric locomotive  DXR8022  hauling  an AKL 
luggage  van, four  AK class passenger carriages , and an AKV class  combined generator 
van and  observation car.  
 The train was one of four scheduled trains to pass Mulcocks Road level crossing  on the 
day of the accident.  In February 2020 , there were  between  two and six scheduled train 
movements per day (see Table 1 below ). Work trains and non -train rail movements , 
such as track maintenance vehicles , would be additional to scheduled trains and var y 
day by day.

Meteorological information  
 On the day of the accident the weather was fine, with little cloud and no rain.  
 At the time of the accident the sun was  rising just above the tree line on the opposite 
side of SH71  Lineside Road  to the truck, approximately  8° above the horizon.  The sun 
was positioned ahead and to the right in the truck driver’s field of view as they 
approached the level crossing , or approximately the ir 2 o’clock position .9 
Mulcocks Road level crossing  
Layout and complexity  
 Mulcocks  Road level crossing is adjacent to a cycleway and a no -exit residents’ access 
road (Paisley Road) on its south -western side, and to SH71  Lineside Road  on its north -
eastern side  (see Figure 6 below ).

Figure 6: Mulcocks Road level crossing and surrounding road junction s  
(Credit: N ew Zealand  Police Christchurch Serious Crash Unit post -accident scene survey  
with additional information superimposed)  
 There is limited stacking distance10 on the north -eastern side of Mulcocks Road level 
crossing, with only 5.9 metres between the centre of the rail tracks and the edge of 
SH71 . 
 The road rises on both approaches to the level crossing , making it difficult for road 
users to assess the available stacking distance before they commit to traversing the 
level crossing.  
 There are no deceleration or acceleration slip roads off or on to SH71  Lineside Roa d for 
negotiat ing the turn, both for:  
• north-west bound road traffic on SH71 entering Mulcocks Road  
• left-turning  road traffic exiting Mulcocks Road to join SH71  Lineside Road . 
 There is no turning bay for south -east bound road traffic  on SH71 Lineside Road 
turning right into Mulcocks Road . 
Protection  
 Mulcocks Road  level crossing  was protected by flashing lights and bells , activated by a 
track circuit11 535 metres  before the level crossing.  
 The witness recalled seeing the flashing lights on the  SH71  Lineside Road  side of the  
level crossing operating shortly before and then during  the collision . They also recalled  
hearing the bells sounding in the immediate  period  following  the accident.

 KiwiRail’s attending Rail Incident Coordinator (RIC) confirmed the bells were sounding 
when  they arrived at the scene  at about 0809 . The bells were later shut off by a KiwiRail 
signalling technician.  
 The flashing lights and bells that faced the truck as it  approached the level crossing 
were heavily damaged in the collision  (see Figure 7).

Mulcocks Road l evel crossing jurisdiction and responsibility  
 Responsibility for level crossings is complex in that it overlaps amongst rail ac cess 
providers and road controlling authorities (RCAs).  
 Mulcocks Road level crossing’s proximity to SH71  Lineside Road  means there are three 
agencies with maintenance interests :12 
• KiwiRail , as the rail access provider , is responsible for the formation and 
maintenance of the road surface 5 metres  either side of the centre line of the 
railway line.  They are  also responsible for the maintenance of flashing lights and 
bells and any other  active protection13 systems.  
• Waimakariri District Council  (the Council ) is the RCA for the district and is 
responsible for all local roads, excluding private and state highway s. The Council is 
responsible for the formation and maintenance of the road surface beyond 5 metres 
either side of the railway centreline  and all  associated pavement marking related to 
the level crossing, regardless of the 5 -metre distance.  
 
12 As defined in Traffic Control Devices Manual Part 9 Level Crossings, Waka Kotahi New  Zealand Transport 
Agency, Second Editio n amendment, 1 December 2012.  
13 Includes all level crossing warning devices that are activated by an approaching train, including flashing lights, 
bells and barriers. It is contrasted by passive protection, which warns users of a level crossing, but does n ot alter 
this warning when a train is approaching.

Risk assessment for Mulcocks Road level crossing  
 An overview of  the processes used to assess and manage level crossing risk in 
New Zealand is included as Appendix 1  of this report. This section provides factual 
information for  risk assessment activities  undertaken for  Mulcocks Road level crossing 
prior to the accident.   
 In 2016  and 20 17, the Council constructed the Rangiora -to-Kaiap oi cycleway, parts of 
which run alongside  the M ain North Line railway . This cycleway crossed both Mulcocks 
Road and nearby Fernside Road alongside each road’s level crossing.  
 In 2017, after  the cycleway was completed, KiwiRail’s Project Management Office 
requested  that the Council conduct a level crossing safety impact assessmen t (LCSIA ) 
for both Mulcocks Road and Fernside Road  level crossings . 
 The requ ested  LCSIAs were conduc ted by Stantec and a  combined  report14 was 
delivered to the Council in July 2018.  
 At this time  Mulcocks Road  level crossing  had a published Australasian level crossing 
assessment model ( ALCAM ) risk score of 24.1.15 This equate s to an estimated annual 
probability of 0. 241per cent  for an equivalent  fatality ,16 or an estimated 415 years 
between equivalent fatalities.  
 Mulcocks Road level crossing’s  ALCAM risk score was the 260th greatest amongst 
New Zealand ’s roadway  level crossings . This put it in the ‘high risk’ band  for ALCAM’s 
New Zealand jurisdiction17 – mean ing it was inside the top 20 per cent  of level 
crossings for ALCAM risk score . 
 The LCS IA report determined Mulcocks Road level crossing , in its existing state, to have 
a level crossing  safety score (LCSS )18 of 43/60.  
 The LCSIA report c onsidered the following risk treatments, as identified by the safety 
review team undertaking the assessment . 
• Installation of half-arm barriers .19 
• Installation of short -stacking20 warning signage for road users . 
• Installation of level crossing signage on cycling routes . 
• Installation of flashing lights and bells to face  the south side of the cycleway . 
• Signage and pavement marking to be installed  or reinstated . 
 
14 WDC Rangiora -to-Kaiapoi Cycleway LCSIA, Stantec NZ Ltd, July 2018.  
15 Erroneously recorded as 30.9 in the LCSIA report. Accounts for updated 2018 annual average daily traffic 
estimates, but otherwise  it was the known ALCAM risk score prior to Stantec’s LCSIA being undertaken.  
16 A unit that ALCAM uses for injury equivalence, defined as 1 fatality, 10 major injuries or 200 minor injuries.  
17 ALCAM groups level crossings into separate jurisdictions for Austral ian states and territories and New  Zealand. 
Level crossings within each jurisdiction are then evenly distributed into five ALCAM risk bands based on their 
ALCAM risk score.  
18 An out -of-60 score that reflects the risk associated with a level crossing, with 60/60 being the greatest possible 
risk. Incorporates ALCAM risk scores with other more subjective risk estimation methods.  
19 Physical barriers at a level crossing that are automatically lowered a short period after flashing lights and bells 
have been acti vated. Vehicles on the level crossing can exit the level crossing control area because the barriers

 • Road surface improvements  or repairs . 
• Installation of whistle boards to ensure approaching trains sound their horns . 
 The report concluded that these treatments would lower Mulcocks R oad level 
crossing’s  LCSS to 31/60. This did not meet the LCSIA  process’ preferred  ‘Criterion 1’,21 
but did meet ‘Criterion 2’22 by lowering the LCSS from its existing valu e. 
 For ‘Criterion 1 ’ the report recommended , ‘if reasonably practicable ’, to close the level 
crossing. The report reasoned that, given the low traffic volumes on Mulcocks  Road 
and the alternative routes available, it was not expected that many road users would be 
adversely affected by closing the level crossing and Mulcocks Road’s exit onto SH71  
Lineside Road . 
 The LCSIA process require d that closure of the level crossing  be assessed  first for ‘so 
far as is reasonabl y practicab le’ (SFAIRP ).23 If closure was found  not reasonably 
practicable  then half-arm barriers and other  risk treatments  per 2.47 were next 
required to be SFAIRP -assessed . 
 The LCSIA report and its recommendations were discussed between the Council and 
KiwiRail.  No formal SFAIRP assessment was undertaken  and no documented  record  of 
discussions  was made , but the following  consideration was given to  each of the 
recommended  risk treatment s. 
• Closure  was identified by the Council as challenging due to Mulcocks Road  
providing  a detour route during periods of closure for SH71 Lineside Road , 
including  when road accidents occur .  
• Installation of half -arm barriers  did not proceed because of Mulcocks Road level 
crossing not being inside  KiwiRail’s ‘Top 200 ’ list of ALCAM risk scores . 
 Waka Kotahi , as the RCA for SH71  Lineside Road , would have needed to be consulted 
on Mulcocks Road level crossing’s closure . However , they were not otherwise 
responsible for the level crossing and were not inc luded  in discussi ng the LCSIA report  
or its recommendations .

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 3 Analysis  
Introduction  
 A collision between a large road vehicle and a passenger train travelling at 90 
kilometres per hour is a serious incident with potential ly serious consequences.  It has 
the potential  to derail the train, injur e persons  and cause significant dam age to 
equipment.  
 There are approximately 1500 public level crossings throughout New Zealand . Except 
for rail passengers  at platforms and onboard  trains , these level crossing  sites account 
for the vast bulk of instances where members of the public  enter th e rail corridor  and 
are consequently put at risk . Considerable effort has been made to  improv e protection  
at level crossings , which has requir ed substantial resources and funding.  Despite  these  
ongoing safety improvements , level crossings remain a significant risk  and one that can 
be expected to grow with increasing road and rail traffic . 
 The Commission’s analysis for this accident examine s its immediate causes and 
circumstances. It also examines the wider issues surrounding risk assessment and  risk 
management for level crossings, of relevance  due to Mulcocks Road  level crossing  
being one of a limited number to have undergone assessment under the recently -
developed LCSIA process.  
Distracted driving  
 The Commission determined the flashing lights and be lls were virtually  certain  to 
have been working correctly at the time the  truck approached the level crossing . The 
witness’ account of seeing the flashing lights , and the RIC’s account of the flashing 
lights and bell s still being active when they attended the site , both support this.  
 Separate independent accounts  from  the witness and the train driver  observed the 
truck slowing significantly before it reached the level crossing. The Commission have 
therefore found it very likely  that its driver reco gnised and reacted to the active 
flashing lights and bells , intending to stop the truck before the level crossing and then 
remain stopped until after the train had passed.  
 The truck’s slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the lead -up to the coll ision 
was very likely  due to its driver  not applying sufficient pressure to the brake pedal. 
Other explanations for this forward crawl, such as mechanical failure of the truck’s 
braking system  or the driver’s foot slipping completely  from the brake pedal , were 
considered in the Commission’s analysis . These were eventually discounted because no 
such issues were noted in the truck’s pre -accident or post -accident inspections and 
there were no witness accounts of any  apparent attempt by its driver to react to s uch a 
failure  or error . 
 The Commission found no evidence of the truck losing traction with the road surface 
prior to the collision, and it is therefore exceptionally unlikely  that the low tread on 
three of the truck’s four rear tyres contributed to this accident in any way.  
 It is very likely  that the  truck driver’s  peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were 
restricted and as a result they were unable to detect the truck’s subtle forward 
movement. This assessment is based on the  truck’s  slow forward crawl itself and the 
witnes s’ observation of its driver looking down towards, and reaching with their left 
 
Final Report RO -2020 -101 |  
<< Page 13 >>
 arm into, the passenger side area. It is very likely the truck driver believed the truck to 
be stationary and  felt it safe to divert their attention from the truck’s surroundin gs. 
 The Commission was unable to determine  the precise  source of  the distraction that 
caused the  truck’s  driver to divert their attention  away  from the truck’s surroundings.  
 New Zealand  law prohibits  the use of  mobile phones while driving  road vehicles. An 
exception to this is that a driver may, while driving a vehicle, use a mobile phone  for 
telephone  calls if: 
• the phone is secured in a mounting fixed to the vehicle  
• the driver manipulates the phone infrequently and briefly . 
 The Commission was unable to determine if the truck  driver  was utilising the hands -
free mounting fitted to the truck dashboard at the time of the accident. The magnetic 
coupling between their mobile phone and the mounting  is exceptional ly unlikely  to 
have  withstood the collision force s, so no conclusion can be made from the  mobile 
phone  being found outside the truck ’s cab.  
 The truck driver being engaged in a mobile phone call does not itself explain why their 
visual attention was not on the truck’s surrounding s, but still likely  contri buted to their 
overall level of distraction  and lack of situational awareness . 
 The position of the sun in relation to the truck driver’s field of vision would have 
increased the difficulty  for them to see the approach ing train.  However , as established 
above, it is very unlikely  that the truck driver’s visual focus was towards the 
approaching train. Sun -strike24 itself is therefore judged very unlikely  to have 
significantly contribut ed to this accident , but may have further limit ed the peripheral 
vision  cues available to the truck driver .

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 Mulcocks Road LCSIA  report and action taken  
Safety issue: SFAIRP assessments were not being routinely carried out for risk treatments 
recommended in LCSIA reports . No process , and minimal guidance , on SFAIRP asse ssment for 
level crossing risk treatments was available  in industry documents.  
Crossing closure  
 The LCSIA report’s recommended ‘Criterion  1’ risk treatment , closure  of Mulcocks Road 
level crossing, would virtually certain ly have prevented this accident . 
 The LCSIA process requires ‘Criterion 1’  risk treatments be given first considera tion. Its 
guidance document ation  provides  a flowchart , an excerpt of which is  shown in Figure 8 
below . The path overlaid in green  show s the process  that crossing closure should have 
followed,  arriving at ’Is treatment  suitable given constraints? ’ This step represents a 
joint SFAIRP assessment  between KiwiRail and the Council .

 Neither the Council nor KiwiRail could provide a  documented SFAIRP assessment  for 
the LCSIA report’s recommendation to close  Mulcocks Road level crossing. Such an 
assessment  – if it had occurred – may legitimately have concluded crossing closure as 
being not reasonably practicable , but this was not formally conducted or documented.  
 
‘Criterion 1’ met  Crossing closure  
 
Final Report RO -2020 -101 |  
<< Page 15 >>
 Instal lation of half -arm barriers  
 Amongst the LCSIA report’s recommended ‘Criterion  2’ risk treatments  was th e 
installation of half-arm barriers , which would very likely  have prevented this accident  
either by:  
• the truck driver  becoming alert  to the truck’s movement , by sound or feel,  when it 
struck the barrier arm  
• the barrier arm p hysically preventing the truck from crawling forwards . 
 The LCSIA process requires ‘Criterion 2’ risk treatments be considered if ‘Criterion 1’ is 
not reasonably practicable.  Figure 9 again  shows the  guidance documentation  
flowchart , but with the path overlaid in green representing consideration of half -arm 
barrier s if crossing closure was determin ed to not be reasonably practica ble. Again,  this 
arrives at  a joint SFAIRP assessment  between the Council and KiwiRail .

 As with  crossing  closure, no documented  SFAIRP  assess ment for the installation of 
half-arm barriers could be provided by the Council or KiwiRail . Such an assessment – if 
it had occurred – may have legitimately  concluded half -arm barriers to not be 
reasonably practicable, but this was not formal ly conducted or documented.  
 Import antly , issues of short -stacking  at Mulcocks Road level crossing  would not have  
been  addressed  by half -arm barriers . Short -stacking was a significant factor in the 
estimated risk for the level crossing , so despite  not contr ibuting to this accident  this

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 decreas es the likelihood that half-arm bar riers would have  been found practicable  in a 
SFAIRP assessment . 
Other recommended risk treatments  
 Other ‘Criterion  2’ risk treatments recommended in the LCSIA report (see 2.47 for full 
list) are very unlikely  to have prevented this accident. These treatments were 
predominantly aime d at unfamiliar road users recognising the level crossing, or at 
cyclists using the new cycleway.  
 As with crossing closure and half -arm barriers, n o documented SFAIRP assessment 
could be provided by the Council or KiwiRail for the se other  recommended risk 
treatments.  
Formal SFAIRP assessment  
 KiwiRail responded to the Commission’s questions  on SFAIRP assessment for LCSIA 
recommendations, stating that no formal policy or process existed at the time 
Mulcocks Road level crossing ’s LCSIA report was published  or at the time of the  
accident.  
 Recommend ed risk treatments  made  in LCSIA reports  for other level crossings 
throughout New  Zealand have  similarly not been formally SFAIRP -assessed , although 
many have been implemented . 
 Amongst other documents  available to industry  there are references to  SFAIRP  
assessment for identified level crossing risk treatments. Included in these is  Waka 
Kotahi ’s Traffic control devices manual  (TCDM ) Part 9  for level crossings . However , no 
process or guidance on how to un dertake a  SFAIRP assessment  for level crossings is 
provided in these documents . 
Context for  Mulcocks Road  level crossing  LCSIA  
Safe ty issue: Level crossing safety scores (LCSS) have little influenc e on the prioritisation  of 
level crossing upgrades . 
 The Commission has undertaken a review of other available LCSIA reports to gain 
perspective on Mulcocks Road level crossing’s ‘updated existing’ LCSS value of 43/60  
relative to others throughout New  Zealand.  
 Around 200 LCSIAs25 were made available to the Commission by KiwiRail, who review 
and approve all reports before they are published . Of these, 70 were  selected as 
suitable for comparison with Mulcocks Road  level crossing . These are presented in 
Appendix 2 , along with the rationale for their selection . 
 LCSS values  were taken from  these  comparable  LCSIAs and adjusted to reflect the most 
up-to-date methodology for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values ( Appendix 2 
details th ese adjustment s). This aimed to achieve as close to a like-for-like comparison 
as possible.   
 
25 LCSIAs in this context are determined as a set of LCSS scores and recommendations for an individual road or 
pedestrian crossing. In many cases , a single LCSIA report will  include several LCSIAs for either different level 
crossings or separate roadway/pedestrian crossings at the same location . 
 
Final Report RO -2020 -101 |  
<< Page 17 >>
 
 Adjusted LCSS  values were com pared across all 70 selected  LCSIAs. The overall 
distribution – and Mulcocks Road level crossing’s position within it  – are presented in  
Figure 10 below , along with LCSIA risk bands .26 
   
Figure 10: LCSS distribution for comparable LCSIAs  
 This puts Mulcocks Road level crossing  in the 94th percentile , or fifth-ranked overall, for 
LCSIA -estimated  risk amongst this sample group . 
 This position demonstrates how Mulcocks Road  level crossing , despite its ALCAM risk 
score and being  outside KiwiRail’s ‘Top 200’ ALCAM list, was identified  by the LCSIA 
process  as comparatively  high risk. 
 Even if Mulcocks Road l evel crossing had been assessed at its maximum possible  
‘updated existing’  LCSS of 55/60 ,27 this would not have affected the  risk treatments  
recommended  in its LCSIA  or their evaluation against ‘Criteria 1 and 2’ . Crossing  
closure would still have been the ‘Criterion  1’ recommended  risk treatment  and half -
arm barriers  etc would still have satisfied  ‘Criterion  2’. 
 It is then also very unlikely  that an L CSS of 55/60 would have influenced the  Council 
and KiwiRail’s  informal SF AIRP assessments . The Council’s assessment of crossing 
closure  impracticability did not take account of raw LCSS value s, and Mulcocks Road 
level crossing’s position outside KiwiRail’s ‘Top 200’ ALCAM  list was the predominating 
factor in  half-arm barriers being assessed as not practicable.  
 
26 These risk bands classify risk based on LCSS intervals of 10. See Appendix 1  for further explanation.  
27 Based on 25/30 for Mulcocks Road level crossing’s ALCAM risk s core of 24.1 and then 10/10 for each of the 
three other risk -estimation components. Appendix 1  explains the composition of LCSS values.  024681012

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 Regular risk review LCSIAs  
Safet y issue: Selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs , and often upgrade,  is 
not being  effectively prioritise d towards  those with greatest estimated  risk. 
 Level crossing safety assessment and upgrade  should be prioritis ed to select level 
crossings with the greatest  associated risk. This is especially  true where available 
funding and resources  for upgrades  is constrained . 
 Prioritised selection of level crossings was not a contributing factor in this accident. 
Mulcocks Road level crossing underwent its LCSIA due to a ‘change in use’ (the 
construction of the cycleway) and other  risk indicators, such as its ALCAM  risk score,  
did not identi fy it as  especially high risk . 
 ‘Regular risk review ’ LCSIAs are those carried out to assess existing risk  of a level 
crossing . This is where the opportunity exists to selectively priori tise level crossing s for 
detailed risk estimation  under the LCSIA proce ss, rather than the essentially random 
selection for ‘ change in use ’. 
 The Commissi on’s review of comparable LCSIAs identified 20 of the 70 as being 
undertaken for ‘regular risk review ’. The remainder were  all ‘change in use’ . 
 Figure 11 below  shows the ALCAM fatal return period28 against  the adjusted  ‘updated 
existing’ LCSS for these 20 ‘ regular risk review ’ LCSIAs.  In each case the ALCAM data 
was known prior to the LCSIA being undertaken, while  the LCSS  was only known 
afterwards . Mulcocks Road level crossing ’s LCSIA , undertaken for ‘change in use’, is 
also included for its context.  
 
Figure 11: LCSIAs undertaken for regular risk review  
(and Mulcocks Road level crossing) , by ALCAM  fatal  return period  
 Figure 11 indicates where  selection for  ‘regular risk review ’ LCSIAs  has not be en 
effectively prioritised by ALCAM data. 45 per cent  are outside of ALCAM’s ‘high risk’ 
band and 55 per  cent have a longer ALCAM fatal re turn period  than Mulcocks Road  
 
28 The fatal return period is ALCAM’s estimated number of years between equivalent fatalities (see footnote 16). It 
is the inverse of the ALCAM risk score (see Appendix 1  for further explanation).  Alabama Rd

 level crossing . A rigorous ALCAM -based prioritisation would instead show  data points 
tightly grouped towards the left side of the ‘high risk’ ba nd. 
 Any alternative prioritisation could be demonstra ted as effective by its resultant LCSS 
values. That is, undertaking LCSIAs  – and upgrades  – for level crossings with low 
ALCAM risk scores could be justified if the  LCSIA process then identified the se as being  
high risk. With some exceptions, most notabl y Norman Avenue, this is not apparent in 
Figure 11. 
 In the example  of SH27 Waitoa, which was upgrade d to half -arm barriers, the LCSIA 
process in fact found th is level  crossing in its existing state  to meet ‘Criteria 1’ and 
therefore to be a ‘broadly acceptable risk’ .29 This demonstrates where level crossing 
upgrade resources are being consumed by a level crossing with low relative risk.  
 The selection rationale for ‘ regular risk review ’ LCSIAs, and indeed upgrades in many 
cases, was not clearly stated in most reports.  Instead , many30 simply included ’KiwiRail 
are planning to construct half -arm barriers… ’ or similar statements , with no elaboration 
on why a  particular  level crossing had been selected.  
 Equally, several level crossings in the Wairarapa region31 were grouped into one report 
for their geographical proximity. No upgrade proposals were in place at this time, and 
instead the report was aimed at scoping suitab le proposals. This approach will have 
benefited from a lower per -level crossing cost to conduct LCSIAs.  
 In the broad er context , New Zealand’s  greatest ALCAM risk score was 218 ,32 equat ing 
to a 46 -year fatal return period.  The greatest ALCAM risk score a mongst the 20 ‘regular 
risk review ’ LCSIAs was  only 59.0 for SH93 Bridge Street  (equating to  a 169 -year fatal 
return period ). 
 Figure 12 below  shows this shortfall between level crossings with the greatest ALCAM 
risk scores and those that have been selected for ‘regular risk review’ LCSIAs.  
 
29 Where a risk is judged as low enough to not warrant consideration of further reduction or mitigation. Not 
generally considered a fixed threshold, it differs between different industries and activities, and shifts with 
changes in societal attitudes towards  risk. S ee Appendix 2 for further explanation of this concept.

Figure 13: ALCAM risk score to L CSS conversion table, ambiguity highlighted  
(Credit: Table 0 -11 of Level crossing risk assessment guidance version 3, Waka Kotahi/KiwiRail)  
 Ambiguity arises because the overlap in ‘ALCAM Risk Score’  ranges  ’19-20’ and ’20-40’ 
is 19.5 – 20.49, and the ‘Threshold’ value of 20.6 is outside of this overlap.  
 For example, an ALCAM risk score of 20.55  would be outside the ’19 -20’ range , but still 
below the 20.6 threshold, making it unclear whether to assig n an LCSS of 24/30 or 
25/30. 
 ‘ALCAM Risk Score’ ranges  of ‘19 -21’ and ’21 -40’ would  shift the overl ap and remove 
this ambiguity . 
 This is expected to have had negligible impact on LCSIAs completed to date , but has 
the potential to produce misleading LCSS values in future.

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 4 Findings  
 The flashing lights and bells at Mulcocks  Road level crossing were virtually certain  to 
have been active and operating correctly at the time of the accident.   
 It is very likely the truck driver recognised the active flashing lights and bells and 
intended to stop short of the level crossing until after the train had passed.  
 The truck moved forward onto the level crossing and into the path of the train, very 
likely  due to the  truck  driver not keep ing enough  pressure on the brake pedal of the 
automatic transmission truck.  
 The truck dri ver was very likely  unaware of the truck’s forward movement . Instead , 
their visual attention  was focused  downwards  on some  undetermined  distractio n 
within the truck ’s cab, and their peripheral vi ew of the truck’s surroundings  was limited . 
 It was not possib le for the train driver to stop or significantly slow the train in the brief 
time, estimated to be less than  5 seconds , between them first realising that the truck 
was entering the level crossing and the collision occurring.  
 In response to Mulcocks  Road ’s LCSIA report , no formal SFAIRP assessment was 
undertaken  for recommended risk treatments to decide  betwee n implement ation  of a 
recommendation (s) or accept ance of  the risk as  being  tolerable.  
 SFAIRP assessments were not being routinely carried out f or risk treatments 
recommended in LCSIA reports. No documented process, and minimal guidance, on 
SFAIRP assessment for level crossing risk treatments was available in industry 
documents.  
 LCSS s have little influence on the prioritisation of level crossing u pgrades.  
 Selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs , and indeed  upgrade  in many 
cases , is not being  effectively prioritised towards those representing the greatest risk.  
 The guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values is ambiguous for 
ALCAM risk scores in the 20.0 – 20.6 range.

 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
General  
 Safety issues are an output from the Commission’s analysis. They typically describe a 
syste m problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.  
 Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Routine SFAIRP asses sment  
 Rail participants are required by the Railways Act 2005 to ensure  – so far as is 
reasonably practicable  – their activities do not cause, or are not likely to cause, death 
or serious injury to individuals . 
 Financial constraints, among st other challen ges, mean that not all risk treatments 
recommended in LCSIA reports are indeed reasonably practicabl e. It is important 
however that  an assessment of practicability is methodically conducted  so that risk 
treatments are not discounted without first being duly considered.  
 KiwiRail has taken the following safety action s to address this issue . 
• Started , since this accident , to carry out documented SFAIRP assessments for LCSIA 
recommended risk treatments. The Commission were provided with two of these 
assessments .34 35 
• Commenced formalising a SFAIRP policy and creating a documented process for how 
to SFAIRP -assess recommended level crossing risk treatments. This is intended to be 
separate from, but complementary to, the LC SIA guidance  document.  
 SFAIRP assessments complete d to date  are noted to use  ALCAM fatal return periods  
for deriving the safety benefit  value36 of risk treatments . The LCSIA process, and  its 
LCSS values , does not influence  this assess ment of  safety benefit  value . This approach 
therefore excludes the wider factors of engineering judgement, incident history and 
local knowledge that ALCAM’s overseeing committee recommend are considered in 
deciding risk treatments  (National ALCAM Committee , 2016, p. 18) . This same guidance 
is also provided for level crossing  risk management  in the United Kingdom  (Office of 
Rail & Road, 2021, pp. 12 -13). 
 The Commission welcomes the safety action to  date. However, it believes more action 
needs to be taken to ensure the safety of future operations. Therefore, the Commission 
has made a recommendation in section 6 to address this issue.

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 LCSIA  influence on level crossing upgrade s 
 For effective risk mitigation at level crossings , it is essential the most comp rehensive  
risk estimates are used to support decision -making around level crossing upgrades.  
 The LCSIA process  is relatively new  and was devised with the aim of addressing  known 
shortcomings  that arise  when  ALCAM  is applied in isolation , by recogni sing 
engineering experien ce and judgement, crash and incident history, and local 
knowledge . Its intention is to provide a more comp rehensive  estimation of level 
crossing risk  than what  ALCAM  is capable of alone . 
 Despite this, ALCAM risk scores (and particular ly the  ALCAM ‘Top  200’ list ) persist as  
the overriding  influence in  whether  level crossing upgrades  proceed  or not . Mulcocks 
Road level crossing  not being duly considered for  half-arm barrier  upgrade  is an 
example  of this . 
 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation in section 6 to address this issue.  
Selection of level crossings for regular risk review  
 With finite funding and resources available for level crossing upgrades, it is essential 
for future safety that level crossings with the greatest  estimated  risk are prioritised.  
 The Commission found that level crossings selected for detailed risk assessment in  
‘regular risk review’ LCSIAs, and indeed upgrade  in many cases , were  not being 
effectively prioritised  by their known  estimated risk (ALCAM risk scores or other 
sources) . 
 KiwiRail advised the Commission  that they inten d to undertak e LCSIAs across  a group 
of level crossings in ALCAM’s  ‘Top 200’  to determine  a priority order for safety 
treatments . This will then inform KiwiRail’s funding submission for the 2024 -27 
National Land Transport P rogramme . 
 The Commission  welcomes  KiwiRail’s  intended  safety action , recognising the 
improvement an evidence -based approach will make in the prioritisation  of funding of 
level crossing safety upgrades. However , it believes this needs to be fully embedded in 
long-term action s and to include Waka Kotahi  as a key funding partner . Therefor e, the 
Commission  has made a recommendation in section 6 to address this issue.  
Other safety action s 
 Participants may take safety actions to address issues that woul d not normally result in 
the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
 The following safety action  has been taken:  
• The Council and KiwiRail have committed to a SFAIRP assessment for Mulcocks 
Road level crossing in the financial year 2021/2022. The Council have stated this 
may include a trial closure of the level crossing.

 6 Recommendations   
General   
 The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents.  
 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future . 
New recommendations   
 On 8 December 2021, the Commission recommended that KiwiRail , in the 
development of a formal SFAIRP policy, consider incorporati ng wider  factors of 
engineering judgement, incident history and local knowledge . (011/21)  
On 2 February 2022, KiwiRail replied:  
KiwiRail accepts this recommendation. We are in the process of finalising the SFAIRP policy. 
As part of this process we will be incorpor ating wider factors of engineering judgement, 
incident history from the ORA system and local knowledge. KiwiRail expects this to be 
implemented in the first half of 2022 and will provide further information when this is 
completed.  
 
 On 8 December 2021, the Commission recommended that KiwiRail  and Waka 
Kotahi NZ Transport Agency  examine how the selection of level crossings for 
LCSIAs and upgrade can be more accurately prioritised from ALCAM  risk scores  
and other existing data sources.  (012/21)  
On 2 February 2022, KiwiRail replied:  
KiwiRail accepts this recommendation. The original top 200 list is almost depleted of crossings 
that have not had an LCSIA. We will work in conjunction with Waka Kotahi to develop the next 
top 200 at risk crossings and ens ure they are accurately prioritised from ALCAM risk scores 
and other existing data sources.  
 
On 4 February 2022, Waka Kotahi replied:  
Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency has reviewed the findings and supports the 
recommendation to examine how the selection of level crossings for LCSIAs and upgrade can 
be more accurately prioritised from ALCAM risk scores and other existing data sources.  
 
It should be noted that Waka Kotahi can only accept this recommendation for level crossings 
that are positioned on state hig hways. Crossings located on local roads will need to be 
discussed by KiwiRail and the responsible Road Controlling Authority.

 Appendix 1  Level crossing  risk manage ment  in 
New  Zealand  
Level crossing risk  
The typically high masses and long stopping distances  associated with trains and other rail 
vehicles  mean that level crossing collisions  have serious  ramifications , and that their 
avoidance is heavily reliant on  the road traffic and pedestrians using  a level crossing.  
This, combined with level cross ing collisions  being relatively low likelihood events , create s 
challenges both in the assessment of risk for individual level crossings  and in the 
optimi sation of  overall  risk reduction with available resources.  
Level crossing s, and the risk they pose,  can be eliminated by grade separation .37 However,  
this is typically expensive to undertake and in some cases is impracticable due to physical 
constraints  (adjacent landowners and infrastructure etc) . 
Closure of level crossings similarly eliminates th eir risk, but is also impracticable in many 
cases because of the need for people, vehicles and livestock to cross railway s.  
Level crossings consequently remain a feature of New  Zealand’s rail network and  of many 
others throughout the world.  
Accepting the existence of level crossings, their available risk controls then fall into two 
categories . 
• Active protection – where the approach of rail vehicles automatically activates 
warning devices, such as flashing lights and bells, or deploys physical barriers . 
• Passive protection – warns users of a level crossing’s presence  by signage and other 
means , but does not react to approaching rail vehicles , and instead  relies on level 
crossing users to check for trains before traversing . 
Active protection provides greater r isk mitigation than passive protection but  has greater 
associated cost.  Level crossings with greater traffic volumes, poor sighting distances38 or 
other risk -increasing factors  are more likely to have active protection systems . 
So far as is reasonably practicable  
The Railways Act 2005 requires rail participants to ensure that, ‘so far as is reasonably 
possible ’ (SFAIRP) , its activities do not cause the death of, or serious injur y to, individuals.  
A similar concept to managing risk SFAIRP is reducing risk to ‘as low as reasonably possible ’ 
(ALARP). The ALARP principle has its origins in United Kingdom health and safety law , but is 
in widespread use throughout numerous industries a nd countries.   
The ‘ALARP Triangle ’ is a visual model that explains the principle . The figure  below shows it 
as it is included in New  Zealand’s NRSS/4 .39 
 
37 To isolate roa d and rail traffic from one another by the construction of  a bridge or tunnel/underpass.  
38 The distance from a level crossing where an approaching train becomes visible. It may be limited by factors 
such as obstructions or track curvature.

ALARP Triangle  
(Credit: National Rail System Standard 4  – Risk Management ) 
The ‘Intolerable region’ in the ALARP Triangle is where a risk is  judged  too great to be 
accepted. In the context of level crossing s this is where collision risk is assessed as being too 
great for a level crossing to remain open . 
The ‘ALARP or Tolerable R egion’ indicates where a risk must be assessed against the 
availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise risk ( viable solutions ), and  the 
proportionality of associated costs ( cost of viable solutions ). For a level crossing this  means  
identif ying available  protections, and then weighing th e benefit  of these protections  against  
the cost and resources required to implement the m. Protections can then be assessed as not 
reasonably practicable  if cost and resources outweigh the benefit.  Often organisations will 
apply some factor to this weighing, such as the cost and resources needing to exceed twice 
(or some other multiple) the est imated benefit.  
The ‘Broadly acceptable region’ is where the associated risk is below a threshold level that no 
further weighing of cost -benefit for further protection is necessary.  
Some debate exists on the interchangeability of SFAIRP and ALARP  in risk management.  
Commonly ,40 the distinction made between the two is that the SFAIRP concept does not 
have a ‘Broadly acceptable region’, and that weighing of cost -benefit should be undertaken 
for all viable solutions irrespective of the risk level. For the pur poses of this report, both are 
considered interchangeable and the ‘Broadly acceptable region’ is considered to exist.  
Level crossing risk assessment tools  in New  Zealand  
Australian level crossings assessment model ( ALCAM )

throughout Australia in 2003.

 KiwiRail and Waka Kotahi  undertook  an extensive  survey  to collect ALCAM data  for public 
level crossings in 2008 -2012 . It has since become an embedded part of New  Zealand’s 
management of level crossing risk .  
ALCAM applies separate models for roadway crossings and pedestrian crossings.  
ALCAM scor es roadway  level crossings for safety risk according to an extensive range of 
factors , includ ing level crossing character istics, visibility,  controls  and protections , volumes 
and types of road/ pedestrian/ rail traffic , train and road vehicle speeds, and nearby rail and 
roading infrastructure .  
ALCAM computes a risk score for roadway level crossings that is equivalent to the es timated 
annual probability of one equivalent fatality occurring , expressed as a decimal . ALCAM risk 
scores can be up to 16 decimal places, and so  common reporting practice is to multiply  them  
by 10,000 and then round to  either  a whole number  or 1 decimal p lace. 
The inverse of the ALCAM risk score can be used to express the estimated number of years 
between  equivalent  fatalities . This is  termed the ‘fatal return rate ’. 
ALCAM risk scores are available for all level crossings throughout New  Zealand . However , 
there is an  ongoing , resource -intensive  need to maintain input data (average user volumes 
etc) meaning th at the up-to-datedness of these risk scores can vary significantly .  
ALCAM categorises level crossings into five risk bands41 based upon their risk score relative 
to all others within the same jurisdiction ,42 with each band always containing 20  per cent  of a 
jurisdiction’s level crossings. This even distribution means that the thresholds between bands 
shift over time as risk scores amongst a juri sdiction’s level crossings evolve.  
A global risk banding is also available in ALCAM, which uses the combined data of all 
jurisdictions’ level crossings. However , this has limited applications within level crossing risk 
management in New  Zealand.  
While ALCA M is a comprehensive tool  for assessing level crossing risk , its overseeing 
committee  acknowledge it is unsuitable for isolated application . It is not able to fully account 
for factors such as local knowledge, incident history and engineering judgement , and so 
instead it is only intended for use in support of wider decision -making processes .  
Importantly , ALCAM does not attempt to set a  risk threshold for mandated  level crossing 
upgrade . Nor does it attempt to define a threshold for a ‘safe’ , or acceptable , level of level 
crossing risk. That is,  it does not define a boundary between the ‘Intolerable’ , ‘ALARP or 
Tolerable’  and the ‘Broadly acceptable’  regions depicted in the ALARP Triangle . 
Instead, ALCAM leaves these decision s for each jurisdi ction’s risk owners . This depend s on 
wider considerations such as  the level of risk at other level crossings within a jurisdiction, 
what risk levels  owners are prepared to tolerate , and the availability of funding and resources 
for risk  reduction.  
Level Crossing Safety Impact Assessment ( LCSIA ) 
To further support decision -making , a Level Crossing Risk Assessment Guidance (LCRAG) 
document was developed for KiwiRail and Waka Kotahi . It was first published in July 2017 
and has since been updated in October 2 018, November 2020 and March 2021.  
 
41 High, medium -high, medium, medium -low and low.  
42 ALCAM jurisdictions group level crossings by the entities responsible for their associated risk. New  Zealand is 
its own jurisdiction within ALCAM, as typically are Australian states and territories.  
 

<< Page 36 >>
 Final Report RO-2020 -101 The document  defines the methodology for conducting a Level Crossing Safety Impact 
Assessment (LCSIA) and details how to calculate a Level Crossing Safety Score (LCSS).  
The LCSS value is an out-of-60 score that represents the estimated risk for a level crossing. It 
incorporates a converted ALCAM  risk score (30 available points) , but also considers three 
wider factors , each comprising  10 available points .  
• Crash and incident history . 
• Site survey observations . 
• An engineers’ assessment (combined train driver and roading engineer) . 
LCSS values are then used to classify level crossings into five risk bands , as shown below .  
 
LCSS risk bands  
(Credit: Figure 4 -1 of Level Crossing Risk Assessment Guidance version 3, Waka Kotahi/KiwiRail ) 
LCSS risk bands differ significantly from ALCAM risk bands. The boundaries are fixed at 
10-point intervals and there is no forced distribution applied (like in ALCAM’s approach to fit  
20 per cent  of level crossings within each band).  This means , for example,  a level crossing  
may have a ‘ medium’ ALCAM risk  banding , but a ‘medium -high’ LCSS risk banding . 
LCSIA s must be undertaken for all new level crossings and for  ‘change in use’ of existing level 
crossings. A change in use is anything with the potential to materially affect a crossing’s risk 
profile , including changes to the level crossing design , to nearby infrastructure or  in user 
volumes (road, pedestrian and rail). It is the respons ibility of the change ’s proposer to have 
the LCSIA undertaken by a KiwiRail -accredited LCSIA assessor.  
For a typical LCSIA, some or all the following stages will have an LCSS value calculated . 
• ‘Updated Existing ’ – risk for a level  crossing as it currently exists, accounting for 
current -day user volumes . 
• ‘Change in Use ’ – risk for the level crossing if a given change (eg , new cycleway 
constructed adjacent) is made in its as -proposed state . 

 
Final Report RO -2020 -101 |  
<< Page 37 >>
 • ‘Proposed Design ’ – risk for a crossing wit h the change made and at -grade risk 
treatments43 applied as recommended by the safety review team (eg , installing 
flashing lights and bell s, improvements to warning signage etc) . 
• ‘Future Score ’ – risk for the crossing under the ‘Proposed Design ’, but accou nting for 
expected user volume increase over a period of 10 years . 
The LCSIA then has two criteria for a level crossing’s design or upgrade . 
• ‘Criterion 1 ’ – the ‘Proposed Design ’ and ‘Future Score ’ are brought within low or 
medium -low LCSS risk bands (LCSS  is 29 or less) . 
• ‘Criterion 2 ’ – the ‘Proposed Design ’ and ‘Future Score ’ achieve an LCSS less than or 
equal to the ‘Updated Existing ’ value . 
‘Criterion 1 ’ is the effective equivalent of the ‘Broadly acceptable  region ’ in the ALARP 
Triangle and  is the LCSIA methodology concluding a risk warrants no further mitigation. This 
is a mandatory requirement for new level crossings.  
For existing level crossings undergoing a change , ‘Criterion 1 ’ is preferred , but does not need 
to be met if the solution c an be demonstrated as exceeding SFAIRP limits  (cost or other 
constraints) . This is equivalent to the ‘ALARP or Tolerable Region ’ in the ALARP Triangle . 
Similarly, individual  ‘Criterion 2’  risk treatment recommendations (potential upgrades) 
identified in an  LCSIA do not have to be applied if it can be demonstrated they exceed 
SFAIRP  limits . ‘Criterion 2 ’ must however still be met  overall , or the change must not 
proceed.  
The effect of these two criteria and the LCSIA process overall mean that:  
• new level cross ings must not exceed  ‘broadly acceptable ’ risk  
• changes to existing level crossings must not increase risk beyond its existing level  
• changes to existing level crossings must reduce risk to ‘broadly acceptable ’ levels, 
unless it can be demonstrated this is not reasonably practicable . 
The LCSIA process is also used to assess  existing level crossings  not undergoing a change in 
use. These assessments generally aim to  better understand existing level crossing risk on 
New Zealand’s railway network or to inform design f or proposed  level crossing upgrades.  As 
with ‘change in use’ assessments , ‘Criterion 1’ is preferred but not mandated  for these . 
 
43 Refers to ri sk mitigation measures that can be applied to a level crossing while the roadway and railway remain 
at the same level. Contrasts with grade separation, where a railway crossing ceases to be a level crossing, and 
with closure where it ceases being a railway  crossing.

 Final Report RO-2020 -101 Appendix 2  Summary of reviewed LCSIAs  
The following table lists the LCSIAs that were selected as comparable to Mulcocks Road level crossing for the Commission’s re view.  
Selection was based on roadway level crossings for public roads, or private roads with significant road vehic le volumes. Private level crossings with low 
user volumes were not included.  
In a small number of instances two separate LCSIAs are available for a single level crossing, indicating that it has been ass essed twice. In these cases, 
both LCSIAs are included and are denoted in the ‘Crossing name’ column by their assessment year.  
Early LCSIAs, where LCSS values were not explicitly calculated, were excluded because no numerical comparison could be made.  
‘Change in use’ LCSS values were extracted from each LCSIA,  or where these were not available ‘Updated Existing’ LCSS values were extracted instead. 
This ensured the greater LCSS values from each LCSIA were used and there was a fair comparison to Mulcocks Road level crossing’s ‘Updated Existing’ 
value (but is repr esentative of ‘Change in use’ because the LCSIA was conducted after the construction of an adjacent cycleway).  
LCSIAs conducted before, and for a short crossover period following, the publication of Level Crossing Risk Assessment Guidance ( LCRAG ) v1 in Ju ly 
2017 used a more basic methodology for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS ALCAM Component values. This was based solely on ALCAM risk 
bands and meant all values were in increments of six. This difference in methodologies limits the comparability of LC SIAs, and so LCSS values for all 
LCSIAs have been adjusted according to the  LCRAG v3 methodology.

 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ng āti 
Raukawa, Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or 
vessel for seeking knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 
‘waka whai mārama’ (i te ara haumaru) is ‘a vessel/vehicle in pur suit of understanding’. Waka is a 
metaphor for the Commission. Mārama (from ‘te ao mārama’ – the world of light) is for the separation 
of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, 
forests and everything dwe lling within), which brought light and thus awareness to the world. ‘Te ara’ 
is ‘the path’ and ‘haumaru’ is ‘safe’ or ‘risk free’.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the 
mother and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three 
kete of knowledge that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom 
to humanity. The continual wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represents 
the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā h au e whā - the four winds  
To Sandy, ‘Ngā hau e whā ’ (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people 
coming together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design 
represents the sky, cloud, and wind. The re is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move 
through Aotearoa’s ‘long white cloud’. The letter ‘A’ is present, standing for a ‘Aviation’.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this 
Kōwha iwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different ‘ara wai’ (waterways) 
that ships sail across. The ‘V’ shape is a ship’s prow and its wake. The letter ‘M’ is present, standing for 
‘Maritim e.  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. ‘Rere’ is to flow or fly. ‘Whenua’ 
is the land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The 
letter ‘R’ is present, standing for ‘Rail’.  
Sandy  acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and 
everything that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
