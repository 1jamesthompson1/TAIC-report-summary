- name: Distracted Driving
  explanation: "Distracted driving is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the truck driver's attention was diverted from the truck's surroundings to an undetermined distraction within the truck's cab. The Commission's analysis suggests that the truck driver was likely aware of the active level crossing signals, as evidenced by the truck slowing down significantly before reaching the level crossing, indicating an intention to stop (\"Separate independent accounts from the witness and the train driver observed the truck slowing significantly before it reached the level crossing\" (12)). However, the driver's failure to maintain sufficient pressure on the brake pedal and the witness' observation of the driver looking down and reaching into the passenger side area suggest that the driver was distracted and unaware of the truck's forward movement (\"The truck\u2019s slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the lead-up to the collision was very likely due to its driver not applying sufficient pressure to the brake pedal\" (12), \"It is very likely the truck driver\u2019s peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted\" (12)).\n"
- name: Inadequate Risk Assessment and Management for Level Crossings
  explanation: "Inadequate risk assessment and management for level crossings is a safety theme that is central to this accident. The LCSIA report's recommended risk treatments, such as the closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing or the installation of half-arm barriers, were not formally assessed for their practicability using the SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) principle. No documented SFAIRP assessments were provided by the Council or KiwiRail for the recommended risk treatments, which could have prevented the accident if implemented (\"Neither the Council nor KiwiRail could provide a documented SFAIRP assessment for the LCSIA report\u2019s recommendation to close Mulcocks Road level crossing\" (14), \"As with crossing closure, no documented SFAIRP assessment could be provided by the Council or KiwiRail for the installation of half-arm barriers\" (15)).\n"
- name: Insufficient Use of Mobile Phones While Driving Legislation
  explanation: "The insufficient use of mobile phones while driving legislation is a safety theme in this accident. Although New Zealand law prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving, the Commission was unable to determine if the truck driver was using the hands-free mounting at the time of the accident. The mobile phone being found outside the truck's cab after the collision does not provide conclusive evidence due to the forces involved in the collision. The driver's engagement in a mobile phone call, while not explaining the lack of visual attention, likely contributed to their overall level of distraction and lack of situational awareness (\"The Commission was unable to determine if the truck driver was utilising the hands-free mounting fitted to the truck dashboard at the time of the accident\" (13), \"The truck driver being engaged in a mobile phone call does not itself explain why their visual attention was not on the truck\u2019s surroundings, but still likely contributed to their overall level of distraction\" (13)).\n"
- name: Ineffective Prioritization of Level Crossing Upgrades
  explanation: "Ineffective prioritization of level crossing upgrades is a safety theme that emerges from the analysis of this accident. The selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs and subsequent upgrades is not effectively prioritized towards those representing the greatest risk. The Commission's review indicated that many level crossings with lower ALCAM risk scores were selected for upgrades over those with higher scores, demonstrating a misalignment between estimated risk and prioritization for upgrades (\"Selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs, and indeed upgrade in many cases, is not being effectively prioritised towards those representing the greatest risk\" (18), \"Figure 11 indicates where selection for \u2018regular risk review\u2019 LCSIAs has not been effectively prioritised by ALCAM data\" (18)).\n"
- name: Lack of Situational Awareness
  explanation: "Lack of situational awareness is a safety theme related to this accident, as the truck driver's attention was not focused on the truck's surroundings, which included the approaching train. The position of the sun may have further limited the peripheral vision cues available to the truck driver, although sun-strike itself was judged very unlikely to have significantly contributed to the accident. The driver's lack of situational awareness was a critical factor in the truck moving onto the level crossing and into the path of the train (\"It is very likely the truck driver\u2019s peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted\" (12), \"Sun-strike itself is therefore judged very unlikely to have significantly contributed to this accident, but may have further limited the peripheral vision cues available to the truck driver\" (13)).\n"
- name: Ambiguity in Risk Assessment Guidance
  explanation: "Ambiguity in risk assessment guidance is a safety theme that, while not directly contributing to the accident, represents a systemic issue in the assessment of level crossing risks. The guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values is ambiguous for scores in the 20.0 \u2013 20.6 range, which could lead to misleading LCSS values in future assessments. This ambiguity could affect the prioritization and decision-making process for level crossing upgrades and risk treatments (\"The guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values is ambiguous for ALCAM risk scores in the 20.0 \u2013 20.6 range\" (20))."
