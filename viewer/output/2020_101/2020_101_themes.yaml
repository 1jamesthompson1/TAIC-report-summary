- name: Distracted Driving
  explanation: Distracted driving is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the truck driver's attention was diverted from the truck's surroundings, leading to the vehicle's slow forward crawl onto the level crossing. The Commission's analysis suggests that the driver was likely aware of the active warning signals but became distracted by an undetermined source within the truck's cab, causing them not to maintain sufficient pressure on the brake pedal. "the truck's slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the lead-up to the collision was very likely due to its driver not applying sufficient pressure to the brake pedal" (12.4 (invalid formatted quote)). Additionally, the driver's peripheral vision was likely restricted, preventing them from detecting the truck's subtle forward movement, which further supports distracted driving as a significant safety theme in this incident. "it is very likely that the truck driver's peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted" (12.5 (invalid formatted quote)).
- name: Inadequate Risk Assessment and Management for Level Crossings
  explanation: Inadequate risk assessment and management for level crossings is another safety theme, as the accident occurred at a level crossing that had undergone assessment under the LCSIA process, but no formal SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) assessment was conducted for the recommended risk treatments. "in response to mulcocks road's lcsia report, no formal sfairp assessment was undertaken for recommended risk treatments" (22.6 (invalid formatted quote)). This indicates a systemic issue with how risks at level crossings are evaluated and managed, which is characteristic of an organizational or systemic influence on safety.
- name: Lack of Effective Prioritization for Level Crossing Upgrades
  explanation: The lack of effective prioritization for level crossing upgrades is a safety theme that emerges from the report, as it was found that the selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs and upgrades is not effectively prioritized towards those representing the greatest risk. "selection of level crossings for regular risk review lcsias, and indeed upgrade in many cases, is not being effectively prioritised towards those representing the greatest risk" (22.8 (invalid formatted quote)). This theme is relevant because it highlights a broader issue with how resources and efforts are allocated to mitigate risks at level crossings, which could have implications for future safety.
- name: Insufficient Implementation of Safety Recommendations
  explanation: Insufficient implementation of safety recommendations is a safety theme related to this accident, as the LCSIA report's recommended risk treatments, such as the closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing or the installation of half-arm barriers, were not acted upon. "neither the council nor kiwirail could provide a documented sfairp assessment for the lcsia report's recommendation to close mulcocks road level crossing" (14.3 (invalid formatted quote)). The failure to implement these recommendations, which could have prevented the accident, points to a systemic issue in the follow-through of safety measures.
- name: Inadequate Guidance for Risk Treatment Assessments
  explanation: Inadequate guidance for risk treatment assessments is a safety theme because the industry lacks documented processes and minimal guidance on how to undertake SFAIRP assessments for level crossing risk treatments. "sfairp assessments were not being routinely carried out for risk treatments recommended in lcsia reports. no documented process, and minimal guidance, on sfairp assessment for level crossing risk treatments was available in industry documents" (22.7 (invalid formatted quote)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that there is a gap in the knowledge or procedures necessary to properly assess and manage risks at level crossings.
- name: Ambiguity in Risk Assessment Conversion Thresholds
  explanation: Ambiguity in risk assessment conversion thresholds is a safety theme identified in the report, as there is confusion in the guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values, particularly in the 20.0 - 20.6 range. "the guidance for converting alcam risk scores to lcss values is ambiguous for alcam risk scores in the 20.0 - 20.6 range" (22.9 (invalid formatted quote)). This ambiguity could lead to inconsistencies in risk assessments and potentially impact the prioritization and treatment of level crossing risks.
