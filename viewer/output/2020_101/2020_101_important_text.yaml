  \ collision between a large road vehicle and a passenger train travelling at 90\
  \ \nkilometres per hour is a serious incident with potential ly serious consequences.\
  \  It has \nthe potential  to derail the train, injur e persons  and cause significant\
  \ dam age to \nequipment.  \n There are approximately 1500 public level crossings\
  \ throughout New Zealand . Except \nfor rail passengers  at platforms and onboard\
  \  trains , these level crossing  sites account \nfor the vast bulk of instances\
  \ where members of the public  enter th e rail corridor  and \nare consequently\
  \ put at risk . Considerable effort has been made to  improv e protection  \nat\
  \ level crossings , which has requir ed substantial resources and funding.  Despite\
  \  these  \nongoing safety improvements , level crossings remain a significant risk\
  \  and one that can \nbe expected to grow with increasing road and rail traffic\
  \ . \n The Commission's analysis for this accident examine s its immediate causes\
  \ and \ncircumstances. It also examines the wider issues surrounding risk assessment\
  \ and  risk \nmanagement for level crossings, of relevance  due to Mulcocks Road\
  \  level crossing  \nbeing one of a limited number to have undergone assessment\
  \ under the recently -\ndeveloped LCSIA process.  \nDistracted driving  \n The Commission\
  \ determined the flashing lights and be lls were virtually  certain  to \nhave been\
  \ working correctly at the time the  truck approached the level crossing . The \n\
  witness' account of seeing the flashing lights , and the RIC's account of the flashing\
  \ \nlights and bell s still being active when they attended the site , both support\
  \ this.  \n Separate independent accounts  from  the witness and the train driver\
  \  observed the \ntruck slowing significantly before it reached the level crossing.\
  \ The Commission have \ntherefore found it very likely  that its driver reco gnised\
  \ and reacted to the active \nflashing lights and bells , intending to stop the\
  \ truck before the level crossing and then \nremain stopped until after the train\
  \ had passed.  \n The truck's slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the\
  \ lead -up to the coll ision \nwas very likely  due to its driver  not applying\
  \ sufficient pressure to the brake pedal. \nOther explanations for this forward\
  \ crawl, such as mechanical failure of the truck's \nbraking system  or the driver's\
  \ foot slipping completely  from the brake pedal , were \nconsidered in the Commission's\
  \ analysis . These were eventually discounted because no \nsuch issues were noted\
  \ in the truck's pre -accident or post -accident inspections and \nthere were no\
  \ witness accounts of any  apparent attempt by its driver to react to s uch a \n\
  failure  or error . \n The Commission found no evidence of the truck losing traction\
  \ with the road surface \nprior to the collision, and it is therefore exceptionally\
  \ unlikely  that the low tread on \nthree of the truck's four rear tyres contributed\
  \ to this accident in any way.  \n It is very likely  that the  truck driver's \
  \ peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were \nrestricted and as a result they\
  \ were unable to detect the truck's subtle forward \nmovement. This assessment is\
  \ based on the  truck's  slow forward crawl itself and the \nwitnes s' observation\
  \ of its driver looking down towards, and reaching with their left \n \nFinal Report\
  \ RO -2020 -101 |  \n<< Page 13 >>\n arm into, the passenger side area. It is very\
  \ likely the truck driver believed the truck to \nbe stationary and  felt it safe\
  \ to divert their attention from the truck's surroundin gs. \n The Commission was\
  \ unable to determine  the precise  source of  the distraction that \ncaused the\
  \  truck's  driver to divert their attention  away  from the truck's surroundings.\
  \  \n New Zealand  law prohibits  the use of  mobile phones while driving  road\
  \ vehicles. An \nexception to this is that a driver may, while driving a vehicle,\
  \ use a mobile phone  for \ntelephone  calls if: \n\u2022 the phone is secured in\
  \ a mounting fixed to the vehicle  \n\u2022 the driver manipulates the phone infrequently\
  \ and briefly . \n The Commission was unable to determine if the truck  driver \
  \ was utilising the hands -\nfree mounting fitted to the truck dashboard at the\
  \ time of the accident. The magnetic \ncoupling between their mobile phone and the\
  \ mounting  is exceptional ly unlikely  to \nhave  withstood the collision force\
  \ s, so no conclusion can be made from the  mobile \nphone  being found outside\
  \ the truck 's cab.  \n The truck driver being engaged in a mobile phone call does\
  \ not itself explain why their \nvisual attention was not on the truck's surrounding\
  \ s, but still likely  contri buted to their \noverall level of distraction  and\
  \ lack of situational awareness . \n The position of the sun in relation to the\
  \ truck driver's field of vision would have \nincreased the difficulty  for them\
  \ to see the approach ing train.  However , as established \nabove, it is very unlikely\
  \  that the truck driver's visual focus was towards the \napproaching train. Sun\
  \ -strike24 itself is therefore judged very unlikely  to have \nsignificantly contribut\
  \ ed to this accident , but may have further limit ed the peripheral \nvision  cues\
  \ available to the truck driver .  \n \n24 A condition that occurs in vehicles when\
  \ the angle of sunligh t hitting a windscreen creates glare that is very \nhard\
  \ for a driver to see through . \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO-2020 -101\
  \ Mulcocks Road LCSIA  report and action taken  \nSafety issue: SFAIRP assessments\
  \ were not being routinely carried out for risk treatments \nrecommended in LCSIA\
  \ reports . No process , and minimal guidance , on SFAIRP asse ssment for \nlevel\
  \ crossing risk treatments was available  in industry documents.  \nCrossing closure\
  \  \n The LCSIA report's recommended 'Criterion  1' risk treatment , closure  of\
  \ Mulcocks Road \nlevel crossing, would virtually certain ly have prevented this\
  \ accident . \n The LCSIA process requires 'Criterion 1'  risk treatments be given\
  \ first considera tion. Its \nguidance document ation  provides  a flowchart , an\
  \ excerpt of which is  shown in Figure 8 \nbelow . The path overlaid in green  show\
  \ s the process  that crossing closure should have \nfollowed,  arriving at 'Is\
  \ treatment  suitable given constraints? ' This step represents a \njoint SFAIRP\
  \ assessment  between KiwiRail and the Council . \n  \nFigure 8: Process for new\
  \ and modified existing level crossings, \nMulcocks  Road level  crossing  closure\
  \  overlaid  \n(Credit: Figure 4 of Level Crossing Risk Assessment Guidance version\
  \ 1, Waka Kotahi/KiwiRail)  \n Neither the Council nor KiwiRail could provide a\
  \  documented SFAIRP assessment  for \nthe LCSIA report's recommendation to close\
  \  Mulcocks Road level crossing. Such an \nassessment  - if it had occurred - may\
  \ legitimately have concluded crossing closure as \nbeing not reasonably practicable\
  \ , but this was not formally conducted or documented.  \n \n'Criterion 1' met \
  \ Crossing closure  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -101 |  \n<< Page 15 >>\n Instal\
  \ lation of half -arm barriers  \n Amongst the LCSIA report's recommended 'Criterion\
  \  2' risk treatments  was th e \ninstallation of half-arm barriers , which would\
  \ very likely  have prevented this accident  \neither by:  \n\u2022 the truck driver\
  \  becoming alert  to the truck's movement , by sound or feel,  when it \nstruck\
  \ the barrier arm  \n\u2022 the barrier arm p hysically preventing the truck from\
  \ crawling forwards . \n The LCSIA process requires 'Criterion 2' risk treatments\
  \ be considered if 'Criterion 1' is \nnot reasonably practicable.  Figure 9 again\
  \  shows the  guidance documentation  \nflowchart , but with the path overlaid in\
  \ green representing consideration of half -arm \nbarrier s if crossing closure\
  \ was determin ed to not be reasonably practica ble. Again,  this \narrives at \
  \ a joint SFAIRP assessment  between the Council and KiwiRail .  \n \nFigure 9:\

  arm barriers  for Mulcocks  Road  level  crossing  overlaid  \n(Credit: Figure 4\
  \ of Level Crossing Risk Assessment Guidance version 1, Waka Kotahi/KiwiRail)  \n\
  \ As with  crossing  closure, no documented  SFAIRP  assess ment for the installation\
  \ of \nhalf-arm barriers could be provided by the Council or KiwiRail . Such an\
  \ assessment - if \nit had occurred - may have legitimately  concluded half -arm\
  \ barriers to not be \nreasonably practicable, but this was not formal ly conducted\
  \ or documented.  \n Import antly , issues of short -stacking  at Mulcocks Road\
  \ level crossing  would not have  \nbeen  addressed  by half -arm barriers . Short\
  \ -stacking was a significant factor in the \nestimated risk for the level crossing\
  \ , so despite  not contr ibuting to this accident  this \n'Criterion 2' met  'Criterion\
  \ 1'  \nnot met  \nHalf arm barrier \ninstallation  \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\
  \ Report RO-2020 -101 decreas es the likelihood that half-arm bar riers would have\
  \  been found practicable  in a \nSFAIRP assessment . \nOther recommended risk treatments\
  \  \n Other 'Criterion  2' risk treatments recommended in the LCSIA report (see\
  \ 2.47 for full \nlist) are very unlikely  to have prevented this accident. These\
  \ treatments were \npredominantly aime d at unfamiliar road users recognising the\
  \ level crossing, or at \ncyclists using the new cycleway.  \n As with crossing\
  \ closure and half -arm barriers, n o documented SFAIRP assessment \ncould be provided\
  \ by the Council or KiwiRail for the se other  recommended risk \ntreatments.  \n\
  Formal SFAIRP assessment  \n KiwiRail responded to the Commission's questions  on\
  \ SFAIRP assessment for LCSIA \nrecommendations, stating that no formal policy or\
  \ process existed at the time \nMulcocks Road level crossing 's LCSIA report was\
  \ published  or at the time of the  \naccident.  \n Recommend ed risk treatments\
  \  made  in LCSIA reports  for other level crossings \nthroughout New  Zealand have\
  \  similarly not been formally SFAIRP -assessed , although \nmany have been implemented\
  \ . \n Amongst other documents  available to industry  there are references to \
  \ SFAIRP  \nassessment for identified level crossing risk treatments. Included in\
  \ these is  Waka \nKotahi 's Traffic control devices manual  (TCDM ) Part 9  for\
  \ level crossings . However , no \nprocess or guidance on how to un dertake a  SFAIRP\
  \ assessment  for level crossings is \nprovided in these documents . \nContext for\
  \  Mulcocks Road  level crossing  LCSIA  \nSafe ty issue: Level crossing safety\
  \ scores (LCSS) have little influenc e on the prioritisation  of \nlevel crossing\
  \ upgrades . \n The Commission has undertaken a review of other available LCSIA\
  \ reports to gain \nperspective on Mulcocks Road level crossing's 'updated existing'\
  \ LCSS value of 43/60  \nrelative to others throughout New  Zealand.  \n Around\
  \ 200 LCSIAs25 were made available to the Commission by KiwiRail, who review \n\
  and approve all reports before they are published . Of these, 70 were  selected\
  \ as \nsuitable for comparison with Mulcocks Road  level crossing . These are presented\
  \ in \nAppendix 2 , along with the rationale for their selection . \n LCSS values\
  \  were taken from  these  comparable  LCSIAs and adjusted to reflect the most \n\
  up-to-date methodology for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values ( Appendix\
  \ 2 \ndetails th ese adjustment s). This aimed to achieve as close to a like-for-like\
  \ comparison \nas possible.   \n \n25 LCSIAs in this context are determined as a\
  \ set of LCSS scores and recommendations for an individual road or \npedestrian\
  \ crossing. In many cases , a single LCSIA report will  include several LCSIAs for\
  \ either different level \ncrossings or separate roadway/pedestrian crossings at\
  \ the same location . \n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -101 |  \n<< Page 17 >>\n \n Adjusted\
  \ LCSS  values were com pared across all 70 selected  LCSIAs. The overall \ndistribution\
  \ - and Mulcocks Road level crossing's position within it  - are presented in  \n\
  Figure 10 below , along with LCSIA risk bands .26 \n   \nFigure 10: LCSS distribution\
  \ for comparable LCSIAs  \n This puts Mulcocks Road level crossing  in the 94th\
  \ percentile , or fifth-ranked overall, for \nLCSIA -estimated  risk amongst this\
  \ sample group . \n This position demonstrates how Mulcocks Road  level crossing\
  \ , despite its ALCAM risk \nscore and being  outside KiwiRail's 'Top 200' ALCAM\
  \ list, was identified  by the LCSIA \nprocess  as comparatively  high risk. \n\
  \ Even if Mulcocks Road l evel crossing had been assessed at its maximum possible\
  \  \n'updated existing'  LCSS of 55/60 ,27 this would not have affected the  risk\
  \ treatments  \nrecommended  in its LCSIA  or their evaluation against 'Criteria\
  \ 1 and 2' . Crossing  \nclosure would still have been the 'Criterion  1' recommended\
  \  risk treatment  and half -\narm barriers  etc would still have satisfied  'Criterion\
  \  2'. \n It is then also very unlikely  that an L CSS of 55/60 would have influenced\
  \ the  Council \nand KiwiRail's  informal SF AIRP assessments . The Council's assessment\
  \ of crossing \nclosure  impracticability did not take account of raw LCSS value\
  \ s, and Mulcocks Road \nlevel crossing's position outside KiwiRail's 'Top 200'\
  \ ALCAM  list was the predominating \nfactor in  half-arm barriers being assessed\
  \ as not practicable.  \n \n26 These risk bands classify risk based on LCSS intervals\
  \ of 10. See Appendix 1  for further explanation.  \n27 Based on 25/30 for Mulcocks\
  \ Road level crossing's ALCAM risk s core of 24.1 and then 10/10 for each of the\
  \ \nthree other risk -estimation components. Appendix 1  explains the composition\
  \ of LCSS values.  024681012\n<12\n12-13\n14-15\n16-17\n18-19\n20-21\n22-23\n24-25\n\

  \ RO-2020 -101 Regular risk review LCSIAs  \nSafet y issue: Selection of level crossings\
  \ for regular risk review LCSIAs , and often upgrade,  is \nnot being  effectively\
  \ prioritise d towards  those with greatest estimated  risk. \n Level crossing safety\
  \ assessment and upgrade  should be prioritis ed to select level \ncrossings with\
  \ the greatest  associated risk. This is especially  true where available \nfunding\
  \ and resources  for upgrades  is constrained . \n Prioritised selection of level\
  \ crossings was not a contributing factor in this accident. \nMulcocks Road level\
  \ crossing underwent its LCSIA due to a 'change in use' (the \nconstruction of the\
  \ cycleway) and other  risk indicators, such as its ALCAM  risk score,  \ndid not\
  \ identi fy it as  especially high risk . \n 'Regular risk review ' LCSIAs are those\
  \ carried out to assess existing risk  of a level \ncrossing . This is where the\
  \ opportunity exists to selectively priori tise level crossing s for \ndetailed\
  \ risk estimation  under the LCSIA proce ss, rather than the essentially random\
  \ \nselection for ' change in use '. \n The Commissi on's review of comparable LCSIAs\
  \ identified 20 of the 70 as being \nundertaken for 'regular risk review '. The\
  \ remainder were  all 'change in use' . \n Figure 11 below  shows the ALCAM fatal\
  \ return period28 against  the adjusted  'updated \nexisting' LCSS for these 20\
  \ ' regular risk review ' LCSIAs.  In each case the ALCAM data \nwas known prior\
  \ to the LCSIA being undertaken, while  the LCSS  was only known \nafterwards .\
  \ Mulcocks Road level crossing 's LCSIA , undertaken for 'change in use', is \n\
  also included for its context.  \n \nFigure 11: LCSIAs undertaken for regular risk\
  \ review  \n(and Mulcocks Road level crossing) , by ALCAM  fatal  return period\
  \  \n Figure 11 indicates where  selection for  'regular risk review ' LCSIAs  has\
  \ not be en \neffectively prioritised by ALCAM data. 45 per cent  are outside of\
  \ ALCAM's 'high risk' \nband and 55 per  cent have a longer ALCAM fatal re turn\
  \ period  than Mulcocks Road  \n \n28 The fatal return period is ALCAM's estimated\
  \ number of years between equivalent fatalities (see footnote 16). It \nis the inverse\
  \ of the ALCAM risk score (see Appendix 1  for further explanation).  Alabama Rd\n\

  \ would instead show  data points \ntightly grouped towards the left side of the\
  \ 'high risk' ba nd. \n Any alternative prioritisation could be demonstra ted as\
  \ effective by its resultant LCSS \nvalues. That is, undertaking LCSIAs  - and upgrades\
  \  - for level crossings with low \nALCAM risk scores could be justified if the\
  \  LCSIA process then identified the se as being  \nhigh risk. With some exceptions,\
  \ most notabl y Norman Avenue, this is not apparent in \nFigure 11. \n In the example\
  \  of SH27 Waitoa, which was upgrade d to half -arm barriers, the LCSIA \nprocess\
  \ in fact found th is level  crossing in its existing state  to meet 'Criteria 1'\
  \ and \ntherefore to be a 'broadly acceptable risk' .29 This demonstrates where\
  \ level crossing \nupgrade resources are being consumed by a level crossing with\
  \ low relative risk.  \n The selection rationale for ' regular risk review ' LCSIAs,\
  \ and indeed upgrades in many \ncases, was not clearly stated in most reports. \
  \ Instead , many30 simply included 'KiwiRail \nare planning to construct half -arm\
  \ barriers\u2026 ' or similar statements , with no elaboration \non why a  particular\
  \  level crossing had been selected.  \n Equally, several level crossings in the\
  \ Wairarapa region31 were grouped into one report \nfor their geographical proximity.\
  \ No upgrade proposals were in place at this time, and \ninstead the report was\
  \ aimed at scoping suitab le proposals. This approach will have \nbenefited from\
  \ a lower per -level crossing cost to conduct LCSIAs.  \n In the broad er context\
  \ , New Zealand's  greatest ALCAM risk score was 218 ,32 equat ing \nto a 46 -year\
  \ fatal return period.  The greatest ALCAM risk score a mongst the 20 'regular \n\
  risk review ' LCSIAs was  only 59.0 for SH93 Bridge Street  (equating to  a 169\
  \ -year fatal \nreturn period ). \n Figure 12 below  shows this shortfall between\
  \ level crossings with the greatest ALCAM \nrisk scores and those that have been\
  \ selected for 'regular risk review' LCSIAs.  \n \n29 Where a risk is judged as\
  \ low enough to not warrant consideration of further reduction or mitigation. Not\
  \ \ngenerally considered a fixed threshold, it differs between different industries\
  \ and activities, and shifts with \nchanges in societal attitudes towards  risk.\
