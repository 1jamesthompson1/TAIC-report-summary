2014_103,005/15,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency require a full review of the National Rail System standards, and in particular standard No. 6, to ensure that low adhesion braking requirements are defined in the standards and made applicable for all trains intended to operate on the National Rail System.","Rail Standards for New Trains

The National Rail System Standards (6) (Engineering and Interoperability) is the only standard within the National Rail System set that defines braking performance. However, it does not address the performance in low adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer controlled brake and wheel slide protection systems. The current National Rail System Standard (6) does not require any more from a braking system than for a train to be able to stop within a specified distance in dry conditions.

The regulator for the country of operation or the purchaser may define what adhesion conditions might be encountered on a rail network and what level of braking performance is expected from a new train and what standards the train is to be tested to for compliance. This is also the stage in commissioning a new train, when the interaction between all of the brake systems is adjusted to achieve the optimum overall brake performance.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board in UK have produced a Guidance Note (GM/GN2695) to achieve this purpose in the UK but nothing similar exists for New Zealand.

The Matangi train brake systems were tested for compliance and proper operation, but they were not tested and adjusted for optimum brake performance in low adhesion conditions.

In Wellington, where new trains were commissioned into service with computer controlled braking and wheel slide protection systems, but that the complete train braking systems were not optimised to achieve the most effective brake performance in low adhesion conditions.  The Commission considers that the occurrences in Wellington may be repeated unless the National Rail System standards are revised. 

As a minimum the Commission considers that the National Rail System standards should call upon appropriate international standards to formalise new train type testing and ensure that train braking systems are tested in low adhesion conditions and optimised for the train.

2014_103,006/15,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency review the process followed for the commissioning of the Auckland trains, and if they have not been optimised for low adhesion conditions or adhesion management systems introduced to reduce the risk of incidents across the network, he address those safety issues in line with the safety actions planned for the Matangi train operation.""","Auckland Trains

The Commission is aware that new passenger trains have recently been introduced in Auckland.  The Commission is not aware of any safety issues with the new trains but expects they would have been tested to comply with the same National Rail System standards as the Matangi trains in Wellington. Therefore, they may be exposed to the same lack of optimised brake performance risks in low adhesion conditions.

2014_103,021/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail relocate the terminal pole for the overhead line at Melling Station to be clear of the potential train overrun path.,"The stop block at Melling was mounted directly in front of the terminal (last) pole supporting the high-voltage overhead contact wire for the electric trains. At the previous collision in 2013 the support structure was damaged, and in this recent 2014 event the pole was snapped off at ground level, causing the overhead contact wire to drop onto the body of the train. The fallen high-voltage line created a risk to the train occupants and delayed the evacuation of the train after it came to rest.
Placing the power pole directly in line with the stop block was a safety issue that increased the potential consequences of a train overrunning the station platform and striking the stop block.

"
2014_103,018/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail apply a suitable permanent speed restriction to the last section of the Melling Line to reduce the approach speed to Melling Station.,"Two trains have collided with the stop block at Melling Station in the space of just over one year. The normal line speed for the section of track between the preceding station and Melling is 70 km/h. The Melling Station platform only becomes clearly visible to the train driver once the train has rounded the last bend, about 400 m from the stop block. If trains were restricted to a lower speed before they rounded the last bend, the risk of a platform overrun and resulting collision with the stop block would be reduced.
"
2014_103,020/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail replace the type of stop block that was in use at Melling with a new shock-absorbing type design that would be matched to the likely impact forces from a Matangi train.,"The stop block installed at Melling was a solid concrete block with a limited ability to absorb impact forces. It was physically shifted in the first collision, and even further in the second. The second impact also split the concrete block near ground level and allowed it to rotate backward under the train. The train rode up and over the stop block as a consequence, sustaining substantial damage.
Modern shock-absorbing stop blocks used on other terminating train stations on the controlled network reduce the consequences in terms of injury to persons and damage to trains if overruns should occur that lead to trains striking the stop blocks.
"
2014_103,019/14,The Commission further recommends that KiwiRail assess all other terminating stations on the controlled network throughout New Zealand and similarly apply permanent speed restrictions as necessary to the approaches at those stations.,
