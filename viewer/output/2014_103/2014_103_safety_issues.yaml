- safety_issue: 'A key safety issue was that the National Rail System Standards (NRSS) did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard. Consequently, the train brake system had not been optimised for low-adhesion conditions.

- safety_issue: 'The fact that the driver of the Melling 2 train had cannabis in his system is a serious safety issue.

- safety_issue: 'The operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform at Melling Station and colliding with the stop block had not been adequately considered. No special speed restriction for the approach had been set; the stop block was an older and less effective design than its modern equivalent; and the pole carrying the overhead traction power line was placed directly behind the stop block where it was prone to damage.

- safety_issue: 'The Matangi braking and wheel-slide protection systems were not performing as well as they could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for optimum braking in low-adhesion conditions before the trains were commissioned to service.

- safety_issue: 'The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer-controlled brake and wheel-slide protection systems.

- safety_issue: 'The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems.
