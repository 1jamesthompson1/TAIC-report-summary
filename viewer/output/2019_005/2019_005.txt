No repeat  accidents - ever!  
"The principal purpose of the Commission shall be to determine the circumstances and 
causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future, 
rather than to ascribe blame to any person."  
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
 
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown 
entity and standing commission of inquiry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and 
rail accidents and incidents that occur in New Zealand or involve New Zealand -registered 
aircraft or vessels.  
Our investigations are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve s afety. Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue criminal, civil, or regulatory action.  
At the end of every inquiry, we share all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve sa fety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) tha t an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The Commission 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be  admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1. On 22 April 2019 , the operator was conducting a medical evacuation flight under 
visual flight rules  (VFR) with a BK117 -C1 helicopter , registration ZK -IMX. On board 
was the pilot, a paramedic in the front left-hand  seat, and a wi nch operator in the rear 
cabin. The helicopter was to position south of New Zealand at Auckland Islands that 
day (the positioning flight ). After camping overnight  on Enderby Island , the helicopter  
crew would  rendezvous  with a fishing ship next day to heli winch1 and evacuate a sick 
crew member back to New Zealand . 
1.2. The positioning flight was intended to arrive during daylight , but unexpected delays 
to the departure time resulted in them arriving after dark. The crew carried night 
vision goggles ( NVGs ) and donned them during the positioning flight to continue 
under VFR using NVGs.  
1.3. The hills and coastline  around Port Ross and part of Enderby Island were  visible  
through NVGs , but the pilot believed that the landing area was covered in cloud . The 
pilot planned an alternative approach  to descend in the clear area to below the cloud  
and then follow the coastline back to the landing area.  
1.4. The pilot descended and was turning back towards the landing area when the crew 
member (paramedic in front left -hand seat) alerted them to cliffs rising immediately 
ahead . The pilot reacted , but the helicopter impacted the sea.  
1.5. The crew were able to escape while the helicopter was partly submerged , but it sank 
soon after. They were all wearing immersion suits that kept them afloat  and enabled 
them to make  their way to shore . After  shelter ing under cover overnight , they were 
spotted the next day by one of the rescue helicopters and brought back to 
Invercargill to be checked in the hospital.   
1.6. The winch operator in the rear cabin was knocked unconscious  during the impact , but 
was able to be evacuated by another crew member . They regained consciousness 
during the swim to shore. Otherwise, the crew only suffered minor injuries .  
1.7. The helicopter was recovered about three  weeks later . 
Why it happened  
1.8. The helicopter was operating normally at the time of the accident.   
1.9. The Commission found that the pilot had misinterpreted the image seen through the 
NVGs  as cloud covering the landing area  when it was very likely  to have been fog 
near the sea surface  and downwind of the shore . The planned descent and approach 
in the clear area was made using visual reference outside and to the global 
positioning system ( GPS) map display. However , the helicopter's descent rate became 
high as the pilot, relying primarily on  visual  depth perception,  believed the helicopter 
was further from the surface of the sea than it was.  When the crew did see an image 
through the NVGs it was the 20-metre high cliffs several hundred metres ahead  and

Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 2 >>
   above them . During the manoeuvre  to avoid the cliffs , the helicopter impacted the 
sea. 
1.10. The Commission found that the operator's exposition2 for single pilot VFR operations 
into the Southern Ocean  was inadequate at the time to manage the risks associated 
with such operations.  The operator has  since made significant improvements , 
including engaging an external auditor  and introducing a new standard operating 
procedure for Sub Antarctic Island flights . Therefore , the Commission considered that 
no safety recommendations to the operator  were necessary . 
1.11. The Commission also identified regulatory gaps in the New Zealand Civil Aviation 
Rules (CARs) regarding minimum saf ety requirements for helicopters  operating under 
Part 119 and Part 135 air operator certificates (AOCs). The gaps related to : 
• Helicopter air ambulance (HAA) operations . 
• Night vision imag ing systems (NVIS) and operations . 
• Crew resource management (CRM) for operations conducted with  multi -
pilot or a single pilot with a non-pilot crew . 
• Pilot logging of NVG flight time.  
1.12. The Commission made two safety recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA) in section 6 to address these safety issues.  
What we c an learn  
1.13. The key lessons from this investigation are listed in section 7. In summary they are  
that: 
• The minimum requirement for NVG currency does not equate to  
proficiency .  
• Helicopter underwater escape training (HUET)  and immersion suits can 
increase surv ivability .  
• If the operation needs crew to wear immersion suits, they should also 
carry essential emergency items on their person . 
• All crew with flight -related duties need to be aware of the importance of 
radio altimeters when conducting NVIS operations and how to interpret 
the instrument and  its alerts.  
• Pilots should ensure their NVG flight time is separately logged . 
• Overloading helicopters is a safety hazard.  
• To be effective, emergency equipment such as a life -raft must also be 
accessible in  an emergency and deployable for the crew to use.   
Who may benefit  
1.14. Pilots  and operators involved with HAA operations , those using NVIS , and the 
regulator may benefit from the findings and recommendations in this report.

Pārongo pono 
Narrative  
The task plan 
2.1. On 22 April 2019, a Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI)  BK117 -C1 helicopter, registered 
ZK-IMX (the helicopter) , was tasked by Southern Lakes Helicopters (the operator) for 
a medical evacuation (medivac) in the Southern Ocean off Auckland Islands. A crew  
member on board a fishing vessel required urgent hospital treatment and the first aid 
stocks on the vessel needed replenishment .  
2.2. The helicopter was based in Te Anau. The vessel was 210 nautical miles ( nm) south of 
Auckland Islands, but intended  to make way  towards this destination  where it would 
anchor in a sheltered area for the medivac transfer . The vessel was expected to arrive 
at the rendezvous point at about 0750 on 23 April 2019.  
2.3. The flight was to be conducted under VFR . Due to a  frontal weather system 
approaching New Zealand  from south of Auckland Islands , the operator planned to 
position the helicopter at this destination  prior to the front arriving  there . They would 
stay overnight and then comple te the medivac  and return to Invercargill the next day .  
2.4. The helicopter crew would stay at a hut on Enderby Island  where the  operator  had a 
fuel store . The plan was to take minimal equipment out to the rendezvous point and 
initially bring the patient back to the hut . The patient would be transferred to a more 
comfortable stretcher  and stabilised, and the helicopter refuelled and then prepared 
for the return flight to Invercargill.  The vessel needed to replenish the medical 
supplies used to treat the patient and these would be delivered during the patient 
transfer.  
2.5. The task was approved by the operator to proceed,  and the crew of one pilot, a 
paramedic and a winch operator was selected. The paramedic and winch operator  
were both trained  and current  'NVIS crew members '.3 They  decided that t he 
paramedic would sit in the front  with the pilot and perform the role of NVIS crew 
member on the flight down . The return flight would be in daylight .  
2.6. The winch operator was some distance away from base at the time,  but was in transit 
by road back to Te Anau . They would be picked up by the helicopter on its way to 
Invercargill.  
2.7. The pilot and paramedic prepared the helicopter and loaded the equipment, but the 
release of the required medical supplies and d elivery to the helicopter delayed the 
departure time.  The original plan had been to arrive at Enderby Island in daylight, but 
the crew were now committed to a night -time arrival.  
The flight  
2.8. The flight left Te Anau at 154 3 for Invercargill with the pilot an d paramedic on board , 
and they picked the winch operator up on the way  at Athol . They refuelled at 
Invercargill and the crew put on their immersion suits and life-jackets. They rechecked

NVIS.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 4 >>
   that the ir NVGs were working and the  pilot fitted theirs  to their helmet . The pilot was 
in the front right seat and the paramedic in the front left  and they both had green 
phos phorus NVGs . The winch operator was sitting in the back next to the left-hand  
side door.  
2.9. The flight departed Invercargill at 1703  and the pilot filed a verbal flight plan with the 
local air traffic controller. The Invercargill air traffic control zone extended south to 
near Stewart Island and the service would go off wat ch before this flight terminated. 
The flight duration to Enderby Island was expected to be about three hours from 
Invercargill.  The pilot  updated the local air traffic controller when the flight departed 
the control zone with an estimated time of arrival ( ETA) at Enderby Island of 1944.  
They initially set off at about 6000 -7000 feet, but dropped down to cruise under 3000 
feet most of the way because the wind was more favourable at that altitude.   
2.10. The operator provided their own flight following and communications service for all 
its oper ations , and was monitoring this flight with  a satellite tracking system 
(TracPlus ) fitted to the helicopter . The flight following service was provided from its 
base office at Te Anau  during working hours  and by the chief pilot  from their  home 
after hours.  They also had very high frequency ( VHF) radio contact for part of the 
route through the operator's repeater at Stewart Island and by satellite phone 
beyond that . The pilot regularly called back to base during the flight with pos ition 
and operational reports.  
2.11. At about 90  nm from Enderby  Island , at approximately 1850 , the pilot contacted the 
chief pilot to discuss the flight's progress and decide if it was suitable  to continue. 
They were still in daylight at their altitude and could see the cloud with the 
approaching frontal system on the horizon . After a discussion with the chief pilot , 
they decided to continue . 
2.12. Civil t wilight4 had ended  in their location at 183 1, and the pilot and paramedic 
confirmed in a situation report to base logged at 1858 that they were on NVGs. They 
could see the hills of Auckland Islands on the horizon  about 60 nm ahead. The winch 
operator in the back was not using NVGs, and recalled it being pitch black.  
2.13. The pilot discussed their view of the  approach to the landing point with the 
paramedic. They both recalled that a  large bank of cloud covered the landing point 
and extended to the south , but that there was a clear area over Port Ross extend ing 
out toward the north west. If they could not follo w the coastline,  they had alternative 
landing points on the island s programmed into the GPS that they could land at and 
camp out for the night. The pilot pointed out the area clear of cloud  and advised the 
paramedic that they would continue to head south past Ewing Island, descend in the 
clear area , and fly back along the beach to the planned landing point  on Enderby 
Island . They turned south at 1934, passing 1.5 nm to the east of the landing point . 
2.14. The pilot said they set the radio altimeter5 reference to 1000 feet and started a 
descent . After reaching the set height, the pilot reset the reference to 500 feet and 
contin ued to descend. The pilot then reset the radio altimeter  to 250 feet and slowed 
to 75 knots , but continued  to desce nd on a westerly heading about 0.25 nm south of 
 
4 Night is defined as beginning at the end of civil twi light, which is when the centre of the setting sun's disk is 6 
degrees below the horizon.  
5 The radio altimeter does not use air pressure. It measures the height above the surface below using a radio 
signal  reflected from that surface. The manually set reference height  with the height setting bug,  activates an 
alert when the aircraft descends be low that setting.  See Glossary  for more on altimetry.

 Ewing Island . The paramedic alerted the pilot to some  cliffs that appeared directly 
ahead  in their flight path. The pilot flared to slow the helicopter and started to turn 
north to avoid the cliffs. T he helicopter stopped suddenly when it hit the water  at 
1937 . 
Post -impact  
2.15. The helicopter had impacted the water at speed and flipped upside down, but initially 
remained partially submerged at the surface. It was dark , but there was enough light 
for the crew to see each other and make out their surroundings. The two front seat 
crew escaped underwater and gathered on the northern side of the helicopter. The 
winch operator had been knocked unconscious in the accident and was dragged out 
of the helicopter by the paramedic. The NVGs the front seat crew were wearing had 
been lost in the accident. The crew recalled that the sea state was dead calm. Some 
floating items were collected , and after extracting the winch operator the paramedic 
re-entered the rear of the cab in with the intention of retrieving the life -raft. However, 
in the darkness it was difficult to identify the various items and a gear -bag was 
mistakenly taken instead. The helicopter sank shortly after along with the emergency 
bag. 
2.16. None of the crew had an emergency beacon or survival equipment on their person or 
in their immersion suit pockets. They had packed all their personal locator beacons 
(PLBs) and other survival gear into an emergency grab-bag that was stowed in the 
rear cabin and this was lost with the helicopter when it sank.  
2.17. The crew could see the outline of the cliffs about 100 metres away and were 
supported in their immersion suits without needing to inflate their life -jackets. They 
paddled as a group to the cliffs and climbed through a kelp bed onto the rocks. The 
winch operator had regained consciousness, but needed assistance from the other 
two. They made their way along the coastline to the north and found shelter in the 
bush for th e night.  
2.18. The crew heard an Orion aircraft fly overhead at times during the night, but were not 
able to make a signal to attract attention. They also saw vessels out off the coast at 
times, but again could not attract attention.  
The rescue  
2.19. The chief pilot  was monitoring the flight and immediately noticed the flight following 
signals had stopped updating . After attempting to contact the helicopter crew on the 
satellite phone , and confirming with the TracPlus call centre that it was not a system 
fault, the c hief pilot notified the Rescue Coordination Centre  New Zealand (RCC NZ) at 
2008. 
2.20. RCCNZ tasked  a Royal New Zealand Air Force  (RNZAF ) P3 Orion aircraft to conduct a 
visual search near the last known point.  The P3 Orion left from RNZAF Base 
Whenuapai at 2251  and arrived on scene early next morning at 0120. Cloud cover 
prevented a close search at low level so an  infrared scan was conducted searching for 
life forms . Flares were dropped along the east coa st of Auckland Island s. The P3  
Orion continued to patrol the search area  during the night  and then  departed the 
scene  at 0815 for RNZAF Base Ohakea to  refuel and change crew.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 6 >>
   2.21. RCCNZ also tasked five fishing vessels operating nearby to assist with a sea search. 
The first fishing vessel arrived in the area on 22 April at 2323 . The Antarctic Discovery6 
also headed to the area , but then diverted to Bluff with their patient . The f ive fishing 
vessels remained on scene and conducted a coordinated search in the designa ted 
search area . This extended south  of Ewing Island towards  and beyond  Yule Island . At 
0803 , one of the fishing vessels found the left -hand  sliding cargo  door from the 
helicopter floating within the search area.   
2.22. Three rescue helicopters departed New Zeal and at about 1015 on 23 April 2019. The 
first arrived on scene at 1142 and saw the three crew  mem bers in their brightly 
coloured immersion suits walking on a beach near Crozier Point at 11 45. The other 
two rescue helicopters dispatched from Dunedin arrived a few minutes later . After 
providing first aid to the three crew and refuelling, the rescue helicopters  flew the 
crew to Invercargill  hospital . 
2.23. The wreck was observed in the water just off the  north east coast  of Auckland Island s 
near Ewing Island . It was upside down in water about 15  metres de ep.

2.24. Most of the wreckage was retrieved 18 days later by a private operation and taken to 
Bluff for inspection  by Commission investigators . The tail boom and main rotors were 
not retrieved. The wreckage  was later transported to  the Commission 's technical 
facility in Wellington .

2.25. The pilot held a commercial pilot licence for helicopters CPL(H) from  2006 with 
approximately 6673 hours  logged  before the accident flight  and was rated for VFR 
only. Recent flights included 43 hours on the BK117 ty pe of helicopter during the last 
90 days and 135 hours on all types in the same period. The pilot held a Class 1 
medical certificate valid to 26 August 2019  and was required to have spectacles 
readily available with a spare set.  
2.26. All required competency assessments were complete and current in accordance with 
CARs and the operator's exposition.  The pilot's f light crew check and training for NVG 
(AC91 -13), sling load (Part 133) and air operations (Part 135)  were revalidated in 
December 2018 and current until 27 December 2020.  
2.27. The operator arranged other training specific for their operations. The pilot had 
completed HUET  training in July 2013.  In 2014, the pilot completed a specialist 
helicopter CRM training course for low -level helicopter operations. This was run in 
New Zealand by an organisation  from the United States of America  (USA) , Utilities 
Aviation Specialists . In 2018, the pilot attended a two-hour human factors course 
based on the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA) Handbook AMT -8083 -30, 
Chapter 14  (FAA, 2018) . 
2.28. The pilot received initial NVG ground training in 2013  and then completed  a pilot-
specific NVG training course later that year.  At the time of the accident flight, the 
pilot had about 73 hours of total flight time at night . The pilot did not distinguish 
between n ight VFR or night VFR flight on NVGs  in their l ogbook, but said all recent 
night flight time with the operator was on NVGs .  
2.29. The pilot had logged 0.5 hours on NVG s in the last seven days before the accident 
and another 0.4 in the last 90 days. Both  night flights  started as a daytime flight, but 
returned at night. The p ilot advised that they ensured each recent night flight 
included three take -offs and landings on NV Gs to maintain their curren cy.7 The pilot 
did not hold an instrument flight rules (IFR) rating, nor was this required for NVIS 
operations. The pilot's total  instrument time recorded i n their logbook was 10.2 
hours.  
Param edic 
2.30. The paramedic was employed by another company and flew as crew with the 
operator when required for medical services. The operator trained the paramedic to 
be an NVIS crew member and ensure d they remained curren t for that role  (see NVIS 
crew members ).  
2.31. The paramedic had undergone a nnual NVG crew training  and records were sighted 
back to 2015. They were current in accordance with the operator's exposition , with 
the last revalidation check  14 days before the accident  flight . The paramedic had a 
total logged time on NVGs at the time of accident of 198 hours.  
2.32. The paramedic had completed their last HUET training on 18 May 2018 with over a 
year to the ir next refresher course after this accident.  The paramedic had received 
 
7 See 2.89 for NVG currency requirements.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 8 >>
   'emergency training ' in accordance with the Operator's exposition for flight over 
water that included life-raft operation, the ditching procedure and  aircraft evacuation . 
2.33. The paramedic had also attended the helicopter C RM training course run by  Utilities 
Aviation Specialists for the low-level environment  in August 2014 . 
Winch operator  
2.34. The winch operator was a casual  employee  to operate the winch when needed . The 
operator had also trained the winch operator as an NVIS crew member and ensured 
they remained current for both  roles. Their last revalidation check for operating the 
winch fitted to the helicopter was completed in June 2017.  
2.35. Their total time on NVGs was 120 hours and they h ad completed a n NVIS crew 
member revalidation check in November 2018.  
2.36. The winch operator last completed a  HUET refresher course in September 2013 , 
which included 'emergency training' in accordance with the Operator's exposition for 
flight over water . That  training  included life -raft operation, the ditching procedure 
and aircraft evacuation . They had also completed  the low -level environment CRM 
training course held in 2014.  
Aircraft information   
2.37. The BK117 -C1 helicopter was constructed in 1996 by KHI in Japan . It was  imported to 
New Zealand with the certificate of airworthiness completed on 5 May 2016 at 5387 
hours. It was purchased by the operator on 6 July 2017 .  
2.38. The helicopter 's last recorded total flight time was 6558 .95 hours at 23 March 2019 , 
30 days before the accident. The helicopter's Technical Log , where more recent flights 
were recorded, was lost at sea. The helicopter had been maintained in accordance 
with the operator's approved maintenance programme  for KHI B K117 -C1. The 
maintenance logbooks showed that all scheduled maintenance had been carried out 
as required, and the helicopter had no recorded defects at the time of the accident.  
2.39. The BK117 has a four -bladed rigid rotor system that rotates anti-clockwise (wh en 
viewed from above) . The pilot sits on the right -hand  side. The helicopter had two 
Turbomeca Arriel 1E2 engines rated at 692 shaft horsepower each.  
2.40. The helicopter had NVIS compatible instrument lighting installed in April 2017, which 
was certified in sim ulated blackout conditions by the CAA in December 2017. The 
helicopter was listed on the operator's AOC as being NVIS compatible and that NVIS 
certification was current at the time of the accident.  
2.41. The helicopter was fitted with a radio altimeter that had a single display in the pilot's 
console . It had a manually adjusted height alert setting8 with a visual indication light 
that illuminated when the helicopter was at , or below , the selected height. It did not 
have an aural alert signal.  The radio altimeter display was visible from the left-hand  
seat, but any person seated there  would need to lean towards the pilot to read 
heights without parallax error. The helicopter also had an autopilot system.

 Weight and balance  
2.42. The helicopter's emp ty weight recorded in the logbook on 21 February 2019 was 
2101 kilograms. The helicopter 's type certificate stated that the maximum certified 
take-off weight was 3350 kilograms.  
2.43. The operator had a set of standard helicopter loading guides to enable pilots to 
quickly check the loading was correct. In this case the appropriate guide was called 
'Weight Loading Guide - BK117 -C1 Medivac Configuration ' (see Appendix 1 ).  
2.44. The exposition9 required  pilots to use a weight and balance application on their 
phone,  or a company iPad call ed iBal Rotary , and to email the loading file to the 
office  for flight following . Alternatively,  they could use the guides. In this case the 
pilot used the iBal Rotary  application on their phone,  but did not email a copy to the 
office. The helicopter loading was checked for this investigation by using the standard 
weight loading guide . 
2.45. The operator 's standard loading guide for  a medivac operation in this helicopter  
allowed for  a typical medivac configuration, from which the pilot could then select 
the appropriate fuel loa ding. In this case, the aircraft was configured with full fuel, 
plus two full external range extender fuel pods  for a flight duration of 3.4 hours  plus 
internal cargo  and three crew . The return flight would have an additional medivac 
passenger .  
2.46. According to the guide, 166 kilograms was available for cargo , including  a 100 -
kilogram pilot and the standard medivac  equipment  of seating, oxygen, stretchers , 
life-raft and life -jackets . Items recovered post -accident were taken to the 
Commission's technical facili ty and weighed. The weights of m issing items that were 
known to be on board  were estimated. In  this case , the excess cargo  included : a 
winch, the associated  winch  stretcher and gear, a long-distance  internal stretcher, 
additional medical equipment, a fuel transfer pump, the crew's survival kit, three 
NVGs  and their containers , camping gear , food  for three people overnight, and the 
two crew members with their immers ion suits and helmets  (see Appendix 2  for 
calculated weight ). 
2.47. The exposition  at the time stated that the final loading check was for the pilot to 
conduct a dynamic  power and control check in the hover position before 
continuing.10 
Meteorological  information  
2.48. The flight was conducted as a Commercial Transport Operation (CTO) under VFR . This 
meant that the pilot was required to manoeuvre the helicopter so that other traffic 
and any obstructions  could be observed in time to avoid a collision . The night 
approach into Enderby Island required meteorological conditions of not less than a 
2000 foot AGL cloud ceiling and a flight visibility of not less than 5 kilometres.11

   2.49. The MetService provided the Commission with a description of the weather situation 
for the 48-hour period covering the accident12 from 000 0 NZST13 22 April 2019 to 
0000 NZS T 24 April 2019 : 
At the start of the period a narrow ridge lay over the southern South Island, and 
a weak warm front over the Auckland Islands. The observations from Enderby 
Island suggest that there was low st ratus and drizzle over the Auckland Islands 
at this time. The weak warm front moved away to east and weakened further 
around mid -morning on 22 April 2019.  
The Enderby Island observations show that the drizzle ceased at this time, 
however the relatively humidity remain ed high and the air temperature w as 
close to the sea surface temperature. This would suggest that sea fog or low 
stratus persisted about the Auckland Islands from mid -morning on 22 April 
2019 until the early morning of the 23 April 2019.  
A cold front then arrived from the west crossing the Auckland Islands around 
0800 NZST 23 April and continued northeast, passing through Invercargill 
around 1800 NZST 23 April 2019. The Enderby Island observations showed a 
period of rain from 0300 to 0930 NZST 23 April 2019 associated with this cold 
front. Following the cold front, it was initially fine over the Auckland Islands, but 
cloud periods gradually increased and it is possible that there were a few light 
showers.  
Sea: 1m occasional 1.5m, but eased  for a time around dawn on 22 April 2019, 
and rose to 1.5m occasional 2.2m from the afternoon of 23 April.  
Swell: Westerly between 2.5 to 3m through the period, sheltered east of the 
Islands.  
2.50. The situation at the time of the accident is shown  on the synopt ic chart in Appendix 
3. This cover ed the period from midday when the flight planning started to after their 
departure.  
2.51. The operator had found from experience that standard aviation weather forecast 
information was not reliable for the Southern Ocean. They obtained their own 
weather information from several different but well-known  sources, including the 
automatic weather station ( AWS ) on Enderby Island , then made th eir own 
assessment . In this case, they were aware of the cold front approaching  Auckland 
Islands and had planned to arrive before it and weather out the night on the ground.  
The medivac would take place the next morning on 23 April and the return flight 
north back to Invercargill would be in the clearer air behind the cold front.  
2.52. The sun set at Auckland Islands at 1757 that day and civil twilight ended at 1831. The 
moon phase  was in its third day after full moon  with 94 per cent illumination (in 
relation to full moon at 100 per cent) . The moon  was still below the horizon at the 
time of the accident  and rose at 1949  (Timeanddate.com, 2022) . The predicted night 
illumination levels at Auckland Island for the time of arrival was not available to the 
pilot. Subsequent research found that the illumination level was at its minimum at the 
time of arrival  (see Tests and research ).  
2.53. The record from the MetService AWS at Enderby  Island  showed that for at least 20 
hours prior to the accident the temperature and dew point were less than 1°C apart 
at about 11 °C. This had resulted in  a steady relative humidity of between 97 per cent 
 
12 The accident occurred at 1937 on 22 April .

 and 99 percent.  The wind at the time of the accident was trending from 290 degrees 
through to 310 degrees True and was steady near 11 knots with maximum gust s to 
18 knots . The pressure was  steady at  1022 hectopascals  and it was not raining . This 
AWS does not measure cloud base or record video.  
Communic ations and aids to navigation  
2.54. The helicopter  had VHF communications through the operator's repeater network 
and the Airways aviat ion infrastructure.  The coverage did not extend for the full flight 
distance. The helicopter was also fitted with a satellite phone for communications 
outside normal radio coverage.  
2.55. The pilot used a Garmin 296 GPS with map display to navigate.  
Recorded data  
2.56. The helicopter was fitted with a TracPlus , satellite -based , flight following system . This 
system report ed the helicopter 's GPS position  and height every minute  to a computer 
server via the Iridium satellite network . The operator connected to the server  to 
monitor the helicopter's progress . The last reported position was less than a minute 
before the accident  and was made available for the search and rescue efforts . The 
Commission obtained recent records of the helicopter 's flight track s for this  
investigation . 
2.57. The helicopter was also fitted with a Garm in 296 GPS with moving map display. This 
unit was recovered with the helicopter and transported to the Commission's 
laboratory in Wellington. The unit was dried and cleaned,  and the memory chip 
removed and connected to a chip reader. The GPS flight track14 was recovered from 
the memory chip . The data records covered the entire flight at a sample rate of 
between one and 20 seconds,  including six points after the last known position from 
the TracPlus  (see Figure 4). 
Site and wreckage information  
Flight path  
2.58. The he licopter's flight path data from the GPS and the flight tracking system  is 
presented in Figure 4. The orange points are from the Trac Plus logged at 1 minute  
intervals and the blue points from the GPS logged  at less than 10 second  intervals  
(varies depending on GPS operating firmware ). The GPS derived altitude at several 
points is marked in Figure  4. The last reported position on TracPlus was at just over 
800 feet near Ewing Isl and, about one minute before the accident.  
Wreckage  
2.59. The wreckage had been lying on the sea floor for 18 days  and sustained additional 
dama ge during that time. The sea floor was rocky with rough gravel and coarse  sand 
and covered with a light kelp forest .

   2.60. The helicopter had been upside down, firmly  resting on the sea floor,  but able to 
sway  with the water currents . The tail boom and tail rotor assembly had separated  
from the main body of the helicopter  and drifted away . They were not recovered,  but 
were sti ll attached immediately after the accident  (as see n in Figure 3Error! 
Reference source not found. ). The left-hand  sliding cargo door detached during the 
accident. It was  found floating on the surface by a search vessel several nautical miles 
south , retrieved , and then returned when the  vessel  next berthed in New Zealand.  The 
emergency exit window  was sti ll in place  and had not been opened . 
2.61. The transmission and rotor head assembly and the remains of the main rotor blade s 
attached to the rotor hea d had separated  on impact . The transmission and rotor head 
assembly dropped about 20 -30 metres away from the mai n wreckage . Three  of the 
main rotor blade  stubs  had been ground down  by abrasive movement with the sea 
floor . The splintered stub of the other one remained  (see Figure 6). The main rotor 
blades were not retrieved.  The pitch links had snapped at one end . The drive link 
attachment bolts  to the rotor head had sheared  and the drive link was distorted . 
2.62. The panels around the nose, front windows and instrument mountings were 
damaged by water impact. The cockpit floor had been forced upwards slightly and  
pivoted around a point in the floor where the front cross -brace for the skid 
penetrates, back towards the rear of t he front door frame at station 320015 (see 
Figure 5). Some instruments had slid aft in their panel mounting very likely  due to 
the impact -induced  water pressure in the nose area  behind them  (see Figure 7). 
2.63. Damage to  the wreckage was consistent with  the helicopter impact ing the water at 
speed , with the power on , and in a shallow angle of descent with a slight right -hand  
bank.  The helicopter would have tipped forward until the main rotor blades contacted 
the water. This action would have rotated the helicopter fuselage up and around and 
then hard down onto the left-hand  side. The transmission and rotor head  and the two 
left-hand doors  would likely  have departed during this stage of the impact.

Survival aspects  
2.64. The crew were wearing immersion suits and helmets. The suits kept them warm in the 
cold water (about 10 °C) and provided sufficient flotation for them not to activate 
their inflatable life -jackets.  
2.65. The helicopter flipped end -for-end and lay partially subme rged for a short period of 
time. The co ckpit was underwater, but the rear cabin was only partially under. The 
front crew were restrained to some extent by their harnesses . Both made their way 
out of the  helicopter from underwater. All crew were trained and  experienced in the 
techniques of escaping from a helicopter while u nderwater.16 
2.66. The winch operator was sitting in the cabin  sideways  to the direction of impact  with 
their back to the left side and seated just aft of the sliding door opening. Their seat 
was a standard KHI  high-density , three -person  seat running along the side wall of the 
cabin. The seats  were designed to withstand forces of 4  G (front, back, left and right), 
1.5 G (upward ) and 8 G (downwar d) with up to three persons  weighing 80 kilograms.  
Each seat had a four -point harness with central quick release.17 The load capacity of 
the seat belts was 6.865 kN  and the snap -on bracket was 15 kN. The winch operator's 
left-hand seat belt snap -on steel bracket broke in overload  where it attached to the 
seat base (see Figure 8) .  
2.67. The winch operator was flung forward and knocked unconscious.  The sliding door 
detached  in the accident sequence . The paramedic evacuated from the front left seat , 
and found  the winch operator floating on their back  in the cargo cabin  and dragged 
them out of the helicopter.  
 
16 Known as HUET .  
17 The seat belt harnesses were replaced in accordance with Supplemental Type Certificate 5/21E /29 issued to 
National Aircraft Interiors Ltd, Nelson .

   2.68. A four-person life -raft was in the helicopter,  but proved difficult to identify in the 
darkness and was  not retrieved before it sank.  The approved  life-raft was an EAM -T4 
type18 manufactured in accordance with FAA TSO -C70a , Type II .19 It was lying in 
amongst other cargo in a standard EAM container  coloured 'International Y ellow '.   
2.69. The crew had emergency PLBs and other emergency gear in a grab -bag in the ba ck 
cabin of the helicopter.  It was not found before the helicopter sank. They did not 
have any emergency items on their person,  except one crew member had a 
pocketknife  and torch . 
 
Night vision i maging systems (NVIS)  
2.70. An NVIS collectively refers to each of the elements that are required to safely operate 
an aircraft using NVGs. In addition to the NVG unit itself, NVIS elements include the 
following:  
• Components on board the aircraft to support the use of NVG s, such as 
compatible lighting systems , external illumination lighting , and radio 
altimeters to indicate clearance height from the surface . 
• Operational procedures, including flight planning and risk management to 
ensure NVG flights are conducted when environmental condi tions are 
suitab le (eg, not less than VFR meteorological  minima  and illumination 
criteria) . 
• Training, competency and currency requirements for personnel using 
NVGs .  
 
18 EAM is the manufacturer Eastern Aero Marine . 
19 This is the FAA Technical Standard Order that specifies the minimum performance standards for this type of 
life-raft.

<< Page 17 >>
 • Airworthiness (maintenance) requirements for both the aircraft 
components and NVG equipment, including pre -flight procedures to 
ensure functionality.  
2.71. NVG use enhances a pilot's  ability to operate in dark and low -light conditions by 
receiving and intensifying ambient light, resulting in an amplified light image that is 
presented to the e ye (Parush, 2011) . The intensifier tube section of NVGs has a 
maximum respon se within the i nfrared light range that is not visible to the human 
eye. The amplified electron stream generated within the intensifier tube is  then 
focused onto a phosphor screen,  which reproduces the image in shades of green 
light that is visible to the eye . (The recent option  of white phosphor offers some 
improvement in clarity) .  
2.72. The device is head -mounted and self -contained by way of a battery pack that is 
positioned at the rear of the head to counter the weight of the goggles sitting over 
the operator's eyes  (see Figure 9). Additional weights can be added inside the battery 
pack to balance for individuals.  Used correctly, in most conditions NVGs provide a 
pilot with a significantly enhanced means of distinguishing the horizon, objects, 
terrain  and weather when compared to unaided night vision.  
2.73. Advancements in NVG technology have improved both physical comfort and image 
quality compared to earlier generation models. There are, however, inherent 
limitations associated with NVGs. These include:  
• Visual acuity: This is related to the luminance of the NVG screen , which 
varies as a function of the ambient light (eg, full moon versus overcast 
starlight). NVG -assisted acuity declines with decreasing celestial 
illumination. Acuity is also related to targ et contrast and deteriorates more 
rapidly for low -contrast items when illuminance levels decline.   
• Monochromatic image: Colour differences between components in a 
scene aids recognition of objects and discriminating between them, as 
well as assists with d epth perception and distance estimation. The lack of 
colour variation in the NVG image (shades of white or green) degrades 
these capabilities to varying degrees.  
• Limited field of view (FOV): In normal vision, an unaided FOV covers an 
elliptical area of app roximately 120 degrees laterally and 80 degrees 
vertically. This is reduced to around a 40 -degree circular area when 
wearing NVGs, significantly reducing peripheral vision in particular.20 
• Physiological implications: While NVG units and helmets are adjust able to 
an individual , muscle fatigue, neck strain and headaches can occur , 
particularly with prolonged use.  They can also conflict with other apparel 
such as flying jackets, immersion suits and life -jackets.  
2.74. NVG image quality is variable, depending on the operating environment, atmospheric 
conditions and the degree of illumination . All NVGs require some illumination of the 
subject and reflectance of that illuminance back to the NVG lens to produce an 
image. For example, light rain or mist is generall y not as easily perceived when 
compared to dense clouds and large rain droplets, but will affect contrast, distance 
estimation and depth perception. Featureless terrain (such as large bodies of water) 
 
20 While FOV is limited, because NVGs are helmet -mounted the user can move their head to scan a wider area. 
The total area that can physic ally be scanned is called field of regard (FOR) and is mainly dependent on the 
physiology of head movement and cockpit design ( eg, seat location, blind spots etc).  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 18 >>
   have a distinct lack of contrast, particularly when the re are no distinguishable white 
caps or enough surface disturbance to reflect light  back to the NVG observer  (CASA, 
2022) . 
 
2.75. Illumination can be either artificially or naturally acquired. The moon provides the 
greatest source of illumination, and both the phase and elevation will determine ho w 
much moonlight will be available. Lunar illumination is expressed in percentages (100 
per cent illumination being a full moon) . Information about illumination levels can be 
obtained from  the moon data  in the 'Time and Date ' website  (Timeanddate.com, 
2022)  or through a dedicated software package such as Met Office Night Illumination 
Model (MONIM) from the UK Met Office.  Sky glow21 also contributes to natural 
lighting levels and is dependent on latitude and the time of year. Cultural lighting , or 
the artificial lighting sources common with  human habitation , also contributes to 
night illumination.  
2.76. Due to the many possible combination s of the variables that will affect image quality, 
NVG users require techniques to help interpret images in different circumstances. 
Such techniques include an understanding of how to use terrain features ,22 to aid 
visual recognition and the ability to det ermine distance information, depth 
perception and closure rates. Given that NVIS operations take place at night (albeit 
with better visual acuity than unaided night operations ), the limitations associated 
with NVG use means that pilots and crew are still s usceptible to the visual illusions 
typical of night VFR  that can affect loss of a reference horizon .    
 
21 Effects of solar light present in the sky until the sun is approximately 18 degrees below the horizon.  
22 This includes cues such as object size, shape, contrast and shadows.

 Night vision goggle (NVG) helicopter operations  
Aviation rules  
2.77. There are currently no CARs regulating  the equipment or conditions of use of NVGs 
during flight within New Zealand. Instead, information about the standards, practices 
and procedures for the safe use of NVGs is provided by way of a n Advisory Circular 
(AC), AC91 -13 Night Vision Imaging Systems - Helicopter.23 The CAA formalise NVIS 
operations through the ir approval process for issuing  an operator's AOC.   
2.78. The AC states that it relates to helicopter operations conducted under CAR Parts 91, 
119 and 135 . All references to rules are from within the AC (eg, the content of an 
AOC, equi pment standards and  maintenance requirements). The rules do not make 
any cross -reference back to the AC  or mention the terms NVIS or NVG . At the time of 
the accident, AC91 -13 had undergone one revision  and this was effective as of 20 
June 2011  (CAA, 2011) . The initial issue date was not published.  
2.79. The AC includes  information on the acceptable technical standards for a n NVIS and 
the associated aircraft installations . It also  provides guidance for appropriate operator 
procedures, training programmes, pilot competency and currency requirements, and 
the maintenance requirements to safely utilise NVGs during night VFR flight  in 
helicopters.  
2.80. Each operator who wishes to use NVIS is expected to define their own NVG operating 
procedures , which they may base on the AC  or not. The AC list s three Radio Technical 
Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) documents that formed the foundation of civil 
NVG operations in the USA and Europe and would be acceptable to CAA for use in 
New Zealand.  
2.81. This operator had integrated the requirements of AC91 -13 in to their exposition . 
2.82. Similarly, there were  no CARs  covering  Helicopter Air Ambulance ( HAA)24 operations 
within New Zealand. The CAA  clarified this by stating that:  
There are no specific Civil Aviation Rules (CARs) for Helicopter Emergency 
Medical Services (HEMS) operations. However, all operators that engage in 
HEMS operations operate in accordance with CAR Pt 119, CAR Pt 135, CAR Pt 91 
and CAR Pt 133.  
Equipment requirements  
2.83. The primary helicopter equipment required for NVIS is an internal and external 
lighting system, both of which must be specifically compatible for NVG use. 
Installation of a n NVIS into a helicopter is deemed to be a 'major modification' and 
must include a Flight Manual Supplement. For the holder of an AOC, evidence of a n 
NVIS compatibility inspection is recorded on the Operations Spec ification  and it 
expires after two ye ars.  
2.84. The helicopter  was listed on the operator's AOC and the NVIS inspection was current 
to 20 December 2020.  
2.85. The AC adopts the FAA standards referred to in FAA AC27 -1B with differences for 
New Zealan d. The AC also lists a ncillary equipment for an NVIS  equipped helicopter 
 
23 The AC was developed as a means of facilitating the introduction of NVIS into the New Zealand civil aviation 
environment and draws extensively on documentation from the R TCA and the FAA.  
24 This term is preferred to HEMS by the FAA and has been adopted for this report.

   as being: a radio altimeter,25 skid/slip indicator, gyroscopic attitude indicator, 
gyroscopic direction indicator or equivalent, and vertical speed indicator. Given the 
reduced FOV a pilot has when 'goggled up', these instruments are required to be 
positioned in such a way so as to reduce the amount of head movement required to 
view them and therefore minimise the potential for spatial disorientation.  Instruments 
and cockpit displays must be capable of being viewed with unaided vis ion (ie,  for the 
crew to look at them under neath  their NVG s).   
2.86. The radio altimeter fitted  to the helicopter had a maximum range of 2500 feet  and 
single display in the pilot's instrument console . The pilot co uld select the height 
setting  bug to any height under the maximum range  and a visual alert would 
illuminate while the helicopter was less than that  height  from  the surface . It did not 
have an audio alert  function  (See Glossary for altimetry) .  
NVIS pilots  
2.87. The recommended requirements for pilots wishing to become certified for  NVG use 
are described  in AC 91-13 under NVIS Pilot Prerequisites.  The minimum licence 
requirement is a private pilot licence (PPL), but the flight experience and performance 
parameters are broadly based on those that are required for the issue of a CPL wi th a 
night endorsement. This includes the ability to demonstrate instrument flight 
proficiency , and the AC notes the following:  
…the emphasis is for a pilot flying night VFR utilising NVIS to obtain, and 
maintain, proficiency in instrument flying skills. It is recommended, but not 
essential for the pilot to hold an instrument rating. The holder of an instrument 
rating will be better placed to cope with the night VFR/NVIS environment.  
2.88. Pilots must complete an approved NVIS ground training course with a minim um 
syllabus outlined in the AC . Generic topics include aeromedical, NVG theory, 
interpretation of NVG imaging, environmental factors and NVIS flight planning. 
Operator -specific training is also covered , as is aircraft ground training for 
familiarisation of NVIS equipment on the helicopter. There are no recommended 
teaching times specified for any of the subject matter.  
2.89. A minimum of five hours of approved NVIS flight training is required. Once a pilot has  
passed their initial flight check, their logbook will be certified with a night flight 
endorsement to use NVIS.  
2.90. NVIS currency requirements include recency of NVIS experience  and an annual 
proficiency check with a n NVIS certified flight instructor or exami ner. The AC refers to 
CAR 61.37 Recent Flight Experience , which  defines that to remain current a pilot must 
complete at least three take -offs and landings at night within the last 90  days.  
2.91. Recurrent training consisting of the initial flight check sylla bus and selected elements 
of the initial ground theory course is required to be conducted on an annual basis. 
The proficiency check must represent a typical NVG flight operation and include 
demonstration of the ability to cope with both a NVG malfunction a nd recovery from 
inadvertent IMC26 penetration.  
 
25 An electronic device capable of measuring the height of an aircraft above the terrain immediately below it. The 
radio (or radar ) altimeter is independent from the barometric altimeter system .  
26 Instrument meteorological conditions (or visibility has redu ced to an extent that visual reference of the horizon 
is lost) . 
 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 21 >>
 2.92. CAR 61.29 describes the requirements for pilots to record their flight time in their 
logbook . There is no requirement to differentiate between VFR night flight and NVIS 
night flight using NVGs.  
NVIS crew members  
2.93. In addition to the minimum requirement of having at least one NVIS trained pilot 
when operating with NVGs , the AC allows an  operator to utilise  a second trained 
NVIS crew member when considered necessary for safe operations.  
2.94. The AC  defines a n NVIS flight crew member as being a trained crew member who is 
required to perform essential inflight duties to ensure safe operation of the aircraft 
during NVG flight operations.  
2.95. A crew member may be a second NVIS trained pilot, but this is not a requirement. 
According to NVIS Crew Member Training Prerequisites  in the AC , the minimum 
qualification and experience for a person wishing to become a n NVIS crew mem ber 
are only those specified by the operator and documented within their exposition.  
2.96. To become a certified NVIS crew member, individuals must complete the same NVG 
ground theory syllabus as pilots. Once completed, a crew member must undertake a 
minimum of two hours of NVIS flight training and checking with an approved 
organisation.27 The flight training syllabus covers selected elements of the more 
extensive syllabus for pilots, specifically preparation, emergency procedures, CRM 
and post -flight procedures.  Any special procedures specific to the type of operation 
(eg, winch training) must also be covered.   
2.97. Once a helicopter crew member has been endorsed as a qualified NVIS crew member, 
this is acknowledged by way of a certificate,28 which is to be retained in the operator's 
files. Crew are not to act as a n NVIS crew member unless they have either completed 
three NVG flights in the preceding 120 days or  have completed their initial or 
recurrent training within that time. Recurrent training consisting of the initial flight 
check syllabus and selected elements of the initial ground theory course is required 
to be conducted annually . 
2.98. Each operator must ensur e that crew members are trained and competent to perform 
their assigned duties.29 Section 3.2.1 NVIS Crew Member  of the AC  states  the 
following about  the duties a crew member is expected to perform as part of a n NVIS 
operation:   
An NVIS crew member needs t o - Participate in crew briefings prior to each shift 
to: 
• become familiar with the general weather conditions  
• confirm that the NVIS equipment has been pre -flight checked  
• know any restrictions to NVIS flight operations; and  
• participate in crew briefings pri or to a NVG flight operation to:  
 
27 A Part 141 certified training organisation or an air operator certified in accordance with Part 119 provided the 
certification authori ses NVIS training and checking.  
28 As NVIS crew members a re not required to be pilots, a certificate takes the place of a logbook endorsement.  
29 In accordance with Subpart I ( Training ) CAR Part 135 . 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 22 >>
   o obtain a general knowledge of the weather conditions along the 
route of the flight  
o obtain a general knowledge about obstacles and significant 
terrain along the route of flight; and  
• during a NVG flight operation:  
o use crew resource management principles to maintain crew 
situational awareness; and  
o maintain appropriate cockpit and other aircraft lighting 
discipline.  
Risk management for NVIS operations  
2.99. As part of NVIS operations, the AC recommends an operational risk asses sment be 
performed before any NVG flight,30 with at least the following points  being 
considered :    
• Illumination level of the flight environment . 
• Forecast and reported weather conditions along the intended route and 
at the intended destination.  
• Recency of experience for pilot and crew.  
• Crew composition.  
• Operator/crew experience with NVG flight operations.  
• PIC field of regard.  
• PIC/crew rest condition and health.  
• Aircraft serviceability (MEL & Tech Log).  
• Windshield/window condition.  
• NVG tube perfor mance/battery condition.  
• Types of operation allowed and applicable standard operating 
procedures.  
• External lighting environment.  
 
2.100.  The operational risk assessment is covered as part of the Preparation  component of 
the flight training syllabus for pilots. It is also taught during the NVIS Flight Planning  
component of the ground theory syllabus and is a selected element required to be 
repeated during ground theory recurrency.  
Tests and research  
2.101.  The illum ination level at Auckland Islands at the time of arrival could be predicted. 
One method was to use a software product available from the United Kingdom (UK)  
Met Office , but there is also information published on public websites.  
2.102.  The UK Met Office was conta cted by the Commission  to obtain an illumination 
prediction for Auckland Islands around the time of the planned medivac flight arrival.

 They used their product MONIM ,31 which supersedes their previous versions called 
'Night Illumination ' as used by the RNZ AF. The UK Met Office provided a graph of the 
predicted night illumination at Auckland Islands , which showed that the natural 
illumination was least at about 1930  (see Appendix 4 ). At that time, it was predicted 
to be about 0.3 millilux. It would rise to over 10 millilux after 2200 , but actual 
illumination was still dependent on cloud cover, so could be less.  
2.103.  Illumination of one lux (1000  millilux) is that of a candle projected onto a flat surface 
1 metre  square at 1 metre distance from the candle. A typical level of illumination on 
the ground at night from a full moon is about 300 millilux , which drops to about 1 
millilux when the moon is below the horizon.  
Previous occurrences  
2.104.  Some previous occurrences with relevant conditions are described below.  
2.105.  New Zealand, 17 December 2020, CAA inci dent 20/6775 , BK117 B -2, Gowan bridge . 
During a patient transfer at night using NVGs  in a single -pilot VFR operation the pilot 
lost spatial orientation . The NVIS crew member , who had by chance decided to sit in 
the front left seat , assisted the pilo t to recover and land . There were four people on 
board with no injuries . The CAA's investigation concluded tha t the contributing  
factors were the pilot's unfamiliarity with that helicopter, a distracting source of light , 
very low natural illuminance, and a higher-than-usual mental workload  maintaining 
visual reference with traffic on a road .  
2.106.  USA, 10 December 2015, NTSB WPR16FA037, Bell 407, McFarland, California. An HAA 
flight was on a patient transfer VFR operation at ni ght using NVGs. The helicopter 
began to descend and then entered a left descending turn. The ground speeds were 
fluctuating, and the descent rate was about 2210 ft/min until impact. There were four 
fatalities. Conditions at the time were likely to include fog and rain. The pilot had an 
instrument rating, but with only 2.3 hours on NVGs in the last seven months before 
the accident and 11 hours on the helicopter. The National Transportation Safety 
Board ( NTSB ) investigation concluded that the  probable cause w as that the pilot lost 
control while attempting a course reversal after inadvertently entering an area of 
reduced visibility. The pilot's lack of recent NVG experience was considered to have 
contributed.  
2.107.  Baltic Sea , 28 February 2014 , BFU 3x006 -14, BK117 C -1, 3 nm north of Prerow. During 
VFR night -hoist training with two pilots (both Airline Transport Pilot Licence  (ATLP)  
holders) the helicopter collided with the sea  with three fatalities and one survivor. The 
pilots were not using NVGs . The German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident 
Investigation32 BFU investigation concluded that the contributing factor s included:  
lack of experience with this type of operation, airspeed and rate of descent were not 
stabilised , insufficient monitoring o f instruments , loss of situational awareness in 
combination with loss of control , and non-reaction to visual and audio altitude 
warnings on the radio altimeter.

   fatalities. Pilot was using NVGs and a non -NVG spotlight to illuminate the ground. It 
was a 0 per cent moonlit night with very little cultural lighting and low contrast. The 
pilot had recently completed training with NVGs, but it had been on nights with more 
moonlight.  The NTSB investigation concluded tha t the probable cause was the pilot's  
loss of situational awareness due to unfamiliarity with the hazards of low -contrast 
area while using NVGs.   
Organisational information  
2.109.  The operator's exposition defined their authorised  operations as Part 135 air 
transport and CTOs in New Zealand and Antar ctica that included VFR day and night 
and NVG flight operations. The operator had also been approved to conduct CTOs  
beyond the New Zealand flight information region (NZFIR)  over the previous 20 
years.  
2.110.  Helicopters operated by the company included eight on the company register and six 
leased. The types operated included BK117, AS 350 , R44 and EC120.  
Emergency l ocator t ransmitter  
2.111.  The helicopter was fitted with an emergency locator transm itter (ELT) model Artex 
C406 -1HM. The ELT is designed to activate automatically on detection of impact G -
forces more than 2.3 G in the forward  direction of crash impact and 12 .5 G in the 
other five perpendicular axes (rear, left, right, up and down ). Units  made after 2019 
have a sensor with a lower threshold of 6 G to 8 G . It would then start transmitting  an 
emergency signal within the next 60 seconds. The unit is mounted at the base of the 
tail boom and the antenna on the cabin roof.  It will transmit a low -power amplitude 
modulated signal on 121.5 and 243 MHz and a digital signal burst on 406 .025 MHz.  
2.112.  No alert signal was received from the ELT by the RCCNZ . 
2.113.  Weak signals were occasionally detected by the  searching  RNZAF Orion aircraft on 
406.125  Mhz and suspected to be from the ELT, but a location fix could not be 
obtained.  This was approximately 12 hours after the accident . The helicopter had 
sunk and was lying upside down on the sea floor at the time at a depth of about 15 
metres.  
2.114.  The manufacturer believed it unlikely  that the ELT would have radiated a signal from 
the antenna while underwater.  
2.115.  The crew had PLBs on board  in a gra b-bag, but they were lost when the helicopter 
sank.

 3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1. The operator regula rly flew helicopter operations in the Southern Ocean down to 
Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands  so had established a procedure with remote 
accommodation and fuel replenishment facilities . This flight was similar  in that it was 
a long-distance  positioning flight over water to a remote base where they would 
conduct shorter local flights . At the completion of the local flights , they would 
prepare and conduct  the long return flight . The helicopter's GPS navigation system 
already had t he waypoints and local landmarks stored in its database for these 
Southern Ocean flights . 
3.2. The pilot had appropriate flight experience with the operator, including meeting the 
minimum recency with NVGs and the required company authorisations to conduct 
this flight . They had also flown the route once before  in daylight . 
3.3. The pilot and crew members were trained and proficient in underwater escape 
techniques from a submerged helicopter and they were wearing full immersion suits. 
These safety considerations kept the crew  alive and buoyant  in the co ld water.  
3.4. The following section describes what happened and then analyses the circumstances 
surrounding the event to identify those factors that increased the likelihood of the 
event occurring or increased the severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety 
issues that have the potential to adversely affect future operations. Safety issues that 
influenced th is accident were identi fied as:  
• Single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean . 
• Regulatory void for NVIS and air ambulance operations . 
• CRM training in helicopters . 
3.5. Lastly,  two safety issue s regarding helicopter loading and survival equipment are  
explained. These safety issu es were  identified during the investigation as safety 
factors that increased risk, but were  not consider ed to have had a causal effect on the 
accident. However, they are regarded as safety issues because of their systemic 
nature and risk to other helicopter operations.  
What happened  
3.6. The impact forces and damage to the nose area showed that the helicopter had 
impacted the sea at a shallow angle , but at a speed  that was consistent with the 
crew's accounts . Post-accident inspection of t he helicopter, supported by interviews 
of the crew, showed that the helicopter was operating normally with the main rotors 
being driven by the engines when they were suddenly stopped by impact with the 
water. It was also determined that the helicopter had  sufficient fuel remaining to 
safely land.  
3.7. The helicopter arrived at Auckland Islands after dark at about 1930  and the pilot was 
using NVGs , as was the paramedic who was acting as NVIS crew member for the 
flight . The islands are uninhabited  so had no artificial lighting  to assist the NVG 
illumination. The only illumination was from the celestial night sky,  but that was 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 26 >>
   limited by local cloud and atmospheric conditions . The moon had not risen by this 
time and the predicted night -time illumination was at  its lowest level for the night.  
3.8. Both the pilot and NVIS crew member said they saw the hills as they approached 
Auckland Islands and a cloud layer  over the landing area  with an opening wedge 
from the northwest . The pilot recalled seeing the outline of Por t Ross and part of 
Enderby Island.  They also both recall ed seeing the cliffs a few seconds before the 
accident. The winch operator in the rear cabin did not have NVGs on and recalled 
that it was too dark to see outside.  This shows that the NVGs were functioning and 
complementing  the front seat crew's night  vision at the time of the accident.  They 
also recalled that after the accident, while swimming  around the helicopter and 
recovering items  from the wreckage , there was s ufficient ambient light for them to 
see the cliffs 100 metres away with unaided vision.  
3.9. The pilot saw cloud that covered the landing point and a very dark area adjacent that 
they interpreted to have been clear of cloud.  The pilot expressed this opinion to the 
NVIS crew member  who accepted that explanation. The cloud was below their current 
altitude of between 1500 and 2000 feet  and was very likely  to have been sea fog. 
The dark area would very likely  have been an absence of reflected light from the 
calm sea surface to the crew.  
3.10. The pilot describe d their intention to the NVIS crew member to descend in the area 
clear of cloud  and then follow the coastline  back towards the landing point. If that 
was not possible, they would head to a higher landing point and camp out the night.  
The GPS had several suitable landing points  saved in memory from previous trips.  The 
pilot said that the coastline  is usually more clearly defined through NVGs due to the 
greater light scatter from the rough surface.  
3.11. The pilot set the radio altimeter  reference to 1000  feet and started a descent . 
According to the GPS log , this descent rate from 2000  feet to 1000  feet was slightly 
over 500 ft/min  and at approximately 1 25 knots  (see Appen dix 5 ). The NVIS crew 
member started  to read out the altimeter heights. The pilot did not expect the crew 
member to do this , ask for it , question the source of the information, or stop it.  The 
NVIS crew member was reading from the left-hand  barometric altimeter, which  was 
still set at the reference pressure for their departure at Invercargill. While the local 
QNH33 for Auckland Islands was available  to the operator , this was not provided to 
the pilot . Based on the pressure difference, the barometric altimeter would have been 
displaying  about 50 feet higher than the helicopter actually was above the sea 
surface.   
3.12. After reaching 1000 feet, the  pilot had slowed to about 80 knots  and maintained 
about 900  feet for about three minutes  (see GPS flight record in Appendix 5 ). The 
helicopter was making  a gentle turn from south through west towards a final track to 
the north. The pilot reset the radio altimeter  to 500 feet and continued to descend . 
According to th e GPS , the descent rate was above 1200 ft/min,  which is consistent 
with the pilot's account of descending into the clear area . The NVIS crew member was 
concerned about the descent rate and called out to the pilot to check their "speed ". 
The NVIS crew member was not a pilot, or trained to have any flying capability such 
as the reading  and interpretation of instruments , or trained in the use of correct

Codes are a standard set of three letter codes starting with the letter Q , each with a specific meaning.

<< Page 27 >>
 aviation terminology. The pilot was confused by the call (see paragraph 3.30), but 
happy with the airspeed so carried on.  
3.13. After reaching 500 feet, the pilot reset the radio altimeter  to 250 feet  and continued 
to descend. This height above sea level would have been clear of the local terrain. The 
pilot recalled seeing the radio altimeter alert light illuminate, but said that they did 
not continue to monitor the height .  
3.14. The NVIS crew member was reading out the barometric altitude  as they descended,  
and it became steady at 200 feet  for several calls. The NVIS crew member was also 
looking out and noticed a cliff face directly ahead  that they were closing in on very 
fast. These were the cliffs to the south of Croz ier Point . The  cliffs were 20 metres high 
above the beach (66 feet) and then the land is almost flat  from there  across the 
peninsular  to Port Ross . The NVIS cre w member  immediately alerted  the pilot  who 
also saw the cliffs  and started to flare and bank  right  to avoid hitting them . Without 
any further warning , the helicopter impacted the sea.  
Why did the helicopter impact the sea surface?  
3.15. The Commission found that several factors contributed to this accident. Each of those 
factor s is described below under separate headings.   
Flight p lanning  
3.16. This flight was initially planned to have been completed in daylight.  
3.17. The operator's exposition included helicopter flights deep into the Southern Ocean 
from New Zealand to Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands.  They  also operated 
local flights in  the Antarctic. They had established procedures , remote bases  and the 
infrastructure to support these types of operations.  
3.18. The pilot was experienced in the company's operations in New Zealand , the Antarctic, 
and had flown once before to Auckland Islands.  The pilot had about 73 hours of 
experience flying at night  and met the operator's minimum NVG currency of three 
take-offs and landings within the last 90 days.  They were also current with  their 
knowledge of the company's operational procedures, NVIS competency  and the Part 
135 operations flight crew competency check.   
3.19. The NVIS crew member was trained and current in NVG operations , HUET and CRM . 
They had flown two previous medivac flight s to Auckland Islands with another pilot . 
They had also flown  one local NVG medivac with this pilot from  a Southland site a 
few days before.  The NVIS crew member had just under 200 hours of experience in 
that role on NVGs.  
3.20. The risk profile changed as the day progressed, but the plan remained the same . The 
first step cha nge to the risk profile was due to the delay  in departure while waiting for 
the medical supplies  to arrive . This delay meant that the landing at Enderby Island 
would be at night  and it required the illumination level at the destination to be 
considered,34 along with a night descent procedure over water on NVGs.   
3.21. One of the known risks while using NVGs is the potential loss of contrast that a flat 
calm sea creates. It makes height judgement more difficult and the sea surface may 
 
34 See later at Single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean . 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 28 >>
   not be visible through NVGs. These types of situations are described in AC91 -1335 
and in the operator's exposition36 (See Appendix 6  for the extracted text from the 
Exposition ). It is possible to gain a significant improvement in safety by the NVIS crew 
member contributing to the pilot's situational awareness in a more effective way. This 
is explained later in the section on CRM.   
Pilot had minim al NVG recency  
3.22. The flight was progressing normally as they flew south in daylight. The situation 
changed after night fell and the crew were wearing NVGs. The second  step change in 
risk profile  occurred when the crew realised that the landing point was covered in 
cloud.  
3.23. It was getting near to the maximum duty time for the pilot. The exposition allowed 
for up to 8.5 hours flying in any 11-hour period,  but had no weighting for NVG time . 
AC119 -337 provides examples for flight and duty time and suggests a weighting 
multiplier  of 2.3 for every hour flown on NVGs.  The pilot had completed a short flight 
in the morning  before this operation. It had been  about four hours of flying  since 
they left Te Anau with about three hours of planning and waiting for medical supplies 
before tha t. As there was not enough fuel to return to the mainland , the crew were 
committed to landing somewhere on Auckland Islands.   
3.24. Although the pilot met the minimum requirement to remain current with NVGs , the 
actual logged flight time on NVGs over the last 90 days was less than one hour.  The 
required three take -offs and landings  had been part of two separate flights  that had 
extended into night , and the take -offs and landing s were not needed for the 
opera tions,  but were made after dark to remain current wi th night VFR . The pilot's 
last flight crew competency check on NVGs was conducted four  months before the 
accident flight. Low-level flight over water was not checked in that flight check.  
3.25. CAR 61.29 defines what information pilots must log in their logbooks . It does not 
differentiate between VFR or IFR night flight and night flight using NVGs. It just 
requires a record of flight at night  for both VFR and IFR . The pilot did not record their  
NVG flight  time separately  and some of that total night -time include d an initial night 
VFR rating. T he two separate VFR night flight record s could be merged for any pilot 
and a pilot's logged night flight is therefore ineffective to determine recent fligh t 
experience in either  night VFR or NVG at night .  
3.26. With more currency on NVGs , the pilot may have question ed their impression of a 
dark area beyond the cloud . With a different expectation from the CRM, the NVIS 
crew member may have been more effective  in challenging the pilot's perception. 
They had experienced a low layer of fog about an hour earlier in the flight during 
daylight. At th at time the sea surface state and the wind direction would have been 
visible and may have helped to anticipate conditions at their destination.  
Unstable  descent near the surface  
3.27. The next step change in the risk profile occurred when the pilot made a steep descent 
near the surface  on NVGs  and conti nued below their selected reference height .

 3.28. The exposition38 stated that the maximum descent rate on NVGs was 300  ft/min and 
for pilots to use the radio altimeter  both on descent and while in the area, setting the 
decision height alarm accordingly.  The G PS record showed that the pilot descended 
initially at about 500  ft/min down to 1000 feet above the surface, then at over 1300  
ft/min until just before impact.  
3.29. The last radio altimeter setting was found to have been 250 feet. A controlled descent 
and level off at this height would have allowed the pilot to search for visible ground 
references through the NVGs or use the pilot-controlled  spotlight to assist. The p ilot 
said they set the decision height on the radio altimeter,  but then did not control the 
helicopter to remain above that set height.  The pilot recalled that they were primarily 
looking outside  while noting the NVIS crew member's  calls and judging the 
helicopter 's height using depth perception . When the pilot saw the cliffs, they 
recalled being surprised that the helicopter was lower than expected,  indicating a 
disparity between their situational awareness and the actual position of the 
helicopter.   
3.30. The N VIS crew member became  concerned about the descent rate and attempted to 
challenge  the pilot. However,  the terminology used did not convey that message to 
the pilot. The word "speed" directs a pilot to verify  the aircraft's airspeed (forward 
speed through the air) and they would do this by  looking at the airspeed indicator . To 
draw a pilot's attention to the aircraft's rate of descent, the correct terminology would 
be "descent rate", which is shown on the vertical speed indic ator. The NVIS crew 
member 's training was limited to observing for obstacles during take-off and landing 
and providing direction al clearance information  to the pilot . With more appropriate 
CRM training,39 the NVIS crew member 's assistance could have been more eff ective  
as a risk control.  
3.31. The pilot did not have an instrument rating . Not having an IFR rating  meant they  
were likely  more reliant on external visual references for flight attitude than  referring 
to instruments.  A descent at night on NVGs with minimal celestial lighting required 
more reliance on the radio altimeter and GPS  and familiarity with their use . With the 
reduced FOV through NVGs, i t is also likely  that the pilot was fixated on looking 
outside for ground reference to the detriment of an instrument scan inside . It is 
possible that the descent would have been better controlled if the pilot also had an 
instrument rating and was proficient at switching between visual and instrument 
reference systems.   
3.32. An extra ct below from the Australian CASA Advisory  Circular , Multipart AC  91-13 
(CASA, 2022)  describes scanning procedures while flying with NVGs . Under high 
workload s, CRM  is an effective safety measure  with scanning . The AC  states that for a 
multi -crew environment, coordination of scan responsibilities is vital.

Other factors  
3.33. Two other factors also contributed to this accident  - single -pilot VFR operations into 
the Southern Ocean and CRM. They  are covered later in more detail .  
Single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean  
Safety issue: The operator's procedures for single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean 
were not complete or ade quate at the time of this accident to safely manage the flight.  
3.34. This type of operation carried a significant amount of risk over more common 
medivac operations within the  NZFIR . The helicopter had a normal duration on 
internal tanks  of two hours, but the flight south was beyond that range. Extra fuel had 
to be carried in external pods and the helicopter needed to be refuel led just before 
leaving the NZFIR. Cargo weight was critical with extra gear needed for the helicopter 
winch extraction, patient care , passage over the sea, overnight stay and remote 
refueling . The weight of the cargo was limited by the extra fuel carried and would be 
further constrained with the patient weight on return (see Helicopter loading ). 
3.35. The crew were aware that they would be landing after dark and would be using NVGs 
for the approach and landing to an unlit and uninhabited remote island. They needed 
additional skills and equipment to conduc t this flight and to be current in its use. 
They also needed to assess the weather at the landing point and if they had time to 
reach it while the visibility conditions and illumination levels were still suitable for 
night VFR.  

 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 31 >>
 3.36. At some point along the way  they would reach a decis ion point from where they 
could still return and land safely. A little later they would reach a point where they 
could not return from40 and they would be committed to continuing and landing at 
Auckland Islands. They could see Auckland Islands before th e decision  point and were 
able to visually assess if the weather was suitable to proceed. They also had access 
through their base  support  to weather information from MetService's AWS  located 
on Enderby Island.   
3.37. The operator had c onducted flights into the Southern Ocean before and the situation 
was included in the exposition under 'Offshore air operations for flights beyond the 
NZFIR '. That procedure listed minimum conditions for such flights before they could 
proceed  includi ng: ai rcraft type, minimum height, fuel endurance, weather minima, 
emergency equipment, crew briefing, flight following and HUET training . 
3.38. Another procedure in the exposition  under 'Flights over water ' described the 
requirements for long -range offshore flights. The procedure permitted VFR flights if 
they were less than 100  nm from the shore, but beyond that distance they had to be 
IFR. By using Stewart Island, Snares Island and Auckland Islands, the flight could 
remain within the 100 nm distance limit all the way  to Campbell Islands.  
3.39. The chief pilot and the pilot had discussed the proposed flight before the task was 
approved. The pilot was already authorise d by the operator for long -range offshore 
operations. They had decided that the crew composition, pilot curre ncy, and the risks 
of landing at night at Enderby Island using NVGs were adequately managed and that 
the task should proceed.  
3.40. Pre-flight planning was led by the pilot using the operator's standard flight planning 
mnemonic (GSMEACQ )41 and based on the general content from the exposition . This 
planning procedure was inadequate for an NVG operation and for this long-distance  
flight over water for several reasons.  
• The illumination level at the time of expected arrival was not considered 
and the operator did not have a means of obtaining that information.  The 
operator's exposition describes the extra planning and risk assessment 
procedures required for an NVG operation under  'Overwater Night 
HNVGO42 Operations ' where it stated , "illumination levels to be 
considered".  The requirement is also in  AC91-13 as described in section 2 
of this report under the heading Risk management for NVIS operations .  
• The NVGs were reportedly checked and then packed  away until they were 
donned prior to departure from Invercargill. The check did not discover 
the missing battery pack weights. On the flight down, the pilot's NVG 
battery pack was too light and being pushed up by the rolled hood in 
their immersion suit co llar. The NVIS crew member swapped their heavy 
battery pack with the pilot's light pack to fix that problem. The balance 
weight in the pilot's battery pack had been used by another pilot and not 
replaced.  
• The immersion suits were reportedly checked at Te A nau before 
departure . According to the exposition,43 the pilot should have had flares,

   a PLB and a cut -away knife in their immersion suit, but had none of these.  
Another crew member  had a pocketknife and torch in their immersion 
suit, but none of the crew had a PLB. 
• The helicopter was loaded above the maximum weight limit and a flight 
plan load sheet was not submitted  to the operator's base .  
3.41. The flight would leave the NZFIR within 30 minutes after leaving Inver cargill. The 
operator had their own flight monitoring system in place to arrange flight following, 
weather information, advice , and to initiate search and rescue if that was required.  
3.42. The CAA had placed a restriction on the operator's AOC that did not per mit CTOs 
outside the NZFIR  at the time of this flight . The operator was unaware of this 
limitation and had not been consulted . The CAA had approved the operator for the 
last 20 years to operate beyond the NZFIR. It was later discovered to have been a n 
admi nistrative error by the CAA when the limitation was introduced in a n updated  
AOC dated 28 September 2018. The CAA corrected the error  on 25 February 2020  
with a revised AOC . Consequently, no action was taken against the operator for 
conducting this flight beyond the NZFIR  and outside their current AOC . 
3.43. While t he operator had substantial procedure manuals for major operations, such as 
flying in the Antarctic or when working with the local search and rescue organisation , 
the guidance procedures for this high -risk type of operation was spread across 
several sections of the exposition. Much of the operator's experience had yet to be 
documented .  
3.44. The operator  had started a document called the 'Southern Ocean Safety Plan ' to 
describe all aspects of planning and conducting VFR flights into the Southern Ocean. 
It would eventually provide a comprehensive guide and set the standard required for 
pilots to conduct such flights, but it was in draft form at the time of this accide nt and 
had not been made available to all pilots. The operator later provided a copy of  their 
Southern Ocean Safety Plan dated 1 December 2019 . 
Definition of crew member  
3.45. The definition of a crew member in the CARs  is not without  ambiguity .44 The CAA 
issued  a Legal Information Bulletin  No.4 (LIB 4)  to clarify to operators the CAA's 
interpretation of the term  'crew member' for Part 135 operations. However, LIB 4  
means that a lthough an operator may consider and assign a person to be a 'crew 
member' , including training them appropriately for the role, the CAA might classify 
them differently as a passenger, or a  'passenger performing a task'. This scenario  can 
arise with  paramedic s and wi nch operator s.  
3.46. Furthermore, t he term 'NVIS crew member' is defined in the AC 91-13, but not the 
CARs, creating ambiguity as to whether such a person is a crew member or 
passenger. Questions can also arise as to  whether a n NVIS crew member's role could 
change from being a crew member to a passenger based on their actions  durin g 
flight . For example,  during the flight to Auckland Islands, whether the paramedic was 
a passenger until they donned the NVGs.   
3.47. The Commission considers that the differences in status of persons on board aircraft 
continue s to be a source of confusion  for pilots and operators . 
 
44 The Commission had consider ed the crew status in investigation AO -2018 -005 ( MD600N forced landing at 
Ngamatea Station) .

 Present r egulatory void for NVIS and air ambulance operations  
Safety issue: There are no formal risk controls in New Zealand for helicopter NVIS  or air 
ambulance operations unlike other jurisdictions that have set minimum standards in response 
to the high accident rate in this sector .  
3.48. As described earlier  (See ' Aviation rules '), there is no formal regulation or 
performance  standard for NVIS or for HAA operations in New Zealand.  Presently, the 
CAA can impress a discretionary level of control  through  the CAA's approval process 
for an operator when they apply  to add these types of operations to their AOC.  This 
operator had voluntarily adopted much of the content from the AC 91-13 into their 
operating procedures.  
3.49. The most recent issue of the AC was in 2011 . Activity in the HAA and NVIS  aviation 
sectors in New Zealand has increased  significantly since that time  as it has overseas.  
Trends with overseas regulators have been to increase the requirements for crew 
training, CRM, operational recency , aircraft equipment , and to require pilots to be 
instrument rated.  
3.50. In New Zealand , the lack of formal  regulation or performance standards  for HAA  
operations  remains , but has been somewhat compensated for  by the activities of 
consumer  and interested sector bodies . Ambulance New Zealand and the NZ 
Helicopter Association (a division of Aviation N ew Zealand)  developed a joint 
standard called the 'New Zealand Aeromedical and Air Rescue Standard'  (NZAARS) .45 
This came into use during the early 2000s with its first three -year review being 
completed in December 2012.  All contracted helicopter operators provid ing 
helicopter services to Health New Zealand must comply with this standard and be 
independently audited against it .46 
3.51. The goal of the NZAARS is to ensure the quality of service provided by aeromedical 
services  and air rescue se rvices in New Zealand and that it promotes safety , 
consistency and is patient - or recipient -focused. From an aviation perspective, the 
standard  defines the minimum crew experience for each group47 of aircraft operation, 
the aircraft  type suitable for those  operations, minimum equipment  and crew training 
requirements.  It also sets out criteria for human factors and CRM  that must be part of 
the operator's  wider safety management system  (SMS) .  
3.52. For the NVIS requirements , the NZAARS  defers to the CAA AC91 -13, but also adds 
criteria aimed at recency and refresher training that is greater than required in the AC . 
Radar (radio) altimeters are required for some group operations as minimum 
equipment , but there are no other expectations.  This standard is , in effect, like the 
Basic Aviation Risk Standard s (BARS ) requirements described later under Flight Safety 
Foundation  and fits within the category of a mandated change driven by customers in 
the 'HEMS Industry Risk Profile '.48 
 
45 See the full citation  to access a copy of this standard (Ambulance New Zealand, 2018) . 
46 As this flight was a privately -funded medical evacuation, the NZAARS did not apply . 
47 Helicopter aircraft groups defined in the standard are: Group 1 - IFR multi -engine  turbine for aeromedical and 
SAR; Group 2 - VFR multi -engine  turbine for same as operations as Group 1 ; Group 3 - VFR s ingle engine 
turbine for SAR ; Group 4 - VFR single engine for SAR .

   United States of America  
3.53. In 2006, the NTSB published a special investigation report on emergency medical 
services operations  (NTSB, 2006) . This was after investigating 55 accidents in the HAA 
sector. NVIS was new to civil aviation at the time,  but the report concluded that 
proper use of NVGs could help pilots avoid hazards at night.  
3.54. New Zealand's CARs are structured like those of the FAA, with FAA Part 13549 used for 
CTOs.  The FAA uses OpsSpecs  for specific activities in CTOs  so an operator may have 
Part 135 certification then add other activities to their operating certificate . HAA 
operations were  covered under OpsSpec A021 and NVIS under OPsSpec A050. In 
2014, the FAA revised several rules and  the HAA requirements were shifted to Part 
135, Subpart L. The FAA said about the new rules release that it addressed many of 
the concerns the NTSB had with HAA operations.  
3.55. Two aviation phrases were formalised with the new rules and in FAA documentation. 
The changes were  to: 
• Replace helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) with the term HAA. 
• Discourage the use of the term "mission" because of it s implication of 
acceptable losses in military aviation.  
3.56. In 2017, the FAA instructed that all HAA Pilots -in-Command  (PICs) must have a 
current instrument rating.  
3.57. In 2022, the FAA updated OpsSpec A050 for NVIS operations. One of the changes 
was a significant increase in the NVG recency  requirement for pilots  before they 
could fulfill the role of PIC. The requiremen t for three take -offs and landings in the 
last 90 days  was increased  and the period reduced . The take -offs and landings were 
extended to a full departure , cruise and approach  to land. Area departure and arrivals 
were included and transitions to and from aided flight (using NVGs ). They also 
needed to have completed six NVG operations  in the period to remain current . 
Australia  
3.58. The Civil Aviation Safety A uthority ( CASA ) had issued a simila r advisory document in 
2007 as the New Zealand CAA AC91 -13 with the CASA Civil Aviation  Advisory 
Publication CAAP 174 -01. However, in Australia it  was enforced with Civil Aviation 
Order CAO 82.6.  The process for operators was to use the CAAP 174 -01 as a guide to 
make the necessary changes to their operation procedures  to meet the requirements 
of the CAO and  then to apply to CASA for approval to use NVGs.  
3.59. In 2021, the rules in Australia were change d and now all the requirements for the use 
of NVGs are included within the new rules structure  CASA Part s 61, 133 and 138.  A 
new multi -part manual of standards is out for consultation and the multi -part 
Advisory Circular AC 91-13, AC133 -09, AC138 -06 was issued in 2022  (CASA, 2022) . The 
CAO 8 2.6 and CAAP  174-01 were  repealed .

 European Union and United Kingdom  
3.61. The European Union (EU) Commission Regulation 216/2008 was issued in 2008 to 
provide the common rules  for air operations in each member country. This was 
revised in 2012 with Regulation 965/2012  (European Union, 2012)  that contained 
Specific Approvals  (SPA). The SPAs related to additions to a basic AOC.  
3.62. Subpart J of the 2012 r egulation was the SPA for helicopter emergency medical 
services  called SPA.HEMS.100 . Subpart H was the SPA for helicopter NVIS operations 
called SPA.NVIS.100.  
3.63. A helicopter intended for use at night with NVGs must have a specific airworthiness 
approval for NVIS in accordance with Regulation 1702/2003 . 
3.64. In 2014, the UK CAA issued a Safety Directive (UK CAA, 2014)  that added specific 
requirements to both the EU Commission Regulations for emergency medical services 
and NVIS operations  conducted within UK . This Safety Directive increased the 
minimum requirements for pilots, to only allow single -pilot HEMS to proceed if the 
pilot held a valid  instrument rating.  
Flight Safety Foundation  
3.65. The Fl ight Safety Foundation50 publishes a set of BARS that they provide for guidance 
to aviation sector operators.  In a standard intended for organisations  that contract 
aviation services from air operators is a set of minimum standards for NVIS 
operations  called 'Contracted Aircraft Operations '. 
3.66. Appendix  5 of that BA RS covers NVG operations. It describes the known risks in a 
Bowtie risk model format , with each of the threats and appropriate controls  given . 
The listed threats are: NVG failure, Flight considerations (pre -planning), Helicopter 
compatibility, Flight crew experience, Flight crew recency and General NVG 
considerations.  
3.67. The BARS  has a higher requirement than New Zealand AC91 -13 for: the radio 
altimeter , the minimum crew experience and CRM , and the flight crew recency  of 
experience . 
3.68. In 2009 , the Flight Safety Foundation published an industry risk profile  for helicopter 
emergency medical services (Flight Safety Foundation, 2009) . The profile focuses on 
the voluntary change that the industry sector can control  to manage risk , but 
recogni ses that input from  other participants  in the system may also be required  to 
minimise  that risk. Those other participants are government legislators , regulator y 
bodies  and customer s. The profile lists 26 high-level risks that have been determined 
from HAA industry data and analysis and outlines the appropriate risk treatment 
strategies  to reduc e the risk level.  
Radio altimeter requirements  
3.69. The New Zealand requirement for radio altimeters is in AC91 -13. The AC requires that 
a radio altimeter  is fitted, but the specifications are very general and say that : 
It is recommended that the radar altimeter be equipped with an audio and/or 
visual warning device that can be triggered at a pilot selectable height.

   3.70. The BARS 'Implementation Guidelines ' have a section on helicopter offshore 
operation . It relates mostly to oil rig support helicopter operations with two -pilot 
crew who are  both instrument rated,  but it does indicate the ideal situation  about 
preventing controlled flight into terrain (or water) (CFIT)  through the appropriate use 
of radio altimeters . The standard states at section 21.6 : 
The aircraft operator must document in the Operations Manual or MEL51 a 
requirement for at least one radio altimeter with dual displays, both  of which 
must be serviceable at the time of dispatch for any offshore  flight at night or 
flight conducted under IFR.52 Aircraft operator procedures  should address the 
requirement for setting any aural alerting systems on  the radar altimeter and 
the procedures to be followe d in the event of an  unexpected alert  (Flight Safety 
Foundation, 2014) . 
3.71. A later BARS document in 2021 for offshore helicopter operations safety performance 
requirements  describes  one of the accident prevention  goals for prevent ing CFIT 
accidents as a radio altimeter  with dual displays . The difference from the ir 2014 
standard is that each display should provide  an analogue indication  with a visual alert 
and automated voice alerting device capability.  It emphasises  that the operator must 
have procedures for any user adjustable voice alert features and for actions to be 
taken by the flight crew in the event of an alert (Flight Safety Foundation, 2021) . 
3.72. By having a radio altimeter fitted w ith a visual alert capability, the helicopter complied 
with the recommendation contained within AC91 -13. However, the fact that the AC 
only required either  an aural alert or a visual alert makes it differ from  some overseas 
jurisdictions which require both  forms of alert, including that the visual indication 
(light) is displayed at both crew stations, not just for the PIC.53 Some also require 
separate  altitude displays at those crew stations . 
3.73. From an information -processing perspective, visual cues rely on the visual processing 
channel , and to work they must, in the first instance, be seen. Because FOV is 
significantly restricted when using NVGs, cues that may be readily seen with normal 
periphe ral vision require the pilot to be looking at, or very near to, a particular 
instrument to receive that information. The auditory processing channel, however, 
does not have this limitation since sound is omnidirectional and therefore the 
auditory sense can  receive input from any direction.  
3.74. Despite physiological and ergonomic limitations, the pilot's FOR will, at any time, be 
dependent on their scan technique. This in turn, will be determined by the phase of 
flight and associated workload of the pilot at the  time. During busy periods, where 
attention is required to be distributed across multiple (and potentially complex) tasks, 
pilot scan rates can slow or even become fixated on a particular instrument to the 
detriment of other flight parameters.  
3.75. The increase d demands NVGs place on a pilot's visual system can be assisted by the 
utilisation  of other sensory modes  (Wickens, 2022) .54 In the final stages of the

52 IFR is instrument flight rules .

54 Redundantly coding a target across modalities (such as coupling an aural alert with a visual warning) improv es 
the accuracy of information processing. Auditory stimuli are particularly effective in alerting attention as they 
not only target the auditory processing channel, but they also cue an individual's visual attention. Further, the 
short -term auditory store  (echoic memory) is longer than that for vision meaning individuals can not only 
register the alert , but return to examine/process it after approximately three to six  seconds.

 approach toward Enderby  Island , the pilot was mostly focused on the outside 
environment to navigate visually around the cloud cover and maintain their bearing 
regarding  a suitable landing spot. During the post -accident interview, the pilot 
mentioned that it had been helpful having the crew member call out  the altitude  
readings,55 as their attention was primarily outside of the cockpit at that time.  
3.76. Whether this accident  would have been prevented had the radio altimeter been fitted 
with an aural alert is unknown. It is possible that the pilot may have been more 
conscious of the he licopter's position above the sea surface as the aural alert 
generally encourages more  active engagement with the instrument itself as opposed 
to passive monitoring .56 Potentially, it could also have made the fact that the NVIS 
crew member was calling inco rrect altitudes more readily apparent as there would 
have been a discrepancy between their call -outs and the aural alert sounding.  
3.77. While it cannot be determined to what degree the lack of an aural alerting function 
contributed to this accident, not requir ing what is a well -recognised  safety measure 
for NVIS operations puts the CAA's risk controls out of step with other oversea s 
regulators and NVG operational best practice.  
Summary  
3.78. The introduction of NVIS operations for the commercial helicopter sector wi thin New 
Zealand was intended to improve safety. The lack of a robust regulatory framework to 
support this activity, however, meant that some of the risks associated with NVG use 
were not sufficiently managed. Technical standards and practices used in New 
Zealand for NVIS operations are still based on those common in the early 2000s when 
NVGs were first used in civil aviation. Externally from the regulator , the HAA sector 
has introduced a higher standard for NVIS operators  through contracted HAA 
services with the NZAARS  standard,  but it only applies to selected operators . 
3.79. While the major regulators  in the international community have recognised the 
benefit of NVIS helicopter operations for rescue and air ambulance operations , they 
have also addressed the significant risks by providing appropriate guidance and 
performance expectations. The CAA is still reliant on a non -transparent57 and possibly 
unique individual arrangement they have with each operator through their air 
opera tor certification process.  The international community has advanced 
considerably and the CAA's guidance on NVIS helicopter operations is no longer fit 
for purpose.  
 
55 At the time , the pilot did not know whether the readings were from the barome tric altimeter or the radio 
altimeter .  
56 The aural alert can be cancelled whil e the light would remain on until being reset for a different height.  
57 Two separate operators could have very different conditions  they must meet for CAA through their respect ive 
AOC approval process es.

   CRM training  for helicopter  operations  
Safety issue:  The lack of comprehensive C RM training qualifications for non -pilots acting  as 
crew members, combined with a lack of guidelines on crew members assist ing a pilot during 
NVIS operations, creates an ongoing  risk that helicopter NVIS crews will not have effective CRM.  
CAA rules requirements for CRM  
3.80. CRM is typically defined as the effective use of all the resources available to crew 
members, including each other, to achieve a safe and efficient flight. While CRM falls 
within the broader field of human fact ors, it is considered a specialised  subject 
regarding  training and assessing competency standards as acknowledged in AC121 -4 
The Training and Assessment of Human Factors and Crew Resource Management58 
(CAA, 2013) . 
3.81. Given most two -pilot operations occur within an airline environment, CRM training is 
graduated across the different licensing levels. Within the Private Pilot Licence (PPL) 
Human Factors theory syllabus, a student is simply required to explain how outside 
resources can contribute to the management of a flight. The CPL Human Factors 
theory syllabus builds on this, covering 25 items under the heading s of Social 
Psychology and Flight Deck Management. The theory for ATPL  Human Factors is 
broadly similar to that for the CPL l icensing requirements.  
3.82. Within New Zealand, air operators conducting operations under CAR Part 121 Air 
Operations - Large Aeroplanes  (CAA -1, 2020)  and CAR Part 125 Air Operations - 
Medium Aeroplanes  (CAA -2, 2020)  are required to have programmes in place for CRM 
training and a means by which to assess CRM competency on an ongoing basis as 
part of recurrency/proficiency checks.59 There are no such requirements for 
operations  under CAR Part 135 Air Operations - Helicopters and Small Aeroplanes  
(CAA, 2019) . 
The benefit from CRM in small size aircraft  
3.83. The reason NVIS helicopter operations allow for the utilisation  of a non -pilot crew 
member is to pr ovide additional safety. For this to be achieved, however, both pilot 
and crew member must be highly proficient in all aspects of CRM . The NVIS crew 
member on the accident flight used an incorrect term for "rate of descent"  by calling 
"speed ". A central ten et of CRM is the ability to draw the pilot's attention to flight 
path deviations. If a crew member uses the incorrect terminology, the pilot might  
focus their attention on the incorrect parameter, potentially to the detriment of a 
more critical one - in this case the vertical speed of the helicopter.   
3.84. Effective CRM results in all crew members sharing a common mental model of their 
situation , which  is essential for the pilot to be able to make the best decision(s) with 
the information provided. T o assist in forming a shared mental model of the 
environment, it is imperative all crew members understand from which source flight 
data is being provided. When the NVIS crew member was calling out altitudes during 
the final stages of descent, the pilot as sumed that it was  from the radio altimeter . The 
NVIS crew member would need to have leaned over to read the radio altimeter 
 
58 Part 121 is applicable to Air Operations Large Aeroplanes (seating configuration of more than 30 seats or 
payload capacity of more than 3410  kilograms ). 
59 Competency assessment for 'soft' or non -technical skills such as CRM is significantly complex. Best p ractice, 
such as that encouraged by AC121 -4, requires assessment of individual behavio ural markers by qualified 
examiners trained in specific, well -developed methodologies , including inter -rater reliability.  
 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 39 >>
 accurately. If the information provided was incongruent with the pilot's own mental 
model, it would be  potentially more dangerous th an receiving no information at all 
from that crew member.  
3.85. The ability for flight crew to communicate effectively is critical to flight safety . 
Numerous accidents due to poor communication and misunderstandings on the 
flight deck is the fundamental reason the concept of CRM was developed within the 
airline industry. While CRM programmes - and the associated check -and-training 
components associated with them - are considerably advanced, the requirements to 
implement these within New Zealand are dependent on the particular Part 119 
certificate an operator holds. In the case of a helicopter CTO, there was no CAA rule 
requiring  comprehensive CRM trainin g as required by other multi -crew operations 
under Parts 121 and 125.  
What is the role of a non -pilot crew member during NVIS operations?  
3.86. When interviewed about their duties following the accident, the NVIS crew member 
stated that in addition to their obstacle clearance responsibilities, they liked to call 
out altitude information to pilots, but if a particular pilot didn't necessarily want that 
information, then they did not have to listen. The chief pilot said they were  not clear 
on exactly w hat CRM training a non -pilot crew member would have received, but that 
those who were more familiar with cockpit instrumentation could prove quite helpful 
to the pilot during flight.  
3.87. According to AC91 -13, the purpose of a n NVIS  crew member is to perform "e ssential 
inflight duties to ensure safe operation of the aircraft during NVG operations" and 
that they should "use CRM principles to maintain crew situational awareness". The AC 
does not define what constitutes an essential inflight duty and therefore it i s unclear 
which CRM principles might be applied on board. Potentially, this could include 
reading cockpit instrumentation and providing that information to the pilot for 
situational awareness purposes.   
3.88. While the AC is silent on this role definition, Appendix 1 of the AC  points to an 
operator's exposition  to list the responsibilities and authorities of a n NVIS crew 
member. In doing so, this allows individual operators to define how, and to what 
extent , a non -pilot can interact with the pilo t and participate during safety critical 
phases of flight. In this case the operator 's exposition  allowed a crew member to 
"offer timely suggestions and opinions",  "critique faulty decisions " and " advocate for a 
different position, if necessary, to ensure the safety of the flight ". Whether this could 
include interpretation of flight data from the instrument  panel and verbalisation  of 
those interpretations to the pilot appears ambiguous . However,  evidence would 
suggest that there was certainly variation a mongst different NVIS crew members and 
pilots within the organisation and that expectations were not clearly defined either in 
the exposition  or during pre -flight briefings.  
3.89. Crew members were required to communicate " effectively''  using " standard"  or 
"gene rally accepted " aviation terminology, yet the exposition contained only examples 
of such terminology specific to defined manoeuvres. If this was intended to mean 
that non -pilot crew members were not to offer advice outside of this particular list, 
this was  not clearly specified. Despite this, had the pilot felt that the crew member's 
called heights  were causing an unnecessary distraction or risk, the correct course of 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 40 >>
   action would have been to request that the NVIS crew member to stop. That did not 
occur.  
Who can teach and assess CRM for NVIS operations?  
3.90. The CAA  provides no guidance on how to teach CRM principles  for use with NVIS 
crew, or how practical competency ought to be assessed and graded. For licensing, 
an NVIS flight instructor is o nly required to hold a CPL , and as such may have covered 
only the rudimentary elements of CRM as part of their CPL human factors theory 
course. To then be in a position to not only teach, but also assess , CRM competency 
and standards in a multi -crew enviro nment (including for personnel who are not 
pilots themselves) poses a significant risk to flight safety.  
NVIS requirements for jurisdictions outside of New Zealand  
3.91. New Zealand Civil Aviation requirements to become a n NVIS crew member are 
considerably less rigorous that those required by some other jurisdictions, such as the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) and CASA (see Table 1 below ). AC91 -
13 permits any personnel who are a necessary part of a commercial helicopter 
operation (eg, winch crew, paramedics) to qualify as a n NVIS crew member if they are 
using NVGs to su pport a single -pilot operation. Aside from the NVIS endorsement 
itself, there are no additional requirements to be able to act in this capacity apart 
from what an operator may themselves choose to put in their exposition. Essentially, 
this means that a non -pilot is permitted to occupy a control seat of a helicopter and 
give flight guidance commands to the PIC without the additional training.  
3.92. Table 1 compares the reg ulatory pre -requisites for NVIS flight crew member training 
in three different jurisdictions.

* This includes CRM training, 
checking and assessment as 
specified in AMC1 ORO.FC.115,  
ORO.FC.115  and ORO.FC215.  
Essentially this entails CRM 
training by a qualified CRM 
trainer to the standard 
required for multi -crew airline 
operations, including 
appropriate checking and 
assessment. Should a technical 
crew member not have 
previously received theoretical 
training in human factors to 
the ATPL level, this must also 
be completed as p er Annex I to 
Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011  
 
3.93. As well as requiring more extensive qualifications, the duties that non -pilot crew 
members can partake in during NVIS operations are well defined in CASA and EASA 
legislation. In addition to obstacle clearance d uties, Australia, for example, allows an 
aircrew member to assist with navigation, radio communication, tuning navigational 
aids, helping  with checklist use, and assisting the pilot monitor their systems and 
instrumentation. To do the latter, dedicated training is required to:  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 42 >>
   …adequately recognize, identify, announce, and provide verbal correction (the 
con) to the pilot for drift, rates of climb or descent, obstacle avoidance, and 
ground hazards for example dust and debris  (CASA, 2022) . 
3.94. EASA regulations60 also list the specific duties a HEMS technical crew member can 
fulfil. Like CASA, in addition to the primary task of collision and obstacle avoidance, 
EASA certified crew members can also partak e in the following duties: navigation, 
radio communication and radio navigation aid selection, reading of checklists and 
monitoring of flight parameters. To assist the pilot with flight monitoring, EASA 
regulations61 require a crew member to be trained in instrument flight techniques, 
specifically: instrument scanning, role of instrumentation in NVIS flight, and unusual 
attitude recovery procedures. In addition, one hour of blind cockpit drills must be 
performed.  
Summary  
3.95. Having a non -pilot crew member wearing NVG and assisting the pilot was intended 
to be an additional safety feature that reduced the risk associated with single -pilot 
NVIS operations. For this to be effective, thorough training and a clear expectation 
aroun d the extent of a non -pilot NVIS crew member's duties is required,  but this 
guidance  does not exist  in New Zealand .  
3.96. At the time of this accident, there were no prerequisites to become a n NVIS  crew 
member, the definition of what that role entailed was ambi guous, and the rules did 
not require CRM training to an y defined level of competence .  
3.97. In this case, the accident crew were generally able to work together using the broad 
principles of CRM . However , they did not have the depth of training , or share a 
common  understanding and use of aviation phraseology , to support  the CRM 
techniques required to manage high -risk situations more effectively . 
Helicopter loading  
Safety Issue : The helicopter was loaded above its maximum certified weight limit for the rescue 
flight  and would have further exceeded it on the return flight.  
3.98. This accident is another example of where a helicopter was overloaded, but where 
that action was considered unlikely to have influenced the accident.  The Commission 
has found  in previous accident investigations62 that helicopter s were  loaded above 
the maximum certified weight limits  for the accident flight. The Commission has also 
found that although an operator's procedures may clearly describe what is required , 
and an operato r has provide d the tools to ensure that a helicopter's maximum all up 
weight is not exceeded , pilots routinely violate their procedures .  
3.99. The operator had procedures and quick loading guides to reduce the workload for 
pilots. The guide in Appendix 1  was the applicable quick guide for this flight. It was 
arranged with the percentage of maximum fuel loads and the associated maximum 
cargo loads. The base weight included an allowance for the role equipment. 
 
60 AMC1 SPA.HEMS.130(e) Crew requirements . 
61 GM2 SPA.NVIS.130(f) Crew requirements . 
62 For example,  two recent accidents reported in  TAIC reports  are: AO-2014 -005, Collision with terrain, Mt Alta , 
and AO -2015 -007, Collision with terrain, Fox Glacier , (TAIC, 2014)  and (TAIC, 2015) , respectively . 
 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 43 >>
 Ultimately, the pilot held responsibility to ensur e that the helicopter was not loaded 
above the maximum limits specified  in the type certificate.  
3.100.  Misuse of standard loading guides , or omissions of certain items  or underestimated 
weights  in a loading calculation, may result in an apparent ly acceptable load . It could 
mean the difference between a departure now or a delay  to weigh  items  or leave 
some items behind . If the load is above limits slightly, f uel burn will eventually bring it 
back into normal loading limits. The final test for pilots is often made with a dynamic 
check. This is where the pilot slowly lifts off into a low hover , while check ing that the 
load is not limiting control movement to hold the helicopter level and there is still a 
margin of power available.  
3.101.  The type certificate limits are defined for many reasons and are not necessarily the 
same as the maximum load that can be lifted in the environmental conditions at the 
time. Exceeding the aircraft weight limitations introduces fatigue  that may then 
shorten the operational life of some components. Some helicopter  type certificates  
allow a higher loading if part of the load is external and can be jettisoned  (not 
applicable to the BK117) . Some helicopters also have sufficient power at sea level to 
lift more than the maximum rated internal load. Therefore, a dynamic check will 
establish that the helicopter can be flown, but not if it  is overloaded.  
3.102.  The pilot said that their iBal Rotary  calculation of weight and balance for the accident 
flight was on their phone lost and at sea. They recreated one from memory . The 
recreated loading calculation showed that the he licopter was within weight and 
balance limits,  but it did not match the actual weights . Table 2 below shows the main 
differences  between the pilot's recreated estimate and the calculated loading shown 
in Appendix 2.   
Table 2: Diffe rences in loading estimates  
Item Pilot estimate  Measured or estimate d 
Main fuel  520 kg - 90% capacity  576 kg -100%  capacity  
Extended range tank  162 kg (1 external pod with 
100%  fuel plus an extra 9 kg ) 320 kg (2 external pods with 
100%  fuel in both ) 
Cargo  280 kg 353 kg 
 
3.103.  The medivac configuration loading guide (Appendix 1) showed the maximum load 
that could be carried over the standard role equipment fitted for that configuration 
and remain within  the helicopter's  loading limits . The guide included an allowance of 
100 kilograms for the pilot.  With 100 per cent fuel and two external long-range fuel 
pods , also with 100 pe r cent fuel, this additional discretionary load was 166 kilograms 
of cargo .  
3.104.  The recovered items were weighed and the weight of other  items  not available were 
estimated from discussions with the operator. The calculated helicopter loading is 
given  in Appendix 2  and shows that it was approximately 295 kilograms over the 
maximum allowable weight of 3350 kilograms when the helicopter departed 
Invercargill . It would take approximately one  hour of flight time to burn that excess 
weight  in fuel.  
3.105.  The overload was slightly less at  initial take -off from Te Anau because the winch 
operator was not on board. After the 27 -minute flight to Athol, the fuel burn would 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 44 >>
   have c ompensated for the winch operator boarding so the helicopter would again be 
similar to the take -off weight at Te Anau .   
3.106.  Assuming that all fuel tanks would have been refilled to 100 per cent for the return 
flight  from Auckland Islands , the weight of the me divac patient would have been 
additional to that calculated loading.  
3.107.  The task was at the limits of the helicopter's capability and endurance . With the 
amount of fuel required for the long-distance  flight to Auckland Islands , and the crew 
and equipment carried on board , the flight was only possible by exceeding  the 
maximum certified all -up weight.  
3.108.  The airworthiness and life -cycle of an aircraft structure and its components are 
evaluated by aircraft manufacturers based on operations within the prescribed 
limitations found documented in the Aircraft Flight Manual. Exceeding  aircraft weight 
limitations increases the risk of fatigue failures occurring at a lower life limit or 
inspection interval than that published by the manufacturer . 
Life-raft and survival equipment  
Safety issue: For a  life-raft to be an effective device for increasing the chance of survival in the 
event of a ditching, it must also be easily extracted from the aircraft so it may be deployed 
when needed in an emergency . 
3.109.  The life-raft was a n aviation -style life-raft. Certification under FAA TSO -C70a  meant 
that it had a survival kit inside  with food and other emergency items . As a 'Type II ' 
life-raft it was intended for CTOs , but not for transport category aircraft  (passenger s), 
and it was therefore correctly matched to this type of  operation.  
3.110.  The TSO -C70 includes requirements for the life-raft and container , its colour  and 
marking . The operating instructions must be printed on the outside of the container 
and visible when stowed.  The retaining line  is usually attached to the aircraft to 
prevent the life -raft from floating away . The life -raft pack is then thrown away from 
the aircraft . A survivor must reach the floatin g life -raft pack, lift the cover flap to 
expose  a red handle attached to a lanyard, and pull the red handle until the life -raft 
inflates.  
3.111.  CAR rule 91.525 sets out the requirements for New Zealand air operations over water.  
It states that life preservers, l ife-rafts, signalling devices, ELT(S) and Emergency 
Position -Indicating Radio ( EPIRB ) must be installed in conspicuously identified 
locations and must be easily accessible in the event of an aircraft ditching . Life 
preservers, including constant wear anti -exposure overalls (immersion suits) , must 
meet the requirements set out in Appendix A.14 of CAR Part 91.  
3.112.  In this accident, impact with the water was at night, unexpected  and sudden.  The 
helicopter lay semi -submerged in an inverted attitude for a short period  and then 
sank. The life -raft was loaded into the rear cargo area amongst the rest of the 
provisions for that rescue flight.  After rescuing the winch operator, the paramedic  
tried to extract the life -raft from the cargo area , but could not find it  before the 
helicopter sank.  The crew were wearing full im mersion suits and life -jackets.  
3.113.  The crew had emergency location and communications  devices  in a grab -bag in the 
cargo area , but no t on their person. This grab -bag was also lost with the helicopter.  
 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 45 >>
 3.114.  This raises several safety factors  with over -water operations that operators need to 
address. They must ensure that emergency equipment is available for the crew to use 
in an emergency and that all survival equipment can be used effectively. The safety 
factors include:  
• The type of life-raft that would be most suitable for an operation  
• Where that life-raft (or raft s) will be stowed and how it will be attached  to 
the aircraft  
• If any additional visual aids are required to make a stowed life -raft visible 
in an emergency, such as a water -activated light or highly reflective tape , 
or an activated glowstick  
• What training crew will require and what refresher interval is needed to 
ensure  all crew are familiar with where to find a stowed life -raft and how 
to deploy it  
• What personal survival equipment will be required and where it should be 
stowed.

   4 Findings  
Ngā kiteng a 
4.1. The helicopter was operating normally as the pilot descended to land at  a remote 
island at night . While the pilot was using the GPS map display  for navigation  and 
NVGs to help maintain  visual reference , the helicopter  unexpectedly impacted the 
sea. The pilot had lost vertical reference and controlled the flight into terrain (CFIT). 
4.2. The winch operator's left -hand seat belt snap -on steel bracket  broke in overload 
where it attached to the seat base.  
4.3. The crew's training and skill in helicopter underwater  escape techniques , the wearing 
of flight helmets and full immersion suits , and their survival skills were significant 
factors in their survival from this accident.   
4.4. The helicopter was fitted with an ELT model Artex C406 -1HM , but no alert signal was 
received from the ELT by the RCCNZ.  
4.5. The pilot met the minimum recency  requirement for NVG operations, but was likely  
deceived by a well -documented visual illusion with NVGs caused by  a low contrast 
surface . It is commonly experienced  over calm water  and can affect  judgement of 
height and spatial orientation .   
4.6. The operator's exposition for single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean 
was inadequate at the time to manage the risks associated with such operations.  
4.7. The risk profile for the flight  changed significantly with the delay in departure  time. 
This should have initiated  a thorough operational risk assessment for an NVIS  flight  
operation .    
4.8. The New Zealand CAA risk controls that defin e the minimum safety requirements for 
HAA and NVIS opera tions  significantly lag other jurisdictions and are no longer fit for 
purpose . 
4.9. The aircra ft's rad io altimeter was not required to be fitted with an aural alert ing 
function . This function  provides significant safety protections for pilots wearing NVGs.  
4.10. The potential for CRM to be an effective risk control with non -pilot NVIS crew 
member s in a single -pilot, VFR, Part 135 operation  is undermined by the current rule. 
CAR Pa rt 135 does not set a clear expectation about  the role and duties of a non-
pilot NVIS crew member , or define an appropriate level of CRM competence  that 
could  contribute to the safety of a n NVIS  flight.  
4.11. The CAA requirements for pilots to log flight time did not require a pilot to 
differentiate between night flight and night flight using NVGs.  This makes NVG 
recency experience difficult to assess.  
4.12. The helicopter departed for this flight in an overloaded condition , exceed ing the 
maximum certified weight limit by almost 3 00 kg  (approx imately 9 per cent of 
maximum certified take -off weight ).  
4.13. Although the helicopter and crew were provided with the appropriate emergency 
survival equipment and crew training  for this operation , they we re unable to locate 
some of this equipment , despite it being accessible . The only emergency survival 
equipment that was effective was what they had on their person at the time of the 
accident .

 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1. Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They may not always 
relate to factors directly contributing to the accident or incident . They typically 
describe a system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future transport 
safety .  
5.2. Safety i ssues may be addressed  by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean  
5.3. At the time of this accident, the operator had a draft standard operat ing procedure to 
conduct single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean , but it was not in use . 
The current procedures were spread through the exposition and were inadequate for 
this flight . They pose d an ongoing risk for the operator and flight crew when used to 
conduct Southern Ocean flights.  
5.4. The updated procedure63 has since been provided to the Commission to demonstrate 
the improvements made to safely conduct such operations. The Commission is also 
concerned about the CRM training for non -pilots supporting VFR pilots on NVG 
operations.  
5.5. The appropriate approval pro cess for the draft Southern Ocean standard operating 
procedures and any changes with CRM training or crew allocation on VFR flights into 
the Southern Ocean are for the regulator to decide.  
5.6. The Commission welcomes the safety action to date. However, it beli eves that if the 
operator wishes to continue single -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean, 
their draft procedures need to be approved by CAA for use within their air operating 
certificate .  
5.7. It should also be noted that since this accident, the opera tor has implemented a CAA 
approved safety management system (SMS) in accordance with CAR Part 100. It is 
likely  that their SMS will mitigate the safety factors identified in this report and  
prevent a reoccurrence.  
Regulatory void for NVIS and air ambulance  operations  
5.8. There is no formal requirement  in New Zealand for a minimum safe standard of 
performance for helicopter operations using NVGs or as air ambulance s. The current 
sector co ntrols are defined by each individual operator using an AC as guidance and 
as approved  by CAA  in their respective AOC expositions. This could result in different 
minimum safe  standards of performance by  different operators.  
5.9. HAA and search and rescue operations are of ten conducted at night in marginal 
visual conditions  and, while  not applicable in this accident, under pressure to attend 
 
63 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) - Sub Antarctic Islands , 01 December 2019.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 48 >>
   to a patient 's needs .64 NVGs  are being used more often to assist aircrew to see in 
these marginal VFR conditions.  
5.10. While operators may have developed very sound procedures to manage such 
situations and base them in accordance with international best practice, there is no 
obligation . The threshold is set by an internal CAA review proce ss for each operator 's 
AOC using an outdated Advisory Circular and with no external assurance of 
consistency .  
5.11. Additionally, there is no requirement for pilots to log their night VFR and NVG flight 
time separately , making it difficult to verify actual curr ency in either.  
5.12. While New Zealand is fortunate not to have a long public history of accidents or 
incidents in this sector , the country and its people are not unique . Based on the 
accidents  and regulatory trends  in this sector overseas , and the CAA's comments in 
their incident report 20/6775 , current reporting to the CAA may not reveal an 
accurate  image of the sector's performance.   
5.13. This accident was not fatal and the crew were fortunate to have survive d an 
unexpected impact in cold water at a remote location at night , but it could easily 
have been fatal.  The investigation has identified safety issues with the lack of 
minimum performance requirements and operating standards  that can still impact 
upon this sector . Regulators  in other jurisdictions have already addressed the increase 
in sector activity and made changes to improve the safe operation of the sector.   
5.14. In response to the draft report, t he CAA advised that it has sc heduled a new rules 
project in 2022 that will include addressing NVIS operations.  CAA stated that : 
We currently have work on the Transport Rules programme that will address 
part of this issue. The current work will help provide clarity about the use of 
NVIS; and is currently programmed for consultation in 2023. Part of the project 
includes an amendment to the rules to accommodate NVIS usage in New 
Zealand and to provide an appropriate level of regulatory oversight. The 
Assorted Issues is next in line for ru les drafting, with consultation envisaged in 
2023.  
Additionally, the NVIS related AC91 -13 is undergoing a substantive rewrite to 
ensure appropriate up -to-date and fit -for-purpose guidance is provided to NVIS 
approved operators. The Authority is aiming to w ork on updates to the Rules 
and AC91 -13 in tandem with drafts of documents going out for consultation 
together.  
5.15. The New Zealand HAA sector is growing fast and has recently seen significant 
reorganisation and consolidation into regional centres of operation  with a customer -
driven performance standard (Ambulance New Zealand, 2018) .  
5.16. The Commission welcomes the safety action to date. However, it believes more action 
needs to be taken to ensure the safety of future operations. Therefore, the 
Commission has made a recommendation in section 6 to address this issue.  
CRM training for helico pters  
5.17. The introduction of NVIS operations for the commercial helicopter sector within New 
Zealand was intended to improve safety. However, t he lack of clear guidance on 
 
64 See the Flight Safety HEMS Industry Risk Profile , particularly  risks 10,  12, 16 and 20 . 
 
  Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 49 >>
 appropriate CRM competencies to support  this activity has meant that some of the 
risks associated with NVG use were not sufficiently managed.  
5.18. The current guidelines in AC91 -13 allow a non -pilot crew member to wear NVGs and 
assist the pilot to ensure clearance from obstacles and other assistance as required.  
However, there is little expectati on about  training of non -pilot crew members , the 
extent of their role , or ongoing training in CRM with the pilots.  
5.19. CAR Part 135 sets out the conditions and requirements for helicopter CTOs applicable 
to air ambulance and NVIS operations, but has no expect ations for CRM with single 
or multi -pilot operations  or NVIS crew members . It is a safety issue that such a 
significant benefit  in accident and incident prevention is not defined, trained  and 
regularly practi sed. 
5.20. No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission has 
made a recommendation in section 6 to address this issue.  
Helicopter loading  
5.21. The issue  of overloaded helicopters is not new to the Commission. While the 
helicopter may remain controllable and able to be flow n, overloading it adds 
unnecessary risk .  
5.22. In all cases  the Commission has  investigated, o perators had processes in place to 
prevent overloading,  but some pilots continued to do so , indicating a normalisation 
of deviance .65 The CARs  and aircraft flight manu als also prohibit the practice of 
internal overloading.  
5.23. While the Commission has not made a recommendation in this report addressing 
these routine violations , operators and pilots must rem ain aware that overloading a 
helicopter is adding risk to the operation and potentially may cause associated issues 
that could  be cumulative  or present later as an unexpected failure .   
Life-raft and survival equipment  
5.24. The helicopter was carrying the required life -raft f or this type of operation . The crew 
were wearing full immersion suits  and life -jackets  and had appropriate emergency 
equipment and location devices stowed  in a grab -bag in the cargo area. After 
escaping from the upturned , semi -submerged  helicopter , the only survival equipment 
readily available to the crew was what  they each had on their person  (an immersion 
suit and a life -jacket ). 
5.25. The immersion suits and life -jackets were significant factor s in the crew's survival,  but 
the rest of the survival equipment was ineffective because it was not able to be 
retrieved  after the accident . 
5.26. The operator has developed a new standard operating procedure for flights into the 
Southern Ocean  and the CAA will be involved in its review and approval.  
5.27. While t he Commission has not made a recommendation to address  this safety issue , 
carrying the required safety equipment on board an aircraft does not necessarily 
make it effective in an emergency . Operators planning extended flights over water

practice or social norm within an orgnaisation  or industry .

   need to consider the emergency equipment required , where it is stowed , and ensure  
that the crew are trained in its use . This is highlighted as a key lesson  in section 7 .

 6 Recommendations   
Ngā tūtohutanga  
 
General   
6.1. The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues  found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents.  
6.2. In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendations are 
implemented as soon as practicable  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents 
occurrin g in the future.    
New recommendations   
6.3. On 7 March 2023,  the Commission recommended that  the Civil Aviation 
Authority  of New Zealand  address the growing gap between New Zealand 's 
minimum performance requirements and technical standards for NVIS and 
helicopter air ambulance operations and current international best practice s. 
(021/22) 
6.4. CRM  competency is not yet an effective safety measure  for helicopters operating 
under CAR Part 135.  On 22 February 2023,  the Commission recommended 
that the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand address  this safety issue . 
(022/22) 
6.5. On 27 March 2023 the Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
You have  asked  if the Authority  can advise  its position  in relation  to the 
implementation of the above recommendations, including the actions 
taken (or to be taken) and the estimated timeframe.  
Existing  work  
The Authority  has two existing  programmes  of work  that relate  to the 
recommendations.  
The first is that as part the Authority's rule development work, (the 
Transport Rules Programme)  AC91 -13 (Night  Vision  Imaging  Systems  - 
Helicopter)  is being  redrafted  to align the AC with new technology and 
ICAO Standards.1 
When  the redraft  is complete,  it will be released  for consultation.  However,  
the timing  of that release is yet to be determined and so I cannot give you a 
specific timeframe, but will update you further, as below.  
The second  is that the Authority  will, through  its monitoring  and 
inspection  function, continue  to both  promote  international  best  practice  
and assess  operators'  ability  to identify and appropriately manage the 
risk of using NVIS against best practice.  
The above  are clear  steps  that will address  the issues  identified,  and form  part of our 
response  to the Commission's  inquiry.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 52 >>
   New  work  
In addition, to ensure that any other gaps that the Authority should resolve 
in this area are  identified  and responded  to, the Authority  will commence  a 
gap analysis  to identify  if any further work is appropriate in the areas of crew 
competency and performance/standards in the helicopter air  ambulance 
space  to support  giving effect to recommendations 021/22 and 022/22.  
You have  asked  that we respond  to you further  on our 
response  to your recommendations and we are happy to 
do so.  
Timeframes  
For an update  on the gap analysis,  and the AC9-31 consultation  timeframe,  
we expect  to give you an update in early September.

 7 Key lessons  
Ngā akoranga matua  
 
7.1. The minimum requirements for NVG currency  do not equate to proficiency. A pilot 
needs to also feel comfortable flying with NVGs and confident about their own 
knowledge and skill  with NVIS operations.   
7.2. The benefit of underwater  escape techniques training and immersion suits to 
helicopter crew flying over water cannot be emphasised enough. They are lifesa ving. 
7.3. If you need to wear an immersion suit  because of the risk  presented by your 
operating environment , also carry a PLB and other selected survival items  on your 
person  to support your survival chances and expedite a  rescue .  
7.4. When operating helicopters using NVGs, radio altimeters become  an essential 
instrument . Their effective use at low level and crew awareness of what actions to 
take with height alerts should be a standard flight crew and NVIS crew member  
recurrency training  exercise.   
7.5. Pilots should log their NVG flight time in a separate column of their logbook.  
7.6. Overloading the internal load  capacity  of a helicopter is a safety hazard that can 
affect  the material integrity of the structure and components and it consequently 
reduces  flight safety margin s. Pilots and operators should be alert to  this risk and 
actively prevent  this practice . 
7.7. Regulators and operators must remain aware that when operating aircraft  over water, 
carryi ng the required emergency equipment on board does not make them  effective 
emergency safety device s. To be effective, emergency equipment (such as a life -raft) 
must  not only  be accessible , but must be locatable in an emergency and deployable  
for the crew to  use.

 9 Conduct of the Inquiry  
He tikanga rapunga  
9.1. On 23 April 2019 , the CAA formally notified the Commission of the occurrence  from  
the evening before.  The Commission subsequently opened an inquiry under section 
13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an 
Investigat or-In-Charge.  
9.2. A protection order was placed to cover the wreckage off Auckland Islands and the 
door found floating and retrieved by a search vessel.  Another protection order was 
issued to the operator to protect evidence related to the aircraft, the pilot and the 
planning records for the operation . 
9.3. The Commission advis ed the Japan Transport Safety B oard of the accident,  and they 
appointed an accredited representative as the State of Manufacture  in accordance 
with ICAO Anne x 13 on 8 May 2019.  
9.4. Two investigators travelled to Te Anau on 24 April 2019 to conduct interviews and 
recover evidence.  The helico pter maintenance manuals were secured and collected 
from Queenstown on the way back. The crew were back in Te Anau and were 
interviewed that week along with other key personnel associated with the operator.  
The investigators left on 26 April 2019.  
9.5. The wreckage was recovered by the operator under a protection order from the 
Commission . Once the wreck was returned to Invercargill, it was examined by two 
TAIC investigators on 13 May 2019 and then arrangements were made to recover the 
wreckage to Wellington . The GPS was recovered and immersed in fresh water and 
then safe handed to Wellington.  
9.6. The GPS was cleaned and dried and the memory chip removed for data extraction  
process . The log file was obtained and validated.   
9.7. The final analysis of this investigatio n was presented to the Commission on 21 
October 2020 .  
9.8. On 5 September 2022,  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to 
seven  individuals and organisations  for their comment  in accordance with the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission A ct 1990 . 
9.9. The Commission received  and considered seven  responses , including four 
submissions . The other three parties had  no comment .  
9.10. On 18 January 2023, the Commission approved further consultation on some 
changed extracts of its draft report. Four responses  were received and considered . 
That includ ed one submission and three responses with no comment on this extract 
document . Changes resulting from the second round of submissions have been 
included in the final report.  
9.11. On 7 March 2023 , the Commission approved the final report for publication .

 Glossary  
Kuputaka  
Advisory 
Circular  CAA advisory circulars (ACs) contain information about standards, 
practices, and procedures that the Director has found to be an 
acceptable means of compliance with the associated rule.  Advisory 
circulars are numbered after the rule part that they refer to.  For example,  
AC91 -13 is associated with CAR Part 91.  
Altimetry  Altimeters are used to display an aircraft's vertical location above the 
earth's surface. A baromet ric altimeter measures distance from sea level 
using air pressure , which  decreases as altitude increases and vice versa. 
As air pressure differs across geographic regions , and as temperature 
changes, the pilot must set the local barometric pressure (correc ted to 
sea level) for the displayed altitude to be accurate. If this does not occur, 
then the barometric altimeter will either over - or under -read as shown 
below (sourced from  internet) . 
 
 
A radio (or radar) altimeter does not rely on air pressure; it measures the 
height of an aircraft above the ground by timing how long it takes a 
beam of radio waves to travel to the ground and reflect up to the 
aircraft's receiver  as shown below (sourced from internet) . 

 
Final Report AO -2019 -005 
<< Page 60 >>
    
CFIT A category of accident where an airworthy aircraft under complete 
control of the pilot is flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle.  
Exposition  A set of documents required from an operator that the CAA need to 
approve to issue that operator with an air operat or certificate .  The 
document set  is signed by the operator's chief executive and must 
describe  a specific set of information in accordance with the CAA Rule  
Part applicable to that air operation . It includes how the operator will 
comply with requirements in the CAA rules, the senior persons 
responsible for compliance and operation, the activities of the operation , 
the aircraft being used and the standard operating procedures.    
Heli winch  A helicopter operation involving the use of a hoist mechanism with cab le 
and hook that allows a lowering and/or pick up of an external 
load/cargo/person from the side of the helicopter.  
NVG/NVIS  Night vision googles (NVGs) are an item of equipment that, together 
with other elements (such as aircraft lighting and approved operating 
procedures ), form a night vision imaging system (NVIS). NVIS operations 
allow a pilot to have enhanced vision while flying at night under visual 
meteorological conditions (VMC). The use of NVGs does not alter the 
requirement for minimum visual flight rules (VFR) conditions to be 
present for the flight to proceed. A pilot is not required to have an 
instrument flight rules (IFR) rating to use NVGs.  
Station  Fuselage station numbers identify locations fore and aft along an 
aircraft's fuselag e with the numbers being measured from a reference 
datum (station zero).

   Appendix 6  Overwater Night HNVGO operations  
This is an extract from the Operator's Exposition V17.21  
Operational Planning and procedures  
1. When HNVGO (helicopter night vision goggles operation) is to be conducted low level 
over water, the potential for impact with water, due to the loss of situational awareness is 
ever present.  
 
• To avoid this continued diligence must be paid to the Sea State, Wind velocity, Hover 
references and Surface definition.  
• Crew must be able to maintain continuous visual contact with known reference points 
in the area such as islands, shorelines or boats.  
• Request or ascertain the availability of sufficient water/surface distu rbance and/or 
surface objects which may provide adequate surface contrast to maintain depth 
perception which may assist the crew in maintaining a safe height.  
2. Escape routes if unanticipated weather is encountered to known reference points.  
 
3. Use of Ra dar Altimeter both during approach to the area as well as during time in area, 
setting decision height alarm accordingly. Maximum Rate of descent not to exceed 300 feet 
per minute.  
 
4. During overwater flight, one of the most critical are as of concern is the texture of the 
water surface. The texture of the water surface will vary from extremely rough during high 
winds to a mirror -like surface when the winds are calm. The rougher of the water, the easier 
it is to judge altitudes above the w ater. A smooth water surface may induce many illusions 
because pilots cannot sense motion or determine the height of the aircraft above the water. 
When the surface of the water is smooth, the aircraft may have to be flown higher. Radar 
altimeter cross chec k also must be completed more frequently. Smooth surfaces may induce 
the sensation of being too high above the water. The pilot may react by placing the aircraft 
into a descent toward the water. Spatial disorientation also may occur over smooth water 
becau se of the reflection of the stars in the water. To prevent vertigo when flying over 
smooth surfaces, pilots must trust the radar altimeter and their other flight instruments.
 
    
  
 
   Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori  scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngāti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai māram a' (i te 
ara haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. 
Mārama (from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and 
Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) by their son Tā ne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling 
within), which brought light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe' or 
'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the 
mother and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of 
knowledge that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. 
The continual wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represents the individual 
inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā h au e whā - the four winds  
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the 
sky, cloud, and wind. The re is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 
'long white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a 'Aviation'.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this 
Kōwha iwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that 
ships sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for Maritime.   
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere ' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and 
everything that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
