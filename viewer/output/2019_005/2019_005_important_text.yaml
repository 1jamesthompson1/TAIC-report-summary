  \ operator regula rly flew helicopter operations in the Southern Ocean down to \n\
  Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands  so had established a procedure with remote\
  \ \naccommodation and fuel replenishment facilities . This flight was similar  in\
  \ that it was \na long-distance  positioning flight over water to a remote base\
  \ where they would \nconduct shorter local flights . At the completion of the local\
  \ flights , they would \nprepare and conduct  the long return flight . The helicopter's\
  \ GPS navigation system \nalready had t he waypoints and local landmarks stored\
  \ in its database for these \nSouthern Ocean flights . \n3.2. The pilot had appropriate\
  \ flight experience with the operator, including meeting the \nminimum recency with\
  \ NVGs and the required company authorisations to conduct \nthis flight . They had\
  \ also flown the route once before  in daylight . \n3.3. The pilot and crew members\
  \ were trained and proficient in underwater escape \ntechniques from a submerged\
  \ helicopter and they were wearing full immersion suits. \nThese safety considerations\
  \ kept the crew  alive and buoyant  in the co ld water.  \n3.4. The following section\
  \ describes what happened and then analyses the circumstances \nsurrounding the\
  \ event to identify those factors that increased the likelihood of the \nevent occurring\
  \ or increased the severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety \nissues\
  \ that have the potential to adversely affect future operations. Safety issues that\
  \ \ninfluenced th is accident were identi fied as:  \n\u2022 Single -pilot VFR operations\
  \ into the Southern Ocean . \n\u2022 Regulatory void for NVIS and air ambulance\
  \ operations . \n\u2022 CRM training in helicopters . \n3.5. Lastly,  two safety\
  \ issue s regarding helicopter loading and survival equipment are  \nexplained.\
  \ These safety issu es were  identified during the investigation as safety \nfactors\
  \ that increased risk, but were  not consider ed to have had a causal effect on\
  \ the \naccident. However, they are regarded as safety issues because of their systemic\
  \ \nnature and risk to other helicopter operations.  \nWhat happened  \n3.6. The\
  \ impact forces and damage to the nose area showed that the helicopter had \nimpacted\
  \ the sea at a shallow angle , but at a speed  that was consistent with the \ncrew's\
  \ accounts . Post-accident inspection of t he helicopter, supported by interviews\
  \ \nof the crew, showed that the helicopter was operating normally with the main\
  \ rotors \nbeing driven by the engines when they were suddenly stopped by impact\
  \ with the \nwater. It was also determined that the helicopter had  sufficient fuel\
  \ remaining to \nsafely land.  \n3.7. The helicopter arrived at Auckland Islands\
  \ after dark at about 1930  and the pilot was \nusing NVGs , as was the paramedic\
  \ who was acting as NVIS crew member for the \nflight . The islands are uninhabited\
  \  so had no artificial lighting  to assist the NVG \nillumination. The only illumination\
  \ was from the celestial night sky,  but that was \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005\
  \ \n<< Page 26 >>\n   limited by local cloud and atmospheric conditions . The moon\
  \ had not risen by this \ntime and the predicted night -time illumination was at\
  \  its lowest level for the night.  \n3.8. Both the pilot and NVIS crew member said\
  \ they saw the hills as they approached \nAuckland Islands and a cloud layer  over\
  \ the landing area  with an opening wedge \nfrom the northwest . The pilot recalled\
  \ seeing the outline of Por t Ross and part of \nEnderby Island.  They also both\
  \ recall ed seeing the cliffs a few seconds before the \naccident. The winch operator\
  \ in the rear cabin did not have NVGs on and recalled \nthat it was too dark to\
  \ see outside.  This shows that the NVGs were functioning and \ncomplementing  the\
  \ front seat crew's night  vision at the time of the accident.  They \nalso recalled\
  \ that after the accident, while swimming  around the helicopter and \nrecovering\
  \ items  from the wreckage , there was s ufficient ambient light for them to \n\
  see the cliffs 100 metres away with unaided vision.  \n3.9. The pilot saw cloud\
  \ that covered the landing point and a very dark area adjacent that \nthey interpreted\
  \ to have been clear of cloud.  The pilot expressed this opinion to the \nNVIS crew\
  \ member  who accepted that explanation. The cloud was below their current \naltitude\
  \ of between 1500 and 2000 feet  and was very likely  to have been sea fog. \nThe\
  \ dark area would very likely  have been an absence of reflected light from the\
  \ \ncalm sea surface to the crew.  \n3.10. The pilot describe d their intention\
  \ to the NVIS crew member to descend in the area \nclear of cloud  and then follow\
  \ the coastline  back towards the landing point. If that \nwas not possible, they\
  \ would head to a higher landing point and camp out the night.  \nThe GPS had several\
  \ suitable landing points  saved in memory from previous trips.  The \npilot said\
  \ that the coastline  is usually more clearly defined through NVGs due to the \n\
  greater light scatter from the rough surface.  \n3.11. The pilot set the radio altimeter\
  \  reference to 1000  feet and started a descent . \nAccording to the GPS log ,\
  \ this descent rate from 2000  feet to 1000  feet was slightly \nover 500 ft/min\
  \  and at approximately 1 25 knots  (see Appen dix 5 ). The NVIS crew \nmember started\
  \  to read out the altimeter heights. The pilot did not expect the crew \nmember\
  \ to do this , ask for it , question the source of the information, or stop it.\
  \  The \nNVIS crew member was reading from the left-hand  barometric altimeter,\
  \ which  was \nstill set at the reference pressure for their departure at Invercargill.\
  \ While the local \nQNH33 for Auckland Islands was available  to the operator ,\
  \ this was not provided to \nthe pilot . Based on the pressure difference, the barometric\
  \ altimeter would have been \ndisplaying  about 50 feet higher than the helicopter\
  \ actually was above the sea \nsurface.   \n3.12. After reaching 1000 feet, the\
  \  pilot had slowed to about 80 knots  and maintained \nabout 900  feet for about\
  \ three minutes  (see GPS flight record in Appendix 5 ). The \nhelicopter was making\
  \  a gentle turn from south through west towards a final track to \nthe north. The\
  \ pilot reset the radio altimeter  to 500 feet and continued to descend . \nAccording\
  \ to th e GPS , the descent rate was above 1200 ft/min,  which is consistent \n\
  with the pilot's account of descending into the clear area . The NVIS crew member\
  \ was \nconcerned about the descent rate and called out to the pilot to check their\
  \ \"speed \". \nThe NVIS crew member was not a pilot, or trained to have any flying\
  \ capability such \nas the reading  and interpretation of instruments , or trained\
  \ in the use of correct \n \n33 The pressure set on the subscale of the altimeter\
  \ so that the instrument indicates its height above sea level.  Q-\nCodes are a\
  \ standard set of three letter codes starting with the letter Q , each with a specific\
  \ meaning.  \n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 27 >>\n aviation terminology.\
  \ The pilot was confused by the call (see paragraph 3.30), but \nhappy with the\
  \ airspeed so carried on.  \n3.13. After reaching 500 feet, the pilot reset the\
  \ radio altimeter  to 250 feet  and continued \nto descend. This height above sea\
  \ level would have been clear of the local terrain. The \npilot recalled seeing\
  \ the radio altimeter alert light illuminate, but said that they did \nnot continue\
  \ to monitor the height .  \n3.14. The NVIS crew member was reading out the barometric\
  \ altitude  as they descended,  \nand it became steady at 200 feet  for several\
  \ calls. The NVIS crew member was also \nlooking out and noticed a cliff face directly\
  \ ahead  that they were closing in on very \nfast. These were the cliffs to the\
  \ south of Croz ier Point . The  cliffs were 20 metres high \nabove the beach (66\
  \ feet) and then the land is almost flat  from there  across the \npeninsular  to\
  \ Port Ross . The NVIS cre w member  immediately alerted  the pilot  who \nalso\
  \ saw the cliffs  and started to flare and bank  right  to avoid hitting them .\
  \ Without \nany further warning , the helicopter impacted the sea.  \nWhy did the\
  \ helicopter impact the sea surface?  \n3.15. The Commission found that several\
  \ factors contributed to this accident. Each of those \nfactor s is described below\
  \ under separate headings.   \nFlight p lanning  \n3.16. This flight was initially\
  \ planned to have been completed in daylight.  \n3.17. The operator's exposition\
  \ included helicopter flights deep into the Southern Ocean \nfrom New Zealand to\
  \ Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands.  They  also operated \nlocal flights in\
  \  the Antarctic. They had established procedures , remote bases  and the \ninfrastructure\
  \ to support these types of operations.  \n3.18. The pilot was experienced in the\
  \ company's operations in New Zealand , the Antarctic, \nand had flown once before\
  \ to Auckland Islands.  The pilot had about 73 hours of \nexperience flying at night\
  \  and met the operator's minimum NVG currency of three \ntake-offs and landings\
  \ within the last 90 days.  They were also current with  their \nknowledge of the\
  \ company's operational procedures, NVIS competency  and the Part \n135 operations\
  \ flight crew competency check.   \n3.19. The NVIS crew member was trained and current\
  \ in NVG operations , HUET and CRM . \nThey had flown two previous medivac flight\
  \ s to Auckland Islands with another pilot . \nThey had also flown  one local NVG\
  \ medivac with this pilot from  a Southland site a \nfew days before.  The NVIS\
  \ crew member had just under 200 hours of experience in \nthat role on NVGs.  \n\
  3.20. The risk profile changed as the day progressed, but the plan remained the\
  \ same . The \nfirst step cha nge to the risk profile was due to the delay  in departure\
  \ while waiting for \nthe medical supplies  to arrive . This delay meant that the\
  \ landing at Enderby Island \nwould be at night  and it required the illumination\
  \ level at the destination to be \nconsidered,34 along with a night descent procedure\
  \ over water on NVGs.   \n3.21. One of the known risks while using NVGs is the potential\
  \ loss of contrast that a flat \ncalm sea creates. It makes height judgement more\
  \ difficult and the sea surface may \n \n34 See later at Single -pilot VFR operations\
  \ into the Southern Ocean . \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 28 >>\n  \
  \ not be visible through NVGs. These types of situations are described in AC91 -1335\
  \ \nand in the operator's exposition36 (See Appendix 6  for the extracted text from\
  \ the \nExposition ). It is possible to gain a significant improvement in safety\
  \ by the NVIS crew \nmember contributing to the pilot's situational awareness in\
  \ a more effective way. This \nis explained later in the section on CRM.   \nPilot\
  \ had minim al NVG recency  \n3.22. The flight was progressing normally as they\
  \ flew south in daylight. The situation \nchanged after night fell and the crew\
  \ were wearing NVGs. The second  step change in \nrisk profile  occurred when the\
  \ crew realised that the landing point was covered in \ncloud.  \n3.23. It was getting\
  \ near to the maximum duty time for the pilot. The exposition allowed \nfor up to\
  \ 8.5 hours flying in any 11-hour period,  but had no weighting for NVG time . \n\
  AC119 -337 provides examples for flight and duty time and suggests a weighting \n\
  multiplier  of 2.3 for every hour flown on NVGs.  The pilot had completed a short\
  \ flight \nin the morning  before this operation. It had been  about four hours\
  \ of flying  since \nthey left Te Anau with about three hours of planning and waiting\
  \ for medical supplies \nbefore tha t. As there was not enough fuel to return to\
  \ the mainland , the crew were \ncommitted to landing somewhere on Auckland Islands.\
  \   \n3.24. Although the pilot met the minimum requirement to remain current with\
  \ NVGs , the \nactual logged flight time on NVGs over the last 90 days was less\
  \ than one hour.  The \nrequired three take -offs and landings  had been part of\
  \ two separate flights  that had \nextended into night , and the take -offs and\
  \ landing s were not needed for the \nopera tions,  but were made after dark to\
  \ remain current wi th night VFR . The pilot's \nlast flight crew competency check\
  \ on NVGs was conducted four  months before the \naccident flight. Low-level flight\
  \ over water was not checked in that flight check.  \n3.25. CAR 61.29 defines what\
  \ information pilots must log in their logbooks . It does not \ndifferentiate between\
  \ VFR or IFR night flight and night flight using NVGs. It just \nrequires a record\
  \ of flight at night  for both VFR and IFR . The pilot did not record their  \n\
  NVG flight  time separately  and some of that total night -time include d an initial\
  \ night \nVFR rating. T he two separate VFR night flight record s could be merged\
  \ for any pilot \nand a pilot's logged night flight is therefore ineffective to\
  \ determine recent fligh t \nexperience in either  night VFR or NVG at night . \
  \ \n3.26. With more currency on NVGs , the pilot may have question ed their impression\
  \ of a \ndark area beyond the cloud . With a different expectation from the CRM,\
  \ the NVIS \ncrew member may have been more effective  in challenging the pilot's\
  \ perception. \nThey had experienced a low layer of fog about an hour earlier in\
  \ the flight during \ndaylight. At th at time the sea surface state and the wind\
  \ direction would have been \nvisible and may have helped to anticipate conditions\
  \ at their destination.  \nUnstable  descent near the surface  \n3.27. The next\
  \ step change in the risk profile occurred when the pilot made a steep descent \n\
  near the surface  on NVGs  and conti nued below their selected reference height\
  \ .   \n \n35 CAA AC91 -13, section 3.2.3 Overwater operations . \n36 SLH Exposition\
  \ V17.21, Overwater Night HNVGO operations.  \n37 AC119 -3 Air operation certification\
  \  - Part 135 operat ions. \n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 29 >>\n 3.28.\
  \ The exposition38 stated that the maximum descent rate on NVGs was 300  ft/min\
  \ and \nfor pilots to use the radio altimeter  both on descent and while in the\
  \ area, setting the \ndecision height alarm accordingly.  The G PS record showed\
  \ that the pilot descended \ninitially at about 500  ft/min down to 1000 feet above\
  \ the surface, then at over 1300  \nft/min until just before impact.  \n3.29. The\
  \ last radio altimeter setting was found to have been 250 feet. A controlled descent\
  \ \nand level off at this height would have allowed the pilot to search for visible\
  \ ground \nreferences through the NVGs or use the pilot-controlled  spotlight to\
  \ assist. The p ilot \nsaid they set the decision height on the radio altimeter,\
  \  but then did not control the \nhelicopter to remain above that set height.  The\
  \ pilot recalled that they were primarily \nlooking outside  while noting the NVIS\
  \ crew member's  calls and judging the \nhelicopter 's height using depth perception\
  \ . When the pilot saw the cliffs, they \nrecalled being surprised that the helicopter\
  \ was lower than expected,  indicating a \ndisparity between their situational awareness\
  \ and the actual position of the \nhelicopter.   \n3.30. The N VIS crew member became\
  \  concerned about the descent rate and attempted to \nchallenge  the pilot. However,\
  \  the terminology used did not convey that message to \nthe pilot. The word \"\
  speed\" directs a pilot to verify  the aircraft's airspeed (forward \nspeed through\
  \ the air) and they would do this by  looking at the airspeed indicator . To \n\
  draw a pilot's attention to the aircraft's rate of descent, the correct terminology\
  \ would \nbe \"descent rate\", which is shown on the vertical speed indic ator.\
  \ The NVIS crew \nmember 's training was limited to observing for obstacles during\
  \ take-off and landing \nand providing direction al clearance information  to the\
  \ pilot . With more appropriate \nCRM training,39 the NVIS crew member 's assistance\
  \ could have been more eff ective  \nas a risk control.  \n3.31. The pilot did not\
  \ have an instrument rating . Not having an IFR rating  meant they  \nwere likely\
  \  more reliant on external visual references for flight attitude than  referring\
  \ \nto instruments.  A descent at night on NVGs with minimal celestial lighting\
  \ required \nmore reliance on the radio altimeter and GPS  and familiarity with\
  \ their use . With the \nreduced FOV through NVGs, i t is also likely  that the\
  \ pilot was fixated on looking \noutside for ground reference to the detriment of\
  \ an instrument scan inside . It is \npossible that the descent would have been\
  \ better controlled if the pilot also had an \ninstrument rating and was proficient\
  \ at switching between visual and instrument \nreference systems.   \n3.32. An extra\
  \ ct below from the Australian CASA Advisory  Circular , Multipart AC  91-13 \n\
  (CASA, 2022)  describes scanning procedures while flying with NVGs . Under high\
  \ \nworkload s, CRM  is an effective safety measure  with scanning . The AC  states\
  \ that for a \nmulti -crew environment, coordination of scan responsibilities is\
  \ vital.  \n \n38 SLH Exposition V1 7.21, Overwater Night HNVGO operations . \n\
  39 See later at CRM training  for helicopter  operations . \n \nFinal Report AO\
  \ -2019 -005 \n<< Page 30 >>\n    \nOther factors  \n3.33. Two other factors also\
  \ contributed to this accident  - single -pilot VFR operations into \nthe Southern\
  \ Ocean and CRM. They  are covered later in more detail .  \nSingle -pilot VFR operations\
  \ into the Southern Ocean  \nSafety issue: The operator's procedures for single\
  \ -pilot VFR operations into the Southern Ocean \nwere not complete or ade quate\
  \ at the time of this accident to safely manage the flight.  \n3.34. This type of\
  \ operation carried a significant amount of risk over more common \nmedivac operations\
  \ within the  NZFIR . The helicopter had a normal duration on \ninternal tanks \
  \ of two hours, but the flight south was beyond that range. Extra fuel had \nto\
  \ be carried in external pods and the helicopter needed to be refuel led just before\
  \ \nleaving the NZFIR. Cargo weight was critical with extra gear needed for the\
  \ helicopter \nwinch extraction, patient care , passage over the sea, overnight\
  \ stay and remote \nrefueling . The weight of the cargo was limited by the extra\
  \ fuel carried and would be \nfurther constrained with the patient weight on return\
  \ (see Helicopter loading ). \n3.35. The crew were aware that they would be landing\
  \ after dark and would be using NVGs \nfor the approach and landing to an unlit\
  \ and uninhabited remote island. They needed \nadditional skills and equipment to\
  \ conduc t this flight and to be current in its use. \nThey also needed to assess\
  \ the weather at the landing point and if they had time to \nreach it while the\
  \ visibility conditions and illumination levels were still suitable for \nnight\
  \ VFR.  \n\n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 31 >>\n 3.36. At some point\
  \ along the way  they would reach a decis ion point from where they \ncould still\
  \ return and land safely. A little later they would reach a point where they \n\
  could not return from40 and they would be committed to continuing and landing at\
  \ \nAuckland Islands. They could see Auckland Islands before th e decision  point\
  \ and were \nable to visually assess if the weather was suitable to proceed. They\
  \ also had access \nthrough their base  support  to weather information from MetService's\
  \ AWS  located \non Enderby Island.   \n3.37. The operator had c onducted flights\
  \ into the Southern Ocean before and the situation \nwas included in the exposition\
  \ under 'Offshore air operations for flights beyond the \nNZFIR '. That procedure\
  \ listed minimum conditions for such flights before they could \nproceed  includi\
  \ ng: ai rcraft type, minimum height, fuel endurance, weather minima, \nemergency\
  \ equipment, crew briefing, flight following and HUET training . \n3.38. Another\
  \ procedure in the exposition  under 'Flights over water ' described the \nrequirements\
  \ for long -range offshore flights. The procedure permitted VFR flights if \nthey\
  \ were less than 100  nm from the shore, but beyond that distance they had to be\
  \ \nIFR. By using Stewart Island, Snares Island and Auckland Islands, the flight\
  \ could \nremain within the 100 nm distance limit all the way  to Campbell Islands.\
  \  \n3.39. The chief pilot and the pilot had discussed the proposed flight before\
  \ the task was \napproved. The pilot was already authorise d by the operator for\
  \ long -range offshore \noperations. They had decided that the crew composition,\
  \ pilot curre ncy, and the risks \nof landing at night at Enderby Island using NVGs\
  \ were adequately managed and that \nthe task should proceed.  \n3.40. Pre-flight\
  \ planning was led by the pilot using the operator's standard flight planning \n\
  mnemonic (GSMEACQ )41 and based on the general content from the exposition . This\
  \ \nplanning procedure was inadequate for an NVG operation and for this long-distance\
  \  \nflight over water for several reasons.  \n\u2022 The illumination level at\
  \ the time of expected arrival was not considered \nand the operator did not have\
  \ a means of obtaining that information.  The \noperator's exposition describes\
  \ the extra planning and risk assessment \nprocedures required for an NVG operation\
  \ under  'Overwater Night \nHNVGO42 Operations ' where it stated , \"illumination\
  \ levels to be \nconsidered\".  The requirement is also in  AC91-13 as described\
  \ in section 2 \nof this report under the heading Risk management for NVIS operations\
  \ .  \n\u2022 The NVGs were reportedly checked and then packed  away until they\
  \ were \ndonned prior to departure from Invercargill. The check did not discover\
  \ \nthe missing battery pack weights. On the flight down, the pilot's NVG \nbattery\
  \ pack was too light and being pushed up by the rolled hood in \ntheir immersion\
  \ suit co llar. The NVIS crew member swapped their heavy \nbattery pack with the\
  \ pilot's light pack to fix that problem. The balance \nweight in the pilot's battery\
  \ pack had been used by another pilot and not \nreplaced.  \n\u2022 The immersion\
  \ suits were reportedly checked at Te A nau before \ndeparture . According to the\
  \ exposition,43 the pilot should have had flares, \n \n40 The point of no return\

  \ \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 32 >>\n   a PLB and a cut -away knife\
  \ in their immersion suit, but had none of these.  \nAnother crew member  had a\
  \ pocketknife and torch in their immersion \nsuit, but none of the crew had a PLB.\
  \ \n\u2022 The helicopter was loaded above the maximum weight limit and a flight\
  \ \nplan load sheet was not submitted  to the operator's base .  \n3.41. The flight\
  \ would leave the NZFIR within 30 minutes after leaving Inver cargill. The \noperator\
  \ had their own flight monitoring system in place to arrange flight following, \n\
  weather information, advice , and to initiate search and rescue if that was required.\
  \  \n3.42. The CAA had placed a restriction on the operator's AOC that did not per\
  \ mit CTOs \noutside the NZFIR  at the time of this flight . The operator was unaware\
  \ of this \nlimitation and had not been consulted . The CAA had approved the operator\
  \ for the \nlast 20 years to operate beyond the NZFIR. It was later discovered to\
  \ have been a n \nadmi nistrative error by the CAA when the limitation was introduced\
  \ in a n updated  \nAOC dated 28 September 2018. The CAA corrected the error  on\
  \ 25 February 2020  \nwith a revised AOC . Consequently, no action was taken against\
  \ the operator for \nconducting this flight beyond the NZFIR  and outside their\
  \ current AOC . \n3.43. While t he operator had substantial procedure manuals for\
  \ major operations, such as \nflying in the Antarctic or when working with the local\
  \ search and rescue organisation , \nthe guidance procedures for this high -risk\
  \ type of operation was spread across \nseveral sections of the exposition. Much\
  \ of the operator's experience had yet to be \ndocumented .  \n3.44. The operator\
  \  had started a document called the 'Southern Ocean Safety Plan ' to \ndescribe\
  \ all aspects of planning and conducting VFR flights into the Southern Ocean. \n\
  It would eventually provide a comprehensive guide and set the standard required\
  \ for \npilots to conduct such flights, but it was in draft form at the time of\
  \ this accide nt and \nhad not been made available to all pilots. The operator later\
  \ provided a copy of  their \nSouthern Ocean Safety Plan dated 1 December 2019 .\
  \ \nDefinition of crew member  \n3.45. The definition of a crew member in the CARs\
  \  is not without  ambiguity .44 The CAA \nissued  a Legal Information Bulletin\
  \  No.4 (LIB 4)  to clarify to operators the CAA's \ninterpretation of the term\
  \  'crew member' for Part 135 operations. However, LIB 4  \nmeans that a lthough\
  \ an operator may consider and assign a person to be a 'crew \nmember' , including\
  \ training them appropriately for the role, the CAA might classify \nthem differently\
  \ as a passenger, or a  'passenger performing a task'. This scenario  can \narise\
  \ with  paramedic s and wi nch operator s.  \n3.46. Furthermore, t he term 'NVIS\
  \ crew member' is defined in the AC 91-13, but not the \nCARs, creating ambiguity\
  \ as to whether such a person is a crew member or \npassenger. Questions can also\
  \ arise as to  whether a n NVIS crew member's role could \nchange from being a crew\
  \ member to a passenger based on their actions  durin g \nflight . For example,\
  \  during the flight to Auckland Islands, whether the paramedic was \na passenger\
  \ until they donned the NVGs.   \n3.47. The Commission considers that the differences\
  \ in status of persons on board aircraft \ncontinue s to be a source of confusion\
  \  for pilots and operators . \n \n44 The Commission had consider ed the crew status\
  \ in investigation AO -2018 -005 ( MD600N forced landing at \nNgamatea Station)\
  \ .   \n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 33 >>\n Present r egulatory void\
  \ for NVIS and air ambulance operations  \nSafety issue: There are no formal risk\
  \ controls in New Zealand for helicopter NVIS  or air \nambulance operations unlike\
  \ other jurisdictions that have set minimum standards in response \nto the high\
  \ accident rate in this sector .  \n3.48. As described earlier  (See ' Aviation\
  \ rules '), there is no formal regulation or \nperformance  standard for NVIS or\
  \ for HAA operations in New Zealand.  Presently, the \nCAA can impress a discretionary\
  \ level of control  through  the CAA's approval process \nfor an operator when they\
  \ apply  to add these types of operations to their AOC.  This \noperator had voluntarily\
  \ adopted much of the content from the AC 91-13 into their \noperating procedures.\
  \  \n3.49. The most recent issue of the AC was in 2011 . Activity in the HAA and\
  \ NVIS  aviation \nsectors in New Zealand has increased  significantly since that\
  \ time  as it has overseas.  \nTrends with overseas regulators have been to increase\
  \ the requirements for crew \ntraining, CRM, operational recency , aircraft equipment\
  \ , and to require pilots to be \ninstrument rated.  \n3.50. In New Zealand , the\
  \ lack of formal  regulation or performance standards  for HAA  \noperations  remains\
  \ , but has been somewhat compensated for  by the activities of \nconsumer  and\
  \ interested sector bodies . Ambulance New Zealand and the NZ \nHelicopter Association\
  \ (a division of Aviation N ew Zealand)  developed a joint \nstandard called the\
  \ 'New Zealand Aeromedical and Air Rescue Standard'  (NZAARS) .45 \nThis came into\
  \ use during the early 2000s with its first three -year review being \ncompleted\
  \ in December 2012.  All contracted helicopter operators provid ing \nhelicopter\
  \ services to Health New Zealand must comply with this standard and be \nindependently\
  \ audited against it .46 \n3.51. The goal of the NZAARS is to ensure the quality\
  \ of service provided by aeromedical \nservices  and air rescue se rvices in New\
  \ Zealand and that it promotes safety , \nconsistency and is patient - or recipient\
  \ -focused. From an aviation perspective, the \nstandard  defines the minimum crew\
  \ experience for each group47 of aircraft operation, \nthe aircraft  type suitable\
  \ for those  operations, minimum equipment  and crew training \nrequirements.  It\
  \ also sets out criteria for human factors and CRM  that must be part of \nthe operator's\
  \  wider safety management system  (SMS) .  \n3.52. For the NVIS requirements ,\
  \ the NZAARS  defers to the CAA AC91 -13, but also adds \ncriteria aimed at recency\
  \ and refresher training that is greater than required in the AC . \nRadar (radio)\
  \ altimeters are required for some group operations as minimum \nequipment , but\
  \ there are no other expectations.  This standard is , in effect, like the \nBasic\
  \ Aviation Risk Standard s (BARS ) requirements described later under Flight Safety\
  \ \nFoundation  and fits within the category of a mandated change driven by customers\
  \ in \nthe 'HEMS Industry Risk Profile '.48 \n \n45 See the full citation  to access\
  \ a copy of this standard (Ambulance New Zealand, 2018) . \n46 As this flight was\
  \ a privately -funded medical evacuation, the NZAARS did not apply . \n47 Helicopter\
  \ aircraft groups defined in the standard are: Group 1 - IFR multi -engine  turbine\
  \ for aeromedical and \nSAR; Group 2 - VFR multi -engine  turbine for same as operations\
  \ as Group 1 ; Group 3 - VFR s ingle engine \nturbine for SAR ; Group 4 - VFR single\

  \ >>\n   United States of America  \n3.53. In 2006, the NTSB published a special\
  \ investigation report on emergency medical \nservices operations  (NTSB, 2006)\
  \ . This was after investigating 55 accidents in the HAA \nsector. NVIS was new\
  \ to civil aviation at the time,  but the report concluded that \nproper use of\
  \ NVGs could help pilots avoid hazards at night.  \n3.54. New Zealand's CARs are\
  \ structured like those of the FAA, with FAA Part 13549 used for \nCTOs.  The FAA\
  \ uses OpsSpecs  for specific activities in CTOs  so an operator may have \nPart\
  \ 135 certification then add other activities to their operating certificate . HAA\
  \ \noperations were  covered under OpsSpec A021 and NVIS under OPsSpec A050. In\
  \ \n2014, the FAA revised several rules and  the HAA requirements were shifted to\
  \ Part \n135, Subpart L. The FAA said about the new rules release that it addressed\
  \ many of \nthe concerns the NTSB had with HAA operations.  \n3.55. Two aviation\
  \ phrases were formalised with the new rules and in FAA documentation. \nThe changes\
  \ were  to: \n\u2022 Replace helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) with the\
  \ term HAA. \n\u2022 Discourage the use of the term \"mission\" because of it s\
  \ implication of \nacceptable losses in military aviation.  \n3.56. In 2017, the\
  \ FAA instructed that all HAA Pilots -in-Command  (PICs) must have a \ncurrent instrument\
  \ rating.  \n3.57. In 2022, the FAA updated OpsSpec A050 for NVIS operations. One\
  \ of the changes \nwas a significant increase in the NVG recency  requirement for\
  \ pilots  before they \ncould fulfill the role of PIC. The requiremen t for three\
  \ take -offs and landings in the \nlast 90 days  was increased  and the period reduced\
  \ . The take -offs and landings were \nextended to a full departure , cruise and\
  \ approach  to land. Area departure and arrivals \nwere included and transitions\
  \ to and from aided flight (using NVGs ). They also \nneeded to have completed six\
  \ NVG operations  in the period to remain current . \nAustralia  \n3.58. The Civil\
  \ Aviation Safety A uthority ( CASA ) had issued a simila r advisory document in\
  \ \n2007 as the New Zealand CAA AC91 -13 with the CASA Civil Aviation  Advisory\
  \ \nPublication CAAP 174 -01. However, in Australia it  was enforced with Civil\
  \ Aviation \nOrder CAO 82.6.  The process for operators was to use the CAAP 174\
  \ -01 as a guide to \nmake the necessary changes to their operation procedures \
  \ to meet the requirements \nof the CAO and  then to apply to CASA for approval\
  \ to use NVGs.  \n3.59. In 2021, the rules in Australia were change d and now all\
  \ the requirements for the use \nof NVGs are included within the new rules structure\
  \  CASA Part s 61, 133 and 138.  A \nnew multi -part manual of standards is out\
  \ for consultation and the multi -part \nAdvisory Circular AC 91-13, AC133 -09,\
  \ AC138 -06 was issued in 2022  (CASA, 2022) . The \nCAO 8 2.6 and CAAP  174-01\
  \ were  repealed . \n3.60. Pilots are required to have a night VFR rating and then\
  \ may gain a n NVIS rating for \ntheir licence  in accordance with Part 61 , Subpart\

  \ Kingdom  \n3.61. The European Union (EU) Commission Regulation 216/2008 was issued\
  \ in 2008 to \nprovide the common rules  for air operations in each member country.\
  \ This was \nrevised in 2012 with Regulation 965/2012  (European Union, 2012)  that\
  \ contained \nSpecific Approvals  (SPA). The SPAs related to additions to a basic\
  \ AOC.  \n3.62. Subpart J of the 2012 r egulation was the SPA for helicopter emergency\
  \ medical \nservices  called SPA.HEMS.100 . Subpart H was the SPA for helicopter\
  \ NVIS operations \ncalled SPA.NVIS.100.  \n3.63. A helicopter intended for use\
  \ at night with NVGs must have a specific airworthiness \napproval for NVIS in accordance\
  \ with Regulation 1702/2003 . \n3.64. In 2014, the UK CAA issued a Safety Directive\
  \ (UK CAA, 2014)  that added specific \nrequirements to both the EU Commission Regulations\
  \ for emergency medical services \nand NVIS operations  conducted within UK . This\
  \ Safety Directive increased the \nminimum requirements for pilots, to only allow\
  \ single -pilot HEMS to proceed if the \npilot held a valid  instrument rating.\
  \  \nFlight Safety Foundation  \n3.65. The Fl ight Safety Foundation50 publishes\
  \ a set of BARS that they provide for guidance \nto aviation sector operators. \
  \ In a standard intended for organisations  that contract \naviation services from\
  \ air operators is a set of minimum standards for NVIS \noperations  called 'Contracted\
  \ Aircraft Operations '. \n3.66. Appendix  5 of that BA RS covers NVG operations.\
  \ It describes the known risks in a \nBowtie risk model format , with each of the\
  \ threats and appropriate controls  given . \nThe listed threats are: NVG failure,\
  \ Flight considerations (pre -planning), Helicopter \ncompatibility, Flight crew\
  \ experience, Flight crew recency and General NVG \nconsiderations.  \n3.67. The\
  \ BARS  has a higher requirement than New Zealand AC91 -13 for: the radio \naltimeter\
  \ , the minimum crew experience and CRM , and the flight crew recency  of \nexperience\
  \ . \n3.68. In 2009 , the Flight Safety Foundation published an industry risk profile\
  \  for helicopter \nemergency medical services (Flight Safety Foundation, 2009)\
  \ . The profile focuses on \nthe voluntary change that the industry sector can control\
  \  to manage risk , but \nrecogni ses that input from  other participants  in the\
  \ system may also be required  to \nminimise  that risk. Those other participants\
  \ are government legislators , regulator y \nbodies  and customer s. The profile\
  \ lists 26 high-level risks that have been determined \nfrom HAA industry data and\
  \ analysis and outlines the appropriate risk treatment \nstrategies  to reduc e\
  \ the risk level.  \nRadio altimeter requirements  \n3.69. The New Zealand requirement\
  \ for radio altimeters is in AC91 -13. The AC requires that \na radio altimeter\
  \  is fitted, but the specifications are very general and say that : \nIt is recommended\
  \ that the radar altimeter be equipped with an audio and/or \nvisual warning device\
  \ that can be triggered at a pilot selectable height.  \n \n50 The Flight Safety\
  \ Foundation is an independent, non -profit international organi sation for research,\
  \ education, \nadvocacy and communications in the field of aviation safety  (Flight\
  \ Safety Foundation, 2016) . \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 36 >>\n \
  \  3.70. The BARS 'Implementation Guidelines ' have a section on helicopter offshore\
  \ \noperation . It relates mostly to oil rig support helicopter operations with\
  \ two -pilot \ncrew who are  both instrument rated,  but it does indicate the ideal\
  \ situation  about \npreventing controlled flight into terrain (or water) (CFIT)\
  \  through the appropriate use \nof radio altimeters . The standard states at section\
  \ 21.6 : \nThe aircraft operator must document in the Operations Manual or MEL51\
  \ a \nrequirement for at least one radio altimeter with dual displays, both  of\
  \ which \nmust be serviceable at the time of dispatch for any offshore  flight at\
  \ night or \nflight conducted under IFR.52 Aircraft operator procedures  should\
  \ address the \nrequirement for setting any aural alerting systems on  the radar\
  \ altimeter and \nthe procedures to be followe d in the event of an  unexpected\
  \ alert  (Flight Safety \nFoundation, 2014) . \n3.71. A later BARS document in 2021\
  \ for offshore helicopter operations safety performance \nrequirements  describes\
  \  one of the accident prevention  goals for prevent ing CFIT \naccidents as a radio\
  \ altimeter  with dual displays . The difference from the ir 2014 \nstandard is\
  \ that each display should provide  an analogue indication  with a visual alert\
  \ \nand automated voice alerting device capability.  It emphasises  that the operator\
  \ must \nhave procedures for any user adjustable voice alert features and for actions\
  \ to be \ntaken by the flight crew in the event of an alert (Flight Safety Foundation,\
  \ 2021) . \n3.72. By having a radio altimeter fitted w ith a visual alert capability,\
  \ the helicopter complied \nwith the recommendation contained within AC91 -13. However,\
  \ the fact that the AC \nonly required either  an aural alert or a visual alert\
  \ makes it differ from  some overseas \njurisdictions which require both  forms\
  \ of alert, including that the visual indication \n(light) is displayed at both\
  \ crew stations, not just for the PIC.53 Some also require \nseparate  altitude\
  \ displays at those crew stations . \n3.73. From an information -processing perspective,\
  \ visual cues rely on the visual processing \nchannel , and to work they must, in\
  \ the first instance, be seen. Because FOV is \nsignificantly restricted when using\
  \ NVGs, cues that may be readily seen with normal \nperiphe ral vision require the\
  \ pilot to be looking at, or very near to, a particular \ninstrument to receive\
  \ that information. The auditory processing channel, however, \ndoes not have this\
  \ limitation since sound is omnidirectional and therefore the \nauditory sense can\
  \  receive input from any direction.  \n3.74. Despite physiological and ergonomic\
  \ limitations, the pilot's FOR will, at any time, be \ndependent on their scan technique.\
  \ This in turn, will be determined by the phase of \nflight and associated workload\
  \ of the pilot at the  time. During busy periods, where \nattention is required\
  \ to be distributed across multiple (and potentially complex) tasks, \npilot scan\
  \ rates can slow or even become fixated on a particular instrument to the \ndetriment\
  \ of other flight parameters.  \n3.75. The increase d demands NVGs place on a pilot's\
  \ visual system can be assisted by the \nutilisation  of other sensory modes  (Wickens,\
  \ 2022) .54 In the final stages of the \n \n51 MEL is Minimum Equipment List for\
  \ an aircraft to remain operational.  \n52 IFR is instrument flight rules . \n53\

  \ coding a target across modalities (such as coupling an aural alert with a visual\
  \ warning) improv es \nthe accuracy of information processing. Auditory stimuli\
  \ are particularly effective in alerting attention as they \nnot only target the\
  \ auditory processing channel, but they also cue an individual's visual attention.\
  \ Further, the \nshort -term auditory store  (echoic memory) is longer than that\
  \ for vision meaning individuals can not only \nregister the alert , but return\
  \ to examine/process it after approximately three to six  seconds.  \n \n  Final\
  \ Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 37 >>\n approach toward Enderby  Island , the pilot\
  \ was mostly focused on the outside \nenvironment to navigate visually around the\
  \ cloud cover and maintain their bearing \nregarding  a suitable landing spot. During\
  \ the post -accident interview, the pilot \nmentioned that it had been helpful having\
  \ the crew member call out  the altitude  \nreadings,55 as their attention was primarily\
  \ outside of the cockpit at that time.  \n3.76. Whether this accident  would have\
  \ been prevented had the radio altimeter been fitted \nwith an aural alert is unknown.\
  \ It is possible that the pilot may have been more \nconscious of the he licopter's\
  \ position above the sea surface as the aural alert \ngenerally encourages more\
  \  active engagement with the instrument itself as opposed \nto passive monitoring\
  \ .56 Potentially, it could also have made the fact that the NVIS \ncrew member\
  \ was calling inco rrect altitudes more readily apparent as there would \nhave been\
  \ a discrepancy between their call -outs and the aural alert sounding.  \n3.77.\
  \ While it cannot be determined to what degree the lack of an aural alerting function\
  \ \ncontributed to this accident, not requir ing what is a well -recognised  safety\
  \ measure \nfor NVIS operations puts the CAA's risk controls out of step with other\
  \ oversea s \nregulators and NVG operational best practice.  \nSummary  \n3.78.\
  \ The introduction of NVIS operations for the commercial helicopter sector wi thin\
  \ New \nZealand was intended to improve safety. The lack of a robust regulatory\
  \ framework to \nsupport this activity, however, meant that some of the risks associated\
  \ with NVG use \nwere not sufficiently managed. Technical standards and practices\
  \ used in New \nZealand for NVIS operations are still based on those common in the\
  \ early 2000s when \nNVGs were first used in civil aviation. Externally from the\
  \ regulator , the HAA sector \nhas introduced a higher standard for NVIS operators\
  \  through contracted HAA \nservices with the NZAARS  standard,  but it only applies\
  \ to selected operators . \n3.79. While the major regulators  in the international\
  \ community have recognised the \nbenefit of NVIS helicopter operations for rescue\
  \ and air ambulance operations , they \nhave also addressed the significant risks\
  \ by providing appropriate guidance and \nperformance expectations. The CAA is still\
  \ reliant on a non -transparent57 and possibly \nunique individual arrangement they\
  \ have with each operator through their air \nopera tor certification process. \
  \ The international community has advanced \nconsiderably and the CAA's guidance\
  \ on NVIS helicopter operations is no longer fit \nfor purpose.  \n \n55 At the\
  \ time , the pilot did not know whether the readings were from the barome tric altimeter\
  \ or the radio \naltimeter .  \n56 The aural alert can be cancelled whil e the light\
  \ would remain on until being reset for a different height.  \n57 Two separate operators\
  \ could have very different conditions  they must meet for CAA through their respect\
  \ ive \nAOC approval process es.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 38 >>\n\
  \   CRM training  for helicopter  operations  \nSafety issue:  The lack of comprehensive\
  \ C RM training qualifications for non -pilots acting  as \ncrew members, combined\
  \ with a lack of guidelines on crew members assist ing a pilot during \nNVIS operations,\
  \ creates an ongoing  risk that helicopter NVIS crews will not have effective CRM.\
  \  \nCAA rules requirements for CRM  \n3.80. CRM is typically defined as the effective\
  \ use of all the resources available to crew \nmembers, including each other, to\
  \ achieve a safe and efficient flight. While CRM falls \nwithin the broader field\
  \ of human fact ors, it is considered a specialised  subject \nregarding  training\
  \ and assessing competency standards as acknowledged in AC121 -4 \nThe Training\
  \ and Assessment of Human Factors and Crew Resource Management58 \n(CAA, 2013) .\
  \ \n3.81. Given most two -pilot operations occur within an airline environment,\
  \ CRM training is \ngraduated across the different licensing levels. Within the\
  \ Private Pilot Licence (PPL) \nHuman Factors theory syllabus, a student is simply\
  \ required to explain how outside \nresources can contribute to the management of\
  \ a flight. The CPL Human Factors \ntheory syllabus builds on this, covering 25\
  \ items under the heading s of Social \nPsychology and Flight Deck Management. The\
  \ theory for ATPL  Human Factors is \nbroadly similar to that for the CPL l icensing\
  \ requirements.  \n3.82. Within New Zealand, air operators conducting operations\
  \ under CAR Part 121 Air \nOperations - Large Aeroplanes  (CAA -1, 2020)  and CAR\
  \ Part 125 Air Operations - \nMedium Aeroplanes  (CAA -2, 2020)  are required to\
  \ have programmes in place for CRM \ntraining and a means by which to assess CRM\
  \ competency on an ongoing basis as \npart of recurrency/proficiency checks.59 There\
  \ are no such requirements for \noperations  under CAR Part 135 Air Operations -\
  \ Helicopters and Small Aeroplanes  \n(CAA, 2019) . \nThe benefit from CRM in small\
  \ size aircraft  \n3.83. The reason NVIS helicopter operations allow for the utilisation\
  \  of a non -pilot crew \nmember is to pr ovide additional safety. For this to be\
  \ achieved, however, both pilot \nand crew member must be highly proficient in all\
  \ aspects of CRM . The NVIS crew \nmember on the accident flight used an incorrect\
  \ term for \"rate of descent\"  by calling \n\"speed \". A central ten et of CRM\
  \ is the ability to draw the pilot's attention to flight \npath deviations. If a\
  \ crew member uses the incorrect terminology, the pilot might  \nfocus their attention\
  \ on the incorrect parameter, potentially to the detriment of a \nmore critical\
  \ one - in this case the vertical speed of the helicopter.   \n3.84. Effective CRM\
  \ results in all crew members sharing a common mental model of their \nsituation\
  \ , which  is essential for the pilot to be able to make the best decision(s) with\
  \ \nthe information provided. T o assist in forming a shared mental model of the\
  \ \nenvironment, it is imperative all crew members understand from which source\
  \ flight \ndata is being provided. When the NVIS crew member was calling out altitudes\
  \ during \nthe final stages of descent, the pilot as sumed that it was  from the\
  \ radio altimeter . The \nNVIS crew member would need to have leaned over to read\
  \ the radio altimeter \n \n58 Part 121 is applicable to Air Operations Large Aeroplanes\
  \ (seating configuration of more than 30 seats or \npayload capacity of more than\
  \ 3410  kilograms ). \n59 Competency assessment for 'soft' or non -technical skills\
  \ such as CRM is significantly complex. Best p ractice, \nsuch as that encouraged\
  \ by AC121 -4, requires assessment of individual behavio ural markers by qualified\
  \ \nexaminers trained in specific, well -developed methodologies , including inter\
  \ -rater reliability.  \n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 39 >>\n accurately.\
  \ If the information provided was incongruent with the pilot's own mental \nmodel,\
  \ it would be  potentially more dangerous th an receiving no information at all\
  \ \nfrom that crew member.  \n3.85. The ability for flight crew to communicate effectively\
  \ is critical to flight safety . \nNumerous accidents due to poor communication\
  \ and misunderstandings on the \nflight deck is the fundamental reason the concept\
  \ of CRM was developed within the \nairline industry. While CRM programmes - and\
  \ the associated check -and-training \ncomponents associated with them - are considerably\
  \ advanced, the requirements to \nimplement these within New Zealand are dependent\
  \ on the particular Part 119 \ncertificate an operator holds. In the case of a helicopter\
  \ CTO, there was no CAA rule \nrequiring  comprehensive CRM trainin g as required\
  \ by other multi -crew operations \nunder Parts 121 and 125.  \nWhat is the role\
  \ of a non -pilot crew member during NVIS operations?  \n3.86. When interviewed\
  \ about their duties following the accident, the NVIS crew member \nstated that\
  \ in addition to their obstacle clearance responsibilities, they liked to call \n\
  out altitude information to pilots, but if a particular pilot didn't necessarily\
  \ want that \ninformation, then they did not have to listen. The chief pilot said\
  \ they were  not clear \non exactly w hat CRM training a non -pilot crew member\
  \ would have received, but that \nthose who were more familiar with cockpit instrumentation\
  \ could prove quite helpful \nto the pilot during flight.  \n3.87. According to\
  \ AC91 -13, the purpose of a n NVIS  crew member is to perform \"e ssential \ninflight\
  \ duties to ensure safe operation of the aircraft during NVG operations\" and \n\
  that they should \"use CRM principles to maintain crew situational awareness\".\
  \ The AC \ndoes not define what constitutes an essential inflight duty and therefore\
  \ it i s unclear \nwhich CRM principles might be applied on board. Potentially,\
  \ this could include \nreading cockpit instrumentation and providing that information\
  \ to the pilot for \nsituational awareness purposes.   \n3.88. While the AC is silent\
  \ on this role definition, Appendix 1 of the AC  points to an \noperator's exposition\
  \  to list the responsibilities and authorities of a n NVIS crew \nmember. In doing\
  \ so, this allows individual operators to define how, and to what \nextent , a non\
  \ -pilot can interact with the pilo t and participate during safety critical \n\
  phases of flight. In this case the operator 's exposition  allowed a crew member\
  \ to \n\"offer timely suggestions and opinions\",  \"critique faulty decisions \"\
  \ and \" advocate for a \ndifferent position, if necessary, to ensure the safety\
  \ of the flight \". Whether this could \ninclude interpretation of flight data from\
  \ the instrument  panel and verbalisation  of \nthose interpretations to the pilot\
  \ appears ambiguous . However,  evidence would \nsuggest that there was certainly\
  \ variation a mongst different NVIS crew members and \npilots within the organisation\
  \ and that expectations were not clearly defined either in \nthe exposition  or\
  \ during pre -flight briefings.  \n3.89. Crew members were required to communicate\
  \ \" effectively''  using \" standard\"  or \n\"gene rally accepted \" aviation\
  \ terminology, yet the exposition contained only examples \nof such terminology\
  \ specific to defined manoeuvres. If this was intended to mean \nthat non -pilot\
  \ crew members were not to offer advice outside of this particular list, \nthis\
  \ was  not clearly specified. Despite this, had the pilot felt that the crew member's\
  \ \ncalled heights  were causing an unnecessary distraction or risk, the correct\
  \ course of \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 40 >>\n   action would have\
  \ been to request that the NVIS crew member to stop. That did not \noccur.  \nWho\
  \ can teach and assess CRM for NVIS operations?  \n3.90. The CAA  provides no guidance\
  \ on how to teach CRM principles  for use with NVIS \ncrew, or how practical competency\
  \ ought to be assessed and graded. For licensing, \nan NVIS flight instructor is\
  \ o nly required to hold a CPL , and as such may have covered \nonly the rudimentary\
  \ elements of CRM as part of their CPL human factors theory \ncourse. To then be\
  \ in a position to not only teach, but also assess , CRM competency \nand standards\
  \ in a multi -crew enviro nment (including for personnel who are not \npilots themselves)\
  \ poses a significant risk to flight safety.  \nNVIS requirements for jurisdictions\
  \ outside of New Zealand  \n3.91. New Zealand Civil Aviation requirements to become\
  \ a n NVIS crew member are \nconsiderably less rigorous that those required by some\
  \ other jurisdictions, such as the \nEuropean Union Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA\
  \ ) and CASA (see Table 1 below ). AC91 -\n13 permits any personnel who are a necessary\
  \ part of a commercial helicopter \noperation (eg, winch crew, paramedics) to qualify\
  \ as a n NVIS crew member if they are \nusing NVGs to su pport a single -pilot operation.\
  \ Aside from the NVIS endorsement \nitself, there are no additional requirements\
  \ to be able to act in this capacity apart \nfrom what an operator may themselves\
  \ choose to put in their exposition. Essentially, \nthis means that a non -pilot\
  \ is permitted to occupy a control seat of a helicopter and \ngive flight guidance\
  \ commands to the PIC without the additional training.  \n3.92. Table 1 compares\
  \ the reg ulatory pre -requisites for NVIS flight crew member training \nin three\

  \ as \nspecified in AMC1 ORO.FC.115,  \nORO.FC.115  and ORO.FC215.  \nEssentially\
  \ this entails CRM \ntraining by a qualified CRM \ntrainer to the standard \nrequired\
  \ for multi -crew airline \noperations, including \nappropriate checking and \n\
  assessment. Should a technical \ncrew member not have \npreviously received theoretical\
  \ \ntraining in human factors to \nthe ATPL level, this must also \nbe completed\
  \ as p er Annex I to \nRegulation (EU) No 1178/2011  \n \n3.93. As well as requiring\
  \ more extensive qualifications, the duties that non -pilot crew \nmembers can partake\
  \ in during NVIS operations are well defined in CASA and EASA \nlegislation. In\
  \ addition to obstacle clearance d uties, Australia, for example, allows an \naircrew\
  \ member to assist with navigation, radio communication, tuning navigational \n\
  aids, helping  with checklist use, and assisting the pilot monitor their systems\
  \ and \ninstrumentation. To do the latter, dedicated training is required to:  \n\
  \ \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 42 >>\n   \u2026adequately recognize, identify,\
  \ announce, and provide verbal correction (the \ncon) to the pilot for drift, rates\
  \ of climb or descent, obstacle avoidance, and \nground hazards for example dust\
  \ and debris  (CASA, 2022) . \n3.94. EASA regulations60 also list the specific duties\
  \ a HEMS technical crew member can \nfulfil. Like CASA, in addition to the primary\
  \ task of collision and obstacle avoidance, \nEASA certified crew members can also\
  \ partak e in the following duties: navigation, \nradio communication and radio\
  \ navigation aid selection, reading of checklists and \nmonitoring of flight parameters.\
  \ To assist the pilot with flight monitoring, EASA \nregulations61 require a crew\
  \ member to be trained in instrument flight techniques, \nspecifically: instrument\
  \ scanning, role of instrumentation in NVIS flight, and unusual \nattitude recovery\
  \ procedures. In addition, one hour of blind cockpit drills must be \nperformed.\
  \  \nSummary  \n3.95. Having a non -pilot crew member wearing NVG and assisting\
  \ the pilot was intended \nto be an additional safety feature that reduced the risk\
  \ associated with single -pilot \nNVIS operations. For this to be effective, thorough\
  \ training and a clear expectation \naroun d the extent of a non -pilot NVIS crew\
  \ member's duties is required,  but this \nguidance  does not exist  in New Zealand\
  \ .  \n3.96. At the time of this accident, there were no prerequisites to become\
  \ a n NVIS  crew \nmember, the definition of what that role entailed was ambi guous,\
  \ and the rules did \nnot require CRM training to an y defined level of competence\
  \ .  \n3.97. In this case, the accident crew were generally able to work together\
  \ using the broad \nprinciples of CRM . However , they did not have the depth of\
  \ training , or share a \ncommon  understanding and use of aviation phraseology\
  \ , to support  the CRM \ntechniques required to manage high -risk situations more\
  \ effectively . \nHelicopter loading  \nSafety Issue : The helicopter was loaded\
  \ above its maximum certified weight limit for the rescue \nflight  and would have\
  \ further exceeded it on the return flight.  \n3.98. This accident is another example\
  \ of where a helicopter was overloaded, but where \nthat action was considered unlikely\
  \ to have influenced the accident.  The Commission \nhas found  in previous accident\
  \ investigations62 that helicopter s were  loaded above \nthe maximum certified\
  \ weight limits  for the accident flight. The Commission has also \nfound that although\
  \ an operator's procedures may clearly describe what is required , \nand an operato\
  \ r has provide d the tools to ensure that a helicopter's maximum all up \nweight\
  \ is not exceeded , pilots routinely violate their procedures .  \n3.99. The operator\
  \ had procedures and quick loading guides to reduce the workload for \npilots. The\
  \ guide in Appendix 1  was the applicable quick guide for this flight. It was \n\
  arranged with the percentage of maximum fuel loads and the associated maximum \n\
  cargo loads. The base weight included an allowance for the role equipment. \n \n\

  \ . \n62 For example,  two recent accidents reported in  TAIC reports  are: AO-2014\
  \ -005, Collision with terrain, Mt Alta , \nand AO -2015 -007, Collision with terrain,\
  \ Fox Glacier , (TAIC, 2014)  and (TAIC, 2015) , respectively . \n \n  Final Report\
  \ AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 43 >>\n Ultimately, the pilot held responsibility to ensur\
  \ e that the helicopter was not loaded \nabove the maximum limits specified  in\
  \ the type certificate.  \n3.100.  Misuse of standard loading guides , or omissions\
  \ of certain items  or underestimated \nweights  in a loading calculation, may result\
  \ in an apparent ly acceptable load . It could \nmean the difference between a departure\
  \ now or a delay  to weigh  items  or leave \nsome items behind . If the load is\
  \ above limits slightly, f uel burn will eventually bring it \nback into normal\
  \ loading limits. The final test for pilots is often made with a dynamic \ncheck.\
  \ This is where the pilot slowly lifts off into a low hover , while check ing that\
  \ the \nload is not limiting control movement to hold the helicopter level and there\
  \ is still a \nmargin of power available.  \n3.101.  The type certificate limits\
  \ are defined for many reasons and are not necessarily the \nsame as the maximum\
  \ load that can be lifted in the environmental conditions at the \ntime. Exceeding\
  \ the aircraft weight limitations introduces fatigue  that may then \nshorten the\
  \ operational life of some components. Some helicopter  type certificates  \nallow\
  \ a higher loading if part of the load is external and can be jettisoned  (not \n\
  applicable to the BK117) . Some helicopters also have sufficient power at sea level\
  \ to \nlift more than the maximum rated internal load. Therefore, a dynamic check\
  \ will \nestablish that the helicopter can be flown, but not if it  is overloaded.\
  \  \n3.102.  The pilot said that their iBal Rotary  calculation of weight and balance\
  \ for the accident \nflight was on their phone lost and at sea. They recreated one\
  \ from memory . The \nrecreated loading calculation showed that the he licopter\
  \ was within weight and \nbalance limits,  but it did not match the actual weights\
  \ . Table 2 below shows the main \ndifferences  between the pilot's recreated estimate\
  \ and the calculated loading shown \nin Appendix 2.   \nTable 2: Diffe rences in\
  \ loading estimates  \nItem Pilot estimate  Measured or estimate d \nMain fuel \
  \ 520 kg - 90% capacity  576 kg -100%  capacity  \nExtended range tank  162 kg (1\
  \ external pod with \n100%  fuel plus an extra 9 kg ) 320 kg (2 external pods with\
  \ \n100%  fuel in both ) \nCargo  280 kg 353 kg \n \n3.103.  The medivac configuration\
  \ loading guide (Appendix 1) showed the maximum load \nthat could be carried over\
  \ the standard role equipment fitted for that configuration \nand remain within\
  \  the helicopter's  loading limits . The guide included an allowance of \n100 kilograms\
  \ for the pilot.  With 100 per cent fuel and two external long-range fuel \npods\
  \ , also with 100 pe r cent fuel, this additional discretionary load was 166 kilograms\
  \ \nof cargo .  \n3.104.  The recovered items were weighed and the weight of other\
  \  items  not available were \nestimated from discussions with the operator. The\
  \ calculated helicopter loading is \ngiven  in Appendix 2  and shows that it was\
  \ approximately 295 kilograms over the \nmaximum allowable weight of 3350 kilograms\
  \ when the helicopter departed \nInvercargill . It would take approximately one\
  \  hour of flight time to burn that excess \nweight  in fuel.  \n3.105.  The overload\
  \ was slightly less at  initial take -off from Te Anau because the winch \noperator\
  \ was not on board. After the 27 -minute flight to Athol, the fuel burn would \n\
  \ \nFinal Report AO -2019 -005 \n<< Page 44 >>\n   have c ompensated for the winch\
  \ operator boarding so the helicopter would again be \nsimilar to the take -off\
  \ weight at Te Anau .   \n3.106.  Assuming that all fuel tanks would have been refilled\
  \ to 100 per cent for the return \nflight  from Auckland Islands , the weight of\
  \ the me divac patient would have been \nadditional to that calculated loading.\
  \  \n3.107.  The task was at the limits of the helicopter's capability and endurance\
  \ . With the \namount of fuel required for the long-distance  flight to Auckland\
  \ Islands , and the crew \nand equipment carried on board , the flight was only\
  \ possible by exceeding  the \nmaximum certified all -up weight.  \n3.108.  The\
  \ airworthiness and life -cycle of an aircraft structure and its components are\
  \ \nevaluated by aircraft manufacturers based on operations within the prescribed\
  \ \nlimitations found documented in the Aircraft Flight Manual. Exceeding  aircraft\
  \ weight \nlimitations increases the risk of fatigue failures occurring at a lower\
  \ life limit or \ninspection interval than that published by the manufacturer .\
  \ \nLife-raft and survival equipment  \nSafety issue: For a  life-raft to be an\
  \ effective device for increasing the chance of survival in the \nevent of a ditching,\
  \ it must also be easily extracted from the aircraft so it may be deployed \nwhen\
  \ needed in an emergency . \n3.109.  The life-raft was a n aviation -style life-raft.\
  \ Certification under FAA TSO -C70a  meant \nthat it had a survival kit inside \
  \ with food and other emergency items . As a 'Type II ' \nlife-raft it was intended\
  \ for CTOs , but not for transport category aircraft  (passenger s), \nand it was\
  \ therefore correctly matched to this type of  operation.  \n3.110.  The TSO -C70\
  \ includes requirements for the life-raft and container , its colour  and \nmarking\
  \ . The operating instructions must be printed on the outside of the container \n\
  and visible when stowed.  The retaining line  is usually attached to the aircraft\
  \ to \nprevent the life -raft from floating away . The life -raft pack is then thrown\
  \ away from \nthe aircraft . A survivor must reach the floatin g life -raft pack,\
  \ lift the cover flap to \nexpose  a red handle attached to a lanyard, and pull\
  \ the red handle until the life -raft \ninflates.  \n3.111.  CAR rule 91.525 sets\
  \ out the requirements for New Zealand air operations over water.  \nIt states that\
  \ life preservers, l ife-rafts, signalling devices, ELT(S) and Emergency \nPosition\
  \ -Indicating Radio ( EPIRB ) must be installed in conspicuously identified \nlocations\
  \ and must be easily accessible in the event of an aircraft ditching . Life \npreservers,\
  \ including constant wear anti -exposure overalls (immersion suits) , must \nmeet\
  \ the requirements set out in Appendix A.14 of CAR Part 91.  \n3.112.  In this accident,\
  \ impact with the water was at night, unexpected  and sudden.  The \nhelicopter\
  \ lay semi -submerged in an inverted attitude for a short period  and then \nsank.\
  \ The life -raft was loaded into the rear cargo area amongst the rest of the \n\
  provisions for that rescue flight.  After rescuing the winch operator, the paramedic\
  \  \ntried to extract the life -raft from the cargo area , but could not find it\
  \  before the \nhelicopter sank.  The crew were wearing full im mersion suits and\
  \ life -jackets.  \n3.113.  The crew had emergency location and communications \
  \ devices  in a grab -bag in the \ncargo area , but no t on their person. This grab\
  \ -bag was also lost with the helicopter.  \n \n  Final Report AO -2019 -005 \n\

  \ that operators need to \naddress. They must ensure that emergency equipment is\
  \ available for the crew to use \nin an emergency and that all survival equipment\
  \ can be used effectively. The safety \nfactors include:  \n\u2022 The type of life-raft\
