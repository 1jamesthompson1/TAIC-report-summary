- name: NVG Illusions and Spatial Disorientation
  explanation: The theme of NVG illusions and spatial disorientation is highly relevant to this accident as the pilot was likely deceived by a visual illusion commonly experienced over calm water, which can affect judgment of height and spatial orientation when using Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). This illusion led to a loss of vertical reference and resulted in a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident. The document states, "the pilot met the minimum recency requirement for NVG operations, but was likely deceived by a well-documented visual illusion with NVGs caused by a low contrast surface" (4.5). Furthermore, it is mentioned that "it is commonly experienced over calm water and can affect judgment of height and spatial orientation" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), indicating the direct impact of NVG illusions on the accident.
- name: Inadequate Regulatory Framework for NVIS Operations
  explanation: The theme of an inadequate regulatory framework for Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) operations is pertinent to this accident as the existing regulations and risk controls defined by the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and NVIS operations were found to be outdated and not fit for purpose. The investigation found that "The New Zealand CAA risk controls that define the minimum safety requirements for HAA and NVIS operations significantly lag other jurisdictions and are no longer fit for purpose" (4.8). This indicates that the regulatory environment did not provide sufficient guidance or performance expectations to manage the risks associated with NVIS operations effectively.
- name: Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training Deficiencies
  explanation: The theme of Crew Resource Management (CRM) training deficiencies is relevant to this accident due to the lack of comprehensive CRM training qualifications for non-pilot crew members acting as NVIS crew. The investigation highlighted that "The potential for CRM to be an effective risk control with non-pilot NVIS crew members in a single-pilot, VFR, Part 135 operation is undermined by the current rule" (4.10). The document also states that "CAR Part 135 does not set a clear expectation about the role and duties of a non-pilot NVIS crew member, or define an appropriate level of CRM competence that could contribute to the safety of an NVIS flight" (4.10). This indicates that the CRM training was not adequate to ensure effective communication and decision-making during the flight.
- name: Overloading of the Helicopter
  explanation: The theme of overloading the helicopter is relevant as the aircraft departed for the flight in an overloaded condition, exceeding the maximum certified weight limit by approximately 300 kg. This is a significant safety factor as it can affect the aircraft's performance and handling characteristics. The report states, "The helicopter departed for this flight in an overloaded condition, exceeding the maximum certified weight limit by almost 300 kg" (4.12). Overloading is a known risk that can have serious implications for flight safety.
- name: Inadequate Emergency Equipment Accessibility
  explanation: The theme of inadequate emergency equipment accessibility is relevant to this accident as the crew, despite being provided with appropriate emergency survival equipment, were unable to locate some of this equipment after the helicopter impacted the sea. The report notes, "Although the helicopter and crew were provided with the appropriate emergency survival equipment and crew training for this operation, they were unable to locate some of this equipment, despite it being accessible" (4.13). This indicates that the placement and accessibility of emergency equipment were not optimal for use in an actual emergency situation.
- name: Lack of Aural Alerting Function on Radio Altimeter
  explanation: The lack of an aural alerting function on the radio altimeter is a relevant safety theme as it is a recognized safety measure for NVIS operations that could have potentially alerted the pilot to the helicopter's proximity to the sea surface. The investigation found that "the aircraft's radio altimeter was not required to be fitted with an aural alerting function. This function provides significant safety protections for pilots wearing NVGs" (4.9). The absence of such an alert could have contributed to the pilot's lack of awareness of the helicopter's altitude, leading to the CFIT accident.
