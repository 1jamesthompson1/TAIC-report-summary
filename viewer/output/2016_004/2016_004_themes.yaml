- name: Manufacturing Defects
  explanation: Manufacturing defects are a critical safety theme as they can lead to unforeseen equipment failures during operation. In this accident, the "number 4 cylinder upper spark plug had been manufactured incorrectly" (4.2), which was a direct cause of the in-flight fire. The spark plug's insulator was not swaged during manufacturing, leading to its ejection after 121 hours of service (4.4). This defect was not detected during quality control checks, highlighting the importance of robust manufacturing processes and inspections to ensure the reliability of critical components.
- name: Quality Control in Supply Chain
  explanation: The quality control in the supply chain is a safety theme that ensures parts are genuine and meet the required standards before being installed in aircraft. In this case, the spark plugs passed through several agents, including automotive suppliers, before reaching the aviation parts supplier (4.11). Although the failed spark plug was confirmed to be a genuine part (4.11), the incident raises concerns about the traceability and inspection of parts within the aviation supply chain. The fact that "spark plugs generally do not have individual or batch identifying marks" (4.11) complicates the traceability and quality assurance of such components.
- name: Component Certification and Usage Approval
  explanation: Component certification and usage approval are vital to ensure that all parts used in aviation are suitable for their intended use. The DENSO W24EMR-C spark plug was "not approved" for use on aircraft according to the manufacturer, yet it was used in the helicopter's ignition system (4.17). EASA's position that the approval of a part like a spark plug is always as part of an engine, not independently, indicates a potential gap in the certification process (4.19). This theme is relevant as it questions the adequacy of the certification process in verifying the suitability of components for aviation use.
- name: Pilot Response to Emergency Situations
  explanation: The pilot's response to emergency situations is a safety theme that can significantly affect the outcome of an incident. In this accident, the "pilot's prompt actions were appropriate and commendable" (5.3), as the immediate landing prevented a more serious outcome. This theme is relevant because it underscores the importance of pilot training and decision-making in successfully managing in-flight emergencies.
- name: Fire Risk Management
  explanation: Fire risk management is a safety theme that involves the prevention, detection, and suppression of fires in aircraft. The in-flight fire in this incident was initiated by the ejection of the spark plug insulator, which led to hot combustion gases impinging on combustible materials (5.1, 5.2). The proximity of flammable components like the fibreglass baffling and carbon-fibre fuselage to potential ignition sources (4.6) highlights the need for careful design and maintenance practices to mitigate the risk of fire.
- name: Rare Component Failure Implications
  explanation: The implications of rare component failures are a safety theme that considers the broader impact of infrequent but potentially catastrophic events. Although the type of spark plug failure in this accident is "so rare that it does not have significant implications for aviation safety" (5.6), it still resulted in a serious incident. This theme is relevant as it prompts the industry to consider how to address low-probability, high-impact events, including the potential need for changes in design, maintenance, or operational procedures to prevent recurrence.
