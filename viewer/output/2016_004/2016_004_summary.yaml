- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of fatigue or overwork contributing to the accident in the provided document. The pilot's actions were described as "prompt" and "commendable" (5.3), which suggests that fatigue was not a factor.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not indicate that human error or assumptions played a role in the accident. The spark plug failed due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5), not because of an individual's incorrect judgment or assumption.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence in the document to suggest that a lack of training or competency contributed to the accident. The pilot's actions were appropriate (5.3), and the failure was due to a manufacturing issue (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment was a contributing factor. The pilot managed the emergency landing successfully (4.1), and the spark plug failure was unrelated to the pilot's familiarity with the equipment (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in the accident, as the document focuses on a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5) and does not discuss crew interactions or decision-making processes.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not indicate that a failure to adhere to safety procedures contributed to the accident. The spark plug failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5), not a deviation from safety protocols.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of organizational safety culture affecting the accident. The failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the spark plug (4.4, 4.5), not organizational practices or behaviors.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not discuss risk management and analysis as a contributing factor. The spark plug failure was a rare manufacturing defect (4.2, 4.13), not a risk that was improperly managed or analyzed.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Regulatory oversight and compliance do not appear to be contributing factors. The spark plug was a genuine part approved by the relevant airworthiness authority (5.5), and the failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Situational awareness was not a contributing factor to the accident. The pilot was able to land the helicopter without injury (4.1), and the spark plug failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Emergency response preparedness was not a contributing factor. The pilot's actions during the emergency were appropriate (5.3), and the failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While the spark plug failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5), the document mentions that the lack of swaging was not detected during installation (4.14). This suggests a potential oversight in inspection, although it is noted that such a defect would not have been obvious (4.14).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The use of automation is not mentioned as a contributing factor in the accident. The failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the spark plug (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Weather conditions and decision-making were not factors in the accident. The spark plug failure was due to a manufacturing defect (4.4, 4.5), and there is no mention of weather affecting the incident.
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence of communication breakdown contributing to the accident. The failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the spark plug (4.4, 4.5).
- name: Other
  percentage: 90
  explanation: The primary cause of the accident was a manufacturing defect in the spark plug, which was not swaged during the manufacturing process (4.4, 4.5). This is a unique factor not covered by the predefined safety themes. The rarity of this type of failure (4.2, 4.13) and the fact that it was a genuine part approved for use (5.5) suggest that this was an isolated incident not characteristic of broader safety themes.
