  4.1. The accident  occurred without warning during the second flight of the day\
  \ .  The pilot's prompt \nactions en abled him to land and vacate the helicopter\
  \ without  injury.   The helicopter remained \ncontrollable throughout  the emergency\
  \ landi ng. \n4.2. The investigation determined  that the number 4 cylinder upper\
  \ spark plug had been \nmanufactured incorrectly.  This type of failure is extremely\
  \ rare , and in a worldwide search no \nspark plugs with the same  fault were found\
  \ , either in service or held as s pares.  Because of \nthe action taken by the\
  \ CAA and EASA  (see section 6), no further safety action was required.  \n4.3.\
  \ The following analysis discuss es what happened and why the spark plug failed\
  \  after only 121 \nhours in service . \nWhat happened  \n4.4. The insulator for\
  \ th e number 4 cylinder upper spark plug was not swaged during the \nmanufacturing\
  \ process, but it was initially held in place by a tight fit and an adhesive \n\
  compound.  However, after 121 hours of service the adhesive compound could not hold\
  \ \nagainst the pressure  within the cylinder  and the insulator was ejected . \
  \ The insulator almost \ncertainly  penetrated  the fibre glass  baffling.  The\
  \ insulator from the spark plug was n ot found.  \n4.5. Hot combustion gases would\
  \ have escape d through the hole created by the missing insula tor, \nbut the restrictive\
  \  aperture retained  a level of back pressure  in the cylinder .  This back \n\
  pressure , coupled with the  continuous ignition from the lower spark plug,  would\
  \ have \nmaintained the combustion process in the cylinder .  The unmuffled combustio\
  \ n gases  would \nhave generated the continuous and regular 'clattering' described\
  \ by the pilot and witnesses.  \nThe same noise was heard during the testing conducted\
  \ by the Commission.  \n4.6. A jet of flame , at approximately 870\xBA C, would\
  \ have been  emitted from the hole in the upper \nspark plug shell  and have imping\
  \ ed like a blowtorch flame  directly onto the fibreglass \nbaffling .12  Once the\
  \ fibreglass resin  was burning , the air from the engine -driven fan would \nhave\
  \ provided a continu ous source of oxygen to sustain the fire.  The carbon fibre\
  \ fuselage \nstructure , less than 20 cm away,  would have ignited readily when\
  \ it was exposed to the \nburning fibreglass.  \n4.7. The fire progressed throughout\
  \ the engine compartment , burning rubber -insulated \ncomponents .  This was very\
  \ likely the source of  the 'burn ing rubber ' smell noticed by the pilot.   \n\
  A few minutes after the helicopter landed , the fire bypassed the forward firewall\
  \ and  ignited  \nthe fuel tank. \n4.8. Other possible ignition sources for the\
  \ fire were considered, including a partial failu re of the \ndrive belt, the failure\
  \ of another drive component and chaffing.  None of these scenarios \nexplained\
  \ all of the symptoms described by the pilot, including the noise, no noticeable\
  \ loss of \npower and no warning indications.  \nSpark plug  \n4.9. The W24EMR -C\
  \ spark plug was originally designed by DENSO in 1991 for use in motorcycle  \n\
  engine s.  In about 1992, Light Speed  Engineering  determined that the plug was\
  \  suitable for its \naviation ignition system s.  Light Speed Engineering  advised\
  \ that  it had sold 80,000 DENS O \nspark plugs with its plasma ignition systems,\
  \ which , since 1988, had been installed  in aircraft \nengines ranging from 65\
  \ horsepower to 650 horsepower.   The Light Speed Engineering  \n              \
  \                                          \n12 The manufacturer advised that an\
  \ epoxy resin with equivalent properties to the epoxy used in the \nconstruction\
  \ of the baffling had a flash point greater than 150\xBAC and an auto -ignition\
  \ temperature of more \nthan 450\xBAC.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2016 -004 \n<< Page\
  \ 13 >>\n ignition system and W24EMR -C spark plugs were specified parts  of the\
  \ Cabri when  it was \ncertificated by EASA  in 2007 .13   \n4.10.  The four DENSO\
  \  spark plugs found  fitted to the engine  had all be en installed  in November\
  \ \n2015 , as the previous spark plug s were a pproaching  the 200 -hour limit.\
  \  The four spark plugs \nhad been  taken from stock held by the maintenance provider\
  \ and had been part of a larger \nconsignment sourced from an approved aviation\
  \ parts supplier.14  The parts supplier advised \nthat as part of its quality control\
  \ it occasionally inspected  individual spark plugs within each  \nbatch pr ior\
  \ to issuing a release note.  \n4.11.  Spark plugs generally do not have individual\
  \ or batch identifying marks t hat would  enable \nthem to be traced back to the\
  \ manufacture rs.  However, d ocumentation revealed that  the \ninstalled  spark\
  \ plugs had passed through several  agents, including automotive suppliers in \n\
  Australia and New Zealand , before reaching the aviation parts supplier .  The link\
  \ between the \nmanufacturer and Australia could not be established and therefore\
  \ the production date could \nnot be identified .  Althoug h counterfeit automotive\
  \ spark plugs are reportedly  manufactured in \nlarge quantities overseas , the\
  \ DENSO  representatives who examined the four spark plugs \nwere confident that\
  \ they were genuine parts.  This was later confirmed by DENSO  Japan.   \n4.12.\
  \  DENSO  contend ed that because of its quality control procedures, it would have\
  \ been \nimpossible for the failed spark plug to leave  the factory unswaged.  DENSO\
  \  believed that t he \nspark plug must have become unswaged during its 121 hours\
  \ in service.  However, a \nmetallurg ical examination of the spark plug disproved\
  \  that hypothesis  as it showed that the \ngrain structure around the area of the\
  \ boss had not been altered since its manufacture.  The \nchange in grain structure\
  \ associated with the swaging process was absent , confirmi ng that the \nfailed\
  \ plug  had never been swaged.   Further, in the test performed by Guimbal , despite\
  \ \napplying a flame at over 1,000\xBAC, there was no deformation of the swaging\
  \ . \n4.13.  The manufacturing process described by the DENSO  representatives include\
  \ d a number  of \nquality assurance checks.  However, because of the relatively\
  \ small number of W24EMR -C \nspark plugs produced , between about 1,000 and 3,000\
  \  annually , the assembly process and \nquality control were intensively  manual.\
  \  Th at left  open the opportunity for human error.  No \nother faulty spark plugs\
  \ were found , which tended to  confirm that the failure rate was \nextremely low.\
  \  \n4.14.  The lack of swaging was obvious if the known defective  number 4 cylinder\
  \ upper spark plug \nwas compared to similar spark plugs , but not wh en the plug\
  \ was viewed on its own .  The \nengineer who had last installed the set of spark\
  \ plug s had not detect ed the anomaly , but  their \nvigilance was  likely to have\
  \ been typical for any person performing th at task.  The authenticity \nand integrity\
  \ of the spa rk plug would likely not have been in question, as it was a simple\
  \ \nproprietary standard part, supplied new by an approved agent and accompanied\
  \ by the \nappropriate documentation.  \n4.15.  The investigation identif ied several\
  \ cases  of other types of spark plug  failing on motor vehicles \nand motorcycles\
  \ .  However, th ose were  found to have been caused by  broken insulators, \nprobably\
  \ as a result of  the spark plug s being  dropped.   \n4.16.  The engine manufacturer\
  \ advised that a complete ejection of the centre insulator was a rare \noccurrence\
  \ in aviation .  In those cases , fatigue cracking of the crimped flange on the\
  \ spark \nplug body allowed the insulator to be ejected under pressure.   That scenario\
  \ differ ed from the \nmode of failure in this incident  and generally had involved\
  \ spark plu gs that had a very high \ntime in service . \n4.17.  During the investigation\
  \ DENSO  advised that it did not supply sparks plugs to Guimbal for use \non the\
  \ Cabri.  The company later submitted that its subsidiary companies had not sold\
  \ spark \nplugs to Guimbal or Light Spe ed Engineering.  The DENSO  product catalogue\
  \ stated that the \nW24EMR -C spark plug was 'not approved ' for use on aircraft.\
  \  DENSO  advised in January \n2017 that the catalogue had been updated to state\
  \ that DENSO  spark plugs were 'prohibited ' \n                                \

  \ t hat DENSO  produced 'automobile spark plugs which meet ISO \n[International\
  \ Organization for Standardization] related only [to] automobile specs '. \n4.18.\
  \  Guimbal advised that the W24EMR -C spark plugs were purchased directly from DENSO\
  \  \nNetherlands or DENSO  France , who were fully aware that the spark plugs were\
  \ being installed \nin aircraft engines.  Light Speed Engineering also said that\
  \ DENSO  was aware that the spark \nplugs were being used in aircraft engines .\
  \  \n4.19.  EASA advised that t he statement of a manufacturer that a product is\
  \ not approved for use in \naviation 'is a commercial statement without relevance\
  \ for certification, because e.g. spark \nplugs have no independent \"aviation approval\
  \ \" from an aviation authority and are always \napproved as part of an engine.\
  \ The refore, it is up to the TC [Type Certificate] or STC \n[Supplementary Type\
  \ Certificate] holder to show that the chosen part is suitable for the \nintended\
  \ use '.  Neither Guimbal nor EASA intended to stop the use of the DENSO  W24EMR\
  \ -C \nspark plug with the Light Speed Engineering  ignition system.  \n \n  \n\
