The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view  to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqui ries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regu latory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 15 April 2016 , a pilot was on a solo navigation  training fl ight in the central North Island in a 
Hélicopt ères Guimbal Cabri G2 helicopter.  S hortly  after taking off from Rotorua he heard a 
loud bang followed by a continuous clattering noise.  Soon afterwards,  smoke enter ed the 
cabin.   
1.2. The pilot landed immediate ly and vacated the helicopter .  The pilot was not injured , but the 
helicopter was  destroyed  by fire.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) found  that the in -flight fire 
was initiated by the  ejection of a ceramic insulator and centr e electrode from one of the 
engine spark plugs.  The loss of the spark plug allowed the combustion flame from that 
cylinder to ignite  the engine cooling shroud.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the failed spark plug was a genuine part that had been  
approved by the relevant airworthiness authority for use as a part of the helicopter's ignition 
system, but it failed because it had not been swaged during the manufacturing process.   
Swaging was the process required to bend the cold metal into place to hold in the  insulator.  
1.5. This type of failure with spark plugs is so rare that it does not have significant 
implications for aviation safety.  
1.6. The pilot's prompt actions were appropriate and commendable.  The immediate landing , 
combined with the protection provided by the engine bay firewall , prevented a more serious 
outcome.   
1.7. The Commission issued  no recommendation s.  The safety action s taken by the Civil Aviation 
Authority of New Zealand and the manufacturer of the helicopter , in conjunction with the 
European Avia tion Safety A gency , were considered sufficient  to identify other defective spark 
plugs . 
1.8. The key lesson  arising from the inquiry was that maintenance personnel need to be vigilant for 
product anomalies  when installing components onto aircraft, even when the  components  
come from approved supplier s.

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At 1640  on Friday  15 April 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) of the occurrence .  The 
Commiss ion opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in charge . 
2.2. On 16 April 2016 , an investigation team travelled to Rotorua.  The on -site examination was 
commenced the same da y. 
2.3. On 17 April 2016 , the wreckage was removed from the accident site w ith the support of the 
New Zealand Fire Service and its hazardous materials unit.2  The wreckage was  transported to 
the Commission's Wellington technical  facility  in a sealed container , where a more detailed 
examination was completed .  Commission investigators also interviewed local witnesses and 
the pilot . 
2.4. On 18 April 2016 , the investigators  travelled to Tauranga to collect the aircraft maintenance 
records, interview maintenance staff an d inspect  other Hélicopt ères Guimbal (Guimbal) Cabri 
G2 (Cabri) helicopters .  The pilot's instructor  was interviewed later the same day in Taupo .  
2.5. On 22 April 2016 , the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses  (BEA) of France  appointed an 
Accredited Representative to the inquiry in accordance with the provisions of Annex 13 to the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation .3  The Accredited Representative appointed a 
specialist from Guimbal as a technical advisor .  
2.6. On 30 May  2016 , at the request of the Commission , the Japan Transport Safety Board , as the 
representative of the state of manufacture of the spark plug,  appointed  one of its investigator s 
to assist with technical enquiries related to the investigation.  
2.7. On 1 August  2016 , the Commission advised the CAA of co ncerns regarding the DENSO 
Corporation  of Japan  (DENSO)  W24EMR -C spark plug installed  on the engine.  On 10 August 
2016 , the CAA issued a Continuing Airworthiness Notice regarding  that model of spark plug.4  
On 30 September 2016 , the European Aviation Safe ty Agency  (EASA) , the airworthiness 
authority for the Cabri helicopter, issued a Service Information Bulletin recommending  that all 
operators of Cabri helicopters inspect DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plugs for serviceability.5 
2.8. On 6 October  2016 , two Commission inv estigators travelled to Rotorua to supervise a series of 
tests conducted by the New Zealand Lycoming field representative.  The tests used the same 
type of engine and the same model of spark plug that had been  installed on the accident 
helicopter.  
2.9. On 11 an d 12 January 2017, two representatives of DENSO  Japan , the manufacturer of the 
spark plug , visited the Commission .  They  inspected the wreckage and examined the spark 
plugs removed from the engine , and gave a presentation on the production process for the 
subject spark plugs.  
2.10.  On 23 March 2017 , Quest Integrity  NZL Limited completed a metallurgical examination and 
failure assessment of the DENSO  spark plug s installed on the engine.   Guimbal and DENSO  
were invited to comment on the metallurgy report  prepared by Quest .   
2.11.  On 28 July  2017 , the Commission approved a draft  report for circulation to interested persons 
for comment.   The Commission has considered the submissions received and any changes as 
a result of those submissions have been included in this report . 
2.12.  On 27 September 2017 , the Commission approved the report for publication.  
                                                        
2 The helicopter structure was primarily carbon -reinforced fibre, which is very hazardous when burnt.  
3 France, as the state of man ufacture of the helicopter, was entitled to participate in the investigation.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. History of the flight  
3.1.1.  On Thursday 14 April 2016, the day before the occurrence, the pilot and his  instructor had 
flown  the Guimbal Cabri , registered  ZK-IIH (the helicopter) , on a 2.7 -hour instructional 
navigation flight from Taupo to the Wairarapa area.  They had return ed to Taupo the next 
morning , Friday 15 April .  The pilot then continued with  a solo navigation flight to consolidate 
the earlier lessons .  The in tended route was from Taupo to  Rotorua, Whakatane , Galatea and 
back to Taupo  (Figure 1).  The pilot refuelled the helicopter full y, completed a pre -flight 
inspection  and departed Taupo at about 1455 .6 
 
Figure 1 
Planned route  
3.1.2.  At 1525 , the helicopter arrived at Rotorua.  The pilot landed and prepare d for the next leg of 
the flight , and  sent a text message to his instructor to advise his  progress.  The helicopter 
departed from Rotorua at 1532 , flying directly towards Whakatane.  
3.1.3.  The pilot said he maintain ed a steady climb at 80 knots7 using  a power setting of 80 %.  Less 
than 90 seconds after take -off he hear d a loud bang followed by a 'continuous clatter '.  He 
advised the aerodrome tower that he had an engine problem and was returni ng to the 
aerodrome .  During this time he entered a left turn  towards the aerodrome and start ed a 
descent  at the same power setting .  He scanned the instruments and saw no warning s and no  
indication of a low main rotor speed .  
3.1.4.  The pilot said that immediate ly after calling the tower he smel led smoke and soon thereafter 
saw smoke in the cabin .  The smoke initially smel led like burning rubber .  The pilot advised the 
tower that he was landing immediately and requested assistance.  He landed in  a paddock on 
a ridgeline , using power  for the landing .  He said he had  no difficult y controlling the helicopter .  
                                                        
6 Timings are based on the pilot's recollection and the air traffic service's tower recordings and radar data.

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 The pilot shut down the engine with  the mixture control lever , then turned off the  ignition , fuel 
pump and electrical master control  before he  vacated the heli copter  uninjured . 
3.1.5.  Occupants of a house adjacent  to the paddock  were alerted to the approaching helicopter by  
the unusual sound  it was making . They saw the helicopter fly past the house and heard  what 
they described as a  'clattering ' sound. One witness  captured a five-second  video recording of 
the helicopter after it landed in the paddock.  The witnesses saw smoke being emitted from 
around the engine area of the helicopter , and the  intensity of the smoke increase rapidly 
around the mast area at the  top of the  helicopter .  After the pilot had escaped, the helicopter  
was quickly engulfed in flames .  The still frame s in Figures 2 and 3  are from the video  
recording .

3.2. Personnel  information  
3.2.1.  The pilot held a private pilot licence (aeroplane)  that had been  issued in 1984.  He had 
accrued 303 fli ght hours , but had not flown aeroplanes regularly in recent years.  In July 2015 , 
he had started flying helicopters with the intention of obtaining his private pilot licence 
(helicopter).   
3.2.2.  The pilot had flown  a total of 67.3 hours in helicopters at the ti me of the occurrence , with all  
but 3.4 flight hours in the Cabri.  He was at the stage of completing his cross -country and 

 

<< Page 6 >>
 Final Report AO -2016 -004 mountain flying training before preparing for the flight test  for the issue of the licence.   The 
occurrence flight was a solo consoli dation of exercises covered  so far .   
3.2.3.  The pilot held a current Class 2 medical certificate and said he was in good health and fit to fly 
at the time of the occurrence.  
3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  The Cabri was a two -seat light helicopter, powered by a Lycoming O -360-J2A four  cylinder 
piston engine , first certificated in late 2007 .  Engine power was delivered to the main gearbox 
by a single , 70-millimetre  (mm) wide , heavy -duty rubber drive belt connecting lower and upper 
sheaves8 (see Figure 5) .  The upper sh eave transmit ted power through a free -wheeling unit to 
the main and tail rotor gearboxes.  Belt tension was controlled by a hydraulic actuator that 
used engine oil pressure to move the engine, and therefore the lower sheave, about a pivot 
point.  
 
Figure 5 
Engine configuration    
3.3.2.  The helicopter structure, apart from the engine frame, firewall and landing gear, was 
composed  almost entirely of carbon -fibre  composite materials.  The main rotor blades  were  
also constructed of carb on fibre .  A fan positioned at the front of the engine provide d cooling 
air that was forced around the engine by a fibreglass9 baffling , or shroud , positioned over the 
engine .  Hot air was then directed down and away from the helicopter.  
3.3.3.  Like nearly all a eronautical piston engines, each cylinder had two spark plugs.  The engine was 
fitted with a dual ignition system.  A conventional magneto10 fired the lower spark plugs on 
each cylinder , while  a separate plasma , or electronic capacitor discharge , ignition s ystem f ired 
the upper spark plugs. The two systems used d ifferent spark plugs .  The plasma system , 
manufactured by Light Speed Engineering used DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plugs , had small er-
                                                        
8 A sheave is a  pulley with a grooved wheel for holding a belt, wire rope or rope.  
9 The baffling was made of 'glass fabric 300g/m2 with Epoxy resin Axson Epolam 2022', sometimes called 
glass -fibre -reinforced plastic or glass -reinforced plastic.

 diameter threaded base s so require d adapter s when installed on the Lycom ing engine .  The 
W24EMR -C spark plug s also ha d different wear characteristics and had to be replaced after 
200 hours of use.   
3.3.4.  ZK-IIH had been  manufactured in France in April 2010.  The helicopter had initially been 
registered and flown in Germany before b eing imported to New Zealand in June 2015.  The 
CAA had inspected the helicopter, determined that it conformed to the type certificate issued 
by EASA , and issued it with a New Zealand Airworthiness Certificate.  
3.3.5.  An examination of the maintenance records for  the helicopter confirmed that it had been  
maintained in accordance with its approved maintenance schedule.  There were no reported 
defects that were considered relevant to this occurrence.   The W24EMR -C spark plugs had 
been most recently replaced on 2 Nov ember 2015 and ha d accrued 121 hours of use. 
3.4. Site and wreckage  information  
3.4.1.  The helicopter landed in a grassed paddock near the crest of a gentle slope, 2.8 km from 
Rotorua Aerodrome.  The nearest building, a farmhouse, was about 100 m etres  away.  
3.4.2.  The fire consumed most of the helicopter, leaving only the aft portion of the tail boom , 
including the tail rotor,  undamaged.   Several muffled explosions were heard  during the course 
of the fire.  These were likely to have been an exploding  can of window cleaner st ored in the 
locker behind the pilot , and the rupturing of the fuel tank.  The fuel add ed to the intensity of 
the fire , which destroyed most of the non -metal lic components about the engine  and cabin .  
These included the drive belt, the rubber coating for th e electrical leads and much of the 
cooling fan, scroll, ducting and engine baffling . 
3.4.3.  The condition of the wreckage, in particular the state of the carbon -fibre ash, limited the 
examination of the wreckage at the site.  The wreckage was therefore removed an d taken to 
the Commission's technical facility for a more controlled and detailed examination.  During 
this examination it was discovered that the ceramic insulator containing the centre electrode 
for the number 4 cylinder  upper spark plug  was missing .  Only the spark plug  metal 'shell ' was 
left in the cylinder  (see Figure 6).

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report AO -2016 -004  
3.4.4.  A comparison  of the spark plug shell in the number 4 cylinder  and a new spark plug of the 
same  type revealed a marked  difference in the shape of the flange of the shell , which  is 
normally swaged ,11 or crimped , around the ceramic insulator  (see Figure 7).  
 
Figure 7 
Number 4  spark plug shell (on right) , flange not formed  
3.4.5.  Additionally, the spark plug shell was longer than the shell of a new spark plug and did not 
have the characteristic 'bulge' in the recess in the mid -section of the shell  (see Figure 8).  This 
bulge is made during manufacture when the shell is compressed in length  by approximately 
0.7 mm to form a tight internal seal  around the ceramic insulator .

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 3.5. Tests and resea rch 
Helicopter manufacturer  
3.5.1.  The helicopter manufacturer advised that it had performed a test to determine if the fire that 
erupted after landing could have caused the deformation seen on the number 4 cylinder 
upper spark plug.  A new spark plug had been  subjected to a high -temperature flame and 
monitored  for any change to the swaging .  No change was detected during this test.  
Engine test run  
3.5.2.  A Lycoming O-360 engine was installed on a test bed and initially run in normal configuration , 
with all eight spark p lugs of the same type and  in good condition .  The e ngine parameters , 
including revolutions per minute (RPM) , exhaust gas temperature  and torq ue were recorded 
for reference .  The engine was then shut down and the number 4 cylinder upper spark plug 
replaced with a DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plug using the standard adapter.  The ceramic 
insulator was removed from the spark plug to replicate the condition found after the accident.  
3.5.3.  The engine started without difficulty and, once stabilised, the RPM was steadily increa sed to 
maximum .  A distinctive 'clattering' noise was heard above the normal engine noise.  A flame , 
approximately  20 centimetres  (cm) in length , was emitted from the hole in the number 4 spark 
plug body.  Using heat -sensing equipment, t he temperature of t he flame was measured  to be 
approximately  870ºC.  This was about 300ºC hotter than the exhaust gas temperature 
measured during the initial  run.   
3.5.4.  The engine was determined to be capable of normal operation through the full RPM range with 
the vibration with in acceptable tolerances.  The e ngineering staff who manag ed this test 
estimated  there was a  power loss of about 15% with the defective spark plug installed.  See 
Appendix 1 for more detail  of the engine test.  
Metallurgy testing       
3.5.5.  A range of DENSO  W24EM R-C spark plugs  was subjected to  detailed metallurgical 
examination.  These included  the number 4 cylinder upper spark plug found after the accident  
and the other three DENSO  spark plug s from the engine .  The manufacturer provided  a new 
serviceable spark p lug and a n unswaged spark plug  taken from the relevant stage of the 
manufacturing process . 
3.5.6.  The number 4 cylinder upper spark plug and the new serviceable spark plug  both displayed 
the same circumferential markings typical of the machining  that would have t aken place 
during the initial stages of manufacture .  The profile s of both spark plugs  were also the same.  
There was no evidence of any mechanical deformation on the tapering boss for the number 4 
cylinder upper spark plug.  
3.5.7.  The number 4 cylinder upper spark plug, another used spark plug and the new swaged spark 
plug were cross -section ed to permit a comparison  of the ir microstructure s.  The examination 
found the following:  
  The micro structure s of the ex -service [used] and new swag ed spark plugs shows 
vertical grain structure and other microstructural features in the metal forming the hex.  
This is the original microstructural orientation of the material stock used in 
manufacture.  There is the obvious curvature and microstructural deformation from 
cold wor k in the swaged boss.  There was no difference in the microstructure for the 
new and ex -service swaged spark plugs.  The microstructure of the failed spark plug 
shows only the vertical inclusions in the hex material and extending into the tapered 
boss. No gross curvature or directional grain deformation from cold work was observed 
in the failed spark plug.  
  The lack of grain deformation in the failed spark plug provides evidence that the 
tapered boss at the top of the metal shell had neve r been swaged prio r to service.  (See 
Figures 10 and 11. )

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 4. Analysis  
Introduction  
4.1. The accident  occurred without warning during the second flight of the day .  The pilot's prompt 
actions en abled him to land and vacate the helicopter without  injury.   The helicopter remained 
controllable throughout  the emergency landi ng. 
4.2. The investigation determined  that the number 4 cylinder upper spark plug had been 
manufactured incorrectly.  This type of failure is extremely rare , and in a worldwide search no 
spark plugs with the same  fault were found , either in service or held as s pares.  Because of 
the action taken by the CAA and EASA  (see section 6), no further safety action was required.  
4.3. The following analysis discuss es what happened and why the spark plug failed  after only 121 
hours in service . 
What happened  
4.4. The insulator for th e number 4 cylinder upper spark plug was not swaged during the 
manufacturing process, but it was initially held in place by a tight fit and an adhesive 
compound.  However, after 121 hours of service the adhesive compound could not hold 
against the pressure  within the cylinder  and the insulator was ejected .  The insulator almost 
certainly  penetrated  the fibre glass  baffling.  The insulator from the spark plug was n ot found.  
4.5. Hot combustion gases would have escape d through the hole created by the missing insula tor, 
but the restrictive  aperture retained  a level of back pressure  in the cylinder .  This back 
pressure , coupled with the  continuous ignition from the lower spark plug,  would have 
maintained the combustion process in the cylinder .  The unmuffled combustio n gases  would 
have generated the continuous and regular 'clattering' described by the pilot and witnesses.  
The same noise was heard during the testing conducted by the Commission.  
4.6. A jet of flame , at approximately 870º C, would have been  emitted from the hole in the upper 
spark plug shell  and have imping ed like a blowtorch flame  directly onto the fibreglass 
baffling .12  Once the fibreglass resin  was burning , the air from the engine -driven fan would 
have provided a continu ous source of oxygen to sustain the fire.  The carbon fibre fuselage 
structure , less than 20 cm away,  would have ignited readily when it was exposed to the 
burning fibreglass.  
4.7. The fire progressed throughout the engine compartment , burning rubber -insulated 
components .  This was very likely the source of  the 'burn ing rubber ' smell noticed by the pilot.   
A few minutes after the helicopter landed , the fire bypassed the forward firewall and  ignited  
the fuel tank. 
4.8. Other possible ignition sources for the fire were considered, including a partial failu re of the 
drive belt, the failure of another drive component and chaffing.  None of these scenarios 
explained all of the symptoms described by the pilot, including the noise, no noticeable loss of 
power and no warning indications.  
Spark plug  
4.9. The W24EMR -C spark plug was originally designed by DENSO in 1991 for use in motorcycle  
engine s.  In about 1992, Light Speed  Engineering  determined that the plug was  suitable for its 
aviation ignition system s.  Light Speed Engineering  advised that  it had sold 80,000 DENS O 
spark plugs with its plasma ignition systems, which , since 1988, had been installed  in aircraft 
engines ranging from 65 horsepower to 650 horsepower.   The Light Speed Engineering  
                                                        
12 The manufacturer advised that an epoxy resin with equivalent properties to the epoxy used in the 
construction of the baffling had a flash point greater than 150ºC and an auto -ignition temperature of more 
than 450ºC.  
 
Final Report AO -2016 -004 
<< Page 13 >>
 ignition system and W24EMR -C spark plugs were specified parts  of the Cabri when  it was 
certificated by EASA  in 2007 .13   
4.10.  The four DENSO  spark plugs found  fitted to the engine  had all be en installed  in November 
2015 , as the previous spark plug s were a pproaching  the 200 -hour limit.  The four spark plugs 
had been  taken from stock held by the maintenance provider and had been part of a larger 
consignment sourced from an approved aviation parts supplier.14  The parts supplier advised 
that as part of its quality control it occasionally inspected  individual spark plugs within each  
batch pr ior to issuing a release note.  
4.11.  Spark plugs generally do not have individual or batch identifying marks t hat would  enable 
them to be traced back to the manufacture rs.  However, d ocumentation revealed that  the 
installed  spark plugs had passed through several  agents, including automotive suppliers in 
Australia and New Zealand , before reaching the aviation parts supplier .  The link between the 
manufacturer and Australia could not be established and therefore the production date could 
not be identified .  Althoug h counterfeit automotive spark plugs are reportedly  manufactured in 
large quantities overseas , the DENSO  representatives who examined the four spark plugs 
were confident that they were genuine parts.  This was later confirmed by DENSO  Japan.   
4.12.  DENSO  contend ed that because of its quality control procedures, it would have been 
impossible for the failed spark plug to leave  the factory unswaged.  DENSO  believed that t he 
spark plug must have become unswaged during its 121 hours in service.  However, a 
metallurg ical examination of the spark plug disproved  that hypothesis  as it showed that the 
grain structure around the area of the boss had not been altered since its manufacture.  The 
change in grain structure associated with the swaging process was absent , confirmi ng that the 
failed plug  had never been swaged.   Further, in the test performed by Guimbal , despite 
applying a flame at over 1,000ºC, there was no deformation of the swaging . 
4.13.  The manufacturing process described by the DENSO  representatives include d a number  of 
quality assurance checks.  However, because of the relatively small number of W24EMR -C 
spark plugs produced , between about 1,000 and 3,000  annually , the assembly process and 
quality control were intensively  manual.  Th at left  open the opportunity for human error.  No 
other faulty spark plugs were found , which tended to  confirm that the failure rate was 
extremely low.  
4.14.  The lack of swaging was obvious if the known defective  number 4 cylinder upper spark plug 
was compared to similar spark plugs , but not wh en the plug was viewed on its own .  The 
engineer who had last installed the set of spark plug s had not detect ed the anomaly , but  their 
vigilance was  likely to have been typical for any person performing th at task.  The authenticity 
and integrity of the spa rk plug would likely not have been in question, as it was a simple 
proprietary standard part, supplied new by an approved agent and accompanied by the 
appropriate documentation.  
4.15.  The investigation identif ied several cases  of other types of spark plug  failing on motor vehicles 
and motorcycles .  However, th ose were  found to have been caused by  broken insulators, 
probably as a result of  the spark plug s being  dropped.   
4.16.  The engine manufacturer advised that a complete ejection of the centre insulator was a rare 
occurrence in aviation .  In those cases , fatigue cracking of the crimped flange on the spark 
plug body allowed the insulator to be ejected under pressure.   That scenario differ ed from the 
mode of failure in this incident  and generally had involved spark plu gs that had a very high 
time in service . 
4.17.  During the investigation DENSO  advised that it did not supply sparks plugs to Guimbal for use 
on the Cabri.  The company later submitted that its subsidiary companies had not sold spark 
plugs to Guimbal or Light Spe ed Engineering.  The DENSO  product catalogue stated that the 
W24EMR -C spark plug was 'not approved ' for use on aircraft.  DENSO  advised in January 
2017 that the catalogue had been updated to state that DENSO  spark plugs were 'prohibited '

[International Organization for Standardization] related only [to] automobile specs '. 
4.18.  Guimbal advised that the W24EMR -C spark plugs were purchased directly from DENSO  
Netherlands or DENSO  France , who were fully aware that the spark plugs were being installed 
in aircraft engines.  Light Speed Engineering also said that DENSO  was aware that the spark 
plugs were being used in aircraft engines .  
4.19.  EASA advised that t he statement of a manufacturer that a product is not approved for use in 
aviation 'is a commercial statement without relevance for certification, because e.g. spark 
plugs have no independent "aviation approval " from an aviation authority and are always 
approved as part of an engine. The refore, it is up to the TC [Type Certificate] or STC 
[Supplementary Type Certificate] holder to show that the chosen part is suitable for the 
intended use '.  Neither Guimbal nor EASA intended to stop the use of the DENSO  W24EMR -C 
spark plug with the Light Speed Engineering  ignition system.

 5. Findings  
5.3. The pilot's prompt actions were appropriate and commendable.  The immediate l anding 
combined with  the protection provided by the engine bay firewall prevented a more serious  
outcome.    
5.4. The spark plug failed because it had not been swaged during the manufacturing process.  
  
  5.1. The in -flight fire was initiated by the ejection of the number 4 cylinder upper spark plug centre 
insulator.  
5.2. The engine continued to operate, which allowed hot combustion gases from the number 4 
cylinder to im pinge upon the combustible fibreglass baffling and then the carbon -fibre 
fuselage.  
5.5. The failed spark plug was a genuine part that had been  approved by the relevant 
airworthiness authority for use as a part of the helicopter's ignition system .  
5.6. This type of failure with spark plugs is so rare that it does not have significant implications for 
aviation safety.

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operat or to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normall y result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 10 August 2016, i n response to advice from the Commission , the Director of Civil Aviation 
issued C ontinuing Airworthiness Notice C AN 74 -002, which strongly recommend ed that 
operators/maintenance providers inspect all DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plugs , whether  
installed in engines or held in stock , for defects.  
6.3. On 1 September 2016 , EASA , as the airworthiness authority for the Guimbal Cabri he licopter, 
issued a S afety  Information Bulletin recommending that operators of Cabri helicopters inspect 
DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plugs for serviceability  (EASA, 2016) .  On the same day Guimbal 
issued Service Bulletin SB16 -022A, recommending that operators chec k all installed and new 
DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plugs, and repeat the inspection s at all installation s thereafter.  
Reference was made to the relevant sections of the maintenance manual for the helicopter.  
6.4. No other DENSO  spark plugs with this fault were iden tified , therefore the quality defect was an 
extremely rare occurrence.  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.5. None identified .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.  
7.2. In this case the Commission made no recommendation.  The action s taken by the CAA and the 
manufacturer of the helicopter, in conjunction with EASA , were considered sufficient to identify 
any other defective spark plugs.

 Final Report AO -2016 -004 Appendix 1 : Guimbal Cabri G2, engine test run, Rotorua, 6 October 2 016 
Objective  
The objective of the engine test run was to record data that would allow an assessment of the 
implications of operating the Lycoming O-360 engine fitted to the Guimbal Cabri G2 helicopter, with a 
defective DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plug in the number 4  cylinder upper position.  
Test procedure  
The engine test rig was equipped with a magnetic brake dynamometer and full digital diagnostic 
capabilities, allowing the recording and  plotting of all significant parameters during the engine run.  The 
test was performed by the New Zealand  Lycoming field representative . 
A DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plug had previously been prepared for the test procedure by removing the 
ceramic insulator from the spark plug shell.  An adaptor of the type normally used with the W24EMR -C 
spark plug had been sourced , which permitted the smaller -diameter , 12-mm automotive -type spark plug 
shell to be installed in place of the standard ¾ -inch (19 mm) aviation -type sp ark plug.  
A video camera was mounted to the rig in a suitable position to record the flame expected to be emitted 
from the aperture in the defective number 4  cylinder upper spark plug shell.   
At the commencement of the testing, the engine was initially ru n in the rig in normal configuration, i.e. 
with all upper spark plugs in good working order.  The parameters for this engine run were recorded for 
reference and comparative purposes.  
The engine was shut down and the number 4  cylinder upper spark plug was r emoved .  The adapter and 
the DENSO  W24EMR -C spark plug shell with the centre insulator removed w ere then fitted  (see Figure 
1).

<< Page 21 >>
 The engine was started again and once stabilised, the throttle was progressively increased .  A visible 
flame emitted from the spark plug body  and this  was recorded by a video camera mounted to the test 
rig (see Figure 2).  
At the end of the engine test run a still photograph was taken, with a tape measure placed adjacent to 
the path of the emitted flame (see Figure 3).  This allowed a n estimate  to be made of the  length of 
flame shown in the video recording.  
The parameters for both the reference run and the test run were recorded and compared . 
Although the temperature of th e flame was not able to be measured  directly , when the engine was 
running at the maximum test RPM of 2 ,700, the maximum stabilised temperature of the exhaust in the 
number  4 engine exhaust manifold was around 1 ,600ºF (870ºC).  This was 300ºF (150ºC) hotter  than 
the number 4 exhaust manifold temperature during  the reference engine run.  
The engine delivered a maximum 229 Nm (newton metres) of torque at 25 inches (6.35 cm) of manifold 
pressure during the datum engine run. During the test run the engine was pro ducing 120 Nm of torque 
at 19 inches  (4.83 cm) of manifold pressure.  The increasing number 4  cylinder head temperature 
required that the test run be terminated to prevent any engine damage.  
Findings  
 The engine was able to be started and run with the defec tive number 4  cylinder upper spark 
plug.  
 A jet of flame greater than 200  mm in length and a t a temperature of approximately  1,600ºF 
(870ºC)  was emitted from the hole in the number 4  cylinder upper spark plug body.  
 The engine was capable of normal operatio n through the RPM range and the levels of vibration 
observed when operating with a defective upper spark plug were acceptable . 
 The Lycoming field representative  estimated that the total engine power loss from the defective 
spark plug condition was in the o rder of 15%.
