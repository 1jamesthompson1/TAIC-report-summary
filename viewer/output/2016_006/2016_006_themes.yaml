- name: Wind Assessment and Approach Planning
  explanation: Wind assessment and approach planning is a critical safety theme in helicopter operations, especially in mountainous terrain. In this accident, the pilot made the final approach to the south, expecting a westerly crosswind, but the wind was actually from the north, resulting in a downwind approach. This misjudgment of wind direction and strength is a common challenge in mountain flying and can lead to reduced performance and control issues. The report states, "the pilot made the final approach to the south, expecting a westerly crosswind...the wind was from the north. therefore it was very likely that the landing approach was made downwind" (4.3.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The relevance of this theme is further emphasized by the fact that "It is usually preferable to land a helicopter into wind" (4.3.2), and the pilot's failure to confirm the anticipated wind direction led to a tight turn to a short final approach, which did not allow him time to confirm the anticipated wind (5.3).
- name: Helicopter Performance and Handling
  explanation: Helicopter performance and handling is a safety theme that encompasses the aircraft's ability to respond to pilot inputs and environmental conditions. In this accident, the helicopter's performance was not a contributing factor, as it had sufficient power to approach, hover, and land at the altitude of the landing site (4.5.2). However, the pilot's handling of the aircraft during the approach and go-around was critical. The pilot's misjudgment of the wind led to a loss of translational lift without a compensatory increase in power, resulting in the helicopter sinking and striking the ground (4.3.8). The report also notes that "The helicopter responded correctly to flight control inputs and to the demanded power increase" (4.5.7), indicating that the handling of the helicopter during the go-around was a significant aspect of the accident.
- name: Pilot Decision Making and Training
  explanation: Pilot decision making and training is a safety theme that involves the choices made by pilots based on their training, experience, and situational awareness. In this case, the pilot's decision to not fly a reconnaissance pattern prior to the approach, due to familiarity with the landing site, and the subsequent misjudgment of the wind direction were key factors in the accident (4.3.6, 4.6.1). The report highlights the importance of careful flight planning and vigilance when approaching unprepared landing sites in mountainous terrain (4.6.1). Additionally, the operator arranged additional human factors training for pilots following the accident, covering topics such as decision-making and situational awareness (4.6.2), indicating the relevance of this theme to the accident.
- name: Emergency Response and Equipment
  explanation: Emergency response and equipment is a safety theme that includes the effectiveness of emergency procedures and the reliability of emergency equipment. In this accident, the helicopter's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) failed to alert the search and rescue network promptly due to antenna disconnection during the crash (4.8.5). This had the potential to delay search and rescue operations, adversely affecting survivability (5.8). The report also notes the importance of pilots advising their flight-following services of any changes to their flight plans to ensure an effective emergency response (4.8.9).
- name: Organizational Safety Management
  explanation: Organizational safety management is a safety theme that involves the policies, procedures, and culture of an aviation operator that contribute to overall safety. The operator in this accident had experienced four serious landing accidents in three years, prompting a recommendation for a review of the operator's safety management system (4.7.8). The report also mentions that the operator had made changes to organizational systems and policy as a result of previous accidents (4.7.3). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the finding that "the operator had had four significant landing accidents in three years, for which the factors were not determined conclusively" (5.7).
- name: Approach and Landing Techniques
  explanation: Approach and landing techniques are a safety theme that includes the methods and procedures used by pilots during the critical phases of flight leading up to landing. In this accident, the pilot's approach was at a relatively high speed, low, and close to the landing site, which did not allow time to confirm the wind direction and resulted in a tight turn to a short final approach (5.3). The report states that "a longer, descending final approach, offset from rather than perpendicular to the ridgeline, would have been preferable" (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the pilot did not conform with the operator's stated principle of conducting constant attitude approaches (5.6), and the approach technique used negated the intended escape route, preventing a successful go-around (5.5).
