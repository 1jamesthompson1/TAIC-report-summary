The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviat ion and rail accidents 
and incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not 
to ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil 
or regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Monday  12 September  2016, the weather  in the Queenstown area  was fine and clear 
with a moderate westerly wind .  The Helicopter Line was using several AS350 -B2 (Squirrel) 
helicopters for tourist flights  in the area.  
1.2. One of the flight s was to take  five passengers for a snow -landing experience on Mount 
Vanguard, north of Queenstown.  Soon after take -off the pilot saw th at th e weather had 
deteriorated in that direction , so he changed the destination to Mount Sale, northeast of 
Arrowtown.  
1.3. The pilot approach ed the intended landing site , at an eleva tion of approximately 1 ,500 
metres,  from the north .  He said that t he approach proceeded normally until the final stage , 
when the rate of descent suddenly increased , so he  increased the  power  to go around .  
Although the helicopter responded  to the pilot's  control inputs , it struck the ground hard 
with the landing gear and the main rotor blades , and came to rest on its left side.  
1.4. One of the passengers suffered a minor injury to his knee .  The helicopter was substantial ly 
damaged . 
1.5. The Transport Accident Inve stigation Commission (Commission) found  that the helicopter 
weight and balance were within limits, the engine was delivering high power and the 
helicopter was operating normally.  The pilot had the required training and experience for 
the flight.   
1.6. The Commission found  that the landing approach was made with a tailwind when the pilot 
was expect ing a crosswind .  The pilot made a relatively fast, low and close approach  to the 
landing site .  This technique might not give pilots enough  time to confirm the actual wind 
before landing, nor does it en sure that t heir intended escape route s remain useable 
throughout the approach.   
1.7. The Commission identified a safety  issue  in that t he operator had had four serious landing 
accidents  in three years.  While there were some similarities in the circumstances , the 
factors for most of these accidents were not determined conclusively by the Commission's 
inquiries or by the operator's internal investigations .   
1.8. Therefore the Commission made a recommendation  that the chief exe cutive of The 
Helicopter Line, in consultation with the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority, review The 
Helicopter Line's safety management  system audit process to ensure that its  safety policy, 
safety assurance, risk manage ment, and promotion of safety a re sound.  
1.9. Key lessons  arising from this inquiry were:  
 human factors can have both positive and negative effect s on situational awareness. It 
is important for pilots to remain vigilant for changes in environmental conditions . 
 the loss of the emergency locat or transmitter  antenna during the break -up sequence  
demonstrated once again that an alternative means of independent, real -time flight 
following would be beneficial in respect of search and rescue3. It is prudent to use a 
flight -following service or facili ty where possible .  
 
 
                                                        
3 The unreliability of emergency locat or transmitter s is well documented; see Commission report AO -2011 -
003 with associated s afety recommendation 006/14.

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On the afternoon of Monday  12 September  2016, the Police  notified the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission (Commission) of the accident.  The Commission opened an inquiry 
under section 13(1) (b) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and 
appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 1 3 September  2016 the Commission notified the Bureau d'Enquetês et d'Analyses (BEA) 
of France, the State of Manufacture for the helicopter and the engi ne.  In accordance with 
Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, France appointed a BEA 
investigator as its Accredited Representative to participate in the investigation.  
2.3. Three investigators from the Commission arrived in Queenstown on the afternoon of 1 3 
September  2016 and conducted interviews with some of the passengers  who were about to 
leave the area .  The investigators carried out  a site and wreckage examination on 1 4 
September 2016 .  The wreckage was removed late r that day and taken to a secure location . 
2.4. In the following two days  interviews were conducted with the pilot , the remaining 
passengers  and the first responders  to the accident .  Photographs and video recordings 
taken prior to and after the accident w ere obtained.  
2.5. The m aintenance records for the helicopter were obtained and the engine was given  an 
initial technical inspection by the Safron/Turbomeca field representative  in New Zealand . 
2.6. Between 8 November and 11 November 2016 the investigation team interviewed senior 
mana gers and other staff of the operator.  
2.7. Airways New Zealand provided a ir traffic control surveillance data that showed  the track of 
the helicopter during the accident flight.  
2.8. On 15 December 2017  the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to 
interested persons for comment.  
2.9. On 21 February 2018 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On the afternoon of Monday  12 September  2016, five tourists arrived at The Helicopter 
Line's (the operator 's) Queenstown base for a local helicopter sightseeing flight that 
included a snow landing .  The pilot allocated to the flight read the weather briefing material 
before going to start the helicopter.  
3.1.2.  A staff member  conducted the safety briefing  for the passeng ers.  A safety poster written in 
Simplified Chinese was presented to the Mandarin -speaking passengers . Each passenger 
was weighed and their weight was recorded.  The staff member showed the passengers to 
the helicopter , seating  four of them in the rear seats and one in the dual front seat.  The 
staff member  checked that the passengers' seat belts were secure before closing the cabin 
door . 
3.1.3.  At 1437 t he pilot was cleared by Queenstown air traffic control to depart  to the north 
toward s Mount Vanguard , the intended destination .  Shortly after take -off the pilot could see 
that the weather toward s Mount Vanguard was "a bit messy ", so he change d the destination 
to M ount Sale to the northeast of Arrowtown  and advised Que enstown air traffic control  (see 
Figure 1).  En route  the pilot estimated that the wind was from the west to south west . 
3.1.4.  The pilot stated that after flying over  Arrowtown he could see indications of  a westerly wind. 
He flew at about 5 ,000 feet (ft)  towards  Mount Sale , intending to approach the landing  area , 
which was an area of flat ground at 1,546 m etres (m)  (5,070 ft) and 1.7 kilometres ( km) 
west of the summit , from the north . 
3.1.5.  The pilot stated that he made a "normal " approach to the ridgeline and landing area (see 
Figure 2).  There was no turbulence and he estimated there was a crosswind from the west 
at about 10 -15 knots (kts).  Some of the passengers said that they thought the helicopter 
was not going to land because  of the high (ground) speed as they got closer to the landing 
area.

Final approach flight path (source : Airways New Zealand surveillance data)  
3.1.6.  At a point that the pilot estimated was slightly less than 50 m  from , and 20 ft above , his 
intended landing  site, the helicopter experienced what he described as an "excessive sink".  
The pilot said that t he sink  occurred before he started to increase  the power  in order to 
reduce the rate of descent for the landing . 
3.1.7.  According to the pilot, he  decided to go around rather than land.  He immediately raised the 
collective lever4 and applied  right pedal and forward right cyclic input .  He stated that the 
helicopter responded correctly to his control inputs and he noticed at this time that th e 
indicated engine power5 was at the upper limit.  
3.1.8.  However, t he nose of the right  skid hit the ground at a speed estimated by the pilot to be 
about 20 kts .  This was followed by the helicopter bouncing and rolling onto its  left side. 
3.1.9.  The engine continued to drive  the main rotors while the helicopter was on its side , until the 
pilot used the fuel shut -off lever to shut  down  the engine .  This took about 30 seconds .  
3.1.10.  After the passengers had got out of  the helicopter the pilot found that the front seat 
passenger had suffered a deep laceration to his knee .  The pilot used his mobile phone to 
advise  the operator's Queenstown base  of the accident .

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 3.1.11.  The operator directed several of its helicopters to the crash site to give assistance .  All of the 
occupants of the helicopter were taken to Queenstown within an hour of the accident.  
3.1.12.  The accident occurred at about 1447 , in daylight . 
3.2. Site and wreckage examination  
3.2.1.  The accident occurred  on a north -facing slope west of the summit of Mount Sale, a peak 
1,700 m (5,576 f t) high, 5 km north east of Arrowtown .  The landing area was on a slightly 
sloping section of the ridgeline  (see Figure 3).  The operator used the landing area  often, but 
did not have a  dedicated wind marker  placed there .  At the time t here was a light covering of 
snow  on the tussock grass .  
  
Figure 3 
Mount Sale ridgeline and accident site  
3.2.2.  The right skid penetrated the snow and made contact with the ground while the helicopter 
was moving forward, at a point about 35 m to the north of the intended landing point .  
Shortly afterward s the main rotors str uck the ground , which cause d the helicopter to reverse 
direction . 
3.2.3.  The helicopter rolled left through 90 degrees  and came to rest on its left side , approximately 
20 m from the initial ground strike and 30 m from the intended landing point . 
3.2.4.  The fuselage structure remained largely intact , but the upper -forward cabin structure, 
windscreen and centre pillar were  struck by the main rotor blades and portions of these 
parts were  thrown some distance from the helicopter (see Figure 4).

Helicopter wreckage  
3.2.5.  All three main rotor blade s were destroyed and the arms of the Starflex main rotor head 
separated .  All three pitch change links failed during the break -up of the main rotor  (see 
Figure 5).  Pieces of the main rotor blades and main rotor head assembly were found  some 
distance from the helicopter.  
3.2.6.  The left and right aft lift struts  on the main rotor gearbox failed and the supporting airframe 
structure on the main rotor transmission deck was deformed.  
3.2.7.  Due to the 'bouncing' of the helicopter during the accident sequence , the underside of the 
engine casing contacted the tail rotor drive shaft shroud at its forward end.  The shroud, in 
turn, contacted the tail rotor drive shaft, leaving witness marks around its circumference.  
3.2.8.  The tail rotor blades and lower vertical stabil iser did not strike the ground during the impact 
sequence, although the tail boom deformed on its underside aft of the forward frame where 
it attached to the centre fuselage.      
3.2.9.  The collective lever was found in the fully raised position, which correspon ded with the 
pilot's report of demanding high power before the helicopter hit the ground.  
3.2.10.  The fuel tank did not rupture and its contents did not leak.  
3.2.11.  A close visual  inspection of the helicopter at the accident site confirmed the pre -accident 
integrity of the flight control linkages and cables between the pilot's controls and the main 
and tail rotors.

3.2.12.  An audible tone was heard  from the e mergency  locat or transmitter (ELT) at the accident site , 
indicating that the ELT had been triggered.  It was switched off at the remote switch on the  
pilot's instrument panel . 
3.2.13.  The items in the baggage locker were  weighed.  They included camera equipment, survival 
equipment and five small bags of ballast , weighing in total 44 kilograms ( kg).  
3.2.14.  The wreckage was taken  to a maintenance facility where it was further disassembled .  No 
pre-accident technical anomalies were found .

 Engine investigation  
3.2.15.  The engine was inspected  visually by the  engine manufacturer's technical agent in New 
Zealand .  A borescope  was used to examin e internal components.   The compressor and 
turbine stages were viewed  from the engine inlet and exhaust , and through the ignitor plug  
aperture .  No anomalies were found during th is inspection.   
3.3. Personnel information  
3.3.1.  The pilot had completed his helicopter training in New Zealand in  2007 and obtained his 
commercial pilot licence (helicopter)  that year .  He  had then commenced employment as a 
pilot in Auckland .  He had obtained a B -category instructor rating in 2010.  
3.3.2.  In December 2013 he  had joined the operator as a full -time line pilot6 at the Mount Cook 
base .  He had gained an internal Category 1 authorisation on 8 September 2014 , which 
enabled him to fly unsupervised as pilot in command7.  He  had transferred to  the 
Queenstown base in May 2015 and completed his Queenstown area familiarisation training 
in the following four months . 
3.3.3.  At the time of the accident  the pilot had flown  2,701 hours on helicopters, including 1,246 
hours on the AS350.   
3.3.4.  His most recent  annual operational competency assessment check flight had been  
conducted on 17 January 2016 , the day after he had passed the associated theory 
examination.   
3.3.5.  In addition to that check , the training manager had conducted training in  the following  
aspects :   
 approaches  
 vertical descent speeds and forward airspeeds  
 finishing approaches to a zero -speed landing and to a 6 ft hover  
 staying out of the height -velocity curve8 
 condition s conducive to encountering  vortex ring state9.  
3.3.6.  This additional training had been  properly recorded by the operator.  The training manager 
explained that the specific training had been  given  to two pilots , either of whom might have 
been a pilot who was  reported by other pilots  to have been flying slow and steep 
approaches .  According to the training manager , "The [accident] pilot did not exhibit any 
problem areas during this training session ".  
3.3.7.  The pilot's most recent  180-day competency check , which includ ed a mountain -flying 
refresher , had been  carried out on 23 August 2016.  
3.3.8.  The operator had  had no reports of any problems with the pilot's flying and he was seen by 
his mentors as an average and dependable pilot.  
3.3.9.  The pilot held a Class 1 medical certificate with no restrictions or endorsements.  It was 
valid until 17 April 2017 for single pilot air operations carrying passengers.  He said that on 
the day of the accident he was not fatigued or suffering any sickness .  He had had two

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 rostered days off and three  annual leave days during the preceding week, and had flown  1.7 
hours and 1.85 hours  respectively  in the two days before the accident .  He stated that he  
had had plenty of rest during those  days and had been sleeping well.  
3.3.10.  The operator's procedures  required that after an accident  pilots were to give blood and 
urine samples that were to be test ed for the presence of any performance -impairing 
substances.   This test was carried out and t he results were negative.    
3.4. Aircraft information  
3.4.1.  ZK-HYY was a Eurocopter  AS350 -B2 helicopter, serial number 3886, manufactured in 
November 2004 .  It had been  imported into New Zealand from the United States in April 
2014.     
3.4.2.  On 23 May 2014 the helicopter had been  issued with an airworthiness certificate in the 
Standard category and placed on the operator's Operations Specifications. At the time of the 
accident the helicopter had flown 3 ,855.3 hours.  
3.4.3.  The engine, serial number 19003,  had entered service in April 2005.  It had accrued a total 
of 3,334 hours.  
3.4.4.  The helicopter h ad seven seats, including the pilot 's seat.  The pilot was seated on the right 
side and on this flight one passenger was on the left s ide of the dual front passenger seat. 
The front seats had four -point harnesses , consisting of a lap belt and one inertia r eel for the 
two shoulder straps.  
3.4.5.  There were four rear seats situated side by side in the cabin.  Three -point harnesses were 
provided for each seat , with standard aircraft -style  buckle s with lifting latch es. 
3.4.6.  The helicopter had a maximum certified take -off weight of 2,250 kg.  At this weight the 
allowable centre of gravity range was 3.210 m to 3.425 m aft of datum10. 
3.4.7.  At take -off the helicopter weigh ed 2,075 kg and the centre of gravity was within the limits.  
3.5. Meteorological information  
3.5.1.  On the day of the accident a large anticyclone covered the Tasman Sea , with a ridge of high 
pressure extending over the South Island.   The area forecast predicted wind from the 
north west  at 10 kts, increasing to 2 0 kts at 5,000 f t.  The freezing level was forecast to be 
7,000 f t and the temperature at 5,000 f t to be plus two  degree s.  The forecast visib ility was 
30 km , reducing to 6,000 m in rain .  The main cloud was areas of broke n cumulus at 3 ,000 
ft with tops at 6 ,000 f t, mainl y in the west .  Rain was expected to develop from late morning.  
3.5.2.  The pilot said that during the flight he detected a tailwind  from the west to southwest and , 
closer to Mount Sale, he  saw the tussock blown by a westerly  wind .   
3.5.3.  A video taken by the pilot on the ridgeline close to the accident site soon after the accident 
captured indications of a moderate wind from a northerly direction.  He also stated that , 
while standing at the scene, he noticed that the wind was from the north.  
3.5.4.  Pilots who flew to the acci dent site in response to  the pilot's emergency call  said that the 
wind in the Queenstown basin was from the southwest , but at about Lake Hayes there was 
an apparent wind shift to the north .  These pilots stated that when they arrived at the 
accide nt site , approximately 30 minutes after the accident , there was a north easterly wind  
of 15 -20 kts.

 3.5.5.  At the time of the accident the Cardrona ski field mountain ridgeline weather station, 7 km 
to the north of the accident site, recorded a northerly wind at 15 km per hour  (8 kts) gusting 
to 28.5 km per hour  (15 kts).  This data showed the wind consistently from the north 
throughout the day.  
3.6. Organisational and management information  
3.6.1.  The operator had been  established in 1986 from the amalgamation of three separate 
companies. This had resulted in the operator becoming  one of the largest helico pter 
operators in New Zealand , with extensive alpine flying experience in the South Island.   
3.6.2.  The operator held a Part 119 air operator certificate , issued by the  Civil Aviation Authority  
(CAA), which allowed it to conduct  Part 135 domestic helicopter operations involving 
passenger transport and commercial work, including to remote areas.  
3.6.3.  Queenstown  was the main centre of operations.  Outlying stations were  Glentan ner in 
Aoraki/Mount  Cook National Park, Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier.  Pilot training and 
competency, and quality assurance requirements were managed from the Queenstown 
centre.  'Lead pilots ' were appointed for each station, with the outlying stati ons visited 
regularly by the operations manager  and the chief pilot.  
3.6.4.  A fleet of 24 AS350 helicopters  was available for use by the operator.  The AS350  helicopter  
was considered by the operator to be the most suitable for the types  of operation  it flew in 
the mountains.  
3.6.5.  The CAA carried out  a five -yearly re -certification audit of the operator prior to renewing  the 
Part 119 air operator certificate on 23 September  2013.  No adverse findings  were  
recorded .  Several positive comments had been  recorded in the audit report , including  that 
the organisation's "high levels of operational safety " were being maintained by senior staff , 
and some  had been made  on the quality of its internal procedures .  The CAA auditors  further 
commented that a review of the CAA database had found no significant safety issues or 
trends that would have indicat ed systemic problems.  The CAA had routinely audited 
elements of The Helicopter Line's operation , with no major concerns identified.   
3.6.6.  Since the re -certific ation  the operator had  had three helicopter accidents:  
 on 28 October 2013 a collision  had occurred between two of its helicopters  on a 
snowfield . One stationary helicopter on the ground had been  struck by a helicopter 
about to land .  The pilot of the airborne helicopter  had received serious injuries11   
 on 9 January 2014 a helicopter that was moving sideways when it touch ed down  on the 
Richardson Glacier  had rolled onto its side .  There had been  no injuries12   
 on 16 August 2014 a helicopter taking a  heli-ski group  to Mount Alta  had struck the 
terrain  and rolled 300 m down a slope13.  After this accident the operator had carried 
out an internal review  of the management, supervision and training structure.  This had 
resulted in a management reorganisation, including a new position  of training manager  
and change d responsibilities and personnel.  
3.6.7.  Records obtained by  the Commission  showed that the CAA  had conducted a further  risk 
assessment of the operator after the 9 January 2014  accident.   The assessment  had been  
complete d on 30 May 2014.  A supplementa ry entry had been  added after  the 1 6 August 
2014 accident on Mount Alta  that showed the CAA had assessed the operator as having a

factors14,15. 
3.7.2.  CAA Advisory Circular AC61 -5, Pilot Licences and Commercial Ratings - Commercial Pilot

aviation psychology section of the matrix included  elements such as  information processing, 
situational awareness, and judgement and decision -making.  Additionally,  Appendix VI - 
Helicopter Basic Mountain Flying Training Syllabus (Theory Component ) in the Advisory 
Circular outline d the objectives for the situational awareness training  and approaches to 
unprepared sites .  
3.7.3.  The operator's exposition contained the following in section  4.4 Training Program  [sic]:  
Scope - The organisation places an emphasis on recurrent training as an important 
part of its safety programme. Such training will be directed towards the maintenance 
of a high level of flight  safety and piloting competence through effective and 
professional programmes that recognize the importance of human factors, risk 
management and pilot judgment training in pursuit of a zero accident rate . 
3.7.4.  Questions related to human factors appeared in the  operator's annual Operational 
Competency Assessment written examination for pilots.  However, the operator had not 
undertaken any recent specific human factors training for its pilots .

accounted for 70% of incidents and accidents. Often considered synonymous with crew resource 
management , it is, however, much broader in both its knowledge base and scope,  gathering information 
about human abilities and limitations and applying it to tools, machines,  systems, tasks, jobs and 
environments (CAA 2016).

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The accident occurred on the pilot's fourth flight that day in the helicopter .  He was 
experienced in mountain flying, had been employed by the operator for four years, and was 
known as a capable and competent pilot.  He was appropriately qualified and authorised, in 
good health and well rested.  
4.1.2.  The intended landing site was at an elevation of 1,546 m and had been used by the pilot on 
many occasions .  The site was not considered challenging as it had clear approaches from 
all directions.   The weather conditions were suitable for the flight.   
4.1.3.  The following analysis explains the circumstances leading up to the accident, and why the  
go-around was unsuccessful.  Some important considerations for mountain flying are 
reinforced.   
4.2. What happened   
4.2.1.  Surveillance  data showed that the pilot was less than about  100 ft above the landing site 
when he commenced a right turn back to wards  the ridgeline.  The turn was tighten ed as the 
helicopter lined up for the final approach , which was flown perpendicular to the ridgeline 
and heading south.    
4.2.2.  The reported sink occurred in the late stage of the landing  approach .  The pilot immediately 
applied power and attempted to go around , but  although the helicopter responded correctly 
to his control inputs, he was unable to prevent it striking the ground.  
4.3. Why it happene d 
4.3.1.  The pilot made the final approach to the south, expecting a westerly crosswind.  His own  
observation  of the wind  immediately after the accident , the recollections of the res cue 
pilots , and the recorded data from the Cardrona ski field confirm ed that the wind was from 
the north.  Therefore it was very likely that t he landing approach was made downwind  and 
the final turn was tightened because the northerly wind was blowing the helicopter closer to 
the landing site .   
4.3.2.  It is usually preferable to la nd a helicopter into wind .  For a given airspeed, the ground 
speed is slower, translational lift16 is maintained for a lower ground speed, and the power 
requirement to terminate the approach is reduced.  Directional stability  is also enhanced by 
the 'weathe rvane' effect of the vertical stabiliser. Th ese factors help to reduce the workload 
for the pilot.  
4.3.3.  A pilot compensates for the reduction in translational lift  as a helicopter slows down by 
increasing the main rotor blade pitch , at least until the helicopter enters  ground effect17.  If 
the reduction in translational lift is not countered by a thrust increase,  the helicopter will 
descend or an existing descent rate will increase . 
4.3.4.  When a helicopter slows to wards  a hover after  a downwind approach, z ero airspeed occur s 
while the helicopter is still moving forward .  A landing downwind  may be acceptable and 
safe, provided its pilot is prepared for the  necessary  handling adjustments.  
                                                        
16 The improved rotor efficiency resulting  from directional flight.  For the main rotor, t his occurs at about 
16-24 kts.  
17 A helicopter is 'in ground effect' when the downwash from the main rotor  strikes the surface, stopping 
the downward wash and generating an increase in pressure, effectively a cushion of air that reduces the 
power required to maintain position . 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO -2016 -006 4.3.5.  A pilot reduces helicopter speed by moving the cyclic stick in the oppo site direction to the 
helicopter's travel.  When applied in forward flight , this action is called 'flar ing'.  By tilting  the 
main rotor disc away from the direction of travel , a component of total rotor thrust slow s the 
helicopter . 
4.3.6.  The pilot was familiar with the landing site and therefore did not fly a reconnaissance 
pattern prior to committing to an approach.  Approaching from the west, as he did, was 
preferable to approaching  from the east.  It allowed a lower cruise altitude for a given terrain 
clearance and, being seated on the right side, he had an unobstructed view during the turn 
to final approach.  
4.3.7.  However, the track was flown upwind of the landing site  (whether the wind had been  from 
the west or from the north) , which resulte d in the turn to the final approach heading having 
to be tight.  As the turn progressed, and with the wind  very likely from the north,  the 
helicopter  was blown closer to the landing site .  The ground speed would have been  higher 
than for an approach into wind, and the pilot would have had to reduc e speed much earlier 
than he had anticipated.  
4.3.8.  Being closer to the landing site, a marked flare and associated power reduction would have 
been required .  However, b eing downwind, t he airspeed would have reduced to below that 
for translational lift before the ground speed was brought under control.  It is very likely that 
the pilot did not observe the airspeed reduction, and that t he consequent loss of 
translational lift without a co mpensatory increase in power led to the sink.     
4.4. The unsuccessful go -around  
4.4.1.  The pilot responded quickly to the sink and attempted to go around by increasing the power 
and turning right, away from the higher terrain.  However, the helicopter was approaching  
over rising terrain and at a similar altitude to the landing site, as well as being too close for 
the pilot's corrective actions to be effective.  
4.4.2.  A longer , descending  final approach , offset from  rather than perpendicular to the ridgeline, 
would have been preferable to the fast, low and close approach that was flown.  The former  
gives a pilot more time to confirm the wind direction  and helicopter performance.  If a 
tailwind is recognised, speed and power corrections can be made earlier and smaller , and a 
go-around can be initiated from a safer height along the planned escape route.  
4.5. Other operational  factors  
Helicopter performance  
4.5.1.  The helicopter weight at take -off was estimated to have been 175 kg below the maximum 
allowable weight . The centre of gravity was within limits.  The pilot said he had  had no 
controllability issues . 
4.5.2.  Performance charts showed that the helicopter had more than enough power available to 
approach, hover and land at Mount Sale, and was capable of achieving an 'out -of-ground -
effect'18 hover at the altitude of the landing site.  Helicopter performance was not a factor in 
the accident . 
Engine performance  
4.5.3.  The pilot said that there was no power loss or engine performance problem .  Neither he nor 
the passengers reported seeing, or hearing, any warning that would have indicated low 
engine RPM (revolutions per minute) or low rotor RPM.  The damage to the main rotor 
blades and main rotor head was consistent with the rotor having had high energy when the 
blades struck the ground .  The main rotor continued to be driven by the engine when it came 
                                                        
18 A hover at such a height that the surface has no effect on the downwash.  
 
Final Report AO -2016 -006 
<< Page 15 >>
 to rest.   It is evident that the helicopter's engine was producing high power at the time of the 
accident.  
Vortex ring state  
4.5.4.  Despite the pilot demanding full power, a safe recovery was not achieved in the height 
available.  Therefore the investigation c onsider ed whether the helicopter might have 
entered vortex ring state.   
4.5.5.  Airbus has previously advised, during another Commissio n inquiry19, that an AS350 Squirrel 
needs to have a rate of descent in the order of 900 f t per minute and forward airspeed less 
than 20 kts to be within the vortex ring state  domain.  The final turn and approach were 
relatively shallow, implying a low rate of descent.  A harsh flare of, say, 30 degrees nose up 
performed at 20 kts could  have result ed in an upflow through the rotor of 1 ,000 ft per 
minute .  However, t hat is not the same as de scending in the rotor downwash at that rate, 
because the increase in rotor thrust generated by the flare must be countered by the pilot 
reducing the collective pitch, thereby reducing the induced downwash.   Without the power 
input, a vortex ring state will  not occur .  
4.5.6.  When a helicopter is established  in vortex ring state , an increase in power i ncreases the 
main rotor downwash energy and causes the helicopter to descend  more quickly .  If the 
helicopter had encountered vortex ring state , it would  very likely have struck the ground with 
much more  vertical  energy than was evident at the site . 
4.5.7.  The pilot had been trained to recogn ise the handling symptoms of vortex ring state and said 
that these  did not occur.   The helicopter responded correctly to flight control inputs and to 
the demanded power increase.  Therefore it was very unlikely that the helicopter had 
entered vortex ring state . 
4.6. Human factors  
4.6.1.  The investigation did not identify any mechanical defect or helicopter performance factor 
that contributed to the ac cident.  The outcome was a result of decision s made by the pilot.  
His mistake in assessing the wind direction  reflected a reality of flying in mountain ous 
terrain, where the wind direction and strength var y as much as the terrain.   Hence the need 
for pilots to plan their flights  carefully , be vigilant, and operate conservatively when 
approach ing unprepared landing site s. 
4.6.2.  A knowledge and demonstration of the human factors that support operations  in the 
mountains are part of the CAA -approved helicopter pilot training syllabi at all licence levels.  
Although the operator's pilots had the correct train ing and qualifi cations, the operator 
arranged  additional human factors training for them  following this accident .  Topics covered 
include d helicopter stabilised approaches, decision -making, vigilance and situational 
awareness.

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO -2016 -006 Findings  
1. The helicopter had no mechanical or controllability de fect, or performance 
limitation , that might have contributed to the accident . 
2. The final approach to land was very likely made downwind , whe reas the pilot 
was expecting a crosswind.  
3. The pilot flew the approach at a relatively high speed, low and close  to the 
landing site.  This technique resulted in a tight turn to a short  final approach, 
whic h did not allow him time to confirm the anticipated wind.  
4. The reported sink very likely occurred when the helicopter's airspeed 
decreased below that for translational lift, but while the ground speed was 
still unexpectedly  high. 
5. The low and c lose turn to the final approach , flown perpendicular to the 
ridgeline , negated the intended escape route and prevented a successful g o-
around . 
 
4.7. The operator  
Safety issue - The operator had had four serious landing accidents in three years.  While there were 
some simil arities in the circumstances , the factors  for most of these accidents were not determined 
conclusively by the Commission's inquiries or by the operator's internal investigations.  
4.7.1.  The investigation conducted a  general review of the operator's  training stand ards and 
associated record -keeping , reporting standards and organisational culture . This review 
included interviews with senior personnel.   
4.7.2.  The pilot said that line pilots were  not und er pressure to complete flights, and it was evident 
that the organisational culture reflected this.  
4.7.3.  Changes had been made to organisational systems and policy as a result of previous 
accidents .  Actions  were taken by the operator  to improv e operational standards as a result 
of its internal investigation into this  accident.  
4.7.4.  The additional training carried out for two pilots , either  of whom might have been a pilot 
seen  conducting slow , steep approaches , demonstrated that the operator had a system of 
internal incident reporting and took appropriate action in response to reports in order to 
improve  operational standards .  
4.7.5.  The operator stated that it required its pilots to make "constant attitude approaches " to 
landing sites.  Final approach checks included the rate of descent, airspeed vs ground 
speed comparison, having  a planned escape route, having a landing commitment point, and 
undertaking a power check.  Pilots' compliance with this requirement was checked during 
routine operational competency assessments . 
4.7.6.  Although each pilot was checked as being capable of conducting constant attitude 
approaches, the company exposition did not specify that requirement.  Th is accident , like 
other recent landing accidents of the operator, suggested that its pilots might not be 
completing the final approach checks as expected .  The inherent flexibility of helicopter 
operations, which generally allowed pilots considerable d iscretion over the conduct of their 
flights , needed to be constrained in the case of air transport operations .  
4.7.7.  In spite of the operator having had consecutive  satisfactory CAA audits and enjoying a good 
reputation within the aviation industry, it has now had four serious accidents in three years, 
including this accident.  Not all of the factors contributing to these accidents were able to be 
 
Final Report AO -2016 -006 
<< Page 17 >>
 determined conclusi vely by the Commission's inquiries or by the operator's internal 
investigations.  
4.7.8.  Therefore the Commission is recommending  that the chief executive of The Helicopter Line, 
in consultation with the CAA, review The Helicopter Line's safety management system a udit 
process to ensure  that its safety policy, safety assurance, risk management and the 
promotion of safety are sound.  
Finding s 
6. On the accident flight the pilot did not conform with the operator's stated 
principle of conducting constant attitude approach es. 
7. In spite of many consecutive satisfactory CAA audits and a generally high 
reputation, the operator had had four significant landing accidents in three 
years, f or which the factors  were not determined conclusively.  
 
4.8. Emergency response  
4.8.1.  The operator's flight -following system at the Queenstown base recorded  the departure of the 
helicopter  at 1437 , for the amended destination of Mount Sale .  The helicopter was the only 
one of the operator's helicopters away from base at the time of the accident.  
4.8.2.  Pilots were expected to call the base by radio when they land ed at their destination s.  The 
flight -following system would  initiate an alert if a destination call were  missed or if a 
helicopter were  overdue at the time of its expected return to the base.  
4.8.3.  At 1447, af ter the pilot had supervised the egress of the passengers from the wreckage, he 
called the base on his mobile phone.  This initiated the operator's emergency response plan.  
The first of the operator's helicopters arrived at Mount Sale  at 1515 . 
4.8.4.  The helicopter was fitted with a 406 -megahertz  ELT that was activated by the impact , as 
designed . However , the roof -mounted antenna had disconnected from its coaxial cable in 
the crash and separated from the helicopter.  
4.8.5.  At 2245 on 12 September 2016 , eight  hour s after the accident , the first of three ELT 
transmissions was detect ed by the global search and rescue satellite system .  Two more 
transmissions were detected the next day .  The delay s in receiving the intermittent 
detection s were  almost certainly due to the disconnection of  the antenna  during the crash . 
4.8.6.  Had the pilot (or a passenger) been unable to report the accident, the damaged ELT would 
have delayed  a search  until the operator 's emergency response plan was activated , 30 
minutes after the last c ontact .  The unsatisfactory crash performance of ELTs has been 
noted in many previous accident reports of the Commission and the CAA.  The International 
Civil Aviation Organi zation and the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States  have 
ongoing research aimed at improving the performance and reliability of ELTs .   
4.8.7.  The Commission is monitoring  this matter by way of  a Watchlist  item: 'Technologies to track 
and locate'20. 
4.8.8.  The helicopter was equipped with a GPS -based tracking system.  Ho wever, transmissions 
from th at system were only sent at take -off and landing, and the unit was not designed to 
survive a crash.

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 4.8.9.  The pilot's change of destination after his departure from Queenstown is a reminder of the 
importance of pilots advising their f light-following service s of any change to their flight plan s.  
This issue was a key lesson identified during a previous inquiry by the Commission21.   
Finding  
8. The failure of the emergency locator  transmitter  to alert the search and 
rescue network had the potential to adversely affect survivability .

operator had had four significant l anding accidents in three years, f or which the factors  were 
not determined conclusively.  
5.8. The failure of the emergency locator  transmit ter to alert the search and rescue network had 
the potential to adversely affect survivability .

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues 
identified by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the 
Commission issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues 
that would not normally result in the Commi ssion issuing a recommendation.  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 16 January 2017 The Helicopter Line  advised  that online human factors training had 
been recently undertaken for operational personnel .  Further training  was facilitated in early 
2017 by an external consultant , who develop ed and delivered  a program me tailored to the 
operation.   
Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
6.3. None identified .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. In a previous report on an accident involving this operator22, the Commission commented 
that New Zealand's helicopter accident rate is higher than that of other aviation sectors.  
There has been public criticism of how helicopters are operated in New Zealand, including a 
culture of operating outside the manufacturers' published and placarded 'never exceed' 
limitations.  Should this situation exist, there is a possibility that such a culture has become 
normalised.  The core safety issue would therefore lie within the wider helicopter sector, wi th 
flow-on effects to individual operators' safety systems.  
On 21 February 2018 , the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation 
include the safety issue of helicopter operational culture in the CAA's  current 'sector risk 
profile' review . (004/18)  
7.1.1.  On 2 March 2018 , Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The Director accepts the recommendation and notes that operational culture is 
already identified as a risk in the Small Aircraft (including helicopters) Sector Risk 
Profile work currently nearing completion. The timing, content and ownership of risk 
treatm ents is developed at the end of the process so cannot be advised at this time.  
7.2. In spite of the operator having had consecutive satisfactory CAA audits and enjoying a good 
reputation within the aviation industry, it has now had four serious accidents in thr ee years, 
including this accident.  Not all of the factors contributing to these accidents were able to be 
determined conclusively by the Commission's inquiries or by the operator's internal 
investigations.  
On 21 February 2018, the Commission recommended  that the Chief Executive of The 
Helicopter Line, in consultation with the CAA, review The Helicopter Line's safety 
management system audit process to ensure  that its safety policy, safety assurance, risk 
management and promotion of safety are sound . (005/18 ) 
7.2.1.  On 13 March 2018 , the chief executive of The Helicopter Line replied , in part : 
Regarding the recommendation to review THL's safety management system I confirm 
The Helicopter Line (THL) has opened discussion on this matter with CAA and is 
already implemen ting this review.  I will now provide an update on current changes 
and timelines to complete a range of improvements.  
THL and CAA have agreed that the 2018 THL re -entry audit and (likely) 2019 Safety 
Management Systems (SMS) certification will be the best opportunities to progress 
the reviews referred to.  This notwithstanding, THL has decided to implement some 
SMS elements in advance of its SMS certification.  
Sector Risk Profiling has identified safety culture as a factor to be addressed by CAA 
and the industry.  THL is fully engaged on this project and attended recent seminars 
on the project.  CAA has agreed to provide learnings and information to T HL resulting 
from this project.

 Final Report AO -2016 -006 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Human factors can have both positive and negative effect s on situational awareness.   It is 
important for pilots to remain vigilant for changes in environmental conditions .  
8.2. The loss of the ELT antenna during the break -up sequence  demonstrated once again that an 
alternative means of independent , real-time flight following would be beneficial in respect of 
search and rescue23. It is prudent to use a flight -following service or facility  where possible.  
                                                        
23 The unreliability of ELTs is well documented; see Commission report AO -2011 -003 with associated 
safety recommendation 006/14.
