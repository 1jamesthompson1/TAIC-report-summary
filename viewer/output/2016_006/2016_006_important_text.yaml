  \ on the pilot's fourth flight that day in the helicopter .  He was \nexperienced\
  \ in mountain flying, had been employed by the operator for four years, and was\
  \ \nknown as a capable and competent pilot.  He was appropriately qualified and\
  \ authorised, in \ngood health and well rested.  \n4.1.2.  The intended landing\
  \ site was at an elevation of 1,546 m and had been used by the pilot on \nmany occasions\
  \ .  The site was not considered challenging as it had clear approaches from \n\
  all directions.   The weather conditions were suitable for the flight.   \n4.1.3.\
  \  The following analysis explains the circumstances leading up to the accident,\
  \ and why the  \ngo-around was unsuccessful.  Some important considerations for\
  \ mountain flying are \nreinforced.   \n4.2. What happened   \n4.2.1.  Surveillance\
  \  data showed that the pilot was less than about  100 ft above the landing site\
  \ \nwhen he commenced a right turn back to wards  the ridgeline.  The turn was tighten\
  \ ed as the \nhelicopter lined up for the final approach , which was flown perpendicular\
  \ to the ridgeline \nand heading south.    \n4.2.2.  The reported sink occurred\
  \ in the late stage of the landing  approach .  The pilot immediately \napplied\
  \ power and attempted to go around , but  although the helicopter responded correctly\
  \ \nto his control inputs, he was unable to prevent it striking the ground.  \n\
  4.3. Why it happene d \n4.3.1.  The pilot made the final approach to the south,\
  \ expecting a westerly crosswind.  His own  \nobservation  of the wind  immediately\
  \ after the accident , the recollections of the res cue \npilots , and the recorded\
  \ data from the Cardrona ski field confirm ed that the wind was from \nthe north.\
  \  Therefore it was very likely that t he landing approach was made downwind  and\
  \ \nthe final turn was tightened because the northerly wind was blowing the helicopter\
  \ closer to \nthe landing site .   \n4.3.2.  It is usually preferable to la nd a\
  \ helicopter into wind .  For a given airspeed, the ground \nspeed is slower, translational\
  \ lift16 is maintained for a lower ground speed, and the power \nrequirement to\
  \ terminate the approach is reduced.  Directional stability  is also enhanced by\
  \ \nthe 'weathe rvane' effect of the vertical stabiliser. Th ese factors help to\
  \ reduce the workload \nfor the pilot.  \n4.3.3.  A pilot compensates for the reduction\
  \ in translational lift  as a helicopter slows down by \nincreasing the main rotor\
  \ blade pitch , at least until the helicopter enters  ground effect17.  If \nthe\
  \ reduction in translational lift is not countered by a thrust increase,  the helicopter\
  \ will \ndescend or an existing descent rate will increase . \n4.3.4.  When a helicopter\
  \ slows to wards  a hover after  a downwind approach, z ero airspeed occur s \n\
  while the helicopter is still moving forward .  A landing downwind  may be acceptable\
  \ and \nsafe, provided its pilot is prepared for the  necessary  handling adjustments.\
  \  \n                                                        \n16 The improved rotor\
  \ efficiency resulting  from directional flight.  For the main rotor, t his occurs\
  \ at about \n16-24 kts.  \n17 A helicopter is 'in ground effect' when the downwash\
  \ from the main rotor  strikes the surface, stopping \nthe downward wash and generating\
  \ an increase in pressure, effectively a cushion of air that reduces the \npower\
  \ required to maintain position . \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO -2016 -006\
  \ 4.3.5.  A pilot reduces helicopter speed by moving the cyclic stick in the oppo\
  \ site direction to the \nhelicopter's travel.  When applied in forward flight ,\
  \ this action is called 'flar ing'.  By tilting  the \nmain rotor disc away from\
  \ the direction of travel , a component of total rotor thrust slow s the \nhelicopter\
  \ . \n4.3.6.  The pilot was familiar with the landing site and therefore did not\
  \ fly a reconnaissance \npattern prior to committing to an approach.  Approaching\
  \ from the west, as he did, was \npreferable to approaching  from the east.  It\
  \ allowed a lower cruise altitude for a given terrain \nclearance and, being seated\
  \ on the right side, he had an unobstructed view during the turn \nto final approach.\
  \  \n4.3.7.  However, the track was flown upwind of the landing site  (whether the\
  \ wind had been  from \nthe west or from the north) , which resulte d in the turn\
  \ to the final approach heading having \nto be tight.  As the turn progressed, and\
  \ with the wind  very likely from the north,  the \nhelicopter  was blown closer\
  \ to the landing site .  The ground speed would have been  higher \nthan for an\
  \ approach into wind, and the pilot would have had to reduc e speed much earlier\
  \ \nthan he had anticipated.  \n4.3.8.  Being closer to the landing site, a marked\
  \ flare and associated power reduction would have \nbeen required .  However, b\
  \ eing downwind, t he airspeed would have reduced to below that \nfor translational\
  \ lift before the ground speed was brought under control.  It is very likely that\
  \ \nthe pilot did not observe the airspeed reduction, and that t he consequent loss\
  \ of \ntranslational lift without a co mpensatory increase in power led to the sink.\
  \     \n4.4. The unsuccessful go -around  \n4.4.1.  The pilot responded quickly\
  \ to the sink and attempted to go around by increasing the power \nand turning right,\
  \ away from the higher terrain.  However, the helicopter was approaching  \nover\
  \ rising terrain and at a similar altitude to the landing site, as well as being\
  \ too close for \nthe pilot's corrective actions to be effective.  \n4.4.2.  A longer\
  \ , descending  final approach , offset from  rather than perpendicular to the ridgeline,\
  \ \nwould have been preferable to the fast, low and close approach that was flown.\
  \  The former  \ngives a pilot more time to confirm the wind direction  and helicopter\
  \ performance.  If a \ntailwind is recognised, speed and power corrections can be\
  \ made earlier and smaller , and a \ngo-around can be initiated from a safer height\
  \ along the planned escape route.  \n4.5. Other operational  factors  \nHelicopter\
  \ performance  \n4.5.1.  The helicopter weight at take -off was estimated to have\
  \ been 175 kg below the maximum \nallowable weight . The centre of gravity was within\
  \ limits.  The pilot said he had  had no \ncontrollability issues . \n4.5.2.  Performance\
  \ charts showed that the helicopter had more than enough power available to \napproach,\
  \ hover and land at Mount Sale, and was capable of achieving an 'out -of-ground\
  \ -\neffect'18 hover at the altitude of the landing site.  Helicopter performance\
  \ was not a factor in \nthe accident . \nEngine performance  \n4.5.3.  The pilot\
  \ said that there was no power loss or engine performance problem .  Neither he\
  \ nor \nthe passengers reported seeing, or hearing, any warning that would have\
  \ indicated low \nengine RPM (revolutions per minute) or low rotor RPM.  The damage\
  \ to the main rotor \nblades and main rotor head was consistent with the rotor having\
  \ had high energy when the \nblades struck the ground .  The main rotor continued\
  \ to be driven by the engine when it came \n                                   \
  \                     \n18 A hover at such a height that the surface has no effect\
  \ on the downwash.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2016 -006 \n<< Page 15 >>\n to rest. \
  \  It is evident that the helicopter's engine was producing high power at the time\
  \ of the \naccident.  \nVortex ring state  \n4.5.4.  Despite the pilot demanding\
  \ full power, a safe recovery was not achieved in the height \navailable.  Therefore\
  \ the investigation c onsider ed whether the helicopter might have \nentered vortex\
  \ ring state.   \n4.5.5.  Airbus has previously advised, during another Commissio\
  \ n inquiry19, that an AS350 Squirrel \nneeds to have a rate of descent in the order\
  \ of 900 f t per minute and forward airspeed less \nthan 20 kts to be within the\
  \ vortex ring state  domain.  The final turn and approach were \nrelatively shallow,\
  \ implying a low rate of descent.  A harsh flare of, say, 30 degrees nose up \n\
  performed at 20 kts could  have result ed in an upflow through the rotor of 1 ,000\
  \ ft per \nminute .  However, t hat is not the same as de scending in the rotor\
  \ downwash at that rate, \nbecause the increase in rotor thrust generated by the\
  \ flare must be countered by the pilot \nreducing the collective pitch, thereby\
  \ reducing the induced downwash.   Without the power \ninput, a vortex ring state\
  \ will  not occur .  \n4.5.6.  When a helicopter is established  in vortex ring\
  \ state , an increase in power i ncreases the \nmain rotor downwash energy and causes\
  \ the helicopter to descend  more quickly .  If the \nhelicopter had encountered\
  \ vortex ring state , it would  very likely have struck the ground with \nmuch more\
  \  vertical  energy than was evident at the site . \n4.5.7.  The pilot had been\
  \ trained to recogn ise the handling symptoms of vortex ring state and said \nthat\
  \ these  did not occur.   The helicopter responded correctly to flight control inputs\
  \ and to \nthe demanded power increase.  Therefore it was very unlikely that the\
  \ helicopter had \nentered vortex ring state . \n4.6. Human factors  \n4.6.1.  The\
  \ investigation did not identify any mechanical defect or helicopter performance\
  \ factor \nthat contributed to the ac cident.  The outcome was a result of decision\
  \ s made by the pilot.  \nHis mistake in assessing the wind direction  reflected\
  \ a reality of flying in mountain ous \nterrain, where the wind direction and strength\
  \ var y as much as the terrain.   Hence the need \nfor pilots to plan their flights\
  \  carefully , be vigilant, and operate conservatively when \napproach ing unprepared\
  \ landing site s. \n4.6.2.  A knowledge and demonstration of the human factors that\
  \ support operations  in the \nmountains are part of the CAA -approved helicopter\
  \ pilot training syllabi at all licence levels.  \nAlthough the operator's pilots\
  \ had the correct train ing and qualifi cations, the operator \narranged  additional\
  \ human factors training for them  following this accident .  Topics covered \n\
  include d helicopter stabilised approaches, decision -making, vigilance and situational\
  \ \nawareness.   \n                                                        \n19\
  \ Commission inquiry AO -2014 -005, Eurocopter AS350 -B2 helicopter (ZK -HYO) collision\
  \ with terrain during \nheli ski ing flight Mount Alta, near Mount Aspiring National\
  \ Park 16 August 2014 . \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2016 -006 Findings\
  \  \n1. The helicopter had no mechanical or controllability de fect, or performance\
  \ \nlimitation , that might have contributed to the accident . \n2. The final approach\
  \ to land was very likely made downwind , whe reas the pilot \nwas expecting a crosswind.\
  \  \n3. The pilot flew the approach at a relatively high speed, low and close  to\
  \ the \nlanding site.  This technique resulted in a tight turn to a short  final\
  \ approach, \nwhic h did not allow him time to confirm the anticipated wind.  \n\
  4. The reported sink very likely occurred when the helicopter's airspeed \ndecreased\
  \ below that for translational lift, but while the ground speed was \nstill unexpectedly\
  \  high. \n5. The low and c lose turn to the final approach , flown perpendicular\
  \ to the \nridgeline , negated the intended escape route and prevented a successful\
  \ g o-\naround . \n \n4.7. The operator  \nSafety issue - The operator had had four\
  \ serious landing accidents in three years.  While there were \nsome simil arities\
  \ in the circumstances , the factors  for most of these accidents were not determined\
  \ \nconclusively by the Commission's inquiries or by the operator's internal investigations.\
  \  \n4.7.1.  The investigation conducted a  general review of the operator's  training\
  \ stand ards and \nassociated record -keeping , reporting standards and organisational\
  \ culture . This review \nincluded interviews with senior personnel.   \n4.7.2.\
  \  The pilot said that line pilots were  not und er pressure to complete flights,\
  \ and it was evident \nthat the organisational culture reflected this.  \n4.7.3.\
  \  Changes had been made to organisational systems and policy as a result of previous\
  \ \naccidents .  Actions  were taken by the operator  to improv e operational standards\
  \ as a result \nof its internal investigation into this  accident.  \n4.7.4.  The\
  \ additional training carried out for two pilots , either  of whom might have been\
  \ a pilot \nseen  conducting slow , steep approaches , demonstrated that the operator\
  \ had a system of \ninternal incident reporting and took appropriate action in response\
  \ to reports in order to \nimprove  operational standards .  \n4.7.5.  The operator\
  \ stated that it required its pilots to make \"constant attitude approaches \" to\
  \ \nlanding sites.  Final approach checks included the rate of descent, airspeed\
  \ vs ground \nspeed comparison, having  a planned escape route, having a landing\
  \ commitment point, and \nundertaking a power check.  Pilots' compliance with this\
  \ requirement was checked during \nroutine operational competency assessments .\
  \ \n4.7.6.  Although each pilot was checked as being capable of conducting constant\
  \ attitude \napproaches, the company exposition did not specify that requirement.\
  \  Th is accident , like \nother recent landing accidents of the operator, suggested\
  \ that its pilots might not be \ncompleting the final approach checks as expected\
  \ .  The inherent flexibility of helicopter \noperations, which generally allowed\
  \ pilots considerable d iscretion over the conduct of their \nflights , needed to\
  \ be constrained in the case of air transport operations .  \n4.7.7.  In spite of\
  \ the operator having had consecutive  satisfactory CAA audits and enjoying a good\
  \ \nreputation within the aviation industry, it has now had four serious accidents\
  \ in three years, \nincluding this accident.  Not all of the factors contributing\
  \ to these accidents were able to be \n \nFinal Report AO -2016 -006 \n<< Page 17\
  \ >>\n determined conclusi vely by the Commission's inquiries or by the operator's\
  \ internal \ninvestigations.  \n4.7.8.  Therefore the Commission is recommending\
  \  that the chief executive of The Helicopter Line, \nin consultation with the CAA,\
  \ review The Helicopter Line's safety management system a udit \nprocess to ensure\
  \  that its safety policy, safety assurance, risk management and the \npromotion\
  \ of safety are sound.  \nFinding s \n6. On the accident flight the pilot did not\
  \ conform with the operator's stated \nprinciple of conducting constant attitude\
  \ approach es. \n7. In spite of many consecutive satisfactory CAA audits and a generally\
  \ high \nreputation, the operator had had four significant landing accidents in\
  \ three \nyears, f or which the factors  were not determined conclusively.  \n \n\
  4.8. Emergency response  \n4.8.1.  The operator's flight -following system at the\
  \ Queenstown base recorded  the departure of the \nhelicopter  at 1437 , for the\
  \ amended destination of Mount Sale .  The helicopter was the only \none of the\
  \ operator's helicopters away from base at the time of the accident.  \n4.8.2. \
  \ Pilots were expected to call the base by radio when they land ed at their destination\
  \ s.  The \nflight -following system would  initiate an alert if a destination call\
  \ were  missed or if a \nhelicopter were  overdue at the time of its expected return\
  \ to the base.  \n4.8.3.  At 1447, af ter the pilot had supervised the egress of\
  \ the passengers from the wreckage, he \ncalled the base on his mobile phone.  This\
  \ initiated the operator's emergency response plan.  \nThe first of the operator's\
  \ helicopters arrived at Mount Sale  at 1515 . \n4.8.4.  The helicopter was fitted\
  \ with a 406 -megahertz  ELT that was activated by the impact , as \ndesigned .\
  \ However , the roof -mounted antenna had disconnected from its coaxial cable in\
  \ \nthe crash and separated from the helicopter.  \n4.8.5.  At 2245 on 12 September\
  \ 2016 , eight  hour s after the accident , the first of three ELT \ntransmissions\
  \ was detect ed by the global search and rescue satellite system .  Two more \n\
  transmissions were detected the next day .  The delay s in receiving the intermittent\
  \ \ndetection s were  almost certainly due to the disconnection of  the antenna\
  \  during the crash . \n4.8.6.  Had the pilot (or a passenger) been unable to report\
  \ the accident, the damaged ELT would \nhave delayed  a search  until the operator\
  \ 's emergency response plan was activated , 30 \nminutes after the last c ontact\
  \ .  The unsatisfactory crash performance of ELTs has been \nnoted in many previous\
  \ accident reports of the Commission and the CAA.  The International \nCivil Aviation\
  \ Organi zation and the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States  have\
  \ \nongoing research aimed at improving the performance and reliability of ELTs\
  \ .   \n4.8.7.  The Commission is monitoring  this matter by way of  a Watchlist\
  \  item: 'Technologies to track \nand locate'20. \n4.8.8.  The helicopter was equipped\
  \ with a GPS -based tracking system.  Ho wever, transmissions \nfrom th at system\
  \ were only sent at take -off and landing, and the unit was not designed to \nsurvive\
  \ a crash.  \n                                                        \n20 https://taic.org.nz/watchlist/technologies\
  \ -track -and-locate   \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO -2016 -006 4.8.9.  The\
  \ pilot's change of destination after his departure from Queenstown is a reminder\
  \ of the \nimportance of pilots advising their f light-following service s of any\
  \ change to their flight plan s.  \nThis issue was a key lesson identified during\
  \ a previous inquiry by the Commission21.   \nFinding  \n8. The failure of the emergency\
  \ locator  transmitter  to alert the search and \nrescue network had the potential\
  \ to adversely affect survivability . \n  \n                                   \
