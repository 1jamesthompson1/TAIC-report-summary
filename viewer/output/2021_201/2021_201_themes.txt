Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Mechanical failure of a fuse: The report identifies the mechanical failure of a 20 ampere fuse as the single cause of the engine stopping and the loss of control of the jet boat. The failure was likely caused by a load being imparted onto the leg of the fuse by unsupported wiring, which resonated with engine vibrations.

2. Regulatory requirements: The report highlights that the regulatory requirements for commercial jet boat operations do not fully mitigate the inherent risk of a single point failure of the propulsion and control systems. There is a need for operators to improve passenger safety by conducting thorough technical assessments and identifying potential single point failures and necessary mitigation measures.

3. Driver incapacitation: The report mentions the driver becoming incapacitated and the need for a foolproof system of contacting rescue services in such situations. The installation of an emergency button on all jet boats for passengers to use in case of driver incapacitation is mentioned as a safety measure implemented by the company.

4. Passenger safety: The report emphasizes the importance of improving passenger safety by proactively conducting thorough technical assessments and identifying potential single point failures critical to the safe operation of individual vessels. It also mentions the need to discuss possible measures to reduce the risk of single point failure to as low as reasonably practicable.

5. Single point of failure: The report highlights the vulnerability of jet boats to single point failures and the need to identify and mitigate single points of failure for a jet boat's control system. It suggests that resolving the safety issue associated with the fuse arrangement does not address the wider systemic issue of identifying single point failures on critical control systems.

6. Consequences of failure: The report mentions that the consequences for passenger safety would be the same whether the fuse failed due to mechanical failure or electrical overload. It emphasizes the need to address potential points of failure that could lead to an immediate and total loss of control of the jet boat.
