- While ATC sequence an IFR aeroplane to land and approves the flight crew to conduct a visual approach, current air traffic rules do not require controllers to provide flight crew with their positions in the approach sequence. This information can be crucial to a flight crew conducting a visual approach for them to maintain their situational awareness.
- When an IFR aeroplane is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current ATC procedures can allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency dependent on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation where the approach controller is unable to contact that flight crew when the controller is still responsible for monitoring that flight crew's compliance with an instruction.
- Potentially critical information on a serious incident, recorded in two separate CVRs, was lost because the recordings were not protected.
