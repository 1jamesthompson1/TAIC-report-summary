- name: Visual Identification and Confirmation Bias
  explanation: Visual identification is a critical aspect of maintaining separation during visual approaches. In this incident, the flight crew of LINK285 misidentified an A320 as the aircraft they were supposed to follow, which was actually a Dash-8. This misidentification was influenced by confirmation bias, where the crew looked for information that supported their preconceptions and ignored conflicting data. "The flight crew in LINK285 looked ahead for LINK235 where they expected it to be and saw an aeroplane. They agreed it was LINK235 but they had likely experienced confirmation bias" (3.36). This theme is relevant because it highlights the human factors and perceptual challenges that can lead to serious incidents, emphasizing the need for robust verification processes and cross-checking of visual identifications.
- name: Situational Awareness in Visual Approaches
  explanation: Situational awareness is crucial for pilots conducting visual approaches under IFR conditions. The flight crew's ability to maintain awareness of their position in the landing sequence is essential for safe operations. In this case, the flight crew lacked complete situational awareness of the aircraft sequence, which contributed to the incident. "The flight crew of LINK285 had not developed a complete mental image of other aircraft relative to their own position in the landing pattern before they took over responsibility for maintaining their visual separation from the aeroplane they had identified ahead" (4.4). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of situational awareness and the potential consequences when it is compromised.
- name: Communication and Radio Frequency Management
  explanation: Effective communication and proper radio frequency management are vital for air traffic control and flight crew coordination. In this incident, the approach controller was unable to establish immediate communication with LINK285 after they changed to the tower frequency, which delayed the resolution of the conflict. "By allowing a flight crew on a visual approach to change radio frequency at their discretion, based on other clearance actions, meant the approach controller was unable to establish immediate communication with an aircraft within their control sector" (4.8). This theme is relevant because it highlights the procedural gaps that can lead to a loss of communication at critical moments, increasing the risk of incidents.
- name: Use of Available Resources and Systems
  explanation: The use of available resources and systems, such as Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS), is a key safety theme. In this incident, the flight crew did not utilize the TCAS to validate their visual identification of the aircraft they were following. "Further resources, such as Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems and the air traffic control guidance available to the flight crew to help validate their mental models of their situation, were not used" (4.6). This theme is relevant as it points to the importance of using all available systems and resources to ensure safety and prevent reliance solely on visual identification, which can be fallible.
- name: Preservation of Evidence
  explanation: The preservation of evidence, particularly cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, is essential for post-incident investigations and learning. In this incident, the CVR recordings were not protected immediately after the incident, resulting in the loss of critical voice recordings. "After this serious incident, neither the flight crews from LINK235 and LINK285 nor the operator's ground crew isolated the cockpit voice recorders immediately after the incident flight" (4.9). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the procedural and regulatory requirements for preserving evidence and the consequences of failing to do so, which can hinder investigation efforts and the opportunity to learn from incidents.
- name: Air Traffic Control Procedures and Information Provision
  explanation: Air traffic control (ATC) procedures and the provision of information to flight crews are fundamental to maintaining safe operations. In this incident, the approach controller did not provide the flight crew with their position in the landing sequence, which is crucial information for maintaining situational awareness during a visual approach. "The current air traffic rules are inconsistent on the minimum information controllers are required to provide to pilots conducting a visual approach" (3.43). This theme is relevant as it identifies the need for consistent and comprehensive information provision by ATC to flight crews, particularly during visual approaches where the flight crew is responsible for maintaining separation.
