No repeat  accidents - ever!  
"The principal purpose of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) shall be to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding 
similar occurrences in the future, rather than to ascribe blame to any person."  
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
 
The Transport Accident Investigat ion Commission is an independent Crown entity and 
standing commission of inquiry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents that occur in New Zealand or involve New Zealand -registered aircraft or 
vessels.  
Our investigatio ns are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve safety. Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue c riminal, civil, or regulatory action.  
At the end of every inquiry, we share all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve safety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypo thesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The Commi ssion 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1. On 12 March 2019, three aeroplane s on scheduled passenger flights were sequenced 
to land on Runway 34 at  Wellington International Airport. The first aeroplane in the 
sequence, an Airbus A320, was approaching from the south -west. The other two 
aeroplanes, both Bombardier DHC -8-311s (Dash -8s), were joining from the north -east.  
1.2. When  the first Dash -8 aeroplane (callsign  LINK235) was parallel with  the runway,  the 
flight crew  requested approval for a visual approach, rather than a full instrument 
procedure . This was approved and the aeroplane continued downwind to position 
behind the A320.  
1.3. The second Dash -8 (callsign  LINK285) , following about two minutes behind  the first, 
also requested a visual approach . This was approved to follow the first Dash -8. 
However , the second Dash -8 identified the A320 as the Dash -8, then turned towards 
the runway  to position behind the A320 . This put it into a conflicting flight path with 
the first Dash -8. 
1.4. As the two Dash -8s approached each other, the air traffic controllers were alerted to a 
potential conflict by an automatic  short -term  conflict alert warning presented on their 
radar display s. The approach controller tried to resolve the conflict but could not 
contact the second Dash -8. They then contacted the Wel lington tower controller. The 
Wellington tower controller broadcast a message to resolve the conflict . At about the 
same time  the respective Dash -8 flight crews saw each other , and both took evasive 
action to ensure adequate separation was maintained . While taking this evasive action , 
the flight crews of both Dash -8s received automat ically generated , traffic -collis ion-
avoidance alert messages from their onboard systems  that advis ed them to take 
evasive action  to avoid conflict .  
1.5. Both Dash -8 flight crews avoided the potential conflict  and all three aeroplanes landed 
without further incident.  
Why it happened  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the crew 
of LINK285  mistakenly identified another aeroplane in the sequence to land for the 
preceding aeroplane they had been instructed to follow . The Commission found that 
the flight crew had insufficient situation al awareness  in relation to their position in the 
circuit pattern before they took  on the responsibility of maintaining their visual 
separation from the aeroplane ahead . The lighting and visual conditions prevailing at 
the time made it more difficult for the LINK285 flight crew to visua lly identif y the 
preceding aeroplane , and they had not use d other means they had available to validate  
their visual  interpretation . 
1.7. In addition, the Commission found  that the automatic and human defences  
incorporated into the air traffic control and aircraft systems  detected the potential 
conflict  and prevented the situation escalating . 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 2 >>
 1.8. The Commission found three safety issues . Two safety issues were related to the 
situation where a flight operating under instrument flight rules changed to make a 
visual approach to l and. The first of these was that c ritical information for a flight crew 
to conduct a visual approach was not required to be passed on to the flight crew . The  
second was that air traffic control procedures could create a situation where an 
approach controller would be  unable to contact a flight crew when the  controller was 
still responsible  for monitoring that flight crew's compliance with an instruction . A third 
safety issue was that, after a serious incident, the operator's current practice  allowed 
potentially critical evidence  contained in two separate aircraft cockpit voice recorder s 
to be lost . 
1.9. The Commission considered that the actions taken by the respective operators 
adequately addressed these  safety issues , so has not made any safety 
recommendation s.  
What we can learn  
1.10. The v isual identification of other aircraft can be challenging . Pilots should use  all 
available resources to build situation al awareness . 
1.11. When a controller issues a clearance, it is important  to monitor the flight crew's initial 
compliance to check it has been interpreted as intended . 
1.12. Traffic Collision Avoidance System  equipment is an effective  defence against mid-air 
collisions , and its display is also a useful instrument  that flight crew can use for their  
situational awareness.  
Who may benefit  
1.13. Commercial p ilots, air service operators , air traffic service  providers  and air traffic 
controllers  will benefit from this report.

 2 Factual information   
Pārongo pono  
Narrative  
2.1. On 12 March 2019  at 17321, three aeroplanes on scheduled passenger flights were 
sequenced to land on Runway 342 at Wellington International Airport. The first 
aeroplane in the sequence, was an Airbus A320 . Two Bomba rdier DHC-8-311 (Dash -8) 
aeroplanes  operated by Air Nelson  (the operator) were conducting a  visual approach3 
under instrument flight rules4 (IFR) to follow the Airbus . The rear aeroplane in the 
approach  sequence of three mistakenly turned base early ; this set its flight path  to 
conflict with the aeroplane  ahead .  
2.2. The air traffic controllers were alerted to the potential conflict but were unable to 
contact the rear aeroplane's flight crew . The onboard  Traffic Collision Avoidance 
System s5 (TCAS s) fitted to the Dash -8 aeroplanes detected the potential for a collision 
and issued TCAS Resolution Advisory6 (TCAS -RA) message s to the flight crew s to take 
evasive  action . A collision was avoided and both aeroplanes landed without further 
incident.  
2.3. Both  aeroplanes  were scheduled passenger flights operating under IFR  in Class C 
airspace .7  
The approach sequence   
2.4. The two Dash -8 aircraft  were following an IFR approach on a standard arrival route  
(STAR ) called DOGAD THREE ALFA  to Runway 34 ( see Appendix 1 ). The last phase of 
the STAR from  the TURAK waypoint was changed to a visual approach  with a standard 
right -hand joining  pattern . This continued the  downwind leg  from TURA K followed by 
a right turn onto the base leg then right again onto a final leg that would line up the 
aeroplane  for the runway centreline (see Figure 3). The circular marked points in Figure 
3 identify waypoints used by air traffic controllers to manage air traffic in the ir areas. In 
this incident a third aeroplan e was sequenced  ahead of the two Dash -8 aeroplanes . 
The approach controller had set the landing s equence for Runway 34  with an  Airbus 
 
1 Times are in New Zealand daylight time (co -ordinated universal time + 13 hours) and expressed in the 24 -hour 
format.  
2 Runways are identified by their magnetic alignment, rounded to the nearest 10° increment. Runway 34 is 
aligned about 340° magnetic.  
3 An approach to a runway at an airport conducted under  instrument flight rules , but where the pilot proceeds by 
visual ref erence with the ground and clear of clouds to the airport.   
4 Rules that allow a properly equipped aircraft to be flown under instrument meteorological conditions  
(conditions expressed in terms of visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for 
visual meteorological conditions ).  
5 A Traffic Collision Avoidance System is based on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder signals, and 
operates independently of ground -based equipment to provide advice to pilots on pote ntial conflicting aircraft 
that are equipped with SSR transponders .  
6 An indication given to flight crew recommending a manoeuvre intended to provide separation from all threats; 
or a manoeuvre restriction intended to maintain existing separation . 
7 Class  C airspace  is a type of controlled airspace . For more details see Civil Aviation R ule 71 .105.

A more detailed timeline is provided for reference in Appendix 2.  
JST290 (No.1)  
2.6. The first aeroplane  in the approach sequence was JST290 , an Airbus A320  scheduled 
flight  from Christchurch to Wellington. JST290 was cleared to approach via a different 
STAR from the south -west to land on Runway 34.  
2.7. At 1730: 45 JST290 was established on its final approach  and about  seven  nautical 
miles9 (nm) from the threshold of Runway 34 . It was on a northerly heading , 
descending through  an altitude of 2,275 fe et.10

 LINK235  (No.2)  
2.8. The second aeroplane  in the sequence was LINK235 , a Dash -8 scheduled flight  from 
Rotorua to Wellington.  LINK235 had been cleared to approach from the north -east via 
the DOGAD  THREE ALFA  STAR .  
2.9. LINK235 was following the STAR when the Wellington approach controller  advised that  
a visual approach11 was available. Once the flight crew of LINK235 were satisfied that 
visual conditions were suitable, the pilot flying12 requested a visual approach13 to 
Runway 34 . This would require the flight crew to maintain their own visual separation 
from the aircraft ahead. The controller  cleared LINK235 for a visual approach behind 
JST290, routing via the LYALL14 waypoint with the instruction to contact Wellington 
tower when turning  base. 
2.10. After passing  over the T URAK  waypoint , LINK235 turned onto  a southerly heading to 
extend downwind to sequence behind JST290. At 1730:45 LINK235 was approximately 
3.5 nm south of T URAK  at an altitude of 3 ,950 feet .

2.11. LINK235 then turned right onto the base leg to intercept the extended runway 
centreline , and changed the active radio frequency to contact  Wellington tower .  
LINK285  (No.3)  
2.12. The third aeroplane  in the approach sequence was LINK285 , a Dash -8 scheduled flight  
from Gisborne to Wellington.  LINK285 had also been cleared to approach from the

 north -east via the DOGAD THREE ALFA STAR.  At 1730:45 LINK285 was 4.3  nm north-
east of  TURAK , on a south -westerly heading at 6 ,800 feet.  
2.13. The approach controller gave LINK285 a standard descent clearance to continue along 
the STAR. That clearance was follow ed with a description of the traffic ahead : "… and 
the company Dash just turning onto base, ahead of you by about 6 miles ". The crew 
responded with , "Visual Dash ahead, LINK285 ." This was positive confirmation to the 
controller that the flight crew had seen and identified the relevant aeroplane ahead.  
2.14. The approach controller  offered  the option of a visual approach : "is available to follow. 
Advise? ". The flight crew of LINK285 then  requested a visual approach.  
2.15. The approach controller 's clearance for the visual approach required LINK285 to 
"extend downwind as required to follow the Dash -8 ahead then to route via LYALL ". 
After confirming  the readback was correct, the approach controller said, "When turning 
base leg, contact Wellington tower  on 118.8  [megahertz ]." The approach controller 
then attended to another aircraft on their screen that was approaching from the south -
west.  
2.16. LINK285 flew ov er the T URAK  waypoint at 1732:00 then commence d a right turn onto 
the base leg and chang ed radio frequency to contact the tower controller .  
Air traffic control short-term conflict alerts 
2.17. LINK285's right turn onto the base leg brought it into potential conflict with LINK235. 
The conflicting flight paths triggered short -term  conflict alert s (STCA s) at 1732.45 on 
the approach controller's and Wellington tower controller's screens , which drew their 
attention back to LINK285.  
2.18. Approach and tower  controller radar displays (see Figure 5) show outline s of the terrain 
overlaid with the controlled airspace boundari es. Aircraft within an approach 
controller's area of responsibility are displayed as moving targets , representing their 
actual position s. A data block was displayed for each target with relevant information 
related to that target  (such as  the flight call sign, altitude, speed, aircraft type, 
destination, flight plan and controller's notes ). A two -minute speed vector shows where 
the target will be in two minutes at the current speed  and heading .

Figure 5: Positions of aircraft at STCA 1732:45  
(Credit: Airways)  
2.19. An STCA (or 'CA' in Figure 5 ) is a software conflict alert system built into the air traffic 
control (ATC) system. The system constantly monitors aircraft  predicted trajector ies 
and raises a conflict  alert on a responsible controller 's display if any target vectors are 
convergent .15 
2.20. Five seconds after the STCA  (at 1732:50 ), LINK285 broadcast on the Wellington tower 
frequency that it was  "right base for 34, visual approach, visual Dash ahead" .  
2.21. The approach controller attempted to call LINK285 on the approach frequency at 
1732:51 , but the  flight crew  were not monitoring it at th at time. The approach 
controller then contacted the tower controller by phone , at 1732:55.  
2.22. The tower controller answere d the telephone call from the approach controller and did 
not respond to the radio call from LINK285.  
2.23. On the conclusion of the phone call between the controller s, the tower controller 
broadcast at 1733:07 to LINK285: "Essential traffic16 on your left is a Dash -8 on a nine -
mile final [approach] descending through 2 ,400 feet, maintain 3 ,000 feet."  
2.24. The flight crew of LINK285 did not respond on the radio to the 'essential traffic' 
warning from the tower controller , but commenced a left -hand t urn to the south  within  
10 seconds of that call.  
2.25. A subsequent attempt by the approach controller to contact LINK285 on the approach 
frequency  also went unanswered.  
TCAS Resolution Advisory  
2.26. At 1733:25, five seconds after commencing the left turn, LINK285's onboard TCAS 
issued an audible message (Resolution Advisory) to the flight crew to "climb climb ". At

Services (RAC)  6, section 23 .

 the same time the TCAS on  board LINK235 issued an audible message (Resolution 
Advisory) fo r that flight crew to "descend , descend ". The flight crew s of both LINK235 
and LINK285 took evasive action as directed by their TCAS s. 
2.27. LINK235 advised the tower controller of a TCAS -RA, which the tower controller 
acknowledged. LINK285 then acknowledged the  same by stating its call sign,  
"LINK285 ". 
2.28. Air traffic radar records showed  that the two aeroplanes came within 0.8 nm (1.5 km) of 
each other horizontally and 475 feet (145 m ) vertically.  
2.29. At 1733:44 LINK235  advised the tower  controller  that it was  clear of conflict . That was 
followed  immediately with a similar message from LINK285.  
2.30. The tower controller then instructed LINK285 to contact the approach controller on 
122.3 MHz and for LINK235 to continue on to land.   
2.31. 122.3 MHz was a published Wellingto n alternate  approach frequency  on the STAR . At 
the time it was being used by the departure controller17, who sat immediately adjacent 
to the approach controller at the Wellington control desk in Christchurch.  The 
departure controller was aware of the STCA  incident due to their proximity to the 
approach controller , and immediately assumed control of LINK285  without comment . 
The departure controller directed LINK285 to continue heading south , then 
repositioned it for a visual approach behind LINK235 . Once LINK285 was established 
on its final approach , it was passed back to the tower controller for a landing clearance.  
2.32. All aeroplanes  involved landed without further incident .

 Meteorological  information  
2.38. The Wellington aerodrome automatic terminal  information  service  (ATIS) broadcast  the 
conditions at the time as : 
• surface wind 340 ° magnetic  at 14  knots19 varying between 280 ° magnetic  and 360 ° 
magnetic  
• cloud broken (5/8ths - 7/8ths coverage) with the cloud base at 1 ,700 feet  
• visibility 20 kilometres  
• temperature 21 ° Celsius  
• dew point 16 ° Celsius  
local barometric pressure (QNH) 1 ,015 hectopascals .  
2.39. Sunset on 12 March 2019  was at 1947 . At 1730:45  the sun was  low in the west at  24° 
above the horizon.  
Aerodrome  and airspace  information  
2.40. Wellington International Airport is located on the south-east side of Wellington city 
(see Appendix 1).  The airport  has a single runway  aligned approximately north  to south 
named runway  34 or 16 respectively.  The terminal control zone extend s from the 
surface to 2,500 feet, and 10 nm to the south.  
2.41. The Wellington terminal area sits above the control zone  and provides  defined air 
corridors  to the control zone  from upper cruising levels . Both these sections of airspace 
are designated Class C. 
Lyall waypoint  
2.42. The LYALL waypoint was a GPS waypoint located six nm from the threshold of Runway 
34. It was a flyby point used to establish a standard route on a visual approach . It was 
once publishe d on a visual arrival chart,  but that chart has since been discontinued. It 
also existed as a designated waypoint but was not depicted on any approach charts.  
Controllers used it for domestic traffic.  
2.43. Air New Zealand advised that LYALL was not programmed i nto the Q300 or ATR72 
flight management systems. Flight crew must rely upon crew knowledge and 
experience  when ATC issued a clearance through LYALL and it required the crew to 
manually program the point rather than selecting a pre -set waypoint . The final f ix 
(point F134) for an instrument landing to Runway 34 was 0.2 nm away from LYALL and 
sometimes used instead.  
2.44. Airways reviewed the LYALL  waypoint after this incident and it has since been deleted 
from the Air Navigation Register.

 Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)  
2.45. The Collins TCAS -94, TCAS II identifi es and display s potential and predicted collision 
threats. The system protect s a volume of airspace around an aircraft by interrogating 
transponders20 in nearby aircraft  and provide appropriate aural and visual advisories to 
a flight crew when another aircraft is predict ed to infringe  on the protected airspace.   
2.46. TCAS s provide two advisory levels to flight crew. The first  advisor y level,  Traffic 
Advisory , displays  and annunciates the relative positions of intruding aircraft that are 
12 nm (approximately 40 seconds) from the closest point of approach. A Traffic 
 
20 Electronic device s that produce  response s when they receive  radio -frequency interrogation. Aircraft have 
transponders to assist in their identif ication  on air traffic control radar.  
Figure 6: Collins TCAS -94 Resolution Advisory Indication  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 12 >>
 Advisory  provides the flight crew with adequate time to visually locate the intruding 
aircraft and initiate evasive manoeuv res. The second advisory level , Resolution 
Advisory , displays  and annunciates  a vertical manoeuvre that increase s separation 
when the intruding aircraft is approximately 25 seconds from the closest point of 
approach. When in receipt of a TCAS -RA the flight  crew must initiate evasive 
manoeuvres based on the TCAS -RA unless compliance is unsafe.21 If both aircraft have 
TCAS s, the equipment  coordinate s avoidance advisories to maximise separation , for 
example  by instructing one aircraft to climb and the other to  descend.  
Visual approach under IFR  
2.47. Under an IFR approach procedure, the flight crew may request to fly all or part of the 
procedure  by maintaining their own visu al separation from other aircraft , rather than 
continue with the published procedure  where  the controller provid es the  separation . 
Approval is conditional , among other things, on certain meteorological  conditions 
existing. In this incident , changing to a visual approach meant that the last two 
waypoints , RONGO and UMAGA ( see Appendix 1) , could be excluded.  
2.48. Visual approach es while under IFR are available at  controlled aerodromes when 
meteorological conditions are suitable . The benefits can include  reduc ing controller 
and flight crew workload and reduc ing time and costs with a shorter flight path over 
the ground. One consequence of chang ing to a visual approach is the flight crew 
should  have a full appreciation of the ir position  in the sequenc e and take responsibility 
for their own separation  from aircraft  they have been instructed to follow .  
2.49. The air traffic rules for IFR flight are based on internationally agreed standards and 
recommended practices , which are then usually incorporated into local rules for each 
jurisdiction.  New Zealand aligns the Civil Aviation Rules for air traffic management with 
ICAO's standards and recommended practices prescribed in Annex 11 and 2 to the 
Convention. These Annexe s govern the application of the Procedures for Air 
Navigation Services - Air Traffic Management (Doc 4444) and the Regional 
Supplementary Procedures - Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services (Doc 7030), which 
are incorporated into Airways' Manual of Air Traffic Services . The International Civil 
Aviation Organi zation (ICAO) Document 4444, Procedures for Air Navigation Services , 
states that:  
6.5.3.1…  clearance for an IFR flight to execute a visual approach may be 
requested by a flight crew or initiated by t he controller. In the latter case, the 
concurrence of the flight crew shall be required.  
6.5.3.4 Separation shall be provided between an aircraft cleared to execute a 
visual approach and other arriving and departing aircraft.  
6.5.3.5 For successive visual approaches, separation shall be maintained by the 
controller until the pilot of a succeeding aircraft reports having the preceding 
aircraft in sight. The aircraft shall then be instructed to follow and maintain own 
separation from the preceding aircraft22 (ICAO, 2016) . 
2.50. ICAO Document 4444 is incorporated into the New Zealand publications to define 
airspace control in this country. Airways Corporation of New Zealand  (Airways)  
provide s a Manual of Air Traffic Services (MATS) for gu idance for its controllers. MATS

<< Page 13 >>
 state s that the controller is responsible for ensuring that "there is no possibility of 
incorrect identification"  when giving clearance to operate by visual separation.23 
2.51. MATS also state s that:  
when requiring a pilot to sight another aircraft prior to the application of visual 
separation, controllers shall provide such of the following information that is 
available and appropriate to the situation:  
• Aircraft type  
• Position of the other aircraft relative to a navigation aid or prominent 
geographic feature, a procedure or traffic circuit being flown, or a 
relative bearing (clock reference) and distance  
• Level information, relative height, or Mode C24 readout  
• Any other pertinent information such as direction of flight, company 
name, colour, intentions, etc. in circumstances where there might be a 
possibility of error in sighting the correct aircraft.  
Due to recognised difficulties in sighting another aircraft, such as size, colour, 
aspect, speed, sun position, background contrast , etc., controllers should not 
give sighting information until the aircraft are known or believed to be within 
10nm of one another.25 
ATC separation responsibilities  
2.52. Airways has standard operating pr ocedures26 for the control of aircraft movements in 
and out of Wellington and for the handover of control responsibility to each IFR 
aircraft as it crosses control boundaries.   
2.53. When IFR aircraft are sequenced to land at Wellington , the approach controller 
determines the sequence and is responsible  for separation between these aircraft until 
landing . An exception to thi s exists when an IFR aircraft has been cleared for a visual 
approach and has agreed to follow a preceding IFR aircraft, in which case the 
responsibility for separation is passed to the flight crew  of the following aircraft. 
Aircraft on a visual approach can be released from approach control to tower control 
by various means, allowing tower control to resolve conflicts with VFR traffic in the 
control zone.   
2.54. The tower controller takes responsibility for provid ing visual separation within 5 nm of 
the threshold , but only to ensure that the runway is clear and available for each aircraft 
sequenced to land.  The tower controller issues the sequenced aircraft  a clearance to 
land if the runway is clear .  
2.55. The flight crew on a visual approach  are responsib le for maintaining their separation 
from the aircraft they have been directed to follow , including for wake turbulence . They 
are also required under  right-of-way rules27 to maintain a visual lookout at all times to 
see and avoid other aircraft.

 2.56. In this incident, LINK285 was still within the approach controller 's area of responsibility 
to maintain IFR separation  between it and other aircraft  when the STCA and TCAS 
events occurred.  
Recorded data  
2.57. The flight data recorder (FDR) data records of both aeroplanes were downloaded 
under the  Transport Accident Investigation Commission's ( Commission 's) supervision.  
These records covered the entire incid ent flight s for both aeroplanes .  
2.58. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) system s fitted in both aeroplanes were  capable of 
recording two hours of crew communications in a continuous loop format.28 The 
previous recording was progressively overwritten by the next two -hour period. The 
CVRs in both aeroplanes were  not disabled until the end of the next leg . As a result  the 
incident flight record for LINK285 was lost and only the last 12 minutes of the incident 
flight for LINK235 were  available for analysis . 
2.59. Airways  provided recorded sur veillance data compiled from Secondary Surveillance 
Radar (SSR) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance -Broadcast (ADS -B) flight track ing 
data, audio recordings and images of the radar controller's display screens to the 
Commission for analysis.  
 
28 This was for the cockpit -area microphone and combined individual channels. The captain, first officer and 
public address channels were on a 30 -minute cycle.

 3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1. The main purpose of controlled airspace , air traffic control and IFR is to create safe 
pathways for air traffic  and to avoid potential collisions. Therefore, when two aircraft 
converg e too close ly in controlled airspace , causing the activation of aircraft or ATC-
based alerts, it is classified as a serious incident.  
3.2. This incident resulted in a STCA alert to the air traffic controllers followed by  a TCAS -
RA warning to the two flight crew s involved . The automated activation of these 
important  safety warning systems  is evidence that they worked correctly in the 
background and as intended  to prevent accidents.  
3.3. The potential  aircraft conflict was detected and avoided . The two aircraft subsequently 
landed without further incident and the passengers  were  very likely  unaware  of what 
had occurred .  
3.4. This analysis examines the circumstances and events leading up the TCAS activation 
and why the aeroplanes  were on conflicting flight paths within controlled airspac e. It 
looks at  the circumstances  and factors that increased the likelihood of the event 
occurring and those that were intended to preven t the incident . It also considers if any 
safety issues exist that could have the potential to adversely affect future operations.  
3.5. Three safety issue s were  identified :  
• the approach sequence position is critical information for pilots conducting visual 
approach es under IFR, but controllers are not required  to provide  that information i n 
a visual approach clearance  
• the association of radio handover to a tower controller with other clearance actions 
can result  in an approach controller losing  radio contact with IFR traffic in their sector  
• the operator did not preserve and protect potentially critical evidence contained in 
the CVRs immediately after this serious incident .29 
What happened  
3.6. LINK2 85 was following a STAR  to Runway  34 when the approach controller advised 
that a visual approach would be available.  The weather at the time was suitable for a 
visual approach into Wellington  and t he flight crew had visually identified an aeroplane 
ahead.  
3.7. The pilot flying  subsequently requested a vis ual approach. Once approved, the pilot set 
a course to follow the aeroplane  they had identified  ahead.  
3.8. The flight crew of LINK285 had mistakenly identified JST290 as the aeroplane ahead  
that they were to follow in the STAR procedure . They had not seen LIN K235 , which was 
also ahead and was the aeroplane they were meant to follow . The flight crew 
proceeded to position LINK285 with appropriate separation, behind JST290. They

Attachment C  (ICAO, 2016) .

<< Page 16 >>
 turned onto the base leg and changed frequency , then called Wellington tower in 
accor dance with their clearance.  
3.9. This movement took LINK285 onto a flight path that would conflict with LINK235's 
flight path , and it activated the STCA. The STCA drew the approach controller's 
attention back to LINK285, just as it was intended to do. As the f light crew had 
changed to the tower frequency, the approach controller could not make radio contact 
with LINK285.  
3.10. In the meantime, LINK235 was on its final approach  behind JST290. The flight crew 
were scanning their instruments and saw the other Dash -8 app ear on the TCAS display 
within their airspace and approaching  from their right -hand  side. They were planning 
to descend below glideslope30 to increase separation clearance.  
3.11. The crew of LINK285 reported to the Commission that they saw an unexpected aircraft 
on a conflicting flight path from their left and that they immediately commenced a left 
turn to avoid it. The flight recorder data confirmed that the aeroplane started a left 
turn approximately five seconds before the T CAS-RA activation.  
3.12. The left turn by LINK285 initially brought the two aircraft into more direct conflict , but 
as the turn progressed it took them further apart. The TCAS activated in both Dash -8s, 
and the respective flight crews took action as the systems directed to avoid the 
conflict.  
Responsibility for separation  of aircraft  
3.13. There are several safety barriers  to prevent regular passenger transport aircraft flying 
too close to other aircraft . Pilots and air traffic controllers  are responsible for managing  
the safety barriers that are applicable to their  operational areas. In this case t he first 
responsibility was with the approach controller. In Class C airspace, the controller is 
responsible for maintaining separation between IFR aircraft and between IFR aircraft 
and all other air traffic . This changed when the flight crew of LINK285 decided to  
accept responsibility for their separation from the aircraft ahead and conduct a visual 
approach. The approach controller 's responsibility was now to monitor that LINK285 
was complying with their instruction , so maintained a general awareness of LINK285's 
progress.  
3.14. Once t he flight crew of LINK285  were  cleared for the visual approach , they were 
primarily res ponsible for ensuring their own separation from the aeroplane  they had 
been instructed to follow . For this to work , they had to  identif y the correct aeroplane to 
follow. When the flight crew misidentified the aircraft ahead and followed the wrong 
aeroplane, the remaining safety bar riers came  into effect . 
3.15. The next safety barrier  to take effect was the automatic STCA . It was successful in 
detecting a potential conflict between LINK285 and LINK235 and in drawing the 
attention of both  the approach and the tower controllers to it in sufficient  time for the 
approach controller to act . However, t he approach controller was unable to contact 
LINK285 on the radio  because the flight crew were  in the process of transitioning from 
approach to tower frequency as instructed and were no longer monitoring the 
approach controller 's frequency.  This delayed  the approach controller in re-

<< Page 17 >>
 establishing contact and potentially issuing traffic information or instructions to resolve 
the conflict . 
3.16. The tower controller was also aware that the STCA had activated and was assessing  the 
situation .  When the STCA activated, LINK285 had not yet contacted the tower  
controller . Normal procedure for handover between controllers is that aircraft released 
to th e tower will have a suitable form of separation in place with no action required by 
the tower controller. The STCA created doubt for the two controllers about the 
sequence  and separation .  
3.17. The next safety barrier  to take effect was the tower controller advising LINK285 of 
'essential traffic'  in its vicinity . This call was initiated by the approach controller's 
telephone conversation with the tower controller. It was successful in further raising 
the LINK285 flight crew's awarenes s of the conflict . The tower controller 's message 
included guidance actions for the flight crew  to avoid the conflict .  
3.18. The next safety barrier  to take effect was the 'see and avoid' actions of the respective 
flight crew s. These were  also effective , as the  flight crews of LINK235 and LINK285 saw 
each other and initiated their own avoiding action slightly before their respective 
TCAS s had warned them of the potential conflict . 
3.19. The last safety barrier  to take effect was the TCAS . It work ed as designed and alerted 
both flight crews  to a potential mid-air collision and provid ed visual and aural 
instructions for them to avoid it.   
How did the flight crew of LINK285 mistakenly identify JST290 as 
LINK235 ? 
3.20. The flight crew of LINK285  mistakenly visually  ident ified an A320 on its final approach  
as a Dash -8 on the base leg.  This may seem improbable  given  that t he A320 is a low-
wing , twin-engine  jet aeroplane, while a Dash -8 is a high wing, T -tail, twin-engine 
turboprop aeroplane. The flight crew were experienced pilots attempting  to identify an 
aeroplane  that was  the same as the one they were flying  and operated by the same 
company . They were also familiar where aircraft would be on each leg of the approach 
pattern into Wellington Airport .  
3.21. This section discusses the possible factors that contribut ed to the flight crew of 
LINK285  misidentifying the aeroplane that the approach controller had instruct ed them 
to follow. It also outlines the rules in place for this situation and the defences in place 
intended to prevent one aeroplane  getting too close to another .  
Possible contributing factors that were excluded  
3.22. Several factors could have contributed to this incident , but t here was no evidence to 
support the following  items , so they were rejected.  
• Licensing: The LINK285 flight crew had the appropriate experience and licences to fly 
the aeroplane.  
• Workload: The weather was fine and the flight crew were not dealing with any sort of 
emergency situation or system failure. There were  only two other aircraft in the 
approach tr affic. The cockpit was reported by the flight crew to have been 'sterile' with 
no distractions. This situation would have been  unlikely  to present a high workload for 
experienced pilots.  
 
Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 18 >>
 • Fatigue: Both pilots in LINK285 had had adequate rest since their pre vious duty time 
and said they were alert and focused on the tasks at hand.  
• Familiarity: The flight crew stated they had briefed for the approach at the top of the 
descent and were both expecting a standard instrument terminal -arrival route through 
the way points to Runway 34. Although they had not briefed for a visual approach that 
could deviate from the IFR route, they had both  flown visual approaches to Wellington 
along this route  before . 
• Weather: The weather was fine  with scattered cloud  clearing from  the south of 
Wellington. The v isual clearance from cloud was assured and the horizontal visibility 
distance was suitable for visual flight conditions.  
• Pilot interactions: The captain and first officer both said they worked well as a team. 
Neither pilot expressed any concern about their working relationship in the cockpit.   
Situational awareness  
3.23. LINK285 was on a planned IFR descent profile31 under the control of the approach 
controller. The approach controller was , at that time, responsible for ensuring 
appropriate separation from other aircraft,  but the flight crew were  about to transition 
to a visual approach . 
3.24. The flight crew  needed to update their awareness  of other aircraft in the approach 
pattern  in preparation for conducting a visual approach . A pilot gains situational 
awareness by their perce ption and interpretation  of the information they receive 
through their senses. This includes  from visually scanning outside, scanning the flight 
instruments  and listening to radio chatter . Where an aircraft has two pilots, they share 
the workload and confer on their respective observations.  This helps them to build a 
shared picture  of other aircraft in the airspace around them.  
3.25. The flight crew of LINK285 said, during an interview, that they were listening to the 
Wellington approach frequency and heard instructions being issued to LINK235 and 
JST290. This indicate d that there were at least two preceding aircraft in the approach 
sequence  before they went  visual .  
3.26. According to  the ICAO proced ures for an IFR flight , to make a visual approach32 the 
pilot needs to positively identify aircraft they have been instructed to follow and the 
controller needs to monitor the pilot's actions. The guidance for controllers is stated in 
MATS33 as: 
After clea ring an aircraft for a visual approach and to follow another aircraft 
visually, radar controllers should continue to monitor the aircraft in order to 
confirm that the correct aircraft is being followed.  
3.27. At 1730:45, two minutes before the TCAS -RA, the radar  display for the Wellington 
approach showed LINK235 approximately 8  nm ahead and slightly to the left of  the 
track of LINK285, while JST290 was approximately 9  nm ahead and slightly to the right 
of the track of LINK285 (see Figure 7). 
3.28. The flight crew were required to identify the aeroplane ahead that was just turning 
onto base. JST290 was on  its final approach  at the time. The flight crew o f LINK285 and

  Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 19 >>
 the approach controller were  both confident that LINK235 had been correctly 
identified  as the aircraft ahead . The approach controller then switch ed their attention  
to another aircraft arriving at Wellington on the other side of their screen.  
 
Figure 7: Airways radar - positions of JST290, LINK235 and LINK285 at 1730:45  
  
3.29. While the relative positions of aircraft on the radar screen  were clear to the approach 
controller, the pilots in LINK285 did not have the same perspective .  
3.30. At 1730:45 , when the LINK285 flight crew stated they had LINK235 in sight ahead, the 
sun was approximately 24 ° above the horizon and to their right. The pilot flying  
recalled that conditions were suitable for a visual approach . There was s ome cloud  
around but the sun was low in the sky and it was clearer of cloud to the south. The 
pilot monitoring  had noted that co lour clarity was poor.  
3.31. At that time LINK235 was approximately 6 nm ahead, 2,800 feet below and flying 
directly away from LINK285 (see Figure 4). It would have presented as a small cross -
sectional area with little to no sun reflection and have had very little contrast or relative 
movement against the background. It would have been difficult for the flight crew of 
LINK285 to see and visually identify the other Dash -8. 
3.32. Conve rsely, JST290 was about the same distance away from LINK285 but lower down 
and slightly to its right -hand side and flying towards it. The sun would  likely  have been 
highlighting the upper surfaces of JST290 against the contrasting darker sea, making 
its re lative movement more obvious.  
3.33. At 6 nm a pilot would be challenged to distinguish an other  aircraft's details and colour 
scheme. The human eye could detect an object's movement and distinguish that it was 
an aircraft at that distance,  but the visual acuity of details may not be as clear.   
3.34. The image derived by a human eye may seem convincing and true to the eye's owner, 
but the human eye is well known to have imperfections and be subject to illusionary 
effects at times.

 3.35. In the book, Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine (Davis, Johnson, Stepanek, & 
Fogarty, 2008) , the visual function of the eye is described as:  
The visual apparatus, stimulated by light, must primarily perform three basic 
function s. It must be able to perceive an object by the detection of light emitted 
or reflected from it; this is known as light discrimination. Second, it must be able 
to perceive the details of an object; this is known as visual acuity. Third, it must 
allow one t o judge distances from objects and to perceive movement in the 
field of vision. These latter two functions combined are known as spatial 
discrimination.  
3.36. The flight crew in L INK285 looked ahead for LINK235 where they expected it to be and 
saw an aeroplane . They agreed it was LINK235  but they had likely  experienced 
confirmation bias.  
Confirmation Bias is the tendency to look for information that supports, rather 
than rejects, one's preconceptions, typically by interpreting evidence to confirm 
existing beliefs while rejecting or ignoring any conflicting data  (Noor, 2020) . 
3.37. Both the pilot flying  and pilot monitoring  LINK285 recalled in separate interviews that 
the pilot flying  had located the aircraft ahead (this was J ST290) and pointed it out to 
the pilot monitoring . The pilot flying  recalled that, initially , the pilot monitoring  had 
had difficulty identifying the aircraft ahead, but eventually they had both believed it 
was LINK235.  
3.38. The LINK285 flight crew had other information  available that conflicted with their 
agreed identification of LINK235  at this time, but they did not focus their attention on 
it. For example:  
• the LINK285 flight crew heard the approach controller pass the control of JST 290 to  
the tower  immediately before receiving their own clearance to descend. That meant 
they were one of three aircraft in the landing sequence.  They had identif ied one 
aeroplane in front, but where was the othe r? 
• the Dash -8 ahead was described by the approach controller as turning onto  base leg , 
but the A320 that they thought was LINK235  was on its final approach . This was a 
different position in the landing pattern,  and it was heading in a different direction  
from  LINK235  
• there is a significant difference between  the shape  of a Dash -8 and  that of  an A320.  
3.39. The TCAS  would have displayed information that also conflicted with  the crew's  mental 
model . The TCAS range was set to detect and display other aircraft with transponders 
in a 12 nm radius of airspace around the aeroplane. Both JST290 and LINK235 were 
about 6 nm away from LINK285 and their targets would have been visible  on the TCAS 
display as open or solid , cyan-coloured diamond s. The pilots in LINK285 said they did 
not check t heir TCAS display until after they saw an unexpected object to their left . 
They used the TCAS to confirm  it was an aircraft  target . 
3.40. The LINK285 flight crew's reliance on  the visual identification of the aeroplane they had 
been directed to follow , without considering  alternative sources of verification , led to 
their misidentif ying that aeroplane. Once the flight crew  had convinced themselves 
they were following the correct aircraft to land, the sudden realisation that they were

 wrong had a startle effect34 on them.  All participants in this incident were stood down 
from duty afterwards, to allow them to recover .  
Visual approach position in the landing sequence.  
Safety issue:  While  ATC sequence s an IFR a eroplane to land and approve s the flight crew to 
conduct a visual approach, current air traffic rules do not require controllers to provide flight 
crew with their position s in the approach sequence. This information can be crucial to a flight 
crew conducti ng a visual approach for them to maintain their situational awareness.  
3.41. The procedure for a flight crew on an IFR flight to make a visual approach to land is a 
recognised procedure and provided for in both international and New Zealand air-
traffic -managemen t procedures. In this incident, LINK285 sought and was approved to 
make a visual approach to land at Wellington  Airport  in accordance with the 
procedure.  
3.42. While MATS currently does not require a controller to provide a landing sequence for 
IFR aircraft conducting a visual approach, it does suggest that controllers provide such 
information that is available and appropriate to the situation. The approach controller 
clearly described the position of the aeroplane ahead in the circuit pattern that 
LINK285 was to follow by stating that it was,  "just turning onto base ". LINK285's 
position number in the sequence was known by the controller but not passed  on to the 
flight crew.  
3.43. The current air traffic rules are inconsistent on the minimum information co ntrollers are 
required to provide to pilots conducting a visual approach. The requirement s depend 
on whether the aircraft is operated under IFR or visual flight rules ( VFR). In both 
situations the flight crew are responsible for maintaining their own visua l separation 
from an aircraft ahead and need to develop an awareness of other aircraft in the 
landing pattern. In both situations the aeroplane's position in the landing sequence is 
information that the flight crew need to develop their situational awarene ss, but MATS 
only requires the sequence to be provided to a VFR flight when that pilot is issued with 
a clearance to follow another.  
3.44. When aircraft are flying in a rectangular pattern in a sequence to land, several aircraft 
could be visible to the rear pil ots in that sequence. Some aircraft may  be joining the 
sequence from another direction or lining up for another runway. Some may have 
changed to a tower frequency for landing. Those on the tower frequency may not be 
audible to pilots still under approach c ontrol. Therefore, when an IFR flight is 
conducting a visual approach to land, the aeroplane's position in the sequence 
becomes a significant factor in the pilots' situational awareness.  
3.45. Despite there being no formal requirement for a controller to provide  a flight crew with  
information on  their position in a landing sequence, there is no barrier to a flight crew 
asking for that information if they think  they need it. In this case, the LINK285 flight 
crew were not provided with a position in the approach sequence when the visual 
approach clearance was issued and did not ask for one .

Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 22 >>
 Radio frequency managemen t  
Safety issue: When an IFR aeroplane is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current 
ATC procedures can allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency 
dependent on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation wher e the approach 
controller is unable to contact that flight crew when the  controller is still responsible for 
monitoring that flight crew 's compliance with an  instruction .  
3.46. The flight crew of LINK285 were instructed to follow the Dash -8 ahead and maintain 
separation from it. Their next instruction was to change to tower frequency when they 
were on base leg. The point when the flight crew changed radio frequency was 
therefore left up to the flight crew to determine based on their decision  when they 
would  turn onto base leg.  
3.47. Usually this type of instruction would suffice , but it depends on the recipient 
identifying correct ly the  aircraft they are being instructed to follow. In this case t he 
approach controller did not realise the flight cr ew's mistake until the STCA  drew 
attention to a potential conflict . They then  found that the flight crew were not 
contactable because they  were  no longer on the approach frequency. This inability for 
the approach controller to communicate with LINK285 incr eased the risks by delaying  
corrective actions.  
3.48. According to the local Wellington air traffic operating procedures defined in MATS, the 
radio -frequency changeover point is near Baring Head or the TURAK reference point. 
This is close to where the actual ra dio frequency changeover took place. The  transfer of  
control from the approach controller to the tower controller , commenced  when 
LINK285 flight crew called the tower while on base leg . The transfer of control was not 
completed because the tower controller  did not respond.   
3.49. The approach controller remained responsible for ensuring  that IFR separation with 
aircraft other than the preceding  traffic, was applied to LINK285 until the control 
transition. MATS also instruct s tower controllers not to accept control of an 
approaching IFR aircraft unless appropriate separation can be applied. The approach 
controller  in this case  therefore made the first attempts to resolve the potential conflict 
but then had to relay through the  tower controller.  
Cockpit voice recorder s 
Safety issue: Potentially c ritical information on a serious  incident , recorded in two separate 
CVRs, was lost because  the recording s were not protected .  
3.50. Both flight crew s responded to TCAS -RA alert message s generated in their aeroplane s. 
This type of incident, where an avoidance manoeuvre is required to avoid a collision, is 
listed in ICAO Annex 13 as an example of a serious incident. Actions taken in this case 
demonstrated that it was also considered a serious incident. Airways stood down both 
controllers , and the tower controller passed a message to both flight crews to report to 
the duty manager after shutdown. Both captains discussed the incident with the duty 
manager before they left the c ockpit , then both flight crews were stood down . 
3.51. A CVR record s the last two hours of voice communications in a cockpit. The record ing 
is made in a continuous loop , so a recording older than two hours is overwritten by the 
current period. The first 30 minutes are recorded on four separate channels , but 
everything older than 30 minutes is blended onto a single channel from multiple 
microphone inputs.  
  
  Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 23 >>
 3.52. In this incident  the operator allowed both aircraft to fly their next leg s before the CVRs 
were disabled . Both aircraft were on the ground for about 30 minutes after landing , 
then flew the next flight leg s of about 40 minutes ' duration.  As a result of these delays 
in isolating the CVRs, critical voice recordings from the time of the incident were lost 
and others were difficult to separate and interpret.  
3.53. The Civil Aviation  Rules and the operator's standard operating procedures  both 
required the CVR  records to be protected a fter this serious incident.  The captain of 
LINK285 was aware of th is requirement but was focussed upon communicating to crew 
and duty staff.  Air New Zealand pointed out that it was a matter of jud gement 
whether an incident reached the threshold of 'serious'  as described in the company 
standard operating procedures. The investigation could not conclusively determine 
why the CVR circuit breakers were not pulled on each of the aircraft immediately after 
the incident at Wellington.  
3.54. Civil Aviation  Rules 12.103 , Preservation of Records stated:  
The holder of a certificate of registration of an aircraft that is involved in a 
serious incident or accident must preserve all records, including all recording 
media maintained for the operation and maintenance of the aircraft, for at least 
14 days after the serious incident or accident unless otherwise notified by the 
Authority.  
3.55. Air New Zealand Standard Operating Policies35 stated : 
To preserve the recording of any serious incident occurring within the recording 
duration prior to landing, the crew should:   
On completion of the aircraft shutdown checklist deactivate the CVR by pulling 
the circuit -breaker.   
Make an entry in the Technical Log that the CVR circuit -breaker has been pulled. 
A Safety Report must be submitte d.  
Note:   
Except as provided above, CVR circuit -breakers shall remain in at all times.  
3.56. The failure to preserve the CVR recording s also meant that the operator and the flight 
crew lost an opportunity to reflect on and learn from this incident.  
3.57. This issue has been a problem for other airline operators and investigation agencies for 
some time . International  safety organisations have made steps towards increas ing the 
CVR recording period . The United States National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) 
adopted  its safety recommendation report , Extended Duration Cockpit Voice Recorders 
(ASR -18-04) in 2018 . In the same year  it made two safety recommendations to the 
Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)36 to increase the recording duration of CVR 
records to at least 2 5 hours  for all new aircraft that require d CVRs and to retrofit  
existing aircraft CVRs to the same recording duration by 2024 .  
3.58. Subsequent to 2018 , the FAA technical standard order for CVRs (TSO -C123c) has been 
aligned with a European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment  (EUROCAE ) 
document , ED-112A, Minimum Operational Performance Specificat ion for Crash 
Protected Airborne Recorder Systems . ICAO has also revised its requirements for large 
 
35 Air New Zealand/ Air Nelson Standard Operating Policies , DHC8 -300 (Q300) , Chapter 4, Section 2 , Cockpit voice 
recorder (CVR) . (Revision 22, Nov 08, 2018 ) (See Appendix 3 ).  
36 NTSB Safety Recommendation A -18-030 and A -18-031 
 
Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 24 >>
 passenger aircraft : ICAO Annex 6 - Operation of Aircraft - Part 1 requires that new 
aircraft certified for a take -off mass greater than 27,000 kilogram s and first registered 
after January 2022 be equipped with CVR s that retain at least the last 25 hours of their 
operation.  New CVRs are available today  (2021 ) with the extended -duration recording 
period of 25 hours.  
3.59. The Commission is concerned that operators are not  recognising the importance of 
CVR records and the value they can provide to  post-incident and -accident 
investiga tions and learning . In 2009 the Commission made a recommendation to the 
New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA) about a late notification of a runway 
excursion at New Plymouth  by a Metroliner operated by Life Flight NZ . The delay  
allowed the aircraft to resume  operations after the incident and the CVR records to be 
overwritten (TAIC, 2009) . In 2017 a  Nelson -based ATR72 operated by Mount Cook 
Airline landed at Palmerston North with an undercarriage prob lem. The aeroplane was 
shut down on the runway and the CVR isolated by a Commission investigator after the 
incident . Ground crew subsequently repowered the CVR  when they started up the 
aeroplane to taxi it off the runway for repair. The CVR recording of the incident was 
overwritten  with ground crew conversations (TAIC, 2017) .

 4 Findings  
Ngā kitenge  
4.1. When the flight crew of LINK285 transitioned to a visual approach while on an  IFR 
flight  into Wellington Internation al Airport , they  mistakenly identified the first 
aeroplane in the sequence of three to land as the preceding aeroplane  to theirs . 
4.2. The flight crew  of LINK285 (No.3) then positioned their aeroplane behind the first 
aeroplane in the sequence of three , which put them on a converging flightpath  with 
the second aeroplane  in the sequence . 
4.3. The human defence layers , supplemented by automation incorporated into the air 
traffic control system , the aircraft systems  and the pilots' training,  meant the potential 
conflict  was detected and successfully resolved .  
4.4. The flight crew of LINK285 had not developed a complete mental image of other 
aircraft  relative to their own position in the landing pattern before they took over 
responsibility for maintaining th eir visual separation from the aeroplane they had 
identified ahead.  
4.5. The lighting and visual conditions prevailing at the time , and the known limitations of 
the human eye , made it more difficult for the LINK285 flight crew to identify the 
preceding aeroplan e visually .  
4.6. Further resources , such as Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems  and the air traffic control  
guidance available to the flight crew to help validate  their mental model s of their 
situation , were  not used.  
4.7. It was standard air-traffic -control procedure at the time to provide pilots on visual 
approach es with sufficient information to allow them to sequence correctly . This did 
not necessarily include the ir position in an approach procedure , but in t his case the 
position would have been crucial information for the pilot s' situational awareness.  
4.8. By allowing a flight crew on a visual approach to change radio frequency at their 
discretion , based on other clearance actions , meant the approach controller was 
unable to establish immediate communication with an aircraft within their control 
sector  and provide information about conflicting traffic .  
4.9. After  this serious incident, n either the flight crews from LINK235 and LINK285 nor the 
operator's ground crew isolated the cockpit voice recorder s immediately after the 
incident flight . This action was  required by the operator's standard operating 
procedures and by Civil Aviation Rules .

 5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1. Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.   
5.2. Safety i ssues may be addressed by saf ety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Safety issues  
ATC handover on visual approach  
5.3. The minimum information a controller is required to pass to an IFR flight crew about to 
commence a visual approach to land does not include their position in the landing 
sequence. This information significantl y aids  pilots in develop ing their situational 
awareness and maintain ing their visual separation from other aircraft .  
5.4. Airways  review ed this safety issue  through an internal working group and made 
changes  to address  the residual risk . This work resulted in an update to MATS Advisory 
Circular (MAC 7) to controllers , which  was p romulgated on 31 December 2020 . It 
included  a new section on visual approach procedures  that outlined the potential risk s 
and described best practice to prevent a reoccurrence . Therefore, the Commission has 
not made a recommendation.  
Radio frequency management  
5.5. The ATC practice of allowing an IFR flight making a visual approach into Wellington to 
change radio frequency at the pilot's discretion based on other clearance actions, can 
result in the approach controller losing radio contact with the flight while it is sti ll 
within their control sector.  
5.6. Airways  reviewed this safety issue through an internal working group and made 
changes to address the residual risk. This work resulted in an update to MATS Advisory 
Circular (MAC 7) to controllers that was promulgated on 31  December 2020. It 
included a new section on visual approach procedures that outlined the potential risk s 
and described best practice to prevent a reoccurrence. Therefore, the Commission has 
not made a recommendation.  
Cockpit voice recorder s 
5.7. The flight cre ws of LINK235 and LINK285  and the operator's supporting ground crew  at 
Wellington Airport failed to comply with both CAA rules and the operator's standard 
operating procedures regarding  protecting potentially critical evidence after a serious 
incident.  
5.8. Air New Zealand submitted that since this occurrence Air Nelson, the operator of the 
two Dash -8 aircraft, has been integrated with Air New Zealand and now come under 
the one common Air Operator Certificate (AOC). Air New Zealand has reviewed 
procedures and training requirements as part of this transition.  Flight crew technical  
  
  Final Report AO -2019 -002 
<< Page 27 >>
 refresher and recurre nt training and new flight crew  training for the Dash -8 (Q300) 
aircraft from 2022  will include specific reminders to pilots about isolating the CVR after 
a serious incident. Exampl es of serious incidents that match those recommended in 
Attachment C of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation are listed  
with the new training instruction  (see Appendix 4) . 
5.9. Air New  Zealand also stated th at all new Airbus A321 and Bo eing B787 aircraft 
delivered to Air New Zealand will have 25 -hour CVRs installed.  
5.10. The Commission would have made a safety  recommendation to address this issue . 
However, the Commission consider s that t he actions taken by Air New Zealand since 
this incident have adequately address ed this safety issue.  Therefore, the Commission 
has not made a safety recommendation.  
Other safety action  
5.11. Participants may take safety actions to address issues that would not n ormally result in 
the Commission issuing a recommendation  or in anticipation of a recommendation . 
The operator's safety actions  
5.12. The operator investigated this incident  and provided a copy of their report37 to the 
Commission .  
5.13. The operator  issued a safety bulletin to their flight crew s during April 2019  that 
describ ed the factual details of th is event.  This was followed by a safety briefing and 
workshop to review this incident and identify the human factors and lessons for other 
flight crew .  
5.14. A separate human factors workshop was convened in May 2019  for the operator's 
safety  team . Safety actions from that workshop were incorporated into the regional 
airlines ' human factors training.   
5.15. The operator considered there was  potential for confusion between  the LINK235  and 
LINK285  call signs because they were scheduled to arrive at Wellington  at similar times 
each day . They renamed the flight number s of LINK285  to LINK289 to minimise th is 
possibility in future . 
5.16. The operator raised several other points subsequent to the initial event about 
radiotelephony phraseology , controller actions , ATIS broadcasts  and the use of 
reporting point s38 that were not officially defined.  Some of these points were also 
raised in the Airways investigation.  
5.17. The operator's report did not mention the failure to isolate the CVR s in both 
aeroplanes .  
Airways safety action  
5.18. Airways investigated this incident and provided a copy of its report39 to the 
Commission.  Airways ' findings matched some that th e operator had raised about 
phras eology , controller actions , ATIS and reporting points.  Airways  also raised the issue 
of radio communications where the approach controller could not contact LINK285.

 5.19. The Airways report listed 11 safety actions , with projected completion dates ranging 
from November 2019 to 30 March 2020.  These included : 
• review visual approach procedures  
• review the conditions for changing radio frequency  on approach  
• review 'essential traffic ' phraseology  
• revise controller training for rec overing from a loss of separation  
• review the Wellington tower 's local unit orders instructions for updating ATIS  with 
cloud  
• consider METAR  (METeorological Aerodrome Report ) data for cloud  
• review local waypoints L YALL  and RIDGE  
• review traffic information provided to aircraft on visual approach .

 6 Recommendations  
Ngā tūtohutanga  
General   
6.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or 
organisation that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety 
issues, depending on whether  these safety issues are applicable to a single operator 
only or to the wider transport sector.  
6.2. In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurri ng in 
the future.   
6.3. For this incident, the operator and Airways carried out their own internal investigations  
and took action to address safety issues  they had identified .  The Commission would 
have issued safety recommendations,  but the action s taken by the operator and 
Airways had already addressed those safety issues. Therefore, the Commission has not 
made any safety recommendations.

 7 Key lessons  
Ngā akoranga matua  
7.1. The v isual identification of other aircraft can be challenging . Pilots should u se all 
available resources to build situation al awareness .  
7.2.  When a controller issue s a clearance , it is important  to monitor the flight crew's initial 
compliance  to check it has been interpreted as intended.  
7.3. TCAS equipment is an effective defence against mid -air collisions , and its display is also 
a useful instrument that flight crew can use for their situational awareness . 
7.4. Establishing criteria through recurrent messaging and training for flight crew on the 
definitions of what constitutes a seriou s incident is an important and continuous safety 
function for airlines. This will ensure that reporting and securing of safety data (such as 
from on -board recorders) occurs for all serious incidents and lessons are learned to 
avoid repeat occurrences .

 9 Conduct of the inquiry  
He tikanga rapunga  
9.1. On 12 March 2019  at 2046 , the CAA notified the Commission of this incident . The 
Commission subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointe d an investigator in charge.  
9.2. The Commission issued urgent instructions to the operator to protect the CVR 
recordings , but by the time the Commission had been notified of the incident, the 
aircraft had departed on their next leg s. The operator had not ground ed either aircraft  
immediately following the incident flight . The CVRs were not protected until after the 
end of the next leg . Consequently information about the incident was overwritten  and 
lost. 
9.3. The flight crew  from the two Dash -8s were interviewed  in Auckland , and the air traffic 
controllers were interviewed at their home bases in Wellington and Christchurch.  
9.4. Airways ' recordings of the radio and telephone conversations from the respective 
control desks were obtained. The recorded radar replay was examined at the Airways 
facilities in Christchurch and still screenshots taken at key points.   
9.5. An internal draft report was completed in November 20 20 but due to staff changes , 
held for a separate external review . A revised draft was submitted to the Commi ssion in 
July 20 21. Further work was required to recognise actions taken by interested persons .   
9.6. On 27 October 2021  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to  eight 
interested persons for their comment.  Submissions were received on 21 December 
2021 . 
9.7. Submissions were considered during January 2022 and a revised final draft report 
presented to the Commission for consideration in February 2022 . 
9.8. The final draft was approved in February 2022 and published on 14 April 2022.

 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngāti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai mārama' (i te ara 
haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of un derstanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling with in), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe' or 'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent s the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā h au e wh ā - the four winds  
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 'long 
white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a  'Aviation '.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of t his Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for 'Maritime .  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells wi thin) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
