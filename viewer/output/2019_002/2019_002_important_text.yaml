  \ main purpose of controlled airspace , air traffic control and IFR is to create\
  \ safe \npathways for air traffic  and to avoid potential collisions. Therefore,\
  \ when two aircraft \nconverg e too close ly in controlled airspace , causing the\
  \ activation of aircraft or ATC-\nbased alerts, it is classified as a serious incident.\
  \  \n3.2. This incident resulted in a STCA alert to the air traffic controllers\
  \ followed by  a TCAS -\nRA warning to the two flight crew s involved . The automated\
  \ activation of these \nimportant  safety warning systems  is evidence that they\
  \ worked correctly in the \nbackground and as intended  to prevent accidents.  \n\
  3.3. The potential  aircraft conflict was detected and avoided . The two aircraft\
  \ subsequently \nlanded without further incident and the passengers  were  very\
  \ likely  unaware  of what \nhad occurred .  \n3.4. This analysis examines the circumstances\
  \ and events leading up the TCAS activation \nand why the aeroplanes  were on conflicting\
  \ flight paths within controlled airspac e. It \nlooks at  the circumstances  and\
  \ factors that increased the likelihood of the event \noccurring and those that\
  \ were intended to preven t the incident . It also considers if any \nsafety issues\
  \ exist that could have the potential to adversely affect future operations.  \n\
  3.5. Three safety issue s were  identified :  \n\u2022 the approach sequence position\
  \ is critical information for pilots conducting visual \napproach es under IFR,\
  \ but controllers are not required  to provide  that information i n \na visual\
  \ approach clearance  \n\u2022 the association of radio handover to a tower controller\
  \ with other clearance actions \ncan result  in an approach controller losing  radio\
  \ contact with IFR traffic in their sector  \n\u2022 the operator did not preserve\
  \ and protect potentially critical evidence contained in \nthe CVRs immediately\
  \ after this serious incident .29 \nWhat happened  \n3.6. LINK2 85 was following\
  \ a STAR  to Runway  34 when the approach controller advised \nthat a visual approach\
  \ would be available.  The weather at the time was suitable for a \nvisual approach\
  \ into Wellington  and t he flight crew had visually identified an aeroplane \n\
  ahead.  \n3.7. The pilot flying  subsequently requested a vis ual approach. Once\
  \ approved, the pilot set \na course to follow the aeroplane  they had identified\
  \  ahead.  \n3.8. The flight crew of LINK285 had mistakenly identified JST290 as\
  \ the aeroplane ahead  \nthat they were to follow in the STAR procedure . They had\
  \ not seen LIN K235 , which was \nalso ahead and was the aeroplane they were meant\
  \ to follow . The flight crew \nproceeded to position LINK285 with appropriate separation,\
  \ behind JST290. They \n \n29 An incident with  a high probability of leading to\
  \ an accident. A sample list is provided in ICAO Annex 13, \nAttachment C  (ICAO,\
  \ 2016) . \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 16 >>\n turned onto the base\
  \ leg and changed frequency , then called Wellington tower in \naccor dance with\
  \ their clearance.  \n3.9. This movement took LINK285 onto a flight path that would\
  \ conflict with LINK235's \nflight path , and it activated the STCA. The STCA drew\
  \ the approach controller's \nattention back to LINK285, just as it was intended\
  \ to do. As the f light crew had \nchanged to the tower frequency, the approach\
  \ controller could not make radio contact \nwith LINK285.  \n3.10. In the meantime,\
  \ LINK235 was on its final approach  behind JST290. The flight crew \nwere scanning\
  \ their instruments and saw the other Dash -8 app ear on the TCAS display \nwithin\
  \ their airspace and approaching  from their right -hand  side. They were planning\
  \ \nto descend below glideslope30 to increase separation clearance.  \n3.11. The\
  \ crew of LINK285 reported to the Commission that they saw an unexpected aircraft\
  \ \non a conflicting flight path from their left and that they immediately commenced\
  \ a left \nturn to avoid it. The flight recorder data confirmed that the aeroplane\
  \ started a left \nturn approximately five seconds before the T CAS-RA activation.\
  \  \n3.12. The left turn by LINK285 initially brought the two aircraft into more\
  \ direct conflict , but \nas the turn progressed it took them further apart. The\
  \ TCAS activated in both Dash -8s, \nand the respective flight crews took action\
  \ as the systems directed to avoid the \nconflict.  \nResponsibility for separation\
  \  of aircraft  \n3.13. There are several safety barriers  to prevent regular passenger\
  \ transport aircraft flying \ntoo close to other aircraft . Pilots and air traffic\
  \ controllers  are responsible for managing  \nthe safety barriers that are applicable\
  \ to their  operational areas. In this case t he first \nresponsibility was with\
  \ the approach controller. In Class C airspace, the controller is \nresponsible\
  \ for maintaining separation between IFR aircraft and between IFR aircraft \nand\
  \ all other air traffic . This changed when the flight crew of LINK285 decided to\
  \  \naccept responsibility for their separation from the aircraft ahead and conduct\
  \ a visual \napproach. The approach controller 's responsibility was now to monitor\
  \ that LINK285 \nwas complying with their instruction , so maintained a general\
  \ awareness of LINK285's \nprogress.  \n3.14. Once t he flight crew of LINK285 \
  \ were  cleared for the visual approach , they were \nprimarily res ponsible for\
  \ ensuring their own separation from the aeroplane  they had \nbeen instructed to\
  \ follow . For this to work , they had to  identif y the correct aeroplane to \n\
  follow. When the flight crew misidentified the aircraft ahead and followed the wrong\
  \ \naeroplane, the remaining safety bar riers came  into effect . \n3.15. The next\
  \ safety barrier  to take effect was the automatic STCA . It was successful in \n\
  detecting a potential conflict between LINK285 and LINK235 and in drawing the \n\
  attention of both  the approach and the tower controllers to it in sufficient  time\
  \ for the \napproach controller to act . However, t he approach controller was unable\
  \ to contact \nLINK285 on the radio  because the flight crew were  in the process\
  \ of transitioning from \napproach to tower frequency as instructed and were no\
  \ longer monitoring the \napproach controller 's frequency.  This delayed  the approach\
  \ controller in re-\n \n30 An instrument landing system that indicates the proper\
  \ path of descent for an aircraft preparing to land  \n  \n  Final Report AO -2019\
  \ -002 \n<< Page 17 >>\n establishing contact and potentially issuing traffic information\
  \ or instructions to resolve \nthe conflict . \n3.16. The tower controller was also\
  \ aware that the STCA had activated and was assessing  the \nsituation .  When the\
  \ STCA activated, LINK285 had not yet contacted the tower  \ncontroller . Normal\
  \ procedure for handover between controllers is that aircraft released \nto th e\
  \ tower will have a suitable form of separation in place with no action required\
  \ by \nthe tower controller. The STCA created doubt for the two controllers about\
  \ the \nsequence  and separation .  \n3.17. The next safety barrier  to take effect\
  \ was the tower controller advising LINK285 of \n'essential traffic'  in its vicinity\
  \ . This call was initiated by the approach controller's \ntelephone conversation\
  \ with the tower controller. It was successful in further raising \nthe LINK285\
  \ flight crew's awarenes s of the conflict . The tower controller 's message \n\
  included guidance actions for the flight crew  to avoid the conflict .  \n3.18.\
  \ The next safety barrier  to take effect was the 'see and avoid' actions of the\
  \ respective \nflight crew s. These were  also effective , as the  flight crews\
  \ of LINK235 and LINK285 saw \neach other and initiated their own avoiding action\
  \ slightly before their respective \nTCAS s had warned them of the potential conflict\
  \ . \n3.19. The last safety barrier  to take effect was the TCAS . It work ed as\
  \ designed and alerted \nboth flight crews  to a potential mid-air collision and\
  \ provid ed visual and aural \ninstructions for them to avoid it.   \nHow did the\
  \ flight crew of LINK285 mistakenly identify JST290 as \nLINK235 ? \n3.20. The flight\
  \ crew of LINK285  mistakenly visually  ident ified an A320 on its final approach\
  \  \nas a Dash -8 on the base leg.  This may seem improbable  given  that t he A320\
  \ is a low-\nwing , twin-engine  jet aeroplane, while a Dash -8 is a high wing,\
  \ T -tail, twin-engine \nturboprop aeroplane. The flight crew were experienced pilots\
  \ attempting  to identify an \naeroplane  that was  the same as the one they were\
  \ flying  and operated by the same \ncompany . They were also familiar where aircraft\
  \ would be on each leg of the approach \npattern into Wellington Airport .  \n3.21.\
  \ This section discusses the possible factors that contribut ed to the flight crew\
  \ of \nLINK285  misidentifying the aeroplane that the approach controller had instruct\
  \ ed them \nto follow. It also outlines the rules in place for this situation and\
  \ the defences in place \nintended to prevent one aeroplane  getting too close to\
  \ another .  \nPossible contributing factors that were excluded  \n3.22. Several\
  \ factors could have contributed to this incident , but t here was no evidence to\
  \ \nsupport the following  items , so they were rejected.  \n\u2022 Licensing: The\
  \ LINK285 flight crew had the appropriate experience and licences to fly \nthe aeroplane.\
  \  \n\u2022 Workload: The weather was fine and the flight crew were not dealing\
  \ with any sort of \nemergency situation or system failure. There were  only two\
  \ other aircraft in the \napproach tr affic. The cockpit was reported by the flight\
  \ crew to have been 'sterile' with \nno distractions. This situation would have\
  \ been  unlikely  to present a high workload for \nexperienced pilots.  \n \nFinal\
  \ Report AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 18 >>\n \u2022 Fatigue: Both pilots in LINK285\
  \ had had adequate rest since their pre vious duty time \nand said they were alert\
  \ and focused on the tasks at hand.  \n\u2022 Familiarity: The flight crew stated\
  \ they had briefed for the approach at the top of the \ndescent and were both expecting\
  \ a standard instrument terminal -arrival route through \nthe way points to Runway\
  \ 34. Although they had not briefed for a visual approach that \ncould deviate from\
  \ the IFR route, they had both  flown visual approaches to Wellington \nalong this\
  \ route  before . \n\u2022 Weather: The weather was fine  with scattered cloud \
  \ clearing from  the south of \nWellington. The v isual clearance from cloud was\
  \ assured and the horizontal visibility \ndistance was suitable for visual flight\
  \ conditions.  \n\u2022 Pilot interactions: The captain and first officer both said\
  \ they worked well as a team. \nNeither pilot expressed any concern about their\
  \ working relationship in the cockpit.   \nSituational awareness  \n3.23. LINK285\
  \ was on a planned IFR descent profile31 under the control of the approach \ncontroller.\
  \ The approach controller was , at that time, responsible for ensuring \nappropriate\
  \ separation from other aircraft,  but the flight crew were  about to transition\
  \ \nto a visual approach . \n3.24. The flight crew  needed to update their awareness\
  \  of other aircraft in the approach \npattern  in preparation for conducting a\
  \ visual approach . A pilot gains situational \nawareness by their perce ption and\
  \ interpretation  of the information they receive \nthrough their senses. This includes\
  \  from visually scanning outside, scanning the flight \ninstruments  and listening\
  \ to radio chatter . Where an aircraft has two pilots, they share \nthe workload\
  \ and confer on their respective observations.  This helps them to build a \nshared\
  \ picture  of other aircraft in the airspace around them.  \n3.25. The flight crew\
  \ of LINK285 said, during an interview, that they were listening to the \nWellington\
  \ approach frequency and heard instructions being issued to LINK235 and \nJST290.\
  \ This indicate d that there were at least two preceding aircraft in the approach\
  \ \nsequence  before they went  visual .  \n3.26. According to  the ICAO proced\
  \ ures for an IFR flight , to make a visual approach32 the \npilot needs to positively\
  \ identify aircraft they have been instructed to follow and the \ncontroller needs\
  \ to monitor the pilot's actions. The guidance for controllers is stated in \nMATS33\
  \ as: \nAfter clea ring an aircraft for a visual approach and to follow another\
  \ aircraft \nvisually, radar controllers should continue to monitor the aircraft\
  \ in order to \nconfirm that the correct aircraft is being followed.  \n3.27. At\
  \ 1730:45, two minutes before the TCAS -RA, the radar  display for the Wellington\
  \ \napproach showed LINK235 approximately 8  nm ahead and slightly to the left of\
  \  the \ntrack of LINK285, while JST290 was approximately 9  nm ahead and slightly\
  \ to the right \nof the track of LINK285 (see Figure 7). \n3.28. The flight crew\
  \ were required to identify the aeroplane ahead that was just turning \nonto base.\
  \ JST290 was on  its final approach  at the time. The flight crew o f LINK285 and\

  \ RAC 6, section 17.7 . \n  \n  Final Report AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 19 >>\n the\
  \ approach controller were  both confident that LINK235 had been correctly \nidentified\
  \  as the aircraft ahead . The approach controller then switch ed their attention\
  \  \nto another aircraft arriving at Wellington on the other side of their screen.\
  \  \n \nFigure 7: Airways radar - positions of JST290, LINK235 and LINK285 at 1730:45\
  \  \n  \n3.29. While the relative positions of aircraft on the radar screen  were\
  \ clear to the approach \ncontroller, the pilots in LINK285 did not have the same\
  \ perspective .  \n3.30. At 1730:45 , when the LINK285 flight crew stated they had\
  \ LINK235 in sight ahead, the \nsun was approximately 24 \xB0 above the horizon\
  \ and to their right. The pilot flying  \nrecalled that conditions were suitable\
  \ for a visual approach . There was s ome cloud  \naround but the sun was low in\
  \ the sky and it was clearer of cloud to the south. The \npilot monitoring  had\
  \ noted that co lour clarity was poor.  \n3.31. At that time LINK235 was approximately\
  \ 6 nm ahead, 2,800 feet below and flying \ndirectly away from LINK285 (see Figure\
  \ 4). It would have presented as a small cross -\nsectional area with little to\
  \ no sun reflection and have had very little contrast or relative \nmovement against\
  \ the background. It would have been difficult for the flight crew of \nLINK285\
  \ to see and visually identify the other Dash -8. \n3.32. Conve rsely, JST290 was\
  \ about the same distance away from LINK285 but lower down \nand slightly to its\
  \ right -hand side and flying towards it. The sun would  likely  have been \nhighlighting\
  \ the upper surfaces of JST290 against the contrasting darker sea, making \nits\
  \ re lative movement more obvious.  \n3.33. At 6 nm a pilot would be challenged\
  \ to distinguish an other  aircraft's details and colour \nscheme. The human eye\
  \ could detect an object's movement and distinguish that it was \nan aircraft at\
  \ that distance,  but the visual acuity of details may not be as clear.   \n3.34.\
  \ The image derived by a human eye may seem convincing and true to the eye's owner,\
  \ \nbut the human eye is well known to have imperfections and be subject to illusionary\
  \ \neffects at times.  \nLink285  \nLink235  \nJST290  \n2-minute range line  \n\

  \ (Davis, Johnson, Stepanek, & \nFogarty, 2008) , the visual function of the eye\
  \ is described as:  \nThe visual apparatus, stimulated by light, must primarily\
  \ perform three basic \nfunction s. It must be able to perceive an object by the\
  \ detection of light emitted \nor reflected from it; this is known as light discrimination.\
  \ Second, it must be able \nto perceive the details of an object; this is known\
  \ as visual acuity. Third, it must \nallow one t o judge distances from objects\
  \ and to perceive movement in the \nfield of vision. These latter two functions\
  \ combined are known as spatial \ndiscrimination.  \n3.36. The flight crew in L\
  \ INK285 looked ahead for LINK235 where they expected it to be and \nsaw an aeroplane\
  \ . They agreed it was LINK235  but they had likely  experienced \nconfirmation\
  \ bias.  \nConfirmation Bias is the tendency to look for information that supports,\
  \ rather \nthan rejects, one's preconceptions, typically by interpreting evidence\
  \ to confirm \nexisting beliefs while rejecting or ignoring any conflicting data\
  \  (Noor, 2020) . \n3.37. Both the pilot flying  and pilot monitoring  LINK285 recalled\
  \ in separate interviews that \nthe pilot flying  had located the aircraft ahead\
  \ (this was J ST290) and pointed it out to \nthe pilot monitoring . The pilot flying\
  \  recalled that, initially , the pilot monitoring  had \nhad difficulty identifying\
  \ the aircraft ahead, but eventually they had both believed it \nwas LINK235.  \n\
  3.38. The LINK285 flight crew had other information  available that conflicted with\
  \ their \nagreed identification of LINK235  at this time, but they did not focus\
  \ their attention on \nit. For example:  \n\u2022 the LINK285 flight crew heard\
  \ the approach controller pass the control of JST 290 to  \nthe tower  immediately\
  \ before receiving their own clearance to descend. That meant \nthey were one of\
  \ three aircraft in the landing sequence.  They had identif ied one \naeroplane\
  \ in front, but where was the othe r? \n\u2022 the Dash -8 ahead was described by\
  \ the approach controller as turning onto  base leg , \nbut the A320 that they thought\
  \ was LINK235  was on its final approach . This was a \ndifferent position in the\
  \ landing pattern,  and it was heading in a different direction  \nfrom  LINK235\
  \  \n\u2022 there is a significant difference between  the shape  of a Dash -8 and\
  \  that of  an A320.  \n3.39. The TCAS  would have displayed information that also\
  \ conflicted with  the crew's  mental \nmodel . The TCAS range was set to detect\
  \ and display other aircraft with transponders \nin a 12 nm radius of airspace around\
  \ the aeroplane. Both JST290 and LINK235 were \nabout 6 nm away from LINK285 and\
  \ their targets would have been visible  on the TCAS \ndisplay as open or solid\
  \ , cyan-coloured diamond s. The pilots in LINK285 said they did \nnot check t heir\
  \ TCAS display until after they saw an unexpected object to their left . \nThey\
  \ used the TCAS to confirm  it was an aircraft  target . \n3.40. The LINK285 flight\
  \ crew's reliance on  the visual identification of the aeroplane they had \nbeen\
  \ directed to follow , without considering  alternative sources of verification\
  \ , led to \ntheir misidentif ying that aeroplane. Once the flight crew  had convinced\
  \ themselves \nthey were following the correct aircraft to land, the sudden realisation\
  \ that they were \n  \n  Final Report AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 21 >>\n wrong had\
  \ a startle effect34 on them.  All participants in this incident were stood down\
  \ \nfrom duty afterwards, to allow them to recover .  \nVisual approach position\
  \ in the landing sequence.  \nSafety issue:  While  ATC sequence s an IFR a eroplane\
  \ to land and approve s the flight crew to \nconduct a visual approach, current\
  \ air traffic rules do not require controllers to provide flight \ncrew with their\
  \ position s in the approach sequence. This information can be crucial to a flight\
  \ \ncrew conducti ng a visual approach for them to maintain their situational awareness.\
  \  \n3.41. The procedure for a flight crew on an IFR flight to make a visual approach\
  \ to land is a \nrecognised procedure and provided for in both international and\
  \ New Zealand air-\ntraffic -managemen t procedures. In this incident, LINK285 sought\
  \ and was approved to \nmake a visual approach to land at Wellington  Airport  in\
  \ accordance with the \nprocedure.  \n3.42. While MATS currently does not require\
  \ a controller to provide a landing sequence for \nIFR aircraft conducting a visual\
  \ approach, it does suggest that controllers provide such \ninformation that is\
  \ available and appropriate to the situation. The approach controller \nclearly\
  \ described the position of the aeroplane ahead in the circuit pattern that \nLINK285\
  \ was to follow by stating that it was,  \"just turning onto base \". LINK285's\
  \ \nposition number in the sequence was known by the controller but not passed \
  \ on to the \nflight crew.  \n3.43. The current air traffic rules are inconsistent\
  \ on the minimum information co ntrollers are \nrequired to provide to pilots conducting\
  \ a visual approach. The requirement s depend \non whether the aircraft is operated\
  \ under IFR or visual flight rules ( VFR). In both \nsituations the flight crew\
  \ are responsible for maintaining their own visua l separation \nfrom an aircraft\
  \ ahead and need to develop an awareness of other aircraft in the \nlanding pattern.\
  \ In both situations the aeroplane's position in the landing sequence is \ninformation\
  \ that the flight crew need to develop their situational awarene ss, but MATS \n\
  only requires the sequence to be provided to a VFR flight when that pilot is issued\
  \ with \na clearance to follow another.  \n3.44. When aircraft are flying in a rectangular\
  \ pattern in a sequence to land, several aircraft \ncould be visible to the rear\
  \ pil ots in that sequence. Some aircraft may  be joining the \nsequence from another\
  \ direction or lining up for another runway. Some may have \nchanged to a tower\
  \ frequency for landing. Those on the tower frequency may not be \naudible to pilots\
  \ still under approach c ontrol. Therefore, when an IFR flight is \nconducting a\
  \ visual approach to land, the aeroplane's position in the sequence \nbecomes a\
  \ significant factor in the pilots' situational awareness.  \n3.45. Despite there\
  \ being no formal requirement for a controller to provide  a flight crew with  \n\
  information on  their position in a landing sequence, there is no barrier to a flight\
  \ crew \nasking for that information if they think  they need it. In this case,\
  \ the LINK285 flight \ncrew were not provided with a position in the approach sequence\
  \ when the visual \napproach clearance was issued and did not ask for one . \n \n\

  << Page 22 >>\n Radio frequency managemen t  \nSafety issue: When an IFR aeroplane\
  \ is approved to conduct a visual approach to land, current \nATC procedures can\
  \ allow the flight crew to change their radio to the tower frequency \ndependent\
  \ on their other clearance actions. This can create a situation wher e the approach\
  \ \ncontroller is unable to contact that flight crew when the  controller is still\
  \ responsible for \nmonitoring that flight crew 's compliance with an  instruction\
  \ .  \n3.46. The flight crew of LINK285 were instructed to follow the Dash -8 ahead\
  \ and maintain \nseparation from it. Their next instruction was to change to tower\
  \ frequency when they \nwere on base leg. The point when the flight crew changed\
  \ radio frequency was \ntherefore left up to the flight crew to determine based\
  \ on their decision  when they \nwould  turn onto base leg.  \n3.47. Usually this\
  \ type of instruction would suffice , but it depends on the recipient \nidentifying\
  \ correct ly the  aircraft they are being instructed to follow. In this case t he\
  \ \napproach controller did not realise the flight cr ew's mistake until the STCA\
  \  drew \nattention to a potential conflict . They then  found that the flight crew\
  \ were not \ncontactable because they  were  no longer on the approach frequency.\
  \ This inability for \nthe approach controller to communicate with LINK285 incr\
  \ eased the risks by delaying  \ncorrective actions.  \n3.48. According to the local\
  \ Wellington air traffic operating procedures defined in MATS, the \nradio -frequency\
  \ changeover point is near Baring Head or the TURAK reference point. \nThis is close\
  \ to where the actual ra dio frequency changeover took place. The  transfer of \
  \ \ncontrol from the approach controller to the tower controller , commenced  when\
  \ \nLINK285 flight crew called the tower while on base leg . The transfer of control\
  \ was not \ncompleted because the tower controller  did not respond.   \n3.49. The\
  \ approach controller remained responsible for ensuring  that IFR separation with\
  \ \naircraft other than the preceding  traffic, was applied to LINK285 until the\
  \ control \ntransition. MATS also instruct s tower controllers not to accept control\
  \ of an \napproaching IFR aircraft unless appropriate separation can be applied.\
  \ The approach \ncontroller  in this case  therefore made the first attempts to\
  \ resolve the potential conflict \nbut then had to relay through the  tower controller.\
  \  \nCockpit voice recorder s \nSafety issue: Potentially c ritical information\
  \ on a serious  incident , recorded in two separate \nCVRs, was lost because  the\
  \ recording s were not protected .  \n3.50. Both flight crew s responded to TCAS\
  \ -RA alert message s generated in their aeroplane s. \nThis type of incident, where\
  \ an avoidance manoeuvre is required to avoid a collision, is \nlisted in ICAO Annex\
  \ 13 as an example of a serious incident. Actions taken in this case \ndemonstrated\
  \ that it was also considered a serious incident. Airways stood down both \ncontrollers\
  \ , and the tower controller passed a message to both flight crews to report to\
  \ \nthe duty manager after shutdown. Both captains discussed the incident with the\
  \ duty \nmanager before they left the c ockpit , then both flight crews were stood\
  \ down . \n3.51. A CVR record s the last two hours of voice communications in a\
  \ cockpit. The record ing \nis made in a continuous loop , so a recording older\
  \ than two hours is overwritten by the \ncurrent period. The first 30 minutes are\
  \ recorded on four separate channels , but \neverything older than 30 minutes is\
  \ blended onto a single channel from multiple \nmicrophone inputs.  \n  \n  Final\
  \ Report AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 23 >>\n 3.52. In this incident  the operator allowed\
  \ both aircraft to fly their next leg s before the CVRs \nwere disabled . Both aircraft\
  \ were on the ground for about 30 minutes after landing , \nthen flew the next flight\
  \ leg s of about 40 minutes ' duration.  As a result of these delays \nin isolating\
  \ the CVRs, critical voice recordings from the time of the incident were lost \n\
  and others were difficult to separate and interpret.  \n3.53. The Civil Aviation\
  \  Rules and the operator's standard operating procedures  both \nrequired the CVR\
  \  records to be protected a fter this serious incident.  The captain of \nLINK285\
  \ was aware of th is requirement but was focussed upon communicating to crew \n\
  and duty staff.  Air New Zealand pointed out that it was a matter of jud gement\
  \ \nwhether an incident reached the threshold of 'serious'  as described in the\
  \ company \nstandard operating procedures. The investigation could not conclusively\
  \ determine \nwhy the CVR circuit breakers were not pulled on each of the aircraft\
  \ immediately after \nthe incident at Wellington.  \n3.54. Civil Aviation  Rules\
  \ 12.103 , Preservation of Records stated:  \nThe holder of a certificate of registration\
  \ of an aircraft that is involved in a \nserious incident or accident must preserve\
  \ all records, including all recording \nmedia maintained for the operation and\
  \ maintenance of the aircraft, for at least \n14 days after the serious incident\
  \ or accident unless otherwise notified by the \nAuthority.  \n3.55. Air New Zealand\
  \ Standard Operating Policies35 stated : \nTo preserve the recording of any serious\
  \ incident occurring within the recording \nduration prior to landing, the crew\
  \ should:   \nOn completion of the aircraft shutdown checklist deactivate the CVR\
  \ by pulling \nthe circuit -breaker.   \nMake an entry in the Technical Log that\
  \ the CVR circuit -breaker has been pulled. \nA Safety Report must be submitte d.\
  \  \nNote:   \nExcept as provided above, CVR circuit -breakers shall remain in at\
  \ all times.  \n3.56. The failure to preserve the CVR recording s also meant that\
  \ the operator and the flight \ncrew lost an opportunity to reflect on and learn\
  \ from this incident.  \n3.57. This issue has been a problem for other airline operators\
  \ and investigation agencies for \nsome time . International  safety organisations\
  \ have made steps towards increas ing the \nCVR recording period . The United States\
  \ National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) \nadopted  its safety recommendation\
  \ report , Extended Duration Cockpit Voice Recorders \n(ASR -18-04) in 2018 . In\
  \ the same year  it made two safety recommendations to the \nFederal Aviation Administration\
  \  (FAA)36 to increase the recording duration of CVR \nrecords to at least 2 5 hours\
  \  for all new aircraft that require d CVRs and to retrofit  \nexisting aircraft\
  \ CVRs to the same recording duration by 2024 .  \n3.58. Subsequent to 2018 , the\
  \ FAA technical standard order for CVRs (TSO -C123c) has been \naligned with a European\
  \ Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment  (EUROCAE ) \ndocument , ED-112A, Minimum\
  \ Operational Performance Specificat ion for Crash \nProtected Airborne Recorder\
  \ Systems . ICAO has also revised its requirements for large \n \n35 Air New Zealand/\
  \ Air Nelson Standard Operating Policies , DHC8 -300 (Q300) , Chapter 4, Section\
  \ 2 , Cockpit voice \nrecorder (CVR) . (Revision 22, Nov 08, 2018 ) (See Appendix\
  \ 3 ).  \n36 NTSB Safety Recommendation A -18-030 and A -18-031 \n \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2019 -002 \n<< Page 24 >>\n passenger aircraft : ICAO Annex 6 - Operation\
  \ of Aircraft - Part 1 requires that new \naircraft certified for a take -off mass\
  \ greater than 27,000 kilogram s and first registered \nafter January 2022 be equipped\
  \ with CVR s that retain at least the last 25 hours of their \noperation.  New CVRs\
  \ are available today  (2021 ) with the extended -duration recording \nperiod of\
  \ 25 hours.  \n3.59. The Commission is concerned that operators are not  recognising\
  \ the importance of \nCVR records and the value they can provide to  post-incident\
  \ and -accident \ninvestiga tions and learning . In 2009 the Commission made a recommendation\
  \ to the \nNew Zealand Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA) about a late notification\
  \ of a runway \nexcursion at New Plymouth  by a Metroliner operated by Life Flight\
  \ NZ . The delay  \nallowed the aircraft to resume  operations after the incident\
  \ and the CVR records to be \noverwritten (TAIC, 2009) . In 2017 a  Nelson -based\
  \ ATR72 operated by Mount Cook \nAirline landed at Palmerston North with an undercarriage\
  \ prob lem. The aeroplane was \nshut down on the runway and the CVR isolated by\
  \ a Commission investigator after the \nincident . Ground crew subsequently repowered\
  \ the CVR  when they started up the \naeroplane to taxi it off the runway for repair.\
  \ The CVR recording of the incident was \noverwritten  with ground crew conversations\
