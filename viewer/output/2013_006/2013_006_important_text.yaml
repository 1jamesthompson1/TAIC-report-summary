  \  \n4.1.1.  A misalig ned take -off is a form of 'runway excursion ', in which\
  \ an aeroplane goes off the side \nor end of the intended runway.  It is therefore\
  \  a 'serious incident' . These eve nts are rare, but \nthe potential contributory\
  \ factors identified in the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's study \nare often\
  \ present  and some were in th is incident.  \n4.1.2.  In this case  the aeroplane\
  \ 's undercarriage remained on the strengthened runway shoulder , so \nthere was\
  \ no damage to  the surface and therefore a low risk of major damage to the \naeroplane\
  \ .  The principal risk was damage to some of the aeroplane's  tyres and any \n\
  consequence s of that for the take -off and subsequent landing .  In addition, the\
  \ presenc e of \nunreported debris created a hazard for following flights . \n4.1.3.\
  \  Runway misalignments at Auckland at night have not been common.  A database search\
  \ \nrevealed five events since 2005, mostly  involving light, single or twin-engine\
  \  domestic \naeroplanes .  Three of these occurred at  the other end o f the r\
  \ unway , and one on runway 23 \nLeft but at taxiway A 2.  The fifth occurrence\
  \  involved  a medium -size aircraft  at the same entry \ntaxiway as for this incident.\
  \  Auckland -based pilots of large aeroplanes had not reported \nthrough their operators'\
  \ safety management systems  any concerns for the runway -taxiway \nentry .   \n\
  4.1.4.  Both of the A340 pilots were experienced in their respective positions and\
  \ both were familiar \nwith night and day operations at Auckland . \n4.1.5.  The\
  \ pilots were not fatigued.  Both said they had slept well  the night before and\
  \ felt alert for \nthe flight.  Their workload in preparing for this flight had\
  \ been  normal.  The flight commenced \non schedule and the pilots were not in a\
  \ hurry or under time pr essure.  They completed their \nchecklists  in good time\
  \ to be ready for take -off as soon as the tower controller provided the \ntake-off\
  \ clearance.  The air traffic movements were steady at near two-minute intervals.\
  \  \n4.1.6.  The tower had previously clear ed the aerop lane to line up on the\
  \ runway and then gave \nclearance to take  off just as the aeroplane began to \
  \ follow the curve of the taxiway lead -in line \nto the runway centreline.  Th\
  \ e captain had anticipated  the early take -off clearance, which  gave \nhim the\
  \ option of making a rolling take -off.  The operator considered a rolling take\
  \ -off to be a \nnormal procedure.  Both pilots said they had not been distracted\
  \ at that time by non -\noperational activities.  \n4.1.7.  The following analysis\
  \ discusses  factors that may have cont ributed to the aeroplane being \nmisaligned\
  \ on the runway edge during the take -off.  It also discusses the safety issue of\
  \ not \nreporting an incident that result s, or may result,  in debris being left\
  \ on the runway.  \n4.1.8.  Also discussed are two safety issues that may or may\
  \  not have  contribute d to the incident , but \nin the interests of transport\
  \ safety should be addressed:  \n\uF0B7 differences between the intensity settings\
  \ used on the night of this incident for runway \nand taxiway lights and  the ICAO\
  \ -recommended settings for similar conditions  \n\uF0B7 administrative errors were\
  \ identified in the advisory circular AC139 -6 current at the time \nof this incident\
  \ , which had the  potential to create  ambiguity in the way the relevant  ICAO\
  \ \nstandards and recommended practices for airport design and oper ations  were\
  \ \ninterpreted . \n4.2. The incident  \n4.2.1.  The weather had no influence on\
  \ the incident.  The night was clear with 20 kilometres ' \nvisibility  and the\
  \  runway surface was damp from recent showers . \n4.2.2.  The captain said that\
  \ a t night and in low -visibility conditions he normally use d the taxiway and\
  \ \nrunway lighting rather than the markings to guide him while taxiing.  H e was\
  \ doing that when \nFinal report AO -2013 -006 \n<< Page 13 >>\n the incident occurred\
  \ .  The paint ed markings were also visible at night with the aeroplane's \nlights.\
  \   \n4.2.3.  Taxiway centreline lights are flush -mounted  and green and have narrow\
  \ light beam s aligned \nwith the taxiway centreline ( Figure 7).  On curved centrelines\
  \ different  fitting s with wider  \nbeam s are  used .  These are spaced more close\
  \ ly, with the centre of their beams toed in \ntowards the centre of the curve radius\
  \ , so that at least three lights are visible to a pilot as an \naeroplane tracks\
  \ around the curve.   \n4.2.4.  Runway centreline lights are also flush  mounted\
  \ , but have white light s with narrowly focused \nbeam s aligned with the centre\
  \ of the runway.   \n4.2.5.  Runway edge lights are mounted on pedestals 300 m illimetres\
  \  above the runway surface , but \nwhere aeroplanes may roll over them  they are\
  \ flush -mounted .  The elevated  runway edge \nlights have  narrow , high-intensity\
  \ beam s angled in towards the runway centre at three  degrees \nfrom the edge line\
  \ , and  omnidirectional beam s.   \n4.2.6.  When a n aeroplane is correctly aligned\
  \ on the runway centreline, the runway edge and \ncentreline lights appear as three\
  \ white lines converging in the far distance , with the edge \nlights brighter than\
  \ the centreline  lights .   \n4.2.7.  In this incident  the captain accurately\
  \ followed the taxiway centreline  onto the runway , but \nthen  he made  a sharp\
  \ turn to line up on the edge lights.  Figure 8 and Figure 9 give a daytime \nand\
  \ night -time perspective of how the runway lights would have looked to t he captain\
  \ after he \nhad lined up the aeroplane with the runway edge lights .  The night\
  \ -time view in  Figure 9 could \nbe slightly deceptive because the digital camera\
  \ setting19 required to get a clear picture would \nbe different from the human\
  \ eye's response to the scene.  \n4.2.8.  The captain 's attention to following\
  \ the green taxiway lead -in lights would have been diverted \nwhen he lo oked outside\
  \ for other traffic and then up to the overhead panel to turn on the \n        \
  \                                                \n19 ISO 1600, F2.8, with a one\
  \ -secon d exposure time and taken at 1840 eight days after the incident.  \nFigure\

  \  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -006 landing lights.  When he looked\
  \ out again, t he bright er landing lights reflecting off the concrete \nrunway\
  \ may have diminished the visibility of the taxiway centreline  lights, although\
  \  the paint \nmarking would have become more visible.    \n4.2.9.  ICAO's guidance\
  \ to best practice on the flight deck from the Manual on the Prevention of \nRunway\
  \ Incursions (ICAO, 2007, pp. App B -2) recommends planning th e timing and execution\
  \ \nof checklists to have 'all eyes outside ' during entry to the runway.  The operator's\
  \ standard \noperating procedures gave the captain the choice of switching on  the\
  \ landing  lights  personally  \nor requesting the first officer to do so .  Best\
  \ practice in this case would have been for the \ncaptain to request the first officer\
  \ to switch on the lights so that he could remain looking \noutside the aeroplane.\
  \  The captain said that when he looked back outside to continue the \nturn onto\
  \ the runway h e presumed the 'line of very high intensity lights' were the centreline\
  \ \nlights and aligned the aeroplane with them.  The tight turn to align suggest\
  \ s that his mistake \noccurred after he had lost his previous lead -in cues. \n\

  \ surface)  \n \nFigure 9 \nRunway 23  Left view while aligned with the edge lights\

  \  \nrunway edge lights  \nFinal report AO -2013 -006 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.2.10.\
  \  Once aligned , the runway lights should have appeared as three white lines converging\
  \ at a \nsingle point in the distance.  At a glance, i t is possible to gain  a\
  \ visual impression that the \nrunway edge lights are the centreline , but only\
  \ if the line of illuminated movement  area \nguidance signs are mistaken for the\
  \ right -hand  runway edge lights  (see Figure 9).  It was \nsuggested that t his\
  \ type of illusion was present  in the incident at Los Angeles  International \n\
  Airport  (see paragraph 3.6.3 above ).  \n4.2.11.  However, if either pilot had\
  \ taken the time to make a closer inspection, they would have seen \nthat the relative\
  \ intensity and spacing of the three lines of lights was not normal  when lined\
  \ up \non the edge lights .  The rolling take -off reduced the opportunity for either\
  \ pilot to recogni se \nthis mistake . \n4.2.12.  The aeroplane had some navigation\
  \ system  feature s that could  have show n the aeroplane's \nposition relative\
  \ to the runway centreline ; for example , the localiser beam of the  runway  \n\
  instrument landing system  could be switched to indicate alignment on the primary\
  \ flight \ndisplay .  The operator's flight crew operating manual did refer to the\
  \ benefit s of th ese cross -\ncheck s for take -off in low visibility .  However,\
  \ it was not  usual for pilots to use these features \nwhen visibility was good,\
  \ as it was on this night , and n either pilot had them  selected for this \ntake-off.\
  \  The operator subsequently amended its manual to encourage the routine use of\
  \ on -\nboard systems that show pilot s they are lined up in the centre of the correct\
  \ runway.  \n4.3. Debris on the runway  \n4.3.1.  The captain realised that he had\
  \ aligned the aeroplane on the edge lights as shown  by his \ncorrection partway\
  \ through the take -off and his subsequent conversation with the first office r\
  \ \nafter take -off.  However, he  did not report the incident to the tower controller.\
  \  That decision  \nput following flights at risk.  \n4.3.2.  Debris from broken\
  \ edge lights lay scattered on the runway edge for nearly three hours until it \n\
  was discovered during the next daylight runway inspection .   \n4.3.3.  Debris left\
  \ on runways has contributed to accidents and incidents, so it is  essential  that\
  \ any \neven t that may have caused debris  to be left on the runway is reported\
  \ as soon as practicable \nto air traffic control .  \n4.4. Taxiway and runway lighting\
  \ systems  \n4.4.1.  Auckland International Airport Limited  (the airport operator\
  \ ) has an aerodrome operator's \ncertificate iss ued under Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ Part 139.  The assets used for guiding aircraft \nmovements , such as the control\
  \ tower, airport lighting and navigation systems , are separately \nowned and operated\
  \ by Airways.  The airport operator is responsible for the operati on and \nmaintenance\
  \ of these systems in accordance with its operating certificate, but contracts th\
  \ ose \nfunctions to Airways.  \n4.4.2.  The international standard s and recommended\
  \ practices for aerodrome lighting systems are \npublished in Annex 14  to the ICAO\
  \  Conventio n (Aerodrome Design and Operations , Volume 1 ), \n(ICAO, 2009) . \
  \ The lighting installations at Auckland were found to comply with Annex 14, \n\
  Volume 1 .  However, an anomaly was identified with the intensity settings for various\
  \ lights.    \n4.4.3.  Annex 14, Volume 1  defines t he type s of aerodrome light\
  \ fitting, the ir colour  and location , and \nthe spacing between fittings .  It\
  \ also  requires that the lighting intensity  be adjustable  to suit \nthe ambient\
  \ lighting conditions or pilot requests .  Guidance for setting the appropriate\
  \ lighting \nintensity to the ambient lighting conditions is provided by tables\
  \ and charts in the Aerodrome \nDesign Manual (ICAO, 2004)20 and ICAO recommend\
  \ s that similar guidance be provided to ai r \ntraffic controllers (ICAO, 2007\
  \ A, pp. 7 -21).     \n4.4.4.  Tower controller s can select five light intensity\
  \ steps for the runway lights and three for the \ntaxiway  lights , but these steps\
  \ are not associated with the intensities  that ICAO recommend s \nfor various ambient\
  \ lighting conditions .  The runway centreline and edge light intensities can \n\
  be set to OFF, 1%, 3%, 10% , 30% and 100% and the taxiway centreline lights to OFF,\
  \ 10%, \n                                                        \n20 See citations:\
  \ Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual aids, Doc 9157.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\
  \ report AO -2013 -006 30% and 100%.  Airways calibrate s the aerodrome lighting\
  \ circuits to match the percentage \nsteps that can be selected in the control tower.\
  \  However,  it does  not measure the light \nintensit ies emitted by various lights\
  \ at each adjustment step and relate those intensities to \nthe tower settings .\
  \  Airways advised that the most recent  calibration of this nature had been  \n\
  carried out in 1992  on the taxiway centreline lights .   \n4.4.5.  The type of\
  \  lamp , its wattage, the optical performance  and any  deterioration from age\
  \ or \nexternal contamination on the lens  are all factors that can affect  the\
  \ output light intensity  of a \nfitting .  The expected light output can be calculated\
  \ based on the input current and the \ncharacteristics of new lamps , but only measure\
  \ ment  can confirm the actual light output .  In-\nsitu measu rement is p articularly\
  \ relevant with fittings that are expected to have specific \noptical characteristics\
  \  and variable intensity settings  for aerodrome safety , such as taxiway \nand\
  \ runway lights .   \n4.4.6.  The Airways Manual of Air Traffic Services  requires\
  \ controllers to select 'appropriate \nintensities '  whenever the runway lighting\
  \ is in use.  The manual does not list what those \nappropriate settings might be\
  \ , although guidance is provided to controllers through on -the-job \ntraining.\
  \   \n4.4.7.  Tower control lers at Auckland had a  general practice of setting\
  \ the runway edge lights one \nintensity step above th at for th e runway centreline\
  \  lights,  with the intention that  the edge \nlights would  be brighter.  They\
  \ had no way of knowing whether the actual lighting int ensity or \nthe relative\
  \ intensities of the centreline  and edge lights  matched  the ICAO recommendations\
  \ . \n4.4.8.  At the time of this incident the tower controller had, i n accordance\
  \ with the general practice, \nset the taxiway centreline intensity to 10%, the\
  \ runway c entreline to 3% and the runway edge \nlights to 10%.  \n4.4.9.  Airways\
  \ calculated  the light intensities (measured in candela)21 for the incident settings,\
  \  using  \ninformation about the light fittings and the relationship between electrical\
  \ circuit current and \nlight output intensity.  Th ese values are  compared in\
  \ Table 1 with the ICAO Aerodrome Design \nManual 's guidance and recommended (shaded)\
  \ intensit ies for low ambient light conditions at \nnight . \nTable 1: Lighting\
  \ intensity  in candela  \n Taxiway  \ncentre line Runway \ncentre line Runway edge\
  \  Ratio of \ncentreline \nintensity to edge \nintensity  \nLight colour  Green\

  \ \nActual settings  6 177 1,333 1:7.5 \n4.4.10.  The ICAO  guidance on the  minimum\
  \ setting for taxiway centreline lights22 at night is 20 \ncandela .  If the background\
  \ is 'high brightness ' or if fog conditions exist, ICAO suggests  that \nthe intensity\
  \ be increased to 50 candela .  Neither high brightness nor fog conditions existed\
  \ at \n                                                        \n21 Candela is the\
  \ internationally recognised unit of luminous intensity in a given direction.  One\
  \ candela is \napproximately the light given out by a common candle.  \n22 ICAO\
  \ Aerodrome Design Manual Doc 9157 AN/901, section 4.6.6.  \nFinal report AO -2013\
  \ -006 \n<< Page 17 >>\n the time of this incident.  The actual intensity of the\
  \ taxiway centreline lights for this incident  \nwas set at six candela , 14 candela\
  \ less tha n the ICAO  minimum .   \n4.4.11.  The intensity of the runway centreline\
  \ lights was set well above  the recommended range23.  \nWith very low ambient light\
  \ conditions and good visibility, ICAO recommended  that the runway \ncentreline\
  \ lights be set  to between 10  and 20 candela.  However,  they were set brighter\
  \ at \n177 candela .  The recommended setting for the runway edge lights24 was 20-40\
  \ candela , but \nthe actual setting on the night was 1,333 candela . \n4.4.12.\
  \  Although t he intensities  of the taxiway lead -in lights and the runway centre\
  \ line and edge lights \nwere  not as  recommended  by ICAO , the runway edge lights\
  \ were brighter than the runway \ncentreline  lights , as required .  Adherence\
  \ to t he ICAO standards provides pilots anywhere in \nthe world with consistent\
  \ cues for ground manoeuvring, so a ny variance from the standard s \ncan contribute\
  \ to a pilot making an error.   The variances in lighting  seen at Auckland Airport\
  \ \nare a safety issue that the Commission is recommend ing that the chief executive\
  \ of Auckland \nAirport address.  \n4.4.13.  Auckland Airport is one of many certificated\
  \ aerodromes  in New Zealand that have different \nowners of the aerodrome itself\
  \ and  of the visual aids to navigation (including aerodrome  \nlighting).  It is\
  \ possible that variances in runway lighting, like those found at Auckland \nInternational\
  \ Airport, may also exist at other aerodromes .  Therefore the Commission is \n\
  recommending  that the Director of Civil Aviation, in conjunction with the chief\
  \ executive of \nAirways,  check that all certificated aerodromes comply in all\
  \ respects with the ICAO standards  \nfor aerodrome lighting .      \n4.5. The regulatory\
  \ framework  \n4.5.1.  The international requirements for aerodrome design and operation\
  \ are set out in Annex 14 , \nVolume 1 .  New Zealand has given effect to Annex\
  \ 14 , Volume 1 through Civil Aviation Rule  \n139.51 , Aerodrome design requirements\
  \ , and its associated advisory circular, AC139 -6, but \nthe means of thi s intent\
  \ is ambiguous . \n4.5.2.  Rule 139.51 state d at the time  that aerodromes must\
  \ have physical characteristics, visual \naids and equipment, including lighting,\
  \ commensurate with the needs of aircraft that will use \nthe aerodrome.  The advisory\
  \ circular  to the rule,  AC139 -6, says that compl iance  with the \nphysical characteristics,\
  \ the types of equipment , installations and the standards detailed in \nthe circular\
  \ is an  acceptable means of compl ying with Rule 139.51 . \n4.5.3.  New Zealand\
  \ is required by Article 38 of t he Convention to advise ICAO of any differences\
  \ \nbetween New Zealand's civil aviation requirements and the standards of ICAO.\
  \  The current list \nof differences25 states that the standards of Annex 14, Volume\
  \ 1  are met by compliance with \nAC139 -6.  \n4.5.4.  A review of the electronic\
  \ filing of differences between Annex 14, Volume 1  and AC139 -6 \nrevealed numerous\
  \ a dministrative errors in both the advisory circular and the filing of \ndifferences\
  \ between  the two documents. Examples included : stating that the Annex 14, \n\
  Volume 1 requirements for taxiway centreline lights were  met by the section in\
  \ the advisory \ncircular that dealt with  taxiway edge lights; and incorrect referencing\
  \  in the advisory circular to \nrelevant  Annex 14, Volume 1  appendices  that\
  \ define technical specifications for equipment .   \n4.5.5.  Since thi s incident\
  \ the CAA has made major changes  to Part 139. The revised rul e published \non\
  \ 1 August 2015 addressed  the potential ambiguity with aerodrome design requirements.\
  \  \nHowever, the CAA advis ed that the published versions of AC139 -6 and the electronic\
  \ filing of \ndifferences with Annex 14, Volume 1 will remain until the revision\
  \ of all 16 of its associated \nadvisory circulars has been completed.   \n    \
  \                                                    \n23 ICAO Doc 9157 AN/901,\
  \ table 5 -3. \n24 ICAO Doc 9157 AN/901, table 5 -3. \n25 As at 3 December 2015\
  \ this was: Sixth edition volume 1 - July 2013: Annex 14, Volume 1, Amendment 11.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -006 4.5.6.  AC139 -6 restate s many\
  \ of the relevant sections of Annex 14, Volume 1 , with the exception \nthat the\
  \  advisory circular uses the word 'should' wherever Annex 14, Volume 1  uses the\
  \ word \n'shall'.  The status of  ICAO Annex components and the organisation's editorial\
  \ practices are \ndescribed in the For eword to Ann ex 14, Volume 1. It states that\
  \ the  use of  the word 'shall' \nsignifies a standard that must be complied with,\
  \ and the word 'should'  signifies a \nrecommended practice.  This change in phraseology\
  \ by the CAA , away  from the ICAO \nconvention , enables the possibility of acceptable\
  \ means of compliance specified in the \nadvisory circular being  applied  in different\
  \ ways .  \n4.5.7.  The CAA says the use of the word 'shall' in an advisory circular\
  \ is not appropriate because  the \ncircular describe s only one means  of compliance\
  \ and other means may be acceptable.  The \nCAA's rationale is that unless the Director\
  \ accepts another means of compliance , the \nrequirements in the advisory circular\
  \ must be met.  Once selected, the acceptable means of \ncompliance must be adhere\
  \ d to fully.  However, the CAA's use of 'should' in advisory circulars \ncould\
  \ be  misleading, because one could infer  that full adherence to the chosen means\
  \ of \ncompliance is optional.   \n4.5.8.  In the interests of improved regulation\
  \ in the transport sector , the Com mission is \nrecommending that when revising\
  \  AC139 -6, or any other advisory circular, the Director of Civil \nAviation address\
  \ any ambiguity caused by advisory circulars using verbs that allow an ICAO \nstandard\
  \ requirement to be regarded as a recommended and no t a mandatory practice.  \n\
