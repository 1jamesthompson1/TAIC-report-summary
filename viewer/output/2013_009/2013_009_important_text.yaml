  \  \n4.1.1.  The RNZAF  has provided regular transport flights to  Antarctica since\
  \ 1965, as part of the  \naviation element in the joint United States - New Zealand\
  \ logistics pool.  The Boeing 757 was \nincluded  in the pool in 2010 after the\
  \ successful completion of two trial flights .  For the first \nthree years the\
  \ Boeing 757 was used primarily to return personnel from Antarctica at the end \n\
  of each season.  The incident flight was the second  of six pre-planned flights\
  \ from \nChristchurch to Pegasus Field  for the s eason  and the first tim e that\
  \ the Boeing 757  had been \nused at the start of the season.   \n4.1.2.  The weather\
  \ in A ntarctic a is known for its severity  and potential to change  rapidly .\
  \  Weather \nsystems move around the continent at pace and , partly because of its\
  \ isolation and lack of \nweather data, forecasting can be  challenging .  Storms\
  \ can form and dissipate with little or no \nwarning.  The use of remotely located\
  \ automatic weather stations, satellite imagery and \ncomputer modelling based on\
  \ historical information has resulted in a stea dy improvement in \nthe availability\
  \ and accuracy of weather information.  Nevertheless, properly trained and \nexperienced\
  \ staff are still required to validate the data and provide real -time information\
  \ to \npilots.     \n4.1.3.  On 7 October  2013  the forecast sent to the  crew\
  \ of the aeroplane  before they reached the \nPSR was derived from a range of data\
  \ sources and followed careful analysis by experienced \nforecasters.  However,\
  \ the expected clearance of the low cloud did not occur .  Instead , soon \nafter\
  \ passing the PSR the low-level cloud and fog that had been  some distance from\
  \ the \nairfield began to spread , quickly engulf ing the airfield . \n4.1.4.  The\
  \ following analysis discusses  the circumstances  around  the crew 's decision\
  \  to continue \npast the PSR, and what occurred  for the crew to  be left  with\
  \ no option other than to land at \nPegasus Field in near -whiteout  conditions.\
  \  In particular the analysis cover s the following \nareas:  \n1. preparation for\
  \ the flight  \n2. the decision to continue past the PSR \n3. the decision to descend\
  \ below the MDA and land  at Pegasus Field . \n4.1.5.  The analysis also discusses\
  \ t he risk of using the Boeing 757 for Antarctic operations , and in \nparticular\
  \ how changes in circumstances could affect the validity of the risk assessment\
  \ made \nin support of the original decision to use the Boeing 757 for Antar ctic\
  \ operations.  \n4.1.6.  A further issue  that did not contribute to the incident,\
  \ but is discussed, concern s the \nmanagement of airspace within the McMurdo Sector,\
  \ below 60\xBA south . \n4.2. Preparation for the flight  \n4.2.1.  The crew of\
  \ the aeroplane  undertook the normal pre -deployment training, which included \n\
  learning about Antarctic weather and flight planning considerations.  A weather\
  \ forecaster with \nmore than  five years of Antarctic forecasting experience also\
  \ participated in the training.  The \nRNZAF had review ed past Antarctic operations\
  \ and applied the lessons learned to its \noperations plan. T he captain had practi\
  \ sed the whiteout  landing technique in a simulator .  The \ncrew had therefore\
  \ been prepared as far as possible for the forthcoming flight s and were well \n\
  aware of the risks associated with the operation.  Collectively , the flight crew\
  \ was well trained \nand experienced for Antar ctic flights.  \n4.2.2.  The three\
  \ flights planned for the early part of the season were primarily to carry personnel.\
  \  \nThe first  flight on 3 October 2013 went as planned.  The good weather conditions\
  \ at Pegasus \nField allowed the crew to re -familiarise themselves with the airfield\
  \ layout .  The observing pilot \ntook the opportunity to take photographs during\
  \ the approach , which proved useful when \nplanning for the final approach in near\
  \ -whiteout  conditions . \n \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -009 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.2.3.\
  \  The crew also took the opportunity to assess  the accuracy of the aeroplane's\
  \ navigation \nequipment and instrument approach data.  This suggested to the  crew\
  \  that the final appro ach \ntrack was some 15 m  to the left of the centreline\
  \ of the runway.  This information also proved \nuseful when faced with landing\
  \ in near -whiteout  conditions.  \n4.2.4.  With a normal  runway width of 200 feet,\
  \ the 15 m or 45 -foot offset was a n issue that \nincreased th e risk of operations\
  \ into the a erodrome.  The instrument approaches , while still \ncurrent,  were\
  \ scheduled for revalidation within the following  three  weeks .  This issue is\
  \ \ndiscussed later in the analysis when considering the changes in operational\
  \ plans potentially \naffecting the initial risk assessment.  \n4.2.5.  The flight\
  \ was delayed for two days because of adverse weather condit ions at McMurdo.  The\
  \ \ndecision s on those occasions not to launch and continue as far as the PSR were\
  \  joint \ndecision s by the authorising officer and the captain.  Weather delays\
  \ were not uncommon and \nwere accepted as part of normal Antarctic operations.\
  \  \n4.2.6.  The passenger list for the flight south included a group of very important\
  \ persons (VIPs).  There \nwas no evidence to suggest that the decis ion-making\
  \ by the crew was influenced by the \npresence of this group or the two -day delay\
  \ because of the weather conditions at McMurdo.  \nThe crew was experienced in dealing\
  \ with VIPs and were trained to prioritise the safety of the \naeroplane.   \n4.2.7.\
  \  The conditio ns on 7 October 2013 met the launch criteria and were considered\
  \ by the crew \nand authorising officer to be very similar to th ose for th e first\
  \ flight four days previously.  The \nweather systems had moved through and the\
  \ forecast and briefing by the SOPP for ecaster \nwere  for improving conditions.\
  \  Nevertheless, the crew delayed the departure to obtain further  \ninformation\
  \ .  Only after receiving an updated forecast  and additional  observations, having\
  \ a \nsecond  briefing with the SOPP  staff  and getting confirmation from the crew\
  \ of the Hercules \ndeparting Pegasus Field that the weather was improving, did\
  \ the crew and authorising officer \nagree  that it was suitable to depart Christchurch.\
  \  \n4.2.8.  The decision to depart Christchurch was well considered and appropriate\
  \ based on  the \ninformation  that the RNZAF had received prior to the flight being\
  \ authorised.  \nFindings  \n1. The crew was well prepared and sufficiently experienced\
  \ for the flight . \n2. The decision for the aeroplane to depart Christchurch was\
  \ w ell considered and \nappropriate based on the information that the RNZAF had\
  \ received prior to the flight \nbeing authorised.  \n4.3. The decision to continue\
  \ past the point of safe return (PSR)  \n4.3.1.  The crew obtained regular weather\
  \ updates, including observations and forecasts, as the flight \nprogressed south.\
  \  The crew also requested 30 -minute observations  rather than  the normal \nhourly\
  \ report s.  The ea rly reports of f og in the distance caused the crew s ome initial\
  \ concern , \nso they contacted the SOPP staff at McMurdo and in Charleston  to\
  \ question this.  The  crew \nwas told that the conditions were not unusual and\
  \  the fog would remain clear of the airfield.  \nAfter receiving the forecast \
  \ prior to reaching the PSR, the crew  again  contacted both  the SOPP \nfacilities\
  \ and was again told that the conditions would improve . \n4.3.2.  The forecast\
  \ prior to PSR was for conditions better than the squadron's  criteria  for continuing\
  \ \nto Pegasus Field .  The forecast predicted  scattered  cloud at 300 feet, 3,000\
  \ feet and 8,000 \nfeet.  The minimum allowable was broken  cloud at 2,000 feet.\
  \   The forecast was for \nunrestricted visibility with the wind well below the\
  \ 20 -knot limit.  The forecast wind direction \nwas from the grid west , off the\
  \ Ross Island glaciers .  According to the meteorologists ' guiding \n\n<< Page\
  \ 22 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -009 information , the likely trend with the wind\
  \ blowing from that direction should have been for \nany low cloud  to dissipate\
  \ .  \n4.3.3.  The two observations leading up to the PSR forecast reported t he\
  \ surface wind swinging from \nthe north -west around to the south.  However, the\
  \ wind continued to change direction, moving \nto the east before becoming calm.\
  \  With the wind strength being so light, it may not have had \nthe anticipated\
  \ clearing effect, and th e fog was able to form  quickly  over the airfield . \n\
  4.3.4.  The observations  prior  to the issuing of the PSR forecast varied but were\
  \ all above the \nminimum criteria to continue and, with the exception of the reported\
  \ fog in the distance, \ntrended towards an improveme nt in the conditions.   The\
  \ crew called both the SOPP facilities \nand asked about the fog.  Again they were\
  \ r eassured  that it was not a factor and they could \nexpect good conditions on\
  \ arrival.  The airfield surface and horizon definitions continued to be \nbetter\
  \ than the PSR criteria at good  and good  respectively . \n4.3.5.  The criteria\
  \ to continue past PSR -2d included  a minimum cloud base  only; that is, broken\
  \ or \novercast cloud.   There was no allowance in the criteria for few or scattered\
  \  cloud or fog below \nthis level.  This issue is discussed later in the analysis\
  \ when considering the changes in \noperational plans potentially affecting the\
  \ initial risk assessment  \n4.3.6.  No reason could be found for the special weather\
  \ report issued at 1225 , part of the normal \n30-minute cycle of reports,  not\
  \ being forwarded to the crew of the aeroplane .  The crew had \nrequested a special\
  \ forecast (PSR forecast) because they were about to make a decision on \nwhether\
  \ to continue past the PSR.  This PSR forecast  was received some nine minutes before\
  \ \nthe 1225 special report was issued.   A quick review of the crew's weather log\
  \ should have \ndetected the missing report. The crew may therefore not have realised\
  \  that the 1225 report \nhad not arrived , or been unconcerned  about not receiving\
  \ it.  If the y were concerned they \ncould have specifically requested the report.\
  \    \n4.3.7.  The absence of the 1225 report  would have been  unlikely to  alter\
  \ the actions of the crew \nbecause it contained information similar to that  in\
  \ the following  weather report issued at \n1255 .  The 1255 report was received\
  \ by the crew some 13 minutes after passing the first PSR \n(PSR-2d).  When the\
  \ crew received it, they were reassured by the SOPP McMurdo facility  that \nthe\
  \ fog remained in the distance  and made the decision to continue.  At that time\
  \  the \naeroplane still had about 25 minutes to run to the second  PSR (PSR-alt).\
  \  The crew therefore \nstill had the option of returning to Christchurch or diverting\
  \ to Dunedin - albeit  that a safe  \nreturn would have to have been at normal cruise\
  \ altitude . \n4.3.8.  The special  report issued at 1332  was not received by the\
  \ crew until 1345 .  This was the first \nreport that indicated to the crew that\
  \ conditions had deteriorated.  Again , no explanation was \ngiven for th e unusually\
  \  long time  taken in forwarding  the report to the aeroplane .  Having \nalready\
  \ passed PSR -alt at about 1325 , the crew  was now committed to landing in Antarctica.\
  \   \nNevertheless, it is unusual that special weather observations and forecasts\
  \ were either not \nsent or , as in this case, took a  significantly longer period\
  \ of t ime than usual to be delivered .  \nThe various agencies  directly involved\
  \ w ere aware that the aeroplane was near to the critical \ndecision point, and\
  \ that the weather conditions were essential  to the crew making that \ndecision.\
  \  See safety actions at section  7. \n  \n \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -009 \n<<\
  \ Page 23 >>\n Findings  \n3. Based on the available weather information and the\
  \ reassurance s by the United \nStates Navy's Office of Polar Programs ' forecasters\
  \ in Charleston  and McMurdo , the \ncrew was justified in continuing  past the\
  \ point of safe return . \n4. The absence of the 1225 special weather report and\
  \ the delay in sending the 1332 \nspecial weather report, while unlikely to have\
  \ altered the outcome, need to be \nexamined further to ensure that safet y-critical\
  \ information is passed to crews in a \ntimely manner.   \n \n4.4. Descent below\
  \ minimum descent altitude  (MDA)  \n4.4.1.  The crew, having passed the PSR , was\
  \ left with no option other than to land in Antarctica , \nregardless of the weather\
  \ .  A diversion to either Wilkins or Union Glacier  might have \ntheoretically\
  \ been  possible , but it was not viable, safe or practicable  for the following\
  \ reasons:  \n1. the crew did not have any weather information for either o f the\
  \ airfields  \n2. they did not have  information  on the winds for the routes to\
  \ either destination  \n3. they were not familiar with either location  \n4. they\
  \ did not have any information on the runways or whether  instrument approaches\
  \  \nwere available .  Because of the long distances involved, a ny decision to\
  \ divert  would have \nneeded to be made early and would have precluded  the option\
  \ of holding in the McMurdo \nSound area , possibly for two or three hours , waiting\
  \ for the weather to improve.  \n4.4.2.  The crew  raised the MDA for the first\
  \ approach by 50 feet to 410 feet to all ow for the \ndisplaced threshold and in\
  \ an attempt to provide a constant descent path through to \ntouchdown.  Leaving\
  \ the MDA  at the standard  360 feet would have increase d the possibility of \n\
  sighting the runway  on the first landing attempt .  The final portion of the approach\
  \ path could \nthen have been adapted to ensure the landing was at least 1,000 feet\
  \ along the runway.  \nHowever, at 360 feet it was unlikely  that the crew would\
  \  have sighted the runway  anyway.  The \nTwin Otter  that attempted to land after\
  \ the Boeing 757 aeroplane was using the 360 -foot MDA  \nand still  had to overshoot\
  \ .  And when the aeroplane descended to 100 feet on its second \nattempt to land\
  \ , the crew still could not see anything until after the missed approach \nprocedure\
  \ was c ommenced.  \n4.4.3.  The crew considered each of the other landing sites\
  \ around McMurdo Sound , and agreed that \nPegasus Field was the most suitable .\
  \  The MDA  for the runway 15 RNAV instrument approach \nwas lower than that for\
  \ runway 33 and the outer runway approach area was clear of \nobstruction s.  However,\
  \ the entire ru nway , including the intermediate approach area,  was also \nobscured\
  \ by the fog  and there were no approach or runway -end identification lights to\
  \ lead the \ncrew on  to the runway.  Further, the crew was not familiar with this\
  \ runway and the approach \nwould have been  towards the airfield building s and\
  \ fuel storage area .  Runway 33 was \ntherefore considered the safest and best\
  \ option.   \n4.4.4.  An MDA  for an instrument approach is set to  provide a safety\
  \ margin above kn own obstacles  \nduring an instrument approach .  Normally a \
  \ pilot can descend below a MDA  only when they \nhave the required visual references\
  \ to help ensure a sa fe landing.  In this case the crew had \nno option other than\
  \ to de scend below the minima. They were not expecting the weather to \nclear until\
  \ after the aeroplane  had exhausted its  fuel and there was no other safe alternat\
  \ ive \naerodrome where they could  land.  \n4.4.5.  All that the crew could do\
  \ was to mitigate the risks.  In some res pects the RNZAF had begun \nthat process\
  \ before the flight depa rted Christchurch.  The captain being able to practi se\
  \ \nlanding in near -whiteout  conditions in a simulator would have been one such\
  \ measure.  The \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -009 crew  used their\
  \ experience and  familiarity with th e approach and airfield  to good effect .\
  \  They \nknew the location s and height s of the obstacles and were confident in\
  \ the accuracy of the \naeroplane's navigation equipment.  The second  approach\
  \ confirm ed the accuracy of the \ninstrument approach compared with the approach\
  \ of four days earlier and gave them \nconfidence that they could continue the descent\
  \ and have a good chance of making a near -\nwhiteout  landing  on the runway .\
  \ \n4.4.6.  They also took measures to reduce the consequences of an unsuccessful\
  \ landing by briefing  \nthe emergency services and preparing the aeroplane cabin\
  \ for such an eventuality.  The \ndecision was the best one that any captain could\
  \ have made  faced with similar circumstances.  \n4.4.7.  The captain used the resources\
  \ available to him to help ensure he had as much information \nas possible on which\
  \ to make his decisions.  This incident provides a good example of a crew \nperforming\
  \ in a cohesive manner .  The successful landing was the result of an experienced\
  \ \ncrew performing well as a team and is a good e xample of crew resource management.\
  \   \nFindings  \n5. The RNAV approach to runway 33 at Pegasus Field was the best\
  \ option for a \nsuccessful landing.  \n6. The decision to fly to a lower minimum\
  \ descent  altitude was the only reasonable \noption available to the crew in order\
  \ to make a successful landing . \n7. The incident was a good demonstration of effective\
  \ crew  resource management that \nenabled a safe landing to be made in demanding\
  \ circumstances.   \n \n4.5. The risk of using the Boeing 757 for Antarctic operations\
  \  \n4.5.1.  The fundamental safety issue arising  from  this incident  was not\
  \ the decisions by the crew to \npass the PSR and de scend the aeroplane below the\
  \ MDA  in order to make a successful \nlanding.  The issue and question is why the\
  \ aeroplane ended up in that position  when the crew \nhad followed standard operating\
  \ procedures.  \n4.5.2.  The use of the Boeing 757 -2K2 for Antarctic flights was\
  \ subject to an extensive evaluation \nprocess before a supplementary type certificate\
  \ was issued giving approval for Antarctic \noperati ons.  As part of that process\
  \ a risk assessment was conducted.   The d eterioration of \nthe weather after the\
  \ aeroplane had gone past the PSR was listed as a \"possible\" risk.  In \napplying\
  \ the risk treatment process the chances of this occurring we re reduced  to \"\
  unlikely\".  \nThe risk mitigation was achieved by applying  the same PSR weather\
  \ criteria  used by the \nHercules, and applying  the notion  that when the  Boeing\
  \ 757 reached its PSR it was one hour \ncloser to its destination when compared\
  \ with the Hercules  aeroplane .  On the grounds that \nthere was one hour less\
  \ for the weather to deteriorate before arrival , the risk  was considered \nto\
  \ be  \"significantly less\".  The same principle used in the original type certificate\
  \ risk \nassessment also filtered down to the risk  assessment for each individual\
  \ flight.  This was a \nreasonable assumption, although it needed to be tempered\
  \ with the knowledge that when \nlocalised weather conditions in Antarctica deteriorate,\
  \ they can do so quickly , as happened in \nthis case . \n4.5.3.  History show ed\
  \ that the weather had deteriorated to or below approach minima after an \naeroplane\
  \ passed the PSR on only two occasion s out of 650 Antarctica flights in 48 years.\
  \  \nThe likelihood of this occurring was therefore reasonably low.  What was missing\
  \  from the r isk \nassessment were  the potential end consequence s of an event\
  \ such as this occu rring when \nusing the Boeing 757 , compared with those  when\
  \ using  the Hercules aircraft.  The \nconsequence of not being able to complete\
  \ a visual or instrument approach successfull y was \nthe same for both aircraft\
  \ - a whiteout landing.  However, in the event of this occurring the \nlikelihood\
  \ of injury was significantly greater for the Boeing 757 , with its long landing\
  \ gear \n \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -009 \n<< Page 25 >>\n supporting low-slung\
  \ engines on a low wing , than it was for  the Hercules  with its rough -field \n\
  landing capabilities .  \n4.5.4.  Compared with the Hercules , the Boeing 757 had\
  \  limited alternative approach options or \naerodromes available in the event of\
  \ the weather suddenly deteriorating below instrument \napproach minima .  The Hercules\
  \ was fitted with a tactical air navigation system, commonly \ncalled TACAN, enabling\
  \ it to fly a range of additional  instrument approaches to the various \nairfields\
  \ and runways.  The Hercules could divert to Terra Nova Bay, subject to weather\
  \ \ncond itions.  As a final resort it could also land either at Williams Field\
  \ or in the whiteout  area , \nalbeit sustain ing damage .  The only option noted\
  \ in the risk profile for the Boeing was a \"blind \" \nlanding off an instrument\
  \ approach.   From a risk perspective t hen, the likelihood of the \nweather closing\
  \ in was low, but the potential consequences for Boeing 757 operations were  \n\
  significantly more serious  than were those for  the Hercules aircraft.  \n4.5.5.\
  \  The two trial flights had been  flown in December and February and , until 2013\
  \ , all subsequent \nBoeing flights had been  flown towards the end of the season\
  \ , in either February or March.  The \nrisk evaluation process made no reference\
  \ to the time of year in which the flights were to be \nflown .  Meteorological\
  \ advice on the su bject varied .  With the sea ice extending well to the \n(true)\
  \ north at the beginning of the summer season, meteorologist s thought that there\
  \ was \nunlikely to be the same level of relative humidity to help generate fog\
  \ as there would be late in \nthe season.    \n4.5.6.  By contrast, NIWA found that\
  \ \"there is a marked deterioration in average weather conditions \noutside of the\
  \ period November -February\".30 The table below shows weather trend data \nprovided\

  \ Station and Scott Base, where the \ndata was collected, and the various airfields\
  \ between 5 and 30 kilometres away . \n32 Nautical miles.  \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Final\

  \         (1.9 km)  12 5.5 2.5 2 2 0 5.5 \n  \n4.5.7.  The formation of fog around\
  \ Ross Island was often associated with a depression or low \ncentred near Cape\
  \ Adare that pulled moist air down into McMurdo Sound.  The meteorological \nexperts\
  \  consulted  agreed  that given the prevailing  conditions present  on 7 October\
  \ 2013 , it \nwould have been  reasonable to assume that a ny early -morning fog\
  \ and low cloud would  \ndissipate  with the advanc ing high pressure . \n4.5.8.\
  \  A second consideration with undertaking flights early in the season was the adequacy\
  \ of the \nprovision of weather information for flight crews .  Other than those\
  \ personnel wintering over, \nweather forecasters and observers deploy ed south\
  \ with the first few flights.  This mean t that \nuntil all posts were  filled,\
  \ services had to  be tailored around the requirements of each flight.  \nThis was\
  \ an unavoidable situation  and one recognised by t he crew of the aeroplane , who\
  \ \ndelay ed their departure from Christchurch to obtain additional  observations\
  \ and to \ncommunicate with the crew of the returning Hercules .  The crew was also\
  \ able to talk directly \nto both the SOPP Charleston and McMurdo weather office\
  \ s and d iscuss the various \nobservations and forecasts.  \n4.5.9.  A third consideration\
  \ was the validity and accuracy of the instrument approaches .  Some \ninaccurac\
  \ ies resulting from  equipment limitations and satellite signal strength in the\
  \ Antarctic  \ncan be expected .  However, with the use of augmented systems33,\
  \ errors of less than three \nmetres are not unrealistic .  The approximately 15-metre\
  \ offset between the approach track \nand runway centreline identified by the crew\
  \ of the aeroplane  was a further risk to the safety \nof aircraft using the runway\
  \ .  The likely reason for the offset was  that the ice sheet upon which \nthe aerodrome\
  \ was located had moved during  the winter season .  This w as predictable.  \n\
  4.5.10.  The instrument approaches were  re-calibrated  annually  in mid to late\
  \ Oct ober , before the level \nof aviation activity increased  significantly in\
  \ support of summer programmes, camps and other \nstations.  The re-calibration\
  \  checks were  valid for one year and  could  only commence  once the \nfirst suitable\
  \ airfield ha d opened .  Thus the re-calibration flights  could  only follow the\
  \ initial \ndeployment  flights . On 7 October 2013 the RNAV instrument approach\
  \ to runway 33 was still \nwithin its validation period.     \n4.5.11.  During better\
  \ meteorological conditions , the 360 -foot minimum descent altitu de would \nnormally\
  \ be reached a t a point a bout two kilometres  from the runway.34  This should\
  \ give \nsufficient time for a pilot to manoeuvre and position an aircraft towards\
  \ the centre of the \nrunway  for a safe landing .  In the near -whiteout  conditions\
  \ experienced by the crew of the \naeroplane on this occasion , however, the first\
  \ indication that a pilot would have that the \nrunway centreline was offset would\
  \ be as he was flaring the aeroplane to land.   The offset \nrunway was another\
  \ factor that increased the risk of Antarctic flight operations early in the \n\
  season, before re-calibration flights could take place.  \n4.5.12.  The PSR forecast\
  \ criteria  that the crew used to help them make the decision to continue past \n\
  the PSR has provide d good guidance in the pa st.  One exception involved an  RNZAF\
  \ Hercules \n                                                        \n33 For example\

  \ >>\n in 1993 , which was the result of inaccurate forecasting.35  In a second\
  \ incident  involving \nrapidly deteriorating conditions in 2002, a Hercules was\
  \ still able to land off the normal \ninstrument approach, although  it required\
  \ two attempts.  The standard of forecasting has since \nimproved but , as shown\
  \ in this incident, even with the best of resources available , localised \nweather\
  \ in Antarctic a can still prove difficult to predict accurately.  \n4.5.13.  The\
  \ Boeing 757 and Hercule s36 are two large aircraft operating between New Zealand\
  \ and \nAntarctica that require PSR s.  The New York  Air National  Guard Hercules\
  \  aeroplanes  are ski \nequipped and ha ve the option of diverting to unprepared\
  \ areas if required.  The Austr alian-\nmodified civil  Airbus A31937 does not normally\
  \ operate with a PSR unless it is heavily loaded.  \nThe United States C17 Globemaster\
  \ usually has  a PSR some 20 -30 minutes out from landing \nat McMurdo.   This equates\
  \ to about the start of the des cent for landing.  For the C17 \nGlobemaster to\
  \ continue past the PSR, it requires a minimum 1 ,500-foot cloud base and \nvisibility\
  \ of 4,800 m.  \n4.5.14.  The crew used the PSR weather criteria in deciding whether\
  \ to proceed past PSR-2d, which \nmade no allowance for the presence of cloud (few\
  \ or scattered ) or fog below a 2 ,000-foot \ncloud base ( broken  or overcast ).\
  \  When assessing the risk, the presence of low cloud and fog \nnear the aerodrome,\
  \ regardless if forecast  to dissipate, still needs to be considered.  This is \n\
  even more essential when opera ting earl y in the summer season when the NIWA data\
  \ shows \nan increased risk of fog forming.  \n4.5.15.  Finally, developments in\
  \ Antarctica might mean that there are other destinations that a Boeing \n757 could\
  \ use in the event of the weather conditions deteriorat ing below minima after an\
  \ \naeroplane has passed the PSR.  These possibilities should be investigated and\
  \ considered \nwhen reviewing the risk assessment for Antarctica flights.  \nFindings\

  \ ome \ndeteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return\
  \ .  \nHowever, the potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the\
  \ \nBoeing 757 aircraft, because of the lack of alternative approach procedures\
  \  and \naerodromes suitable f or this aircraft type.  \n9. There are four factors\

  \ New Zealand ICAO allocated airspace  \n4.6.1.  When considering wider aspects\
  \ of its inquiry into this incident, the Commission noted an \napparent anomaly\
  \ in the management of the airspace known as the McMurdo Sector.  The \nanom aly\
  \ did not contribute in any way to the incident.  \n4.6.2.  The so -called \"McMurdo\
  \ Sector \" was part of the Auckland  Oceanic  flight information region, \nwhich\
  \ is airspace allocated to New Zealand by ICAO.  In accordance with  ICAO  requirements\
  \ \nand the New Zealand Civil Aviation Act 199038, New Zealand 's civil aviation\
  \ rules require tha t \nair traffic services and certain meteorological information\
  \  can only be provided within the flight \ninformation region by organisations\
  \ certificated under New Zealand civil aviation  rules.    \n4.6.3.  Under a letter\
  \ of agreement, responsibility for the provision of  air traffic services for aircraft\
  \ \n(military and civilian) operating within  the McMurdo Sector was passed from\
  \ Airways to the \nJoint Task Force whenever the sector was activated by NOTAM.\
  \  Absent from the agreement \nwas any involvement by the Director of Civ il Aviation\
  \ , who was the only person  who had the \nauthority to permit a sub-delegation\
  \ of responsibility for the provision of services for this \nairspace.   The Meteorological\
  \ Service of  New Zealand  was still to provide upper -level weather \ninformation\
  \ , for example upper -level winds or forecast s of severe turbulence.  The Joint\
  \ Task \nForce, through the SOPP, would provide routine aerodrome weather reports\
  \ and forecasts.   \n4.6.4.  In a 2006 ICAO audit of the New Zealand civil aviation\
  \ system , a finding was made r elating to \nthe provision of air navigation service\
  \ s for the McMurdo Sector  (ICAO 2006) .  The finding \nstated:  \nIn order to\
  \ facilitate Antarctic operations, a substantive portion of the southern part \n\
  of Auckland Oceanic FIR [flight information region] is rel ease[d] to an alternative\
  \ ATS \n[air traffic service] (McMurdo) under the terms of a letter of agreement\
  \ between \nACNZ [Airways Corporation of New Zealand] and McMurdo ATS.  However,\
  \ the CAA \ndoes not have a mechanism in place to ensure compliance by McMurdo A\
  \ TS with \nAnnex 1139 and th e CAA does not conduct effective regulatory oversight\
  \ over \nMcMurdo ATS.40 \n4.6.5.  In response to that finding the CAA stated:  \n\
  The finding is accepted.  New Zealand will enter into high level agreement with\
  \ the \nAgency providing air traffic services in the Mc Murdo Sector to ensure that\
  \ such \nservices are provided in accordance with Annex 11 and to an equivalent\
  \ standard as \nthat provided by New Zealand Civil Aviation Rules.  \nThe estimated\
  \ comp letion  date for the proposed corrective actions was July 2007.   See safety\
  \ \nactions, paragraph 7.2. 7. \n \n \n                                        \

  29 \n 5. Findings  \n5.1. The crew was well prepared and sufficiently experienced\
  \ for the flight.  \n5.2. The decision for the aeroplane to depart Christchurch\
  \ was well  considered and appropriate \nbased on  the information  that the RNZAF\
  \ had received prior to the flight being authorised.  \n5.3. Based on the available\
  \ weather information and the reassurances by the United States Navy's \nOffice\
  \ of Polar Programs ' forecasters in Charleston  and McMurdo , the crew was justifi\
  \ ed in \ncontinuing past the point of safe return.  \n5.4. The absence of the 1225\
  \ special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 special \nweather report,\
  \ while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be examined further to \n\
  ensure that safety -critical information is passed to crews in a timely manner.\
  \  \n5.5. The RNAV approach to runway 33 at Pegasus Field was the best option for\
  \ a successful \nlanding.  \n5.6. The decision to fly to a lower minimum descent\
  \  altitude was the only reasonable option \navailable to the crew in order to make\
  \ a successful landing.  \n5.7. The incident was a good demonstration of effective\
  \ crew resource management that enabled \na safe landing to be made in demanding\
  \ circumstances.  \n5.8. There was a  low likelihood of the weather conditions at\
  \ the Pegasus Field aerodrome \ndeteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed\
  \ the point of safe return.  However, the \npotential consequences of that happening\
  \ were elevated for the Boeing 757 aircraft, becaus e \nof the lack of alternative\
  \ approach procedures  and aerodromes suitable for this aircraft type.  \n5.9. There\
  \ are four factors that were not, but should have  been, considered when assessing\
  \ the \nrisk of using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic operations:  \n\uF0B7\
