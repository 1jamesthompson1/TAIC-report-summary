- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue or overwork contributing to the incident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident (section.4.2.1-section.4.2.8).

    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: 'The crew made decisions based on weather forecasts and reassurances from forecasters, which turned out to be incorrect as the weather deteriorated unexpectedly. This indicates a reliance on assumptions about weather behavior that contributed to the incident ("the forecast sent to the crew of the aeroplane before they reached the PSR was derived from a range of data sources and followed careful analysis by experienced forecasters. However, the expected clearance of the low cloud did not occur" (section.4.1.3)).

    '
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'The crew was well-prepared and sufficiently experienced for Antarctic flights, which suggests that training and competency were not significant contributing factors to the incident. However, the document mentions the importance of training for whiteout conditions, which played a role in the safe landing despite the unexpected weather ("The captain had practised the whiteout landing technique in a simulator" (section.4.2.1)).

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The crew was familiar with the equipment and had assessed the accuracy of the airplane''s navigation equipment, which suggests that this theme did not contribute to the incident ("The crew also took the opportunity to assess the accuracy of the aeroplane''s navigation equipment" (section.4.2.3)).

    '
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'The crew demonstrated effective crew resource management, which contributed to the safe outcome despite the challenging conditions. This theme is mentioned as a positive factor rather than a contributing factor to the incident ("The incident was a good demonstration of effective crew resource management" (section.4.4.7)).

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'The crew followed standard operating procedures and made decisions based on the weather information received. The adherence to safety procedures was not a contributing factor to the incident, but rather ensured that the crew was prepared for the flight conditions ("The decision to depart Christchurch was well considered and appropriate based on the information that the RNZAF had received prior to the flight being authorised" (section.4.2.8)).

    '
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that the organizational safety culture of the RNZAF was a contributing factor to the incident. The report does not discuss any issues related to the values, beliefs, or behaviors within the organization that could have influenced the outcome (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 20
  explanation: 'The risk assessment process did not fully account for the possibility of weather deteriorating below minima after passing the PSR, especially early in the summer season. This oversight in risk management contributed to the incident ("There was a low likelihood of the weather conditions at Pegasus Field aerodrome deteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return. However, the potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the Boeing 757 aircraft" (section.4.5.8, section.4.5.14)).

    '
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not indicate that a lack of regulatory oversight or non-compliance with regulations contributed to the incident. The RNZAF''s operations were conducted within the regulatory framework (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: 'The crew''s situational awareness was challenged by the rapidly changing weather conditions, which they did not anticipate. This lack of situational awareness regarding the actual weather at the destination contributed to the incident ("the forecast prior to PSR was for conditions better than the squadron''s criteria for continuing to Pegasus Field" (section.4.3.2)).

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The crew was prepared for an emergency landing, which suggests that emergency response preparedness was not a contributing factor to the incident but rather a mitigating factor ("They also took measures to reduce the consequences of an unsuccessful landing by briefing the emergency services and preparing the aeroplane cabin for such an eventuality" (section.4.4.6)).

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of equipment failure or maintenance issues contributing to the incident. The report indicates that the aircraft and its navigation equipment were functioning correctly (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not discuss the use of automation as a contributing factor to the incident. The decisions made were based on human judgment and weather forecasts (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 40
  explanation: 'Weather conditions played a critical role in the incident, as the unexpected deterioration in weather after passing the PSR led to the crew having to land in near-whiteout conditions. Decision making based on weather forecasts that did not materialize as expected was a significant contributing factor ("However, the expected clearance of the low cloud did not occur" (section.4.1.3)).

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'While there were delays in receiving weather reports, the report suggests that these delays were unlikely to have altered the outcome. Therefore, communication breakdown was not a significant contributing factor to the incident ("The absence of the 1225 special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 special weather report, while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be examined further" (section.4.3.6, section.4.3.7)).
