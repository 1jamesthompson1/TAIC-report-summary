The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry  and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring in to maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and co -ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas.  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the  occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commi ssion carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At 0957 on 7 October 2013, a Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757 departed 
Christchurch for Pegasus Field aerodrome in Antarctica.  There were 117 passengers and 13 
crew on board.  The passengers included a New Zealand Government Minister, staff from the  
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade , and staff from Antarctica New Zealand and the United 
States Antarctic Program.  
1.2. The flight departure had been delayed while the flight crew gathered additional information on 
the forecast weather conditions at Pegasus  Field.  The Boeing 757 aircraft did not have 
sufficient fuel capacity to complete the return trip without refuelling at Pegasus Field.  
1.3. A point of safe return had been pre -calculated.  The aeroplane would only continue past this 
point if the weather condit ions at Pegasus Field met certain criteria that would allow the 
aeroplane to land safe ly; otherwise it would return to Christchurch.  
1.4. The crew received regular and additional weather observations and forecasts from staff at the 
United States Navy's Space an d Naval Warfare Systems Command's Office of Polar Programs 
facilities at McMurdo and in Charl eston, USA.  Weather observers at Peg asus Field were noting 
the existence of a fog bank about five kilometres  from the runway.  The crew received 
assurances from the forecasters that the weather was forecast to improve.  Based on these 
assurances  and using the crew  member s' collective experience , both recent and from 
previous seasons, the crew made the decision t o continue past the point of safe return 
towards Pegasus Field.  About 20 minutes thereafter, the crew received the first of several 
weather observations that conditions had deteriorated and that a fog bank had enveloped the 
runway and its approaches.  
1.5. With  insufficient fuel on board to return to Christchurch, the crew was committed to continuing 
to Pegasus Field.  There was no other safe alternative aerodrome in Antarctica where the 
aeroplane could land.  The crew  made two attempts to land at Pegasus Field but the restricted 
visibility prevented the m gaining the required visual reference with the runway markings and 
lights.  After the first attempt the crew decided to hold to see if the weather would start to 
clear.  After holding for nearly two hours with n o improvement in the conditions , the crew 
decided to make a second approach  using a lower "minimum descent altitude" than the 
published minima in an attempt to increase the chance of becoming visual with the runway.  A  
member of the flight crew caught a gl impse of runway markings just as the approach was 
aborted and a missed approach procedure was initiated ( a "go-around "). 
1.6. With dwindling fuel reserves and conditions deteriorating the crew elected to make a third 
attempt at landing.  They again used the lower  "minimum de scent altitude ".  When the 
aeroplane reached about 110 feet above the runway , the crew saw the runway approach 
lights and markings and was able to make a successful landing in near -whiteout conditions.  
There was no damage to the aeroplan e and no -one was injured.  
1.7. The Commission f ound  that the observed and forecast weather conditions as reported to the 
crew met the criteria for the crew to continue past the point of safe return.  It also found that, 
given no safe alternative, the actions of  the crew in proceeding below the allowable minima for 
the aerodrome were appropriate, and that the crew had taken all reasonable precautions to 
mitigate the risk s involved in doing so.  
1.8. However, t he Commission f ound  that the risk assessment undertaken when considering the 
suitability of the Boeing 757 aircraft type for Antarctic operations had not adequately taken 
into consideration  five key points : 
 the potential consequences of the weather deteriorating were elevate d for the Boeing 757 
aircraft because of the lack of alternative approach procedures  and aerodromes suitable 
for the aircraft type  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009  the weather criteria for an aeroplane passing the point of safe return should consider the 
presence of low cloud and fog below the  main cloud base as a limiting factor  
 there  is an increased likelihood of weather conditions deteriorating below minima early in 
the summer season  
 the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated with caution prior to re-
calibration flights being co nducted early in the summer season  
 the Royal New Zealand Air Force  Boeing aircraft is capable of completing only one type of 
instrument approach in Antarctica .2 
1.9. The Commission recommended that the Chief of Air Force review the risk assessment for 
using the  Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic flight operations, taking into account these matters 
and any other matters not considered during the initial risk assessment.      
1.10.  The key lessons  learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence were:  
 Effective crew resource management enables a crew to perform as a cohesive unit and 
provides the best opportunity for a safe outcome.  This incident demonstrates how a 
properly trained crew was able to function effectively in demanding circumstances and 
make a safe landing.  
 An es sential element of risk management is the continuous review of the relevance of the 
original assessment and its context, hazards and mitigations.  This is especially important 
when there are changes in the circumstances or conditions of the assessment to e nsure 
that it remains valid and provides the appropriate level of safety.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Royal New Zealand  Air Force (RNZAF) notified the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission (Commission) of the incident on the evening of Monday 7 October 2013 in 
accordance with the terms  of a memorandum of understanding between the Commission and 
the New Zealand Defence Force .  The aeroplane was a military aeroplane carrying both 
military and civilian people  and the service was being provided  for a joint logistics pool 
involving Antarctica New Zealand and the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United 
States .  Consequently, t he Commission determined that the incident involved a combinati on of 
military and non -military transport -related service and persons . 
2.2. On 11 October 2013 the Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , because it believe d that the circumstances of 
the incident ha d or were  likely to have significant implications for transport safety .  The 
Commission's inquiry was conducted  in parallel to the RNZAF  inquiry  under the terms of the 
memorandum of understanding . 
2.3. On 14 October 2013 the investigator  in charge and a second C ommission investigator, both 
with experience operating to and within Antarctica, travelled to Auckland to interview members 
of the crew.  Th e crew  members interviewed  include d the four pilots present on the flight  deck 
during the flight south, and the chief loadmaster who managed the cabin.  Ot her personnel 
interviewed  include d the Commanding Officer 40 Squadron, which operate d the Boeing 757 
and C130 Hercules aircraft, and RNZAF  safety staff.  
2.4. Flight planning documents and copies of operating procedures  and other related data w ere 
collected , including weather information provided before and during the flight and all 
messages sent and received via the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system 
(ACARS) .  During  the next few weeks  investigators  had discussions with Antarctica New 
Zealand and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) personnel, including a 
representative of the MFAT group that had travelled on the flight.   The Commission also 
obtained information from an overseas commercial operator that regularly flew to Antarctica .    
2.5. On 21 October 2013 the Commission, through Antarctica New Zealand , passed written 
questions  to the National Science Foundation , mainly concerning the provision of 
meteorological information.  On 5 November 2013 the Commission received an initial 
response to the questions.  
2.6. On 24 October  2013  the Commission obtained a copy of the documents supporting the 
supplemental type certificate issued by the air force that gave  approval for the B oeing 757 to 
conduct flights t o Antarctica.  Other organisations that also provided information to the inquiry 
included the Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  (CAA) and Airways Corporation  of New 
Zealand (Airways) . 
2.7. On 16 December 2013 a list of supplementary  questions was sent to the headquarters of the 
National Science Foundation  in Washington. A response to the questions was received on 28 
January 2014.  The National Science Foundation  also supplied audio recordings of Pegasus 
Field tower radio and of a telephone conversation between the crew of the Boeing 757 and  
National Science Foundation staff  in the control tower . 
2.8. During July 2014 the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research 
(NIWA) conducted a review of Antarctic meteorology.  The focus of the review was to obtain a 
better understanding of seasonal variations in the Ross Sea area, in particular during the 
summer period.  Advice was obtained from the CAA's chief meteorological office r; the 
Meteorological Service of New Zealand ; and RNZAF meteorological support staf f.  On 21 
August 2014 NIWA provided a summary of seasonal weather conditions around Ross Island.  
2.9. On 24 September 2014  the Commission approved the draft report for distribution to 
inter ested persons for comment. The interested persons included the flight crew of the 
aeroplane, the Chief of Air Force for the RNZAF, the Divisional Manager for MFAT (Environment 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 Division), the Head of the Antarctic Infrastructure & Logistics Section of the N ational Science 
Foundation, the Chief Executive of Antarctica New Zealand and the Director of Civil Aviation.  
2.10.  Responses were received from all persons, with substantive submissions made by the 
National Science Foundation, RNZAF and CAA.  Their submissions  were considered in 
preparing the final report.  
2.11.  On 10 December 2014  the Commission approved the publication of the report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. History of the flight s 
Previous flight on  3 October 2013  
3.1.1.  On Thursday 3 October 2013, NZ7571, a n RNZAF  Boeing 757 -2K2 aeroplane (the aeroplane) 
flew the first of three  flights planned for the early summer season from Christchurch to 
Pegasus Field  in Antarctica .  The flights were part of a joint logistics pool involving Antarctica 
New Zealand  and the Nation al Science Foundation of the United States .  A further three  flights 
were planned for February and March  2014 .3  The flight to Pegasus Field  normally t ook about 
four hours and 45 minutes, depending on the winds  encountered .  A refuel was required 
before the aeroplane  return ed to Christchurch . 
3.1.2.  The flight crew  (the crew) for the first flight consisted of a captain, who was also an instructor 
on the Boeing 757 , a captain under training and a co -pilot.  The flight was uneventful and the 
opportunity was taken during the flight south to talk with a senior United States Antarctic 
Program4 weather forecaster who was travelling to McMurdo for the summer season. The 
approach to and landing on runway 335 at Pegasus Field were flown in visual meteorological 
conditions .   
3.1.3.  The captain  under training, who was sitting behind the two pilot seats , took photographs of the 
area and the runway during the approach  (see Figure 1) .  The crew was also able to  validate 
the accuracy of the area navigation (RNAV) global positioning sy stem (GPS) instrument 
approach for runway 33.  The crew  noted after landing  that the runway centreline was offset to 
the right  of the published inbound track information  by about 15 m etres  (m).6   
Incident flight on 7 October 2013  
3.1.4.  Adverse weather conditions in the McMurdo Sound area meant that the second flight 
scheduled for Saturday 5 October 2013 was delayed  twice until Monday 7 October 2013 .  A 
second captain joined the crew on the Sunday afternoon .  The planned load for the flight 
consisted of 117 passengers, including a New Zealand Government Minister , MFAT staff  and 
Antarctica New Zealand and United States Antarctic Program  personnel .  The 13 -person 
aeroplane crew co nsisted  of the four pilots , three  loadmasters , four flight stewards and two 
engineers.  
3.1.5.  At about 0 600 on 7 October 2013, the crew and authorising officer assembled at Christchurch 
International Airport and received a briefing package for the flight.  The package included  
several satellite weather images, upper -level wind charts and the current aerodrome forecast 
(referred to by the industry as a TAF) for Pegasus Field.  The TAF predicted scattered  and 
broken  layers of cloud between 4,000 feet and 12,000 feet , with conditions improving during 
the da y.  (See Appendix 1 for  a timeline of events. ) 
3.1.6.  At 0611 the crew held a video conference with the briefing officer who had prepared much of 
the weather information.  The briefing officer worked in the United States Navy's Space and 
Naval Warfare Systems Com mand  - Office of Polar Programs  (SOPP) in Charleston, South 
Carolina.  The briefing officer predicted th at th e conditions at Pegasus Field would  continue to 
improve during the morning , confirming the aerodrome forecast . 
                                                        
3 The flight schedule for the summer season was developed from initial negotiations between the  National 
Science Foundation and Antarctica New Zealand, and was not determined solely by the RNZAF.    
4 The United States Antarctic Program is funded and managed by the National Science Foundation.  
5 Unless otherwise stated, all directions in this report , including runway alignment and surface winds, are 
referenced to grid north. See the glossary for an explanation of the "grid" system .   
6 A likely consequence of the ice shelf moving since the runway and instrument approaches had last been 
validated at t he beginning of the previous summer season.  

<< Page 6 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 3.1.7.  At about 0700 the crew received the first Pegasus Field weather observation for the day.  The 
observation reported the presence of mist with some cloud on the ground and "few"7 cloud at 
3,000 feet.  The surface and horizon definitions were both reported as  fair.  (See paragraph 
3.3.5 for explanation s of terms.)  The crew telephoned the SOPP facility in Charleston and was 
advised that this was not unusual for the time of year and the mist and fog w ere expected to 
clear during the morning.  This was confirmed  in a new aerodrome forecast  that was issued 
shortly after wards .  The crew decided to delay their departure by one hour to collect more 
information and to evaluate  any trends.

3.1.8.  During  the next two hours the crew received a nother  aerodrome forecast  and four 
observations, consisting of two routine weather reports (METARs) and two special weather 
reports (SPECIs) .8  The crew also contacted the crew of an RNZAF C130 Hercules that had 
remained overnight at McMurdo and was preparing to return to Christchurch.  The combined 
information showed th at th e weather conditions were improving as forecast.  At 0957 the 
aeroplane  departed Christchurch  with the flight number NMB 569 . 
3.1.9.  The flight was planned to take four hours and 40 minutes , with an estimated time of arrival at 
Pegasus Field of 1437.  Because the Boeing 757 aeroplane could not carry sufficient fuel to 
reach Pegasus  Field and return without refuelling, t he operating procedures used a  point of 
safe return ( PSR) methodology , meaning the calculation of the point that the aeroplane could 
reach and have sufficient fuel reserves to return to Christchurch.  Once the aeroplan e flew 
beyond that point, it was committed to a landing in Antarctica, where it could be refuelled for 
the return journey.  
3.1.10.  Two PSR scenarios were calculated.  The first and most conservative was PSR 2 -engine 
depressurised (PSR -2d), which was based on the a ssumption that the aeroplane became 
unpressurised for some reason, meaning it would have to return at a low level with a 
consequent greater  fuel consumption .  The second scenario was  PSR-altitude (PSR -alt), which  
                                                        
7 Cloud is reported in oktas or eighths and few is one to two eighths.  
8 The weather observers will submit a special observation if there is a significant change in one or more 
specified weather criteria.  

 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 7 >>
 meant a normal high -altitude return .  PSR-2d was the primary ( more conservative ) scenario  
used .  For the outward journey to Antarctica the aeroplane was estimated to reach PSR -2d at 
1244 . 
3.1.11.  As the aeroplane  flew south the crew received regular weather reports.  The crew contacted 
the SOPP facili ties in Charleston and McMurdo by satellite telephone and discussed the 
inclusion of fog in the later reports.  The crew was assured th at th e fog was in the distance 
and would not affect the airfield.  The surface and horizon definitions improved from fair to 
good.   
3.1.12.  Before  reaching PSR -2d the crew re quested a n updated  forecast for Pegasus Field , which they 
received at 1216 . The forecast conditions met the criteria to continue past PSR -2d.  
Nevertheless, the crew was concerned about the continued presence of  fog in the reports  and 
again c alled  the SOPP facilities in Charleston and McMurdo .  The  crew w as reassured that the  
weather forecasts predicted the fog to be "shallow" and moving to the west away from the 
field.  The crew was told that they could expect v isual meteorological conditions for the 
descent and landing.    
3.1.13.  At 1225 a SPECI report was issued by the SOPP  for Pegasus Field, but this was never received 
by the crew and no record could be found of this being sent to the aerop lane or the crew 
requesting it .  At 1244, after completing a crew briefing and confirming the decision to 
continue, the aeroplane  passed PSR -2d. 
3.1.14.  At 1257 the crew received the Pegasus Field weather report issued at 1255.  The report was 
similar to the SPECI report issued 30 minutes earlier , which had reported an increase in the 
cloud.  The crew called the SOPP McMurdo facility , which  advised that the fog had remained 
over five kilometres (km)  away and  the sky  was clear over the airfield.  The aeroplane passed 
PSR-alt about 20 minutes later at 1325.  
3.1.15.  At 1345 the crew received a SPECI  that had been issued  at 1332.  The SPECI  noted cloud on 
the ground with a broken base at 300 feet.  The crew immediately called the SOPP McMurdo 
facility , which  advised that fog had now formed over the airfield.  The following two reports 
contained similar information , with the horizon definition lowering to poor  in the direction of 
the fog.  
3.1.16.  The crew  discussed the ir options and decided to fly the RNAV instrument approach to runway 
33.  Th at approach had a minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 360 feet.9  However, because 
the first 1,000 feet of runway were  not available for landing, the crew agreed to raise the MDA 
to 410 feet to try to provide a constant glidepath an gle to touchdown.  To ensure that the most 
experience d combination of pilots was used , the captain moved into the left seat  to be the 
pilot flying , the co -pilot into the right seat and the second captain into the observer's seat 
behind the co -pilot. The fourth pilot , the captain under training,  remained on the flight deck as 
long as possible before taking a seat by one of the cabin emergency exits.   
3.1.17.  The crew requested the approach lights to be turned up to their maximum setting  for their 
approach .  The a eroplane was initially in visual conditions before entering a low cloud bank at 
about 700 feet.  At 410 feet the crew was unable to see any visual references so commenced 
the missed approach procedure, climbing to 5,000 feet and enter ing a holding pattern.  
3.1.18.  Approximately 10 minutes later a Canadian Twin Otter aeroplane also flew the runway 33 
RNAV approach.  The Twin Otter used the published MDA of 360 feet , but was u nable to gain 
visual reference with the airfield .  The Twin Otter was ski-equipped , so it wa s diverted to 
Williams Field 17 km away where it made a visual approach and landing.  
3.1.19.  The weather was forecast to improve , so the crew entered a holding pattern to conserve fuel 
and review options.  After nearly two hours ' holding , and with the weather continuing to 
                                                        
9 MDA i s referenced to mean sea level.  The runway 33 threshold was 19 feet above mean sea level.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 deteriorat e, the crew of the aeroplane  reviewed their options and agreed that a second 
approach to runway 33 provided the best chance of becoming visual.  The crew also agreed  
that the MDA could be lowered to 100 feet .  This would  still provi de a safety margin above the 
known obstacles around the runway.  The flight crew briefed the remainder of the crew and 
passengers  and position ed crew and others beside the various emergency exits .  The 
aeroplane then commenced  its second approach at 1620 .  
3.1.20.  At 100 feet the crew was still unable to gain visual reference and commenced the missed 
approach procedure.  As the aeroplane started to climb away, the second captain observed 
several  markers and some lights  about 15 m  out to the right of the aeroplane.  After the 
missed approach procedure was completed, the second captain reported his observation to 
the captain.  The crew compared  this information with photographs taken by the captain under 
training during the approach and landing four days earlier.   The markers and lights  were 
identified as being the runway centreline approach indicators , which  confirmed to the crew 
that the approach track was about 15 m  to the left of the runway centreline.  
3.1.21.  At 1645 the aeroplane was positioned about 15 km from the runway for a long straight -in 
approach  commencing from 2,500 feet.  At 1,000 feet, while still above the low cloud bank , 
the aeroplane was turned to the right to move the approach track to the right by about 15 m  
before returning to the original heading .  At about 110  feet the co -pilot called "visual, 
continue", meaning  he had sufficient visual references with the runway for the landing to be 
made .  
3.1.22.  At this time t he captain looked up from the instruments and said he was able to make out 
some ground markings  and then the markers  on both sides of the runway, confirming h e was 
lined up with the centre of the runway  (see Figures 2 and 3) .  He disconnected the autopilot 
and shortly after  flared the aeroplane for a normal landing.  
3.1.23.  The aeroplane was brought to a halt with about 4,000 feet remaining.  A "Follow Me" vehicle 
met the aeroplane as it was taxied back to the apron, guiding it to a parking spot.  The fuel 
remaining on board  after  shutting down the engines was calculated to b e about 3,000 
kilograms, sufficient for one further approach if required.  The fog start ed to clear  about one 
and a half hours after the aeroplane had landed (see Figures 4 and 5) .

simulator and annual checks had been  completed on 13 and 26 February 2013 as part of his 
upgrade training.  His last annual medical examination had been  on 21 August 2013.   
3.2.9.  The second captain had flown to Antarctica on 10 occasions before the incident flight, on 
Hercules and Boeing 757 aeroplanes.  He recalled one turn -back to Christchurch on 11 
February 2011 because of deteriorating weather conditions at Pegasus Field.    
3.2.10.  The majority of the crew had de ployed to Christchurch on Tuesday 1 October 2013.  The 
Wednesday had been  spent preparing for the first three fligh ts to Pegasus Field, including 
attending  briefings and liaising with other operators either flying or preparing to commence 
flying  to Antarct ica.  On Thursday 3 October 2013, the crew had flown  the first of the flights to 
Pegasus Field and return.  Friday 4 October had been  a crew rest day.   
3.2.11.  The next two days had consisted of attending the first "G o/No go" meeting s held at 0450  
each morning , where it was agreed that the weather  conditions were unsuitable to depart .  
The crew had spent the remainder of the day s on administration work, studying or unassigned .  
At about 2000 each evening the crew had prepar ed for the possibility of a flight the next day 
by organising weather information and flight plans, before retiring at about 2100.     

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 3.2.12.  The second captain  had joined the crew on the afternoon of Sunday 6 October 2013, the day 
before the incident flight.  He ha d had a rest day on the Saturday after five days ' work, 
including three  days flying between New Zealand and Australia.  
3.2.13.  The pilots each reported that they were well rested and prepared for the flight on 7 October 
2013.  
3.3. Meteorological  information  
3.3.1.  In accordance with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organi zation (ICAO), the 
CAA was responsible for the provision of meteorological information within the New Zealand 
and Auckland Oceanic flight information region s, including the airspace  between New Zealand 
and Antarctica  (AIP, 2011) .  The Meteorological Service of  New Zealand, as a certificated 
organi sation , was approved by the CAA to provide this service.  However, because of logistical 
restrictions,  routine aerodrome weather informatio n, including forecasts, observations and 
special weather reports, w as provided by the SOPP .   
3.3.2.  Antarctic weather data was collected from a range of sources, including weather satellites and 
automatic weather stations and observers in  Antarctica.  Weather ob servers were stationed at 
the American -operated  airfields on the continent .  The observer s were required to have a 
minimum of two years ' experience as qualified weather observer s and pass  local certification 
standards before being able to issue observations in Antarctica.  Two weather forecasters 
were assigned to the SOPP McMurdo facility .  A forecaster needed to have a minimum of 10 
years ' forecasting experience, including at least three  years at an aviation weather facility , and 
to have completed local certification standards before qualifying to issue forecast s for 
Antarctic locations .    
3.3.3.  Most observers and forecasters arrive d in Antarctica at the start of the summer  season , 
before the main flying activity commenced and before a 24 -hour service was required .  In the 
interim , staffing was based around scheduled flights to ensure that appropriate services  and 
information were  available to pilots .  The  services  consisted of pre -flight briefing packages, 
flight briefings, hourly METARs, SPECI s as required and six-hourly TAFs , with amendments 
issued as required.   Weather information was fed into the collective international weather 
database that provided weather i nformation globally.   
3.3.4.  The crew of the aeroplane  was issued with the weather information described above .  At the 
request of the crew, the frequency of the observations was increased from one every hour to 
one every 30 minute s.  Three  air traffic control s taff and one certified weather observer were 
in the Pegasus Field tower to support the aeroplane  for the duration of its flight.   
3.3.5.  Because of the unique characteristics associated with Antarctic weather, horizon and surface 
definition s are used to help describe  the conditions.  The  definitions are as follows :

 Table 1: United States  Antarctic Program Inter -agency Air Operations Manual, dated 1 August 2012  
Qualitative term Surface definition  Horizon definition  
Good  Snow surface features such as 
sastrugi10, drifts and gullies are 
easily identified by shadow.  The 
sun is usually unobscured.  Surface 
features are clearly defined for as 
far as the eye can see.  The horizon is shar ply defined by 
shadow or contrast.  The horizon is 
distinct with an obvious difference 
between land (snow) and sky.  
Fair Snow features can be identified by 
contrast.  No definite shadows 
exist.  The sun is usually totally 
obscured.  Surface features 
become indistinct at distances of 
more than a few kilometres.   The horizon may be identified, 
although the contrast between sky 
and snow is not sharply defined.  
Poor  Snow surface features (e.g. 
skidoo11 tracks) cannot readily be 
identified except from close  up 
(within 50 m).  The sun is usually 
totally obscured.  The horizon is barely discern ible; in 
other words, the sky can be 
discriminated from land but no 
distinct horizon is visible.  
Nil Snow features cannot be identified.  
No shadows or contrast exist.  Dark -
coloured objects appear to float in 
the sky.  The su n is totally 
obscured, although the overcast 
sky may exhibit considerable glare.  
The glare appears equally bright 
from surface reflection and from all 
directions.  Total loss of horizon: the snow 
surface merges with the whiteness 
of the sky.  
3.3.6.  Satellite imagery and weather maps show that on  the morning  of the incident  there was a 
weak upper -level low or depression over the Terra Nova Bay area, with a trough extending on  
to the Ross Ice Shelf.  The National Science Foundation was asked to provide comment o n the 
weather situation during the day.  Its response included comment from an observer based at 
Pegasus Field and a forecaster.  
3.3.7.  The forecaster said that they expected an upper -level ridge to move in during the day, pushing 
a low-pressure system  away.  A small high-pressure system near  Ross Island and associated 
with the ridge was expected to have a drying effect over the area.   The National Science 
Foundation commented that the presence of morning fog or low stratus cloud and the 
fluctuations wit h a slight improvement as the aeroplane  approached the PSR, going from 
(cloud) few to scattered  and back to few, supported the belief that the situation was improving 
overall.  T he forecaster commented that they  had "seen this sort of scenario numerous tim es" 
and that "the stratus [cloud] coming down through McMurdo Sound hugging the true west 
coast of Ross Island would be a short -lived occurrence, of three or four  hours ' timeframe ".  
3.3.8.  The observer said that the low cloud in the distance "made its way to the  airfield and at 
[1225] it became SCT003  [scattered  at 300 feet ]".  The cloud cover continued to increase  
and as recorded in the 1332 SPECI it became  a cloud layer broken  at 300 feet.   The weather 
then deteriorated quickly and by the time the 1515 SPECI was issued the visibility from the 
tower had reduced to 400 m in fog.

Appendices 2 and 3.  
3.4. Airspac e and local area information   
3.4.1.  Airways  was the CAA-certificated organisation responsible for the provision of air traffic 
services in the Auckland Oceanic flight information region12, including the area  of airspace 
between New Zealand and Antarctica .  Airways entered into an arrangement with the United 
States Navy13 on how to manage that portion of airspace below 6 0º south , known as the 
McMurdo Sector .  The sector was to be activated in anticipation of a flight using a mechanism 
called a NOTAM  (notice to  airmen) .  The sector then became the responsibility of the United 
States Navy.    
3.4.2.  At the start of each  summer season the McMurdo Sector was activated  on a flight -by-flight 
basis.  Once the aircraft had either landed in McMurdo or vacated the sector enroute to 
Christchurch, the sector  was deactivated.  During the peak  of the season the sector  remain ed 
continu ously activ e.  On 7 October 2014 the sector was activated by NOTAM at 0600 in 
anticipation of the flight s by the aeroplane  and the Hercules  aeroplane that was scheduled to 
depart Pegasus Field  that morning .  
3.4.3.  A review of the management of the McMurdo Sector showed that the Letter of Agreement 
current at the time of t he incident , and effective from 20 December 2012, was between 
Airways and  the Joint Task Force14 only.  This replaced a n agreement dated 20 December 
2005.  No copy of th e 2005 agreement  could be found.  However, a  letter of agreement dated  
31 October 2002 showed that the CAA was party to the agreement made between Airways 
and the then Commander of Support Forces Antarctica  for the creation and management of 
the McMurdo Sector.  
Airfield information   
3.4.4.  Pegasus Field was located on the Ross Ice Shelf about seven  nautical miles grid north of 
McMurdo  Station  (see Figure 6) .  The airfield consisted of one major runway orientated 33/15, 
with a nearby second skiway for ski -equipped aeroplanes.15  The runway was constructed o n 
permanent ice for use by w heeled aeroplanes and was normally 10,000 feet long and 150 
feet wide  (approximately 3 ,050 m x 45 m) .16  On 7 October 2013 a  NOTAM advised that an 
inset threshold for runway 33 reduced the available length to 9,000 feet  (2,745 m) .

3.4.5.  Instrument approaches , including a tactical air navigation system  (TACAN ) and RNAV (GPS) , 
were published for both runways .  The Boeing 757 was equipped for the RNAV (GPS) 
approaches only.   The instrument approaches were subject to annual calibration check s, with  
the next check due by  29 October 2013.  
3.4.6.  Runway 33 was equipped with approach lights  (including sequenced centreline strobe lights ), 
runway -end identification lights and a precision approach path indicator.  All of t he lighting 
systems were operating at the time of the occurrence and were set to the highest intensity 
available  as the aeroplane  made each approach .  The re was no approach lighting system for 
runway 15.  Marker boards were located  every 500 feet on each side of the runway , with  
"distance -to-go" indicators ev ery 1 ,000 feet.     
3.4.7.  The Pegasus Field rescue fire service was equipped to ICAO category 8 to cater for C17 
Globemaster aeroplane  operations .17  The Boeing 757 required category  7 support  only.  At 
the time the aeroplane was making its final approach , the emergency services at Pegasus 
Field had been  placed on alert and the aerodrome emergency plan had been activated.  Th e 
plan included placing support services at McMurdo Station and Scott Base on standby.  
Local area information  
3.4.8.  Three other aerodromes or landing areas  were located about McMurdo Sound .  They  included 
Williams Field, the Ice Runway and the emergency w hiteout landing a rea.  Williams Field  was 
located nine nautical miles west of Pegasus Field, but was only suitable for ski -equipped 
aeroplanes.  The Ice Runway was located near McMurdo .  It was a temporary runway made on 
the annual sea ice  and was normally  capable of handling wheeled  aeroplanes.  However, on 7 
October 2013 the Ice Runway had yet to be opened for operations and lacked any emergency 
services  or approach aids .  The whiteout area was a designated area west of Williams Field 
suitable for ski -equipped aeroplanes only.

 Final report AO -2013 -009 3.4.9.  A fourth runway a t the Italian station at Terra Nova Bay, 190 nautical miles grid south of 
McMurdo, was designed to handl e aircraft no larger than the Hercules. 18  On 7 October 2013 
it had yet to be open ed for the summer season  and the level of emergency services was 
unknown .  
3.4.10.  Other than the airfields listed above, the nearest airfields that could possibly be used by the 
Boeing 757 are the blue ice runways19 about 2, 100 km away at Wilkins , near the Australian 
Casey Station, and Union Glacier  operated by Chile  in the Ellsworth Mountains .20

3.5. Operator and aeroplane information  
3.5.1.  The Boeing 757 and Hercules aeroplanes were  both operated by 40 Squadron , out of the 
RNZAF base in Auckland.  The RNZAF had commenced regular flights from Christchurch to 
McMurdo as part of the joint logistics pool in 1965 , using Hercules aeroplanes.  The Boeing 
had become part of the joint pool in 2010.  Between 1965 and 7 October 2013, the RNZAF 
had completed 650 return flights to Antarctica , including 1 4 flights using the Boeing 757 .  
Following this incident t he Boeing 757 comp leted a further three uneventful flights before the 
close of the 2013/2014 summer season.  
3.5.2.  The RNZAF advised that before the commencement of each season 's flight s, crews complete d 
pre-deployment training.21  This include d survival training, aeroplane simulator training and 
the practice of self -contained approaches .22  A lecture programme include d discussion s on 
Antarctic procedures , weather, navigation  and flight planning .  There was also  a review of the 
previous season 's operations , including  any lessons learnt.  New crew members were  put 
through a training and familiarisation programme before being approved  to operate to the 
Antarctic un restricted .  Before the commencement of each  flight, an authorisation process 
was followed  to ensure that risks associated with the flight were  identified and addressed 
before approval was given.   This complimented an annual risk management plan covering

 The Boeing 757 -2K2 and Antarctic operations  
3.5.3.  The RNZAF operate d two Boeing 757 aeroplanes, and both  entered service in 2003.  In 
October 2004 a three -person team was directed to investigate the feasibili ty of conducting 
flights to Antarctica  using the Boeing 757 aircraft .  The team recommended against the use of 
the aeroplane s, primarily because of the incompatibility of the navigation equipment then 
fitted to the aeroplanes.   
3.5.4.  In July 2006 a Cabinet Busi ness Committee accepted the advice that Antarctic operations with 
the Boeing 757 were neither safe nor practicable.  However, i n December 2006 the Cabinet 
Policy Committee agreed on the importance of New Zealand retain ing a strategic air supply 
capability for continued Antarctic operations.  The committee identified this as a core defence 
output and concluded that th e Boeing 757 as a passenger aeroplane could complement  the 
United States ' C17 Globemaster transport  aeroplan e, with t he Hercules continuing to support 
both passenger and cargo requirements as required.    
3.5.5.  The navigation equipment fitted to the aeroplanes was upgraded and i n 2008 a second 
feasibility study was initiated .  The study identified that a major risk con tinued to be weather 
deteriorating after the aeroplane had passed the PSR.  The PSR for the Boeing 757 was 
notionally three hours into the four-and-a-half-hour  flight from Christchurch to McMurdo.  This 
compared with a PSR of five hours for the seven -and-a-half-hour flight for the Hercules.  After a 
consideration of the flight time, the quality of available weather information and the PSR 
weather criteria, the PSR criteria were  amended by raising the minimum cloud base from 
2,000 feet to 5,000 feet.  The minimum visibility requirement remained at 8,000 m.  The 
residual risk of weather deteriorating from the amended PSR criteria to below the instrument 
approach minima in the final 90 minutes of the flight was  assessed as "unlikely"  and a flight 
trial wa s approved .   
3.5.6.  Trial Boeing 757 flights were flown  on 16 December 2009 and 11 February 2010.  Pilots w ho 
had experience flying the Hercules to Antarctic  were used, and  a United States Air Force 
reservist pilot with Boeing 757 and C17 Globemaster Antarctic e xperience  provided specialist 
advice .  An Air New Zealand standards pilot also provide d input.  
3.5.7.  After reviewing  the trial  the RNZAF considered that the 5,000 -foot PSR cloud base minima was  
restrictive, especially when compared with that used for other aircr aft and operators.  The 
RNZAF Hercules continued to use a 2,000 -foot cloud base and 8,000 m visibility , while the 
United States C17 Globemaster had a cloud base limit of 1,500 feet and 4,800 m visibility.  
The 5,000 -foot cloud base was amended to 2,000 fee t.  On 29 November 2010 the Chief of 
Air Force approved the Bo eing 757 for routine passenger flights to Antarctica with the issu e of 
a supplemental type certificate.  
3.5.8.  Discussions with Antarctica New Zealand, the National Science Foundation  and pi lots 
confirmed that it was not unusual for flights departing from Christchurch to be delayed 
because of current or forecast adverse conditions at McMurdo .  The delays could be up to a 
week or more .  Less common, but still not unusual, were aeroplanes turni ng back to 
Christchurch at or before reaching the PSR.  Precise numbers were not available , but it was 
considered  to be fewer  than five flight s out of about 110  each summer season involving 
aeroplanes from New Zealand, the United States and other operators  contracted to provide 
logistic s support.23 
3.5.9.  A review of the history of RNZAF flights to Antarctica initially identified only one previous 
occasion when the weather had deteriorated below the instrument approach minima after the 
aeroplane had passed the PSR.   On 10 November 1993, a n RNZAF  Hercules was following 
about one hour behind an Italian Air Force Hercules enroute to the Ice Runway at McMurdo.  
After both aeroplanes had gone past the PSR, the weather at McMurdo deteriorated to near -
whiteout conditions.  Unbeknown to the New Zealand crew, the Italians had recently 
constructed an airstrip at the Italian station at Terra Nova Bay that could  handl e the 
                                                        
23 In the 2013/2014 summer there were six recorded turn -backs out of 109 p rogrammed flights.  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 Hercules.24  The station was approximately 190 nautical miles from McMurdo and close to the 
direct Christchu rch-to-McMurdo track.  The poor weather conditions were expected to last for 
several hours , so the RNZAF crew followed the Italian  aeroplane  and diverted to Terra Nova 
Bay, where a safe landing  was made .   
3.5.10.  An investigation by the RNZAF into th at incident identified the standard of weather forecasting 
as a contributing factor  to the Hercules having to divert to Terra Nova Bay.   A United States 
Navy ski -equipped Hercules , scheduled to land at Williams Field at about the same time as the 
RNZAF Hercu les was to land on the Ice Runway , was unable to do so .  After five failed 
attempt s the aeroplane diverted to the whiteout  area and made a safe landing.   A United 
States Air Force C141 Starlifter that was scheduled to depart Christchurch an hour after the 
RNZAF Hercules was stopped from departing because of concern s about the deteriorating 
weather condition s.  Th e Starlifter  would have landed about an hour before the RNZAF 
Hercules.   
3.5.11.  On 17 November 2014 the RNZAF informed the Commission of a second inciden t in which  the 
weather conditions had deteriorated significantly after an aircraft passed the PSR.  That 
incident was on  24 January 2002 , when the crew of a Hercules made the decision to continue 
past the PSR based on "a favourable forecast and conditions, de spite distant (10 kilometres) 
fog".  Forecasters were also involved in the discussion on the weather conditions.  "In the 
space of one hour the weather deteriorated from an 8 ,000-foot cloud base to an 
indeterminate ceiling, visibility reduced from 10 kilom etres to 400 m etres , while su rface and 
horizon definitions reduce d from Fair/Fair to Nil/Nil."  Two United States ski -equipped 
Hercules were diverted from Williams Field to Pegasus Field, and the three aeroplanes were 
eventually able to land.  One aeroplan e landed off its first instrument approach.  The New 
Zealand Hercules landed off its second approach and the third aeroplane made three 
attempts before landing.         
3.5.12.  Number 40  Squadron's standard operating procedures and Ice Flip booklet contained 
planning and operating information for flights to Antarctica, including departure and PSR 
criteria for the Boeing 757.  The procedures noted that "while individual factors meet the 
requirements, in combination they may present an undesirable situ ation.  Crew input and 
experience are necessary for the Captain to make an informed decision" . 
3.5.13.  The departure criteria included  a combination of airfield and communication requirements, as 
well as  minimum forecast weather conditions.  These are summarised a s follows : 
1. full runway length and width to be available25 
2. a runway condi tion reading26 of nine  or greater and maximum groomed snow depth of 
one inch (25 millimetres ) 
3. the forecast weather for the period one hour before the estimated time of arrival to three 
hours after wards  was to be a cloud base of 2,000 feet or higher  and visibility greater than 
8,000 m , and the minimum  horizon and surface definitions to be a combination of fair 
and poor  
4. the forecast weather for the time of departure and the period three hours after wards  was 
to be a cloud base at least 1,000 feet above the MDA, a visibility of at least 8,000 m and 
the combination of definitions to be a minimum of  fair and poor  
5. the crosswind to be within limits  
6. runway approach and glidepath lighting to be available  
7. suitable communications to be available throughout the flight.27    
                                                        
24 At the time runway data had not been finalised and passed to other Antarctic Treaty nations.  
25 9,000 feet was considered sufficient provided all other criteria were met.  
26 A measure of the tyre -to-runway friction coefficient.  Dry (good) - 23, wet (medium) - 12, icy (poor) - 5.  
27 Including a possible combination of high -frequency radio and satellite communications.  
 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 19 >>
 3.5.14.  The PSR criteria required the crew to consider an updated arrival forecast for the period one 
hour before to three hours after the estimated time of arrival at Pegasus  Field .  In assessing 
the weather conditions consideration was also to be given to the three  most recent 
observations.  The  three observations  should show a trend towards the PSR forecast and 
current aerodrome forecast . 
3.5.15.   The following criteria were to be met before the aeroplane  could pass the PSR:  
1. cloud base.  Minimum of broken  cloud at 2,000 feet above ground level or 1,500 feet 
above MDA , whichever is the higher28 
2. visibility.  A minimum of 8,000 m ( five statute miles) was required and runway approach 
and glidepath lighting was to be available  
3. wind.  Maximum crosswind (including gusts) was not to exceed 20 knots29 
4. surface and horizon definitions .  No worse than one element fair, one element poor . 
Note: Restricted visibility in the PSR forecast implied definitions less  than fair/fair.   
3.5.16.  Meteorologists regarded w ind direction as a good indicator of weather t rends.  The 40 
Squadron operating procedures provided interpretation s of the likely t rends with various wind 
directions. These included:  
grid south : Depending on the sea -ice state, in the summer wind from this direction means  
moist air off the sea, which can cause cloud to wrap around Ross Island, 
occasionally spreading over the airfields in the form of fog or low cloud  
grid north: Lows moving in with strengthening wind, blowi ng snow and deteriorating ceiling  
grid west: Katabatic wind coming off [Ross Island ] glaciers helping to clear any low cloud  
grid east: Rare, with a similar effect as for the grid west wind.   
  
                                                        
28 The MDA for the runway 33 GPS approach was 360 feet.  Th erefore a cloud base of broken at 2,000 feet 
was the requirement for the flight.

 Final report AO -2013 -009 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The RNZAF  has provided regular transport flights to  Antarctica since 1965, as part of the  
aviation element in the joint United States - New Zealand logistics pool.  The Boeing 757 was 
included  in the pool in 2010 after the successful completion of two trial flights .  For the first 
three years the Boeing 757 was used primarily to return personnel from Antarctica at the end 
of each season.  The incident flight was the second  of six pre-planned flights from 
Christchurch to Pegasus Field  for the s eason  and the first tim e that the Boeing 757  had been 
used at the start of the season.   
4.1.2.  The weather in A ntarctic a is known for its severity  and potential to change  rapidly .  Weather 
systems move around the continent at pace and , partly because of its isolation and lack of 
weather data, forecasting can be  challenging .  Storms can form and dissipate with little or no 
warning.  The use of remotely located automatic weather stations, satellite imagery and 
computer modelling based on historical information has resulted in a stea dy improvement in 
the availability and accuracy of weather information.  Nevertheless, properly trained and 
experienced staff are still required to validate the data and provide real -time information to 
pilots.     
4.1.3.  On 7 October  2013  the forecast sent to the  crew of the aeroplane  before they reached the 
PSR was derived from a range of data sources and followed careful analysis by experienced 
forecasters.  However, the expected clearance of the low cloud did not occur .  Instead , soon 
after passing the PSR the low-level cloud and fog that had been  some distance from the 
airfield began to spread , quickly engulf ing the airfield . 
4.1.4.  The following analysis discusses  the circumstances  around  the crew 's decision  to continue 
past the PSR, and what occurred  for the crew to  be left  with no option other than to land at 
Pegasus Field in near -whiteout  conditions.  In particular the analysis cover s the following 
areas:  
1. preparation for the flight  
2. the decision to continue past the PSR 
3. the decision to descend below the MDA and land  at Pegasus Field . 
4.1.5.  The analysis also discusses t he risk of using the Boeing 757 for Antarctic operations , and in 
particular how changes in circumstances could affect the validity of the risk assessment made 
in support of the original decision to use the Boeing 757 for Antar ctic operations.  
4.1.6.  A further issue  that did not contribute to the incident, but is discussed, concern s the 
management of airspace within the McMurdo Sector, below 60º south . 
4.2. Preparation for the flight  
4.2.1.  The crew of the aeroplane  undertook the normal pre -deployment training, which included 
learning about Antarctic weather and flight planning considerations.  A weather forecaster with 
more than  five years of Antarctic forecasting experience also participated in the training.  The 
RNZAF had review ed past Antarctic operations and applied the lessons learned to its 
operations plan. T he captain had practi sed the whiteout  landing technique in a simulator .  The 
crew had therefore been prepared as far as possible for the forthcoming flight s and were well 
aware of the risks associated with the operation.  Collectively , the flight crew was well trained 
and experienced for Antar ctic flights.  
4.2.2.  The three flights planned for the early part of the season were primarily to carry personnel.  
The first  flight on 3 October 2013 went as planned.  The good weather conditions at Pegasus 
Field allowed the crew to re -familiarise themselves with the airfield layout .  The observing pilot 
took the opportunity to take photographs during the approach , which proved useful when 
planning for the final approach in near -whiteout  conditions . 
 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 21 >>
 4.2.3.  The crew also took the opportunity to assess  the accuracy of the aeroplane's navigation 
equipment and instrument approach data.  This suggested to the  crew  that the final appro ach 
track was some 15 m  to the left of the centreline of the runway.  This information also proved 
useful when faced with landing in near -whiteout  conditions.  
4.2.4.  With a normal  runway width of 200 feet, the 15 m or 45 -foot offset was a n issue that 
increased th e risk of operations into the a erodrome.  The instrument approaches , while still 
current,  were scheduled for revalidation within the following  three  weeks .  This issue is 
discussed later in the analysis when considering the changes in operational plans potentially 
affecting the initial risk assessment.  
4.2.5.  The flight was delayed for two days because of adverse weather condit ions at McMurdo.  The 
decision s on those occasions not to launch and continue as far as the PSR were  joint 
decision s by the authorising officer and the captain.  Weather delays were not uncommon and 
were accepted as part of normal Antarctic operations.  
4.2.6.  The passenger list for the flight south included a group of very important persons (VIPs).  There 
was no evidence to suggest that the decis ion-making by the crew was influenced by the 
presence of this group or the two -day delay because of the weather conditions at McMurdo.  
The crew was experienced in dealing with VIPs and were trained to prioritise the safety of the 
aeroplane.   
4.2.7.  The conditio ns on 7 October 2013 met the launch criteria and were considered by the crew 
and authorising officer to be very similar to th ose for th e first flight four days previously.  The 
weather systems had moved through and the forecast and briefing by the SOPP for ecaster 
were  for improving conditions.  Nevertheless, the crew delayed the departure to obtain further  
information .  Only after receiving an updated forecast  and additional  observations, having a 
second  briefing with the SOPP  staff  and getting confirmation from the crew of the Hercules 
departing Pegasus Field that the weather was improving, did the crew and authorising officer 
agree  that it was suitable to depart Christchurch.  
4.2.8.  The decision to depart Christchurch was well considered and appropriate based on  the 
information  that the RNZAF had received prior to the flight being authorised.  
Findings  
1. The crew was well prepared and sufficiently experienced for the flight . 
2. The decision for the aeroplane to depart Christchurch was w ell considered and 
appropriate based on the information that the RNZAF had received prior to the flight 
being authorised.  
4.3. The decision to continue past the point of safe return (PSR)  
4.3.1.  The crew obtained regular weather updates, including observations and forecasts, as the flight 
progressed south.  The crew also requested 30 -minute observations  rather than  the normal 
hourly report s.  The ea rly reports of f og in the distance caused the crew s ome initial concern , 
so they contacted the SOPP staff at McMurdo and in Charleston  to question this.  The  crew 
was told that the conditions were not unusual and  the fog would remain clear of the airfield.  
After receiving the forecast  prior to reaching the PSR, the crew  again  contacted both  the SOPP 
facilities and was again told that the conditions would improve . 
4.3.2.  The forecast prior to PSR was for conditions better than the squadron's  criteria  for continuing 
to Pegasus Field .  The forecast predicted  scattered  cloud at 300 feet, 3,000 feet and 8,000 
feet.  The minimum allowable was broken  cloud at 2,000 feet.   The forecast was for 
unrestricted visibility with the wind well below the 20 -knot limit.  The forecast wind direction 
was from the grid west , off the Ross Island glaciers .  According to the meteorologists ' guiding 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 information , the likely trend with the wind blowing from that direction should have been for 
any low cloud  to dissipate .  
4.3.3.  The two observations leading up to the PSR forecast reported t he surface wind swinging from 
the north -west around to the south.  However, the wind continued to change direction, moving 
to the east before becoming calm.  With the wind strength being so light, it may not have had 
the anticipated clearing effect, and th e fog was able to form  quickly  over the airfield . 
4.3.4.  The observations  prior  to the issuing of the PSR forecast varied but were all above the 
minimum criteria to continue and, with the exception of the reported fog in the distance, 
trended towards an improveme nt in the conditions.   The crew called both the SOPP facilities 
and asked about the fog.  Again they were r eassured  that it was not a factor and they could 
expect good conditions on arrival.  The airfield surface and horizon definitions continued to be 
better than the PSR criteria at good  and good  respectively . 
4.3.5.  The criteria to continue past PSR -2d included  a minimum cloud base  only; that is, broken or 
overcast cloud.   There was no allowance in the criteria for few or scattered  cloud or fog below 
this level.  This issue is discussed later in the analysis when considering the changes in 
operational plans potentially affecting the initial risk assessment  
4.3.6.  No reason could be found for the special weather report issued at 1225 , part of the normal 
30-minute cycle of reports,  not being forwarded to the crew of the aeroplane .  The crew had 
requested a special forecast (PSR forecast) because they were about to make a decision on 
whether to continue past the PSR.  This PSR forecast  was received some nine minutes before 
the 1225 special report was issued.   A quick review of the crew's weather log should have 
detected the missing report. The crew may therefore not have realised  that the 1225 report 
had not arrived , or been unconcerned  about not receiving it.  If the y were concerned they 
could have specifically requested the report.    
4.3.7.  The absence of the 1225 report  would have been  unlikely to  alter the actions of the crew 
because it contained information similar to that  in the following  weather report issued at 
1255 .  The 1255 report was received by the crew some 13 minutes after passing the first PSR 
(PSR-2d).  When the crew received it, they were reassured by the SOPP McMurdo facility  that 
the fog remained in the distance  and made the decision to continue.  At that time  the 
aeroplane still had about 25 minutes to run to the second  PSR (PSR-alt).  The crew therefore 
still had the option of returning to Christchurch or diverting to Dunedin - albeit  that a safe  
return would have to have been at normal cruise altitude . 
4.3.8.  The special  report issued at 1332  was not received by the crew until 1345 .  This was the first 
report that indicated to the crew that conditions had deteriorated.  Again , no explanation was 
given for th e unusually  long time  taken in forwarding  the report to the aeroplane .  Having 
already passed PSR -alt at about 1325 , the crew  was now committed to landing in Antarctica.   
Nevertheless, it is unusual that special weather observations and forecasts were either not 
sent or , as in this case, took a  significantly longer period of t ime than usual to be delivered .  
The various agencies  directly involved w ere aware that the aeroplane was near to the critical 
decision point, and that the weather conditions were essential  to the crew making that 
decision.  See safety actions at section  7. 
  
 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 23 >>
 Findings  
3. Based on the available weather information and the reassurance s by the United 
States Navy's Office of Polar Programs ' forecasters in Charleston  and McMurdo , the 
crew was justified in continuing  past the point of safe return . 
4. The absence of the 1225 special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 
special weather report, while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be 
examined further to ensure that safet y-critical information is passed to crews in a 
timely manner.   
 
4.4. Descent below minimum descent altitude  (MDA)  
4.4.1.  The crew, having passed the PSR , was left with no option other than to land in Antarctica , 
regardless of the weather .  A diversion to either Wilkins or Union Glacier  might have 
theoretically been  possible , but it was not viable, safe or practicable  for the following reasons:  
1. the crew did not have any weather information for either o f the airfields  
2. they did not have  information  on the winds for the routes to either destination  
3. they were not familiar with either location  
4. they did not have any information on the runways or whether  instrument approaches  
were available .  Because of the long distances involved, a ny decision to divert  would have 
needed to be made early and would have precluded  the option of holding in the McMurdo 
Sound area , possibly for two or three hours , waiting for the weather to improve.  
4.4.2.  The crew  raised the MDA for the first approach by 50 feet to 410 feet to all ow for the 
displaced threshold and in an attempt to provide a constant descent path through to 
touchdown.  Leaving the MDA  at the standard  360 feet would have increase d the possibility of 
sighting the runway  on the first landing attempt .  The final portion of the approach path could 
then have been adapted to ensure the landing was at least 1,000 feet along the runway.  
However, at 360 feet it was unlikely  that the crew would  have sighted the runway  anyway.  The 
Twin Otter  that attempted to land after the Boeing 757 aeroplane was using the 360 -foot MDA  
and still  had to overshoot .  And when the aeroplane descended to 100 feet on its second 
attempt to land , the crew still could not see anything until after the missed approach 
procedure was c ommenced.  
4.4.3.  The crew considered each of the other landing sites around McMurdo Sound , and agreed that 
Pegasus Field was the most suitable .  The MDA  for the runway 15 RNAV instrument approach 
was lower than that for runway 33 and the outer runway approach area was clear of 
obstruction s.  However, the entire ru nway , including the intermediate approach area,  was also 
obscured by the fog  and there were no approach or runway -end identification lights to lead the 
crew on  to the runway.  Further, the crew was not familiar with this runway and the approach 
would have been  towards the airfield building s and fuel storage area .  Runway 33 was 
therefore considered the safest and best option.   
4.4.4.  An MDA  for an instrument approach is set to  provide a safety margin above kn own obstacles  
during an instrument approach .  Normally a  pilot can descend below a MDA  only when they 
have the required visual references to help ensure a sa fe landing.  In this case the crew had 
no option other than to de scend below the minima. They were not expecting the weather to 
clear until after the aeroplane  had exhausted its  fuel and there was no other safe alternat ive 
aerodrome where they could  land.  
4.4.5.  All that the crew could do was to mitigate the risks.  In some res pects the RNZAF had begun 
that process before the flight depa rted Christchurch.  The captain being able to practi se 
landing in near -whiteout  conditions in a simulator would have been one such measure.  The 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 crew  used their experience and  familiarity with th e approach and airfield  to good effect .  They 
knew the location s and height s of the obstacles and were confident in the accuracy of the 
aeroplane's navigation equipment.  The second  approach confirm ed the accuracy of the 
instrument approach compared with the approach of four days earlier and gave them 
confidence that they could continue the descent and have a good chance of making a near -
whiteout  landing  on the runway . 
4.4.6.  They also took measures to reduce the consequences of an unsuccessful landing by briefing  
the emergency services and preparing the aeroplane cabin for such an eventuality.  The 
decision was the best one that any captain could have made  faced with similar circumstances.  
4.4.7.  The captain used the resources available to him to help ensure he had as much information 
as possible on which to make his decisions.  This incident provides a good example of a crew 
performing in a cohesive manner .  The successful landing was the result of an experienced 
crew performing well as a team and is a good e xample of crew resource management.   
Findings  
5. The RNAV approach to runway 33 at Pegasus Field was the best option for a 
successful landing.  
6. The decision to fly to a lower minimum descent  altitude was the only reasonable 
option available to the crew in order to make a successful landing . 
7. The incident was a good demonstration of effective crew  resource management that 
enabled a safe landing to be made in demanding circumstances.   
 
4.5. The risk of using the Boeing 757 for Antarctic operations  
4.5.1.  The fundamental safety issue arising  from  this incident  was not the decisions by the crew to 
pass the PSR and de scend the aeroplane below the MDA  in order to make a successful 
landing.  The issue and question is why the aeroplane ended up in that position  when the crew 
had followed standard operating procedures.  
4.5.2.  The use of the Boeing 757 -2K2 for Antarctic flights was subject to an extensive evaluation 
process before a supplementary type certificate was issued giving approval for Antarctic 
operati ons.  As part of that process a risk assessment was conducted.   The d eterioration of 
the weather after the aeroplane had gone past the PSR was listed as a "possible" risk.  In 
applying the risk treatment process the chances of this occurring we re reduced  to "unlikely".  
The risk mitigation was achieved by applying  the same PSR weather criteria  used by the 
Hercules, and applying  the notion  that when the  Boeing 757 reached its PSR it was one hour 
closer to its destination when compared with the Hercules  aeroplane .  On the grounds that 
there was one hour less for the weather to deteriorate before arrival , the risk  was considered 
to be  "significantly less".  The same principle used in the original type certificate risk 
assessment also filtered down to the risk  assessment for each individual flight.  This was a 
reasonable assumption, although it needed to be tempered with the knowledge that when 
localised weather conditions in Antarctica deteriorate, they can do so quickly , as happened in 
this case . 
4.5.3.  History show ed that the weather had deteriorated to or below approach minima after an 
aeroplane passed the PSR on only two occasion s out of 650 Antarctica flights in 48 years.  
The likelihood of this occurring was therefore reasonably low.  What was missing  from the r isk 
assessment were  the potential end consequence s of an event such as this occu rring when 
using the Boeing 757 , compared with those  when using  the Hercules aircraft.  The 
consequence of not being able to complete a visual or instrument approach successfull y was 
the same for both aircraft - a whiteout landing.  However, in the event of this occurring the 
likelihood of injury was significantly greater for the Boeing 757 , with its long landing gear 
 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 25 >>
 supporting low-slung engines on a low wing , than it was for  the Hercules  with its rough -field 
landing capabilities .  
4.5.4.  Compared with the Hercules , the Boeing 757 had  limited alternative approach options or 
aerodromes available in the event of the weather suddenly deteriorating below instrument 
approach minima .  The Hercules was fitted with a tactical air navigation system, commonly 
called TACAN, enabling it to fly a range of additional  instrument approaches to the various 
airfields and runways.  The Hercules could divert to Terra Nova Bay, subject to weather 
cond itions.  As a final resort it could also land either at Williams Field or in the whiteout  area , 
albeit sustain ing damage .  The only option noted in the risk profile for the Boeing was a "blind " 
landing off an instrument approach.   From a risk perspective t hen, the likelihood of the 
weather closing in was low, but the potential consequences for Boeing 757 operations were  
significantly more serious  than were those for  the Hercules aircraft.  
4.5.5.  The two trial flights had been  flown in December and February and , until 2013 , all subsequent 
Boeing flights had been  flown towards the end of the season , in either February or March.  The 
risk evaluation process made no reference to the time of year in which the flights were to be 
flown .  Meteorological advice on the su bject varied .  With the sea ice extending well to the 
(true) north at the beginning of the summer season, meteorologist s thought that there was 
unlikely to be the same level of relative humidity to help generate fog as there would be late in 
the season.    
4.5.6.  By contrast, NIWA found that "there is a marked deterioration in average weather conditions 
outside of the period November -February".30 The table below shows weather trend data

4.5.7.  The formation of fog around Ross Island was often associated with a depression or low 
centred near Cape Adare that pulled moist air down into McMurdo Sound.  The meteorological 
experts  consulted  agreed  that given the prevailing  conditions present  on 7 October 2013 , it 
would have been  reasonable to assume that a ny early -morning fog and low cloud would  
dissipate  with the advanc ing high pressure . 
4.5.8.  A second consideration with undertaking flights early in the season was the adequacy of the 
provision of weather information for flight crews .  Other than those personnel wintering over, 
weather forecasters and observers deploy ed south with the first few flights.  This mean t that 
until all posts were  filled, services had to  be tailored around the requirements of each flight.  
This was an unavoidable situation  and one recognised by t he crew of the aeroplane , who 
delay ed their departure from Christchurch to obtain additional  observations and to 
communicate with the crew of the returning Hercules .  The crew was also able to talk directly 
to both the SOPP Charleston and McMurdo weather office s and d iscuss the various 
observations and forecasts.  
4.5.9.  A third consideration was the validity and accuracy of the instrument approaches .  Some 
inaccurac ies resulting from  equipment limitations and satellite signal strength in the Antarctic  
can be expected .  However, with the use of augmented systems33, errors of less than three 
metres are not unrealistic .  The approximately 15-metre offset between the approach track 
and runway centreline identified by the crew of the aeroplane  was a further risk to the safety 
of aircraft using the runway .  The likely reason for the offset was  that the ice sheet upon which 
the aerodrome was located had moved during  the winter season .  This w as predictable.  
4.5.10.  The instrument approaches were  re-calibrated  annually  in mid to late Oct ober , before the level 
of aviation activity increased  significantly in support of summer programmes, camps and other 
stations.  The re-calibration  checks were  valid for one year and  could  only commence  once the 
first suitable airfield ha d opened .  Thus the re-calibration flights  could  only follow the initial 
deployment  flights . On 7 October 2013 the RNAV instrument approach to runway 33 was still 
within its validation period.     
4.5.11.  During better meteorological conditions , the 360 -foot minimum descent altitu de would 
normally be reached a t a point a bout two kilometres  from the runway.34  This should give 
sufficient time for a pilot to manoeuvre and position an aircraft towards the centre of the 
runway  for a safe landing .  In the near -whiteout  conditions experienced by the crew of the 
aeroplane on this occasion , however, the first indication that a pilot would have that the 
runway centreline was offset would be as he was flaring the aeroplane to land.   The offset 
runway was another factor that increased the risk of Antarctic flight operations early in the 
season, before re-calibration flights could take place.  
4.5.12.  The PSR forecast criteria  that the crew used to help them make the decision to continue past 
the PSR has provide d good guidance in the pa st.  One exception involved an  RNZAF Hercules 
                                                        
33 For example differential GPS and wide area augmentation system.  
34 Based on a standard 3º glidepath to touchdown.  
 
 
Final report AO -2013 -009 
<< Page 27 >>
 in 1993 , which was the result of inaccurate forecasting.35  In a second incident  involving 
rapidly deteriorating conditions in 2002, a Hercules was still able to land off the normal 
instrument approach, although  it required two attempts.  The standard of forecasting has since 
improved but , as shown in this incident, even with the best of resources available , localised 
weather in Antarctic a can still prove difficult to predict accurately.  
4.5.13.  The Boeing 757 and Hercule s36 are two large aircraft operating between New Zealand and 
Antarctica that require PSR s.  The New York  Air National  Guard Hercules  aeroplanes  are ski 
equipped and ha ve the option of diverting to unprepared areas if required.  The Austr alian-
modified civil  Airbus A31937 does not normally operate with a PSR unless it is heavily loaded.  
The United States C17 Globemaster usually has  a PSR some 20 -30 minutes out from landing 
at McMurdo.   This equates to about the start of the des cent for landing.  For the C17 
Globemaster to continue past the PSR, it requires a minimum 1 ,500-foot cloud base and 
visibility of 4,800 m.  
4.5.14.  The crew used the PSR weather criteria in deciding whether to proceed past PSR-2d, which 
made no allowance for the presence of cloud (few or scattered ) or fog below a 2 ,000-foot 
cloud base ( broken  or overcast ).  When assessing the risk, the presence of low cloud and fog 
near the aerodrome, regardless if forecast  to dissipate, still needs to be considered.  This is 
even more essential when opera ting earl y in the summer season when the NIWA data shows 
an increased risk of fog forming.  
4.5.15.  Finally, developments in Antarctica might mean that there are other destinations that a Boeing 
757 could use in the event of the weather conditions deteriorat ing below minima after an 
aeroplane has passed the PSR.  These possibilities should be investigated and considered 
when reviewing the risk assessment for Antarctica flights.  
Findings  
8. There was a low  likelihood of the weather conditions at Pegasus Field aerodr ome 
deteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return .  
However, the potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the 
Boeing 757 aircraft, because of the lack of alternative approach procedures  and 
aerodromes suitable f or this aircraft type.  
9. There are four factors that were not, but should have been, considered when 
assessing the risk of using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic operations:  
 the weather criteria for an aeroplane passing the point of safe return should 
consider the presence of low cloud and fog below the main cloud base as a 
limiting factor  
 there  is an increased likelihood of weather conditions deteriorating below 
minima early in the summer season  
 the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated w ith caution prior to 
calibration flights being conducted early in the summer season  
 the Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing aircraft is capable of completing only 
one type of instrument approach in Antarctica .

 Final report AO -2013 -009 4.6. Management of New Zealand ICAO allocated airspace  
4.6.1.  When considering wider aspects of its inquiry into this incident, the Commission noted an 
apparent anomaly in the management of the airspace known as the McMurdo Sector.  The 
anom aly did not contribute in any way to the incident.  
4.6.2.  The so -called "McMurdo Sector " was part of the Auckland  Oceanic  flight information region, 
which is airspace allocated to New Zealand by ICAO.  In accordance with  ICAO  requirements 
and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Act 199038, New Zealand 's civil aviation rules require tha t 
air traffic services and certain meteorological information  can only be provided within the flight 
information region by organisations certificated under New Zealand civil aviation  rules.    
4.6.3.  Under a letter of agreement, responsibility for the provision of  air traffic services for aircraft 
(military and civilian) operating within  the McMurdo Sector was passed from Airways to the 
Joint Task Force whenever the sector was activated by NOTAM.  Absent from the agreement 
was any involvement by the Director of Civ il Aviation , who was the only person  who had the 
authority to permit a sub-delegation of responsibility for the provision of services for this 
airspace.   The Meteorological Service of  New Zealand  was still to provide upper -level weather 
information , for example upper -level winds or forecast s of severe turbulence.  The Joint Task 
Force, through the SOPP, would provide routine aerodrome weather reports and forecasts.   
4.6.4.  In a 2006 ICAO audit of the New Zealand civil aviation system , a finding was made r elating to 
the provision of air navigation service s for the McMurdo Sector  (ICAO 2006) .  The finding 
stated:  
In order to facilitate Antarctic operations, a substantive portion of the southern part 
of Auckland Oceanic FIR [flight information region] is rel ease[d] to an alternative ATS 
[air traffic service] (McMurdo) under the terms of a letter of agreement between 
ACNZ [Airways Corporation of New Zealand] and McMurdo ATS.  However, the CAA 
does not have a mechanism in place to ensure compliance by McMurdo A TS with 
Annex 1139 and th e CAA does not conduct effective regulatory oversight over 
McMurdo ATS.40 
4.6.5.  In response to that finding the CAA stated:  
The finding is accepted.  New Zealand will enter into high level agreement with the 
Agency providing air traffic services in the Mc Murdo Sector to ensure that such 
services are provided in accordance with Annex 11 and to an equivalent standard as 
that provided by New Zealand Civil Aviation Rules.  
The estimated comp letion  date for the proposed corrective actions was July 2007.   See safety 
actions, paragraph 7.2. 7.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The crew was well prepared and sufficiently experienced for the flight.  
5.2. The decision for the aeroplane to depart Christchurch was well  considered and appropriate 
based on  the information  that the RNZAF had received prior to the flight being authorised.  
5.3. Based on the available weather information and the reassurances by the United States Navy's 
Office of Polar Programs ' forecasters in Charleston  and McMurdo , the crew was justifi ed in 
continuing past the point of safe return.  
5.4. The absence of the 1225 special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 special 
weather report, while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be examined further to 
ensure that safety -critical information is passed to crews in a timely manner.  
5.5. The RNAV approach to runway 33 at Pegasus Field was the best option for a successful 
landing.  
5.6. The decision to fly to a lower minimum descent  altitude was the only reasonable option 
available to the crew in order to make a successful landing.  
5.7. The incident was a good demonstration of effective crew resource management that enabled 
a safe landing to be made in demanding circumstances.  
5.8. There was a  low likelihood of the weather conditions at the Pegasus Field aerodrome 
deteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return.  However, the 
potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the Boeing 757 aircraft, becaus e 
of the lack of alternative approach procedures  and aerodromes suitable for this aircraft type.  
5.9. There are four factors that were not, but should have  been, considered when assessing the 
risk of using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic operations:  
 the weathe r criteria for an aeroplane passing the point of safe return should consider the 
presence of low cloud and fog below the main cloud base as a limiting factor  
 there  is an increased likelihood of weather conditions deteriorating below minima early in 
the sum mer season  
 the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated with caution prior to calibration 
flights being conducted early in the summer season  
 the Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing aircraft is capable of completing only one type of 
instrument approach in Antarctica .

 Final report AO -2013 -009 6. Key lessons  
6.1. Effective crew resource management enables a crew to perform as a cohesive unit and 
provides the best opportunity for a safe outcome.  This incident demonstrates how a properly 
trained crew was able to function effecti vely in demanding circumstances and make a safe 
landing.  
6.2. An essential element of risk management is the continuous review of the relevance of the 
original assessment  and its context, hazards and mitigations.  This is especially important 
when there are cha nges in the circumstances or conditions of the assessment to ensure  that 
it remains valid and provides the appropriate level of safety.

 7. Safety a ctions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
RNZAF Antarctic operations  
7.2.1.  Antarctic flights utili sing the Boeing 757 -2K2 were initially suspended  after the incident on 7 
October 201 3.  Three end -of-season fli ghts were approved subject to the aeroplane only being 
allowed to carry non -essent ial personnel from Antarctica to New Zealand.  This was not 
considered a safety action, rather an operating lim itation until other safety measures could be 
put in place.   
7.2.2.  On 26 February 2014  the standard operating procedures for the Boeing 757 were amended 
to cater for flights occurring before the annual  revalidation of the instrument approaches.  The 
new procedures state : 
At the beginning of each Antarctic summer season the RNAV (GPS) approaches need 
to be validated to confirm they are accurate.  Validation of these approaches must 
be conducted by RNP [required navigation performance] certified aircraft on the first 
missions of the season.  This validation can be conducted by either foreign RNP 
certified aircraft or RNZAF RNP certified aircraft.  If the approach has not been 
validated then the weather min ima must be increased to allow the approach to be 
flown in VMC [visual meteorological conditions] . Once a validation approach has 
been flown and proven to be accurate then subsequent RNP approaches may be 
flown in IMC [instrument meteorological conditions]  down to normal published 
minimas.    
7.2.3.  On 11 November 2014 the RNZAF issued a temporary order concerning revised 
meteorological requirements for passing the PSR.  The new requirements are to become 
perm anent with the next routine amendment cycle.  The new cloud -base minima are as 
follows : 
Minimum BKN [broken] 2000 feet above ground level or BKN 1500 feet above MDA 
for approach in use, whichever is higher.  Reported or forecast visible moisture below 
minima must be considered with crews ultimately being sati sfied that the drivers 
that may cause these conditions to worsen will not be present for arrival, e.g. 
FEW003 [few at 300 feet] will not degenerate to FOG at airfield.    
7.2.4.  The RNZAF advised that in addition to amending the weather criteria it had reviewed it s flight 
profiles.  As a result for the 2014/2015 season a revised flight profile supporting increased 
fuel carriage against an increased operational weight for the Hercules has been implemented.  
This means  that the Hercules PSR is moved to approximately 60-90 minutes from Pegasus, 
instead of the original  150-180 minutes from Pegasus.  Further, the implementation of risk 
management plans has been supplemented with an operational capability statement , which 
ensures that commanders are aware of operational l imitations or constraints and appropriate 
risk management practices can be implemented.  

<< Page 32 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 7.2.5.  The RNZAF had briefed all other flying squadrons that support Antarctica operations on the 7 
October 2013 occurrence.  The circumstances of the occurrence and the le ssons learnt had 
also been included in the training packages for future Antarctica operations.    
Weather information  
7.2.6.  The National Science Foundation advised that the SOPP was reviewing its 
processes/procedures for ensuring that reports are sent .  This would help to provide a second 
tier to ensure that a report was not missed by another party.  
Airspace management  
7.2.7.  On 20 November 2014 the CAA advised that the letter of agreement between Airways and the 
Joint Task Force - Support Forces Antarctica w as a provider -to-provider agreement  and did not 
transfer any of the State -based responsibilities for the provision of services; rather it worked 
as a technical co -ordination document between the parties. Further, that since the 2006 audit 
the CAA had worke d to clarify arrangements in the Auckland Oceanic flight information region, 
initially on contracts with Pacific States in the region.   The focus had now moved to the 
Antarctica arrangements and the CAA was working with the Ministry of Transport and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to open communications with United States agencies to 
seek a resolution to the McMurdo Sector oversight situation .

 8. Recommendation  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.    
8.1.2.  In this case, the Commission makes  one recomm endation  to the Chief of Air Force .  
8.1.3.  In the interests of transport safety it is important that this recommendation  is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring  in the future.   
8.2. Recommendation  
8.2.1.  There was a low likelihood of the weather conditions at Pegasus Field aerodrome deteriorating 
below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return.  However, the potential 
consequences of that happening were elevated for the Boeing 757 aircraft because of the 
lack of alternative approach paths and aerodromes suitable for this aircraft type.  
There are five factors that were not  considered , or only partly considered, but should have  
been when assessing the risk of using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctica operations:  
 the weather criteria for an aeroplane passing the point of safe return should consider the 
presence of low cloud and fog below the main cloud base as a limiting factor  
 there  is an increased likeli hood of weather conditions deteriorating below minima early in 
the summer season  
 the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated with caution prior to calibration 
flights being conducted early in the summer season  
 the RNZAF aircraft is capable of c ompleting one type of instrument approach only in 
Antarctica - a GPS approach  
 the lack of suitable diversion airfields and the consequences of a whiteout landing .   
The Commission recommends that the Chief of Air Force  review the risk assessment for using 
the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic flight operations, taking into account the se matters and 
any other matters not considered during the initial risk assessment . (024/14 ) 
8.2.2.  On 19 January 2015, the Chief of Air Force re plied in part:  
The RNZAF accepts and will implement the Commission's final recommendations 
from Inquiry AO -2013 -009 as follows.  
 Effective 11 November 2014 the weather criteria for Antarctic operations for 
all RNZF aircraft were amended by temporary order t o take in to account 
visible moisture below weather minima.   This temporary order will be 
enshrined in General Orders for New Zealand Defence Force Military Aviation 
Operations on the next amendment cycle (02 March 2015).  
 The Risk Management Plan (RMP)41 for Antarctic operations will be updated 
to include detailed recognition of the other four factors no later than 09 
                                                        
41 An RMP articulates and assess risks associated with specific activites (e.g. deployments for major 
operations), it supports the flight authorisation process.  An RMP is developed for Antarctic operations 
annually for each aircraft type.  

<< Page 34 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -009 February 2015, which is before the next scheduled flight to Antarctica.  I will 
write to you again with a copy of the updated RMP in due co urse.  
 The RNZAF aviation operational risk management system is currently befing 
refined.  In due course standard mission risk profiles capturing risks inherent 
to that mission will be published.  These profiles will support the development 
of activity base d RMPs.  Once the risk management system is finalised, the 
risk factors you recommend will be captured in the Antarctic operations 
mission risk profile for each aircraft type.  I do not have a completion date for 
this activity, but I will inform you when i t is resolved.
