The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.   The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On the morning of 3 November 2016, the bulk carrier New Legend Pearl  was east of 
Coromandel Peninsula on passage  between the New Zealand ports of Bluff and Marsden 
Point.  The crew were attempting to change a hoisting wire on one of its cargo cranes .  Part-
way through the task the hoisting wire snagged on the crane jib that was rest ing in its cradle, 
about eight  metr es above the hatch cover.  
1.2. One of the crew donned a safety harness and climbed up onto the crane jib, secured the 
lanyard of his harness around a luffing  wire and walked along the jib to unsnag the wire.  
However, the lany ard prevented him reaching the snag, and he was in the process of 
transferring the lanyard to a different securing point when he lost his balance or slipped and 
fell eight metres to the deck below.  He died from his injuries.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) found  that it was a bout as 
likely as not that the locking mechanism for the safety harness hook was not engaged, which 
allowed the lanyard to roll or burst out of the hook when the crew member fe ll, and that the 
safety harness was not suitable for the intended task.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that:  
 the risk assessment conducted prior to the crew starting the wire replacement on crane 
number 2 did not fulfil the requirements of the operator’s safety  management system, 
because it did not adequately identify and manage the risks associated with the task  
 the repeat failures of the crew to comply with safe working practices when working at 
height and the acceptance of using a substandard wire on a workin g crane are 
indications of a poor safety culture on board the New Leg end Pearl .  
1.5. The Commission identified two safety issues : the operator’s risk assessment process did not 
prevent the crew member  working at height with an inadequate fall -protection system ; and 
both  the safe ty management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet 
industry good practice.  
1.6. The Commission made one recommendation  to the flag state for the New Legend Pearl  to 
address these safety issues.   
1.7.  The key lessons  arising from the inquiry are : 
 working at height is a risky activity and all crew should use suitable safety harness es that 
are fit for the intended task s 
 working at height is a risky activity that must be properly managed using a formal risk 
assessment met hodology  
 attaching a safety harness by passing it through or around the securing point and back 
onto the lanyard is a dangerous practice that can result in inadvertent release unless the 
lanyard and hook are designed for that purpose .

 Final Report MO -2016 -205 2. Conduct of the in quiry  
2.1. At about 1700 on 3 November 2016 , the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the 
Commission) was notified by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand that a crew 
member had fallen from a crane and sustained head injuries on board the bulk carrier New 
Legend Pearl .  The vessel was proceeding towards a rendezvous with a rescue helicopter 
carrying a paramedic . 
2.2. At abou t 1815 , the Commission was updated by the Rescue Coordination Centre that  when 
the helicopter paramedic arrived  the crew member was already deceased .  The Commission 
opened an inquiry  the same day  under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigatio n 
Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.3. On the same day , the Commission notified the Panama flag administration  of the accident  and 
invited Panama to participate in the investigation in accordance with the International 
Maritime Orga nization ’s Casualty Investigation Code . 
2.4. On 4 November 2016 , two investigators travelled to Marsden Point and conducted interviews 
with the vessel’s crew and collected evidence.   One interview was conducted with the 
assistance of a Chinese interpreter.  Physical evidence removed from the vessel included : the 
safety harness that the deceased had been wearing;  a specimen  safety harness ; and 
documentary evidence.  
2.5. On 8 November 2016 , agreement was reached with the Panama flag administration that New 
Zealand woul d lead the inquiry and conduct the investigation on behalf of Panama.  
2.6. Additional information was sourc ed from Maritime New Zealand  (MNZ) , Bureau Veritas  (BV) 
and the ship’s operator.  
2.7. On 23 December 2016 , the Commission received the post-mortem  toxicology  report  from the 
Coroner’s Office.  
2.8. On 9 March 2017 , the Commission received the post -mortem report from the Coroner’s Office.  
2.9. All documentation received from the operator that was considered significant to the 
investigation was translated through the inter pretation services of the Department of Internal 
Affairs.  
2.10.  On 27 July 2017 , the Commission approved  the draft report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.11.  The draft report was circulated to six interested persons .  Five responses , including  two 
submissions , were received.  
2.12.  The Commission considered these submissions in detail and any changes a s a result have 
been included in the final report.  
2.13.  The Commission approved the report for publication on 27 September 2017.

 3. Factual information  
3.1.  Event s leading up to the accident  
3.1.1.  Prior to the accident the New Legend Pearl  had called at the  port of Bluff .  The vessel had been  
delayed for  several days ; it was alongside the berth from 0100 on 26 Octob er until 1 454 on 31 
October . 
3.1.2.  At 0800 on 26 October , cargo operations  commenced  using the ship’s cranes, but a fter about 
two hours  they were  stopped because  the stevedores2 observed what they thought was a crack 
in the structure of a crane . 
3.1.3.  The crew went to check the crane and demonstrated that what appeared to be a crack was only 
grease.  However , the port company had already reported their concerns  about the condition of 
the cranes  to MNZ.  A maritime officer from MNZ issued a  Notice of Imp osition ,3 dated 26 
October 2016 , which stated , ‘the four cargo cranes are not to be used for the lifting of any 
equipment or cargo ’.  Cargo operations  were halted until the cranes could be inspected and 
declared structurally sound  by a classification socie ty4 surveyor . 
3.1.4.  The vessel’s  operator ar ranged with its classification society,  BV, for a  surveyor to attend the 
vessel and carry out an occasional cargo gear survey .  There was a two -day delay  waiting for the 
surveyor to arrive , during which time the crew took the opportunity to carry out rust removal and 
painting on the cranes.  
3.1.5.  At about 1015 on 27 October , the port facility’s health and safety team were advised  by 
stevedore s that the crew on board  the New Legend Pearl  were not working safely .  The health 
and safety officers boarded the vessel and witnessed the crew working at height , on the cranes , 
without full  fall-protection  equipment  (see Figure 1) .  The ship’s duty officer was informed of 
their concerns and work on the cranes  ceased .

 Final Report MO -2016 -205 3.1.6.  At about 1730 on the same day, one of the port health and safety officers witnessed the crew 
once again working at height on the  cranes without fall protection.  The health and safety officer 
informed the master that under no circumstances should the crew be working without the 
proper personal protective equipment.  The health and safety officer sent a n online report  on 
the unsafe work  to MNZ.  
3.1.7.  On 28 October , an MNZ maritime officer conducted a Port State Control inspection ,5 and found  
several  deficiencies that had to be rectified before the vessel could depart from Bluff.  
3.1.8.  On 28  and 29  October , a surveyor from BV carried out an occasion al cargo gear survey .  Four 
recommendations  were issued which had to be carried out by 15 December 2016 . 
3.1.9.  MNZ  then  issued a Notice of W ithdrawal6 to remove the impos ition.  The deficiencies identified 
during the Port State Control  inspection  (see Appendix 2)  had also been rectified , so MNZ 
released the vessel from detention.  
3.1.10.  At about 1900 on 29 October , cargo operations resumed.   However, the stevedores were 
unhappy with the condition of the hoisting wires on number s 2 and 4 crane s (see Figur e 2). 
3.1.11.  The following day  the c rew fitt ed a new hoisting wire onto number 4 crane , which was the only 
spare wire on board .  This crane was prioriti sed because it was the only crane that c ould work 
cargo at n umber 5 hatch .   
3.1.12.  Later that afternoon the master em ailed t he agent at Marsden Point , the vessel’s next port,  to 
request  a quo tation for a new crane hoisting  wire.  The agent replied the following day, but  no 
order was placed  for a new wire.  Cargo was still able to be loaded  at Marsden Point with only 
three gangs ,7 and n umber 2 crane was not required . 
3.1.13.  The master consulted the operator and a decision was made to replace the hoisting  wire on 
number 2 crane with the old w ire that had been removed from n umber 4 crane.  The intent ion 
was to c hange the wire during the  passage from Bluff to Marsden Point  so that the  cranes were 
fitted with  the best available wires . 
3.1.14.  At 1454 on 31 October , the New Legend Pearl  departed Bluff for Marsden Point.

 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  By the morning of 3 November  2016 , the ship had endured  three days of strong winds  on its 
voyage to Marsden Point.  The master and the chief officer discussed the weather forecast.   
Because t he wind was still at Force 5 ,8 the master decided to  not allow the crew to change the 
wire on number 2 crane  that morning, but  agreed that  sea conditions might improve sufficiently 
by the afternoon.  At the morning meeting the chief officer talked to the crew about the 
procedure for changing  the wire.  
3.2.2.  By the afternoon , the wind had decreased to Force 49 and conditions had improved sufficiently 
to allow the wire  change to go ahead.  The chief officer completed a risk assessment and the 
working -at-height checklist before the work  commenced.  
3.2.3.  At about 1330 , the bosun ,10 the ship’s carpenter and the deck crew assembled on deck to 
change the wire on number 2 crane.  Ab out half an hour later  the chief officer joined the deck 
crew to supervise the work.  
3.2.4.  The carpenter and two able seamen climbed onto the crane -house to release the old wire at its 
termination point.  The wire was lowered to the deck, where the end was cut off neatly so that it 
could be  connected to the new wire with a cable sock11 (see Figur e 3). 
3.2.5.  The crew commenced heaving  the connected wires through the hoisting -wire sheaves , but 
stopped when  the cable sock snagged on the crane -jib12 cross -beam (see Figure 4).

 Final Report MO -2016 -205 3.2.6.  The bosun put on his safety harness and climbed up the ladder of number 1 crane and  across 
to the end of number 2 crane’s  jib (see Figure 4) .  He secured his safety harness lanyard13 
around  a luffing wire14 and walked along the jib to reach the point where the cabl e sock had 
snagged (see Figure 4). 
3.2.7.  When the bosun reached the cross -beam,  he could not reach the snag  with his lanyard  still 
secured around the luffing wire .  He unhooked the lanyard  to relocate it to a lower wire so that 
he could reach  it.  
3.2.8.  At some point i n the p rocess of moving the lanyard between the luffing wires , he lost h is 
balance and fell eight metres onto number 2 hatch cover.   None of the crew could say for sure 
whether the bosun was clipped onto a luffing wire  when he fell.   The safety harness was intact 
but the gate  (see Figure 8) of the securing hook was damaged.  
3.2.9.  The bosun was unconscious and bleeding , so the chief officer immediately sent the crew to get 
first aid equipment.  The ship’s carpenter remained with the bosun.  The chief officer  went to 
the ship’s office and  called the master to report the accident and request a helicopter 
evacuation.  
3.2.10.  At about 1730 , the helicopter paramedic was winched on board and confirmed that the bosun 
was deceased.  The New Legend Pearl  continued on  passage  to Marsden Point.

 3.3.  The crew  
3.3.1.  At the time of the accident there were 24 crew on board  the New Legend Pearl .  The minimum 
crew required by the safe manning certificate was 14.  All of the crew originated  from the 
People’s Republic of China.  
3.3.2.  The master  had commenced his seagoing career  in 1993 and gained his master’s certificate of 
competency in 2008 .  This qualification  was issued under the provisions of the International 
Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978, 
(STCW  Convention ), as amended .  He had been sailing in the rank of master since 2009  and 
the New Legend Pearl  was the first bulk carrier he had sailed on .  Prior to joining the vessel  he 
had spent one day at the company’s office be ing introduced to the company’s  safety 
management  system .  A copy of the safety management system  had been sent to him  for 
reading before  he joined the New Legend Pearl on 18 August 2016.  
3.3.3.  The chief officer  had been at sea since 2006 and had a chief mate’s certificate of competency  
issued  under the provisions of the STCW Convention  in September 2015 .  The contract on 
board  the New Legend Pearl  was his first appointment  as chief officer .  He had completed his 
previous contract as a chief officer  under  training and joined the New Legend Pearl  on 2 March 
2016.  
3.3.4.  The bosun was 51 years old and had worked at sea for  more than  30 years.  He was the eldest 
crew member and he was well respected by the c rew as an experienced seafarer.   He had been 
found fully fit for sea service on 23 February 2016 and joined  the New Legend Pearl on 26 
February 2016.  
3.4.  The cranes  
3.4.1.  The cranes were subject to an inspection regime carried out in accordance with the 
International Labour Organization’s  Occupational Safety and Health (Dock Work) Convention, 
1979  (No. 152), which requires  specific tests and examinations of a ship’s lifting  appliances.  
These requirements are written into New Zealand law through Maritime Rule Part 49 , Ships’ 
Lifting Appliances.  A foreign ship that is worki ng cargo in New Zealand territorial waters must 
be able to produce evidence  that the following tests and examinations  have been carried out  on 
every lifting appliance : 
 tested by a competent person15 prior to first use and after any substantial repair or 
alteration , using proof loads at a specified factor of the safe working load of the lifting 
appliance  
 re-testing of every lifting appliance at least once in every five -year period  
 thorough examination by a competent person at least once in every 12 -month period.  
These examination and test requirements are also reflected in the BV Rules for the Certification 
of Lifting Appliances  Onboard Ships and Offshore Units (October 2011).  
3.4.2.  The cranes on board  the New Legend Pearl had been most recently  tested  in June 2015 and an 
annual thorough examination had been  carried out in August 2016.  The tests and 
examinations had been  carried out  or witnessed  by the ship’s classification society, BV.  
  
                                                        
15 ‘Competent person’ means a person who is authorised to carry out testing and examination of ships’ lifting 
appliances and loose gear by the equipment manufacturers, a classification society, a testing establishment 
recognised by MNZ or another nation’s sh ipping administration.

 Final Report MO -2016 -205 3.5.  Risk identification and control  
3.5.1.  The Maritime Labour Convention 200616 was adopted by Panama and regulated by Executive 
Decree No.  86, 2013 .  The New Legend Pearl  was subject to t he requirements of this  decree , 
which  placed an obligation upon the owners : 
… to adopt effective safety and health policies and programs of work, including 
an evaluation of risk, as well as training and education of seafarers, with the 
purpose of preventin g work accidents, professional injuries or illnesses . 
3.5.2.  The operator’s Risk Identification, Assessment and Control Programme established the 
methods  of and requirements for risk identification, assessment and control . 
3.5.3.  On board, the master was responsible for implementing the risk control plan, training relevant 
personnel on risk perception and control, and providing feedback  to the operator about on -
board risks . 
3.5.4.  The operator’s risk control programme grouped risks into five categories ranging from 
unacceptable to ignorable.  
3.5.5.  Working at height without safety controls present ed an unacceptable risk and  required the 
application of controls to reduce the risk to a tolerable level.  A  risk assessment plan  was 
required, with special attention paid to specific work locations . 
3.5.6.  The operator expected the following factors to be taken into acco unt when selecting risk control  
measures:  
a) Where possible, elimination or complete elimination of the source risk;  
b) If elimination is not possible, the risk should be actively reduced;  
c) After all optional control measures have been considered, consideration 
may be given to personal protective equipment ; 
d) Consideration should be given to the establishment of contingency 
plans and crisis management, as well as the provision  of appropriate 
emergency equipment.  
3.5.7.  The operator also had specific instructions for working at height , which were applicable to any 
work performed at a point that could lead to a fall from two metres or more.  The following steps 
were required to be compl eted prior to working at height:  
 a detailed investigation of the work site  
 developing a safe operation plan based on the weather conditions and operating 
environment  
 explaining the safety procedures and precautions to the operating personnel  
 designating a person or persons responsible for organisation and supervision.  
3.6.  Safety harnesses  
3.6.1.  The safety harnesses provided to the crew were half -body harnesses that conformed with the 
Chinese mandatory national standard  for full -body harnesses.  This standard specified the 
requirements and inspection rules of personal fall -protection systems used in working at height 
for a total weight of no more than 100  kilograms .  The harnesses were supplied to the vessel 
with lanyard s and hook s already attached  (see Figure 5). 
                                                        
16 The Maritime Labour Convention 2006 is an international treaty adopted by the International Labour 
Organization.  It sets internationally agreed minimum standards for the health, safety and welfare of 
seafarers and came into force in August 2013.

3.6.2.  The lanyards were made of 14 -millimetre,  soft polyester, three -strand, right -hand -lay rope, eye -
spliced with three tucks.  There was no marking to indicate that the lanyard met the mandatory 
Chinese standard for lanyards used in personal fall -protection systems.  
3.6.3.  The hooks attached to the lanyards were mild -steel carbine hooks with manually lockable gate s.  
The hooks were not stamped with any identification, safe working load or indication of meeting 
the recommended Chinese standard for connectors used in personal fall -protection systems.  
3.6.4.  The crew working on top of the crane -house we re wearing safety harnesses as well as their 
normal personal protective equipment consisting of boiler suits, safety helmets and safety 
boots.  They secured their safety harness lanyards to strong points by clipping each  lanyard 
back onto itself (see Figur e 6).  There were no designated anchor points or safety wires 
specifically for the purpose of fall -protection.

 4 Analysis  
4.1 General  
4.1.1  Working at height on a ship at sea can be  dangerous , particularly on an open deck , due to  
unpredictable motion  and slippery surfaces caused by salt deposits and sea sp ray. 
4.1.2  The following analysis discuss es what happened  and why, and the significance of two safety 
issues:  
 the operator’s risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun working at height with 
an inadequate fall -protection system  
 the safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet 
industry good practice . 
4.2 The accident  
4.2.1  The bosun was working on top of number 2 crane’s jib when he fell eight  metres onto number 
2 hatch cover  (see Figure 4)  and suffered fatal injuries . 
4.2.2  He had climbe d onto the jib to clear a  snag ged cable sock , but with the lanyard of his safety 
harness  secured t o a luffing wire he was unable to  reach  the snag  below him . 
4.2.3  The bosun was seen to be in the process of moving the position of his safety harness lanyard 
hook when he lost his balance and fell.  There were no designated fall -prevention anch or 
points on the cranes , so the crew regularly secured their lanyards to convenient fixings or 
wires (see Figure 6).  The bosun had passed his lanyard around one of the crane’s luffing 
wires , then hooked it back onto itself . 
4.2.4  The practice of hooking a lanya rd back onto itself is not recommended unless the lanyard and 
hook have been specifically designed for that purpose .  This practice prevents the hook 
aligning with the force applied in the event of a fall, which means that it can also expose the 
gate of th e hook to side -loading forces.  The force required to roll out17 or burst out18 the gate 
of a hook is significantly less than the force the hook can withstand when pulled in direct 
alignment with the long axis of the hook.  
4.2.5  After the accident t he gate on the bosun’s safety harness  hook was found  bent sideways and 
it no longer married up with the end of the hook (see Figure 8).  The crew said that the safety 
equipment had been  checked before they started changing the wire and had been  found to be 
in a satisfactory condition.  If this damage  occurred during the fall, then the locking collar19 on 
the end of the gate should  have been damaged as the gate  was pulled sideways.  However, 
the locking collar was not damaged.  Therefore it is abou t as likely as not that when the  bosun 
fell he had either removed the locking collar in preparation for removing the hook from the 
upper luffing wire , or had clipped onto the lower luffing wire  but had yet to engage  the locking 
collar .  Any sideways force on the gate as the shock -load came onto the lanyard could  have  
cause d the gate to burst out and disconnect the harness from the anchor point.  
 
                                                        
17 Roll out is the unintentional disengagement of a non -locking safety hook during operation.  
18 Burst out is the forced, unintentional disengagement of a safety hook .  It is also possible with a locking 
safety hook if the hook is improperly attached or poorly maintained.  
19 A locking collar is a mechanism to lock and prevent the accidental opening of a safety hook.

4.3 Fall protection  
Safety issue – The operator’s  risk assessment process did not prevent the  bosun working at height with 
an inadequate f all-protect ion system.  
4.3.1  The operator’s Risk Identification, Assessment and Control Programme required risks to be 
identified, categorised a nd controlled.  On the day of the accident, a working -at-height risk 
assessment was carried out for working on number 2 crane (see Appendix 1) and a checklist 
was completed before the wire change commenced.   
4.3.2  The assessment sheet showed that the hazard of falling had been identified, the consequence 
of which was severe injury or death.  The actions or control measures to reduce the risk were 
discussion, training, supervision and inspection of personal protective equipment  before 
carrying out the wire change.  A personal fall -protection system includes the harness , an 
anchor point and a lanyard and hook .  All components must be fit for purpose and used 
correctly for it to be effective.  
4.3.3  The bosun’s actions to free the snagged  wire were impromptu and not properly planned.  The 
initial risk assessment had not distinguished between working at height on the crane -house 
and working out on the crane -jib.  Both were high -risk activities .  However , the chances of the 
bosun losing his balance and the need to transfer his securing point were greater out on the 
jib.  A task -specific risk assessment should  have identified that additional control measures 
were required.  
4.3.4  The location of the snag required an exposed traverse along the jib whe re there were fewer 
handholds, footholds and securing points.  The jib was also more susceptible to the vibration 
and movement of the vessel.  When the bosun lost his balance , the safety harness was the 
only thing  preventing him falling to the deck , but it  was not properly secured to a reliable 
strong point.  
4.3.5  The harness that the bosun was wearing had only  one lanyard .  The sample harness that  the 
Commission removed from the vessel  was fitted with two lanyards .  The two-lanyard type was 
gate 
locking collar  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -205 
<< Page 13 >>
 designed to provide security when the wearer is performing a task that require s them to move 
between  anchor  point s. 
4.3.6  The operator’s instructions for working at height s tated  that, ‘the harness must be attached to 
a reliably secured device right above the worker ’.  Howe ver, there were no designated fall-
arrest anchoring points on the crane -jibs.  This meant that the bosun or any other crew 
member  could only achieve an attachment by  pass ing the lanyard around a luffing wire and 
back on to itself .  The hook s on the harnesse s provided on board were  mild steel carbine 
hooks  with ma nually lockable gates.  The hooks were not stamped with any identification, safe 
working load or indication of meeting the recommended Chinese standard for connectors 
used in personal fall -protection  systems.  They were  not of a type  suitable for  looping around 
an attachment point and back onto th e lanyard .  They  were not therefore suitable for us e 
when changing a wire or any other task requiring the crew to work out on the crane -jibs. 
4.3.7  A bulk c arrier with its own cranes will, from time to time, require new crane wires to be fitted .  
This was not the first time that a wire and sock arrangement had become snagged  on a cross -
beam  during this type of operation .  A good risk assessment should have identifie d the need  
either  to provide single securing points designed for the safety harnesses on board, or for the 
provision of harnesses with clip s suitable for securing back on to themselves  in the way the 
bosun rigged his harness.  Equally, a good risk assessmen t should have identified the possible 
need to change securing points, and mitigated that risk by requiring a harness with dual 
securing lanyards.   Either measure could have prevented the accident . 
4.4 The decision to change the crane wire on passage  
4.4.1  The vessel ’s schedule for testing and inspecti ng lifting appliances was up  to date and the 
cranes had been surveyed by BV in order to confirm compliance with the I nternational Labour 
Organization’s  convention No. 152.   When the stevedores at Bluff found numerous broken 
strands in the hoisting wires on number s 2 and 4 cranes, they were right to question their 
condition  and to not use the cranes . 
4.4.2  The crew agreed that the wires needed replacing , and the  decision was made to change the 
hoisting wire on number 2 crane while the vessel was on passage from Bluff to Marsden Point.  
The intention was to have all of the vessel’s cranes rigged with the best wires available on 
board . 
4.4.3  However , there were no  more new wires on board , so the crew used the  damaged wire that 
had been  removed from number 4 crane.  The rules of BV  required the crane to undergo a 
load test if a used wire was installed on the crane .  Therefore,  number 2 crane would  have to 
have remained out of service at Mars den Point until an approved surveyor attend ed and 
witnessed a load test.  
4.4.4  It is of concern that the crew were considering placing a used wire that had previously been 
considered not fit for purpose onto a crane.  There was no logical reason for doing so, except if 
they intended to use the crane with the old wire at subsequent ports outside New Zealand . 
4.4.5  Had a  new wire been sourced  and fitted , number 2 crane could have been operational before 
the New Legend Pearl  left Marsden Point without the need for a loa d test.   The wire change 
could have been carried out alongside using  a personnel cage for work ing at height , and the 
risk substantially reduced . 
4.5 Safe ty management and s afety culture  
Safety issue – The safe ty management system and the underlying safety cult ure on board did not meet 
industry good practice.  
4.5.1  The New Legend Pearl  had a safety management system  that fulfilled the occupational health 
and safety requirements of its flag state, Panama.  
4.5.2  However, a safety  management system is only effective if it is b eing followed by the crew at all 
levels.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -205 4.5.3  An effective safety management system  must have  operational procedures and instructions 
for high -risk work.  Working at height in different areas of a vessel will present different risks  
not covered by standard procedures.  
4.5.4  The operator’s working -at-height instructions required a designated person to provide 
supervision and guidance to workers in ‘the correct use of harnesses, safety lanyards, helmets 
and other protective equipment ’.  The designated person  was in this case the chief officer .  
However, there was  also a duty of care imparted on every crew member, at every rank, to look 
out for their own safety and the safety of others .   
4.5.5  Working at height w ithout wearing fall-protection  equip ment had been observed on board on 
two occasions when  the vessel was in Bluf f.  The second occasion was in spite of the crew  
having been previously warned  against the poor practice . 
4.5.6  The continued practice  by the crew of work ing at height with so few safeguards suggests that 
they did not fully understand fall -preven tion systems or the dangers associated with working at 
height .  It is an indication that it was  normal procedure to work at height in an unsafe manner .  
The unsafe pra ctices for working at height , the failure to ensure  that the safety equipment was 
fit for the proposed task  of changing a crane wire at sea , and the  acceptance of installing a 
used crane wire that had already been rejected as substandard by the stevedores in Bluff 
were all indications of a poor safety culture  on board  the New Legend Pearl .   
4.5.7  The Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seafarers , issued by the United Kingdom 
Maritime and Coastguard Agency , describes a good safety culture as:  
… one where safety is an integral part of everything that is planned, discussed, 
done and documented. With good safety culture everyone in the company thinks 
about safety and new ways of improving it as a matter of course.  They are 
constantly on the lookout for any u nsafe acts or unsafe conditions, look out for 
each other, intervene to prevent accidents and incidents, actively share good 
ideas and always seek to improve.  
4.5.8  A recommendation has been made to the flag state Panama to seek improvement s in the 
operator’s imp lementation of its safety management system on board its vessels, including 
the underlying safety culture.

 5 Findings  
5.1 The bosun either slipped or lost his balance and fell eight met res to the deck below when 
transferring the securing hook for his safety harness from one point to another . 
5.2 The gate on the safety harness hook was fitted with a locking collar to prevent  the inadvertent 
release of the hook.  It was about as likely as not that the locking collar was not engaged when 
the bosun fell .  
5.3 The bosun’s  safety harness was not fit for the task he was perfo rming.  The hoo k was not 
designed to be  secured in the manner  that it was .  The harness should have had a more 
robust hook and lanyard arrangement, designed to be tied back on itself and with dual 
lanyar ds to enable safe transfer s between securing points . 
5.4 The risk assessment conducted prior to the crew starting the wire replacement on crane 
number 2 did not fulfil the requirements of the operator’s safety management system, 
because it did not adequately i dentify and manage the risks associated with the task . 
5.5 The repeat ed failures  of the crew to comply with  safe working practices when working at 
height and the acceptance of using a substandard wire on a working crane are indications of a 
poor safe ty culture  on board the New Lege nd Pearl .

 7 Safety actions  
General  
7.1 The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commi ssion issuing a recommendation.  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2 Safety actions taken by the operator included a review of the safety management system.  
This review identified that the safety management system was not u nderstood or seriously 
implemented on board  the New Legend Pearl .  Safety consciousness and safety management 
training on board were  found to be inadequate.  The following preventive measures were 
pledged:  
 the accident would be reported to the company and crew and all vessels would be required 
to emphasise the harm to family and other crew members caused by this accident  
 the company would strengthen the monitoring and management of vessels by regular crew 
safety inspections and crew safety awareness trainin g in respect of ‘safety first’  
 supervision of masters’ efforts to train their crews on the safety management system  
 strengthening training in key operations and improving the professional qualities of the 
crew.  ‘We shall ensure that crew members follow th e requirements of the safety 
management system and carry out their work on vessels in a satisfactory manner, with 
crew safety always our top priority ’. 
7.3 A circular was sent out to inform the fleet of the accident and to remind all vessels to 
constantly atta ch great importance to the work safety of crews.  During the vessel’s first port 
call in China after the accident , the designated person ashore and the crew company manager 
addressed the crew and reiterate d the importance of personal safety on board.  
Safet y actions addressing other safety issues  
7.4 None identified.

 Final Report MO -2016 -205 8 Recommendation  
General  
8.1 The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , a recommendation ha s been issued to  the gen eral director of the  
Panama Maritime Authority . 
8.2 In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that th is recommendation is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurrin g in the future.  
Recommendation   
8.3 The continued practice by the crew of work ing at height with so few safeguards suggests that 
they did not fully understand fall -prevention systems or the dangers associated with working at 
height.  It is an indication that it was normal procedure to work at height in an unsafe manner.  
The unsafe practices for working at height , the failure to ensure  that the safety equipment was 
fit for the proposed task of changing a crane wire at sea , and the acceptance of installing a 
used crane wire that had already been rejected as substandard by the stevedores in Bluff 
were all indications of a poor safety culture on board the New Legend Pearl . 
8.3.1  On 27 September 2017 , the Commission recommended that the  general director of the 
Panama Maritime Authority  seek improvement s in the operator’s  implementation  of its safety 
management  system  on board its vessels, including the underlying safety culture .  (027/17)  
On 3 November 2017, Panama Maritime Authority  replied:  
Concerning the recommendation made to our Administration in the report into the 
fatality on board the M/V NEW LEGEND PEARL, we are glad to inform you that we 
proceeded accordingly and required from the operator a brief summary of the 
actions taken by them to avoid similar accidents in the future highlighting safety 
culture improvement and the corresponding evidence (documentation gathered from 
meetings, fleet circulars, forms, etc.) that proves that such actions are being fully 
implemented.  
We are sure tha t the operator will be attending our request on the next days and will 
submit to this office the required evidence.

 9 Key l essons  
9.1 Workin g at height is a risky activity and all crew should use suitable safety harness es that are 
fit for the intended task . 
9.2 Work ing at height is a risky activity that must be properly managed using a formal risk 
assessment methodology . 
9.3 Attaching a safety harness by passing it through or around the securing point and back onto 
the lanyard is a dangerous practice that can result in inadvertent release unless the lanyard 
and hook are designed for that purpose .
