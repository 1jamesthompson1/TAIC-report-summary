- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The bosun's fall was directly related to the inadequate adherence to safety procedures, as evidenced by the use of an improper fall-protection system. The report states that "the operator's risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun working at height with an inadequate fall-protection system" (4.3, 4.3.6). Additionally, the crew regularly secured their lanyards to convenient fixings or wires instead of designated fall-prevention anchor points (4.2.3), and the hooks on the harnesses were not suitable for the task (4.3.6).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The organizational safety culture on board the New Legend Pearl was lacking, as indicated by the crew's repeated failures to comply with safe working practices and the acceptance of using a substandard wire on a working crane (5.5). The report also notes that the safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice (4.1.2, 4.5).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The bosun's actions to free the snagged wire were impromptu and not properly planned, suggesting a lack of adequate training and competency in performing high-risk tasks such as working at height (4.3.3). The report also implies that the crew did not fully understand fall-prevention systems or the dangers associated with working at height (4.5.6).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The risk assessment conducted prior to the wire replacement did not adequately identify and manage the risks associated with the task, particularly the differences in risk between working on the crane-house and the crane-jib (4.3.3, 4.4). This indicates a failure in risk management and analysis.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task he was performing, and the hook was not designed to be secured in the manner that it was (5.3). This suggests a lack of training and familiarity with the equipment, which contributed to the accident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There was a failure in crew resource management, as the designated person, the chief officer, did not provide adequate supervision and guidance in the correct use of harnesses and safety equipment (4.5.4). Additionally, there was a lack of collective responsibility among the crew members to ensure safety (4.5.4).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Although not directly cited as a cause of the accident, the report mentions that the safety equipment had been checked and found to be in a satisfactory condition before the task (4.2.5). However, the hook's unsuitability for the task suggests that the maintenance and inspection regimes may not have been thorough enough to identify equipment not fit for purpose (4.3.6).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The vessel's safety management system fulfilled the occupational health and safety requirements of its flag state, Panama, but the system's effectiveness depends on it being followed by the crew (4.5.1, 4.5.2). The lack of compliance with good industry practices suggests issues with regulatory oversight and compliance.
