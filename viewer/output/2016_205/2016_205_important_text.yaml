  \ ship at sea can be  dangerous , particularly on an open deck , due to  \nunpredictable\
  \ motion  and slippery surfaces caused by salt deposits and sea sp ray. \n4.1.2\
  \  The following analysis discuss es what happened  and why, and the significance\
  \ of two safety \nissues:  \n\uF0B7 the operator's risk assessment process did not\
  \ prevent the bosun working at height with \nan inadequate fall -protection system\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board\
  \ did not meet \nindustry good practice . \n4.2 The accident  \n4.2.1  The bosun\
  \ was working on top of number 2 crane's jib when he fell eight  metres onto number\
  \ \n2 hatch cover  (see Figure 4)  and suffered fatal injuries . \n4.2.2  He had\
  \ climbe d onto the jib to clear a  snag ged cable sock , but with the lanyard of\
  \ his safety \nharness  secured t o a luffing wire he was unable to  reach  the\
  \ snag  below him . \n4.2.3  The bosun was seen to be in the process of moving the\
  \ position of his safety harness lanyard \nhook when he lost his balance and fell.\
  \  There were no designated fall -prevention anch or \npoints on the cranes , so\
  \ the crew regularly secured their lanyards to convenient fixings or \nwires (see\
  \ Figure 6).  The bosun had passed his lanyard around one of the crane's luffing\
  \ \nwires , then hooked it back onto itself . \n4.2.4  The practice of hooking a\
  \ lanya rd back onto itself is not recommended unless the lanyard and \nhook have\
  \ been specifically designed for that purpose .  This practice prevents the hook\
  \ \naligning with the force applied in the event of a fall, which means that it\
  \ can also expose the \ngate of th e hook to side -loading forces.  The force required\
  \ to roll out17 or burst out18 the gate \nof a hook is significantly less than the\
  \ force the hook can withstand when pulled in direct \nalignment with the long axis\
  \ of the hook.  \n4.2.5  After the accident t he gate on the bosun's safety harness\
  \  hook was found  bent sideways and \nit no longer married up with the end of the\
  \ hook (see Figure 8).  The crew said that the safety \nequipment had been  checked\
  \ before they started changing the wire and had been  found to be \nin a satisfactory\
  \ condition.  If this damage  occurred during the fall, then the locking collar19\
  \ on \nthe end of the gate should  have been damaged as the gate  was pulled sideways.\
  \  However, \nthe locking collar was not damaged.  Therefore it is abou t as likely\
  \ as not that when the  bosun \nfell he had either removed the locking collar in\
  \ preparation for removing the hook from the \nupper luffing wire , or had clipped\
  \ onto the lower luffing wire  but had yet to engage  the locking \ncollar .  Any\
  \ sideways force on the gate as the shock -load came onto the lanyard could  have\
  \  \ncause d the gate to burst out and disconnect the harness from the anchor point.\
  \  \n \n                                                        \n17 Roll out is\
  \ the unintentional disengagement of a non -locking safety hook during operation.\
  \  \n18 Burst out is the forced, unintentional disengagement of a safety hook .\
  \  It is also possible with a locking \nsafety hook if the hook is improperly attached\
  \ or poorly maintained.  \n19 A locking collar is a mechanism to lock and prevent\
  \ the accidental opening of a safety hook.  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report MO\
  \ -2016 -205  \nFigure 8  \nThe damaged safety hook  \n4.3 Fall protection  \nSafety\
  \ issue - The operator's  risk assessment process did not prevent the  bosun working\
  \ at height with \nan inadequate f all-protect ion system.  \n4.3.1  The operator's\
  \ Risk Identification, Assessment and Control Programme required risks to be \n\
  identified, categorised a nd controlled.  On the day of the accident, a working\
  \ -at-height risk \nassessment was carried out for working on number 2 crane (see\
  \ Appendix 1) and a checklist \nwas completed before the wire change commenced.\
  \   \n4.3.2  The assessment sheet showed that the hazard of falling had been identified,\
  \ the consequence \nof which was severe injury or death.  The actions or control\
  \ measures to reduce the risk were \ndiscussion, training, supervision and inspection\
  \ of personal protective equipment  before \ncarrying out the wire change.  A personal\
  \ fall -protection system includes the harness , an \nanchor point and a lanyard\
  \ and hook .  All components must be fit for purpose and used \ncorrectly for it\
  \ to be effective.  \n4.3.3  The bosun's actions to free the snagged  wire were\
  \ impromptu and not properly planned.  The \ninitial risk assessment had not distinguished\
  \ between working at height on the crane -house \nand working out on the crane -jib.\
  \  Both were high -risk activities .  However , the chances of the \nbosun losing\
  \ his balance and the need to transfer his securing point were greater out on the\
  \ \njib.  A task -specific risk assessment should  have identified that additional\
  \ control measures \nwere required.  \n4.3.4  The location of the snag required\
  \ an exposed traverse along the jib whe re there were fewer \nhandholds, footholds\
  \ and securing points.  The jib was also more susceptible to the vibration \nand\
  \ movement of the vessel.  When the bosun lost his balance , the safety harness\
  \ was the \nonly thing  preventing him falling to the deck , but it  was not properly\
  \ secured to a reliable \nstrong point.  \n4.3.5  The harness that the bosun was\
  \ wearing had only  one lanyard .  The sample harness that  the \nCommission removed\
  \ from the vessel  was fitted with two lanyards .  The two-lanyard type was \ngate\
  \ \nlocking collar  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -205 \n<< Page 13 >>\n designed to\
  \ provide security when the wearer is performing a task that require s them to move\
  \ \nbetween  anchor  point s. \n4.3.6  The operator's instructions for working at\
  \ height s tated  that, 'the harness must be attached to \na reliably secured device\
  \ right above the worker '.  Howe ver, there were no designated fall-\narrest anchoring\
  \ points on the crane -jibs.  This meant that the bosun or any other crew \nmember\
  \  could only achieve an attachment by  pass ing the lanyard around a luffing wire\
  \ and \nback on to itself .  The hook s on the harnesse s provided on board were\
  \  mild steel carbine \nhooks  with ma nually lockable gates.  The hooks were not\
  \ stamped with any identification, safe \nworking load or indication of meeting\
  \ the recommended Chinese standard for connectors \nused in personal fall -protection\
  \  systems.  They were  not of a type  suitable for  looping around \nan attachment\
  \ point and back onto th e lanyard .  They  were not therefore suitable for us e\
  \ \nwhen changing a wire or any other task requiring the crew to work out on the\
  \ crane -jibs. \n4.3.7  A bulk c arrier with its own cranes will, from time to time,\
  \ require new crane wires to be fitted .  \nThis was not the first time that a wire\
  \ and sock arrangement had become snagged  on a cross -\nbeam  during this type\
  \ of operation .  A good risk assessment should have identifie d the need  \neither\
  \  to provide single securing points designed for the safety harnesses on board,\
  \ or for the \nprovision of harnesses with clip s suitable for securing back on\
  \ to themselves  in the way the \nbosun rigged his harness.  Equally, a good risk\
  \ assessmen t should have identified the possible \nneed to change securing points,\
  \ and mitigated that risk by requiring a harness with dual \nsecuring lanyards.\
  \   Either measure could have prevented the accident . \n4.4 The decision to change\
  \ the crane wire on passage  \n4.4.1  The vessel 's schedule for testing and inspecti\
  \ ng lifting appliances was up  to date and the \ncranes had been surveyed by BV\
  \ in order to confirm compliance with the I nternational Labour \nOrganization's\
  \  convention No. 152.   When the stevedores at Bluff found numerous broken \nstrands\
  \ in the hoisting wires on number s 2 and 4 cranes, they were right to question\
  \ their \ncondition  and to not use the cranes . \n4.4.2  The crew agreed that the\
  \ wires needed replacing , and the  decision was made to change the \nhoisting wire\
  \ on number 2 crane while the vessel was on passage from Bluff to Marsden Point.\
  \  \nThe intention was to have all of the vessel's cranes rigged with the best wires\
  \ available on \nboard . \n4.4.3  However , there were no  more new wires on board\
  \ , so the crew used the  damaged wire that \nhad been  removed from number 4 crane.\
  \  The rules of BV  required the crane to undergo a \nload test if a used wire was\
  \ installed on the crane .  Therefore,  number 2 crane would  have to \nhave remained\
  \ out of service at Mars den Point until an approved surveyor attend ed and \nwitnessed\
  \ a load test.  \n4.4.4  It is of concern that the crew were considering placing\
  \ a used wire that had previously been \nconsidered not fit for purpose onto a crane.\
  \  There was no logical reason for doing so, except if \nthey intended to use the\
  \ crane with the old wire at subsequent ports outside New Zealand . \n4.4.5  Had\
  \ a  new wire been sourced  and fitted , number 2 crane could have been operational\
  \ before \nthe New Legend Pearl  left Marsden Point without the need for a loa d\
  \ test.   The wire change \ncould have been carried out alongside using  a personnel\
  \ cage for work ing at height , and the \nrisk substantially reduced . \n4.5 Safe\
  \ ty management and s afety culture  \nSafety issue - The safe ty management system\
  \ and the underlying safety cult ure on board did not meet \nindustry good practice.\
  \  \n4.5.1  The New Legend Pearl  had a safety management system  that fulfilled\
  \ the occupational health \nand safety requirements of its flag state, Panama. \
  \ \n4.5.2  However, a safety  management system is only effective if it is b eing\
  \ followed by the crew at all \nlevels.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2016\
  \ -205 4.5.3  An effective safety management system  must have  operational procedures\
  \ and instructions \nfor high -risk work.  Working at height in different areas\
  \ of a vessel will present different risks  \nnot covered by standard procedures.\
  \  \n4.5.4  The operator's working -at-height instructions required a designated\
  \ person to provide \nsupervision and guidance to workers in 'the correct use of\
  \ harnesses, safety lanyards, helmets \nand other protective equipment '.  The designated\
  \ person  was in this case the chief officer .  \nHowever, there was  also a duty\
  \ of care imparted on every crew member, at every rank, to look \nout for their\
  \ own safety and the safety of others .   \n4.5.5  Working at height w ithout wearing\
  \ fall-protection  equip ment had been observed on board on \ntwo occasions when\
  \  the vessel was in Bluf f.  The second occasion was in spite of the crew  \nhaving\
  \ been previously warned  against the poor practice . \n4.5.6  The continued practice\
  \  by the crew of work ing at height with so few safeguards suggests that \nthey\
  \ did not fully understand fall -preven tion systems or the dangers associated with\
  \ working at \nheight .  It is an indication that it was  normal procedure to work\
  \ at height in an unsafe manner .  \nThe unsafe pra ctices for working at height\
  \ , the failure to ensure  that the safety equipment was \nfit for the proposed\
  \ task  of changing a crane wire at sea , and the  acceptance of installing a \n\
  used crane wire that had already been rejected as substandard by the stevedores\
  \ in Bluff \nwere all indications of a poor safety culture  on board  the New Legend\
  \ Pearl .   \n4.5.7  The Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seafarers ,\
  \ issued by the United Kingdom \nMaritime and Coastguard Agency , describes a good\
  \ safety culture as:  \n\u2026 one where safety is an integral part of everything\
  \ that is planned, discussed, \ndone and documented. With good safety culture everyone\
  \ in the company thinks \nabout safety and new ways of improving it as a matter\
  \ of course.  They are \nconstantly on the lookout for any u nsafe acts or unsafe\
  \ conditions, look out for \neach other, intervene to prevent accidents and incidents,\
  \ actively share good \nideas and always seek to improve.  \n4.5.8  A recommendation\
  \ has been made to the flag state Panama to seek improvement s in the \noperator's\
  \ imp lementation of its safety management system on board its vessels, including\
  \ \nthe underlying safety culture.  \n \n  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -205 \n<<\
  \ Page 15 >>\n 5 Findings  \n5.1 The bosun either slipped or lost his balance and\
  \ fell eight met res to the deck below when \ntransferring the securing hook for\
  \ his safety harness from one point to another . \n5.2 The gate on the safety harness\
  \ hook was fitted with a locking collar to prevent  the inadvertent \nrelease of\
  \ the hook.  It was about as likely as not that the locking collar was not engaged\
  \ when \nthe bosun fell .  \n5.3 The bosun's  safety harness was not fit for the\
  \ task he was perfo rming.  The hoo k was not \ndesigned to be  secured in the manner\
  \  that it was .  The harness should have had a more \nrobust hook and lanyard arrangement,\
  \ designed to be tied back on itself and with dual \nlanyar ds to enable safe transfer\
  \ s between securing points . \n5.4 The risk assessment conducted prior to the crew\
  \ starting the wire replacement on crane \nnumber 2 did not fulfil the requirements\
  \ of the operator's safety management system, \nbecause it did not adequately i\
  \ dentify and manage the risks associated with the task . \n5.5 The repeat ed failures\
  \  of the crew to comply with  safe working practices when working at \nheight and\
  \ the acceptance of using a substandard wire on a working crane are indications\
  \ of a \npoor safe ty culture  on board the New Lege nd Pearl .  \n \n  \n\n<< Page\
