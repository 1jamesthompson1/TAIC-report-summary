- name: Inadequate Fall-Protection System
  explanation: The inadequate fall-protection system is a central safety theme in this accident. The bosun was working at height with an insufficient fall-protection system, which directly contributed to the fatal outcome. The operator's risk assessment process failed to prevent the bosun from working at height with this inadequate system, as "the operator's risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun working at height with an inadequate fall-protection system" (4.3). Furthermore, the bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task, as "the bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task he was performing" (5.3), and the harness should have had a more robust hook and lanyard arrangement, designed to be tied back on itself and with dual lanyards to enable safe transfers between securing points (5.3).
- name: Lack of Proper Risk Assessment
  explanation: The lack of a proper risk assessment is another significant safety theme. The initial risk assessment did not adequately distinguish between the different risks associated with working at various heights on the ship, particularly on the crane-jib where the accident occurred. The report states that "the initial risk assessment had not distinguished between working at height on the crane-house and working out on the crane-jib" (4.3.3). A task-specific risk assessment should have identified that additional control measures were required (4.3.3), and the risk assessment conducted prior to the wire replacement did not fulfill the requirements of the operator's safety management system because it did not adequately identify and manage the risks associated with the task (5.4).
- name: Inadequate Safety Management and Culture
  explanation: Inadequate safety management and culture aboard the vessel is a critical safety theme. The safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice, as evidenced by the crew's repeated failures to comply with safe working practices when working at height (5.5). The report highlights that "the safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice" (4.1.2). This poor safety culture is further illustrated by the fact that working at height without wearing fall-protection equipment had been observed on board on two occasions (4.5.5), and the crew did not fully understand fall-prevention systems or the dangers associated with working at height (4.5.6).
- name: Improper Use of Safety Equipment
  explanation: The improper use of safety equipment is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The bosun's safety harness hook was not designed to be secured in the manner that it was, and the practice of hooking a lanyard back onto itself is not recommended unless the lanyard and hook have been specifically designed for that purpose (4.2.4). The report indicates that "the bosun was seen to be in the process of moving the position of his safety harness lanyard hook when he lost his balance and fell" (4.2.3), and "the practice of hooking a lanyard back onto itself is not recommended" (4.2.4). This misuse of equipment was a direct factor in the accident.
- name: Inadequate Equipment and Lack of Anchor Points
  explanation: The inadequacy of the equipment provided and the lack of proper anchor points for fall prevention are safety themes relevant to this accident. The bosun had to secure his lanyard to a luffing wire due to the absence of designated fall-prevention anchor points on the cranes (4.2.3). The hooks on the harnesses provided on board were not suitable for looping around an attachment point and back onto the lanyard (4.3.6). This lack of proper equipment and anchor points contributed to the inability to secure the safety harness properly, leading to the accident.
- name: Decision-Making and Planning Deficiencies
  explanation: Decision-making and planning deficiencies are evident in the decision to change the crane wire while the vessel was on passage, which introduced unnecessary risks. The crew's decision to replace the hoisting wire on number 2 crane during the passage from Bluff to Marsden Point, using a damaged wire that had been removed from another crane, was questionable and indicative of poor planning (4.4.2-4.4.4). The report states that "the decision was made to change the hoisting wire on number 2 crane while the vessel was on passage" (4.4.2), and "it is of concern that the crew were considering placing a used wire that had previously been considered not fit for purpose onto a crane" (4.4.4). This decision-making process did not adequately consider the safety implications of such actions.
