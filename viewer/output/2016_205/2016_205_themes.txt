Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Working at height without proper fall protection: The bosun was working at height without an adequate fall-protection system, which led to the fatal accident. The unpredictable motion and slippery surfaces on the open deck further increased the danger.

2. Inadequate risk assessment and safety management: The operator's risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun from working at height with an inadequate fall-protection system. The safety management system and safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice, leading to a lack of proper procedures and instructions for high-risk work.

3. Poor safety culture: The crew demonstrated a poor safety culture by repeatedly working at height without proper safeguards and by accepting the use of a substandard wire on a working crane. This indicates a lack of understanding of fall-prevention systems and a normal procedure of working at height in an unsafe manner.
