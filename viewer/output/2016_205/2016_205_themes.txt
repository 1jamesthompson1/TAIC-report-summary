Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Working at height without proper fall protection: The bosun was working at height without an adequate fall-protection system, which led to the fatal accident. The unpredictable motion and slippery surfaces on the open deck further increased the danger.

2. Inadequate risk assessment and safety management: The operator's risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun from working at height with an inadequate fall-protection system. The safety management system and safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice, leading to a lack of proper procedures and instructions for high-risk work.

3. Poor safety culture: The crew demonstrated a poor safety culture by repeatedly working at height without proper safeguards and by accepting the use of a substandard wire on a working crane. This indicates a lack of understanding of fall-prevention systems and a disregard for safety protocols.

4. Inappropriate equipment and procedures: The bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task he was performing, with a hook that was not designed to be secured in the manner it was. The crew also used mild steel carbine hooks that were not suitable for looping around an attachment point and back onto the lanyard.

5. Lack of proper training and supervision: The crew's actions and failures suggest a lack of understanding of fall-prevention systems and the dangers associated with working at height. The designated person for supervision and guidance did not effectively ensure the correct use of safety equipment.

6. Failure to source appropriate equipment: The crew used a damaged wire that had been previously considered not fit for purpose, instead of sourcing a new wire. This decision was not logical and indicated a lack of consideration for safety.

Overall, the themes/causes present in this report are working at height without proper fall protection, inadequate risk assessment and safety management, poor safety culture, inappropriate equipment and procedures, lack of proper training and supervision, and failure to source appropriate equipment.
