2015_001,018/17,"Skydive Taupo did not equip its parachute drop pilots with lifejackets and was not required to do so, because its flights from TaupÅ aerodrome, which used the TaupÅ aerodrome parachute landing area, remained within gliding distance of land at all times. This accident illustrated how that scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane, or bale out and drift to a water landing.

Therefore the Commission is recommending that the Chief Executive of Skydive Taupo investigate options for equipping their parachute drop pilots with effective flotation devices.",
