  \  \n4.1.1.  A fractured compressor turbine blade caused the engine failure .  The\
  \ fracture originated in a \nfatigue crack in the trailing edge of the blade.  The\
  \ blade , one of a set of overhauled blades , \nhad been operated for less than\
  \ half the time before the next inspection was due in \naccordance with Service\
  \ Bulletin 1403 (see paragraph 3.3.14) . \n4.1.2.  The engine failure occurred at\
  \ a low height and over terrain that did not offer favourable \noption s for a forced\
  \ la nding.  As all of the occupants were wearing  parachutes, bal ing out \nwas\
  \ the most appropriate action to take .  The  experience of  the tandem masters\
  \ con tributed \nto a successful  evacuation . \n4.1.3.  The pilot  unwittingly\
  \ jeopardised the evacuation by baling out  through  his cockpit  window \nrather\
  \ than  from the cabin rear door, and by deploying his parachute immediately.  His\
  \ \nactions were very likely d ue to  natural anxiety and also, in part , to inadequate\
  \ training in \nemergency procedures by the operator.  \nSafety issu es \n4.1.4.\
  \  Turbine engines, in general, are extremely reliable, which has led to their acceptance\
  \ and \napproval for an increasing number of commercial single -engine -aircraft\
  \ operations.  \nHowever, a turbine blade failure will usually cause other  blade\
  \ failures on th at turbine dis k.  \nBlade fragments will destroy downstream turbine\
  \ stages, leading to total engine failure.  \nTherefore turbine reliability is \
  \ important for  aviation safety.  \n4.1.5.  The following safety issues were identified\
  \ during this in quiry : \n\uF0B7 the measurement  specifications for overhauled\
  \  compressor turbine blades that had \nbeen through a strip and recoat  repair\
  \ process were not exactly the same  as those \nfor new blades .  Blades that had\
  \ been through that repair process , without \nverification of critical dimension\
  \ s, might  fail before the next 3 ,000-hour  inspection  \n\uF0B7 when aircraft\
  \ maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for \nContinuing Airworthiness\
  \  for a task, perhaps  because  they are very familiar with  the \nbasic task and\
  \ do not know that  the task documentation has changed, safety might  \nbe compromised\
  \  \n\uF0B7 parachute drop pilot s were not required to wear lifejacket s or flotation\
  \ device s if \ntheir flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of\
  \ land.  That scenario  \ndownplayed  the possibility of a  pilot having to ditch\
  \ an aeroplane or having to  use \nthe e mergency parachute  when over or near water\
  \ . \n4.2. Premature failure of t he compressor turbine blade  \nSafety issue :\
  \  The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blad es \nthat\
  \ had been through a strip and recoat  repair process were not exactly the same\
  \  as those \nfor new blades .  Blades that had been through that repair process\
  \ , without verification of \ncritical dimensions, might  fail before the next 3\
  \ ,000-hour inspection . \n4.2.1.  The examination of the engine by P&WC identified\
  \ the compressor turbine blade that had \nfractured first and caused  the engine\
  \ failure.  The blade fracture surface had distinct fatigue \nand overload zones.\
  \  Due to the damage, only approximate m easurement s of the blade \ndimensions\
  \ in the fatigue zone could be performed.  These showed  that the radius  of the\
  \  \ntrailing edge , after allowing for the thermal coating applied to  blades,\
  \  was less than that \nspecifi ed for a new blade . \n4.2.2.  Measurements were\
  \ also taken of t he remnants of six other  overhauled blades and one of \nthe two\
  \ blades that had been new when installed  in May 2013 .  One of the overhauled\
  \ \nblades  was under -size in trailing edge thickness and radius  (see Figure 5)\
  \ , and two more \n  \nFinal Report AO -2015 -001 \n<< Page 15 >>\n were at the\
  \ minimum limit for on e or o ther dimension.  The dimensions of the blade  that\
  \ \nwas new when installed in May 2013 met the required specifications.  \n \nFigure\
  \ 5 \nMicroscopic image of the trailing edge cross -section of another sampled \
  \ blade  \n(With  measurements of trailing edge thickness and radius.  Source: P&WC\
  \ Service Investigation Report)  \n4.2.3.  During the overhaul, the blade had required\
  \ repair  in accordance with the P&WC -approved \nsupplier process MPP1, based on\
  \ document  725009 -SRR-001.  This document did not \nrequire the measurement of\
  \ repaired blades in  all of the dimension s specifi ed by P&WC for \nthe acceptance\
  \ of new blades , although  there had always been a verification of the \nminimum\
  \ trailing edge thickness  for blades that had been through a strip an d recoat\
  \ \nprocess . \n4.2.4.  Engine turbine blades must endure very high temperatures\
  \ and centrifugal loads ; therefore \nthe blades are manufactured to strict specifications.\
  \  Under -size blades will erode or stretch, \nwhich can lead to their failing before\
  \  reaching the next inspection .  Of the eight compressor \nturbine blade remnants\
  \ sampled  from this set , two were under -size and another two were at \nthe minimum\
  \ size for a critical dimension.  \n4.2.5.  An operator will usually make a commercial\
  \ decision  on whether to install new or overhauled \nturbine blades.  However,\
  \ the use of overhauled components, or  the introduction of  an \nengine overhaul\
  \ extension programme like th is STC, could  introduce new risks for an \noperato\
  \ r.  It is a safety issue  that the specifi cations for compressor turbine blades\
  \ that had \nbeen through a strip and recoat process were not as well defined as\
  \ those for new blades , \nand that ov erhauled blades might fail to r each the\
  \ stated  inspection interval s.  The issue \nwas of particular importance to operators\
  \ of single -engine aircraft.  \n4.2.6.  P&WC noted that dimensional differences\
  \ could arise for blades that had been repaired \nduring overhaul: that is, had\
  \ been stripped, repaired and then recoated.  It submitted th at \nblade durability\
  \ after that process had been acceptable, as shown by [past] field experience .\
  \ \n4.2.7.  P&WC subsequently revised Repair Requirement Document 725009 -SRR-001,\
  \ for all of its \nPT6 engines, so that  the trailing edge thickness measurement\
  \  requirements match ed those \nfor new compressor turbine blades . \n4.2.8.  When\
  \  asked about the implications of this investigation for other engines that were\
  \ \npresently in service with overhauled compressor turbine blades , P&WC  replied\
  \  that further \nintervention would not improve fl eet reliability.  Its response\
  \ was , in part:  \nPratt & Whitney Canada has assessed the risk of further occurrences\
  \ of this \nnature on the basis of the number of events and the time accrued on\
  \ similarly \nrepaired components over the service history of the affec ted fleet.\
  \   Future risk \nof significant events related to fracture of under -dimensional,\
  \ recoat ed blades \nwas determined to be well within acceptable parameters (as\
  \ defined by \navailable Guidance Material).  Additional field intervention would\
  \ be deemed to \n\n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -001 be neither effective\
  \ nor warranted at this point with respect to measurably \nimproving fleet reliability.26\
  \ \n4.2.9.  The flight manual has operating limits for engine speed and temperature\
  \ , which  pilots must \nobserve in order to protect the engine from sudden or cumulative\
  \ damage that will shorten  \nthe lives of turbine  component s.  In general, the\
  \ higher the power settings, the shorter the \nturbine life.  The mission profile\
  \ review conducted by P&WC and Pacific Aerospace found \nthat skydiving operators\
  \ tended to have a higher frequency of operating cycles27 than was \noriginally\
  \ assumed, and that would also affect directly the lives of engine components. \
  \ \n4.2.10.  Approximately 15 months after the overhauled turbine module was installed,\
  \ the operator \nraised the take -off torque  setting  but retained the turbine\
  \ temperature limit .  Both settings \nremained at or below the flight manual limits.\
  \  The operator's engine handling procedure, \neven allowing for  the high frequency\
  \ of operatin g cycles in the skydiving role, would not have \naffected unduly the\
  \ durability of the compressor turbine blades  had all of the blades  \nconformed\
  \ to the correct specifications for acceptance after repair . \nFindings  \n1. The\
  \ first compressor turbine blade failed aft er a fatigue crack, which had \nbegun\
  \ at the trailing edge, propagated towards the leading edge .  The blade  \nfinally\
  \ fractured in tensile overload.  The separated blade fragment caused \nother blades\
  \ to fracture and the engine to stop.  \n2. The fatigue crack in the trailing edge\
  \ of the blade was likely initiated by the \ntrailing edge radius having been  below\
  \ the specification for a new blade.  \n3. The P&WC Repair Requirement Document\
  \ 725009 -SRR-001, at the time the \nblades were overhauled, had gener ic requirements\
  \ for trailing edge thickness \ninspections but did not specify a minimum measurement\
  \ for the trailing edge \nradius.  \n4. The higher engine power settings used by\
  \ the operator since August 2014 \nwere within the flight manual limits.  Therefore\
  \ it was unlikely that the \noperator's engine handling policy contributed to the\
  \ engine failure.  \n4.3. Maintenance practices  \nSafety issue:  When aircraft\
  \ maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for \nContinuing Airworthiness\
  \  for a task, perhaps because they are very familiar with  the basic \ntask and\
  \ do not know that  the task documentation has changed,  safety might be  \ncompromised\
  \ . \nEngine inspections  \n4.3.1.  In 2003 P&WC had amended an inspection procedure\
  \ to improve the early detection of \ncracks in the compressor turbine  blades.28\
  \  The original procedure had called for a \nborescope to be inserted into the fuel\
  \ nozzle port in the combustion module casing to look \nfor heat distress on the\
  \ upstream29 side of the compressor turbine  disk.  The amendment \nrecommended\
  \ that the  borescope be inserted through the exhaust duct also, to inspect the\
  \ \ndownstream  side of the disk and the trailing edge of the turbine blades.  The\
  \ lower, \noverlapping, part of the compressor turbine blades, where cracks had\
  \ been found in other \nengines , could be inspected only by viewing the  blades\
  \  from the exhaust port .  The amended \n                                     \
  \                   \n26 Email , P&WC, 9 March 2016.  \n27 An operating cycle is\
  \ one take -off and landing.  \n28 P&WC Service Information Letter PT6A -116. \n\
  29 Upstream is in reference to the direction of gas flow through the engine , which,\
  \ for the PT6 series of engin es, \nis from back to front . \n  \nFinal Report AO\
  \ -2015 -001 \n<< Page 17 >>\n procedure had been  first added to the engine maintenance\
  \ manual in 2006 .  The Service \nLetter had been  revised and reissued in July\
  \ 2013.  \n4.3.2.  Since 2004, P&WC had issued further Servi ce Information Letters\
  \ and Service Bulletins to \ndraw attention to the detrimental effects of engine\
  \ over -temperature events on the turbine \nsection, and how careful engine handling\
  \ and proper maintenance procedures could \nprevent this damage.  Appendix 1 has\
  \  a summary of the information provided by P&WC.  \n4.3.3.  The engine failure\
  \ occurred 87 flight hours after the previous scheduled maintenance , \nwhich included\
  \ a borescope inspection of the compressor turbine blades.  However, when \nengineers\
  \ of the maintenance provider were inspect ing other PT6 A-34 engines soon after\
  \ \nthe accident , the P&WC representative  observed that the engineers  did not\
  \  follow fully the \nborescope requirement  to inspect  the downstream ( forward\
  \ ) side of the compressor turbine \ndisk. \n4.3.4.  P&WC did not attempt to estimate\
  \ t he rate of propagation of the fatigue crack in the \ncompressor turbine  blade\
  \ .  Therefore it is not known whether the crack could  have been \npresent, and\
  \ potentially detectable, at the time of the scheduled borescope inspection.  The\
  \ \nP&WC representative suggested that a borescope operator ought to be able to\
  \ see a crack \nof five millimetres or more in length.  P&WC informed the Commission\
  \ that the published \n300-hour inspection interval remain ed satisfactory for detectin\
  \ g cracks in compressor \nturbine  blade s. \n4.3.5.  The Commission has discussed\
  \ previously  the issue of staff  relying on their memory or \nhabitual procedures\
  \ when performing maintenance, and not referring to  and following \ncurrent procedure\
  \ s in a manual.30  Manufacturers  publish many amendments to manuals \nand Instructions\
  \ for Continuing Airworthiness , of which some might not  reach 'frontline' \nstaff.\
  \  If staff do not check t hat they are using the current procedure s for tasks\
  \ related to \nairworthiness , the intent of the procedure s can be undermined and\
  \ safety compromised . \n4.3.6.  The maintenance provider has confirmed, since the\
  \ accident, that it conducts fully the \ninspection requirements of the engine maintenance\
  \ manual.   It has also chosen not to use \noverhauled compressor turbi ne blades\
  \  in the future . \nSkydiving mission profile  \n4.3.7.  Following the review of\
  \ the skydiving mission profile, P&WC gave attention to the continued \nairworthiness\
  \ of applicable engines.  It advised that its analysis had determined that  there\
  \ \nwas a need to improv e some maintenance requirements.  It said, in part : \n\
  Repetitive short missions with the majority of its length in the high end of the\
  \ \nallowed power ratings reinforces the need to introduce better creep resistant\
  \ \ncompressor turbine blades \u2026 for skydiving mis sions. For engines pre-SB1690\
  \ \nconfiguration used in skydive operation, a [hot section inspection] requirement\
  \ \nwill be added to improve compressor turbine blade reliability to reach [stated\
  \ \ntime between overhaul].31 \nThe MORE registration process  \n4.3.8.  Although\
  \ the  operator had purchased the right to use the MORE maintenance programme, \n\
  MORE did not know that the operator was doing so, because registration of the engines\
  \ had \nnot been  completed.  Therefore  MORE would not have advised the operator\
  \ of changes to \nthe programme.  If a maintenance provider were not aware of changes\
  \ to an engine \nmaintenance programme, the continuing airworthiness of that engine\
  \ could be affected.  \n                                                       \
  \ \n30 For example, see Report  11-004, Piper PA31 -350 Navajo Chieftain, ZK -MYS,\
  \ landing without nose landing \ngear extended, Nelson Aerodrome, 11 May 2011. \
  \ \n31 Email , Pacific Aerospace, 10 March 2016. SB1690 is Service Bulletin 1690;\
  \ see Appendix 1, paragraph 3.  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -001 4.3.9.\
  \  In this case there had been  no ch anges to the MORE programme for the engine\
  \ between the \noperator's assumed registration in 2009 and the day of the accident.\
  \  Fortunately, if there \nhad been changes, the maintenance provider would have\
  \ been aware of them, because it \nmaintained another 750XL  engine of the operator\
  \ under the same STC.32 \n4.3.10.  MORE had 12 engines (on nine aeroplanes) in New\
  \ Zealand registered for this STC.  As at \nJune 2015 the register was more than\
  \ 50% inaccurate as to aeroplane type and \nregistration.  One likely reason was\
  \ that oper ators did not always advise sales of \nparticipating engines to MORE,\
  \ as required by the STC.  \n4.3.11.  Compliance with the registration and applicable\
  \ requirements of an approved  STC is a \ncondition  for the continuing airworthiness\
  \  of an aircraft or product . \nFindings  \n5. The operator had maintained the\
  \ engine in accordance with an approved, \nalternative maintenance programme, but\
  \ the registration of the engine into \nthat programme had not been  completed.\
  \  The administrative oversight did \nnot affect the reliability of the eng ine\
  \ or contribute to the blade failure.  \n6. It was likely that the maintenance provider\
  \ had not followed fully the engine \nmanufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting\
  \ the compressor \nturbine blades.  It could not be determined whether the crack\
  \ might hav e \nbeen present, and potentially detectable, at the most recent borescope\
  \ \ninspection.  \n4.4. Survivability aspects  \nSafety issue:  Parachute drop pilot\
  \ s were not required to wear lifejacket s or flotation device s \nif their flights\
  \ were expected to remain within gliding distance of land.  That scenario  \ndownplayed\
  \  the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to  use the\
  \ \nemergency parachute when over or near water . \nTandem pairs  \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ last tandem pair to leave the aeropl ane estimated that the bale-out took up to\
  \ 20 \nseconds.  There was some delay after the call to \"Get out! \", caused by\
  \ tandem masters \nhaving to ensure that the y were attached to the ir riders correctly\
  \  and by one pair having to \nrelease their aeroplane restrai nt.33  The last tandem\
  \ pair had to wait for the pilot and his \ndeployed chute to clear the rear door.\
  \  \n4.4.2.  The tandem masters estimated that they had all left the aeroplane by\
  \ about 1,500 ft above \nthe lake, deploying their reserve parachutes by 1,000 ft.\
  \  Parachu ting rules required reserve \nparachute s to be deployed for tandem jump\
  \ s from less than 5,000 ft above ground, \nbecause the reserve parachutes inflate\
  \ d more rapidly than main parachutes.  \n4.4.3.  Each of the tandem riders was\
  \ equipped with a lifejacket34, but the operator did not require \nthe tandem masters\
  \ to wear lifejackets because  the operator expected that , under normal \ncircumstances,\
  \ the reserve parachutes w ould provide sufficient buoyancy.  Following the \naccident\
  \ the operator provided its tandem masters with flotation device s. \n         \
  \                                               \n32 The operator had fulfilled\
  \ the MORE\xAE regist ration requirements for the other 750XL in June 2010.  \n\
  33 Restraint belts were fitted even though Civil Aviation Rule 91.505(b) exempted\
  \ a person engaged in \nparachute operations from the requirement to have a seat,\
  \ berth, safety belt or restraining belt.  \n34 As required by  Civil Aviation Rule\
  \ 105.57.  \n  \nFinal Report AO -2015 -001 \n<< Page 19 >>\n The pilot  \n4.4.4.\
  \  Parachute drop pilots are required to wear emergency parachute s on every skydiving\
  \ \nflight.35  The operator had given the pilot ground -based training, but did\
  \ not require its pilots \nto complete actual parachute descent s.  The pilot had\
  \ not parachuted previously.  \n4.4.5.  The pilot could not recall having inspected\
  \ the emergency parachute before putting it on \nthat morning.  He later said that\
  \ he had never performed a pre -flight inspection of the \nparachute  himself .\
  \  The maintenance record  for the parachute w as found to be in order.36 \n4.4.6.\
  \  The operator did not equip its pilots with lifejacket s and was not required\
  \ to do so, because \nits flight s from Taup\u014D  that used the Taup\u014D  aerodrome\
  \ parachute landing area remain ed \nwithin gliding distance of land  at all times.37\
  \  This was a safety issue, because the scenario  \ndownplayed  the possibility\
  \ of a pilot hav ing to make a ditching, or bale out and drift to a \nwater landing.\
  \  In this case it was fortuitous that none of the parachutists or the pilot landed\
  \ \nin the lake.  A recommendation was made to the operator to investigate options\
  \ for \nprovid ing its drop pilots with flotation device s. \n4.4.7.  Pilots are\
  \ trained to put their aeroplane s into a gliding descent if they have to make a\
  \ forced \nlanding.  The pilot, with minimal experience of the 750XL and parachuting\
  \ operations, \ndetermined that he could not reach a suitable area on land.  Although\
  \ ditching in the lake \nwas an option, he was aware that the flig ht manual warned\
  \ that the aeroplane's ditching \ncharacteristics were unknown .  Therefore he chose\
  \ to abandon the aeroplane.  \n4.4.8.  The operator trained its pilots to bale out\
  \ of the cabin rear door after others had gone, and \nto pull the emergency parachute\
  \ ripcord  when clear of the aeroplane.  However, i t was  \nacknowledged that not\
  \ all emergency situations were foreseeable , and a pilot might have to \nbale out\
  \  in a manner contrary to their training.  \n4.4.9.  The pilot  did not intend\
  \ to bale out before the last of the parachuti sts.  However,  by doing so \nhe\
  \ left the aeroplane uncontrolled , and it began to roll and dive shortly afterwards\
  \ .  If \nanyone still on board  had had difficult y exiting the aeroplane , their\
  \ survivability could have \nbeen jeopardised by the aeroplane's rapidly changing\
  \  attitude.   In this case the proximity to \npeople and property also meant that\
  \ the unoccupied aeroplane was a threat.  \n4.4.10.  The operator suggested t hat\
  \ it was likely that the pilot did not s ee in the cockpit mirror that \nthere were\
  \ people in the cabin , bec ause the dark -coloured jumpsuits they were wearing\
  \ \nmerged with th e dark cabin rear bulkhead.  T he operator took action to improve\
  \ the colour \ncontrast between the cabin rear bulkhead and the  jumpsuits . \n\
  4.4.11.  By baling out through the cockpit door before everyone else had left the\
  \ aeroplane, the pilot  \nrisked a collision or entanglement with the last tandem\
  \ pair who exited from the rear door.  \nHe also risked colliding with the tail\
  \ plane  because he  did not wait until he was clear of the \naeroplane to deploy\
  \ his parachute .  Either  mishap could have led to serious or fatal injuries. \
  \  \nIf he had exited through the cabin rear door  he would have been sure t hat\
  \ he was the last to \nleave and would not have put others at risk.  \nTraining\
  \ of p arachute  drop pilots  for emergenc ies \n4.4.12.  The chief pilot and chief\
  \ parachute instructor were jointly responsible for training drop pilots \nin the\
  \ use of emergency parachute s and in emergency procedures .  The pilot's  training\
  \ \nrecord , signed by the instructor and counter -signed by the pilot,  indicated\
  \ that this \ncomprehensive training had been  done.   However, his  hasty exit\
  \ through the cockpit door \n                                                  \
  \      \n35 Passengers on a skydiving flight who are not engaged in a parachute\
  \ operation  are also required to wear \nemergency parachutes . \n36 Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules required maintenance records for parachutes, as they are a type of aircraft.\
  \  \n37 As permitted by Civil Aviation Rule 91.525 . \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2015 -001 before everyone else had baled out , and his immediate deployment\
  \ of the parachute , were  \ncontrary to what he had been instructed . \n4.4.13.\
  \  The pilot's reaction was understandable given  that the e ngine failure  happened\
  \ on his first \nday of solo flying in the role  and at a relatively low height\
  \ .  However, his training had been \ncompleted so recently that the correct procedures\
  \ , if they had been thoroughly un derstood,  \nshould have been fresh in his mind\
  \ . \n4.4.14.  Civil Aviation Rule 91.705 made drop pilots responsible for ensuring\
  \ that each person \ncarried in their aircraft, other than a person intending to\
  \ make a parachute descent, wa s \ntrained in the use of their emerge ncy parachute\
  \ and was briefed on the method to be used \nfor exiting the aircraft (see Appendix\
  \ 2).   Rule 91.707 implied that a pilot was responsible \nfor ensuring that their\
  \  emergency parachute (and any other emergency parachutes carried) \nwere serviceable\
  \ , at the least by inspecting the parachute packing card.  \n4.4.15.  In order\
  \ to be able to comply with these Rule requirements, p arachute drop pilots must\
  \ have \na thorough understanding of the emergency procedures  applicable to their\
  \ aircraft .  Training \nin emergency pr ocedures typically requires rote learning\
  \ so that one's response to an \nemergency is instinctive and correct.   The pilot's\
  \ response to the engine failure , along  with \nhis later comment that he had n\
  \ ever personally inspected the emergency parachute , \nindicated  that he had not\
  \ fully understood  the procedures.  Therefore it was likely  that his \nemergency\
  \ training had not been  adequate . \n4.4.16.  The operator advised that, since\
  \ the accident, it had  added a voluntary tandem jump to the \nparachute drop pilot\
  \ training, and include a group training session with tandem masters as \npart of\
  \ the annual competency testing for pilots.    \nFindings  \n7. The operator had\
  \ not equipped its pilots with flotation device s to cover  the \npossibility of\
  \ a ditching or an emergency bale -out over or nea r water.  \n8. The pilot had\
  \ demonstrated that he was competent and he had the required \nratings.  However,\
  \ it was likely that the operator's training of the pilot in \nemergency procedures\
  \ was inadequate .  This contributed to the pilot  making \na hasty exit from the\
  \  aeroplane that jeopardised others.  \n  \n  \nFinal Report AO -2015 -001 \n<<\
