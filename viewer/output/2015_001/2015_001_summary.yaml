  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue or overwork contributing to the incident in the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot's actions during the emergency evacuation were influenced by "natural anxiety and also, in part, to inadequate training in emergency procedures by the operator" (4.1.3). This indicates a human error in the decision-making process during a critical situation. Additionally, the maintenance provider's failure to fully follow the borescope inspection requirements (4.3.3) could be considered a human error or assumption about the procedure.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The pilot's inadequate training in emergency procedures contributed to the evacuation being jeopardized (4.1.3). Furthermore, the pilot's training was likely inadequate, as evidenced by his hasty exit from the airplane, which jeopardized others (4.4.15, 5.8). The maintenance provider's potential lack of adherence to the inspection procedure also suggests a training issue (4.3.6).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot had not previously parachuted and did not recall inspecting the emergency parachute before use (4.4.4, 4.4.5). This lack of familiarity with the emergency equipment could have affected his performance during the evacuation.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no specific mention of issues related to teamwork, communication, or leadership skills among the crew that contributed to the accident in the provided document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The maintenance provider likely did not follow the engine manufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor turbine blades (4.3.6). Additionally, the pilot did not adhere to the trained emergency procedures during the evacuation (4.4.15).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's decision not to require pilots to wear flotation devices (4.4.6) and the inadequate training provided to the pilot (4.4.15) suggest issues with the organization's safety culture and its approach to safety management.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The failure to verify critical dimensions of overhauled compressor turbine blades (4.2.5) and the lack of full compliance with inspection procedures (4.3.6) indicate shortcomings in risk management and analysis.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While there is no direct mention of regulatory non-compliance contributing to the accident, the document does discuss the importance of following Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness (4.1.5) and the implications of not being fully registered in a maintenance program (4.3.8).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's decision to bail out through the cockpit window rather than the cabin rear door (4.1.3) and his lack of awareness of the last tandem pair in the cabin (4.4.10) indicate a loss of situational awareness during the emergency.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's inadequate training and the subsequent actions during the emergency (4.4.15) suggest a lack of preparedness for such situations.
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The failure of the compressor turbine blade due to inadequate specifications for overhauled blades (4.2.5) and the potential oversight during the borescope inspection (4.3.6) highlight issues with the maintenance and inspection regimes.
