occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and  
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the occurrences with a view to avoiding similar  occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 7 January 2015 a Pacific Aerospace Limited 750XL aeroplane was being used for 
tandem parachuting (or ‘skydiving’) operations at Taupō a erodrome.  During the climb on 
the fourth flight of the day , the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A -34 engine failed suddenly .  
The 12 parachutists  and the pilot baled out of  the a eroplane  and landed without  serious  
injury.  The aeroplane crashed into Lake Taupō and was destroyed . 
1.2. The engine failure originated from a fatigue c rack in a compressor turbine blade.  The failed 
blade was one of a set of overhauled blades that had been installed 1 ,127 flight hours 
before  the accident flight.  The inspection interval for  overhauled blades was 3 ,000 hours.  
1.3. The turbine section of the en gine had been inspected during scheduled maintenance 87 
flight hours before the accident.  The recommended procedure was to inspect both sides of 
the compressor turbine blades for any cracks, but it was very likely that only one side was 
inspected.  It was not determined whether the fatigue crack existed and might have been 
visible at the time of that inspection.  
1.4. It was fortuitous that none of the parachutists or the pilot landed in the lake.  Although each 
tandem rider  was wearing a lifejacket , the tandem masters would have had to rely on the 
buoyancy of their un -deployed main parachutes to stay afloat.  The pilot had no flotation 
device.       
1.5. The following safety issues  were identified during the inquiry:  
 the measurement  specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had 
been through  a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same  as those for 
new blades .  Blades that had been through that repair process , without verification of 
critical dimensio ns, might  fail before the next 3 ,000-hour i nspection  
 when aircraft maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for  Continuing 
Airworthiness for a task, perhaps because they are very familiar with  the basic task and 
do not know that  the task documentation has changed, safety might be  compromised  
 parachute drop pilot s were not required to wear lifejacket s or flotation device s if their 
flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land.  That scenario  
downplayed  the possibility of a  pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to use the 
emergency parachute when over or near water . 
1.6. The failed blade and two others sampled from the set were undersize in some dimensions, 
compared with new blade s.  The size discrepancy  likely contributed  to the fatigue failure.   As 
a result of this occurrence, Pratt & Whitney Canada amended the  measurement 
specifications for the acceptance of blades that had been through a  strip and recoat  repair 
process  to better reflect  the criteria  for new blades  in the trailing edge area . 
1.7. Pratt & Whitney Canada and Pacific Aerospace also reviewed  the contemporary operation of 
the 750XL aeroplane and PT6 A-34 engine in the skydiving  role against  their original design 
assumptions .  They found that, o n average, op erators were using higher engine power 
settings more frequently and for longer periods tha n had been  assumed.   As a result  of 
these findings , Pratt & Whitney Canada will introduce an additional scheduled inspection for 
PT6A -34 engines that are used in single -engine installations . 
1.8. The aeroplane operator (Skydive Taupo  Limited ) had maintained the engine in accord ance 
with a maintenance programme that was a  recognised alternative to that of Pratt & Whitney 
Canada .  The operator had not complete d the regist ration process wi th the programme 
supplier , but neither this oversight nor th e alternative  maintenance programme was a factor 
in the engine failure.  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 1.9. The pilot did not follow the operator’s recommended procedure for baling out, which put 
himself and others at risk  of serious injury.   To reduce the likelihood of this hazard, t he 
operator improve d the emergency procedures training given to its pilots . 
1.10.  The Transport Accident Investigation Commission made a recommendation  to Skydive 
Taupo  to investigate options for equip ping its parachute drop pilots with effective flotation 
device s. 
1.11.  The key lessons  arising from this inquiry were as follows:  
 operators and pilots engaged in skydiving operations should assess carefully the risk of 
having to use an emergency parachute  or land ing in water , and ensure that they have 
the appropriate training and equipment .  Pilots must have a thorough understanding of 
the care and use of emergency parachutes, as their lives depend on them  
 aircraft m aintenance engineers should not commence any task related to airworthiness 
without ensuring that they have the current procedure and information necessary for the 
task 
 operators and maintenance providers should ensure that they comply fully with any 
regist ration or other requirement of approved supplemental type certificates .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) advised the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) of the accident  at approximately 1330 on 7 January 2015 .  The Commission  
opened an inquiry under section 13 (1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
Act 1990 .  Three investigators travelled to Taupō that afternoon  to commence the 
investigation . 
2.2. The pilot was interviewed on the day of the accident and on two later occasions.  Other 
persons interviewed included the tandem masters and their passengers, Skydive Taupo  
Limited ’s (the operator’s ) chief executive and chief pilot, maintenance engineers an d some 
eyewitnesses.  
2.3. Police divers completed an underwater video survey of the wreckage and recovered some 
small items on 8 January  2015 .  All of the wreckage was removed on 9 January 2015  and 
stored initially  at Taupō  aerodrome , before being taken to the Commission’s wreckage 
examination and storage facility near Wellington . 
2.4. On 8 January 2015 an investigator from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada was 
appointed as the accredited representative of Canada, being the state of the engine 
manufacturer.2  The accredited representative appointed Pratt & Whitney Canada ( P&WC ) to 
be an adviser.  
2.5. On 14 January 2015 the engine was shipped to the  P&WC  facility in Quebec, Canada.  The 
engine was examined by P&WC under the supervision of Canada’s accredited 
represe ntative , on behalf of the Commission,  over the period 10 -11 March 2015.  After 
evidence was found of fatigue failure of a compressor turbine  blade , the compressor turbine 
assembly was sent to the P&WC  materials laboratory , where more extensive examinations 
were conducted in May 2015.  On 25 June 2015 the Commission received a report from 
P&WC on the engine and the laboratory examinations .  The Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada  reviewed the P&WC laboratory report  for the Commission . 
2.6. On 27 July 2015  an investigator of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was appointed as 
the accredited representative of Australia.  That investigator made enquiries , on behalf of 
the Commission, at the Australian facility where the compres sor turbine assembly  had been 
inspected  and the blades replaced  in October 2013.  
2.7. On 20 August 2015 an investigator of the National Transportation Safety Board was 
appointed as the accredited representative of the United States in order to make enquiries  
in that country, on behalf of the Commission,  at the facility where the replacement blades 
had been overhauled.  
2.8. On 23 February 2017  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to interested 
persons for their comment.  
2.9. Written s ubmissions were received from Skydive Taupo, Pacific Aerospace Limited , Pratt & 
Whitney Canada , MORE Company Inc and  the C ivil Aviation Authority .  The Commission 
considered the submissions , and changes as a result of those submissions have been 
included i n the final report . 
2.10.  On 28 June 2017 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 Final Report AO -2015 -001 3. Factual information  
3.1. The accident flight  
3.1.1.  On Wednesday 7 January 2015 a Pacific Aerospace Limited 750XL aeroplane , registered 
ZK-SDT (the aeroplane) , was being used for commercial skydiving  at Taupō aerodrome .  The 
skydiving operator held an air operator’s certificate issued by the CAA under Civil Aviation 
Rules Part 115 , Adventure Aviation . 
3.1.2.  The day was fine with light winds.  The air temperature was 22OC and the sea level pressure 
1,018 hecto pascals .  At approximately 121 5 the aeroplane departed  with six tandem pairs 
and a pilot (the pilot) on board.3  This was the fourth flight  that day, all of them  flown by the 
same pilot.  The operator’s records showed that the weight and balance for all of the  flight s 
were within the flight manual limits.  
3.1.3.  After take -off from runway 1 7, the aeroplane climbed straight ahead along the shore of Lake 
Taupō .  When the aeroplane was approximately 2,100 feet ( ft) above the lake4, a loud bang 
came  from the engine and sparks emitted  from the e ngine e xhaust.  The propeller stopped  
quickly .  The pilot shut down the engine , put the aeroplane in to a glide  and broadcast a 
‘Mayday’ radio call .5 
3.1.4.  The tandem master who was seated nearest  to the pilot  quickly assessed that baling out 
would be safer for the parachutists than a forced landing , and s houted “Get out! ”  Each  
tandem master then had to ensure that they were  attached  correctly  to the ir rider  before 
they shuffl ed to the cabin rear door and ba led out.6 
3.1.5.  The pilot looked in the cockpit rear-view mirror that showed the cabin  interior .  Sure that all 
the tandem pairs h ad baled out , he then exited  through the cockpit door  adjacent to his 
seat.  However, two parachutist s were still on board.  
3.1.6.  The last tandem pair was about to exit when the tandem master saw parachute lines 
obstructing the exit.  He hesitated , and saw t he pilot  hit the top of the wing , forward of the 
cabin door,  then fall away .  The parachutist s then left the aeroplane . 
3.1.7.  All of the  occupants landed on dry land by the lake shore , with t wo receiv ing minor injuries . 
3.1.8.  The aeroplane struck the water at high speed , approximately 150 metres offshore and six 
kilometres from the aerodrome.  It broke into four main sections: the engine and propeller, 
the fuselage with the left wing attached, the right wing, and the tail.  
3.1.9.  Other pilots heard the Mayday call and many witnesses saw the accident.  As a result, 
emergency services were notified promp tly. 
  
                                                        
3 A tandem pair in a parachute jump comprises the tandem ‘master’, who wears the parachute and has 
complete control of the jump, and a ‘rider’ whose harness is connected to that of the tandem master  by four 
clips during the actual jump.  
4 The Taup ō aerodrome is 1 ,335 ft above mean sea level , approximately 160 ft above the lake elevation  of 
1,172 ft .  Imperial units are still used fo r vertical distances in civil aviation.  
5 ‘Mayday’ is the internationally recognised message to indicate ‘distress’, which is defined as a condition of 
being threatened by serious and/or imminent danger and which requires immediate assistance.  
6 To bale ou t is to use a parachute to abandon an aircraft in  flight.

 3.2. Personnel information  
The pilot  
3.2.1.  The pilot held a current commercial pilot licence ( aeroplane) , issued in 2011, and a valid 
Class 1 medical certificate with no conditions, restrictions or endorsements.   He had  nearly 
600 hours  of flying time , includ ing 14 hours on the 750X L. 
3.2.2.  The pilot  had had some  initial training on the 750XL in November 2014, during which time 
he had been issued with a parachute drop pilot rating.7  The drop rating was not specific to 
an aircraft type.  
3.2.3.  The chief pilot of the operat or had hired the pilot on 5 January 2015 .  Over the next two 
days , the pilot had flown six hours of skydiving flights  as pilot -in-command under the 
supervision  of the chief pilot .  On 6 January 2015 the pilot had been issued with a  750XL 
type rating  and completed an initial crew competency check  with the operator . 
3.2.4.  The engine failure occurred on the fourth flight of the pilot’s first day of flying without direct 
supervision.  
Tandem masters  
3.2.5.  The operator  employed  tandem masters with a minimum of 750 parachute descents.  The 
six tandem masters on the accident flight had individual experience of between 3 ,800 
descents  and 10,000 descents . 
3.3. Aircraft information   
3.3.1.  The Pacific Aerospace 750XL aeroplane is manufactured in New Zealand .  It was certificated 
by the CAA in 2003 , initially for the skydiving role, carry ing up to 17 individual parachutist s.8  
More than 100 of the type have been manufactured  in skydiving,  utility,  agricultural and 
passenger versions . 
3.3.2.  The aeroplane met the United States Federal Aviation Regulations Part 23, Airworthiness 
Standards for “normal, utility, acrobatic and commuter category airplanes ”.  There were no 
requirements in th ose standards that concerned ditching.9  The aeroplane flight manual 
warned that “the ditching characteristics of the aeroplane [ were] unknown”  (Pacific 
Aerospace Limited, pp. 3 -15).  The only known ditching of a 750XL had  had a fatal 
outcome.10 
3.3.3.  The standard engine is the P&WC PT6A -34 turboprop  (see Figure 1) .  The airflow through the 
engine is from back to front.  The air passes through a four -stage co mpress or section, is 
combined with fuel and burnt in the combustion chamber .  The combustion gases pass  
through two turbines.  The first is the c ompr essor turbine, which drives the compressor 
section and the accessories gearbox at the rear of the engine.  The second turbine is the 
power turbine , which  drives the propeller through a reduction gearbox.    
                                                        
7 Civil Aviation Rule 91.705(a) required the pilot in command of an aircraft performing a parachute drop 
operation to hold a parachute drop pilot rating issued under Civil Aviation Rules Part 61.   
8 Refer to 750XL flight manual Supplement 5, Installation of Parachuting Kit.  
9 To ditch is to make an emergency landing of an aircraft onto water.

3.3.4.  The accident aeroplane  had been manufactured in June 2005 in the agricultural version .  
The operator had acquired it i n 2009 and had it converted for skydiving.  The operator had 
replaced the originally installed engine with another PT6A -34 that had an operational and 
maintenance history known to  the operator.   This e ngine  had been manufactured in August 
2002 . 
3.3.5.  The previous scheduled maintenance was a 150 -hour/400 -hour maintenance check carried 
out between 30 November 2014 and 9 December 2014 . 
Alternative engine maintenance programme  
3.3.6.  The engine had been maintained , initially , in accordance with the P&WC Maintenance 
Programme, which specified 4 ,000 hours bet ween engine overhauls.  In November 2009 
the operator had purchased the right to use a supplemental type certificate (STC)11 of 
MORE® Company  Inc (MORE) of the United States  as the engine maintenance 
programme .12   
3.3.7.  MORE  described  the benefits of its programme as follows  (MORE Company Inc., 2004, p. 9) : 
  The MORE ® Instructions for Continued Airworthiness  use the P&WC maintenance 
manual as a foundation and then add several additional inspection methods: 
periodic boresco pe13 inspection of the hot [turbine] section, periodic inspection of 
the compressor and exhaust duct areas, periodic Power Plant -Adjustment/Test (to 
monitor engine performance), periodic spectrometric oil analysis, periodic oil filter 
debris analysis, perio dic vibrational analysis, etc.  
  The purpose of this aggressive inspection system is to find problems in their early 
stages … Early correction of engine problems will lead to an increase in engine 
durability, an increase in engine longevity, and an increase in engine safety; which in 
                                                        
11 A supplemental type certif icate is a certificate that allows changes to: a type certificate category or type 
acceptance certificate category; the type design; the flight manual; the operating limitations; and any special 
conditions prescribed on the type certificate or type accepta nce certificate.  
12 The Federal Aviation Administration had first approved STC number  SE00002EN in 1994.  The STC had been  
re-issued on 6 March 2009 . 
13 A borescope is a flexible magnifying tool that can be inserted through openings in an engine to inspect 
internal parts .

 turn will allow an increase in the engine overhaul interval and long term cost savings 
to the operator.  
3.3.8.  The MORE programme superseded or added to some P&WC requirements for turbine (or 
‘hot section ’14) inspection and overhaul intervals15, but did not extend the turbine and 
compressor service lives , which remained at 8,000 hours .16  The MORE  Instructions for 
Continued Airworthiness  included the following inspections, among others:  
 oil filter debris analysis and oil sample analysis every 150 hours  
 borescope inspecti on of the hot section and propeller balancing every 450 hours . 
3.3.9.  An operator that wished to maintain an engine under the MORE  programme would purchase 
the right, following which MORE would provide  a customised maintenance programme 
manual .  The manual explai ned the registration process that the operator should complete 
within 30 days .  Part of the process was a detailed ‘initial entry inspection’ of the engine.   A 
registration was not completed and the STC could not be used until MORE sent the operator 
a cert ificate.  
3.3.10.  The United States considered a change to a maintenance programme to be a major 
modification.  The MORE initial entry inspection checklist included a requirement to submit 
a Form  337, with details of the modification , to the aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation 
Administration.  The CAA had a similar requirement and used the same form number for 
advising major modifications.  
3.3.11.  When the operator purchased the STC in 2009 , it did not complete the r egistration process 
within the required 30 days.  The initial entry inspection  of the engine  had been  completed  
on 30 November 2011 , but the inspection checklist noted against the Form 337 
requirement, “Not yet done. Await owner to get aircraft on maintenance programme with 
CAA”.  The CAA had no record of having received the Form 337 .  MORE had not been sent 
the required documents and n o certificate had been  issued for the engine .  No-one at the 
operator or MORE recognised th is until after the engine failure .  
3.3.12.  Although the MORE registration had not been  completed, the operator compl ied with all of 
the programme’s inspection tasks and schedules as if it had been.  There had been  no 
revisions to the programme between the assumed registration in 2009 and January 2015.  
The required inspections and oil analyses had not shown any abnormal engine wear or 
trend.   
3.3.13.  Between the initial entry inspection on 30 November 2011 for the MORE ® programme and 
7 January 2015 the aeroplane  had flown 2,250 hours.  
Compressor turbine overhaul  
3.3.14.  P&WC Service Bulletin 1403  required inspection s of compressor turbine disks and blade 
sets at the following intervals : 
(a) Compressor turbine disk with full set of new blades installed at last shop 
visit,  inspect within 5,000 hours.  
(b) Compressor turbine disk with full or partial set of previously run compressor  
turbine blades installed, inspect within 3,000 hours since last compressor 
turbine blade  inspection.  
3.3.15.  The turbine inspection process required  the replacement of the blades with a set of new or 
overhauled  blades.  The overhaul  process included  cleaning and inspecti ng the blades using 
                                                        
14 A hot section is the turbine section (or ‘module’) of a gas turbine (‘jet’) engine . 
15 Namely P&WC Service Bull etins 1303, 1403, 1703 and 1803.  
16 As specified in P&WC Service Bulletins 1002 and 1302.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 non-destructive methods, checking for blade stretch ( usually referred to as creep)17 and the 
sacrificial (destructive) testing of two blades from the set .  The set would be scr apped if the 
sacrificial blades failed the test.  Otherwise, b lades that met the inspection  criteria  could be 
re-used without further work.18  If repair were required , the protective thermal coating would 
be stripped , the repair carried out, and a new coating applied . 
3.3.16.  In compliance with  the above service bulletin , the compressor turbine module  was removed 
for inspection  in May 2013 at 4 ,974.25 engine hours  since new .  The module and 
associated components were  sent to an  approved engine overhaul facility in Australia , along 
with a  replacement  set of 56 overhauled compressor turbine blades  to be installed  after  the 
inspection .19 
3.3.17.  The replacement blad es (part number 3120751 -01) had been  obtained from an approved 
New Zealand supplier .  That company had obtained them from a company in the United 
States  that was the only facility approved by P&WC to overhaul compressor turbine blades .  
The blades had the appropriate Authorised Release Certificate  from the United States  
(Federal Aviation Administration  Form 8130 -3). 
3.3.18.  The Australian facility installed the 56 overhauled blades and two new blades into the 
turbine disk, and issued  the appropriate Authorised Release Certificate s for the work done .  
3.3.19.  The operator’s maintenance provider  had reassembled the  turbine module and reinstalled 
the engine into the a eroplane.  The aeroplane  had returned to service on 22 May 2013.  
3.3.20.  The overhauled turbine blades had operated  for 1 ,127.9 hours  before the engine failed  on 7 
January 2015 . 
Operator’s engine handling policy  
3.3.21.  Prior to August 2014 the operator had not used the maximum  engine (torque and inter -
turbine temperature ) settings for take -off and climb that were permitted by the flight manual 
(see Table 1).  The operator had initially chose n to us e lower power settings for its 750XL 
aeroplanes in order to reduce turbine thermal distress , which meant that turbine module 
components would be more likely to achieve the published times between mandatory 
overhaul s. 
3.3.22.  In spite of this conservative strategy,  the operator had had to replace the hot section of 
another engine  before the published overhaul time  because of turbine blade creep .  As a 
result, and after conferring with other skydiving operators who used the 750XL, the operator 
had raised the engine t orque setting for take -off (see Table 1) , but not  the turbine 
temperature setting .  The operator had considered that this change would improve the 
commercial operation of the aeroplane, in part because a higher take -off power would give a 
quicker take -off and allow an earlier  torque  reduction for the climb, the flight phase that  
comprised the majority of each flight.  
3.3.23.  The pilot estimated that the engine power settings immediately before the engine failure 
had been a torque of 62 pounds per square inch and a turbine temperature of around 
730OC.  The propeller revolutions per minute  limit of 2 ,006 was observed at all times.  
                                                        
17 Creep is a detrimental effect on material properties, which is dependent on the material and the following 
parameters: time, temperature and stress.  An increase in temperature or stress can result in a decreased time 
before creep occurs . 
18 P&WC advised that there w as no life limit for compressor turbine blades . 
19 The compressor turbine assembly had 58 blades.   Two blades from every set sent for inspection and overhaul 
were sacrificed for metallurgical analysis as part of the overhaul process.  Therefore, two new blades were added 
to the set when it was returned.

Recorded data  
3.3.24.  No flight data recorder w as fitted to the aeroplane, nor w as one  required to be  fitted . 
3.3.25.  A GPS tracking  unit was installed in the aeroplane to record the aeroplane’s position, 
course , speed and altitude.  E very 25 seconds  the current data was sent as a mobile phone 
text message  to the operator’s base .  The retrieved data matched the pilot’s rec ollection  of 
the flight  path on the accident flight . 
3.3.26.  An optional  data acquisition alarm monitor , which r ecord ed some engine parameters such 
as torque and turbine temperature, was installed in the aeroplane.  A display on the cockpit 
instrument panel  provided visual and  aural alert s in the event of a parameter exceedance.  
The pilot said there was no alarm during the accident flight.   
3.3.27.  The memory module of the data acquisition alarm monitor was mounted  on the forward face 
of the engine firewall.  The module was found, but the crash had dislodged the memory 
chip, which was not found.  
3.3.28.  The operator had downloaded the recorded engine data periodically to monitor the engine 
condition and performance trend s.  A separate investigation by the CAA after the accident  
found that  the operator  had not been using  the system effectively  to enable reliable  trend 
monitoring.20  As a result, t he maintenance provider amended its procedures and training.  
3.3.29.  The flight manual noted that the electronic Ng21 display also stored the peak value of Ng 
since electrical power was last applied .  The engine instruments that were of the same 
design were sent to the ir manufacturer in the United States22 to recover the stored data .  No 
useful data was obtained .  The instrument manufacturer later advised that the instruments 
took a ‘snapshot’ of data at pre -set time intervals , and a parameter was only recorded as 
the peak value  if its value at that time was greater than t he previous peak  for three seconds  
or longer .  A peak value  was not nece ssarily an exceedance  of a flight manual limit .  The 
instruments did not record parameter values at the time they lost electrical power.   Pacific 
Aerospace was advised of this corrected information.

 Final Report AO -2015 -001 3.4. Medical and pathological information  
3.4.1.  The operator had a drug and alcohol policy a s required by Civil Aviation Rules Part 115 , 
Adventure Aviation .  That policy required th e responsible manager to consider the need to 
test crew members after any incident.  In this case the manager decided that the tandem 
masters could not have contributed to an  engine failure , so they were not t ested . 
3.4.2.  The manager tested the pilot for alcohol immediately after he arrived back at the 
aerodrome.  The test was negative.  A person certified for drug screening and collection 
tested t he pilot later that day.  That test was negative . 
3.5. Tests and research  
3.5.1.  Between 10 March and 11 March 2015 t he engine was examined at the P&WC plant in 
Canada under the supervision of the accredited representative of Canada.   There was no 
sign of foreign object damage to the engine, or of pre -impact thermal stress in the turbine 
(‘hot’) section.  The damage was consistent with the  engine  having been no t rotat ing at 
impact.  
3.5.2.  All of the blades of both turbines were fractured.  A visual examination identified one 
compressor turbine blade  that was suspect  (the arrowed blade  in Figure 2), because it had  a 
relatively flat fracture  surface .  The m ark ‘R1’ (reworked once) on the platform of the  blade 
showed  that it had been stripped and recoated  previously  (see Figure 3).  Therefore it was 
very likely that th e blade (and the others in the replacement set)  had been in service for at 
least 6,100 hours .23  Turbine blades are not identified individually  and can be re -used as 
long as they meet the inspection/repair acceptance  criteria .  The total time in service for the 
blades was not determined.  
3.5.3.  A microscopic examination found  that the fracture surfaces of all of the compressor turbine 
blades, except the suspect blade , were characteristic of overload.  The fracture surface of  
the suspect  blade  had two distinct zones : one characteristic of fatigue towards the trailing 
edge ; and one characteristic of overload  (see Figure 4).  There was no metallurgical anomaly 
in the trailing edge zone that could have initiated the fracture.  
3.5.4.  The trailing edge radius of th e suspect  blade was less than th e dimension  specified for a 
new blade .  Measurement s of other blades  from the set found that “potentially other blades 
from the overhauled blades had  under minimum  [trailing edge ] thickness and/or [trailing 
edge ] radius ” (P&WC, 2015) . 
3.5.5.  The e xamination determined that the engine failure was initiated by the fracture of a 
compressor turbine blade.  The P&WC investigation report said, in part  (P&WC, 2015, p. 30) : 
One compressor turbine blade fractured by fatigue initiating at the trailing edge 
tip of the [blade], propagating towards the leading edge until final fracture by 
tensile overload.  
The under minimum t railing edge radius may have contributed to the fatigue 
crack initiation.  
3.5.6.  The compressor turbine blade s were  overhauled at an approved  United States facility that 
was an associated company of P&WC .  The strip  and recoat process used by the supplier 
was approved by P&WC  and complied with its aftermarket specification . 
                                                        
23 This figure is the nominal 5,000 -hours’ inspection interval for new blades plus the 1,128 hours since this 
blade set had been installed during the May 2013 compressor turbine module overhaul.

3.6. Mission profile review   
3.6.1.  Aircraft and engine manufacturers collaborate in defining the intended use, or ‘mission 
profile’, of each aircraft -engine combination.  The mission profile affects the physical design, 
the engine power requirements, and the frequency and content of schedul ed maintenance.  
3.6.2.  P&WC explained that component life and durability are predicated on operators adhering to 
the design mission profile, which takes into account factors such as flight duration and 
power demands.   Significant long -term operation above standar d mission parameters 
undermines the designers’ assumptions and can lead to reduced lives for components and 
the aircraft.   In practice, operators are unlikely to know the parameters of the design 
mission profile . 
3.6.3.  In 2015 P&WC, in conjunction with Pacific A erospace, reviewed the engine handling 
procedures  of nine skydiving operators in seven countries, including New Zealand, that used 
the 750XL with the PT6A -34 engine.  The review produced an average mission profile that 
P&WC compared with the mission profil e that was originally specified.24 
3.6.4.  The review found that skydiving operators typically operate d their engines at the  flight 
manual inter -turbine temperature limits for take-off and climb.  Exceedances can occur 
during  the climb , especially on hot days, when pilots operate to the torque limit s and do not 
respect the inter -turbine temperature  limits.  At a given torque setting t he inter -turbine 
temperature  increases with altitude  and could exceed the temperature limit.  The review 
also found that engine s were  being  operat ed at the high end of the operating limits for 72% 
of the average mission duration . 
3.6.5.  As a result of the review, P&WC advised that it would revise the maintenance procedures for 
single -engine applications of the PT6A -34 engine in the skydiving role.25  
 
                                                        
24 Pacific Aerospace advised that this was four jumps per hour from 10,000 ft.  
25 P&WC planned to incorporate the revision into the PT6A engine maintenance  manual in April 2017 .

 3.7. Other information  
Type certificate anomalies  
3.7.1.  In its  separate investigation of th is accident  (see paragraph 3.3.2 6), the CAA identified an 
anomaly with the aircraft type certificate that it issued for the 750XL.  The anomaly arose 
because of dual c ertification of the PT6A -34 engine by Canada and the United States.  The 
750XL is manufactured with a PT6A -34 engine.  Although t he CAA had accepted only the 
Canadian certification for all PT6A -series engines, it certificated the 750XL with reference to 
the United States engine certification.  The CAA took internal action to correct this anomaly .   
3.7.2.  A further anomaly concerned t he CAA’s acceptance of the MORE® maintenance programme 
STC for the 750XL.  The STC  is held by a United States company and approved f or the PT6A -
34 engine certificated by the United States .  Canada had not approved the STC for use with 
PT6A -34 engines certificated by Canada.   Further investigation led to the identification of 
other potential anomalies with approved engine STCs.  The CAA  took action to correct these.

 Final Report AO -2015 -001 4. Analysis  
4.1. What happened  
4.1.1.  A fractured compressor turbine blade caused the engine failure .  The fracture originated in a 
fatigue crack in the trailing edge of the blade.  The blade , one of a set of overhauled blades , 
had been operated for less than half the time before the next inspection was due in 
accordance with Service Bulletin 1403 (see paragraph 3.3.14) . 
4.1.2.  The engine failure occurred at a low height and over terrain that did not offer favourable 
option s for a forced la nding.  As all of the occupants were wearing  parachutes, bal ing out 
was the most appropriate action to take .  The  experience of  the tandem masters con tributed 
to a successful  evacuation . 
4.1.3.  The pilot  unwittingly jeopardised the evacuation by baling out  through  his cockpit  window 
rather than  from the cabin rear door, and by deploying his parachute immediately.  His 
actions were very likely d ue to  natural anxiety and also, in part , to inadequate training in 
emergency procedures by the operator.  
Safety issu es 
4.1.4.  Turbine engines, in general, are extremely reliable, which has led to their acceptance and 
approval for an increasing number of commercial single -engine -aircraft operations.  
However, a turbine blade failure will usually cause other  blade failures on th at turbine dis k.  
Blade fragments will destroy downstream turbine stages, leading to total engine failure.  
Therefore turbine reliability is  important for  aviation safety.  
4.1.5.  The following safety issues were identified during this in quiry : 
 the measurement  specifications for overhauled  compressor turbine blades that had 
been through a strip and recoat  repair process were not exactly the same  as those 
for new blades .  Blades that had been through that repair process , without 
verification of critical dimension s, might  fail before the next 3 ,000-hour  inspection  
 when aircraft maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for 
Continuing Airworthiness  for a task, perhaps  because  they are very familiar with  the 
basic task and do not know that  the task documentation has changed, safety might  
be compromised  
 parachute drop pilot s were not required to wear lifejacket s or flotation device s if 
their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land.  That scenario  
downplayed  the possibility of a  pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to  use 
the e mergency parachute  when over or near water . 
4.2. Premature failure of t he compressor turbine blade  
Safety issue :  The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blad es 
that had been through a strip and recoat  repair process were not exactly the same  as those 
for new blades .  Blades that had been through that repair process , without verification of 
critical dimensions, might  fail before the next 3 ,000-hour inspection . 
4.2.1.  The examination of the engine by P&WC identified the compressor turbine blade that had 
fractured first and caused  the engine failure.  The blade fracture surface had distinct fatigue 
and overload zones.  Due to the damage, only approximate m easurement s of the blade 
dimensions in the fatigue zone could be performed.  These showed  that the radius  of the  
trailing edge , after allowing for the thermal coating applied to  blades,  was less than that 
specifi ed for a new blade . 
4.2.2.  Measurements were also taken of t he remnants of six other  overhauled blades and one of 
the two blades that had been new when installed  in May 2013 .  One of the overhauled 
blades  was under -size in trailing edge thickness and radius  (see Figure 5) , and two more 
  
Final Report AO -2015 -001 
<< Page 15 >>
 were at the minimum limit for on e or o ther dimension.  The dimensions of the blade  that 
was new when installed in May 2013 met the required specifications.  
 
Figure 5

(With  measurements of trailing edge thickness and radius.  Source: P&WC Service Investigation Report)  
4.2.3.  During the overhaul, the blade had required repair  in accordance with the P&WC -approved 
supplier process MPP1, based on document  725009 -SRR-001.  This document did not 
require the measurement of repaired blades in  all of the dimension s specifi ed by P&WC for 
the acceptance of new blades , although  there had always been a verification of the 
minimum trailing edge thickness  for blades that had been through a strip an d recoat 
process . 
4.2.4.  Engine turbine blades must endure very high temperatures and centrifugal loads ; therefore 
the blades are manufactured to strict specifications.  Under -size blades will erode or stretch, 
which can lead to their failing before  reaching the next inspection .  Of the eight compressor 
turbine blade remnants sampled  from this set , two were under -size and another two were at 
the minimum size for a critical dimension.  
4.2.5.  An operator will usually make a commercial decision  on whether to install new or overhauled 
turbine blades.  However, the use of overhauled components, or  the introduction of  an 
engine overhaul extension programme like th is STC, could  introduce new risks for an 
operato r.  It is a safety issue  that the specifi cations for compressor turbine blades that had 
been through a strip and recoat process were not as well defined as those for new blades , 
and that ov erhauled blades might fail to r each the stated  inspection interval s.  The issue 
was of particular importance to operators of single -engine aircraft.  
4.2.6.  P&WC noted that dimensional differences could arise for blades that had been repaired 
during overhaul: that is, had been stripped, repaired and then recoated.  It submitted th at 
blade durability after that process had been acceptable, as shown by [past] field experience . 
4.2.7.  P&WC subsequently revised Repair Requirement Document 725009 -SRR-001, for all of its 
PT6 engines, so that  the trailing edge thickness measurement  requirements match ed those 
for new compressor turbine blades . 
4.2.8.  When  asked about the implications of this investigation for other engines that were 
presently in service with overhauled compressor turbine blades , P&WC  replied  that further 
intervention would not improve fl eet reliability.  Its response was , in part:  
Pratt & Whitney Canada has assessed the risk of further occurrences of this 
nature on the basis of the number of events and the time accrued on similarly 
repaired components over the service history of the affec ted fleet.   Future risk 
of significant events related to fracture of under -dimensional, recoat ed blades 
was determined to be well within acceptable parameters (as defined by 
available Guidance Material).  Additional field intervention would be deemed to 


<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 be neither effective nor warranted at this point with respect to measurably 
improving fleet reliability.26 
4.2.9.  The flight manual has operating limits for engine speed and temperature , which  pilots must 
observe in order to protect the engine from sudden or cumulative damage that will shorten  
the lives of turbine  component s.  In general, the higher the power settings, the shorter the 
turbine life.  The mission profile review conducted by P&WC and Pacific Aerospace found 
that skydiving operators tended to have a higher frequency of operating cycles27 than was 
originally assumed, and that would also affect directly the lives of engine components.  
4.2.10.  Approximately 15 months after the overhauled turbine module was installed, the operator 
raised the take -off torque  setting  but retained the turbine temperature limit .  Both settings 
remained at or below the flight manual limits.  The operator’s engine handling procedure, 
even allowing for  the high frequency of operatin g cycles in the skydiving role, would not have 
affected unduly the durability of the compressor turbine blades  had all of the blades  
conformed to the correct specifications for acceptance after repair . 
Findings  
1. The first compressor turbine blade failed aft er a fatigue crack, which had 
begun at the trailing edge, propagated towards the leading edge .  The blade  
finally fractured in tensile overload.  The separated blade fragment caused 
other blades to fracture and the engine to stop.  
2. The fatigue crack in the trailing edge of the blade was likely initiated by the 
trailing edge radius having been  below the specification for a new blade.  
3. The P&WC Repair Requirement Document 725009 -SRR-001, at the time the 
blades were overhauled, had gener ic requirements for trailing edge thickness 
inspections but did not specify a minimum measurement for the trailing edge 
radius.  
4. The higher engine power settings used by the operator since August 2014 
were within the flight manual limits.  Therefore it was unlikely that the 
operator’s engine handling policy contributed to the engine failure.  
4.3. Maintenance practices  
Safety issue:  When aircraft maintenance staff do not refer to the current Instructions for 
Continuing Airworthiness  for a task, perhaps because they are very familiar with  the basic 
task and do not know that  the task documentation has changed,  safety might be  
compromised . 
Engine inspections  
4.3.1.  In 2003 P&WC had amended an inspection procedure to improve the early detection of 
cracks in the compressor turbine  blades.28  The original procedure had called for a 
borescope to be inserted into the fuel nozzle port in the combustion module casing to look 
for heat distress on the upstream29 side of the compressor turbine  disk.  The amendment 
recommended that the  borescope be inserted through the exhaust duct also, to inspect the 
downstream  side of the disk and the trailing edge of the turbine blades.  The lower, 
overlapping, part of the compressor turbine blades, where cracks had been found in other 
engines , could be inspected only by viewing the  blades  from the exhaust port .  The amended

<< Page 17 >>
 procedure had been  first added to the engine maintenance manual in 2006 .  The Service 
Letter had been  revised and reissued in July 2013.  
4.3.2.  Since 2004, P&WC had issued further Servi ce Information Letters and Service Bulletins to 
draw attention to the detrimental effects of engine over -temperature events on the turbine 
section, and how careful engine handling and proper maintenance procedures could 
prevent this damage.  Appendix 1 has  a summary of the information provided by P&WC.  
4.3.3.  The engine failure occurred 87 flight hours after the previous scheduled maintenance , 
which included a borescope inspection of the compressor turbine blades.  However, when 
engineers of the maintenance provider were inspect ing other PT6 A-34 engines soon after 
the accident , the P&WC representative  observed that the engineers  did not  follow fully the 
borescope requirement  to inspect  the downstream ( forward ) side of the compressor turbine 
disk. 
4.3.4.  P&WC did not attempt to estimate t he rate of propagation of the fatigue crack in the 
compressor turbine  blade .  Therefore it is not known whether the crack could  have been 
present, and potentially detectable, at the time of the scheduled borescope inspection.  The 
P&WC representative suggested that a borescope operator ought to be able to see a crack 
of five millimetres or more in length.  P&WC informed the Commission that the published 
300-hour inspection interval remain ed satisfactory for detectin g cracks in compressor 
turbine  blade s. 
4.3.5.  The Commission has discussed previously  the issue of staff  relying on their memory or 
habitual procedures when performing maintenance, and not referring to  and following 
current procedure s in a manual.30  Manufacturers  publish many amendments to manuals 
and Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness , of which some might not  reach ‘frontline’ 
staff.  If staff do not check t hat they are using the current procedure s for tasks related to 
airworthiness , the intent of the procedure s can be undermined and safety compromised . 
4.3.6.  The maintenance provider has confirmed, since the accident, that it conducts fully the 
inspection requirements of the engine maintenance manual.   It has also chosen not to use 
overhauled compressor turbi ne blades  in the future . 
Skydiving mission profile  
4.3.7.  Following the review of the skydiving mission profile, P&WC gave attention to the continued 
airworthiness of applicable engines.  It advised that its analysis had determined that  there 
was a need to improv e some maintenance requirements.  It said, in part : 
Repetitive short missions with the majority of its length in the high end of the 
allowed power ratings reinforces the need to introduce better creep resistant 
compressor turbine blades … for skydiving mis sions. For engines pre-SB1690 
configuration used in skydive operation, a [hot section inspection] requirement 
will be added to improve compressor turbine blade reliability to reach [stated 
time between overhaul].31 
The MORE registration process  
4.3.8.  Although the  operator had purchased the right to use the MORE maintenance programme, 
MORE did not know that the operator was doing so, because registration of the engines had 
not been  completed.  Therefore  MORE would not have advised the operator of changes to 
the programme.  If a maintenance provider were not aware of changes to an engine 
maintenance programme, the continuing airworthiness of that engine could be affected.  
                                                        
30 For example, see Report  11-004, Piper PA31 -350 Navajo Chieftain, ZK -MYS, landing without nose landing 
gear extended, Nelson Aerodrome, 11 May 2011.  
31 Email , Pacific Aerospace, 10 March 2016. SB1690 is Service Bulletin 1690; see Appendix 1, paragraph 3.  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 4.3.9.  In this case there had been  no ch anges to the MORE programme for the engine between the 
operator’s assumed registration in 2009 and the day of the accident.  Fortunately, if there 
had been changes, the maintenance provider would have been aware of them, because it 
maintained another 750XL  engine of the operator under the same STC.32 
4.3.10.  MORE had 12 engines (on nine aeroplanes) in New Zealand registered for this STC.  As at 
June 2015 the register was more than 50% inaccurate as to aeroplane type and 
registration.  One likely reason was that oper ators did not always advise sales of 
participating engines to MORE, as required by the STC.  
4.3.11.  Compliance with the registration and applicable requirements of an approved  STC is a 
condition  for the continuing airworthiness  of an aircraft or product . 
Findings  
5. The operator had maintained the engine in accordance with an approved, 
alternative maintenance programme, but the registration of the engine into 
that programme had not been  completed.  The administrative oversight did 
not affect the reliability of the eng ine or contribute to the blade failure.  
6. It was likely that the maintenance provider had not followed fully the engine 
manufacturer’s recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor 
turbine blades.  It could not be determined whether the crack might hav e 
been present, and potentially detectable, at the most recent borescope 
inspection.  
4.4. Survivability aspects  
Safety issue:  Parachute drop pilot s were not required to wear lifejacket s or flotation device s 
if their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land.  That scenario  
downplayed  the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to  use the 
emergency parachute when over or near water . 
Tandem pairs  
4.4.1.  The last tandem pair to leave the aeropl ane estimated that the bale-out took up to 20 
seconds.  There was some delay after the call to “Get out! ”, caused by tandem masters 
having to ensure that the y were attached to the ir riders correctly  and by one pair having to 
release their aeroplane restrai nt.33  The last tandem pair had to wait for the pilot and his 
deployed chute to clear the rear door.  
4.4.2.  The tandem masters estimated that they had all left the aeroplane by about 1,500 ft above 
the lake, deploying their reserve parachutes by 1,000 ft.  Parachu ting rules required reserve 
parachute s to be deployed for tandem jump s from less than 5,000 ft above ground, 
because the reserve parachutes inflate d more rapidly than main parachutes.  
4.4.3.  Each of the tandem riders was equipped with a lifejacket34, but the operator did not require 
the tandem masters to wear lifejackets because  the operator expected that , under normal 
circumstances, the reserve parachutes w ould provide sufficient buoyancy.  Following the 
accident the operator provided its tandem masters with flotation device s. 
                                                        
32 The operator had fulfilled the MORE® regist ration requirements for the other 750XL in June 2010.  
33 Restraint belts were fitted even though Civil Aviation Rule 91.505(b) exempted a person engaged in 
parachute operations from the requirement to have a seat, berth, safety belt or restraining belt.  
34 As required by  Civil Aviation Rule 105.57.  
  
Final Report AO -2015 -001 
<< Page 19 >>
 The pilot  
4.4.4.  Parachute drop pilots are required to wear emergency parachute s on every skydiving 
flight.35  The operator had given the pilot ground -based training, but did not require its pilots 
to complete actual parachute descent s.  The pilot had not parachuted previously.  
4.4.5.  The pilot could not recall having inspected the emergency parachute before putting it on 
that morning.  He later said that he had never performed a pre -flight inspection of the 
parachute  himself .  The maintenance record  for the parachute w as found to be in order.36 
4.4.6.  The operator did not equip its pilots with lifejacket s and was not required to do so, because 
its flight s from Taupō  that used the Taupō  aerodrome parachute landing area remain ed 
within gliding distance of land  at all times.37  This was a safety issue, because the scenario  
downplayed  the possibility of a pilot hav ing to make a ditching, or bale out and drift to a 
water landing.  In this case it was fortuitous that none of the parachutists or the pilot landed 
in the lake.  A recommendation was made to the operator to investigate options for 
provid ing its drop pilots with flotation device s. 
4.4.7.  Pilots are trained to put their aeroplane s into a gliding descent if they have to make a forced 
landing.  The pilot, with minimal experience of the 750XL and parachuting operations, 
determined that he could not reach a suitable area on land.  Although ditching in the lake 
was an option, he was aware that the flig ht manual warned that the aeroplane’s ditching 
characteristics were unknown .  Therefore he chose to abandon the aeroplane.  
4.4.8.  The operator trained its pilots to bale out of the cabin rear door after others had gone, and 
to pull the emergency parachute ripcord  when clear of the aeroplane.  However, i t was  
acknowledged that not all emergency situations were foreseeable , and a pilot might have to 
bale out  in a manner contrary to their training.  
4.4.9.  The pilot  did not intend to bale out before the last of the parachuti sts.  However,  by doing so 
he left the aeroplane uncontrolled , and it began to roll and dive shortly afterwards .  If 
anyone still on board  had had difficult y exiting the aeroplane , their survivability could have 
been jeopardised by the aeroplane’s rapidly changing  attitude.   In this case the proximity to 
people and property also meant that the unoccupied aeroplane was a threat.  
4.4.10.  The operator suggested t hat it was likely that the pilot did not s ee in the cockpit mirror that 
there were people in the cabin , bec ause the dark -coloured jumpsuits they were wearing 
merged with th e dark cabin rear bulkhead.  T he operator took action to improve the colour 
contrast between the cabin rear bulkhead and the  jumpsuits . 
4.4.11.  By baling out through the cockpit door before everyone else had left the aeroplane, the pilot  
risked a collision or entanglement with the last tandem pair who exited from the rear door.  
He also risked colliding with the tail plane  because he  did not wait until he was clear of the 
aeroplane to deploy his parachute .  Either  mishap could have led to serious or fatal injuries.   
If he had exited through the cabin rear door  he would have been sure t hat he was the last to 
leave and would not have put others at risk.  
Training of p arachute  drop pilots  for emergenc ies 
4.4.12.  The chief pilot and chief parachute instructor were jointly responsible for training drop pilots 
in the use of emergency parachute s and in emergency procedures .  The pilot’s  training 
record , signed by the instructor and counter -signed by the pilot,  indicated that this 
comprehensive training had been  done.   However, his  hasty exit through the cockpit door 
                                                        
35 Passengers on a skydiving flight who are not engaged in a parachute operation  are also required to wear 
emergency parachutes . 
36 Civil Aviation Rules required maintenance records for parachutes, as they are a type of aircraft.  
37 As permitted by Civil Aviation Rule 91.525 . 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 before everyone else had baled out , and his immediate deployment of the parachute , were  
contrary to what he had been instructed . 
4.4.13.  The pilot’s reaction was understandable given  that the e ngine failure  happened on his first 
day of solo flying in the role  and at a relatively low height .  However, his training had been 
completed so recently that the correct procedures , if they had been thoroughly un derstood,  
should have been fresh in his mind . 
4.4.14.  Civil Aviation Rule 91.705 made drop pilots responsible for ensuring that each person 
carried in their aircraft, other than a person intending to make a parachute descent, wa s 
trained in the use of their emerge ncy parachute and was briefed on the method to be used 
for exiting the aircraft (see Appendix 2).   Rule 91.707 implied that a pilot was responsible 
for ensuring that their  emergency parachute (and any other emergency parachutes carried) 
were serviceable , at the least by inspecting the parachute packing card.  
4.4.15.  In order to be able to comply with these Rule requirements, p arachute drop pilots must have 
a thorough understanding of the emergency procedures  applicable to their aircraft .  Training 
in emergency pr ocedures typically requires rote learning so that one’s response to an 
emergency is instinctive and correct.   The pilot’s response to the engine failure , along  with 
his later comment that he had n ever personally inspected the emergency parachute , 
indicated  that he had not fully understood  the procedures.  Therefore it was likely  that his 
emergency training had not been  adequate . 
4.4.16.  The operator advised that, since the accident, it had  added a voluntary tandem jump to the 
parachute drop pilot training, and include a group training session with tandem masters as 
part of the annual competency testing for pilots.    
Findings  
7. The operator had not equipped its pilots with flotation device s to cover  the 
possibility of a ditching or an emergency bale -out over or nea r water.  
8. The pilot had demonstrated that he was competent and he had the required 
ratings.  However, it was likely that the operator’s training of the pilot in 
emergency procedures was inadequate .  This contributed to the pilot  making 
a hasty exit from the  aeroplane that jeopardised others.  
  
  
Final Report AO -2015 -001 
<< Page 21 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. The first compressor turbine blade failed after a fatigue crack, which had begun at the 
trailing edge, propagated towards the leading edge .  The blade  finally fractured in tensile 
overload.  The separated blade fragment caused other blade s to fracture and the engine to 
stop. 
5.2. The fatigue crack in the trailing edge of the blade was likely initiated by the trailing edge 
radius having been  below the specification for a new blade.  
5.3. The P&WC Repair Requirement Doc ument 725009 -SRR-001, at the time  the blades were 
overhauled, had generic requirements for trailing edge thickness inspections but did not 
specify a minimum measurement for the trailing edge radius.  
5.4. The higher engine power settings used by the operator sin ce August 2014 were within the 
flight manual limits.  Therefore it was unlikely that the operator’s engine handling policy 
contributed to the engine failure . 
5.5. The operator had maintained the engine in accordance with an approved, alternative 
maintenance pro gramme, but the registration of the engine into that programme had not 
been completed .  The administrative oversight did not affect the reliability of the engine or 
contribute to the blade failure.  
5.6. It was likely that the maintenance provider had not follow ed fully the engine manufacturer’s 
recommended procedure for inspecti ng the compressor turbine blades.  It could  not be 
determined whether the crack might have been present, and potentially detectable, at the 
most recent  borescope inspection.  
5.7. The operator had not equipped its pilots with flotation device s to cover  the possibility of a 
ditching or an emergency bale -out over or near water.  
5.8. The pilot had demonstrated that he was competent and he had the required ratings.  
However, it was likely th at the operator’s training of the pilot in emergency procedures was 
inadequate .  This contributed to the pilot  making a hasty exit from the aeroplane that 
jeopardised others .

 Final Report AO -2015 -001 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1. The Commission  classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues 
identified by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the 
Commission issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues 
that would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Following  the accident, t he operator paint ed the  rear bulkheads of its aeroplanes  white , 
which allowed pilots to see cabin occupants  more easily  in the cockpit rear-view mirror.  
6.3. To improve  the preparedness of drop pilots for an emergency parachute descent, the 
operator has since added a voluntary tandem jump to the parachute drop pilot training.  A 
group training session with tandem masters is also included in the annual competency 
testing for pilots.  
6.4. The operator now provides lifejacket s for its tandem masters.  
6.5. On 5 January 2016  P&WC advised that it had issued Revision 24 to the Repair Requirement 
Document 725009 -SRR-001, for all PT6 engines, to reflect the dimension requirements of 
new compressor turbine  blades. 
Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
6.6. On 9 February 2017 P&WC advised that, a s a result of the 750XL/PT6A -34 mission profile 
review showing that skydiving operators were, on average, using higher power settings for 
longer durations, the PT6A engine maintenance manual would be revised to require 
enhanced inspections of all single -engine applications in the skydiving  role.  The revision 
was expected to be published in April 2017.  
 
 
 
 
  
  
Final Report AO -2015 -001

 7. Recommendation  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or 
organisation that it considers the most appropriat e to address the identified safety issues, 
depending on whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the 
wider transport sector.   As a result of this inquiry, the Commission made a recommendation 
to Skydive Taupo.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that the recommendation be implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. Skydive Taupo did not equip its parachute drop pilots with lifejacket s and was not required 
to do so, because its flights from Taupō  aerodrome, which used the Taupō  aerodrome 
parachute landing area, remained within gliding distance of land at all times.  This accident 
illustrated how that scenario  downplayed  the pos sibility of a pilot having to ditch an 
aeroplane , or bale out and drift to a water landing.  
7.4. Therefore the Commission is recommending that the Chief Executive of Skydive Taupo 
investigate options for equip ping their parachute drop pilots with effective flotation device s.  
(018/17)  
7.5. On 11 July 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of Skydive Taupo replied, in part:  
I confirm I intend to implement the final recommendation in relation to 
equipping drop pilots with an e ffective flotation device.  A Quality Action 
Request has been raised through the Skydive Taupo Ltd Quality Assurance 
system to address this…Once the suitable flotation equipment has been 
confirmed and made fit for purpose, pilot training will be introduced  and 
conducted regarding water landing procedures.  The recommendation will be 
fully implemented by the 31st of August 2017.  
 
  

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -001 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Operators and pilots engaged in skydiving operations should assess carefully the risk of 
having to use an emergency parachute or land ing in water , and ensure that they have the 
appropriate training and equipment .  Pilots must have a thorough understanding of the care 
and use of emergency parachutes, as their lives depend on them . 
8.2. Aircraft m aintenance engineers should no t commence any task related to airworthiness 
without ensuring that they have the current procedure and information necessary for the 
task.  
8.3. Operators and maintenance providers should ensure that they comply fully with any 
registration or other requirements of approved STCs.

 Final Report AO -2015 -001 Appendix 1: P&WC information on engine over -temperature events  
1. In 2004 P &WC issued Service Information Letter PT6A -125 outlining the detrimental effects 
of engine over -temperature events.  The letter described compressor turbine  blade ‘creep’38 
and gave recommendations for better engine handling, including the recovery action that 
pilots should take in the event of an over -temperature.  
2. In 2010 P&WC issued Service Information Letter GEN PT6A -028, applicable to all its turbine 
engines.  This letter explained that an engine operated beyond the recommended power 
limits would experience hot section distress.  This would accelerate the deterioration of power 
margins39 and reduce the engine reliability and durability.  
3. In 2011 P&WC issued Service Bulletin  1690 to introduce ‘single -crystal’40 compressor turbine  
blades as an improvement to PT6A -34-series engines.    
4. In 2013 P&WC issued Service Information Letter PT6A -146R1 to further draw attention to 
concerns relating to compressor turbine  blade maintenance,  engine handling and hot section 
distress.  
5. In 2014 P&WC issued Service Information Letter GEN PT6A -219 describing how single -crystal 
compressor turbine  blades had fractured before  delivery.  It recommended revert ing to an 
older standard of blade or conduc ting borescope inspections at specified intervals.  Service 
Bulletin 1742 followed shortly afterwards, requiring the replacement of single -crystal blades 
with non -single -crystal blades.  
6. In 2015 Service Bulletin 1767 introduced an improved single -crystal co mpressor turbine  
blade.  
7. On 11 November 2016 P&WC issued Service Information Letter PT6A -250 outlining the 
benefits of single -crystal compressor turbine blades as per Service Bulletin 1767.  The letter 
explained that single -crystal compressor turbine blades  offered a number of advantages, 
including enhanced tolerance to creep and reduced maintenance due to exemptions from 
certain inspections.  
  
                                                        
38 Creep is the detrimental effect on material properties, which is dependent on the material and the following 
parameters: time, temperature and stress. An increase in temperature or stress can result in a decreased time 
before creep occurs . 
39 The margin is the difference between an engine parameter value (for example, inter -turbine temperature) that 
is required to achieve a specified power output under certain conditions and the maximum permitted value of 
that parameter.  As the engine components wear, and under more adverse conditions, the margin decreases .   
40 Blades manufactured with a material and  design with increased resistance to heat stress and creep.
