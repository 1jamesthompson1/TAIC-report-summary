","0.0","5.0","The pilot's decision to bail out through the cockpit window rather than the cabin rear door, and deploying his parachute immediately, indicates a potential breakdown in communication and crew resource management. ""The pilot unwittingly jeopardised the evacuation by baling out through his cockpit window rather than from the cabin rear door, and by deploying his parachute immediately"" (4.1.3). However, this was not the primary cause of the accident but rather a factor in the evacuation process.
","0.0","15.0","The pilot's inadequate training in emergency procedures contributed to the evacuation issues. ""His actions were very likely due to natural anxiety and also, in part, to inadequate training in emergency procedures by the operator"" (4.1.3). Additionally, the pilot's training in emergency procedures was likely inadequate, contributing to his hasty exit that jeopardized others (4.4.15, 4.4.16, 5.8).
","0.0","40.0","The primary cause of the accident was a fractured compressor turbine blade due to maintenance issues. ""A fractured compressor turbine blade caused the engine failure"" (4.1.1). The overhauled blades did not meet the same specifications as new blades, and critical dimensions were not verified (4.2, 4.2.5). Additionally, the maintenance provider likely did not follow the engine manufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor turbine blades (5.6).
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of fire detection or suppression systems being a factor in the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.
","0.0","10.0","The operator's administrative oversight in not completing the registration of the engine into the approved alternative maintenance programme did not affect the reliability of the engine or contribute to the blade failure (5.5). However, the issue of maintenance staff not referring to current Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness could compromise safety (4.3.5).
","0.0","1.667","There is no mention of situational awareness issues contributing to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.
","2.887","20.0","The design and specifications of the overhauled compressor turbine blades were identified as a safety issue. The blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process did not have the same measurement specifications as new blades, which could lead to premature failure (4.2, 4.2.5).
","0.0","3.333","While risk assessment and management are not directly cited as a cause, the lack of verification of critical dimensions for overhauled blades indicates a potential shortfall in risk management practices (4.2.5). Additionally, the operator's decision to use higher engine power settings within flight manual limits did not contribute to the engine failure, suggesting that risk assessment was conducted for this change (5.4).

","0.0","5.0","The fatigue crack in the trailing edge of the blade was likely initiated by the trailing edge radius being below the specification for a new blade, which is a direct issue of structural integrity and material fatigue (5.2, 5.3).
