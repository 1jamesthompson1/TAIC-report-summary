2015_001,018/17,"Skydive Taupo did not equip its parachute drop pilots with lifejackets and was not required to do so, because its flights from TaupÅ aerodrome, which used the TaupÅ aerodrome parachute landing area, remained within gliding distance of land at all times. This accident illustrated how that scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane, or bale out and drift to a water landing.

Therefore the Commission is recommending that the Chief Executive of Skydive Taupo investigate options for equipping their parachute drop pilots with effective flotation devices.",,"The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same as those for new blades. Blades that had been through that repair process, without verification of critical dimensions, might fail before the next 3,000-hour inspection.

That scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane or having to use the emergency parachute when over or near water.
