- 'the vessel''s bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a common passage plan before the pilotage began. Consequently, the pilot and the vessel''s bridge team had different understandings of the planned track to be followed and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan.


  the IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessels must adhere to, but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and use to meet those same standards.


  the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred.


  the standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice.'
