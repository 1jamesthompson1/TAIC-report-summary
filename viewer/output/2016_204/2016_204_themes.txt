Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of shared understanding: The bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the passage plan, leading to different understandings of the planned track and roles in monitoring against the plan.
2. Inadequate monitoring: The crew did not effectively monitor the vessel's progress, particularly due to incorrect configuration of the ECDIS and reliance on visual references instead of utilizing all available means.
3. Deficiencies in passage planning: There were issues with the passage plans created by the port authorities, as they did not meet the same standards as those required for vessel passage planning.
4. Lack of effective bridge resource management: The standard of bridge resource management on board the vessel did not meet industry good practice, leading to a breakdown in communication and coordination among the bridge team.
5. Failure to speak up: Both the master and the officer of the watch noticed the vessel deviating from the intended track but did not speak up, missing an opportunity to prevent the grounding.
6. Inadequate ECDIS configuration: The ECDIS was not correctly configured for navigation in a narrow channel, resulting in incorrect safety settings and ineffective use of the system.
