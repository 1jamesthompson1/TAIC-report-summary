- name: Passage Planning
  explanation: Passage planning is the process of developing a comprehensive, step-by-step navigational plan from berth to berth, including any necessary course changes, speed adjustments, and considerations for environmental conditions. This theme is relevant to the accident because the vessel's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a common passage plan before the pilotage began, leading to different understandings of the planned track and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan. "Consequently, the pilot and the vessel's bridge team had different understandings of the planned track to be followed and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan" (4.1.2). Additionally, the IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessels must adhere to, but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and use to meet those same standards (4.1.2).
- name: Bridge Resource Management (BRM)
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) refers to the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. This theme is significant in the context of the accident because the standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice. "The standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice" (4.1.2). The bridge team, including the pilot, did not effectively monitor the vessel's progress, and there was a lack of communication and challenge among the team members, which could have prevented the grounding (4.5.1, 4.5.6).
- name: Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) Configuration
  explanation: The Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) is a computer-based navigation system that complies with IMO regulations and can be used as an alternative to paper navigation charts. The relevance of this theme to the accident is highlighted by the fact that the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred. "The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred" (4.1.2). The ECDIS safety settings were not appropriate for the intended passage into Port Otago, and the cross-track distance alarm would not activate until the vessel was significantly outside the channel (4.4.4).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness involves the perception of environmental elements, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. It is a critical component of safe navigation. In this accident, the grounding occurred because the bridge team, including the pilot, lost situational awareness and did not realize that the vessel had deviated so far starboard of the intended track. "The grounding occurred because the bridge team, including the pilot, lost situational awareness and did not realise that the vessel had deviated so far starboard of the intended track" (5.1). The pilot and bridge team were not effectively monitoring the vessel's progress by all available means, contributing to the loss of situational awareness (5.2).
- name: Pilot Integration into Bridge Team
  explanation: The integration of a pilot into the bridge team is crucial for ensuring that the pilot and the vessel's officers work together effectively during pilotage. This theme is relevant because, in this case, the pilot was not fully integrated into the bridge organization, which affected the cohesion of the team and their shared understanding of the passage plan. "At this stage the pilot needs to be fully integrated into the bridge organisation so that the whole team works as a cohesive body and has a shared understanding of the passage plan" (4.3.1). The lack of a shared understanding and the absence of the OOW and helmsman from the briefing with the pilot contributed to the ineffective BRM (4.5.2).
- name: Communication and Challenge
  explanation: Effective communication and the willingness to challenge decisions are key aspects of a well-functioning bridge team. This theme is relevant to the accident because there was a failure in communication and challenge among the bridge team members. Neither the master nor the officer of the watch spoke up when they noticed the vessel was off track, missing an opportunity to avert the grounding. "Neither the master nor the officer of the watch speaking up when they both noticed that the vessel was to starboard of the track according to their passage plan was a lost opportunity to avert the grounding" (5.5). The pilot also expressed that he was working very much on his own, indicating a lack of active engagement from the bridge team (4.5.5).
