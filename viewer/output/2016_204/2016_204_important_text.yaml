  \ for however short a time, is a serious occurrence that can cause  damage \nto\
  \ the vessel and the environment.  \n4.1.2.  Many large vessels successfully complete\
  \ the transit of  the Upper Harbour under pilotage \nevery year.  The following\
  \ analysis discusses  why on this occasion the vessel grounded.   It also \ndiscusses\
  \ four safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 the vessel 's bridge team and the pilot did not\
  \ have a shared understanding of a \ncommon passage plan before the pilotage began.\
  \  Consequently the pilot and the \nvessel 's bridge team had different understanding\
  \ s of the planned track to be followed \nand their respective roles in monitoring\
  \ against the plan  \n\uF0B7 the IMO has set standards for passage planning that\
  \ vessel s must adhere to , but \nthere is no corresponding requirement for the\
  \ passage plans that pilots create and \nuse to meet those same standards  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the\
  \ IMO \nand company standards when the grounding occurred  \n\uF0B7 the standard\
  \ of  BRM  on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago pilotage did not meet \ngood\
  \ industry practice . \n4.1.3.  The length of the  Molly Manx  was the maximum permitted\
  \  for a vessel  transit ing the Upper \nHarbour , and with a draught of 7.1 m there\
  \ was little margin for error . This meant  it was \nimportant for the transit to\
  \ be carefully managed and monitored by the bridge team.  \n4.1.4.  The vessel was\
  \ correctly certified and was manned with crew in excess of the safe manning \n\
  certificate .  The pilot who joined the vessel off the harbour entrance held a pilot's\
  \ licence  that \nwas current for piloting a vessel  of the type and size of the\
  \ Molly Manx  in that port .   \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The pilot had successfully\
  \ piloted the vessel from beyond the entrance to Otago Harbour  and \nwas maintain\
  \ ing a speed that would allow him to berth the Molly Manx  within the available\
  \ \ntidal window.  As the vessel approached Port Chalmers , the pilot reduced the\
  \ speed of the \nvessel as the two tugs arrived to assist .  One tug proceeded ahead\
  \ of the vessel while the \nother was secured to  the stern.   Having the  tug secured\
  \ to  the stern would have allow ed the \npilot to use it as a means of reducing\
  \ speed or to  assist with steering .  The speed of the vessel  \nand the configuration\
  \ of the assisting tugs were appropriate for the passage between the \nHalfway Islands.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  The Molly Manx  passed Port Chalmers and a log storage area and storage\
  \ sheds .  The ebb \ntide as shown on the chart  (see Figure 3)  would normally\
  \  have  push ed (set15) the vessel  from \nleft to right (port to starboard) as\
  \ the vessel  approached the narrows .  However, the Otago \nHarbour pilots were\
  \ aware that during an ebb tide the vessel  would be  first affected by the \ntidal\
  \ stream emanating from behind Goat Island that would set the vessel  from right\
  \ to left \n(starboard to port) .  It was for this reason  that the pilot was comfortable\
  \ with being to \nstarboard of the planned track as the vessel  was passing the\
  \ storage sheds , in anticipation of \nthe vessel  being set back onto the planned\
  \ track before navigating between the islands.  \n4.2.3.  When  the vessel  passed\
  \  the storage s heds , the pilot ordered starboard helm to start the turn \ninto\
  \ the channel to pass between Quarantine and Goat Island s and to counteract his\
  \ \nprediction that there would be a strong set from right to left  from the ebb\
  \ tide  flowing  between \nGoat Island and the Port Chalmers peninsula  (see Figure\
  \ 3) .   \n4.2.4.  The pilot was standing at the front of the navigating bridge\
  \ either on the centreline of the \nvessel or one or two paces to starboard .  From\
  \ his position he  could see clear ly down the \n                              \
  \                          \n15 Be pushed towards - set towards . \nFinal Report\
  \ MO -2016 -204 \n<< Page 12 >>\n channel between the islands  and the leading line\
  \ beacons beyond .  From his position he was \nnot able to see either the radar\
  \ or the ECDIS screen .  He was navigating the vessel by eye with \nan occasional\
  \ check on the vessel 's speed  log readout on the panel above the forward bridge\
  \ \nwindows .   \n4.2.5.  Using data downloaded from the vessel 's voyage data recorder\
  \  it was possible to calculate the \nvessel 's heading and match that to the true\
  \ course and speed over the ground  at the time \n(see Figure 2.  The data show\
  \ ed that from  0734 :20 the tidal stream between Goat Island and \nPort Chalmers\
  \ did set the vessel  from right to left as predicted by the pilot.  However , the\
  \ pilot \nadjusted the heading of the vessel  to counter this set and the vessel\
  \  remained to  starboard of \nthe planned track.  \n4.2.6.  The vessel  then enter\
  \ ed the area where it began to be set in the opposite direction, from left \nto\
  \ right, the n move d further to starboard of the planned track . \n4.2.7.  The\
  \ pilot made a succession of helm orders for 5 , 10 and then 15 degrees of port\
  \ helm and \nthen ordered the helm to \"amidships \" in anticipation of the change\
  \ in direction of the tidal set .  \nThe pilot then noticed that  the vessel was\
  \ to starboard of the line of the leading beacon s.  He \nordered 5 then 10 degrees\
  \ of port  helm and then ordered the helm to amidships.  \n4.2.8.  However,  although\
  \ the bow of the vessel  was pointing towards the gap between the islands, \nthe\
  \ vessel  was still too far to starboard of the  planned track , and the bow of\
  \ the vessel  \nentered the area of shallow wa ter inside of Goat Island and grounded.\
  \  The momentum of the \nvessel  carried it over the shallow water, causing it to\
  \ swing to starboard (see Figure 5). \n4.2.9.  Until the pilot felt the vessel grounding,\
  \ he had not appreciated how far to starboard of the \nplanned tr ack the vessel\
  \  was.  He had lost awareness of exactly where the vessel  was in the \nchannel\
  \ and the influence that the tide was having on its progress.  The  risk of this\
  \ happening \nis high when navigating large vessel s in narrow channels  using only\
  \ visual references to \nmonitor the vessel s' progress.  It is why all available\
  \ means by all available persons should be \nused to monitor the progress of a vessel\
  \  along its planned track.  These points are discussed \nin more detail in the\
  \ following sections.  \n4.2.10.  The pilot realised that  something was wrong when\
  \ he , along with the rest of the bridge team , \nfelt a bump .  He noticed that\
  \ the speed of the vessel was slowing and the vessel's bow was \nswing ing to starboard\
  \ despite  his havin g just applied port hel m.  He realised from these \nindicators\
  \ that the vessel was grounding  and immediately ordered the engine  to stop and\
  \ then \nastern and for the tug secured aft to pull right aft .  In doing so the\
  \  pilot was able  to manoeuvre \nthe vessel off the bank and back into  deeper\
  \ water . \nFinding s \n1. The grounding occurred because the bridge team , including\
  \ the pilot , lost \nsituational awareness and did not realise that the vessel \
  \ had deviated so far \nstarboard of the intended track . \n2. The bridge team ,\
  \ including the pilot , did not realise how far the vessel  had \ndeviated from\
  \ the intended track because they were not monitoring the vessel 's \nprogress effectively\
  \ and by all available means . \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -204 \n<< Page 13 >>\n\

  << Page 14 >>\n 4.3. Passage planning  \nSafety issue: The vessel 's bridge team\
  \ and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of  a \ncommon passage plan\
  \ before the pilotage began.  Consequently,  the pilot and the vessel 's \nbridge\
  \ team had different understanding s of the planned track to be followed and their\
  \ \nrespective roles in monitoring against the plan.  \nSafety issue : The IMO has\
  \ set standards for passage planning that vessel s must adhere to, \nbut there is\
  \ no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that port authorities  create\
  \ \nand use to meet those same standards . \n4.3.1.  When a pilot joins a vessel\
  \ prior to the pilotage it is the first opportunity for the master and \nbridge\
  \ team to : talk to the pilot; clarify any issues that may have been identified\
  \ during the \npreparation of the passage plan; and ensure they are satisfied with\
  \ the planned transit.  At \nthis stage the pilot needs to be fully integrated into\
  \ the bridge organisation so that the whole \nteam works as a cohesive body and\
  \ has a shared understanding  of the p assage plan . \n4.3.2.  Before any pilotage\
  \ act begins, it is essential that the pilot and the master (including other \n\
  members of the team) have a shared understanding of  the passage plan.  That did\
  \ not happen \nin this case.  As often happens, the pilot intended  to na vigate\
  \ to the standard port company \npassage plan , and the vessel  had its own passage\
  \ plan, which  differed  from that of the port \ncompany . \n4.3.3.  An essential\
  \ part of integrating the pilot into the bridge team is the pilot and master exchange\
  \ \nof information, a briefing that should include all members of the bridge team.\
  \  The briefing is a \nbilateral exchange of important information where everyone\
  \ is made aware of : any changes to \nthe proposed plan ; the handling characteristics\
  \ of the vessel ; and any notable 'dyna mic' \ninformation such as weather and tides\
  \  for the transit.   \n4.3.4.  The port passage plan was available over the internet\
  \ from the Port Otago  website .  The \nchannel is narrow and there is little scope\
  \ for deviating from the plan without leaving the \nnavigational c hannel.  The\
  \ preferred courses were presented as  smooth , curved lines without \nany marked\
  \ waypoints, turn radii or off -track limits.  Without that information the vessel\
  \ 's crew \nwould not have been  able to replicate it in their own navigation systems,\
  \ such a s the ECDIS .  \nThe vessel  was required to plan the passage in accordance\
  \ with the IMO convention standards \nand guidelines16 (see Appendix 3) , but there\
  \ was no international or New Zealand requirement \nfor the port companies and their\
  \ pilots to follow the same  standards when developing their \nown generic passage\
  \ plans.  The Port Otago passage plan as presented on its website would \nnot meet\
  \ the IMO  standards  or other reputable guidelines available to mariners on voyage\
  \ \nplanning17.   \n4.3.5.  When the pilot joined the Molly  Manx  he and the master\
  \ discussed the vessel's characteristics \nand went through the Otago Harbour passage\
  \  plan.  \n4.3.6.  However, the vessel  had its own passage plan loaded into the\
  \ ECDIS, which differed from that \nof Port Otago.  Because the vessel 's plan was\
  \ the p lan loaded into the ECDIS, that is what the \nbridge team , excluding the\
  \ pilot, was using to monitor the vessel's progress.  Me anwhile , the \npilot was\
  \ navigating the vessel  to the Port Otago  passage plan, using visual reference\
  \ s as he \nhad been  trained to do .  The bridge team, which now included the pilot,\
  \ was not aligned in its \nthinking and did not share the same understanding  of\
  \ the plan.  This dynamic was going to \nmake effective BRM  difficult to achieve,\
  \ which is discussed in the following section.  \n4.3.7.  The New  Zealand Port\
  \ and Harbour Marine Safety Code  is a voluntary national standard .  The \nCode\
  \ recommends that , \"Up-to-date passage plans and guidance should be published,\
  \ and be \navailable to harbour users and the masters of visiting vessel s\" (see\
  \ Appendix 6).  \n                                                        \n16 Chapt\
  \ er V, Safety of Navigation, of the Annex to the International Convention for the\
  \ Safety of Life at Sea \nand Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning.\
  \  \n17 Other best -practice guidelines also contain valuable advice on bridge watchkeeping\
  \ in general and voyage \nplanning in particular. They include: the United Kingdom's\
  \ Maritime and Coastguard Agency's guidance on \nChapter V, Safety of Navigation,\
  \ of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ; the\
  \ \nNautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - A practical guide; and the International\
  \ Chamber of \nShipping's Bridge Procedures Guide.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -204\
  \ \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3.8.  One method of ensuring that an approved passage plan\
  \ is available on board would be for \nport companies or harbour authorities to\
  \ make available to vessel s properly constructed and \nvalidated passage plan s\
  \ that meet the  port-specific standards  and guidelines included in  \nChapter\
  \ V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to the International Convention for the\
  \ Safety of \nLife at Sea  (SOLAS) , and Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage\
  \ Planning .  Such a system \nwould assist in on-board passage planning and allow\
  \ a v essel to be better prepared when the \npilot boards .  This action would greatly\
  \ assist the smooth transition of the pilot into the bridge \nteam at a time of\
  \ typically high workload and little time before the pilotage begins.  \n4.3.9.\
  \  More vessel s are using ECDIS s as the primary means of navigation , and  this\
  \ will increase in \nthe future.  As it was  on board the Molly Manx , the passage\
  \ plan to the berth is usually loaded \ninto the vessel 's ECDIS.  Ideally, passage\
  \ plans generated by port companies should be to the \nsame IMO standard s that\
  \ vessel s are required to meet , and should be compatible for use in \nan ECDIS.\
  \   \n4.3.10.  Many vessel s transit more than one New Zealand port.  It would greatly\
  \ enhance safety if the \npassage plans were, as far as practicable, in a standard\
  \ format an d could be found at one \nsite.  Vessel s routed to several New Zealand\
  \ ports would be able to access from one place \nstandardised passage plans for\
  \ several ports, even before they depart ed from their previous \noverseas port\
  \ s. \n4.3.11.  Currently there can be issues with uploading standardised passage\
  \ plans into an ECDIS, \nbecause ECDIS manufacturers have proprietary systems that\
  \ require specific formats.  \nHowever,  that will shortly change.   The International\
  \ Hydrographic Organization  and the \nInternational Electrotechnical  Commission\
  \ standard for ECDIS s (IEC 61774 Edition 4, \nSeptember 2015) from August 2017\
  \ includes a route exchange format that will make  it easier \nfor data transfers.\
  \  In the future it will be possible to send passage plans to all vessels in the\
  \ \ncorrect form at to be uploaded direct ly into the ECDIS system , thereby reducing\
  \ the possibility \nof navigating officers making errors when loading them  into\
  \ ECDIS s.  However, this facility was \nnot available at the time of the accident\
  \ and therefore was not able to be us ed by  the bridge \nteam on this occasion.\
  \    \n4.3.12.  The Commission has made recommendations to Maritime New Zealand\
  \ to promote the use of \nstandard passage plans by all New Zealand harbour authorities.\
  \  \n4.4. Molly Manx  electronic chart display and information system  \nSafety\
  \ issue : The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required\
  \ by  the \nIMO and company standards when the grounding occurred.  \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ Molly Manx  was approved to use an ECDIS as a primary means of navigation and\
  \ as such \ndid not have to car ry or use paper charts for navigation.   \n4.4.2.\
  \  User -defined safety settings are an important safety function when using an\
  \ ECDIS.  A failure \nto enter the correct safety settings can allow a vessel to\
  \ enter unsafe waters without alerting \nthe operator.  To achieve  a safe passage\
  \ plan, users of ECDIS s must understand how to \ndetermine  accurately  the correct\
  \ value for a safety setting as detailed in Table 2  on \n<< page 1 >>\n 6.  \n\
  The Molly Manx 's passage plan included settings for the deep contour, safety contour\
  \ and \nsafety depth, shallow contour, cross -track limit and watch vector setting\
  \ s (look ahead).   \n4.4.3.  Some of the values of user -defined ECDIS safety settings\
  \ in use on board the Molly Manx  \ndiffered from the values stated in the vessel's\
  \ passage plan and from the usual defa ult \nsettings.   \n4.4.4.  The cross -track\
  \ distance to either side of the vessel was set at 0.25 nautical miles or 463 m\
  \ \nas per the passage plan.  However, the narrowest width of the Port Otago channel\
  \ was \napproximately 100 m.  The vessel  would therefore  have been  413 m outside\
  \ the channel \nbefore the cross -track distance alarm would activate.  At the position\
  \ of the grounding the \nvessel was approximately 75 m off track.  The settings\
  \ in the ECDIS were not appropriate for \nthe intended passage into Port Otago.\

  \ 4.4.5.  The watch vector or predictor was required to be set for two minutes according\
  \ to the passage \nplan.  At the time of the grounding the ECDIS display showed\
  \ that the vector was set at 10 \nminutes  rather than two minutes as  specified\
  \ in the vessel's passage plan .  In a winding \nchannel such as Otago Harbou r,\
  \ setting the watch vector to 10 minutes would very likely \ncause the head of the\
  \ vector to be constantly outside the safe navigable water within the \nchannel,\
  \ which mean s it would be in a constant state of alarm.  Apart from creating alarm\
  \ \nmanagement issue s for the officer of the watch ( OOW ), it was unable to alert\
  \ the bridge team \nto any safety hazards ahead.   \n4.4.6.  Accurate user -defined\
  \ settings are essential if an ECDIS is to provide the level of navigational \n\
  safety expected of it.  This accident shows how ine ffective it can become if the\
  \ settings that \nhave been entered are incorrect.  \n4.5. Bridge resource management\
  \   \nSafety issue: The standard of BRM  on board the Molly Manx  during the Otago\
  \ pilotage did not \nmeet good industry practice.  \nImplementation o f BRM o n\
  \ board   \n4.5.1.  Achieving a high standard of BRM during the pilotage to Port\
  \ Otago was going to be difficult \nbecause the fundamental requirement of all working\
  \ to the same passage plan had not been \nmet.  Nevertheless , effective BRM could\
  \ still have prevented the groundi ng, but it was \nessentially absent amongst the\
  \ bridge team.  \n4.5.2.  The OOW  and the helmsman were part of the bridge team,\
  \ but they were not included in the \nbriefing  between the master and the pilot\
  \ .  The absence of the OOW , the relieving OOW  and \nthe helmsman from the briefing\
  \ was  a missed opportunity to  ensure that everyone was \nsharing the same understanding\
  \ , and  reinforce d the need to engage in challenge and \nresponse  and ensure\
  \ that the pilot was incorporat ed into the bridge team.  \n4.5.3.  The navigable\
  \ channel through Otago Harbour to Dunedin is narrow .  For a vessel  the size of\
  \ \nthe Molly Manx  there are very few possible variations to the preferred  courses\
  \ .  Even if the \nOOW had been monitoring the progress of the vessel  against the\
  \ vessel 's passage plan with \nagreed off -track limits , the vessel 's deviation\
  \ to starboard of the track could and should have \nbeen noticed and raised with\
  \ the master and pilot.  However, the ECDIS had not been correctly \nconfigured\
  \ for the transit of the narrow channel, and the OOW had not been in vited to \n\
  challenge the master or pilot if the vessel  deviated from the intended route. \
  \ \n4.5.4.  As the vessel entered the Otago Harbou r pilotage the OOW was relieved.\
  \  The relieving OOW \nwas not briefed by the master on what was expected of him\
  \ or made aware of significant \ninformation from the master -pilot exchange of\
  \ information.  He was therefore not fully \nincorporated into the bridge team.\
  \  \n4.5.5.  Despite the pilot advising the master at the master/pilot exchange\
  \ that he welcomed being \nchallenge d by the bridge team , and explaining the contents\
  \ of the Port Otago Master/Pilot \nInformation Exchange sheet (see Appendix 1) ,\
  \ which includes the notation:  \nDespite the duties and obligations of a Pilot,\
  \ the Pilot's presence on board does \nnot relieve the Master o r Officer in char\
  \ ge of the navigation watch from their \nduties and obligations for the safety\
  \ of the vessel.  The Bridge Team have a duty \nto support the Pilot and to ensure\
  \ that his/her actions are monitored at all times . \nthe pilot said that after\
  \ the OOWs had changed he soon realised that he was working very \nmuch on his own\
  \ .  It was a situation that the pilot said he was familiar with .  As difficult\
  \ as it \nwill be to encourage a bridge team to engage  fully in the conduct of\
  \ a vessel  when it is not \ntheir normal culture to do so, a pilot should nevertheless\
  \ challenge the navigation team to do \nso, as should a navigation team do in a\
  \ reciprocal situation where a pilot lapses into a one -\nperson operation .  A\
  \ breakdown in BRM  can never be attributable to only one of the \nparticipants\
  \ . \nFinal Report MO -2016 -204 \n<< Page 18 >>\n 4.5.6.  The relieving OOW assumed\
  \  responsibility for : operating the  engine  telegraph ; monitoring the \nhelmsman\
  \  and ensuring the correct helm was applied ; checking the under -keel clearance\
  \ ; and \nchecking the vessel' s position on the ECDIS .  These were important tasks.\
  \  Both the master \nand the OOW noticed the vessel  deviating to starboard, but\
  \ neither spoke  up and alerted the \npilot to the vessel's position .  There was\
  \ silence on the bridge as the vessel  ran aground .     \n4.5.7.  The company 's\
  \ safety ma nagement system had comprehensive sections  on BRM and the \nrequirement\
  \  for passage planning from berth to berth (see Appendix 5) (as contained in \n\
  Chapter V, Safety of Navigation , of the Annex to SOLAS,  Regulation 34 Safe Navigation\
  \ and  \nResolution A.893(21) Guidelines for Voyage Planning ) (see Appendix 3 for\
  \ relevant parts).   \n4.5.8.  However, i ncluding a requirement to practi se good\
  \ BRM and planning the passage in a safety \nmanagement system  does not fulfil\
  \ a company 's and master's obligations in that regard .  \nPuttin g the concepts\
  \ into practice is the key.  Unless managers and masters  believe in, \npromote\
  \ , practi se and drive good BRM  skills , they are unlikely to  succeed . \n4.5.9.\
  \  The Commission would normall y make a recommendation to the F lag State administration\
  \ for  \nthe vessel to address through Flag S tate control any deficiencies in bridge\
  \ practices.  \nHowever, the vessel is now under different operation and has been\
  \ re -registered with a \ndifferent Flag State.  \nFindings  \n3. The pilot and\
  \ the vessel's  bridge team did not have a shared understanding of  \none common\
  \  passage plan to the berth before the pilotage began, which meant \nthey were\
  \ not all sharing the same understanding  of the plan . \n4. The vessel's ECDIS\
  \ was not correctly configured for navigation in a narrow \nchannel, whi ch meant\
  \ the crew were not adequately monitoring the progress of \nthe vessel  in support\
  \ of the pilot, who was navigating mainly by visual \nreference s. \n5. Neither\
  \ the master nor the officer of the watch speaking up when they both \nnoticed that\
  \ the vessel  was to s tarboard of the track according to their passage \nplan was\

  \ >>\n 5. Findings  \n5.1. The grounding occurred because the bridge team , including\
  \ the pilot , lost situational \nawareness and did not realise that the vessel \
  \ had deviated so far starboard of the intended \ntrack.   \n5.2. The bridge team\
  \ , including the pilot , did not realise how far the vessel  had deviated from\
  \ the \nintended track because they were not monitoring the vessel 's progress \
  \ effectively  and by all \navailable means.   \n5.3. The pilot and the vessel's\
  \ bridge team did not have a shared understanding of one common \npassage plan to\
  \ the berth before the pilotage began, which meant they were not all sharing \n\
  the same understanding of the plan.   \n5.4. The vessel's ECDIS was not correctly\
  \ configured for navigation in a narrow channel, which \nmeant the crew were not\
  \ adequately monitoring the progress of the vess el in support of the \npilot, who\
  \ was mainly navigating by visual references.  \n5.5. Neither the master nor the\
  \ officer of the watch speaking up when they both noticed that the \nvessel  was\
  \ to starboard of the track according to their passage plan was a lost opportun\
  \ ity to \navert the grounding . \n5.6. The standard of bridge resource management\
  \ on the Molly Manx  bridge leading up to the \ngrounding did not meet industry\
  \ good practice.   \n \n  \nFinal Report MO -2016 -204 \n<< Page 20 >>"
