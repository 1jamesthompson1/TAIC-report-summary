  \ an ongoing safety concern in the maritime industry because of their \npotential\
  \ to cause serious inj ury and loss of life.  Although  new initiatives from the\
  \ IMO have made \nsignificant inroads into addressing these safety concerns, launching\
  \ a lifeboat still remains a \nfundamentally high -risk operation.  \n4.1.2.  The\
  \ freefall lifeboat has been generally regarded as a safe m eans of abandoning a\
  \ ship.  It is \ndesigned to escape the vicinity of the ship without the need for\
  \ the traditional side -launching \napplianc es and the inherent risks associated\
  \ with them .  A freefall lifeboat simply  requires t he crew \nto secure themselves\
  \ on  board and activate a lever that diseng ages a release hook .  The lifeboat\
  \ \nthen slides down a ramp and falls into the water by gravity .  A free fall lifeboat\
  \ can also be lowered  \ninto the water  by a secondary means involving a crane\
  \ , a method that  is often utilised during  \ntraining drills as an alternative\
  \ to freefall launching .  Although this method allows the life boat to \nmeet the\
  \ testing requireme nts of SOLAS , it does reintroduce  some of the inherent risks\
  \ associated \nwith the traditional side -launching davit systems, such as being\
  \ susceptible to a single point failure.  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses\
  \ what caused the wire lifting sling to fail.  It also discusses a \nbroader safety\
  \ issue of manufacturers encasing wire ropes in plastic or similar material s, and\
  \ also \nthe importance of proper documentation for the design and testing of safety\
  \ -critical arrangements \nsuch as lifting sling s. \n4.2. Why the wire lifting\
  \ slings fail ed \n4.2.1.  The Defence Te chnology Agency conducted  metallurgical\
  \ and fractographic analyses of the \ndamaged components of the lifting sling shown\
  \ in Figure 5 . \n \nFigure 5  \nEight failed parts  of the four wire sling s \n\
  (photo courtesy of Maritime New Zealand)  \n4.2.2.  The full report on the failure\
  \ by the Defence Technology Agency can be seen in  Appendix 1 .  The \nreport concluded\
  \ that  all four wire components of  the lifting sling  had been significantly weakened\
  \ \nby severe corrosion . Salt water had penetrated  the plastic s heath that encased\
  \  the wire rope and \nwasted the galvanising on the steel wire, which then allowed\
  \ corrosion of the steel wire  itself .  The \n\n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report MO\
  \ -2014 -202 weakened wire ropes then failed by tensile overload  during the lifeboat\
  \ -recovery operation  (see \nFigure 6) .  \n \nFigure 6  \nSevere corrosion on\
  \ a failed wire sling  \n(photo courtesy of Defence Technology Agency)  \n4.2.3.\
  \  The wire rope, where it had been encased in the polymeric sheathing, was totally\
  \ devoid of any \nlubrication or other corrosion -inhibiting subst ances.  Grease\
  \ had been applied to the eyes of the \nwire rope where it was not encased in the\
  \ polymeric sheathing (see Figure 7 ). \n \nFigure 7  \n Parts of the wire slings\

  \ -2014 -202 \n<< Page 9 >>\n 4.2.4.  The lifeboat manufacturer supplied  the Commission\
  \ with a copy of the specification and test  \ncertificate for the wire that it\
  \ used for constructing the wire lifting sling (see Appendix 2).  The \ncertificate\
  \ stated that the wire rope was an 18 x 19 steel wire rope (18 str ands of 19 wires\
  \ each) \nwith a fibre rope core and a diameter of 20  millimetres .  However, the\
  \  failed wire slings were made \nfrom wire rope of  6 x 37 construction ( six strands\
  \ of 37 wires each) with fibre rope core and a \ndiameter of 18 to 18.5 millimetre\
  \ s (see Appendix 1 for details).  According to the vessel's owner, \nthe wire lifting\
  \ slings had not been replaced since the ship was new, although this could not be\
  \ \nverified from records on board the ship.  The specifications mentioned in the\
  \ product certificate  did \nnot match the wire sling that was fitted and used at\
  \ the time of the incident.  \n4.2.5.  As can be seen in Figure 3 , the angle at\
  \ which the lifeboat sat when being lifted require d the \ncomponents of the lifting\
  \ sling to be different lengths.  The vector of force s on the lifting sling when\
  \ \nsupporting the fully  loaded lifeboat meant that the forces were greater on\
  \ the longer components \nof the lifting sling.  Calculations and drawings provided\
  \ by the lifeboat manufacturer show ed that \nthe maximum load on the longer components\
  \ of the lifting sling was about 22.9  kilonewtons8 (refer \nto Appendix 3 for \
  \ the manufacturer's  calculations) .  The Defence T echnology Agency report said\
  \ \nthat a reduction of two millimetres  in wire rope diameter equate d to about\
  \ a 20% reduction in \nbreaking load.  The 20 -millimetre wire rope for which a\
  \ test certificate was supplied had an (as \ntested) breaking load of 232 kilonewtons\
  \ .  This meant that the smaller -diameter (18 to 18.5  \nmillimetres ) wire rope\
  \ would have had a breaking st rain of 185.6 kilonewtons , assuming the two \nwire\
  \ ropes were of the same or similar grade and quality of steel9. \n4.2.6.  The wire\
  \ that was used to manufacture the lifting sling therefore was still  about 25%\
  \ stronger than \nthat which  would have been needed to achieve  the factor  of\
  \ safety10 of six required by SOLAS.  \n4.2.7.  It is nevertheless a concern that\
  \ the wire stated by the lifeboat manufacturer as having been used \nto construct\
  \ the lifting sling was different from that actually used.  This is discussed further\
  \ in the \nfollowing sections.  \nFindings  \n1. All four wire pennants on the lifting\
  \ sling for the Da Dan Xia 's freefall  lifeboat \nparted under tensile overload\
  \ because they were significantly weakened by \nsevere corrosion.  \n2. The corrosion\
  \ was mainly caused by salt water penetratin g and accumulating \naround the steel\
  \ wire under a plastic sheathing that had been placed around \nthe wire pennants\
  \ when the lifting sling was manufactured.  The plastic \nsheathing also prevented\
  \ the crew applying anticorrosive compounds to the \nsteel wire.  \n3. The steel\
  \ wire making up the four pennants of the lifting sling had a  smaller \ndiameter\
  \ and was of a different construction from that which the manufacturer \nsaid had\
  \ been used during construction.  However, it would still have been of \nsufficient\
  \ strength (w hen new) to support the weight of the loaded lifeboat with \nthe requisite\
  \ factor of safety.  \n \n  \n                                                 \
  \       \n8 A kilonewton is a unit of force commonly used for structural calculations.\
  \  \n9 It was not possible to determine the grade of the strength or the quality\
  \ of the steel used to manufac ture the \nfailed samples.  \n10 A factor of safety\
  \ is a term describing the structural capacity of a system beyond the expected load\
  \ or actual \nload; essentially, how much stronger the system is than it usually\
  \ needs to be for an intended load . \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report MO -2014 -202\
  \ 4.3. Plastic (polymeric) coating of steel wires in the marine industry  \nSafety\
  \ issue - Encasing wire rope in plastic sheathing prevents the wire being lubricated,\
  \ maintained and \ninspected , and can accelerate the onset of corrosion through\
  \ the retention of salt water within the core of \nthe wire rope . \n4.3.1.  The\
  \ wire lifting sling  was manufactured by  the free fall lifeboat manufacturer,\
  \ Jiangyinshi Beihai LSA \nCo., Limited , China.   It had enclosed the wire rope\
  \ in a plastic sheathing.  The freefall  lifeboat and \nthe wire lifting sling \
  \ were then supplied by the lifeboat manufacturer to  the Haun ghai Shipbuilding\
  \ \nyard,  China , to be fitted on  board the Da Dan Xia .  This lifeboat manufacturer\
  \ has produced more \nthan 600 freefall lifeboats, all of which have been installed\
  \ with the same type of wire sling that \nparted during this accident.  \n4.3.2.\
  \  The wire slings  were secured on the exterior of the lifeboat canopy and were\
  \ exposed to the \nelements.   Seawater ingress would have taken place over time\
  \ through the ends of the plastic \nsheathing, and through any cracks or gaps that\
  \ develop ed in the plastic sheathing as it aged and \nwore .  Once salt water penetrated\
  \ the wire through the plastic sheathing, the sheathing would aid \nthe corrosion\
  \ process by retaining the salt water around the wire  (see Figure 8). \n4.3.3.\
  \  The plastic sheathing may also h ave aided in entrapping the sea water and accelerating\
  \ corrosion , \nultimately resulting in the weakening and failure of the slings\
  \ .  \n4.3.4.  The existing IMO regulations  for the periodi c testing of lifeboat\
  \ s require each launching appliance \nto be so constructed that all parts requiring\
  \ regular maintenance by the ship's crew are readily \naccessible and ea sily maintained.\
  \   \n4.3.5.  The non-transparent plastic sheathing on the  wire sling s concealed\
  \ the galvanised  steel wire rope , \nmaking it neither easily accessible nor maintainable\
  \  (see Figure 8).  This meant that the crew had \nno way of visually determi ning\
  \ whether the wire rope remained fit for the purpose of lowering  and \nrecovering\
  \ the free fall lifeboat , other than by removing the plastic sheathing.   Encasing\
  \ the wire \nrope in plastic served no purpose other than to protect the gelcoat11\
  \ of the glass -reinforced plastic \nof the lifeboat canopy, although the wire eyes,\
  \ thimbles and lifting rings would still h ave caused this \nproblem anyway.  Since\
  \ the incident the manufacturer has ceased the practice of enclosing wire \nropes\
  \ in plastic sheathing. Instructions have also been issued to all its service stations\
  \ to replace \nthe plastic -sheathed wire ropes on existing lifeboats.  \n4.3.6.\
  \  There  are other cases where a wire rope being encased in plastic sheathing has\
  \ been a factor \ncontributing to the  failure of the wire.  One such case was a\
  \ freefall lifeboat incident  discussed in a \nreport  released on 29 August 2013\
  \ by the maritime administrator for the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands.  In\
  \ this accident  a corroded  wire sling was used to secure a lifeboat while the\
  \ crew \nperformed maintenance operations on the lifeboat -securing  hook. The wire\
  \ sling subsequently \nparted , allowin g the boat and unprepa red crew members\
  \ to fall into the water. The investigation \ndetermined that the corrosion on the\
  \ wire sling encased in a plastic sheathing had not been \npreviously detected.\
  \ ( Refer to Appendix 4 for the full report .) \n4.3.7.  The Commission has recommended\
  \ that the Director of Maritime New Zealand make a submission \nto the IMO for the\
  \ relevant subcommittee to start the process of preventing the use of plastic \n\
  sheathing on steel wire that is likely to be exposed to the weather or is likely\
  \ to require ongoing \ninspection  and maintenance.  \n                        \
  \                                \n11 Gelcoat is a ma terial used to provide a high\
  \ -quality finish on the visible surface of a fibre -reinforced composite \nmaterial\
  \ . \n   \nFinal report MO -2014 -202 \n<< Page 11 >>\n  \nFigure 8  \n Wire rope\
  \ concealed within the plastic sheathing  \nFinding s \n4. The plastic sheathing\
  \ that had been placed around the wire on the lifting sling \nby the manufacturer\
  \ prevented the crew and surveyors inspectin g and \nmaintaining the lifting sling\
  \ to the standards required by the International \nMaritime Organi zation Convention\
  \ for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).  \n5. Totally e ncasing steel wire in plastic\
  \ sheathing when it is to be used in the \nmarine environment has significant implications\
  \ for maritime safety, especially \nwhen the wire must be regularly inspected and\
  \ maintained in order to remain fit \nfor purpose . \n4.4. Certification , inspection\
  \ and maintenance of the wire lifting sling  \n4.4.1.  Each lifting appliance on\
  \  board a ship is provided with a product certificate that details the design \n\
  specifications of the appliance. The IMO's International Life-Saving Appliance Code\
  \ requires a \nminimum factor of safety  of six to be applied to suspension chains,\
  \ link s, block s and falls12, \nincluding wire sling s.  For this purpose various\
  \ tests and inspections are condu cted before a lifting \nappliance is initially\
  \ certified by a competent authority.  This certificate must be kept on board and\
  \ \nmade  available for inspection.  \n4.4.2.  The manufacturer had calculated the\
  \ required load capacity for the lifting sling.  It had produced a \ntest certificate\
  \ and a drawing for it as well.  However, neither the test certificate nor the drawing\
  \ \nhad been supplied to the vessel .  At the time of the incident there was no\
  \ certificate  on board for \nthe wire sling s and none of the crew  was aware of\
  \ this . \n                                                        \n12 A fall is\
  \ a rope by which a boat is hoisted or lowered . \n\n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report\
  \ MO -2014 -202 4.4.3.  As a general rule the maintenance and inspection of safety\
  \ equipment  must be carried out in \naccordance with the manufacturers ' instructions\
  \ and safety pr ecautions . A poorly drafted \nmanufacturer's instruction manual\
  \ can compound the difficulties in maintaining and operating any \nequipment.  The\
  \ Da Dan Xia  had been  provided with a detailed instructio n manual by the \nmanufacture\
  \ r of the free fall lifeboat.  The manual covered six  main topics , of which t\
  \ he last two \nwere on  the maintenance procedures a nd schedules for the lifeboat\
  \ and its associated equipment.  \n4.4.4.  The secti on on maintenance procedures\
  \ had  nine subsections , including  a topic ti tled \"Lubrication s \nand gr easing\
  \ po ints. Anticorrosion maintenance \".  However , there was no mention o f any\
  \ specific \nmaintenance  plan or  recommended renewal period for th e wire sling\
  \ s.  Consequently the ship's \nplanned -maintenance program me did not address\
  \ this issue either.  The manufacturer has since \naddressed this safety issue (refer\
  \ to  the \"Safety actions\" section of this report) . \n4.4.5.  The safety management\
  \ systems on board the Da Dan Xia  had procedures in place to test and \nmaintain\
  \ the freef all lifeboat and its associated launching appliances.  They included\
  \ weekly visual \ninspections and monthly greasing routines for both the lifeboat\
  \ davit falls and the wire slings.  \nThere was evidence that the crew had greased\
  \ the exposed areas of the wire slings around the \nthimble and ferrule , but not\
  \ the areas concealed within the plastic sheathing. Despite their inability \nto\
  \ inspect a large portion of the sling s visually , the crew continued using the\
  \ wire slings assuming \nthey were still fit for purpose.  \n4.4.6.  Notwithstanding\
  \ the absence of guidance from the lifeboat manufacturer on the inspection, \nmaintenance\
  \ and replacement of the lifting sling, it was clearly an item that needed maintaining\
  \ \nand inspecting in accordance with best international standard s of seam anship.\
  \   \n4.4.7.  The lifeboat and its appliances had been inspected and serviced annually\
  \ by a specialist service \nprovider approved by the manufacturer.  Inspecting the\
  \ condition of the wires for damage such as \ncorrosion was part of the service.\
  \  However , the spec ialist service provider raised no concern s \nregarding the\
  \ plastic sheathing, which would have been preventing his properly inspecting the\
  \ \nwires making up the lifting sling.  \nFinding s \n6. The manufacturer of the\
  \ lifeboat did not provide adequate advice on the \narrangement and construction\
  \  of, or the maintenance and replacement \nrequirements  for, the lifeboat lifting\
  \ sling.  \n7. Neither the ship 's planned -maintenance system nor the surveyors\
  \ of the \nlifeboat -launching system appear to have recognised the safety -critical\
  \  function \nof the lifting sling, and the fact that it could not be properly inspected\
  \ and \nmaintained in accordance with the relevant SOLAS requirements . \n \n  \n\
  \   \nFinal report MO -2014 -202 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.5. Mitigating the risk of lifeboat\
  \ drills  \n4.5.1.  Launching and retrieving a lifeboat are high-risk activities,\
  \  but with proper training a ship's \npersonnel can attain the required level of\
  \ familiarity to identify and overcome  the potential risks.   \nThe crew of the\
  \ Da Dan Xia  were  aware of the lifeboat -launching and -recovery procedures ,\
  \ \nincluding the need to secure themselves in their seats once on  board the lifeboat.\
  \  \n4.5.2.  In this incident the third officer  released his safety harness before\
  \ the lifeboat was secured to its \ncradle.  Once the wire ropes parted , the third\
  \ officer, now unrestrained, was thrown to the forward \nend of the lifeboat and\
  \ suffered a head injury.   \n4.5.3.  The c ommander of a lifeboat is responsible\
  \ for all operations connected with the lifeboat and the \nsafety of the lifeboat\
  \ crew on  board.  It is important that he ensure  that all crew members remain\
  \ \nseated with their restraints  securely fastened at all times.  \n4.5.4.  Some\
  \ consideration was given to the risk of retrieving the lifeboat with the minimum\
  \ crew still on \nboard.  This risk would  have  been offset by the risk of removing\
  \ the crew from the waterborne \nlifeboat by rope ladder.  \n4.5.5.  The IMO published\
  \ guidance to consider when conducting drills using lifeboats lowered by falls \n\
  (Measures to Prevent Accidents with Lifeboats,  MSC.1/Circ.1206/Rev.1).  The circula\
  \ r \nrecommended that before performing drills with persons in a lifeboat the boat\
  \ be first lowered and \nrecovered without persons on board, and that when  the\
  \ actual drill was performed  the boat be \nlowered into the water with only the\
  \ number of persons on boar d necessary to operate the boat.  \n4.5.6.  In this\
  \ case the master did order the boat to be lowered to the water with no crew on\
  \ board, which \nhad the effect of testing the functioning of the lifeboat -launching\
  \ syste m.  Rather than retrieve the \nboat again to place th e crew on board, they\
  \ boarded by ladder.  He had in effect tested the proper \nfunctioning of the launching\
  \ and retrieval system.  \n4.5.7.  As it happened, the lifting sling failed with\
  \ the boat at a lesser height than it normally would have , \nhad it been launching\
  \ in  the freefall  mode.  The issue  was not so much the decision to leave the\
  \ \ncrew on board during the retrieval process, but the fact that the third officer\
  \ removed his restraints  \nbefore the boat had been secured in its cradle, thereby\
  \ causing him to be injured.  The master's \ndecision to retrieve the lifeboat with\
  \ the minimum boat crew on board was reasonable.  \nFinding  \n8. The third mate\
  \ was injured when the lifeboat fell to the sea because he had \nprematurely released\
  \ his restraints  before the lifeboat was securely locked into \nits stowed position\
  \ ; otherwise , the manner in which the lifeboat drill was \nconducted was reasonable\
