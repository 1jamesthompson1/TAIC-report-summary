- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The investigation did not provide direct evidence of human error or assumptions contributing to the accident. However, the inability to determine the exact cause for the hook-and-loop fastener tabs becoming undone ("The reason for the hook-and-loop fastener tabs becoming undone could not be determined" (4.3)) suggests a possibility of human error in the installation or inspection process. This percentage is kept low due to the lack of concrete evidence in the document.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There is no direct mention of a lack of training and competency contributing to the accident. However, the document does highlight the importance of proper training and familiarity with equipment, which indirectly suggests that training and competency are always underlying factors in safe operations ("the availability of information about safe working practices, developed by subject-matter experts such as bucket manufacturers and technical specialists in the field, assists operators to make well-informed decisions and establish good procedures" (3.30 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that the pilot had previously experienced instability with the same bucket when it became aerodynamically unstable ("The operator's manager of operations recalled an earlier incident involving the same bucket used on the accident flight" (3.14)). This suggests that familiarity with the equipment's behavior in different conditions is crucial, and the lack of it may have contributed to the accident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document that suggests Crew Resource Management was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document indicates that the manufacturer had not promulgated key operational information on and limitations of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket to operators ("The manufacturer of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket had not promulgated key operational information on and limitations of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket to operators" (3.28)). This lack of information dissemination could have led to a lack of adherence to safety procedures that might have prevented the accident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document mentions an earlier incident with the same bucket that was not reported through the operator's internal quality and safety management system ("The operator had not reported their earlier incident with this same bucket" (3.46)). This indicates a potential issue with the safety culture within the organization, which could have contributed to the accident by not sharing learnings that could have prevented a recurrence.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document highlights that the investigation focused on the aerodynamic stability of the bucket, which likely resulted in the contact with the tail rotor ("Therefore, the investigation focused on the aerodynamic stability of the bucket, which likely resulted in the contact with the tail rotor" (3.12)). This points to a lack of risk management and analysis regarding the bucket's design and its interaction with the helicopter during operations.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document states that there was no requirement for a manufacturer to promulgate any operational information or limitations, and IMS had not done so ("As the aviation regulatory framework did not cover this type of external load equipment, there was no requirement for a manufacturer to promulgate any operational information or limitations" (3.32)). This suggests a gap in regulatory oversight and compliance that may have contributed to the accident.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not provide specific evidence that situational awareness was a direct factor in the accident. However, the pilot's observation of the bucket "looking soft" and not filling correctly could indicate a momentary lapse in situational awareness or a misinterpretation of the bucket's condition ("The pilot stated that while dipping the bucket normally into the dipping pond immediately before the accident the bucket 'looked soft' and did not fill correctly" (3.4)).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document that suggests Emergency Response Preparedness was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document mentions that the hook-and-loop fastener tabs had been displaced and the tubular, segmented, stainless-steel ring was no longer in place, which could indicate a maintenance or inspection issue ("The initial examination of the bucket found that a number of the hook-and-loop fastener tabs had been displaced" (3.18)). This suggests that maintenance and inspection regimes may have been a contributing factor.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document that suggests the Use of Automation was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document indicates that weather conditions were not a contributing factor to the accident ("The environmental conditions at the time of the accident were reported as good" (3.9)).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document that suggests Communication Breakdown was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document that suggests Fatigue Management was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The "Other" category is assigned to the specific design issues with the Cloudburst monsoon bucket, which had a hook-and-loop fastener system that had the potential to come undone during operations ("The monsoon bucket had a hook-and-loop fastener system that had the potential to come undone during operations" (4.5)). This design issue is not covered by the predefined safety themes but was a significant contributing factor to the accident.
