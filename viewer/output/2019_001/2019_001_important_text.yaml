  \ being flown with an empty monsoon bucket suspended below \nit, the lifting line\
  \ struck the helicopter's tail rotor . \n3.2. Helicopter external load operations\
  \ involve hazards  additional to  normal  helicopter \nflight . Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ are in place to minimise these risks by restricting such \noperations ; however\
  \ , operators  are required to identify risks specific to their own \noperation\
  \ s and mitigate these as m uch as reasonably practicable. The availability of \n\
  accurate and relevant information assists operators to make well  informed decisions\
  \ and \nestablish appropriate procedures.  \n3.3. The following section analyses\
  \ the circumstances surrounding the event to identify those \nfactors that increased\
  \ the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the severity of its \noutcome.\
  \ It also examines any safety issues that have the potential to adversely affect\
  \ \nfuture operations.  \nWhat happened  \n3.4. The pilot stated  that while dipping\
  \ the bucket normally into the dip ping pond \nimmediately before the accident the\
  \ bucket \"looked soft\" and did not fill correctly . A \nsecond attempt was made\
  \ to lower the bucket into the water, after which,  the pilot \nobserved , a weight\
  \ of 800 kg displayed on the load cell17. This confirmed to the pilot that \nthe\
  \ bucket was filled sufficiently . The pilot recalled the shape of the bucket looking\
  \ \nnormal  and then continuing with the flight as intended.  \n3.5. The pilot flew\
  \ to the target area with no noticeable problems, then  dropp ed the load of \n\
  water on the target area as planned. A climbing turn was commenced t owards the\
  \ \ndipping pond with the empty bucket.   \n3.6. During this flight back to the\
  \ dipping pond , the synthetic lifting line for the bucket \ncontacted the tail\
  \ rotor , resulting  in the failure of the tail rotor and the drive shaft. This\
  \ \nwas evidence d by: \n\uF0B7 fire service personnel  and anoth er helicopter\
  \ pilot stating that they saw  the monsoon \nbucket in close proximity to the tail\
  \ rotor , followed by the helicopter turning to the \nleft \n\uF0B7 the pilot's\
  \ recollection of the accident sequence  \n\uF0B7 damage  to the tail rotor assembly\
  \ and the nature of the failure of the tail rotor drive \nshaft  \n\uF0B7 the chemical\
  \ analysis of the material transferred onto the tail rotor assembly , which  \n\
  confirmed that it was the sam e as the lifting line sheathing.  \n3.7. With the\
  \ tail rotor disabled, the pilot was not able to maintain directional control of\
  \ the \nhelicopter and had to descend  into the forested area below  to conduct\
  \ a forced landing . \n                                                        \n\
  \ \n17 The load cell presented a real -time weight of the load on the cargo hook\
  \ to the pilot via a digital \ncockpit display.  \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2019 -001 Why it happened  \n3.8. A number of factors that co uld have caused\
  \ the contact between the lifting line and the \ntail rotor were considered, including\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 environmental  conditions /turbulence  \n\uF0B7 the flight regime ,\
  \ i.e. control inputs /airspeed  \n\uF0B7 mechanical  failure  \n\uF0B7 the bucket\
  \ 's aerodynamic stability . \n3.9. The environmental  conditions at the time  of\
  \ the accident  were reported as good , with \nnearby weather stations recording\
  \ about 15 knots of wind.  \n3.10. A BK117 helicopte r18 was operating in the same\
  \ circuit pattern as the accident helicopter. \nThe pilot of that helicopter and\
  \ the ac cident pilot had both completed numerous water \ndrops within the circuit\
  \ and had not experienced any adverse wind conditions or \nsignificant turbulence.\
  \   \n3.11. At the start of the accident sequence, the GPS recorded a ground speed\
  \ of about 70 \nknots. The GPS data also showed a consistent and predictable flight\
  \ path throughout the \n40-minute  flight, with the ground speed under  80 knots.\
  \  No unpredictable flight \ncharacteristics  from the bucket were reported  when\
  \ f lown at  70 knots air speed.   \n3.12. The environment al conditions  that existed\
  \  at the time of the accident , excessive control \ninputs , excessive speed  and\
  \ any technical /mechanical issues with the helicopter  were all \neliminated as\
  \ possible contributing factors by the evidence . Therefore, the investigation \n\
  focused  on the aerodynamic stability of the bucket , which likely result ed in\
  \ the contact \nwith the tail rotor . \nThe monso on bucket 's aerodynamic stability\
  \  \nSafety issue: the initial design of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket meant the\
  \ hook -and-loop \nfastener system had the potential to come undone during operations\
  \  \n3.13. As the size , shape  and weight of underslung  loads vary significantly,\
  \ so does the \npotential for a load to become aerodynamically unstable. The airspeed\
  \ of the helicopter  \nalso affects the amount of aerodynamic force generated by\
  \ the load . A higher airspeed \nwill result in larger forces, and a lower airspeed\
  \ will result in lower forces. The \nCommission  was made aware of previous occurrences\
  \ of this type of bucket becoming \nunstable in  flight and examined  these occurrences\
  \ to establish if any similarities existed.  \nPrevious occurrences  \n3.14. The\
  \ operator's manager  of operations  recalled an earlier incident involving  the\
  \ same \nbucket used on the accident flight , when they were gaining their initial\
  \ experience with  it. \nIn that earlier incident the bucket had becom e aerodynamically\
  \ unstable as the \nhelicopter gained airspeed , and the bucket  had \"started to\
  \  sail\". The pilot had landed \nand found that the bucket's top ring had not been\
  \  installed correctly. After  reinstal ling \nthe top ring , the pilot had been\
  \ able to continue without further incident.  \n                               \
  \                         \n \n18 The BK117 was a light twin -engine helicopter\
  \ .  \n \n \nFinal Report AO -2019 -001 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 3.15. The Commission received\
  \ reports from other operators that used this version of the \nCloudburst monsoon\
  \ bucket. One pilot reported being unable  to fill the bucket correctly \nwhen dipping\
  \ into the sea. That pilot noted  that two of the hook -and-loop fastener tabs \n\
  had opened. While the ring had remained in place, the fabric of the bucket had no\
  \ \nlonger been able to maintain its circular shape. Th e pilot had dumped all remaining\
  \ \nwater from the bucket and returned to the staging area. Th e pilot reported\
  \ that the \nbucket had been  \"misbehaving \" and it could not be flown fast. The\
  \ short flight back to \nthe staging area had been  conducted just above translational\
  \ speed19. \n3.16. A pilot of a third ope rator also described the bucket not flying\
  \ correctly due to hook -\nand-loop fastener tabs opening on at least two occasions.\
  \  \n3.17. Similarities existed between  the other pilots ' observation s and the\
  \ accident  pilot's  \ndescription of the bucket \"looking soft\" while filling.\
  \ Therefore, the investigation sought \nto understand the bucket's hook -and-loop\
  \ fastener system.  \nHook -and-loop fastener  \n3.18. The jettisoned bucket was\
  \ recovered from a forested area  at a location approximately \n100 m from where\
  \ the helicopter came to res t. The initial examination  of the bucket  \nfound\
  \  that a number of the hook -and-loop fastener tabs had been displaced, the  \n\
  tubular, segmented, stainless -steel ring was no longer in place,  and the top of\
  \ the bucket \nhad collapsed  (Figure 1 2).  \n3.19. The top section of the lifting\
  \ line was suspended in a tree and it appeared to have struck \ntree branches as\
  \ it fell . One of the hook -and-loop fastener tabs appeared worn when \ncompared\
  \ to the other tabs . This particular tab was located below the weighted ed ge,\
  \ \nwhich was at the front of the bucket in normal flight.  \n3.20. A post-accident\
  \  examination  conducted by the Commission with the assistance of the \nmanufacturer\
  \ determined that  while one of the hook -and-loop fasteners appeared worn , \n\
  it was capable of supporting  the forces expected when filled with water . However,\
  \ this \ndid not consider the additional aerodynamic  loads experienced by the buck\
  \ et in flight.  \n3.21. Videos of various Cloudburst buckets in  flight were reviewed.\
  \ It could be seen that w hen \nflown empty with the stainless -steel ring secure\
  \ and in place, the forward surface of the \nbucket exposed to the airflow was deflected\
  \ inward by the pressure of the air impinging \non the front of the bucket, but\
  \ it remained stable in flight.  \n3.22. The combined effects of the fabric de flecting\
  \ in flight and the flexing of the weighted \nedge when dipping could have resulte\
  \ d in forces pulling in opposing directions on the \nhook -and-loop fastener tabs\
  \ at the front of the bucket. This action , combined with the \ncompromised integrity\
  \ of the wor n hook -and-loop fastener tab, may have  resulted in the \nforward\
  \ tabs coming undone  and the stainless -steel ring becoming dislodged .  \n3.23.\
  \ Due to the lack of clear evidence to explain the displaced hook -and-loop fastener,\
  \ the \nCommission was unable to determine whether the displaced hook -and-loop\
  \ fasteners \nwere due to incorrect installation, worn material and flight loads,\
  \ abnormal forces duri ng \n                                                   \
  \     \n \n19 An airspeed after which a helicopter 's rotor system generates additional\
  \ lift for a giv en power setting. \nThe exact speed is variable depend ent on helicopter\
  \ type and environmental conditions, but ranges \nfrom about 16 to 24 knots.  \n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO -2019 -001 firefighting activities such as\
  \ striking a submerged object during dipping, or a \ncombination of these.  \n3.24.\
  \ While the Commission was unable to determine what initiated the displacement of\
  \ the \nhook -and-loop fastener, its displacement likely resulted in the stainless\
  \ -steel ring \nbecoming dislodged, which allowed the soft fabric of the empty bucket\
  \ to collapse and  \nchange the shape of the front and top of the bucket. The airflow\
  \ from forward flight \nacting on the misshapen and collapsed bucket resulted in\
  \ the bucke t becoming \naerodynamically unstable and flying significantly higher\
  \ and closer to the helicopter.  \nBucket design evolution  \n3.25. Since  the Cloudburst\
  \ monsoon bucket's  initial design, a number of improvements have \nbeen incorporated\
  \ into the bucket's various compon ents. The early design of the hook -\nand-loop\
  \ fastener tabs to retain the tubular, segmented, stainless -steel ring was \nsuperseded.\
  \ The new design was for the ring to be made out of a rigid composite \nmaterial,\
  \ in two sections, and for it to be permanently bol ted into the bucket.  \n3.26.\
  \ IMS advised that the change in design of the top ring enabled the bucket to be\
  \ more \nrapidly deployed on  site, and the design was not changed because of any\
  \ safety \nconcerns. IMS advised the Commission that some operators of the earlier\
  \ -design ed \nbucket had been told that, if they had concerns, they or IMS could\
  \ carry out a \nmodification to install the top  ring in the bucket permanently\
  \ by stitching the hook -and-\nloop fastener tabs together.  \n3.27. Monsoon buckets\
  \ used for firefighting operations are inherently exposed to harsh \noperating conditions,\
  \ where submerged objects or waves may impart forces on the \nhook -and-loop fasteners.\
  \ This creates the potential for hook -and-loop fasteners to come \nundone during\
  \ operations, as evidenced by the previous occurrences and this accident. \nTherefore,\
  \ the Commission has made a recommendation to the manufacturer that all \nCloudburst\
  \ monsoon buckets be fitted with the new design.  \n3.28. IMS advised the Commission\
  \ that it had produced 128 buckets with the earlier tubular, \nsegmented, stainless\
  \ -steel ring. Of these , 33 had been  sold in New Zealand. As this \nequipment\
  \ had not been  controlled  or tracked after the initial sale, the status of these\
  \ \nearlier buckets  could not be deter mined . \nOperational procedures  \nSafety\
  \ issue:  The manufacturer of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket had not promulgated\
  \ key \noperational information  on and limitations of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket\
  \ to operators.  \n \nSafety issue: There was insufficient guidance  to pilots on\
  \ the appropriate line length  for monsoon \nbucket operations . \n3.29. External\
  \ loads carried by helicopters have the potential to become unstable in flight.\
  \ This \nis a risk that operators normally manage by developing standard operating\
  \ procedures \napplic able to each role.  \n3.30. The availability of information\
  \ about safe working practices , developed by subject -matter \nexperts such as\
  \ bucket manufacturers and technical specialists in the field, assists \noperators\
  \ to make well  informed decisions and establish good procedures. When the \nrelevant\
  \ guidance is not available, operators may revert instead to personal knowledge\
  \ \nand experience to formulate their procedures.  \n \n \nFinal Report AO -2019\
  \ -001 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 3.31. IMS had developed recommended limitations regarding\
  \ airspeed, line length, and empty \nbucket flight co nfiguration for the Cloudburst\
  \ monsoon bucket and had also published \nan 'Operation Manual '. This manual provided\
  \ descriptions of the bucket 's components, \nbut contained no information relating\
  \ to the aforementioned limitations.  \n3.32. As the aviation regulatory framework\
  \ did not cover this type of external load equipment , \nthere was no requirement\
  \ for a manufacture r to promulgate  any operational information  \nor limitations\
  \ , and IMS had not done so . By comparison, the Commission found that a \nCanadian\
  \ manufacturer of  a similar product, known as  a 'Bambi Bucket ', had produce d\
  \ \ndetailed o peration al and service manuals that were accessible to operators\
  \  (see \nAppendices 1 and 2 for relevant extract from the O peration s Manual)\
  \ . \n3.33. When conducting external load operations, a pilot has to decide on the\
  \ length of the \nlifting line for the underslung load. The use of a longer lifting\
  \ line between the helicopter \nand the underslung load being carried increases\
  \ the distance that the undersl ung load \nneeds to move upwards before the lifting\
  \ line contacts any part of the helicopter. This \nreduces the likelihood of such\
  \ contact occurring and increases the time that the pilot has \nto respond. A shorter\
  \ line tends to increase  the accuracy and effici ency of the operation.  \n3.34.\
  \ Section 3 of the Bambi Bucket Operation s Manual described a procedure for checking\
  \ \ntail rotor clearance when using a line length of less than 15 m . The full procedure\
  \ is \nincluded in Appendix 1 of this report. It is summarised below : \n\uF0B7\
  \ measure the distance from the cargo hook to the closest point of the helicopter\
  \ tail \nrotor  \n\uF0B7 determine the bucket overall length - including the suspension\
  \ cables, from the \nshackle on the head  to the lowest point of the bucket   \n\
  \uF0B7 the tail rotor clearance must be a minimum of 0.15 m. \n3.35. In June 2019\
  \ Airbus  Helicopters  issued S afety Information Notice  No. 3349 -S-25 - \n'Follow\
  \ -up of recommendations and limitations associated with the use of bucket -type\
  \ \nfire-fighting systems ' (see Appendix 3 ). This notice  defined the importance\
  \ of following \nmanufacture rs' recommendations, reiterated the proced ure contained\
  \ in the Bambi \nBucket Operations Manual  and expanded its sc ope to cover all\
  \ bucket -type suspended \nsystems used for firefighting.   \n3.36. In summary,\
  \ this procedure recommended using either a short lifting line configuration \n\
  that ensured no part of the bucket could ever be closer tha n 0.15 m  from the tail\
  \ rotor, \nor a long lifting line of no less than 15 m in  length.  \n3.37. The\
  \ Commission found that s ome jurisdictions  defined  specific  operational  and\
  \ \nequipment  requirements  for the procurement of helicopter firefighting operations\
  \ . In the \nUnited State s for example , the National Wildfire Coordinating Group20\
  \ Standards for \nHelicopter Operations  required lifting lines to be  50 feet \
  \ (15.2 m) or longer .  \n                                                     \
  \   \n \n20 The National Wildfire Coordinating Group established standards defining\
  \ how helicopter operations \nwere to be conducted under the exclusive direction\
  \ and operational control of federal, state and local \nagencies.  \n \n\n<< Page\
  \ 20 >>\n Final Report AO -2019 -001 3.38. The FENZ standard  in place at the time\
  \ of the accident  did not have a  requirement  for \nlifting line length  at the\
  \ time  of the accident . The only reference to lifting line length was \nthat \"\
  Strop length shall be optimised with the type of bucket to counter rotor wash on\
  \ \nthe fire\"21.  \n3.39. The lifting line used on the accident flight was 8.5\
  \ m  in length . The Com mission \nidentified  that three additional  accidents\
  \ had occurred , in New Zealand, Italy and France \nrespectively, involving fire\
  \ buckets contacting the tail rotor s of AS350 helicopters22. All \nfour of these\
  \ helicopters  were conf igured with lifting line length s placing the  bucket s\
  \ \nwithin  the recommended  'no-go' zone as defined by the Bambi  Bucket Operations\
  \  \nManual  and the Airbus Safety Information Notice.   \n3.40. There have been\
  \ no recorded accidents involving a fire bucket contacting the tail rotor of \n\
  a helicopter when configured with the recommended length of lifting line.  \n3.41.\
  \ The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the recommended limitations for\
  \ tail \nrotor clearance , such as described in the Bambi Bucket Operations  Manual\
  \  and the \nAirbus Safety Information Not ice, should be appl ied to all monsoon\
  \ buckets .  \n3.42. At the time of the accident the operator's procedures did not\
  \ specify the appropriate line \nlength  for monsoon bucket operations . It is noted\
  \ , however , that the Airbus  Safety \nInformation Notice was not published un\
  \ til after the accident . The operator has since \nincorporated the Airbus guidance\
  \ into its operating procedures  and FENZ has included a \nsimilar requirement in\
  \ its updated  supplement for wildfire operations . \nOther c onsiderations  \n\
  Comparison with  previous accident ( Commission  inquiry  AO-2017 -001) \n3.43.\
  \ In another similar  accident, which occurred in N ew Zealand  in 2017 and was\
  \ the subject \nof a Commission inquiry  (AO-2017 -001), there were common factors\
  \ involved with \nlifting-line length.  \n3.44. The similarities between the two\
  \ accidents were: a) each involved a Cloudburst bucket \nwhere the rigging contacted\
  \ the tail rotor of an AS350 helicopter ; and b) each bucket \nwas equipped with\
  \ a lifting line of a length that increased the likelihood of that contact \nhappening.\
  \ However, the likely initiating cause of the contact between the tail rotor and\
  \ \nthe bucket rigging differed between the two accidents.  \n3.45. The helicopter\
  \ involve d in the earlier accident in New Zealand had been  equipped with a \n\
  camera, which had recorded video of the bucket throughout the flight. This video\
  \ \nevidence did not reveal any evidence of anomalies with the Cloudburst bucket\
  \ 's tubular \nsegmented steel  top ri ng, or its hook -and-loop fastener retaining\
  \ system.  \n                                                        \n \n21 Fire\

  Final Report AO -2019 -001 \n<< Page 21 >>\n Notification of occurrences and reporting\
  \  \n3.46. The operator had not reported their earlier incident with this same bucket\
  \ (see 3.14) \nthrough their internal quality and safety management system. As a\
  \ result, t hat incident \nhad not been advised to the CAA or used internally to\
  \ promote awareness or improve \noperational procedures.  \n3.47. The operations\
  \ manager  advised that since the earlier occurrence the operator's safety \nmanagement\
  \ system had evolved and that such an occurrence would now be captured \nand actioned\
  \ appropriately.  \n3.48. During a separate  Commission inquiry  into an accident\
  \ involving a different operator23, \nthe Commission had determined that an occurrence\
  \ that related to the likely cause of \nthat accident had not been  notified either\
  \ internally in the operator 's systems or through \nthe CAA reporting system .\
  \ That omission  had also resulted  in a lost opportunity to share \nexperiences\
  \ and learnings and potentially prevent a reoccurrence.   \n3.49. While Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules  Part 12 - Accidents, Incidents, and Statistics  defined the \nrequirements\
  \ to notify the CAA of accidents and certain incidents, the  reporting of all \n\
  occurrences through an operator's internal safety management system should be \n\
  encouraged.  \n3.50. On 6 April 2020 IMS issued on its website a Service Information\
  \ Letter24 detailing a pre -\nflight checklist for the Cloudburst bucket with the\

  \ \n3.51. The Service Information Letter  followed an email sent to a mailing list\
  \ from IMS on 7 \nFebruary 202 0, which included a Cloudburst Fire Bucket Safety\
  \ Notice. This notice \nexplained that IMS had discovered worn Velcro retention\
  \ tabs  during maintenance and \ntherefore wished to highlight the importance of\
  \ equipment checks and maintenance to \noperators of the buckets.  \n3.52. On 19\
