","0.0","10.0","While situational awareness is not directly cited as a contributing factor, the pilot's perception and understanding of the bucket's condition, specifically the observation that the bucket ""looked soft"" (3.4), could be related to situational awareness. However, the primary cause of the accident was related to equipment issues rather than the pilot's situational awareness.
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document to suggest that the pilot was distracted during the operation. The accident was not attributed to any distractions.
","0.0","5.0","Human error is indirectly mentioned as the operator had not reported an earlier incident with the same bucket through their internal quality and safety management system (3.46). This omission could be considered a human error in the organization's safety practices, but it was not the direct cause of the accident.
","0.0","15.0","The document indicates that the operator's procedures did not specify the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations (3.42), and there was a previous incident with the same bucket that was not reported (3.46). These organizational oversights suggest that safety culture and organizational influences played a role in the accident.
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication that communication breakdowns or crew resource management issues contributed to the accident. The document does not provide evidence of communication failures.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not discuss the pilot's training or preparedness for emergency procedures as a factor in the accident.
","0.0","0.0","Emergency response planning and coordination are not mentioned as factors in the accident. The focus of the document is on the causes leading up to the accident rather than the response to it.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of maintenance procedures and compliance issues contributing to the accident. The focus is on the design and operational use of the equipment.
","0.0","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems are not relevant to the cause of this accident, as there was no fire event that contributed to the occurrence.
","0.0","13.333","The document indicates that there was insufficient guidance available to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations (3.8), and the manufacturer had not promulgated key operational information on the limitations of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket to operators (3.30). This suggests that regulatory compliance and safety management were factors in the accident.
","5.774","36.667","The primary cause of the accident was related to the design of the monsoon bucket, specifically the hook-and-loop fastener system that had the potential to come undone during operations (3.25, 3.27). The investigation focused on the aerodynamic stability of the bucket, which likely resulted in contact with the tail rotor (3.12, 3.13).
","5.774","13.333","The document highlights that operators are required to identify risks specific to their own operations and mitigate these as much as reasonably practicable (3.2). The lack of action following a previous incident with the same bucket (3.46) and the absence of specific operational procedures (3.42) indicate shortcomings in risk assessment and management.
","5.774","0.0","Weather conditions were reported as good at the time of the accident (3.9), and weather was not identified as a contributing factor.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not suggest that structural integrity or material fatigue of the helicopter itself was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","6.667","""Other"" refers to the specific design evolution of the monsoon bucket and the manufacturer's subsequent improvements, which were not mandatory at the time of the accident (3.25, 3.27). This theme encompasses the specific equipment design issues that were not covered by the predefined safety themes but were critical to the accident's occurrence.","5.774","true","N/A"
