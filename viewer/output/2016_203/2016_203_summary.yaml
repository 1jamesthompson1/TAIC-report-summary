- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 35
  explanation: The accident was significantly influenced by the failure to adhere to safety procedures. The crew, including the deck cadet, did not wear safety harnesses despite the operator's safety management system requiring their use when working near the edge of a log stack on deck (4.3.1-4.3.3, 4.4.1-4.4.3). The chief officer did not enforce the use of safety harnesses, and the deck officers did not set an example by wearing them (4.4.2). This lack of adherence to safety procedures was a direct contributor to the severity of the accident, as wearing a safety harness connected to a fall arrestor would have saved the deck cadet's life (4.5.7).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The organizational safety culture on board Mount Hikurangi was poor, as evidenced by the routine non-use of safety harnesses and the acceptance of this risk by the crew (4.5.1). The safety culture did not prioritize safety, and there was no evidence of the crew questioning or halting unsafe practices (4.5.1). The internal audit findings prior to the accident indicated a poorly developed safety culture, and recommendations to improve safety were signed off as completed without actual change (4.5.5-4.5.6). This culture contributed to the accident by allowing unsafe practices to become normalized.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The deck cadet had participated in log-lashing operations on four other occasions, which suggests some level of training and competency (4.1.2). However, the expectation for the cadet to be mentored and taught safe working practices was not met, as evidenced by the cadet working at height without fall-prevention equipment (4.4.4). The crew's belief that there was little risk associated with falling from the log cargo while working close to the ship side indicates a lack of proper safety training and risk perception (4.4.4).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Risk management and analysis were not effectively implemented, as the risk assessment document on board did not specifically mention working from height in relation to log-lashing operations (4.3.6). Additionally, a 3W dynamic risk assessment was not carried out prior to the task, which could have identified the need for fall-prevention equipment (4.5.4). The lack of specific risk analysis for working at height contributed to the accident by failing to reinforce the use of safety harnesses.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Human error and assumptions played a role in the accident, as the crew assumed that working close to the ship side posed little risk (4.4.4). This assumption may have contributed to the deck cadet's decision not to wear a safety harness, leading to his fall when he lost his balance (4.2.2-4.2.4).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Compliance with regulations was an issue, as the operator's Fleet Regulations and the Timber Code clearly stated the need for safety harnesses and fall-restraining devices, yet these were not used by the crew (4.3.2-4.3.3). The lack of compliance with these regulations contributed to the unsafe working conditions that led to the accident.

  explanation: 'There is insufficient information in the document to determine the role of Crew Resource Management in the accident.

    '
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Fatigue was not considered a factor in the deck cadet's death, as he had adequate opportunity for rest in the previous two days (4.1.2).

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Emergency response preparedness did not contribute to the accident, as the post-mortem examination showed that the deck cadet likely died from a critical head injury before falling into the water, making it exceptionally unlikely that immediate efforts to retrieve him would have saved his life (4.2.5).
