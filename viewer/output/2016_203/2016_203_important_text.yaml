  \ of a ship is a hazardous task.  There is a  significant risk of slips, trips \n\
  and falls, the consequences of which are greater when the crew are working at height\
  \ near the \nedge of a log stack.  \n4.1.2  The deck cadet who fell was not an experienced\
  \ seafarer, but he was not new to the lashing \nprocedure either , having participated\
  \ in log -lashing operation s on four other occasions.  He had \nhad adequate opportunity\
  \ for rest in the previous two days, so fatigue is not considered to have \nbeen\
  \ a factor in his death.  Post -mortem testing showed that he was not under the\
  \ influence of \ndrugs or  alcohol.  \n4.1.3  The following analysis discusses briefly\
  \ what happened to cause the deck cadet to fall.  The key \nsafety issues discussed\
  \ include the fact that the deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness \nand, more\
  \ importantly, that no ne of the crew routinely used safety harnesses, despite their\
  \  \nbeing a requirement under the ship's safety management system.  The type of\
  \ safety culture on \nboard that allowed that situation to exist is also discussed.\
  \  \n4.2 The accident  \n4.2.1  The deck cadet was workin g about eight metres above\
  \ the ship's main deck, which was 10 \nmetres above the quayside and 12 metres above\
  \ the water.  He was not wearing a safety \nharness attached to a fall -arrestor\
  \ device.  \n4.2.2  The deck cadet was giving hand signals to the crane driver ,\
  \ indicating the movement s he \nrequired of the crane as he prepared to attach\
  \ the lashing chain to the lifting hook.  Video \nfootage showed him standing at\
  \ the edge of the cargo with his left hand holding the stanchion \nfor security.\
  \  As he bent down to attach the chain to the lifting hook he let go of the stanchion.\
  \  \nUsing both hands, he appeared to have difficulty attaching the chain to the\
  \ hook and partially \nstood before bending down again.  Seconds later he lost his\
  \ balance and fell overboard.   \n4.2.3  It cannot be det ermined with certainty\
  \ what caused the cadet to lose his balance and fall.  The \nvideo footage showed\
  \ that before the cadet had time to step clear and signal the crane driver, \nthe\
  \ main crane hook was already swinging and moving upwards.  It is possible that\
  \  the wire \ncame under tension and caught on some part of his body or clothing,\
  \ or equally possible  that he \njust lost his balance and f ell. \n4.2.4  Once\
  \ the deck cadet lost his balance, there was nothing to prevent hi s falling.  \n\
  4.2.5  The deck cadet was seen to strike the  side of the ship and then the quay\
  \ before falling into the \nwater.  The p ost-mortem examination showed that he\
  \ very likely died from a critical head injury \nbefore falling into the water.\
  \  Therefore it is exceptionally unlikely that the immediate efforts of  \nthe crew\
  \ to find and retrieve him from the water would have saved his life.  \n4.3 Procedures\
  \  \n4.3.1  In three separate ways the operator's ship safety management system\
  \ either directed the crew \nto or advised that the crew wear safety harnesses and\
  \ use fall arrestors wh en they were  lashing \nlogs on deck.  \n4.3.2  The operator's\
  \ Fleet Regulations directed the crew to adhere to the Timber Code, which clearly\
  \ \nstated that crew should be protected from falls with fall -restraint equipment\
  \ such as safety \nharness es and other fall -restrain ing devices ( see 3.4.5)\
  \ . \n4.3.3  The operator's Fleet Regulations further directly stated that \"retractable\
  \ lanyards [fall arrestors], \nsafety harnesses and log spike shoes should form\
  \ part of the PPE while working on log cargoes.  \nWorking on timber deck cargo\
  \ is a  hazardous operation \". \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -203 4.3.4\
  \  The chief officer's cargo logbook contained the written standing order that \"\
  Anyone on the main \ndeck or logs must be worn [sic] 1. safety helmet 2. safety\
  \ shoes and spikes 3. Hi -vis vest 4. \nSafety belt \". \n4.3.5  Before starting\
  \ cargo -lashing  operations on the morning of the accident, the chief officer gave\
  \ a \nbriefing to the crew and reaffirmed that they were to secure the cargo in\
  \ accordance with the \ncargo securing manual.  He even checked that they were wearing\
  \ the correct PPE.  \n4.3.6  Even though t he risk assessment document on board\
  \ did not specifically mention working from \nheight in relation to log -lashing\
  \ operations, there should have been no doubt among everyone \non board, deck officers\
  \ and deck crew, that safety harnesses and fall arrestors were  to be used \nby\
  \ crew members tasked with working near the edge of the log stow.  \n4.4 Procedures\
  \ not followed  \n4.4.1  None of the crew was wearing a safety harness on the day\
  \ of the accident.  On the morning of \nthe accident the chief officer held a briefing\
  \ with the deck  crew; this included assigning their \njobs and carrying out a PPE\
  \ check.  \n4.4.2  The chief officer's standing orders stated what PPE was to be\
  \ worn when working on the logs.  \nThe deck officers all signed to confirm that\
  \ they had read the chief officer's standing o rders.  \nHowever, the deck officers\
  \ did not set an example to the crew by wearing safety harness es \nthemselves,\
  \ nor did they insist that the deck crew wear safety harnesses.  \n4.4.3  Interviews\
  \ with the crew confirmed that the deck crew never used safety harnesses or  fall\
  \ \narrestors when lashing logs on deck.  This violation of the company instructions\
  \ and best \nindustry advice on the matter had become routine.  \n4.4.4  The cadet\
  \ was only five months into his first trip to sea.  The company's expectation was\
  \ for the \ncadet to be mentored by another officer and taught the appropriate safe\
  \ working practices.  \nWhen the cadet was allowed to work at height close to the\
  \ ship's side without using fall -\nprevention  equipment his safety was being jeopardised.\
  \  This may be explained by the be lief \namongst the crew, which was consistent\
  \ throughout all ranks interviewed, that there was little \nrisk associated with\
  \ falling from the log cargo whilst working close to the ship side.  Their \nperception\
  \ of the risk was low.  \n4.5 Safety culture  \n4.5.1  Not wearing app ropriate\
  \ fall -prevention equipment was normal behaviour on Mount Hikurangi .  \nNobody\
  \ questioned  or called a halt to the unsafe practice.  This acceptance of risk\
  \ provided an \ninsight into the underlying safety culture on board Mount Hikurangi\
  \ . \n4.5.2  Safety culture  describes the way that safety is \"perceived, valued\
  \ and prioritised \" throughout an \norganisation. The development  of an effective\
  \ safety culture is dependent on \"foresight, good \norganization and the wholehearted\
  \ support of management and of all seafarers \"10. \n(Organization, 1996)  \n4.5.3\
  \  Having such a safety culture  require s total commitment from the operator and\
  \ crew alike.  The \noperator encouraged a positive safety culture through the safety\
  \ management system, which \nrequired that senior officers motivate and train the\
  \ crew, lead by example and promote \"safe \noperational working practices with\
  \ adequate risk assessment \".   \n4.5.4  The crew were encouraged to carry out\
  \ a 3W dynamic risk assessment to identify hazards and \nappropriate control measures\
  \  prior to \"each and every tas k\".  In this case a 3W assessment \nwas not carried\
  \ out.   \n4.5.5  The internal audit by the operator to assess  the implementation\
  \ of the safety management \nsystem  on board  Mount Hikurangi had been  carried\
  \ out in September 2015. The audit \nidentified strengths, weakne sses and areas\
  \ for improvement.  The auditor recommended that \nall officers and crew adopt a\
  \ proactive approach to help improve the standard s of risk \n                 \

  \  The audit findings were  indicative of a \npoorly dev eloped safety culture on\
  \ board.  \n4.5.6  The auditor's recommendations  to improve safety had been  signed\
  \ off as completed by the \nmaster, but as this accident demonstrated not much had\
  \ actually changed.  \n4.5.7  The deck cadet was on his first trip.  It is very\
  \ unlikely  that he would have challenge d his \nsuperiors about non -compliance\
  \ with a procedure when it was seen by them as routine practice.  \nIf he had been\
  \ made to wear a safety harness connected to a fall arrestor, this would have \n\
  saved his life when he lost his balance while standing on the edge of the log stack.\
  \  \n4.5.8  An illustration  of the safety culture on board was the following day\
  \ when the investigators \nobserved some of  the crew still working atop the log\
  \ cargo without wearing safety harnesses . \n \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>"
