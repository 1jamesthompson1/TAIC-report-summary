The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents  with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that  purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 27 February 2016, the bulk carrier Mount H ikurangi  had just completed loading a cargo of 
logs at the port of Tauranga.  The ship’s crew were involved in applying chain lashings to the 
logs that had been loaded above deck when a deck cadet fell from the stack of logs 10 metres 
onto the wharf below,  then into the sea.  The deck cadet did not survive this fall.  His body was 
recovered by divers a number of hours later.  
1.2. The deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor while working close 
to the edge of the log stack, despite a company requirement to do so.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the crew on Mount 
Hikurangi routinely did not follow company procedures by working on top of log cargo es without 
the required safety harness es. 
1.4. The Comm ission also found  that there was little evidence of a strong safety culture on board 
Mount Hikurangi  at the time.  
1.5. The safety actions  taken by the ship operator and Maritime New Zealand negated the need for 
the Commission to make any recommendations.  
1.6. Key le ssons  arising from the inquiry include:  
 all crew members must wear safety harnesses, preferably connected to fall arrestors, when 
working at height  
 a strong safety culture must be established and promoted from the highest levels of 
management on board a sh ip. It must be encouraged, monitored and enforced throughout 
all levels of the organisation so that best safety practices are followed.

 Final Report MO -2016 -203 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Maritime New Zealand notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  
of the accident at about 1700 on 27 February 2016.  The Commission opened an inquiry the 
same day under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 
and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 28 February 2016 two investigators  travelled to Tauranga and conducted interviews with the 
vessel’s crew and collected evidence , which included video footage of the accident from the 
port security camera.  
2.3. On 29 February 2016 contact was established with the Hong Kong flag administration a nd 
agreement was reached that New Zealand would lead the investigation and conduct the 
investigation on behalf of Hong Kong.  
2.4. On 18 April 2016, with the aid of the Hong Kong flag administration, email correspondence was 
established between the investigator  in charge and the deck cadet’s next of kin, and the 
purpose and role of the Commission were  explained.  
2.5. Additional information was requested from Maritime New Zealand, the vessel’s operator, Port of 
Tauranga and the Coroner.  
2.6. On 22 June 2016 the Commission received the final post -mortem report.  
2.7. On 27 July 2016 the Commission approved the draft report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment.

3. Factual information  
3.1 Background  
3.1.1  At the time of the accident Mount  Hikurangi was preparing to carry a cargo of logs on deck.   
3.1.2  In preparation for loading, the crew rigged stanchions1 on both sides of the ship adjacent to all 
of the hatches , to retain the logs in a block stow.  Once the logs were loaded, a series of wire 
and chain lashings was rigged across  the entire stow to secure the logs.  
3.1.3  The procedure for securing log cargo on Mount Hikurangi  was laid down in the approved ship’s 
cargo securing manual.  
3.1.4  Chapter 5 of the operator’s Fleet Regulations  also laid down the voyage procedure when 
carrying a car go of logs.  In respect of lashing deck cargo, paragraph 13 of the procedure made 
reference to the International Maritime Organi zation’s Timber Code : Code of Safe Practice for 
Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes 2011 (Timber Code) and the ship’s cargo secur ing manual.  
Specifically , it referred to the requirement for rigging lumber lashing chains, also known as top -
over lashing chains2.  
3.1.5  Each top -over lashing chain was shackled to a deck eye -plate3.  The other end of the chain had 
a rope eye attached through  the last link.  The rope eye was suspended over the top of each 
stanchion ( see Figure 4) so that the chain was easily accessible whilst lashing the logs.  At the 
time of the accident the crew were rigging the chain lashings ( see Figures 1 and 2).  They us ed 
a ship’s crane to haul each chain inboard over the logs.  
3.1.6  One at a time, the port and starboard lashing chains were lifted across the logs by the ship’s 
crane.  They were connected near the centreline with a turnbuckle4, which was used to increase 
the t ension in the chains.  The tension increased the vertical friction force between the logs at 
the outer part of the stow and, together with other types of lashing, helped to achieve a secure 
stow.  The final lashing configuration was the same at all hatches  (see Figures 1 and 2).  
 
                                                        
1 A stanchion is a removable vertical steel pillar or post placed in deck sockets and used to contain 
timber  deck cargo . 
2 A top -over lashing chain is a chain secured by a shackle to a deck eye fitting then run vertically up the 
side of the deck cargo and then across the top.  Two top -over chain lashings are rigged, one from the 
port and one from the starboard s ide.  They are joined in the middle by a turnbuckle that also allows 
them to be tensioned . 
3 A deck eye -plate is a steel fixing welded to the deck to provide a securing eye . 
4 A turnbuckle is a connecting device , normally  used with cable or chain , that takes up slack by rotating 
on its screw threads .

3.2 Narrative  
3.2.1  At 1530  on 2 4 February 2016, the Hong Kong -registered bulk carrier Mount Hikurangi  secured 
portside alongside number nine berth in the port of Tauranga in a ballast (empty) condition.   
3.2.2  At 2015 the vessel commenced loading a full cargo of logs in the cargo holds and o n top of the 
hatch covers as deck cargo.  The loading of logs continued for the next three days.

 3.2.3  At about 0600 on 27 February 2016, a ship’s cargo securing team comprising the boatswain 
(bosun)5, three  able-bodied  seam en (AB)6 one ordinary seaman  and a d eck cadet7 were  
securing the log cargo above number 5 hatch.   
3.2.4  The weather was fine and dry.  There had been some rain the previous evening but the surface 
of the logs was dry at the time of the accident.  
3.2.5  Before the crew commenced work the chief officer br iefed them to secure the cargo in 
accordance with the instructions contained in the cargo securing manual.  At the same time, he 
checked that they were wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).  The cadet 
was dressed in a n overall, safety he lmet, high -visibility vest and safety boots fitted with 
removable pull -over spikes designed for walking on logs.   On completion of the briefing the crew 
commenced securing the log cargo above number 5 hatch.   
3.2.6  At about 0900 on 27 February 2016, all cargo l oading operations had been completed.  The 
crew  that had secured the log cargo above number 5 hatch commenced securing the log cargo 
above number 2 hatch , using number 1 crane to haul the chains across the logs ( see Figure 3).

3.2.7  The crew used a short wire strop and small hook attached to the main crane hook to drag the 
chains across the logs.  The bosun had tasked the deck cadet with hooking each lashing chain 
on to the small hook  (see Figure 4).

3.2.8  At about 0911 the deck cadet positioned himself adjacent to the aftermo st stanchion on the 
port side of number 2 hatch in preparation for hooking on the lashing chain.  He was standing at 
the edge of the log cargo about eight metres above the ship’s main deck, which was 10 metres 
above the quay and 12 metres above the waterli ne.  As the lifting hook was lowered in front of 
him he bent down to hook on the lashing chain , which had been hung over the top of the 
stanchion with the rope eye ( see Figure 4).  Once the cadet had hooked the chain on  to the 
lifting hook he stood up and remained next to the stanchion whilst the crane driver hoisted and 
slewed the crane to drag the chain across the logs, where it was unhooked by the bosun.  The 
crane hook was then returned to the port side to receive the second lashing chain.  
3.2.9  The cadet gra bbed the wire and bent down to hook on the second lashing chain.  He stood up 
momentarily before bending down again.  About four seconds later, as the main crane hook was 
being raised, the cadet fell overboard, striking the quay and falling into the water.   The bosun 
raised the alarm on his portable radio.   
3.2.10  The deck lashing crew ran to the ship’s side and the third officer went down to the quayside 
with a lifebuoy.  The master, who was in his cabin at the time, heard the emergency call on his 
portable radi o and went to the port bridge wing.  He called the emergency services and the 
ship’s commercial agent.   
3.2.11  At about 0930 a police patrol boat arrived and commenced searching for the cadet.  HMNZS  
Manawanui  was also berthed in Tauranga at the time of the acci dent.  The crew of Manawanui  
were alerted by the police and responded by providing divers to search for the cadet.   
3.2.12  At about 1150 the divers entered the water and about 10 minutes later they located the cadet’s 
body.  
3.3 Experience of the deck cadet  
3.3.1  The deck cadet had commenced employment with Pacific Basin Shipping (HK) Limited on 17 
September 2015.  He had joined Mount Hikurangi , his first vessel, on 22 September 2015.   
3.3.2  The cadet had completed the joiner’s familiarisation checklist within 48 hours of joinin g, as 
required by the operator’s safety management system.  This included familiarisation with the top-over 
lashing chain

 permit to work8 system on board in relation to enclosed space procedures, working aloft and hot 
work.   
3.3.3  The cadet had been involved in loading and dischargin g logs on four previous occasions.   
3.3.4  Prior to the accident  on 27 February, the cadet had rested for 16.5 hours on 26 February and 
had had six hours of rest on 27 February prior to commencing work at 0600.  Fatigue is not 
considered to have been a contribut ing factor to the accident.  
3.4 Hazard identification and risk assessment  
3.4.1  The operator’s  Fleet Regulations addressed risk management using the following process:  
 assessing operational tasks at all levels for the possibility to cause injury, damage or 
loss. Th e ‘Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment’ document on board provided 
generic risk assessments for onboard operations  
 periodic review s of the document to ensure that any additional hazards and risks in 
operations on board were identified and discussed b efore carrying out the operation s 
 six-monthly formal review s by the master  
 a brief and informal risk assessment prior to “each and every task ”.  This was described 
as a “3W” risk assessment where the following questions were posed:  
1. What can go wrong?  
2. Wha t factors can cause it to go wrong?  
3. What should be done to prevent it going wrong?   
There was no requirement to record that the 3W risk assessment had taken place.  
3.4.2  There was a risk assessment for “working aloft ” and “over the side ” that did consider fall ing 
from height and falling overboard.  The control measures included, but were not limited to:  
 consideration be given to working under the permit -to-work system  
 young or inexperienced persons not required to work aloft or over the side 
unless accompanied  by experienced seafarer s or under adequate supervision  
 all seafarers are required to wear safety harnesses, and safety nets are to 
be rigged where appropriate.   
3.4.3  A risk assessment and hazard identification had been carried out by the operator for loading 
logs, but it had not identified falling from height during lashing operations as a hazard.   
3.4.4  However, the operator’s  Fleet Regulations referred to access and the safety of the crew when 
working on logs.  It stated that:  
retractable lanyards (fall arrestors ), safety harnesses and log spike shoes should 
form part of the PPE while working on log cargoes.  Working on timber deck 
cargo is a hazardous operation and only the deck crew should be permitted to 
work on timber deck cargo  
3.4.5  The Fleet Regulations also requ ired adherence to the International Maritime Organi zation’s 
Timber Code. This code included guidance for developing procedures and checklists for the safe 
loading, carriage and discharge of timber deck cargoes.  It stated that:  
                                                        
8 The permit -to-work system is a safety measure whereby seafarers must g et written permission from senior 
officers before they can perform high -risk tasks including, but not limited to, working aloft, welding and entry 
to enclosed spaces. An operator’s safety management system will identify which activities must be carried 
out under a permit to work.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -203 Personnel working on cargo s towed at heights 2m and above, within 1m of an 
unguarded edge, should if deemed necessary be protected from falls with fall 
restraint equipment such as a safety harness or other fall restraining devices 
approved by the Administration.  
3.4.6  An entry in the chief  officer’s cargo logbook, written on 24 February 2016, included a standing  
order that:  
Anyone on the main deck or logs must be worn (sic) 1. safety helmet 2. safety 
shoes and spikes 3. Hi -vis vest 4. Safety belt  
3.4.7  The following  PPE was available to the crew involved in cargo securing operations:  
 boots 
 attachable boot spikes (to assist movement when walking on top of logs)  
 gloves  
 safety helmets  
 full-body safety harnesses  
 fall-arrestor devices . 
There were 12 safety harnesses and six fall -arrestors9 on board.  
3.5 Internal audit  
3.5.1  The operator had carried out an internal audit of Mount Hikurangi  about five months before the 
accident, between 8 and 10 September 2015.  In respect of the safety management system the 
audit  identified two non -conformities and seven observa tions.  The senior  officers on board 
Mount Hikurangi  at the time of the accident were also on board at the time of the audit.  
3.5.2  Of the two non -conformities identified by the auditor, non -conformity number 02/2015 required 
corrective  action by:  
Regular inspe ction to be strictly carried out to verify training effectiveness.  A 
special officers meeting held to enhance critical importance of safety practice – 
not tick box culture.  
3.5.3  Amongst the recommendations for continual improvement , the auditor recommended tha t all 
officers and crew take a positive interest in and adopt a proactive approach to enhancing loss -
prevention techniques:  
This will help to improve on 3W risk assessment and hazard identification, self -check 
and taking adequate safety measures to preven t any accident/incidents and personal 
injury.  
The auditor also recommended that the crew be encouraged to carry out risk assessments for 
both critical and routine jobs.

 4. Analysis  
4.1 General  
4.1.1  Lashing logs on the deck of a ship is a hazardous task.  There is a  significant risk of slips, trips 
and falls, the consequences of which are greater when the crew are working at height near the 
edge of a log stack.  
4.1.2  The deck cadet who fell was not an experienced seafarer, but he was not new to the lashing 
procedure either , having participated in log -lashing operation s on four other occasions.  He had 
had adequate opportunity for rest in the previous two days, so fatigue is not considered to have 
been a factor in his death.  Post -mortem testing showed that he was not under the influence of 
drugs or  alcohol.  
4.1.3  The following analysis discusses briefly what happened to cause the deck cadet to fall.  The key 
safety issues discussed include the fact that the deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness 
and, more importantly, that no ne of the crew routinely used safety harnesses, despite their  
being a requirement under the ship’s safety management system.  The type of safety culture on 
board that allowed that situation to exist is also discussed.  
4.2 The accident  
4.2.1  The deck cadet was workin g about eight metres above the ship’s main deck, which was 10 
metres above the quayside and 12 metres above the water.  He was not wearing a safety 
harness attached to a fall -arrestor device.  
4.2.2  The deck cadet was giving hand signals to the crane driver , indicating the movement s he 
required of the crane as he prepared to attach the lashing chain to the lifting hook.  Video 
footage showed him standing at the edge of the cargo with his left hand holding the stanchion 
for security.  As he bent down to attach the chain to the lifting hook he let go of the stanchion.  
Using both hands, he appeared to have difficulty attaching the chain to the hook and partially 
stood before bending down again.  Seconds later he lost his balance and fell overboard.   
4.2.3  It cannot be det ermined with certainty what caused the cadet to lose his balance and fall.  The 
video footage showed that before the cadet had time to step clear and signal the crane driver, 
the main crane hook was already swinging and moving upwards.  It is possible that  the wire 
came under tension and caught on some part of his body or clothing, or equally possible  that he 
just lost his balance and f ell. 
4.2.4  Once the deck cadet lost his balance, there was nothing to prevent hi s falling.  
4.2.5  The deck cadet was seen to strike the  side of the ship and then the quay before falling into the 
water.  The p ost-mortem examination showed that he very likely died from a critical head injury 
before falling into the water.  Therefore it is exceptionally unlikely that the immediate efforts of  
the crew to find and retrieve him from the water would have saved his life.  
4.3 Procedures  
4.3.1  In three separate ways the operator’s ship safety management system either directed the crew 
to or advised that the crew wear safety harnesses and use fall arrestors wh en they were  lashing 
logs on deck.  
4.3.2  The operator’s Fleet Regulations directed the crew to adhere to the Timber Code, which clearly 
stated that crew should be protected from falls with fall -restraint equipment such as safety 
harness es and other fall -restrain ing devices ( see 3.4.5) . 
4.3.3  The operator’s Fleet Regulations further directly stated that “retractable lanyards [fall arrestors], 
safety harnesses and log spike shoes should form part of the PPE while working on log cargoes.  
Working on timber deck cargo is a  hazardous operation ”. 

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -203 4.3.4  The chief officer’s cargo logbook contained the written standing order that “Anyone on the main 
deck or logs must be worn [sic] 1. safety helmet 2. safety shoes and spikes 3. Hi -vis vest 4. 
Safety belt ”. 
4.3.5  Before starting cargo -lashing  operations on the morning of the accident, the chief officer gave a 
briefing to the crew and reaffirmed that they were to secure the cargo in accordance with the 
cargo securing manual.  He even checked that they were wearing the correct PPE.  
4.3.6  Even though t he risk assessment document on board did not specifically mention working from 
height in relation to log -lashing operations, there should have been no doubt among everyone 
on board, deck officers and deck crew, that safety harnesses and fall arrestors were  to be used 
by crew members tasked with working near the edge of the log stow.  
4.4 Procedures not followed  
4.4.1  None of the crew was wearing a safety harness on the day of the accident.  On the morning of 
the accident the chief officer held a briefing with the deck  crew; this included assigning their 
jobs and carrying out a PPE check.  
4.4.2  The chief officer’s standing orders stated what PPE was to be worn when working on the logs.  
The deck officers all signed to confirm that they had read the chief officer’s standing o rders.  
However, the deck officers did not set an example to the crew by wearing safety harness es 
themselves, nor did they insist that the deck crew wear safety harnesses.  
4.4.3  Interviews with the crew confirmed that the deck crew never used safety harnesses or  fall 
arrestors when lashing logs on deck.  This violation of the company instructions and best 
industry advice on the matter had become routine.  
4.4.4  The cadet was only five months into his first trip to sea.  The company’s expectation was for the 
cadet to be mentored by another officer and taught the appropriate safe working practices.  
When the cadet was allowed to work at height close to the ship’s side without using fall -
prevention  equipment his safety was being jeopardised.  This may be explained by the be lief 
amongst the crew, which was consistent throughout all ranks interviewed, that there was little 
risk associated with falling from the log cargo whilst working close to the ship side.  Their 
perception of the risk was low.  
4.5 Safety culture  
4.5.1  Not wearing app ropriate fall -prevention equipment was normal behaviour on Mount Hikurangi .  
Nobody questioned  or called a halt to the unsafe practice.  This acceptance of risk provided an 
insight into the underlying safety culture on board Mount Hikurangi . 
4.5.2  Safety culture  describes the way that safety is “perceived, valued and prioritised ” throughout an 
organisation. The development  of an effective safety culture is dependent on “foresight, good 
organization and the wholehearted support of management and of all seafarers ”10. 
(Organization, 1996)  
4.5.3  Having such a safety culture  require s total commitment from the operator and crew alike.  The 
operator encouraged a positive safety culture through the safety management system, which 
required that senior officers motivate and train the crew, lead by example and promote “safe 
operational working practices with adequate risk assessment ”.   
4.5.4  The crew were encouraged to carry out a 3W dynamic risk assessment to identify hazards and 
appropriate control measures  prior to “each and every tas k”.  In this case a 3W assessment 
was not carried out.   
4.5.5  The internal audit by the operator to assess  the implementation of the safety management 
system  on board  Mount Hikurangi had been  carried out in September 2015. The audit 
identified strengths, weakne sses and areas for improvement.  The auditor recommended that 
all officers and crew adopt a proactive approach to help improve the standard s of risk

 assessment, hazard identification and safety awareness.  The audit findings were  indicative of a 
poorly dev eloped safety culture on board.  
4.5.6  The auditor’s recommendations  to improve safety had been  signed off as completed by the 
master, but as this accident demonstrated not much had actually changed.  
4.5.7  The deck cadet was on his first trip.  It is very unlikely  that he would have challenge d his 
superiors about non -compliance with a procedure when it was seen by them as routine practice.  
If he had been made to wear a safety harness connected to a fall arrestor, this would have 
saved his life when he lost his balance while standing on the edge of the log stack.  
4.5.8  An illustration  of the safety culture on board was the following day when the investigators 
observed some of  the crew still working atop the log cargo without wearing safety harnesses .

 Final Report MO -2016 -203 5. Findings  
5.1 The deck c adet suffered a head injury when he fell some 10 metres to the quay before falling 
into the water.  The reason for his  fall could not be conclusively established.  
5.2 The deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor.  If he had b een it is 
virtually certain that he would not have lost his life.  
5.3 Company policy and procedures required that all crew working near the edge of a log stack on 
deck wore  safety harness es attached to fall arrestor s.  However, the crew routinely did not 
comply with those company requirements.  
5.4 There was little evidence of a good safety culture on board Mount Hikurangi .

 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1 The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an ope rator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues that 
would not norm ally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
   Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2 Safety actions taken by the operator of Mount Hikurangi  
After  the accident the operator, Pacific Basin Shipping, issued a ri sk assessment circular ( see 
the Appendix) to all masters, deck officers and seafarers. It identified the risk of falling 
overboard when working close to the unguarded edge of the ship and instructed that:   
1. No person shall be permitted to commence work on log cargoes until the master and/or 
chief officer have completed a safety briefing and made an entry in the deck logbook.  
2. Work hour s and rest hours shall be strictly adhered to , to avoid fatigue -related accidents.  
3. Only deck crew are permitted to work on lo g cargoes.  
4. Deck cadets and deck trainees shall be supervised during log operations until they have six 
months ’ sea service and experience with log voyages.  
5. Each team shall consist of at least four people , with at least one officer or bosun and one 
AB in the team. One person with at least six months ’ experience in log carriage shall be 
assigned as the team leader.  
6. The team leader shall explain the work scope and assign tasks to each member of their  
team and confirm that all safety precautions have been under stood and are complied with 
at all times.  
7. As far as possible, avoid pulling up lashing chains at night. If unavoidable, ensure sufficient 
lighting is provided to illuminate the working areas on deck.  
8. Two working zones have been identified for any work on l ogs:  
 A yellow caution zone on top of the logs in the area more than three metres from the 
side of the ship. To work in the yellow zone, the prescribed PPE is overalls, leather 
gloves, safety shoes with spikes, helmet with chinstrap and a full body harness  with 
lanyard.  
 A red danger zone within three metres of the ship side where only two persons per 
hatch may work at any one time. This zone carries a high risk of falling overboard and 
the operator requires that anybody working in the red zone wear the ful l PPE prescribed 
for the yellow zone plus a fall prevention device and a lightweight flotation device.  
6.3 Safety action taken by Maritime New Zealand  
As a result of this accident Maritime New Zealand is currently in the process of writing a safety 
bulleti n to be distributed to the New Zealand maritime industry.  The safety bulletin will highlight 
the inherent dangers involved with working at height and close to unguarded edges.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -203 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1 The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommen dations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case no new r ecommendations have been issued.   
7.2 Safety actions taken have negated the need to make any recommendations .

<< Page 15 >>
 8. Key lessons  
8.1 All crew members must wear safety harnesses, preferably connected to fall arrestors, when 
working at height . 
8.2 A strong safety culture must be established and promoted from the highest levels of 
management on board a ship. It must be encouraged, monitored and enforced throughout all 
levels of the organisation so that best safety practices are followed.

Safety of Crew during Securing/Lashing and Carriage of Log Cargoes  
The tragic accident resulting in the death of a PB deck cadet on 27 February 2016 at T auranga, 
NZ has highlighted again the very serious risks associated with the carriage of logs, especially 
working with lashing and securing this cargo. The risks increase to dangerous levels when 
working closer to the ship sides.  
Risks:   
Falling overboard  when working close to the unguarded edge of the ship  
2. Injury from falls on uneven cargo   
3. Injury from cargo (crushing, impact etc.)   
4. Injury from moving ship’s machinery/equipment (cranes, blocks, wires)  Requirements 
prior to doing any work on log cargoes:   
Master must ensure the following without exception :   
1. No person shall be permitted to commence any work on log cargoes until the 
Master and/or Chief Officer has completed a safety briefing and made an entry in 
the deck log book.  
2. Work hour and rest hours  shall be strictly adhered to avoid fatigue related incidents.   
3. Only deck crew is permitted to do any work on log cargoes.   
4. Deck cadets, deck trainees shall be supervised during log operations, until they have 6 
months sea service and experience with log  voyages.  
5. Each team shall consist of at least 4 people  with at least one Officer/Bosun and one 
SM1/AB in a team. One person (Officer/Bosun/SM1) with at least 6 months experience in 
log carriage shall be assigned as the Team Leader of each team.  
6. Team lead er shall explain the work scope and assign tasks to each member of his team 
and confirm all safety precautions are understood and are complied with at all times.   
7. As far as possible, avoid carrying out pulling up foot wires & lashing chains at night. If 
unavoidable, ensure sufficient lighting is provided to illuminate the working areas on deck.  
Working procedure:   
1. Two working zones are to be established and understood for any work on logs:   
a. YELLOW  Zone – CAUTION   
b. RED Zone – DANGER   
2. The correct workin g gear must be worn at all times including:
