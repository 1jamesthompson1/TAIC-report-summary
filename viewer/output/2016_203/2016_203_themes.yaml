- name: Use of Safety Harnesses
  explanation: The use of safety harnesses is a critical safety theme in this accident. The deck cadet was working at a significant height above the deck and was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall-arrestor device, which is a direct violation of the ship's safety management system requirements. "the deck cadet was working about eight metres above the ship's main deck... he was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall-arrestor device" (4.2.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The absence of a safety harness directly contributed to the severity of the accident, as "If he had been [wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor] it is virtually certain that he would not have lost his life" (5.2). This theme is relevant because the proper use of safety harnesses could have prevented the fall or at least mitigated the consequences.
- name: Safety Culture
  explanation: Safety culture is a theme that is deeply intertwined with this accident. The report indicates that not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was normal behavior on the ship, and nobody questioned or called a halt to the unsafe practice. "Not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was normal behaviour on Mount Hikurangi" (4.5.1). This acceptance of risk and the lack of proactive safety measures reflect a poorly developed safety culture onboard, as evidenced by the internal audit findings and the continuation of unsafe practices even after the accident. "The audit findings were indicative of a poorly developed safety culture on board" (4.5.5). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that a strong safety culture could have encouraged compliance with safety procedures and potentially prevented the accident.
- name: Compliance with Safety Procedures
  explanation: Compliance with safety procedures is a significant safety theme in this accident. The crew's routine non-compliance with the requirement to wear safety harnesses and use fall arrestors when lashing logs on deck is a clear example. "None of the crew was wearing a safety harness on the day of the accident" (4.4.1), and "the crew routinely did not comply with those company requirements" (5.3). This theme is relevant because adherence to established safety procedures is fundamental to preventing accidents, and the lack of compliance in this case was a direct factor in the occurrence and severity of the accident.
- name: Leadership and Example Setting
  explanation: Leadership and example setting is a theme that played a role in this accident. The deck officers, including the chief officer, did not set an example for the crew by wearing safety harnesses themselves, nor did they insist that the deck crew wear them. "However, the deck officers did not set an example to the crew by wearing safety harnesses themselves" (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because leadership behavior strongly influences crew practices and attitudes towards safety. Effective leadership could have ensured adherence to safety protocols and possibly prevented the accident.
- name: Risk Perception
  explanation: Risk perception is a theme that is evident in the accident. The crew, including the deck cadet, underestimated the risk associated with working at height near the ship's side. "Their perception of the risk was low" (4.4.4). This theme is relevant because an accurate perception of risk is crucial for recognizing the need for and the use of safety measures. If the crew had a higher awareness of the risks, they might have been more diligent in using fall-prevention equipment.
- name: Training and Mentorship
  explanation: Training and mentorship is a theme that emerges from the circumstances of the accident. The deck cadet was relatively inexperienced and was expected to be mentored by another officer and taught appropriate safe working practices. "The company's expectation was for the cadet to be mentored by another officer and taught the appropriate safe working practices" (4.4.4). This theme is relevant because proper training and mentorship are essential for ensuring that all crew members, especially new ones, understand and follow safety procedures. In this case, the lack of effective mentorship contributed to the cadet working without fall-prevention equipment, leading to the fatal outcome.
