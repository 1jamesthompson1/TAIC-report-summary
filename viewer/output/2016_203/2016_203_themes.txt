Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of safety harnesses and fall arrestors: The deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor, and none of the crew routinely used safety harnesses, despite it being a requirement under the ship's safety management system.

2. Failure to follow procedures: The crew did not follow the operator's ship safety management system, which directed them to wear safety harnesses and use fall arrestors when lashing logs on deck. The chief officer's standing orders stated what PPE was to be worn, but the deck officers did not set an example by wearing safety harnesses themselves, nor did they insist that the deck crew wear them.

3. Poor safety culture: Not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was normal behavior on the ship, and there was an acceptance of risk. The underlying safety culture on board Mount Hikurangi was lacking, as evidenced by the crew's failure to question or call a halt to the unsafe practice and the lack of commitment to safety from both the operator and crew.
