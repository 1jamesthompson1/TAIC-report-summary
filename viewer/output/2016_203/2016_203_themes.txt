Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of safety equipment and procedures: The report highlights that the deck cadet was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor, and none of the crew routinely used safety harnesses, despite it being a requirement under the ship's safety management system. The crew did not comply with company policies and procedures regarding the use of safety harnesses.

2. Failure to follow procedures: The report states that the crew did not follow the operator's Fleet Regulations and the chief officer's standing orders regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety harnesses. The deck officers did not set an example by wearing safety harnesses themselves, and the crew never used safety harnesses or fall arrestors when lashing logs on deck.

3. Poor safety culture: The report highlights the lack of a good safety culture on board the ship. Not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was considered normal behavior, and nobody questioned or called a halt to the unsafe practice. The crew's perception of the risk associated with falling from the log cargo was low. The internal audit identified a poorly developed safety culture on board.

4. Uncertain cause of the accident: The report states that it cannot be determined with certainty what caused the cadet to lose his balance and fall. It is possible that the wire came under tension and caught on some part of his body or clothing, or he simply lost his balance and fell. However, it is noted that if the cadet had been wearing a safety harness connected to a fall arrestor, it would have saved his life.

5. Inadequate training and mentoring: The report mentions that the cadet was only five months into his first trip to sea and was expected to be mentored by another officer and taught the appropriate safe working practices. However, he was allowed to work at height close to the ship's side without using fall-prevention equipment, jeopardizing his safety.

6. Lack of enforcement and accountability: The report highlights that the crew's non-compliance with safety procedures and the lack of a good safety culture were not effectively addressed or changed despite recommendations from audits and signed-off improvements by the master. The lack of enforcement and accountability contributed to the continuation of unsafe practices.
