  \ Operating a boat in adverse weather conditions, particularly when carrying passengers,\
  \ \ncan be ha zardous. The Henerata  was operating a water taxi service in the Paters\
  \ on Inlet \narea of Stewart Island when it capsized . The skipper and six passengers\
  \ remained in the \nwater for over an hou r, holding on to  the hull of the upturned\
  \ vessel . Three local \nvessel s assisted in recovering everyone from the water\
  \ , and a fourth vessel righted the  \nHenerata  and towed it back to Golden Bay.\
  \   \n3.2 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event\
  \ to identify \nthose factors that increased the likelihood of t he event occurring\
  \ or increased the \nseverity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues\
  \  that have the potential to \nadversely affect future operations.  \nPlanning\
  \ and decision to operate the service  \n3.3 A large proportion of accidents involving\
  \ small vessels are weather related. Bad \nweather can make the environment on \
  \ board a vessel extremely hazardous. It can also \nplace a lot of strain on the\
  \ vessel's structure and equipment and the people on \nboard20.  \n3.4 Therefore,\
  \ prior to sailing, a skipper  should develop a plan for the  voyage and \ndetermine\
  \ whether it is safe to sail. I t is essential that as part of this plan ning the\
  \ \nskipper obtain an up-to-date marine weather forecast and tid al information\
  \  for their \nboating area.  This information should be considered in conjunction\
  \ with:  \n\u2022 the vessel and its capabilities  \n\u2022 the intended operations\
  \  \n\u2022 the operating area . \n3.5 The operator's MTOP required skippers to\
  \ take weather and sea conditions into \nconsideration for ensuring pass enger safety.\
  \ The MTOP specified, as a minimum, the \nfollowing decision criteria for skippers:\
  \  \n\u2022 the current and forecast weather conditions and sea state  \n\u2022\
  \ visibility  \n\u2022 tidal flows (including any changes that could result in wind\
  \ against tide ) \n\u2022 traffic density  \n\u2022 the health, mobility and comfort\
  \ of all persons on board  \n\u2022 any other information relevant to the safety\
  \ of the operation.  \n3.6 On the day of the accident  the skipper  obtained and\
  \ considered the information  \nidentified in the MTOP  to assist  them  in making\
  \ a  decision on whether to proceed. \nHaving  operated the Henerata in similar\
  \ weather  conditions  many times,  the skipper \nrecalled  determin ing that it\
  \ was safe to proceed  based on their knowledge and \nexperience . The operator\
  \ 's MTOP  had no defined weather criteria  against which \n \n20 Maritime New Zealand\
  \ - https://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/recreational/safety/weather . \nFinal Report\
  \ MO -2019 -204 \n<< Page 11 >>\n skippers could  assess the forecast weather. This\
  \ is discussed further in 'Operator 's \nMaritime Transport Operator Plan considerations\
  \ '. \n3.7 The Henerata's  design approval and Certificate of Survey included operating\
  \ limits \nexpressed as a wave height versus speed table. The maximum wave height\
  \ on the table \nwas two metres . While the nearest swell forecast for the Foveaux\
  \ Strait area  was above \nthe specified wave height, the Paterson Inlet area 's\
  \ location and topography meant its \nconditions  would have likely differed from\
  \ th ose forecast . Some parts of the voyage \nwould very likely have been milder\
  \ than the nearest  swell  forecast due to the \nprotection afforded by the local\
  \ area. Conditions in o ther parts , such as  those in the \nposition of the accident\
  \ , may have been closer to those forecast.  \n3.8 The accident area  was known\
  \ locally to be subject to steep, confused seas , particularly \nwhen the tidal\
  \ flow act ed in the opposite direction to the wind. The boundary between \nthe\
  \ channelled sand bars of the Freshwater Flats and the deeper water in Paterson\
  \ Inlet \ncreated variable interaction s betwee n the seabed and water flow.  \n\
  3.9 MetService carried out a forensic weather assessment for the Transport Accident\
  \ \nInvestigation Commission  (Commission)  to try to determine the expected sea\
  \ \nconditions for the forecast wind speed on the day of the accident. Its report\
  \ stated  that \nwave heights should have been a n estimated  three -quarters of\
  \ a metre. While the \nforensic weather assessment did not appear to match the actual\
  \ conditions on the day, \nit did show  that conditions in the inlet were difficult\
  \ to predict . \n3.10 To mitigate some of the risk s associated with the weather\
  \ conditions , the skipper  \nplanned the Henerata 's schedule to ensure that the\
  \ pick -up time for the passengers \nfrom Freshwater Hut coincided with the high\
  \ -water  time at Bluff , which was predict ed \nto occur at 1252. This was to ensure,\
  \ so far as possible, that the outgoing tide and the \nprevailing wind would act\
  \  in the same direction for the eastbound return trip through \nPaterson Inlet.\
  \ Sea conditions should have been calmer during this period, hel ping to \nreduce\
  \ the risk to passengers of vessel movement s in rough conditions associated with\
  \ \nwind against tide . This shows that the skipper  had considered the intended\
  \ operations \nand the operation area and attempted to mitigate the risk s associated\
  \ with t he \nweather conditions.   \nSelf-perceived pressure  \n3.11 As there were\
  \  no communication faciliti es available at Freshwater Hut, there was no \nway\
  \ for the skipper to contact the passengers awaiting the water taxi  service.  The\
  \ \nskipper reported that  although drop -off trips to Freshwater Hut were often\
  \ cancelled, \npassenger pick -ups were rarely cancelled due to the lack of communication\
  \ facilities .  \n3.12 This lack of communication was about as likely as not to\
  \ have  resulted in  a self-\nperceived pressure  on the skipper  to pick up the\
  \ passengers . The operator has since \namended its booking information provided\
  \ to passengers to notify them that \ncancellations are possible and that they should\
  \ be prepared to stay overnight should \ncancellations  occur.  \nConduct of the\
  \ service  and capsize  \n3.13 While exiting  the Freshwater River and crossing\
  \ the Freshwater Flats  on the return \njourney , the skipper  observed  that the\
  \ wind speed had increased and sea conditions \nhad worsened since the outward trip.\
  \ Although the predicted time of high water had \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report\
  \ MO -2019 -204 already passed , it is about as  likely as not that there was still\
  \  some residual flood tide. \nThe skipper considered , but decided against , diverting\
  \ to Freds Camp and waiting to \nensure that the tide had turned  to reduce the\
  \ risk from  adverse  sea conditions.  \nThe skipper 's decision t o carry on  should\
  \ have prompt ed a re-examin ation of  the risks \nto which  the passengers were\
  \ potentially exposed. Ideally  the passengers  would have \nbeen provided  with\
  \ and donned lifejackets  and muster ed in the most appropriate \nposition ; any\
  \ safety instructions  would have been repeated ; and a safety call would \nhave\
  \ been made using VHF radio.   \n3.14 The skipper and the passengers recalled the\
  \ sea conditions just before  the Henerata  \ncapsized as confused , with breaking\
  \  waves about two to three metres in height. With \nthe offshore wind at the western\
  \ end of Paterson Inlet , the waves would have been in a \ndeveloping phase and\
  \ therefore choppy and asymmetric. The combination of wind \nspeed, the nature of\
  \ the seabed and the tidal flow create d steep er-than-normal  and \nunpredictable\
  \ seas. In summary , it is about as likely as not th at the sea conditions at \n\
  the time of the accident were considerably more severe than predicted in the weather\
  \ \nforecast.   \n3.15 An inspection of the vessel by the Commission's investigators\
  \ found no anomalies that \nwould have prevented it operating correctly. An inspection\
  \ of the engine found no \ndefects that would have prevented it producing power\
  \ . Similarly, the skipper did not \nrecall any mechanical issues and recalled the\
  \ vessel becoming overwhelmed by the \nsteep and unpredictable seas . Therefore,\
  \ the Commission f ound that the vessel capsize \nwas almost certainly a result\
  \ of the vessel broaching in the steep and unpredictable  \nseas.  \nEvents  after\
  \ the capsize  \n3.16 At the time of the capsize t he passengers were not wearing\
  \ their lifejacket s. It is to the \nskipper's credit that they re-entered the upturned\
  \ hull and guided the passengers out \nthrough the forward hatch. Had the skipper\
  \  not done so , the consequence s of this \naccident could have been more severe\
  \ .  \n3.17 While the vessel had an EPIRB on  board, the skipper was unable to reach\
  \  and activate  it \nwhen the vessel capsized . Had the vessel been fitted with\
  \ a float -free EPIRB it would \nhave  automatically notified authorities once the\
  \ capsize occurred. The operator has \nsince relocated the EPIRB s on its vessels\
  \  closer to the helm position and fitted the  \nvessels  with float -free EPIRBs.\
  \  \n3.18 While the passenger s were not wearing lifejackets at the time, had they\
  \ been they may \nhave had problems in their egress from the upturned hull. The\
  \ permanent buoyancy of \nthe lifejackets would have made it difficult for the passengers\
  \ to swim down and out of \nthe forward hatch. The operator has since changed the\
  \ lifejackets on board to manually \ninflatable ones  that are less bulky (see Figure\
  \ 8) and in the event of a capsize can be \ninflated after escaping the vessel .\
  \  \n\n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2019 -204 Weather criteria  \n3.25\
  \ Established weather criteria take into consideration a vessel and its capabilities,\
  \ alo ng \nwith information on the intended operations , and provide crew with the\
  \ worst weather \n(limits) in which an operation can be safely performed  (The Norwegian\
  \ Commission of \nInquiry into the loss of the \"Bourbon Dolphin\", 2008) . If the\
  \ operator had developed \nand set predefined weather criteria , all the appropriate\
  \ considerations  in this incident \nwould  have been  taken into account , resulting\
  \ in a more consistent approach to \ndeciding when to sail . Weather criteria should\
  \ be set  cautiously  to ensure they take \ninto account any limitations in the\
  \ information available to skippers. Weather criteria \ndo not preclude skippers\
  \ cancelling operations in less  severe weather conditions based \non their own\
  \ judgement .  \n3.26 The operator had not includ ed predefined weather criteria\
  \ in its MTOP. This resulted in \nthe skipper having to make a  critical safety\
  \  decision on the weather without any criteria \nagainst which to assess it. While\
  \ the operator had cancellation criteria,  they were  solely \nbased on getting\
  \ passengers on and off vessel s safely and not on the limitations of the \nvessel\
  \ s or the weather.  \n3.27 As there were  no set weather criteria, t he Commission\
  \ was unable to determine \nwhether weather criteria would have prevented the water\
  \ taxi  service operating . \nHowever, having weather criteria in place is an important\
  \ risk control.   \nRisk of capsize  \n3.28 The operator of  the Henerata  had not\
  \ assessed the risk of a capsize  occurring . As a \nresult  there were no documented\
  \ controls for preventing one occurring  or for \nminimising the consequences should\
  \ one  occur . A fulsome assessment would have \nlikely resulted in a review of\
  \ its operations to assess how best to prevent one from \noccurring . Similarly\
  \ , it would have aimed to minimise the consequences if one were to \noccur , such\
  \ as  through  the provision of a float -free EPIRB , handholds and emergency \n\
  procedures to assist skipper s in their actions and directions to passengers.  \n\
  3.29 There were limitations in the information available to the operator to assess\
  \ the \nvessel's capabilities and risk of capsizing . These are  further discussed\
  \ in 'Regulatory \nrequirements  for stability and buoyancy' . \nRegulatory requirements\
  \  for stability and buoyancy  \nSafety issue: Operators have insufficient stabilit\
  \ y information to make informed decisions , \nbecause there is no requirement for\
  \ small commercial craft to be provided with  stability data .  \n3.30 The Henerata\
  \ was designed  and built by  Osprey Boats /Alloyd Engineering (Osprey).  \nOsprey\
  \  had been producing collared ve ssels, known in New Zealand as pontoon boats,\
  \ \nfor more than  20 years. The design  is a deep vee hull surrounded by partitioned\
  \ alloy \nair chambers that provide additional buoyancy . The Henerata 's design\
  \ was based on a \nmodel first approved in 200 5. \n3.31 Maritime Rules Part 40A\
  \ prescribes the requirements for design, construction and \nequipment on New Zealand\
  \ passenger ships that are not subject to the requirements \nof the International\
  \ Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.  The 2005  design approval \nwas made\
  \ to cover a range of Osprey vessels from 6 to 8.5 metres in length. The \ndesign\
  \ approval described an 'aluminium monohull sportsfisher/cabin cruiser vessel \n\
  with enclosed accommodation forward and open deck aft '. The intended service and\
  \ \nFinal Report MO -2019 -204 \n<< Page 15 >>\n operating limits were to be finalised\
  \ between the owner and the surveyor based on  the \nfollowing : \n\u2022 restricted\
  \ coastal - limit to be determined by fuel capacity and location. Anticipate \n\
  six passengers  \n\u2022 inshore limits - depending upon stability for the length\
  \ of the vessel  \n\u2022 enclosed waters - as above  \n\u2022 limits are subject\
  \ to the carriage of sufficient [life -saving apparatus] and sufficient \nstability.\
  \  \n3.32 The Henerata  was constructed under survey  and assigned inshore and enclosed\
  \ waters \noperating limits. Maritime Rules Part 40 had been  updated since the\
  \ 2005 design \napproval . The c lassification of the Osprey vessels had changed\
  \ , so that u nder the \nrevised rule the Osprey was considered to be a well -decked22\
  \ vessel and treated as an \nopen boat23. This change in classification brought\
  \ the Osprey vessels that were longer  \nthan six metres  into a c ategory for which\
  \ the swamp test requirements were unclear . \nHowever, the Henerata  did undergo\
  \ swamp testing un der Maritime Rule s Part 40A .13 \n(Stability), 4. This section\
  \ of the rule  allowed for the use of an approved  swamp test or \ncalculation that\
  \ demonst rated that a boat, when fully swamped, had sufficient \nbuoyancy to stay\
  \ afloat and in good trim.  \n3.33 The Henerata 's stability assessment, as attached\
  \ to its origina l survey documents, was a \ncombination of a July 2009 swamp test\
  \ report for a 7.5 -metre Osprey and buoyancy \ncalculations for the 6.5 -metre\
  \ and eight -metre Osprey hulls. Both calculations showed \nthat the airtight volume\
  \ of the hull significantly exceeded the  weight of the hull and \ntherefore the\
  \ vessels were considered to be  very buoyant.  \n3.34 Although Maritime Rules Part\
  \ 40A does not state the reasoning behind the flotation \nand stability requirements,\
  \ the Australian National Standard for Commercial Vessels \ndescrib es the risk,\
  \ the risk controls and the performance requirements behind the \nflotation tests.\
  \ All vessels have a risk of capsizing that needs to be controlled. \nDepending\
  \ on a vessel's operation, size and flooding -risk category, scaled \nrequirements\
  \ are prescr ibed to prevent and control the likelihood of flooding and \ncapsize.\
  \ Two basic requirements are prescribed for a vessel such as the Henerata : \n\u2022\
  \ basic flotation , which has a primary function of keeping the vessel afloat in\
  \ the \nevent of swamping or capsize  \n\u2022 level flotation , which has primary\
  \ functions of keep ing the vessel afloat and \nupright in the event of swamping\
  \ and , in the event of capsize, afloat.  \n3.35 New Zealand legislation does not\
  \ require passenger v essel s under 15 metres in length  \nto have stability data\
  \ booklet s. The data contained in a stability booklet can help a \nvessel's crew\
  \ to estimate the vessel's stability and how  it could  be affected by changes \n\
  in opera ting conditions  or damage .  \n3.36 By meeting the requirements of the\
  \ swamp test and/or the swamp test calculation , the \nvessel is deemed to satisfy\
  \ all stability requirements  and no further stability \ninformation is required\
  \ . However, swamp tests are carried out i n calm wate rs and static \n \n22 The\
  \ vessel's deck is exposed to weather and sea, watertight against a head of 1.2\
  \ metres of sea water, and \nfitted with solid sides that would impede the drainage\
  \ of water over the side.  \n23 A boat not protected from the entry of water by\
  \ means of a complete deck or by a combination of deck, \nweathertight superstructure\
  \ and deckhouse.  \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2019 -204 conditions.\
  \ In reality , the conditions that are likely to overwhelm a vessel tend to \ninclude\
  \ strong dynamic forces from wind and seas.   \n3.37 The Henerata 's buoyancy was\
  \ proven by the fact that it remained afloat after capsizing. \nThe original design\
  \ approval required the vessel's stability to be taken into account for \ndetermining\
  \ its operating limits. Without conducting an inclining experiment24 required \n\
  for larger vessels, which is impractical for many small commercial vessels, there\
  \ wa s no \nway to assess the actual stability of the Henerata .  \n3.38 It is therefore\
  \ difficult for operators of small domestic commercial vessels to define \nsafe\
  \ operating li mits when they have no way of measuring the margin by which a \n\
  vessel may be approaching or exceeding the designed buoyancy and stability criteria.\
  \   \n3.39 On the one hand , operators are expected to assess vessels ' suitability\
  \ and limitations \nfor intended operatio ns. On the other hand , boat manufacturers\
  \ are not currently \nrequired to provide  stability information that would better\
  \ assist operator s in \ndetermin ing vessel s' operating parameters.  \n3.40 The\
  \ Maritime Rules Part 40 series is currently under revision . Therefore the Commission\
  \ \nhas issued a recommendation  to Maritime New Zealand that it  ensure future\
  \ Maritime \nRules require appropriate stability and buoyancy testing , with respect\
  \ to  a vessels area \nof operation , for domestic commercial passenger vessels\
  \ of a ll sizes and risk profiles , \nand consider introducing survivability measures\
  \ to assist survivors in the water after a \ncapsize event.  \n \n \n24 A procedure\
  \ used to determine a vessel's stability characteristics. Known weights are shifted\
  \ from the centr eline \nto measured distances to port and starboard and the resulting\
  \ angles of incline used to produce the vessel's \nown stability data.  \nFinal\
