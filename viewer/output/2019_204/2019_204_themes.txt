Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Insufficient consideration of weather conditions: The operator did not have defined weather criteria in their Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP), leading to the skipper making a critical safety decision without any criteria to assess it. This lack of consideration of weather conditions increased the likelihood of the accident occurring.
2. Lack of risk assessment for capsize: The operator did not assess the risk of a capsize occurring and did not have documented controls in place to prevent or minimize the consequences of a capsize. This lack of risk assessment and control measures contributed to the vessel being overwhelmed by steep and unpredictable seas.
3. Self-perceived pressure to operate: The absence of communication facilities at Freshwater Hut resulted in a self-perceived pressure on the skipper to pick up the passengers. This pressure may have influenced the skipper's decision to proceed with the water taxi service despite worsening weather conditions.
