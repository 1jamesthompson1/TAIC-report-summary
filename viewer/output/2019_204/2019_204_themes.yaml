- name: Weather Criteria and Decision Making
  explanation: Weather criteria are essential for making informed decisions about whether to operate a vessel safely. In the case of the Henerata, the absence of predefined weather criteria in the operator's Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP) meant that the skipper had to make a critical safety decision without any specific criteria to assess the weather conditions against. "The operator had not included predefined weather criteria in its MTOP" (3.26). This lack of criteria could lead to inconsistent decision-making and potentially unsafe operations, as skippers are left to rely solely on their own judgment without a standardized reference. "If the operator had developed and set predefined weather criteria, all the appropriate considerations in this incident would have been taken into account, resulting in a more consistent approach to deciding when to sail" (3.25).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  explanation: Risk assessment and management are crucial for preventing accidents and minimizing their consequences. The operator of the Henerata did not assess the risk of a capsize occurring, which meant there were no documented controls in place to prevent a capsize or to minimize the consequences should one occur. "The operator of the Henerata had not assessed the risk of a capsize occurring" (3.28). A thorough risk assessment could have led to a review of operations to prevent a capsize and to the implementation of measures such as a float-free EPIRB, handholds, and emergency procedures to assist skippers and passengers in an emergency.
- name: Stability and Buoyancy Information
  explanation: Stability and buoyancy information is vital for operators to understand the capabilities and limitations of their vessels, especially in adverse conditions. The Henerata's operator lacked sufficient stability information to make informed decisions, as there was no requirement for small commercial craft to be provided with stability data. "Operators have insufficient stability information to make informed decisions, because there is no requirement for small commercial craft to be provided with stability data" (3.29). Without this information, it is challenging to define safe operating limits and to measure the margin by which a vessel may be approaching or exceeding designed buoyancy and stability criteria.
- name: Communication Facilities and Perceived Pressure
  explanation: The availability of communication facilities can influence operational decisions, particularly in remote locations. The absence of communication facilities at Freshwater Hut meant that passenger pick-up services were rarely canceled, leading to a self-perceived pressure on the skipper to operate the service despite adverse conditions. "due to the absence of any communication facilities at freshwater hut, passenger pick-up services from freshwater hut were rarely canceled" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This pressure could compromise safety by pushing skippers to proceed with operations when it might be safer to delay or cancel.
- name: Safety Equipment Accessibility and Suitability
  explanation: The accessibility and suitability of safety equipment are critical in emergency situations. In the Henerata incident, the passengers were not wearing lifejackets at the time of the capsize, and the EPIRB was not activated because the skipper could not reach it. "At the time of the capsize the passengers were not wearing their lifejackets" (3.16), and "the skipper was unable to reach and activate it when the vessel capsized" (3.17). Ensuring that safety equipment is fit for purpose, readily accessible, and that passengers are aware of and use the equipment properly can significantly affect survival outcomes.
- name: Emergency Preparedness and Response
  explanation: Emergency preparedness and response are essential for ensuring the safety of passengers and crew during unexpected events. The Henerata's capsize highlighted the need for emergency procedures and the importance of re-examining risks when conditions change. "the skipper's decision to carry on should have prompted a re-examination of the risks to which the passengers were potentially exposed" (3.13). Proper emergency response includes providing safety instructions, mustering passengers, and making safety calls, which were not adequately addressed in this incident.
