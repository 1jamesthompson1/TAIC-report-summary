  \ determined th at an  aerodynamic stall  (stall)  occu rred during a  turn at low\
  \ \nlevel.  There was insufficient height above ground  to allow the pilot to recover\
  \ the aircraft , and \nthe left wing  tip struck  terrain shortly after it stalled.\
  \  \n4.1.2.  Three scenarios were considered as possible reasons for the aeroplane\
  \ havin g stalled:  \n\uF0B7 pilot incapacitation  \n\uF0B7 mechanical or engin\
  \ e failur e  \n\uF0B7 the pilot 's mishandling  of the a eroplane  during a low-level\
  \ manoeuvre .   \nThese scenarios are discussed below.  \n4.1.3.  Aircraft equipment\
  \  and the operator's procedures,  as well as  regulations and guidelines \naround\
  \ stock -clearing manoeuvres , are also discussed.  \n4.2. Pilot incapacitation\
  \  \n4.2.1.  The passengers , who had been with the pilot for more than  five hou\
  \ rs, recall ed that he had \nbeen  in good spirits and not showing any visible\
  \  signs of ill health .  The front passenger \nrecall ed that th e pilot was responsive\
  \ in the moments le ading up to the stall .  The GPS flight \npath  data show ed\
  \ that the aircraft was flown at a relatively constant height and that the rate\
  \ \nof turn was maintained until it increased shortly before the crash.   This,\
  \ along with the bent \nthrottle control lever,  suggest ed that th e pilot had\
  \ been  in control of the a eroplane . \n4.2.2.  The pilot had been assessed by\
  \ the CAA as having an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease \ndue to higher -than\
  \ -normal levels  of cholesterol and a history of smoking.  As a result he had \n\
  been subjected to regular cardiovascular stress test ing.  In spite of the perceived\
  \  elevated \nrisk, the stress testing had not indicated any functional abnormality.\
  \   In addition, the  post-\nmortem examination found  no pre -existing condition\
  \ that might  have incapacitated the pilot.  \n4.2.3.  The operator suggested that\
  \ the pilot may have been affected by a neurological condition \ncalled Transient\
  \ Global Amnesia (TGA), that could have resulted in a loss of contr ol.  \nAccording\
  \ to the CAA's medical manual29, TGA is a 'transient loss of memory' involving \n\
  complete or partial amnesia.  During a TGA episode there is 'no alteration to conciousness'\
  \ \nand there is 'preservation of immediate memory, personal identity, and cognition'.\
  \  There is \nalso a 'preservation of motor skills' and 'complex tasks are preserved,\
  \ such as the ability to \ndrive', which suggests that a loss of control would be\
  \ very unlikely due to TGA.  \n4.2.4.  The Commission's aviation medical consultant30\
  \ was asked to  assess the likelihood of an \nepisode of TGA having been a contributory\
  \ factor.  After reviewing the post -mortem \nexamination report and the pilots\
  \ medical history, he determined it was 'extremely unlikely' \nthat the pilot had\
  \ experienced TGA.   \n4.2.5.  A toxicologic al examination of the pilot found no\
  \ performance -impairing substances and the \ncarbon monoxide level in his blood\
  \ was in the normal range for a smoker.  It was therefore \nvery unlikely that the\
  \ pilot had been physically incapacitated before the stall.  \n                \

  \ report AO -2014 -004 4.3. Mechanical or engine failure  \nFlight controls and\
  \ fuel supply  \n4.3.1.  No evidence of a pre -existing  mechanical  failure was\
  \  found , and flight control continuity was \nconfirmed between  the cockpit controls\
  \ and the flight control surfaces .  The aircraft 's fuel \nsystem integrity was\
  \ confirmed , and the electric boost pump and fuel tank selector valve \nfunctioned\
  \ correctly.  Fuel was present in the lines from the selected tank  (the right main\
  \ ) to \nthe selector valve and to the engine.  A significant amount of fuel was\
  \ also draine d from  both  \nmain fuel tank s at the accident site.  \n4.3.2. \
  \ The aeroplane  departed  Queenstown with approximately 250 litres of fuel on board,\
  \ then flew \nto Ben Ohau and to Omarama , a total flight time of about two hours.\
  \  As the normal fuel \nconsumption was  about 60 litres an hour, approximately\
  \  120 litres of fuel would have been \nused by the time it landed at Omarama. \
  \ The pilot did not refuel at Omarama although fuel \nwas available there.  Therefore\
  \ there would have been an estimated  130 litres on departure, \nwhich was  sufficient\
  \ for the 60 minutes of  flight time to return to Queenstown via Poolburn .   \n\
  4.3.3.  The operator's  fuel management  procedures for the aeroplane  required\
  \  pilots  to writ e down \nthe fuel levels in the fuel tanks prior to each departure\
  \ .  Fuel quantity gauges in older \naeroplanes  are often  unreliable,  so pilots\
  \ measure d the fuel tank levels manually , using a \nwooden dipstick  to establish\
  \  the amount of fuel i n each tank.  Pilot s would then  write down \nthe fuel\
  \ quantities on their hand s as they 'dipped ' the tanks.   \n4.3.4.  The pilot\
  \ had the following numbers writte n on his left hand : 15-3-4-45.  The wooden dipstick\
  \ \ncannot measure  quantities as low as  three or four litres.  T herefore it is\
  \ likely  that the \nnumbers  in full  were  actually '15-3[0]-4[0]-45'.  This would\
  \ have meant  there was 15 litres in \nthe left tip tank, 30 litres in the left\
  \ main tank, 40 litres in the right main tank, and 45 litres in \nthe right tip\
  \ tank prior to departin g Omarama.  This gave  a total of 130 litres on board,\
  \ which \nis the same as was calculated  based on the  fuel load departing Queenstown\
  \ , the average fuel \nconsumption rate , and the total flight time.  \n4.3.5. \
  \ The fuel system allowed  only one tank to be selected at a time.  T he operator's\
  \ fuel \nmanagement procedures required pilot s to take off and land with the fullest\
  \ main tank \nselected, and to balance the fuel distribution every half hour by\
  \ changing tanks  as required .  \nThe pilot had a notebook in wh ich he record\
  \ ed the times when he switched tanks and \nreminders of when to chang e tanks .\
  \  There was a note on  the day of the flight that said \n\"change  right  main\
  \  @ 1455 \", which suggest ed he intended  to select the right main tank at \n\
  that time .   \n4.3.6.  If the pilot had followed the normal procedure , he would\
  \ have taken off from Omarama with \nthe right main tank  selected .  After take\
  \ -off he would have selected the right tip tank for half \nan hour to correct \
  \ the fuel imbalance, then selected th e fullest main tank prior t o landing.  \n\
  The aircraft departed Omarama at 1425, so the fuel distribution  would have been\
  \ nearly \nbalanced  by 1455 .  However , the pilot would have  started  descending\
  \ as  they approached  \nthe Poolburn airstrip about five minutes prior to this\
  \ , at 1450.  He would have turned the fuel \nboost pump on and changed to the fullest\
  \ main tank before he commenced his descent , as \nthis was  the standard operating\
  \ procedure  for the aircraft.   \n4.3.7.  At the time of the accident  the electric\
  \  boost pump was on and th e right main fue l tank was \nselected.  This was consistent\
  \ with the pilot having followed  the fuel management procedure \nand should  have\
  \ meant there was at least 30 litres of fuel in the right main tank , which  was\
  \ \nsupplying the engin e.  Therefore the pilot's management of t he fuel system\
  \  was considered to \nhave been in accordance with the operator's procedures and\
  \ was not a contributing factor.  \n \n \n \n \nFinal report AO -2014 -004 \n<<\
  \ Page 15 >>\n Engine and cockpit controls  \n4.3.8.  The engine , fuel control\
  \ unit  (see Appendix 1)  and ignition system were  inspected at a \nspecialist\
  \ engine overhaul facility  (see paragraph 3. 4.12).  No pre -existing  defects\
  \ were found \nthat would have caused a loss in power.  The propeller was inspected\
  \ at a specialist propelle r \noverhaul facility (see paragraph 3. 4.13).  No pre\
  \ -existing  defects were foun d, and it was \ndete rmined that the propeller had\
  \ been  under low power  when it struck the ground . \n4.3.9.  The engine throttle\
  \ lever was found in the idle position and bent sideways to the left .  The \npilot\
  \ had an injury to his right hand that indicat ed it was very likely that he had\
  \ been  holding  \nthe throttle when the a eroplane hit  the ground.  The throttle\
  \ could not be moved out of this \nposition after the accident, which  suggested\
  \ that the throttle was at idle prior to ground \nimpact .  The pre -impact i dle\
  \ position  support ed the conclusion from the propeller examination  \nthat the\
  \ propeller was at low power when it hit the ground .  One explanation for a low\
  \ power \nsetting  is that the pilot closed the throttle when he realised that a\
  \ crash  was imminent . \n4.3.10.  The mix ture lever that controlled the fuel-to-air\
  \ ratio  within the induction system was found in \na partially leaned pos ition\
  \ after the acci dent.  In order to maintain the same fuel-to-air ratio,  \nthe\
  \ amount of fuel supplied to an engine needs to be reduced as an a ircraft climbs,\
  \ due to \nthe reduction of air p ressure as  altitude  increases .  As a rule of\
  \ thumb, o perating at altitudes \nabove 3,000 feet  require s the mixture to be\
  \ leaned  by moving the lever rearward.  T he lever is \nreturned to the full forward\
  \ or rich position as part of the before -landing checklist during the \nfinal approach\
  \ to land.  The aeroplane had been flown to Poolburn at an altitude  of about \n\
  7,000 feet,  so this would have required the fuel mixture to be leaned.   \n4.3.11.\
  \  The aircraft was not fully config ured for landing and was not on the final approach\
  \ to land, so \nthe pilot ma y not have completed the before -landing checklist\
  \ and may not have returned the \nmixture lever to full forward position.  The lever\
  \ could also have been moved by one of the \noccupants  as they exited the aircraft\
  \ after the accident.  \n4.3.12.  Both passengers had been briefed by the pilot\
  \ on the normal changes in engine sound  to be \nexpected during the flight . Neither\
  \ passenger could recall any abnormal  or unexpected  engine \nsound s at any stage.\
  \  Had there been an engine failure following the stock -clearing pass, \nthere\
  \ were two alternate airstrips to the southw est of Poolburn airstrip  that could\
  \ have been \nused.  T he operator said the pilot was likely to have known of them\
  \ .  However, t he GPS flight \ntrack show ed that after the low pass the a eroplane\
  \ continu ed to turn, and increas ed in \naltitude and speed .  This  suggested\
  \ that  the engine was producing normal power during the \nturn.  \n4.4. The low\
  \ -level  mano euvre \n4.4.1.  Both passengers reca lled the pilot telling them\
  \ that during the flight he  might have to move \nstock from one or more of the\
  \ airstrips to en able them to land.  He said that this would \ninvolve  flying\
  \ at low level over the airstrip to sc are the stock off the landing area , and\
  \ that it \nmight require several passes at low level  with tight turns . \n4.4.2.\
  \  Two of the airstrips, Ben Ohau and Poolburn, were on farm s and accessible to\
  \ stock.  N either \npassenger could recall stock being on the Ben Ohau ai rstrip,\
  \ and the GPS flight path data \nshowed that the a eroplane  circled around the\
  \ airstrip  once  before landing .  This suggested  \nthat the pilot  assessed the\
  \ airstrip and  looked for any animals on  the landing area, but found \nnone. \
  \ The pilot had also called the farm  owner at Ben Ohau to check the condition of\
  \ the \nairstrip before departing Queenstown.  Finding  \n2. A mechanical or engine\
  \ failure  was highly unlikely to have been a \ncontribut ing factor . \n\n<< Page\
  \ 16 >>\n Final report AO -2014 -004 4.4.3.  According to the owner of the Poolburn\
  \ airstrip, no -one telephoned to ask about the condition \nof the airstrip, including\
  \ whether stock would be present, on 5 August 2014.   The front \npassenger recall\
  \ ed seeing cattle on the Poolburn airstrip and that the pilot attempted to clear\
  \ \nthe animals off the landing area by flying over them at low level.  He recalled\
  \  the pilot saying \nthat cows were stubborn .  The passenger said, \"We were banking\
  \ tightly while circling to \nchase the co ws away\" and that  \"it was making me\
  \ uncomfortable\", so he stopped looking \noutside the window.   He remember ed\
  \ looking outside again just before the accident and \nseeing the ground coming\
  \ towards them, that he warned the pilot , and that the pilot \"seemed \nsurprised\
  \ about that \". \n4.5. Flight path data  \n4.5.1.  The GPS flight path  data (se\
  \ e Figure s 1 and 6 ), recovered from the on-board  iPad, showed the \naeroplane\
  \  flying in a wide arc  around the airstrip before des cending and flying directly\
  \ above  \nthe airstrip at a height estimated at between 100  and 150 feet  AGL.\
  \  About halfway along the \nairstrip the aeroplane was turned to the left  through\
  \ approximately 180 degrees .  Its \ngroundspeed initially increased during the\
  \ turn , then decreased rapidly just before impact.  \n4.5.2.  The rate of turn31\
  \ was initially moderate, then a southerly direction  was maintained  for about\
  \ \n400 m before the aeroplane turned left in a tighter turn.  The turn radius \
  \ of the initial turn \naway from the airstrip approximated that  of a turn made\
  \ with 30 degr ees angle of bank in still \nwind (see F igure 6 , dashed red  line).\
  \  The smaller turn radius  during the last part of the turn \nwould have required\
  \ 45 to 60 degrees angle of bank.  \n \nFigure 6  \niPad GPS flight track data \

  \ >>\n 4.5.3.  Figure 6  shows the flight track  (in magenta) of th e aeroplane\
  \  as displayed  on the on-board  \niPad by an application  called AirNav ProTM.\
  \  Due to buffering of the GPS data, and i n order to \nshow a 'live' view of the\
  \ flight , the application had to pred ict the next position of the \naeroplane\
  \ .  This feature has resulted in an impossibl e track being depicted between the\
  \ \npoints at  89 knots  and 16  knots .  This part of the data is invalid, and\
  \ was most likely caused \nby the  software predict ing the position  shown at the\
  \ 60 knots  point  then 'filling in'  the track to \nthe final data point at 16\
  \ knots.  I n fact  the aeroplane stalled at about the 89 knots point and \nfollowed\
  \ a line between the 89 knots  point and the crash site . \n4.5.4.  The dashed red\
  \  line in Figure 6  represents the calculated  radius (380  m) of a turn carried\
  \ out \nin still air (no wind) with an entry airspeed of 90 knots and 30 degrees\
  \ angle of bank.  The \ndashed yellow  line at the bottom of the figure  represents\
  \ the expected flight track  of a turn \ncarried out in the wind conditions present\
  \ at the time (15 -20 knots  from the northwest ) and \nwith 30 degrees angle of\
  \ bank.  The rate of turn  is the same  for both , but with a tailwind more \nground\
  \ is covered during the turn.  This put the aircraft clos er to the higher  terrain\
  \ to th e \nsouth of the airstrip, and the pilot would have had to increase the\
  \ rate of turn or climb to \navoid it.  \n4.5.5.  The a eroplane 's altitude increased\
  \ slightly during the initial part of the turn,  from  2,866 feet \n(GPS altitude33)\
  \ to 2 ,912 feet.  During the fina l part of the turn it increased  to 2,955 feet\
  \ \nbefore rapidly decreasing to 2,760 feet, the altitude of the accident site .\
  \  The terrain \nsurrounding the airstrip consisted of rocky outcrops  and shallow\
  \  gullies , with lower  terrain to \nthe n orthwest  and a rocky ridge  about 170\
  \ feet higher,  800 m to the s outh east of the airstrip .  \nThe a eroplane 's\
  \ height above ground increased to about 200 feet during the initial part of the\
  \ \nturn, bu t prior to the final part of the  turn it decr eased to abo ut 100\
  \  feet due to the rising \nterrain ahead.  \n4.5.6.  When the front passenger recalled\
  \ seeing ground coming at them, he may have been \nreferring to the higher ground\
  \ on his side (to the r ight of the a eroplane ) that they were \napproaching  before\
  \ or during  the final part of the turn.  The pilot may not have seen the \nterrain\
  \ from his position on the  left-hand  side of the a eroplane  (which was in a left\
  \ turn) , or he \nmay have been looking back over his left shoulder to see if the\
  \ cows had moved off the \nairstrip.  Either way , according to the passenger in\
  \ the right -hand seat the pilot  had seemed  \nsurprised by  how close the aeroplane\
  \ was coming to the high terrain , and likely  attempted to \nincrease the rate\
  \ of turn by increasing the angle of bank.  \nThe stall  \n4.5.7.  The stall speed\
  \ of a PA32 -300 in level flight , in the same configuration and at the same \n\
  weight as the aeroplane  at the time of the accident, is  about 55 knots .  When\
  \ an a eroplane  is \nbanked in a turn there is an increase in the load ( weight\
  \ or G) factor, a nd the vertical \ncomponent of lift is reduced (see Appendix 3\
  \ ).  A stall will occur at a higher airspeed  in a turn \nthan when in  level flight\
  \ .  In a 30 -degree ang le of bank turn the stall speed is 1.1 times the \nstall\
  \ speed in level flight (61  knots ), at 45 degrees it is 1.2 (66  knots ), and\
  \ at 60 degrees it is \n1.4 (77  knots ).  The groundspeed recorded by the GPS unit\
  \ as the a eroplane  was partway \nthrough the final turn  was 89  knots  and reducing\
  \ as the rate of turn increased .  The re was a \ntailwind of 5-10 knots  at that\
  \  point, so the airspeed was probably closer to 80  knots  and \napproaching the\
  \ stall speed for a 60 -degree  angle of bank  turn (77  knots ). \n4.5.8.  The\
  \ front passenger recalled the a eroplane  \"banking sharply\"  to \"almost vertical\"\
  \ .  This was  \nlikely to have been eith er an increase in the angle of bank  by\
  \ the pilot to increase the rate of \nturn, or the left wing dropping when the a\
  \ eroplane  stalled.  When an a eroplane  stalls in a \nturn, the inside wing stalls\
  \ before the outside wing because it is travelling slower through the \nair.  As\
  \ a result the inside wing drops further and the aeroplane  rolls further into the\
  \ turn .  The \naeroplane  struck the ground in a left wing and nose low attitude\
  \ with a high vertical and low \nhorizontal speed .  The ground im pact evidence\
  \ support ed the conclusion that the a eroplane  \nstalled while  in a left turn\
  \ at low level.  The stall occurred when the a eroplane  was less than  \n     \
  \                                                   \n33 GPS altitude is the height\
  \  above sea level, referenced to the WGS84 geodetic datum .  GPS altitudes ca n\
  \ \nhave an error of up to +/ - 75 feet, however it is typically accurate to within\
  \ 20 feet.  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final report AO -2014 -004 150 feet above the ground,\
  \ much less than  the minimum 300-400 feet  or more  required to \nrecover the aircraft\
  \ from a stall.  \nOther factors  \n4.5.9.  Having an  artificial horizon  installed\
  \ in an aeroplane  can assist  a pilot in judging the ir angle of \nbank during\
  \ a turn, especially when  at low level over  undulating terrain.  However,  there\
  \ was \nno requirement for one  to be fitted for this type of operation, and the\
  \ pilot was experienced  \nwith flying in mountainous terrain.  The a eroplane \
  \ was fitted with a turn and slip  indicator  that \ngave a basic indication of\
  \ the rate of turn . \n4.5.10.  The lack of an aura l stall warning may have been\
  \ a factor that prevented the pilot recognising \nan impending  stall and taking\
  \ action to avoid it.  The stall warning light was operable, but i f \nthe pilot\
  \ had been looking out the side window in the direction of the turn he may not have\
  \ \nnoticed the light  illuminate .  A warning horn could ha ve immediately  drawn\
  \ his attention to \nthe impending stall.  Later-model PA32 -300 aeroplanes  were\
  \ fitted with a stall warning horn \nas well as the light.  \n4.5.11.  The outer\
  \ scale of the airspeed indicator  (see Figure 8) was calibrated in  mph, while\
  \ the \nsmaller inner scale was in knots .  One knot is equal to about 1.15  mph\
  \ .  The airspeed \nindicators in the other a eroplanes  the pilot regularly flew\
  \ were calibrated in knots  only.  \nAccording to the pilot's training records ,\
  \ he had  used knots when learning the airspeed \nlimitations for th e PA32 -300\
  \ type rating .  The pilot could have read the airspeed off the outer \nscale (mph)\
  \ thinking it was in knots, and thought they were flying faster than they actually\
  \ \nwere.   An airspeed of 90 mph on the outer scale would equate to about 77 knots\
  \ (the stall \nspeed at 60 degrees angle of bank) . \n \nFigure 7 \nAirspeed indicator\
  \ and stall warning light  (upper left)  \n4.5.12.  The aeroplane  had a high ground\
  \ speed34 during the majority of the turn due to the tailwind .  \nThis could have\
  \ been interpreted as a high airspeed  by the pilot  if he was looking outside the\
  \ \ncockpit and saw the ground  rushing past.  This illusion is exaggerated at low\
  \ heights above \nground , and  if a pilot reduces power to decrease the high ground\
  \ speed, the  airspeed \n                                                      \
  \  \n34 Groundspeed is the speed that the aircraft flies over the ground and is\
  \ affected by wind.  For example, if \nan aircraft flies at an indicated airspeed\
  \ of 100 knots i nto a headwind of 20 knots the groundspeed will be \n80 knots,\
  \ if it is a 20 knot tailwind the groundspeed will be 120 knots.  \n \n\n \nFinal\
  \ report AO -2014 -004 \n<< Page 19 >>\n decrease s.  The speed margin above the\
  \ stall speed is also decreased because the aeroplane \nis turning  (see Appendix\
  \ 3) .  \n4.5.13.  Although it could not be determined whether these factors  contributed\
  \ directly to the \naccident,  they would have made it harder for the pilot to recognise\
  \ the dangerous situation \nthat was developing.   \n \n \nFinding  \n3. The aeroplane\
  \  stalled  in a turn performed at low level during a stock -clearing \nmanoeuvre\
  \ . \nThe operator's s tock clearing procedures  \n4.5.14.  When flying into a farm\
  \ or remote airstrip , it may sometimes be necessary to clear stock from \nthe strip\
  \ before a landing  can be made.   Usually  the pilot will fly along the airstrip\
  \ at low level \nto scare the  stock to one  side.  After flying along the airstrip\
  \ , the standard practice is to climb  \nstraight ahead  to at least 500 feet AGL\
  \ before turning  and re -circuiting for the landing .  \n4.5.15.  In this case\
  \ the pilot  flew along the airstrip at low level , but instead of climbing straight\
  \ ahead \nto 50 0 feet he maintained his height as he entered the left turn.   The\
  \ front passenger recalled \nbeing told by the pilot that they would have to circle\
  \ back to scare the cattle again.   \n4.5.16.  The operator did not have any written\
  \ procedure s for or guidelines on how to carry out stock \nclearing .  However,\
  \ the Chief Pilot said that he had told his pilots that a low pass to scare \nstock\
  \ should be done to one side of the airstrip, followed by a straight climb to 500\
  \ feet \nabove the airstrip before turning.   He said that if stock did not move\
  \ after one low-level pass, \npilots should not make further attempts.  \n4.5.17.\
  \  Other  pilots of the operator  had different views  on how stock clearing should\
  \ be carried out.  \nNone of the pilots had been given flight instruction on t he\
  \ manoeuvre, nor had they been \nassessed for their competency in carrying it out.\
  \  They offered a range of minimum heights for \nthe manoeuvre, from 50 feet to\
  \ 150 feet  AGL.  They also had different  views on whether it \nwas necessary to\
  \ climb straight ahead to 500 feet after the pass before turning.  \n4.5.18.  In\
  \ this case t he pilot had indicated that he would perform a second pass, and his\
  \ low -level \nturn was consistent with that intention.   According to his logbook\
  \  he had performed multiple \npass es to clear stock at Poolburn and at other airstrips\
  \  before .  This, and the different views \nof the operator's  pilots, showed that\
  \ the Chief Pilot's verbal  instructions about stock clearing \nwere either unclear\
  \  or being ignored.  \n4.5.19.  Most  of the operator's pilots  said that the circuit35\
  \ direction at Poolburn was always to the \nleft, which would take an aircraft towards\
  \ the hi gher terrain when  approaching from the north .  \nIn this case , with\
  \  a strong crosswind from right to left , it would have been safer to turn  right\
  \  \ninto the wind , because  the terrain sloped do wn from the airstrip  and it\
  \ would have resulted in \na lower groundspeed .  It was not possible to determine\
  \ whether the pilot had carried out \nstock clearing  in similar wind conditions\
  \ , or if he had flown in a different circuit direction, \nduring previous flights\
  \ into Poolburn.  \n4.5.20.  Alternatively, the pilot could have climb ed straight\
  \ ahead to 500 feet  AGL before turning .  Had \nthere been an engine failure during\
  \ the low -level turn  to the left , there would have been  few \noptions for a\
  \  safe landing  because  of the rocky terrain  and high groundspeed of the \naeroplane\
  \ .  \n                                                        \n35 The circuit\
  \ is a rectangular path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing, while maintaining\
  \ visual \ncontact with the airf ield. \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final report AO -2014\
  \ -004 Finding  \n4. The operator  believed that stock clearing was permitted, but\
  \  had no written \nguidelines and had not  given its pilots  flight training  in\
  \ the manoeuvre.  \n4.6. Civil Aviation Rule s \n4.6.1.  CAR did not define or ref\
  \ er to stock clearing, nor was it  covered anywhere in the advisory \ncirculars\
  \  or guidelines  published by the CAA .  The commercial pilot licence training\
  \ syllabus \ndid not include stock -clearing techniques.  The agricultural rating\
  \ syllabus36 likewise  did not \ninclude a requirement for stock -clearing training.\
  \   \n4.6.2.  CAR Part 91.127 states that no person may operate an aircraft at an\
  \ aerodrome unless the \nrunway is clear of all persons, animals, vehicles, or other\
  \ obstructions during landing or take -\noff.  It does not specifically prohibit\
  \ a pilot from carrying out a low approach and overshoot to \nclear animals off\
  \ the runway.  \n4.6.3.  In accordance with CAR Parts 91 and 135 , the minimum height\
  \ for visual flight rules (VFR) air \ntransport flights is 500 fe et above the surface,\
  \ or 500 feet above any obstacle within a 150 \nm radius of the aircraft .  Aircraft\
  \ must also not be operated at a height less than required to \nsafely execute an\
  \ emergency landing in the eve nt of an engine failure.   These  requirement s \n\
  do not apply to the pilot in command of an aircraft conducting a take -off or landing,\
  \ a balked \nlanding or discontinued approach, or taxiing.  There is no definition\
  \ in CAR Part 1 for balked \nlanding or discontinu ed approach .   \n4.6.4.  A low\
  \ approach and overshoot involves an aircraft carrying out a normal approach to\
  \ land, but \nit stops descending at low level before climbing straight ahead to\
  \ 500 feet or more to circuit \nfor landing or to depart the area.   On occasions\
  \  there may be good reason  to fly at low level \nalong a runway or airstrip for\
  \ a short distance before climbing away.  This manoeuvre is \ntypically carried\
  \ out to inspect an unprepared landing area for any hazards , prior to landing.\
  \  \n4.6.5.  An article published in th e CAA safety magazine Vector in March 2012\
  \ , following  a low flying \nincident , discussed  low approach and overshoot manoeuvre\
  \ s.  The pilot involved  in the \nincident was quoted as  saying , \"A low pass\
  \ down the runway was accepted common practice \nas part of a go -around [low approach\
  \ and overshoot]\" and that \"the rules didn't prohibit the \nmanoeuvre\".  The\
  \ published response from the CAA at the time was \"just because the rules \nare\
  \ silent on the matter doesn't make it an acceptable practice\".  \n4.6.6.  The\
  \ pilot of the accident aeroplane  carried out a modified  low approach and overshoot\
  \ , and \ninstead of climbing out straight ahead after flying along the airstrip\
  \ he turned at low level  in \norder  to make another low -level pass over the airstrip.\
  \  In the absence of any specific \nguidelines from the operator or within the civil\
  \ aviation system regarding stock clearing, the \npilot carried out what he  may\
  \ have  thought was an acceptable manoeuvre for stock clearing.  \nEntries  in the\
  \ pilot's logbook , and the briefing he gave to t he passengers about making  \"\
  close \npasses\" and \"tight turns to get ba ck around\" , suggest ed this may have\
  \ been his  usual \ntechnique for  clear ing livestock that had not move d after\
  \ the first pass . \n4.6.7.  The CAA w as asked  by the Commission  to clarify the\
  \ requirements for operators who carry out \nstock clearing duri ng commercial or\
  \ air transport operations.  Th e CAA responded by saying \nthat stock clearance\
  \ is not authorised under CAR Part 13 5.  The reason  the CAA gave was  \nthat CAR\
  \ Part 91 , which applie s to all pilots  under all CAR, state s that pilots must\
  \ ensure a \nrunway is clear of animals during landing.  \n4.6.8.  CAR Part 91 states\
  \  that a pilot is allowed to fly below 500 feet AGL for the purposes of taking\
  \ \noff or la nding, and for carrying out a balked landing or discontinued approach.\
  \  As stock \nclearing could be interpreted as being a  form of balked landing or\
  \ discontinued approach, \n                                                    \
  \    \n36 The agricultural rating training syllabus was reviewed, as it was considered\
  \ by the investigation to be the \nmost likely place to find any guidelines about\
  \ stock -clearing procedures.   \n \nFinal report AO -2014 -004 \n<< Page 21 >>\n\
  \ and in the absence of any clear guidance from the CAA, the stock -clearing procedure\
  \ could be \ninterpreted as  being allowed.  \n4.6.9.  This operator and others\
  \ had been carrying out stock -clearing manoeuvres  for many years,  \npossibly\
  \  in the belief that it was not prohibited under CAR.  The CAA 's view that  stock\
  \ clear ing \nis not pe rmitted on an air transport flight may  not be shared by\
  \ all aviation industry  \nparticipants .  Therefore the Commission is recommending\
  \  that the Director of Civil Aviation \nprovide appropriate guidance to the aviation\
  \ industry on stock clearing.   \nFinding  \n5. There w as a lack of c larity on\
  \ whether  stock clearing  was a permissible activity \nunder the Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules . \n\n<< Page 22 >>"
