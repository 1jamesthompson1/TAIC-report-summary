  \ and around safety -critical components such as flight \ncontrol systems are a\
  \ threat to the safe operation of the aircraft.  Loose articles can move \ninside\
  \ an aircra ft and become trapped under moving components, such as control cables\
  \ and \nlevers.  These foreign objects can disrupt the normal operation of aircraft\
  \ systems and \ndamage system components, which could fail at a later stage.  \n\
  4.2. In this case the rag had become t rapped on the cable drum, resulting in damage\
  \ to the cable, \nthe cable drum guides and the pulleys through which the cable\
  \ passed between the forward \nand aft cable drums.  Whilst considered unlikely,\
  \ there was the potential for the stabiliser trim \nsystem ma nual control to become\
  \ jammed or at worst disabled if a cable severed.  However, \nthe electric side\
  \ of the stabiliser trim system control, consisting of an electric motor actuator\
  \ \nthat moved the stabiliser directly through a gearbox and clutch, would have\
  \ s till operated \nthrough independent electric switches on the pilots' control\
  \ column8 (wheel).  As a result, \nthere would have been no feedback through the\
  \ manual control cable to move the trim \nindicator9 during the operation of the\
  \ electric system, although t he pilot would have retained \ncontrol.  \n4.3. Three\
  \ ways in which a rag could end up in the electronics and equipment compartment\
  \ were \nconsidered:  \n\uF0B7 it had been there since aircraft manufacture  \n\uF0B7\
  \ it had been carried into the compartment by an engineer conducting rout ine inspection\
  \ \nand maintenance  \n\uF0B7 it had migrated into the compartment from the flight\
  \ deck (through gaps behind the \nrudder pedals) after being left there.  \n4.4.\
  \ The Boeing manufacturing process involves numerous inspections and quality -control\
  \ \nprocesses that would  normally prevent the aeroplane being delivered with a\
  \ rag left in a \ncompartment where safety -critical systems were located.  The\
  \ operator also conducted its own \nacceptance and pre -service inspections after\
  \ delivery from the manufacturer.  The cloth was \nnot of the same size or type\
  \ used by Boeing during its manufacture process.  For these \nreasons, it is unlikely\
  \ that the rag had been left in the compartment during manufacture.  \n4.5. The\
  \ Commission obtained samples of all the rag types in use at the three schedule\
  \ d-\nmaintenance facilities where the aircraft had been serviced.  A comparison\
  \ of each type was \nmade with the rag found trapped on the cable drum.  The rags\
  \ used at Melbourne and \nAuckland came from recycled clothing and bed sheets cut\
  \ up into smaller pieces for use.  The \nSydney maintenance facility used commercially\
  \ available, disposable paper -type wipes that \ncame either on a roll or as pre\
  \ -cut square pieces in a box dispenser.  Five different types of \ncleaning rag\
  \ were in use at Sydney.  One of them was a 30 0-millimetre -wide roll with tear\
  \ -off \nperforations every 340 millimetres, which closely matched the size and\
  \ texture of the cloth \nfound on the forward cable drum. Rag samples were not sought\
  \ from commercial cleaning \ncompanies that cleaned the interior of th e aircraft\
  \ at airport terminals, due to the fact that \nthey were not allowed to enter the\
  \ flight deck or electronics and equipment compartment.  \n4.6. A sample (see Figure\
  \ 5) from this roll and the incident rag were sent to the New Zealand Wool \nTesting\
  \ Authority f or comparison.  The fibre content was assessed using chemical dissolution\
  \ \ntests.  The test report10 showed that both samples were made from a cellulosic\
  \ or paper -\nbased fibre and polypropylene. The frequency and position of the needling\
  \ marks made during \nmanufacture were compared and the samples matched.  The test\
  \ report concluded that it was \n\"very likely that the two cloths [rags] are the\
  \ same\" and that \"the crease pattern in the cloth \n[rag] is consistent with the\
  \ cloth [rag] having been caught and dragged\".    \n                          \
  \                                 \n8 A control  column is used by the pilot in\
  \ conjunction with other controls to change direction and altitude.  \n9 The indicator\
  \ is located in the flight deck, and shows the pilot the position of the horizontal\
  \ stabiliser.  \n10 New Zealand Wool Testing Authority  report No. 13/584B.  \n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report AO-2013 -007 4.7. The findings of the New Zealand\
  \ Wool Testing Authority and the fact that the Sydney \nmaintenance facility was\
  \ the only one where that type of rag was used, make it highly likely \nthat the\
  \ rag found trapped on the forward cable drum originated from the Syd ney hangar.\
  \  \n4.8. The aircraft maintenance history was reviewed to establish when the rag\
  \ had been trapped on \nthe forward cable drum.  However, this was not possible\
  \ to determine, and no significant \nmaintenance had been performed on the stabiliser\
  \ trim system pr ior to the occurrence.  \n4.9. There are a number of maintenance\
  \ and cleaning tasks carried out in the flight deck area and \nin the electronics\
  \ and equipment compartment.  It was not possible to determine when a rag \nmay\
  \ have been introduced into either the flight d eck or the electronics and equipment\
  \ \ncompartment, because the use of rags was not required to be controlled or recorded.\
  \  \n4.10.  Several aircraft system components and control units are located in\
  \ the electronics and \nequipment compartment.  Consequently there are many tasks\
  \ carried out during routine \naircraft servicing and maintenance that require engineers\
  \ to enter the compartment and work \nin the area around the stabiliser trim cable\
  \ forward drum.  It is possible that an engineer \ncarried a rag on them while workin\
  \ g near the trim cables, which was either left behind or \ndropped and later became\
  \ drawn onto the forward cable drum and under the cable windings.  \n4.11.  The\
  \ type of rag involved was used for internal cleaning and made from a lint -free\
  \ material, \nwhich meant one of its main purposes was cleaning the inside of the\
  \ flight deck windscreens.  \nThe windscreen cleaning was normally done as required\
  \ by maintenance engineers, and it was \nnot normally recorded when this task was\
  \ carried out.  It was possible for a rag used for \nwindscreen cleaning to be dropped\
  \ on the floor near the rudder pedals, which could have \nmigrated through the gaps\
  \ behind the rudder pedals and down into the electronics and \nequipment compartment\
  \ below, and drawn under the cable windings of the forward drum . \n4.12.  This\
  \ incident, and the one that caused the landing gear retraction problems on the\
  \ B737 -838 \ndeparting Melbourne, highlight the importance of good housekeeping\
  \ during maintenance \noperations.  In both cases a rag left inside the aircraft\
  \ caused a safety is sue with a system that \nwas critical for flight.   \n4.13.\
  \  A final inspection after all work has been completed and before the aeroplane\
  \ is returned to \nservice is generally accepted best aeronautical engineering practice\
  \ for ensuring that nothing \nhas been left behi nd that could affect the integrity\
  \ of critical aircraft systems.  The addition of \na recorded inspection at the\
  \ end of each work task or maintenance hangar visit helps to \nensure that this\
  \ foreign object check is done thoroughly every time certain critical a reas have\
  \ \nbeen accessed.  Despite these measures being in place at the maintenance facilities,\
  \ rags \nwere left in the aircraft.  \n4.14.  These incidents reinforce the need\
  \ for thoroughness when carrying out these inspections at \nthe completion of maintenance.\
  \  Proced ures developed to prevent foreign objects being left \nbehind after maintenance\
  \ must be adhered to in order to avoid similar incidents occurring in \nthe future.\
  \  \nFindings:  \n1. The integrity of the aeroplane's stabiliser trim system manual\
  \ control was  \ncompromised by a rag that became trapped under a control cable\
  \ that was wound \nonto the forward cable drum of the stabiliser trim system.  \n\
  2. It was highly likely that the rag ended up in the aeroplane's electronics and\
  \ \nequipment compartment following cleaning, inspection,  or maintenance conducted\
  \ \nat the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility.  \n \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -007\n\
