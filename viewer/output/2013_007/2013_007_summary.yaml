- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 80
  explanation: The incident was caused by a rag that became trapped under a control cable, which is indicative of human error during maintenance ("The integrity of the aeroplane's stabiliser trim system manual control was compromised by a rag that became trapped under a control cable" (5.1)). The rag was likely introduced during cleaning, inspection, or maintenance at the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility ("it was highly likely that the rag ended up in the aeroplane's electronics and equipment compartment following cleaning, inspection, or maintenance conducted at the qantas sydney maintenance facility" (5.2 (invalid formatted quote))). This suggests a failure to adhere to procedures designed to prevent such occurrences, which can be attributed to human error and assumptions.
- name: Training and Competency

The failure to remove the rag indicates a lapse in following these safety procedures.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The presence of a rag in a critical area suggests that there may have been shortcomings in the organizational safety culture, as it indicates a lack of thoroughness and possibly a complacent attitude towards the potential consequences of leaving foreign objects in safety-critical areas ("Despite these measures being in place at the maintenance facilities, rags were left in the aircraft" (4.13)).
