The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domesti cally and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At 2230 on Friday 8 August 2014, a worksite was established between D alefield and 
Featherston on the Wairarapa Line to enable rail sleepers to be replaced on two rail bridges.  
Work was scheduled for the whole weekend, with the line to re -open at 0300 on Monday 11 
August 2014.  
1.2. Protection for the work area was achieved by tr ain control issuing a track warrant to the rail 
protection officer, the person responsible for the safety and protection of person nel at the 
worksite .  Trains were not scheduled, and not permitted to travel , through the worksite  for the 
period  to which the track warrant applied.  
1.3. The rail protection officer did not remain at the site for the entire period.  He travelled between 
his home in Wellington and the worksite  several times throughout the weekend.  He was not 
on site at 0300 on Monday  11 August  when the track warrant was due to be cancelled.  
Instead he had instructed the leading hand for each of the work groups at the two bridges to 
phone him and report when their work group had completed the work and was clear of the 
track.  
1.4. The rail protection officer received the all -clear from one of the leading hands , but the other 
work group had not completed the work.  He was unable to make contact with the other 
leading hand, so he assumed they were clear of the track and cancelled the track war rant with 
train control . 
1.5. Train control then issued a track warrant for an empty passenger train to pass through the 
area.  The driver of the train notice d the flashing light of a hi -rail excavator working on the rail 
bridge ahead and stopped his train abou t 180 metres short of the hi -rail excavator and the 
work group that was occupying the track.  There was no collision and nobody was injured.  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that a near collision 
between the train and the hi-rail excavator  occurred because the rail protection officer 
informed train control that the worksite  was clear without first checking  positively  that it was.  
1.7. The Commission found  that the KiwiRail process for planning and authorising the worksite  was 
not entirely followed and that this contributed to the incident.   The planning process did not 
address how rail activities within and through the protected work area would be controlled 
during the 52.5 -hour work period.   
1.8. The Commission also found  that it was likely that the rail protection officer was affected by an 
underlying level of fatigue and sleep inertia when he made the incorrect assumption that the 
work had been completed and that the track was safe for trains to pass over.  K iwiRail was not 
effectively managing the rail protection officer's day -to-day workload . 
1.9. The Commission recommended  that KiwiRail review the company's Fitness for Work Policy to 
ensure that the workload s of personnel undertaking safety -critical work, includ ing staff not on 
a roster, are managed effectively and that the risk of staff  suffering from the effects of fatigue 
is mitigated . 
1.10.  Key lessons  arising from this inquiry are:  
 not following standard railway operating procedures that are designed to provide fo r safe 
railway operations is highly likely to result in an accident  
 decisions that can affect the safety of railway workers should never be based entirely on 
assumptions, as in this case when clearance was given for trains to pass through the area 
when wor kers were still occupying the track.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The incident occurred at a planned work area between Featherston and Dalefield on the 
Wairarapa Line at about 0319 on Monday 11 August 2014.  The NZ Transport Agency notified 
the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) at 0730 that morning.  The 
Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) b of the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990 to determine the circums tances and causes of the occurrence and 
appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. Commission investigators conducted an interview with the rail protection officer2 for the 
planned work area later that morning before travell ing to the work area  to conduct a sit e 
examination.   
2.3. The two -person train crew were interviewed separately by the Commission investigators in 
Masterton the following day.    
2.4. On 13 August 2014 the Commission investigators interview ed separately  members of  KiwiRail 
Holdings Limited's ( KiwiRail's ) work group who had been on site at the time of the incident.  
2.5. KiwiRail's Central Regional Production and Planning Manager and the driver of the hi-rail 
excavator3 working on site under KiwiRail's supervision were interviewed separately on  
18 A ugust 2014.   
2.6. The Commission obtained the following records and documents for analysis:  
 the application for planned work  
 KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules  
 witness statements  
 the download ed data from the train's event recorder  
 the train controller's voice recording  
 the train control diagram  
 the track warrant4 issued by the train control ler to the rail protection officer  for the planned 
work  
 the track warrant issued to the driver of the repositioning passenger train  
 the training records for the rail protecti on officer  
 drug and alcohol testing results for KiwiRail staff at the accident site  
 the rail protection officer's cell phone records .  
2.7. The Commission engaged Associate Professor  Leigh  Signal  of the Sleep /Wake Research 
Centre at Massey University to review the rail protection officer's workload  and the opportunity 
he had for restorative sleep .   
2.8. On 29 March 2017  the Commission approved the d raft report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.9. The Commission received comments from four interested persons.  Any changes made 
resulting from those submissions have been included in this final report.  
2.10.  On 28 June 2017  the Commission approved this final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background information   
3.1.1.  KiwiRail owns, maintains and manages  the occupancy of , and the movement of trains and hi -
rail vehicles over , most of the New Zealand rail network.  KiwiRail Network Authorities5 
prepare and issue daily information bulletins6 that include planned track and bridge 
maintenance work carried out under the KiwiRail Track Safety Rules.  
3.1.2.  On Tuesday 29 July 2014, an  Application for Planned Work ( Form 1, see Appendix 1) was 
submitted to KiwiRail Network Authorities for approval.  The application was to establish a 
planned work area between t he north end station limits at Featherston and the Dalefield 
Intermediate Board , on the Wairarapa Line , from 2230 on Friday 8 August 2014 to 0300 on 
Monday 11 August 2014.  
3.1.3.  The planned work was bridge sleeper replacement work on Bridge s 49 and 52.  The 
application requested that the work area be protected by train control issuing a track warrant 
to a rail protection officer.  The application requested that the planned work area be classified 
as 'line impassable7' throughout the work period.  
3.1.4.  When a work are a exceeds one kilometre in length KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 901, Job 
Planning, requires that a work area communication plan (Form 2) be submitted with the 
application , specifying how the rail protection officer intends to  communicate with protected 
personnel and drivers of hi -rail vehicles .  Although the application showed that both a work 
area communication plan and a signal s and interlocking diagram  were  attached to  the 
application , these supporting documents were not  submitted .   
3.1.5.  'Rail protection officer ' is a gene ric term given to the person r esponsible for protecting 
individuals or multiple worksites depending on the level of competency held.  That person has 
overall responsibility for communicating with train control  and co-ordinating the movement of 
trains and hi -rail vehicles through and within the work area.  In this case, all scheduled trains 
were  cancelled while  the planned work was in progress.      
3.1.6.  The application was approved by KiwiRail Network Authorities  without the complete 
documentation being submitted . The information bulletins were  distributed to all the depots 
where staff  might be  affected by the planned work (see Appendix 2 , information bulletin dated 
8 August 2014 , issued at 1458 the previous day ).  The information bulletin showed that the 
planned work area was protected under KiwiRail's Operating Rule 401 (d) .  The rule allowed 
the train controller to issue a track warrant to the rail protection officer for work on the 
mainline without other protect ion.   
3.1.7.  The information bulletin showed the limits of the protected work area as Featherston and 
Dalefield, identified the name and contact details of the rail protection officer, and described 
the sleeper replacement work  activity on Bridge 49 and Bridge 52 as multiple activities, Kiwi 
Rail Track Safety Rule 910 .  Overgrowth removal work was proposed within the same 
protected work area , but that work did not get underway because of adverse weather 
conditions.   
 
                                                        
5 KiwiRail Network Authorities prepare and issue information bulletins that includ e planned track work 
carried under track and time permits, compulsory stop protection or track warrants.  An information bulletin 
can also include additional passenger train arrangements, special instructions for the day of operation and 
work trains .   
6 An information bulletin is an unnumbered instruction issued by KiwiRail Network Authorities in Wellington, 
usually the day before it comes into effect.  The information bulletin is distributed to all operating staff who 
may be affected, including train driv ers, passenger staff and infrastructure maintenance staff.    
7 'Line impassable ' is a term used when planned work requires the closing of a track to normal train 
movements for a period of time to allow that work to be carried out.  Train control may vary the hours of work 
when the planned work starts or has finished before the stated time.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 3.2. The occurrence  
3.2.1.  On Fr iday 8 August 2014, the rail protection officer worked from  his Wellington office between 
0700 and 1400  then  drove home .  He left home at about 2000 and reached Featherston  by 
about 2030 .   
3.2.2.  The train controller issued Track Warrant 88  to the rail protection officer  authorising a track 
occupation  between Featherston and Dalefield until 0300 on Monday 11 August  2014 (see 
Appendix 3) .  The mainline had been reported clear at 2153.  The radio call signs of seven hi -
rail vehicles were listed on the track warrant , which had authority to operate within the 
protected work area under instruction from the rail protection officer.   
3.2.3.  The rail protection officer 's read back of the track warrant to the train controller was confirmed 
correct  at 2155.  The train controller enquired  whether the rail protection officer  was going 
home in the morning and handing over the track warrant to someone else.  His response  was,  
"I would hold the track warrant through to the finish .  There will be new groups 
coming  on site at each bridge at six tomorrow morning and finishing at six 
tomorrow evening when they would be replaced by the crews working tonight, so 
the work will be continuous.  I am more or less holding on to the permit until it is 
finished on Monday morni ng."   
3.2.4.  At 2214 the rail protection officer made a cell phone call to the structures field engineer who 
was at Bridge 52  to confirm the details of Track Warrant 88.  The structures field engineer 
then held a pre -shift safety briefing with the 12 -person work group before the sleeper 
replacement work started .   
3.2.5.  The rail protection officer drove from Featherston Station to Bridge 49 (see Figure 1) after he 
completed his cell phone call with the structures field engineer .  The track warrant  was shown  
to the leading hand  before he gave  a pre-shift safety briefing  to all personnel on  site.

<< Page 5 >>
 3.2.6.  Earlier that day t he Meteorological  Service had issued a snowfall warning , forecasting that 
snow was likely to occur later that night on State Highway 2 between Featherston and Upper 
Hutt.  Drivers were warned to take extra care in the  winter driving conditions.  Mindful of that 
warning, the rail protection officer l eft the worksite soon after he finish ed the safety briefing .  
He experienced snow fall near the summit of the Rimut aka Hill Road on his drive home.   
3.2.7.  After arriving home, he copied  Track Warrant 88 and 'texted'  the occupation authority  to 14 
addressees at 2337.  He went to bed at 0115 and woke at about 0530.  
3.2.8.  A changeover of personnel at Bridge 49 and Bridge 52  took place at 0600 .  The rail protection 
officer phoned the incomin g leading hand at Bridge 49 at 0642 to discuss the progress made 
during the night shift.  He advised the leading hand that he could not drive to the bridge  that 
morning because t he road  remained  closed due to snowfall  overnight . He then had a similar  
conve rsation with the leading hand at Bridge 52.   
3.2.9.  At 0647 he sent a group text to 14 addressees confirming  that State Highway 2, Rimutaka Hill 
Road was closed because of the snowfall overnight.  He then drove to his Wellington office 
and carried out general  administrative work , return ing home at about 1100.  
3.2.10.  The road controlling authority had re-opened Rimutaka Hill Road  at 0953 , so t he rail 
protection officer then drove from home to Bridge 52 , arriv ing at about 1300.  He carried out a 
safety audit on the wor k group before review ing their work progress with the leading hand.  He 
then drove to the other worksite at Bridge 49 where he audited the Job Plan8 book and 
discussed work progress with the on -site leading hand.  He left the worksite at about 1500 to 
retur n home.   
3.2.11.  A scheduled shift hand -over took place at both worksites at 1800  and at 0600 the following  
day. 
3.2.12.  The rail protection officer reported that he slept for about nine hours on Saturday night before 
he woke  at 05 30.  He attempted to communicate with the leading hand at Bridge 49 at 0823 , 
but the cell phone was not answered .   
3.2.13.  After lunch he drove  to the Bridge 49 worksite and then on to Bridge 52 .  Before he departed  
each  worksite he instructed the leading hand that during their next hand -over at 1800 , the 
incoming leading hand must be asked to phone him once  the track had been cleared and was 
safe for trains to pass over.   
3.2.14.  After arriving home , he made a cell phone call to the structures field engineer at Bridge 52.  
They discussed the work progress  and he was assured that the track would be cleared b efore 
the track warrant was due to be cancelled at 0300 the next day.  The rail protection officer 
then forwarded a progress update text message to 12 addressees at 1649.  
3.2.15.  He went to bed at 1900 and woke at about  0245, having had what he described as a 
disturbed sleep . 
3.2.16.  At 0248:28 he m ade a cell phone call to the leading hand working at Bridge 49. The leading 
hand did not answer the call, so he left a voicemail message  and followed up with a text 
message at  0248:45 requesting a return phone call.   
3.2.17.  The rail protection officer made a further cell phone call to another worker at Bridge 49 at 
0249:53 . Again the call was not answered so another request to return his call was made .   
3.2.18.  At 0251:18 he had a 40 -second phone conversation with the structures field engineer who 
was off site at that time .  The structures field engineer had left Bridge 52 at about 1900 the 
previous day after  the work group had started to fix the rail to the replacement bridge 
sleepers .  The structures field engineer told him that the phone of the leading hand at Bridge 
49 had become saturated during the weekend and was no longer functioning.  The structures

completed .    
3.2.19.  The rail protection officer made a  further call to the leading hand at Bridge 52 at 0252:37 , but 
again the call was not answered.  A message was left asking him for a progress report.   
3.2.20.  At 0254:53 t he rail protection officer phoned a thi rd person  who was at Bridge 49 .  When this 
call was not answered a further request to return his call was left as a voice message.   
3.2.21.  At 0255:11 the leading hand from the Bridge 52 worksite phoned  the rail protection officer.  
He confirmed that the work gro up had left the worksite.  He reported that all  equipment  was 
reported as clear of the track and that the bridge was safe for trains to pass over  at the posted 
25-kilometre -per-hour temporary speed restriction.  
3.2.22.  Despite not hearing from any members of the work group at Bridge 49, the rail protection 
officer phoned the train controller at 0259:33 .  He reported  that all personnel  and equipment 
were clear of the track  and he 'handed back ' Track Warrant 88 .  He confirmed that there was 
a 25-kilometre -per-hour t emporary speed restriction over both  bridge s.  The train controller 
asked whether the rail protection officer was at Featherston , to which he answered , "Yes".    
3.2.23.  Immediately after he handed back the track warrant he placed his cell phone beside his bed 
and was asleep within minutes.  
3.2.24.  At 0303 the train controller issued Track Warrant 5 to the driver of a repositioning passenger 
train at Featherston  to proceed from the loop to Masterton.  Clause 6 of the track warrant 
stated  that the mainline had been repor ted clear at 0300 .  
3.2.25.  At 0308 one of the workers at Bridge 49 responded  to the rail protection officer 's voicemail 
message , but the rail protection officer did not  answer .  He left a  voicemail  message  for the 
rail protection officer stating that the work gro up was securing the last section of rail to the 
bridge sleepers and that they expected to be clear of the track within the next  30 minutes.  
3.2.26.  The repositioning train departed from  Featherston at about 0313.  At 0318 the driver was 
slowing  his train for the 25-kilometre -per-hour temporary speed restriction across  Bridge 49  
when he  saw flashing lights from a vehicle that appeared to be on track  at the north end of the 
bridge .  He stopped the train a few metres from the south end of the bridge, some 180 metres 
short of  the hi-rail excavator and the work group that was occupying the track .

The approach to Bridge 49 from the south  
3.2.27.  The leading hand was startled by the approaching train.  He believed that Track Warrant 88 
was still active as he had not yet told the rail protection officer that the planned work had 
finished and the track had been cleared.  He used the radio fitted to the hi -rail excavator to 
instruct the train driver to remain stationary until the track  was cleared.   
3.2.28.  At 032 1:32  the leading hand radioed the train driver and gave him a 'clear to proceed ' 
instruction .  The train driver stopped at the north end of the bridge at 0322:44  and alight ed 
from the cab to converse with the work group.  The train then continued towards Masterton . 
3.2.29.  As the train got underway the train driver radioed the train controller to inform him that he had 
come across the work group and equipment still on track at the north end of Bridge 49.  The 
train controller immediately placed a block  in the track warrant computer system9 for the track 
section between Featherston and Dalefield to protect the work group before he authoris ed the 
train to proceed.    
3.2.30.  The train controller phoned the rail protection officer's cell phone at 0326:54 , but the call was 
not answered , so he left a voicemail message asking him to call train control.   
3.2.31.  The leading hand at Bridge 49 phoned train control at 0342  to report that all work  at the 
bridge had finished and that the bridge was safe for trains to pass over at the restricted speed 
of 25 kilometres per hour.   
3.3. Key personnel  
3.3.1.  In accordance with KiwiRail procedures , the rail protection officer and  all personnel on site at 
Bridge 49 at the time of the incident underwent  post-incident drug and alcohol screening 
tests.  All personnel returned negative result s.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 4. Analysis   
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The safety  of personnel working on the rail network is paramount.  Failure to comply with any 
of the processes or procedures for providing protection can potentially result in a collision , as 
nearly happened in this case.  
4.1.2.  From a train control perspective, the train controller was entitled to issue the passenger train 
with a track warrant to pass through the area.  He had had positive confirmation from the rail 
protection officer that he was on site and that the worksite  was clear, although neither was the 
case .   
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses t hree  safety issues identified that were factors in this  near 
collision : 
 the process for planning and approving the worksite  was not fully completed as required 
by KiwiRail processes  
 the process for planning and approving the worksite  allowed one person to carry out the 
rail protection duties over two separate worksites within a protected work area for a 
52.5 -hour track occupation period , with no relief  
 there was insufficient manageme nt of  the rail protection officer 's day-to-day workload , 
which likely contributed to his being fatigue d at the time he reported the track as clear, 
when it was not .  
4.2. Protection of the worksite  
4.2.1.  KiwiRail's Operating Rule 401 (d) allowed  for a track warrant to be issued to the rail protection 
officer .  The warrant allow ed work on or alongside the mainline without any other protection . 
4.2.2.  The role of the rail protection officer was created by KiwiRail in response to protection issues 
that had  arisen, particularly at multiple worksites.  The prime purpose of the role was to 
provide overall protection for a work area, co -ordinate rail movements within and through the 
protected work area and communicate with train control.  Although all train mov ements had 
been suspended during the 52.5 -hour work period, the activity still required hi -rail vehicle 
movements within the work area.  The rail protection officer was responsible for ensuring that 
such movements were carried out in a safe manner . 
4.2.3.  At the time of the incident t here was no specific instruction from KiwiRail that the rail 
protection officer was to remain at the site for the entire period of work.  Feasibly, the work 
area could have been adequately protected without his presence, provided ther e was an 
agreed communication plan and provided the rail protection officer was present at crucial 
times.  The ending of the worksite  occupation and the handing back of the track to train 
control was considered a crucial time.  
4.2.4.  There were two separate work groups at each bridge site , working on a rotating basis.  It was 
not possible for one person alone to fulfil the duties of the rail protection officer continually for 
more than two days.  The need to relieve the rail protection officer was not identified a t the 
planning stage or during the work phase , even though KiwiRail's Track Warrant Control Rule 
410 had provision for such an event.  
4.2.5.  Critical to the events leading to this incident was the rail protection officer's location.  Had he 
been located within th e protected work area at the time that the track warrant was handed 
back he would have seen that the planned work at Bridge 49 was not complete, that 
personnel were still working in the area, and that it was unsafe for trains to pass.   
4.2.6.  Good railway practi ce would have given better guidance as to the level of presence required of 
the rail protection officer.  Since this incident KiwiRail  has introduced new Track Safety Rule 
902, Managing a Protected Work Area and the associated Job Aid from January 2015 (see 
section 6).   
 
Final Report RO -2014 —105 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.2.7.  New Track Safety Rule 902 (b) states in part:  
Location of Rail Protection Officer  
The RPO [rail protection officer] must r emain in the limits of the Protected Work 
Area, unless the co -ordination of significant multiple work site activity is 
controlled from an approved location named on the Information Bulletin.  
Job Aid  
Rail protection personnel must be issued with the relevan t "Rule 902 Managing 
a Protected Work Area Job Aid"  and must have it available on site.  
4.2.8.  New Track Safety Rule 902 (n) states in part:  
Handover  of Protected Work Area/Work Site  
When a Work Area and associated Work Sites are handed over between RPOs 
[rail protection officers], Assistant RPOs or SPs [site protectors] the procedures in 
the relevant "Rule 902 Managing a Protected Work Area Job Aid" must be 
applied.    
4.2.9.  Had this new rule been in place at the time and complied with , it is highly likely the incident 
would not have occurred.  
4.2.10.  The rail protection officer made his last site visit  on Sunday  10 August .  He left the protected 
work area  at about 1500 , 12 hours before the work was  scheduled to be completed .  At that 
time the sleeper replacement work at Bridge 49 was more advanced than that at Bridge 52.  
4.2.11.  Before he left the site the rail protection officer  instruct ed the leading hands that during  their 
1800 -chang eover the incoming le ading hand s must be told to contact him when  the track had 
been cleared the next morning , so that the track warrant could be cancelled .  Relying on a 
verbal instruction given  three hours before the leading hands were due to change over and 
approximately 12 hours before the track was likely to be clear was risky .  There was  some 
potential for them to forget to  pass on the instruction s to their relief s and, even if the message 
were  passed on, for the reliefs to forget to call the rail protection officer when the track was 
clear  some nine hours later . 
4.2.12.  It would have been good practice for  the rail protection officer to contact the incoming leading 
hands t o confirm that they had both  received the instruction to call him when the  track was 
clear .  Had he done so it might have raised some doubt as to whether the track  was actually 
clear when he did not  receive a call the following morning from the leading hand at Bridge 49, 
and could not make contact with him . 
4.2.13.  At 024 5 the rail protection officer  woke naturally before he call ed the leading hand at Bridge 
49, but his call was not answered .  At 0251  he called  the structures field engineer  who had 
left the worksite the previous evening .  During their conversation he was made aware that the 
cell phone belonging to  the leading hand at Bridge 49 was not functioning.   
4.2.14.  After a series of phone calls , the rail protection officer was provided with confirmation that the 
track was safe for trains to pass over Bridge 52, but he had no information in respect of t he 
situation at Bridge 49.  The rail protection officer made two further unsuccessful attempts to 
contact personnel at Bridge 49.  
4.2.15.  Handing back the track warrant that was protecting his worksite  to train control without 
positively establishing that the work  group  at Bridge 49 was off and clear was a serious 
breach of KiwiRail rules , a breach that could have resulted in an accident . 
4.2.16.  When asked by the train controller whether he was on site at the time of giving clearance, the 
person in charge answered 'yes', when he was not.  This answer is an indication that the 
person in charge knew and felt that he should have been there at the time.  Some possible 
reasons for this behaviour are discussed in section 4.4.  
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report RO -2014 -105 4.3. Operating procedures (planning)  
4.3.1.  A failure to follow  operating procedures at the planning stage of the work assignment resulted 
in the work group being under -resourced to manage the protection and safety of the work 
group  effectively .  
4.3.2.  KiwiRail's procedures required application s for planned work that involve d 'line impassable'  to 
be submitted with at least  15 days' notice.  While the regional planning team was aware of the 
need to replace sleepers on Bridges 49 and 52, the  application for a line closure between  
Featherston and Dalefield from Friday 8 August t o 0300 Monday 11 August  gave  only 10 days' 
notice . The submitter  proposed  that the work be carried out  using KiwiRail's Track Warrant 
Control Rule  401 (d) to protec t the multiple worksite activity.   
4.3.3.  Rule 401 (d) stated:  
A track warrant may be issued to allow work on or alongside the mainline without 
other protection.  A track warrant issued for other than trains must be addressed 
to the person responsible for safe working [the rail protection officer].   
4.3.4.  KiwiRail's operati ng instructions for train control, clause 12.8.3 , stated in part:  
Where a track warrant is issued under this rule [401 (d)] the addressee, in 
addition to holding the appropriate current operating certificate must be able to 
be contacted by Train Control (e .g. have train control radio equipment ) or be 
instructed to call Train Control at regular intervals as would be appropriate in the 
circumstances.    
4.3.5.  KiwiRail Track Safety  Rule 901 (e) stated in part:  
e. Communication Plan  
 A Work Area Communi cation Plan mu st be prepared when:  
 The work area exceeds 1 km in length  
 When channel 1 radio coverage is not possible: the person 
planning protection must specify how communications will be 
managed  
 When there are multiple adjoining work sites protected by one 
RPO [rail protection officer ] 
The Work Area Communication Plan must be submitted with the 
application for planned work, specifying how the RPO [rail protection 
officer] will communicate with protected personnel/operators and Drivers 
of Hi Rail vehicles .  
The application  for the  planned work was made by the rail protection officer .  Although it was 
submitted later than the procedures stipulated , it was still accepted by KiwiRail Network 
Authorities  and the information bulletin  was issued , even though  a communic ation plan was not 
attached . 
Findings  
1 The near collision between the train and the hi-rail excavator occurred because 
the rail protection officer informed  train control that the worksite  was clear 
without first checking  positively  that it was.  
2 It would have exceeded the normal limitations of human performance  for the 
rail protection officer to be on site for the entire 52.5 -hour duration of the 
planned work.   However, the release of the track warrant to end the track 
occupation was a safety -critical task that required the rail protection officer's 
presence at the worksite.  
 
Final Report RO -2014 —105 
<< Page 13 >>
 3 The KiwiRail process for planning and authorising the worksite  was not entirely 
followed.  The late application and the omission of a communication plan were 
factors contributi ng to the incident . 
4.4. Fatigue   
4.4.1.  Did the rail protection officer have the opportunity to recover from sleep debt during the 52.5 
hours he was performing his duties , and did the extended work period influence his decision 
to cancel the track warrant?  
4.4.2.  In the seven days leading up to the incident , the rail protection officer  had had one day where 
his work commitments were limited . On all other days he had worked for more than eight 
hours  and on four occasions 10 hours or more, resulting in a 60 -hour work week  (Table 1) .  He 
could not recall the last time that he had two consecutive days completely free of work , and 
regularly worked at weekend s to catch up.   
4.4.3.  The Commission engaged Associate Professor Leigh Signal of the Sleep/Wake Research 
Centre  at Massey Unive rsity, New Zealand, to review the rail protection officer's work/rest 
pattern s and length s of shift and provide feedback as to whether fatigue would have  likely 
contributed to the incident.  On 22 September 2016 Associate Professor Signal and Doctor 
Lora Wu conducted an in -person interview with the rail protection officer.   
4.4.4.  Fatigue is a broad term often used to describe a wide range of symptoms.  For this reason, 
there can be confusion about what 'fatigue' is and what the causes are.  The approach used 
by Dr Signal for analysing the information was based on that developed by the United States 
National Transport ation  Safety Board and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration 's Ames Cant er's Fatigue Countermeasures Program , which focused on the 
physiological factors known to impair an individual's functioning.  These physiological factors 
included  sleep loss  or extended wakefulness , circadian biological clock  and workload .  
Appendix 4 gives a description of the terminology u sed by Associate Professor Signal.  
The opinion of the sleep expert  
The rail protection officer's g eneral sleep pattern/recovery sleep  
4.4.5.  The rail protection officer normally went to bed at about 1900 and woke at 0500.  At the time 
of the incident he often felt sleepy during the day and ate sweets to give him self energy.  While 
it was not possible to determine whether he had a sleep disorder , his daytime sleepiness does 
suggest that the amount and/or quality of his sleep was not sufficient at the time of the  
incident.  
4.4.6.  In the week leading up to the incident  he had spent Monday to Wednesday sleeping away 
from home.  On those nights he had gone to bed at his usual time of 1900 but watched 
movies.  It was not known when he went to sleep.  He also stated that he had not slept as well 
as he normally did on those nights.  While the amount of sleep he  had obtained is unknown , it 
was likely less than h e normally obtained.  
4.4.7.  On the afternoon of 8 August 2014 he had a nap of about 90 minutes before travelling to the 
worksi te and starting the 52.5 -hour shift.  After returning home he might have obtained four 
hours ' sleep at best, resulting in a 24 -hour period during which he obtained substantially less 
sleep than he normally obtained and less than the recommended amount to m aintain 
performance.  Owing to his being on duty/on call, it is also possible that the quality of sleep he 
obtained on 9 and 10 August  was adversely affected   
4.4.8.  The rail protection officer awoke naturally before starting to call various individuals at the tw o 
worksites.  However, he was not certain of the time he woke and therefore the length of time 
between waking and handing back Track W arrant 88.  He said that he placed the phone on its 
normal setting, beside his bed, after handing back the track warrant.  He went back to sleep 
and did not wake in response to any of nine  separate phone calls made to him from 0308:11 
onwards.  The rail protection officer made his first phone call after waking at 0632:46, some 
90 minutes later than his normal wake time.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 The r ail protection officer's shift cycles  
4.4.9.  The rail protection officer  had worked relatively long hours in the week leading up to the 
incident and had had no days completely free of work.  The days and hours he had worked 
provided limited opportunity for recovery from any fatigue that may have built up through the 
hours worked, any sleep loss that may have built up over time, and the severe sleep loss 
experienced on the first night of the planned work.     
The rail protecti on officer's length of shift  
4.4.10.  The rail protection officer was the only individual rostered to fill this role for the entire 52.5 -
hour work period.  However, he did not remain on site throughout the work period.  He visited 
the worksite at the start of the w ork period and returned home to sleep .  He attended the 
worksite for a couple of hours on each of the next two days , but was not on site at the critical 
time to confirm that the protected work area was clear and the track was safe for the passage 
of trains  before handing back the track warrant.   
4.4.11.  It was not possible for one person to fulfil the role and responsibilities of the rail protection 
officer for a continuous 52.5 hours without relief.   
Was fatigue likely to have contributed to the incident ? 
4.4.12.  For an  incident or accident to be defined as fatigue related , it must have both:  
 occurred in the presence of fatigue, and  
 been consistent with a fatigue -related error (i.e. caused by falling asleep, inattention , 
delayed reaction time  or error in judgement ). 
4.4.13.  The rail protection officer was likely experiencing fatigue during the early hours of Monday 11 
August 2014 , caused by a number of factors including his : 
 relatively high workload and long work days in the week leading up to the incident  
 excessively long duty w ork period of 52.5 hours following a full work week  
 possible sleep restriction on Monday 4 August through to  Wednesday 6 August  
 severe sleep restriction on Friday 8 August  
 lack of opportunity to recover from this sleep restriction before the planned work 
period    
 need to perform work -related duties during his biological night when he would 
normally be asleep.  
4.4.14.  The im paired judgement of the rail protection officer, which included making the incorrect 
assumption that the work had been completed and the track was clear, was consistent with 
fatigue -related performance.  He was also required to perform these tasks at an adverse 
circadian phase  (see Appendix 4) .  For an individual with normal circadian phase and normal 
sleep timing, poorest performance would typically be at around 0400.  However, given the rail 
protection officer's possible circadian preference of extreme morning t ype, it is very likely that 
he handed back the track warrant during his individual circadian low point in performance.   
4.4.15.  In addition, the rail protection officer may have experienced sleep inertia that contributed to 
his impaired judgement in the early hou rs of Monday 11 August.  Sleep inertia has been 
shown to be more severe for tasks that involve decision -making, when prior sleep restriction is 
experienced and in the early hours of the morning.  This incident did involve decision -making, 
the rail protecti on officer 's sleep was likely to have been restricted in the week leading up to 
the incident, and the track warrant handback occurred in the early hours of the morning.  
4.4.16.  The combination of the time of day,  likely  underlying level of fatigue, and sleep inert ia 
contributed to the errors .  
 
Final Report RO -2014 —105 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.4.17.  Given the factors that likely contributed to the rail protection officer 's level of fatigue , a 
recommendation has been made to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to address the company's 
Fitness for Work Policy.     
Findings  
4 It was likely that the rail protection officer was affected by an underlying level of 
fatigue and sleep inertia when he made the incorrect assumption that the work 
had been completed and the track was safe for trains to pass over.   
5 KiwiRail was not effect ively managing the rail protection officer's day -to-day 
workload , which was likely a factor contributing to an underlying level of fatigue at 
the time of the incident .

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 5. Findings  
5.1. The near collision between the train and the hi -rail excavator  occurred because the rail 
protection officer informed train control that the worksite  was clear without first checking  
positively  that it was.  
5.2. It would have exceeded the normal limitations of human performance  for the rail protection 
officer to be on site for the entire 52.5 -hour duration of the planned work.   However, t he 
release of the track warrant to end the track occupation was a safety -critical task that required 
the rail protection officer's presence at the worksite.  
5.3. The KiwiRail process for plannin g and authorising the worksite  was not entirely followed.  The 
late application and the omission of a communication plan were factors contributing to the 
incident.  
5.4. It was likely that the rail protection officer was affected by an underlying level of fatigu e and 
sleep inertia when he made the incorrect assumption that the work had been completed and 
the track was safe for trains to pass over.   
5.5. KiwiRail was not effectively managing the rail protection officer's day -to-day workload , which 
was likely a factor contributing to an underlying level of fatigue at the time of the incident.

 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during the inquiry  
6.2. KiwiRail's Operating Rule 910, Work Arrangements Multiple Activities, has been disc ontinued 
and replaced by Rule 902 Managing a Protected Work Area , together with Rule 902 Managing 
a Protected Work Area Job Aid.  The KiwiRail Track Safety Rules, Issue 3, which  included new 
site safety Rule 902 , was effective from 30 June 2015.   Rule 902 is referred to as a 'lock on , 
lock off' procedure.  
6.3. On arrival at  a protected work area all personnel , including the rail protection officer, 
contractors and visitors , must sign a worksite  register  TS90 form, to confirm that they have 
been briefed on  and understand the protection method, the worksite  limits , the safe place, the 
rail hazards and the need to report to the rail protection officer before leaving the worksite  
(see Figure 3) .  All vehicles likely to operate on the track are entered on the r egister by the 
driver s and include the vehicle radio 'call sign s'.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105  
6.4. All personnel and machinery entered on the worksite  register are allocated padlock s that are 
locked on to a numbered aluminium frame  before leaving the safe place (see Figure 4).  The 
padlocks are colour coded : green for the rail protection officer , orange for workers trained 
under Rule 902, blue for visitors and workers not trained in the procedures (but given 
instructions on arrival)  and black for hi -rail vehicles and equipment on track.  The lock -on 
frame is not made available for lock-on until the rail protection officer has entered a worksite  
'start' time on the Protected Work Area Logbook form, TS92.  The rail protection officer m ust 
attach their  green padlock to the frame handle before making it available to others to lock on.   
Personnel/ Vehicle padlocks must be secured in the same slot number s as recorded in the 
worksite register .  All personnel/vehicles must be locked on before leaving the safe place.   
 
Figure 4 
Locking on to start work   
6.5. The lock -on frame must not be made available for lock off until the rail protection officer has 
returned to the safe place, all vehicles have been secured in a safe mode clear of the track 
and all personnel , including visitors , have returned to the safe place.  The  rail protection 
officer must not remove the ir green padlock until all other padlocks have been removed.  The 
rail protection officer must then show the clear lock -on frame to personnel in the safe place 
before authorising rail movements or cancelling the protection authority.  At least one other 
person must acknowledge the clear frame.  The rail protection officer must maintain a view of 
the track and the safe place until the movement passes.   
6.6. A rail protection officer can only clear the protection author ity when all padlocks have been 
removed and all personnel have signed off the worksite register.   
6.7. On 8 August 2016 KiwiRail issued a Toolbox Topic, Consultation Document Change Proposal 
for Track Protection.  The document showed how KiwiRail intended to r educe the frequency of 
track occupation incidents by training and appointing dedicated rail protection officers and 
separating their  duties from those of a work supervisor/team leader /leading hand .   
6.8. Since this  incident KiwiRail  has established the role of protection planner.  This position 
provides a level of independent scrutiny of worksite protection arrangements and ensures that 
the protection services required is realistic and achievable.

 7. Recommendation  
General  
7.1. The C ommission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to th e wider transport 
sector.  In this case, one recommendation ha s been issued to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety , it is important that this recommendation  is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendation  made to KiwiRail  
7.3. The approval process authorised one person to carry out the rail protection duties for two 
separate worksites within a protected work area throughout a 52.5 -hour track occupation 
period wit hout appointing a relief rail protection officer .  The rail protection officer had worked 
relatively long hours during  the week leading up to the incident and had had no days 
completely free of work.  His working hours had  provided limited opportunity for recovery from 
any fatigue or sleep loss that may have built up , and particularly sleep loss that he 
experienced on the first night of the planned work.   
On 28 June 2017  the Commission recommend ed that the Chief Executive of Kiwi Rail review 
the company's F itness for Work Policy to ensure that the workload s of personnel undertaking 
safety -critical work , including staff not on a roster,  are managed effectively and that the risk of 
their suffering fro m the effects of fatigue is mitigated.  (017/17)  
7.4. On 14 July 2017 KiwiRail replied : 
KiwiRail  confirms that it accepts the intent of recommendation 017/17 and it will 
now scope the required compliance requirements and undertake the actions 
required to allow closure of the recommendation.  Starting at the corporate level, 
this will require the impl ementation of a business -wide policy that will ensure that 
management control measures are developed and adopted across the business 
to ensure that personnel performing safety -critical functions have their workloads 
managed to ensure they don't potentially  suffer the effects of fatigue, which 
could contribute towards unsafe actions, behaviours or decisions being made.

 Final Report RO -2014 -105 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Not following standard railway operating procedures that are designed to provide for safe 
railway operations is highly likely  to result in an accident . 
8.2. Decisions that can affect the safety of railway workers should never be based entirely on 
assumptions, as in this case when clearance was given for trains to pass through the area 
when workers were still occupying the track.

Sleep loss  
Sufficient good quality sleep is vital to sustaining normal levels of functioning. The amount of sleep 
required on a daily basis varies from one individual to the next, with the recommended amount between 
7-9 hours for a healthy adult, although some individuals may require as little as 6 hours of sleep and 
others as much as 10 hours.  When a short term or long term change in sleep results in less or poorer 
quality sleep than an individual's ideal daily slee p need, a sleep debt is said to occur and accrue.   
Acute  sleep  loss  
It has been shown that curtailing the usual amount of sleep for one night by as little as 2 hours 
produces measurable increases in sleepiness while decrements in performance are most app arent 
once sleep is restricted to 5 hours or less in a single night.  It is not only the amount of sleep obtained, 
but also the quality of sleep that is important.  One night of disturbed sleep (sleep that is lighter and 
fragmented by awakenings) is also re lated to increased sleepiness and decreased performance and 
mood the following day.  
Chronic  sleep  restriction    
When sleep is restricted or disturbed for more than one night, the effects accumulate and a sleep debt 
builds.  These effects are also dose -dependent, so that with greater nightly sleep restriction, 
performance and mood decline more rapidly.   
In a study that involved 4 groups of people who, across a week of sleep restriction, were either allowed 
9 hours, 7 hours, 5  hours or 3 hours in bed each night. The groups spending 5 or 7 hours in bed each 
night became progressively slower for the first 5 days after which their performance appeared to 
stabilise.  The performance of those who spent 3 hours in bed each night decl ined steadily across all 7 
days.  In this study, subjective sleepiness also increased across the first few days of sleep restriction but 
then tended to stabilise, although performance continued to decline. Thus, individuals tend to 
underestimate the extent  to which their performance is affected when sleep is chronically restricted.   
After periods of sleep restriction (e.g. 2 weeks of only 6 hours in bed), performance is equivalent to that 
seen under conditions of total sleep deprivation (e.g. no sleep for 24 hours), indicating that chronic 
partial sleep restriction can induce deficits in the waking brain that are similar to total sleep deprivation.  
More recent studies have shown that chronic sleep restriction interacts with time -of- day (circadian 
phase), resulting in the poorest performance during the biological night.  
Shortening a sleep opportunity will result in restricted sleep but it is also possible for an individual to 
spend sufficient time in bed and still not obtain enough sleep.  Many factors can  disrupt sleep but two 
issues of particular relevance are noted here. The first of these is that sleep may be impaired when an 
individual expects they may be called back to work.  In such instances the amount of sleep obtained as 
well as the quality may be  reduced. The literature in this area is, however, very limited.  
Sleep disorders are also of relevance due to their impact on the quantity and quality of sleep an 
individual is able to obtain and their potential impact on waking functioning including impai red 
performance, increased risk of accidents or incidents while driving, sleepiness, poor mood and poorer 
social adjustment.  There are a large number of sleep disorders, some of which are relatively common in 
the New Zealand population including sleep apn oea, insomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances and 
movement -related sleep disorders.  Physical and psychological health conditions, particularly those that 
result in pain, discomfort or anxiety, can also result in disturbed sleep.

 Recovery  from  chronic  sleep restriction  
A single night of recovery sleep is not considered sufficient to compensate for fatigue that has built up 
over an extended period of time, even if that recovery sleep is extended to 10 hours in bed.  After 
chronic sleep restriction, at least  two consecutive nights of unrestricted sleep are required for the 
structure of sleep to return to normal, with more slow -wave sleep than usual during the first night of 
recovery sleep, and more REM (dream) sleep than usual in the second night of recovery sleep. By the 
third night of recovery sleep, the structure of sleep usually returns to normal.  
However, the recovery of waking functioning may take longer than this. In the study mentioned above], it 
was noted that performance did not recover back to basel ine even after 3 nights of 8 hours per night in 
bed.  This suggests that chronic sleep restriction leads to long term and constant changes in functioning 
that may help an individual adapt to the effects of continued sleep restriction. However, these change s 
come at a cost, so that when sleep duration is extended and recovery allowed, a return to baseline 
levels of alertness and performance does not occur immediately.  
A recent study has shown that even 5 nights of 8 hours' recovery sleep was not sufficient to return 
performance to that seen prior to 7 nights of restricted sleep, but performance did recover more rapidly 
in individuals who had extended their sleep prior t o the week of sleep restriction.  
Expert working groups in trucking have recommended that at least two full nights of unrestricted sleep 
are required on a regular basis (preferably weekly) so that a significant sleep debt cannot accrue. 
Unrestricted night time sleep refers to an individual being able to go to bed and rise when they choose, 
with the sleep period overlapping the circadian period most conducive to sleep (see the section below 
on circadian phase for further explanation).  
Extended wakefulness  
It has been demonstrated that 8 -hours of night time sleep provides about 16 hours of day time 
wakefulness, after which decrements in performance appear.  To quantify the relative risk of impaired 
performance caused by sleep loss, a number of studies have com pared the effects of staying awake for 
extended periods to the effects of alcohol on performance. It has been shown that after an 0800 
wakeup, 17 hours of sustained wakefulness across the biological night, leads to performance 
decrements equivalent to that  observed when an individual is at the legal limit for blood alcohol 
concentration.  Several other studies also demonstrate that sleepiness increases with extended 
wakefulness.  
Circadian  phase  
Humans have peaks and troughs in daily functioning across a ran ge of physiological and behavioural 
variables, including temperature, hormone levels, the sleep -wake cycle, mood and performance.  These 
daily variations are controlled by a group of cells located in the brain referred to as the circadian 
biological clock.  The circadian clock effectively "programmes" us for wakefulness during the day and 
sleep at night and keeps in step with the earth's 24 -hour day -night cycle because it is sensitive to 
environmental cues, particularly exposure to light.  
Due to the circadi an biological clock, sleepiness is maximal in the early hours of the morning 
(approximately 3 -5am) with another, smaller peak in the middle of the afternoon (approximately 3 -5pm) 
(see figure below).  Although maximal sleepiness is in the early hours of the  morning, performance and 
alertness can be affected throughout the night hours when a person would normally be asleep.

Figure 5  
The influence of circadian body clock on sleep and alertness where an individual  
typically sleeps between 2300 and 0700  
The circadian system also helps maintain wakefulness during the day, making it difficult for individuals 
who are working at night and sleeping during the day to obtain sufficient good quality sleep.  Night shifts 
are not the only mechanism through which a sleep debt can accumulate.  Early morning starts that 
truncate night time sleep can also shorten sleep significantly and although individuals may attempt an 
earlier bed time in "preparation" for an early start, the c ircadian biological clock promotes wakefulness 
in the few hours before a person's habitual bedtime making it difficult to fall asleep earlier than usual.  
There are known differences in the timing of the circadian system between individuals.  These 
differe nces have a physiological basis but are also influenced by factors such as work patterns, and 
social and family commitments.  Morning types go to bed early and rise early whereas evening types go 
to bed later and rise later.  The prevalence of very morning  or evening oriented individuals is not well 
established but using a range of definitions, a New Zealand study has shown that the proportion of the 
population reporting being an extreme morning type ranges between <0.5% -9%, and an extreme 
evening type betw een <0.5% -10%.  
The effects of the circadian body clock cycle and sleep restriction interact: performance decrements 
resulting from sleep restriction are greater during the part of the circadian cycle when sleep would 
normally occur, even after short prior wake durations.    
Changes in cogn itive performance with fatigue  
There is often debate as to how well the performance changes seen on laboratory tasks, such as those 
discussed in the above studies, relate to "real world", or more cognitively complex, performance.  
Higher -order cognitive skills are thought to be reliant on the functioning of the prefrontal region of the 
cerebral cortex and recent evidence has shown that this area of the brain is affected by as little as one 
night of sleep loss.  Both simple and complex cog nitive tasks show deficits following sleep restriction 
including sustained attention and reaction time, working memory and cognitive throughput.  Harrison 
and Horne discuss evidence that suggests a raft of higher level cognitive skills are adversely affect ed by 
sleep loss. Those affected include: attending to complex information while filtering out distractions, 
following a situation and recognising the need to apply new strategies, lateral thinking and innovation, 
risk assessment, maintaining interest, con trolling mood and behaviour, the ability to self - monitor 
performance, and the ability to communicate effectively.

 Sleep Inertia   
One additional factor that deserves mention in the current context is sleep inertia.  Sleep inertia is a 
well-documented ph enomen a and  is a period of confusion, grogginess, low arousal and reduced 
functioning experienced immediately on awakening.   It can cause performance impairment that is worse 
than just before bedtime, when an individual would be expected to be more fatigue d.  
The process of waking up is not an on/off switch. A brain imaging study suggests that different parts of 
the brain reactivate at varying rates, and that functional connectivity among different brain regions 
needs to be reorganised to achieve a fully aw ake brain state. Activity in the brain regions that are 
associated with arousal returns very quickly during the waking process, whereas reactivation of the pre - 
frontal cortex, the brain region associated with higher -order cognitive functioning, takes long er.   
A number of factors can influence the severity and duration of sleep inertia, including the type of 
cognitive task performed upon awakening. The effects of sleep inertia can last from a minute to several 
hours, with longer -lasting effects on more com plex cognitive tasks, such as decision -making.  Research 
has also shown that the effects are greater following sleep restriction or when woken in the middle of 
the night.  The effects of sleep inertia may also be greater after waking from slow -wave sleep b ut are 
less severe when woken from REM (dream) sleep.  
Sleep inertia research has predominantly involved young adults and limited evidence suggests that 
older adults may be more susceptible to the effects of sleep inertia than their younger counterparts.  
To reduce the risk of impaired decision -making, it is suggested to allow at least 10 -15 minutes after 
waking for sleep inertia to dissipate before undertaking critical tasks.
