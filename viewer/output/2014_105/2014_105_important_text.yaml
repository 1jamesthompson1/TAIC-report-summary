  \  \n4.1.1.  The safety  of personnel working on the rail network is paramount.\
  \  Failure to comply with any \nof the processes or procedures for providing protection\
  \ can potentially result in a collision , as \nnearly happened in this case.  \n\
  4.1.2.  From a train control perspective, the train controller was entitled to issue\
  \ the passenger train \nwith a track warrant to pass through the area.  He had had\
  \ positive confirmation from the rail \nprotection officer that he was on site and\
  \ that the worksite  was clear, although neither was the \ncase .   \n4.1.3.  The\
  \ following analysis discusses t hree  safety issues identified that were factors\
  \ in this  near \ncollision : \n\uF0B7 the process for planning and approving the\
  \ worksite  was not fully completed as required \nby KiwiRail processes  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the process for planning and approving the worksite  allowed one person to carry\
  \ out the \nrail protection duties over two separate worksites within a protected\
  \ work area for a \n52.5 -hour track occupation period , with no relief  \n\uF0B7\
  \ there was insufficient manageme nt of  the rail protection officer 's day-to-day\
  \ workload , \nwhich likely contributed to his being fatigue d at the time he reported\
  \ the track as clear, \nwhen it was not .  \n4.2. Protection of the worksite  \n\
  4.2.1.  KiwiRail's Operating Rule 401 (d) allowed  for a track warrant to be issued\
  \ to the rail protection \nofficer .  The warrant allow ed work on or alongside\
  \ the mainline without any other protection . \n4.2.2.  The role of the rail protection\
  \ officer was created by KiwiRail in response to protection issues \nthat had  arisen,\
  \ particularly at multiple worksites.  The prime purpose of the role was to \nprovide\
  \ overall protection for a work area, co -ordinate rail movements within and through\
  \ the \nprotected work area and communicate with train control.  Although all train\
  \ mov ements had \nbeen suspended during the 52.5 -hour work period, the activity\
  \ still required hi -rail vehicle \nmovements within the work area.  The rail protection\
  \ officer was responsible for ensuring that \nsuch movements were carried out in\
  \ a safe manner . \n4.2.3.  At the time of the incident t here was no specific instruction\
  \ from KiwiRail that the rail \nprotection officer was to remain at the site for\
  \ the entire period of work.  Feasibly, the work \narea could have been adequately\
  \ protected without his presence, provided ther e was an \nagreed communication\
  \ plan and provided the rail protection officer was present at crucial \ntimes.\
  \  The ending of the worksite  occupation and the handing back of the track to train\
  \ \ncontrol was considered a crucial time.  \n4.2.4.  There were two separate work\
  \ groups at each bridge site , working on a rotating basis.  It was \nnot possible\
  \ for one person alone to fulfil the duties of the rail protection officer continually\
  \ for \nmore than two days.  The need to relieve the rail protection officer was\
  \ not identified a t the \nplanning stage or during the work phase , even though\
  \ KiwiRail's Track Warrant Control Rule \n410 had provision for such an event. \
  \ \n4.2.5.  Critical to the events leading to this incident was the rail protection\
  \ officer's location.  Had he \nbeen located within th e protected work area at\
  \ the time that the track warrant was handed \nback he would have seen that the\
  \ planned work at Bridge 49 was not complete, that \npersonnel were still working\
  \ in the area, and that it was unsafe for trains to pass.   \n4.2.6.  Good railway\
  \ practi ce would have given better guidance as to the level of presence required\
  \ of \nthe rail protection officer.  Since this incident KiwiRail  has introduced\
  \ new Track Safety Rule \n902, Managing a Protected Work Area and the associated\
  \ Job Aid from January 2015 (see \nsection 6).   \n \nFinal Report RO -2014 \u2014\
  105 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.2.7.  New Track Safety Rule 902 (b) states in part:  \n\
  Location of Rail Protection Officer  \nThe RPO [rail protection officer] must r\
  \ emain in the limits of the Protected Work \nArea, unless the co -ordination of\
  \ significant multiple work site activity is \ncontrolled from an approved location\
  \ named on the Information Bulletin.  \nJob Aid  \nRail protection personnel must\
  \ be issued with the relevan t \"Rule 902 Managing \na Protected Work Area Job Aid\"\
  \  and must have it available on site.  \n4.2.8.  New Track Safety Rule 902 (n)\
  \ states in part:  \nHandover  of Protected Work Area/Work Site  \nWhen a Work Area\
  \ and associated Work Sites are handed over between RPOs \n[rail protection officers],\
  \ Assistant RPOs or SPs [site protectors] the procedures in \nthe relevant \"Rule\
  \ 902 Managing a Protected Work Area Job Aid\" must be \napplied.    \n4.2.9.  Had\
  \ this new rule been in place at the time and complied with , it is highly likely\
  \ the incident \nwould not have occurred.  \n4.2.10.  The rail protection officer\
  \ made his last site visit  on Sunday  10 August .  He left the protected \nwork\
  \ area  at about 1500 , 12 hours before the work was  scheduled to be completed\
  \ .  At that \ntime the sleeper replacement work at Bridge 49 was more advanced\
  \ than that at Bridge 52.  \n4.2.11.  Before he left the site the rail protection\
  \ officer  instruct ed the leading hands that during  their \n1800 -chang eover\
  \ the incoming le ading hand s must be told to contact him when  the track had \n\
  been cleared the next morning , so that the track warrant could be cancelled . \
  \ Relying on a \nverbal instruction given  three hours before the leading hands\
  \ were due to change over and \napproximately 12 hours before the track was likely\
  \ to be clear was risky .  There was  some \npotential for them to forget to  pass\
  \ on the instruction s to their relief s and, even if the message \nwere  passed\
  \ on, for the reliefs to forget to call the rail protection officer when the track\
  \ was \nclear  some nine hours later . \n4.2.12.  It would have been good practice\
  \ for  the rail protection officer to contact the incoming leading \nhands t o confirm\
  \ that they had both  received the instruction to call him when the  track was \n\
  clear .  Had he done so it might have raised some doubt as to whether the track\
  \  was actually \nclear when he did not  receive a call the following morning from\
  \ the leading hand at Bridge 49, \nand could not make contact with him . \n4.2.13.\
  \  At 024 5 the rail protection officer  woke naturally before he call ed the leading\
  \ hand at Bridge \n49, but his call was not answered .  At 0251  he called  the\
  \ structures field engineer  who had \nleft the worksite the previous evening .\
  \  During their conversation he was made aware that the \ncell phone belonging to\
  \  the leading hand at Bridge 49 was not functioning.   \n4.2.14.  After a series\
  \ of phone calls , the rail protection officer was provided with confirmation that\
  \ the \ntrack was safe for trains to pass over Bridge 52, but he had no information\
  \ in respect of t he \nsituation at Bridge 49.  The rail protection officer made\
  \ two further unsuccessful attempts to \ncontact personnel at Bridge 49.  \n4.2.15.\
  \  Handing back the track warrant that was protecting his worksite  to train control\
  \ without \npositively establishing that the work  group  at Bridge 49 was off and\
  \ clear was a serious \nbreach of KiwiRail rules , a breach that could have resulted\
  \ in an accident . \n4.2.16.  When asked by the train controller whether he was\
  \ on site at the time of giving clearance, the \nperson in charge answered 'yes',\
  \ when he was not.  This answer is an indication that the \nperson in charge knew\
  \ and felt that he should have been there at the time.  Some possible \nreasons\
  \ for this behaviour are discussed in section 4.4.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final\
  \ Report RO -2014 -105 4.3. Operating procedures (planning)  \n4.3.1.  A failure\
  \ to follow  operating procedures at the planning stage of the work assignment resulted\
  \ \nin the work group being under -resourced to manage the protection and safety\
  \ of the work \ngroup  effectively .  \n4.3.2.  KiwiRail's procedures required application\
  \ s for planned work that involve d 'line impassable'  to \nbe submitted with at\
  \ least  15 days' notice.  While the regional planning team was aware of the \n\
  need to replace sleepers on Bridges 49 and 52, the  application for a line closure\
  \ between  \nFeatherston and Dalefield from Friday 8 August t o 0300 Monday 11 August\
  \  gave  only 10 days' \nnotice . The submitter  proposed  that the work be carried\
  \ out  using KiwiRail's Track Warrant \nControl Rule  401 (d) to protec t the multiple\
  \ worksite activity.   \n4.3.3.  Rule 401 (d) stated:  \nA track warrant may be\
  \ issued to allow work on or alongside the mainline without \nother protection.\
  \  A track warrant issued for other than trains must be addressed \nto the person\
  \ responsible for safe working [the rail protection officer].   \n4.3.4.  KiwiRail's\
  \ operati ng instructions for train control, clause 12.8.3 , stated in part:  \n\
  Where a track warrant is issued under this rule [401 (d)] the addressee, in \naddition\
  \ to holding the appropriate current operating certificate must be able to \nbe\
  \ contacted by Train Control (e .g. have train control radio equipment ) or be \n\
  instructed to call Train Control at regular intervals as would be appropriate in\
  \ the \ncircumstances.    \n4.3.5.  KiwiRail Track Safety  Rule 901 (e) stated in\
  \ part:  \ne. Communication Plan  \n A Work Area Communi cation Plan mu st be prepared\
  \ when:  \n\uF0B7 The work area exceeds 1 km in length  \n\uF0B7 When channel 1\
  \ radio coverage is not possible: the person \nplanning protection must specify\
  \ how communications will be \nmanaged  \n\uF0B7 When there are multiple adjoining\
  \ work sites protected by one \nRPO [rail protection officer ] \nThe Work Area Communication\
  \ Plan must be submitted with the \napplication for planned work, specifying how\
  \ the RPO [rail protection \nofficer] will communicate with protected personnel/operators\
  \ and Drivers \nof Hi Rail vehicles .  \nThe application  for the  planned work\
  \ was made by the rail protection officer .  Although it was \nsubmitted later than\
  \ the procedures stipulated , it was still accepted by KiwiRail Network \nAuthorities\
  \  and the information bulletin  was issued , even though  a communic ation plan\
  \ was not \nattached . \nFindings  \n1 The near collision between the train and\
  \ the hi-rail excavator occurred because \nthe rail protection officer informed\
  \  train control that the worksite  was clear \nwithout first checking  positively\
  \  that it was.  \n2 It would have exceeded the normal limitations of human performance\
  \  for the \nrail protection officer to be on site for the entire 52.5 -hour duration\
  \ of the \nplanned work.   However, the release of the track warrant to end the\
  \ track \noccupation was a safety -critical task that required the rail protection\
  \ officer's \npresence at the worksite.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2014 \u2014105 \n\
  << Page 13 >>\n 3 The KiwiRail process for planning and authorising the worksite\
  \  was not entirely \nfollowed.  The late application and the omission of a communication\
  \ plan were \nfactors contributi ng to the incident . \n4.4. Fatigue   \n4.4.1.\
  \  Did the rail protection officer have the opportunity to recover from sleep debt\
  \ during the 52.5 \nhours he was performing his duties , and did the extended work\
  \ period influence his decision \nto cancel the track warrant?  \n4.4.2.  In the\
  \ seven days leading up to the incident , the rail protection officer  had had one\
  \ day where \nhis work commitments were limited . On all other days he had worked\
  \ for more than eight \nhours  and on four occasions 10 hours or more, resulting\
  \ in a 60 -hour work week  (Table 1) .  He \ncould not recall the last time that\
  \ he had two consecutive days completely free of work , and \nregularly worked at\
  \ weekend s to catch up.   \n4.4.3.  The Commission engaged Associate Professor\
  \ Leigh Signal of the Sleep/Wake Research \nCentre  at Massey Unive rsity, New Zealand,\
  \ to review the rail protection officer's work/rest \npattern s and length s of\
  \ shift and provide feedback as to whether fatigue would have  likely \ncontributed\
  \ to the incident.  On 22 September 2016 Associate Professor Signal and Doctor \n\
  Lora Wu conducted an in -person interview with the rail protection officer.   \n\
  4.4.4.  Fatigue is a broad term often used to describe a wide range of symptoms.\
  \  For this reason, \nthere can be confusion about what 'fatigue' is and what the\
  \ causes are.  The approach used \nby Dr Signal for analysing the information was\
  \ based on that developed by the United States \nNational Transport ation  Safety\
  \ Board and the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration 's Ames Cant er's\
  \ Fatigue Countermeasures Program , which focused on the \nphysiological factors\
  \ known to impair an individual's functioning.  These physiological factors \nincluded\
  \  sleep loss  or extended wakefulness , circadian biological clock  and workload\
  \ .  \nAppendix 4 gives a description of the terminology u sed by Associate Professor\
  \ Signal.  \nThe opinion of the sleep expert  \nThe rail protection officer's g\
  \ eneral sleep pattern/recovery sleep  \n4.4.5.  The rail protection officer normally\
  \ went to bed at about 1900 and woke at 0500.  At the time \nof the incident he\
  \ often felt sleepy during the day and ate sweets to give him self energy.  While\
  \ \nit was not possible to determine whether he had a sleep disorder , his daytime\
  \ sleepiness does \nsuggest that the amount and/or quality of his sleep was not\
  \ sufficient at the time of the  \nincident.  \n4.4.6.  In the week leading up to\
  \ the incident  he had spent Monday to Wednesday sleeping away \nfrom home.  On\
  \ those nights he had gone to bed at his usual time of 1900 but watched \nmovies.\
  \  It was not known when he went to sleep.  He also stated that he had not slept\
  \ as well \nas he normally did on those nights.  While the amount of sleep he  had\
  \ obtained is unknown , it \nwas likely less than h e normally obtained.  \n4.4.7.\
  \  On the afternoon of 8 August 2014 he had a nap of about 90 minutes before travelling\
  \ to the \nworksi te and starting the 52.5 -hour shift.  After returning home he\
  \ might have obtained four \nhours ' sleep at best, resulting in a 24 -hour period\
  \ during which he obtained substantially less \nsleep than he normally obtained\
  \ and less than the recommended amount to m aintain \nperformance.  Owing to his\
  \ being on duty/on call, it is also possible that the quality of sleep he \nobtained\
  \ on 9 and 10 August  was adversely affected   \n4.4.8.  The rail protection officer\
  \ awoke naturally before starting to call various individuals at the tw o \nworksites.\
  \  However, he was not certain of the time he woke and therefore the length of time\
  \ \nbetween waking and handing back Track W arrant 88.  He said that he placed the\
  \ phone on its \nnormal setting, beside his bed, after handing back the track warrant.\
  \  He went back to sleep \nand did not wake in response to any of nine  separate\
  \ phone calls made to him from 0308:11 \nonwards.  The rail protection officer made\
  \ his first phone call after waking at 0632:46, some \n90 minutes later than his\
  \ normal wake time.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2014 -105 The r ail protection\
  \ officer's shift cycles  \n4.4.9.  The rail protection officer  had worked relatively\
  \ long hours in the week leading up to the \nincident and had had no days completely\
  \ free of work.  The days and hours he had worked \nprovided limited opportunity\
  \ for recovery from any fatigue that may have built up through the \nhours worked,\
  \ any sleep loss that may have built up over time, and the severe sleep loss \n\
  experienced on the first night of the planned work.     \nThe rail protecti on officer's\
  \ length of shift  \n4.4.10.  The rail protection officer was the only individual\
  \ rostered to fill this role for the entire 52.5 -\nhour work period.  However,\
  \ he did not remain on site throughout the work period.  He visited \nthe worksite\
  \ at the start of the w ork period and returned home to sleep .  He attended the\
  \ \nworksite for a couple of hours on each of the next two days , but was not on\
  \ site at the critical \ntime to confirm that the protected work area was clear\
  \ and the track was safe for the passage \nof trains  before handing back the track\
  \ warrant.   \n4.4.11.  It was not possible for one person to fulfil the role and\
  \ responsibilities of the rail protection \nofficer for a continuous 52.5 hours\
  \ without relief.   \nWas fatigue likely to have contributed to the incident ? \n\
  4.4.12.  For an  incident or accident to be defined as fatigue related , it must\
  \ have both:  \n\uF0B7 occurred in the presence of fatigue, and  \n\uF0B7 been consistent\
  \ with a fatigue -related error (i.e. caused by falling asleep, inattention , \n\
  delayed reaction time  or error in judgement ). \n4.4.13.  The rail protection officer\
  \ was likely experiencing fatigue during the early hours of Monday 11 \nAugust 2014\
  \ , caused by a number of factors including his : \n\uF0B7 relatively high workload\
  \ and long work days in the week leading up to the incident  \n\uF0B7 excessively\
  \ long duty w ork period of 52.5 hours following a full work week  \n\uF0B7 possible\
  \ sleep restriction on Monday 4 August through to  Wednesday 6 August  \n\uF0B7\
  \ severe sleep restriction on Friday 8 August  \n\uF0B7 lack of opportunity to recover\
  \ from this sleep restriction before the planned work \nperiod    \n\uF0B7 need\
  \ to perform work -related duties during his biological night when he would \nnormally\
  \ be asleep.  \n4.4.14.  The im paired judgement of the rail protection officer,\
  \ which included making the incorrect \nassumption that the work had been completed\
  \ and the track was clear, was consistent with \nfatigue -related performance. \
  \ He was also required to perform these tasks at an adverse \ncircadian phase  (see\
  \ Appendix 4) .  For an individual with normal circadian phase and normal \nsleep\
  \ timing, poorest performance would typically be at around 0400.  However, given\
  \ the rail \nprotection officer's possible circadian preference of extreme morning\
  \ t ype, it is very likely that \nhe handed back the track warrant during his individual\
  \ circadian low point in performance.   \n4.4.15.  In addition, the rail protection\
  \ officer may have experienced sleep inertia that contributed to \nhis impaired\
  \ judgement in the early hou rs of Monday 11 August.  Sleep inertia has been \n\
  shown to be more severe for tasks that involve decision -making, when prior sleep\
  \ restriction is \nexperienced and in the early hours of the morning.  This incident\
  \ did involve decision -making, \nthe rail protecti on officer 's sleep was likely\
  \ to have been restricted in the week leading up to \nthe incident, and the track\
  \ warrant handback occurred in the early hours of the morning.  \n4.4.16.  The combination\
  \ of the time of day,  likely  underlying level of fatigue, and sleep inert ia \n\
  contributed to the errors .  \n \nFinal Report RO -2014 \u2014105 \n<< Page 15 >>\n\
  \ 4.4.17.  Given the factors that likely contributed to the rail protection officer\
  \ 's level of fatigue , a \nrecommendation has been made to the Chief Executive\
  \ of KiwiRail to address the company's \nFitness for Work Policy.     \nFindings\
  \  \n4 It was likely that the rail protection officer was affected by an underlying\
  \ level of \nfatigue and sleep inertia when he made the incorrect assumption that\
  \ the work \nhad been completed and the track was safe for trains to pass over.\
  \   \n5 KiwiRail was not effect ively managing the rail protection officer's day\
  \ -to-day \nworkload , which was likely a factor contributing to an underlying level\
  \ of fatigue at \nthe time of the incident . \n \n \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
