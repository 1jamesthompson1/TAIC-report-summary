    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not explicitly mention a lack of adherence to safety procedures as a contributing factor, but it does imply that the design and installation did not follow the UPS manufacturer's recommendations (4.2.7).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed (4.4, 5.4). This indicates a potential issue with the organizational safety culture.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The Risk Management Policy did not properly consider the safety of passengers and crew for continuity of core services (4.4, 5.4). Additionally, the design did not achieve an appropriate level of redundancy for an essential service (4.3.9).
