- name: Design and Installation of Emergency Power Systems
  explanation: The design and installation of the emergency power systems were critical factors in this accident. The project team responsible for the Auckland train control centralisation project lacked the appropriate expertise for designing and installing the emergency power supply system, which resulted in a single electrical fault causing a power outage to a much wider portion of the system than should have been affected. "Weaknesses in the design and installation of the emergency power distribution system for train control resulted in an electrical fault that should have been detected and contained in one part of the electrical distribution system, causing a power outage to a much wider portion of the system" (5.2). Furthermore, the UPS devices were not designed with redundancy in mind, creating a single point of failure for Auckland's train control (4.3.9).
- name: Risk Management Policy
  explanation: KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy did not adequately consider the safety of passengers and crew for the continuity of core services like train control. The policy was based on freight train operations and did not feature passenger services, which led to an underestimation of the impact of train control failure on passenger safety. "KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy for 'continuity of core services' did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed, causing the widespread stoppage of an entire metropolitan passenger rail system" (5.4).
- name: Circuit Breaker Discrimination
  explanation: The accident highlighted issues with circuit breaker discrimination within the emergency power supply system. The circuit breakers were not installed with the appropriate discrimination between them, which should have isolated the fault to a smaller section rather than affecting all four Auckland workstations. "Without the appropriate discrimination between the two circuit breakers, after a period of less than one second from the initial fault occurring circuit breaker W14 tripped, causing the loss of power to all four Auckland workstations" (4.2.7).
- name: Management and Maintenance of Emergency Power Supply
  explanation: The management and maintenance of the emergency power supply system were insufficient to ensure the integrity of what had been designated an "essential service." There was a lack of familiarity with the operation of the UPS among KiwiRail technicians, no regular test program of the emergency power supply system, and no regular checks of UPS loading or alarm status. "The management and maintenance of the emergency power supply system for train control were not sufficient to ensure the reliability of what had been designated an 'essential service'" (5.5).
- name: UPS Capacity and Redundancy
  explanation: The UPS capacity and redundancy were not properly considered during the design phase, which led to the entire Auckland train control being dependent on a single UPS unit. This lack of redundancy meant that a failure in one part of the system could bring down the entire network. "All four of the Auckland train controller workstations were connected to the same UPS, creating a single point of failure for Auckland's train control" (4.3.9).
- name: Training and Expertise
  explanation: There was a lack of training and expertise among the personnel involved in the project, which contributed to the accident. The KiwiRail engineer who reviewed the electrical design was not familiar with the plan layout format used in the commercial electrical design specifications, and the UPS support technician allocated to the project team left during the design phase without a knowledgeable replacement. "The electrical design was reviewed by a KiwiRail engineer, but he said he was more familiar with line-type diagrams than the plan layout format used in the commercial electrical design specifications, and he did not see any associated UPS load calculations" (4.3.12).
