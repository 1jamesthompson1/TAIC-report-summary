  \ activity that is known to carry an inherent level of risk. \nDuring a tandem -parachuting\
  \ operation in Queenstown, the tandem master experienced \na double malfunction\
  \  with the main and reserve parachute s that resulted in the tandem \npair descending\
  \ uncontrollab ly and striking  the water. The tandem master was rescued \nbut in\
  \ a hypothermic state. The tandem rider was not found .  \n3.2. Available data shows\
  \ that this double malfunction was a rare event. The APF did not have \na specific\
  \ category to record double malfunctions  because they were  so rare. The APF's\
  \ \nAustralian incident data for the five years from 2013 to 2017  showed that an\
  \ average of \n165,000 tandem jumps w ere performed per year. During that five-year\
  \ period , the rate of \nmalfunctions that required deployment of the reserve parachute\
  \ averaged at one per \n1,500 tandem jumps (APF, 2017) .  \n3.3. APF data provided\
  \ to the Commission showed that in the 12 years up to and including \n2017, 112\
  \ reserve  parachute  activations used t he same reserve parachute as used in this\
  \ \naccident. Nineteen of those reserve parachute activations had minor opening\
  \ problems , \nbut six of those opening problems could not be cleared and the incident\
  \ s were \nsubsequently classified as double malfunction s. No fatalities occurred\
  \ in this data set.  \n3.4. New Zealand data from the CAA did not record sufficient\
  \ detail to determine if a reserve \nparachute was deployed during a malfunction\
  \ , and it did not identify the type of reserve \nparachute. CAA d ata in the five-year\
  \ period 2013 -2017  showed an average of 78,000 \ntandem jumps per year with 41\
  \ malfunctions per year. That equates to about one \nmalfunction per 1,900 tandem\
  \ jumps.  \n3.5. The CAA did not record  if a parachute landing was into water .\
  \ The operator stated that \nthis was its first double malfunction and its first\
  \ unintended water landing.   \n3.6. The tandem master continued to support the\
  \ rider in the water. T he video and still image \nrecord s show that the tandem\
  \ master's skill and training assisted the tandem pair 's \nchance s of survival.\
  \ The tandem master remained calm during this accident and kept \ntalking to the\
  \ tandem rider .  \n3.7. This analysis describes what happened during the accident\
  \ and identifies the factors that \ncontributed to each of the malfunctions. It\
  \ also discusses other  safety factors that did not \ncontribute  directly  to the\
  \ outcome but increased risk.  \nWhat happened  \nMain parachute  malfunction  \n\
  3.8. The recorded data showed that the tandem master opened the main parachute at\
  \ about \n5,400 feet  (1,600 m) AGL. The tandem master's v ideo recording showed\
  \ that they were in \na stable attitude but the load came on  to the right risers\
  \ first. This was likely due to the \ncanopy opening on the right side slightly\
  \ before the left side, causing it to turn in a left -\nhand direction while it\
  \ contin ued to inflate. A consequence of the canopy turning was \n \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 24 >>\n that it created a right -hand line twist24. The\
  \ video recording then showed the parachute \ncanopy had opened fully and was flying\
  \ straight but to the south, away from the PLA.  \n3.9. A further consequence of\
  \ the canopy not opening in line with the tandem pair  was that it \ncaused the\
  \ m to spiral around to t heir left. The spiralling movement initially unravelled\
  \ \nthe right -hand line twist , but the tandem pair's momentum continued the rotation.\
  \ As \nthe radius of the spiral decreased , the spin speed increased to one revolution\
  \ per \nsecond , and this resulted in a s evere left -hand line twist.   \n3.10.\
  \ After a few spins toward s the left, the lines and risers twisted. The main parachute\
  \ was \nfully inflated but un -steerable because the brake toggles were locked in\
  \ the twisted risers \nand the parachute was flying further over the lake.  \n3.11.\
  \ The tandem master was able to reduce the number of twists by kicking in the opposite\
  \ \ndirection, but after 34 seconds under the main canopy the tandem master cut\
  \ it away at \nabout 4,800 feet  (1,500 m). This would have likely been  enough\
  \ height for the tandem \npair to reach the PLA on the reserve canopy .  \n3.12.\
  \ A line twist is regarded within the sector as a routine opening problem that can\
  \ be \ncorrected . After  attempts to correct it have been exhausted , it becomes\
  \ a malfunction , \nwhich then  initiates the parachutist's emergency procedures\
  \ to open the reserve \nparachute .  \nCamera operation  \n3.13. Typical p arachuting\
  \ industry procedures require tandem masters to assess  any opening \nproblems immediately\
  \ and then decide if emergency actions are required. The operator's \nstandard operating\
  \ procedures re-emphasised this process  in its instructions to tandem \nmasters\
  \ for when they were using wrist -mounted  cameras .  \n3.14. The tandem master\
  \ in this accident waited for  about  15 seconds while observing the line \ntwist\
  \ and before taking action with both arms. The t andem master stated that , in this\
  \ \ninstance, it was preferable to wait until the line twisting slowed before taking\
  \ action with \nboth arms to avoid getting their ar ms trapped in the twisting risers.\
  \ The tandem master \nstated that they were also shifting their weight in the harness\
  \ (not captured in the vide o) \nto counteract the spin. The t andem master continued\
  \ to hold their left arm out and \nrecord video on  their wrist -mounted camera\
  \ s during this period .   \n3.15. In another of the operator's video records from\
  \ a previous cutaway in 2017, a tandem \nmaster continued to hold their arm out\
  \ and record video using their wrist -mounted \ncamera before taking action with\
  \ both arms. That in cident involved the same type of \nparachute rig but different\
  \ people. These two similar videos raised the possibility of a \nsystemic training\
  \ issue with wrist -mounted cameras.   \n3.16. After this accident, the operator\
  \ took action on this concern of a potential trai ning issue . \nIt revised the\
  \ tandem -master training relating to the use of wrist -mounted cameras . The \n\
  desired result was to ensure that tandem masters focused on resolving any emergency\
  \ \nover and above obtaining video record s of tandem riders ' experience s.  \n\
  \ \n24 The described line -twist direction is relative to the parachutists , so\
  \ a left -turning canopy is the same as \nthe parachutists spinning to their right,\
  \ creating a right -hand twist.  \n\n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 26\
  \ >>\n line much further than normal to slow the spin rate and stall26 the left\
  \ -hand side, then \nrelease it. This cycle continued with the last pull and release\
  \ timed to reduce the speed \nof impact with the surface of the lake.  \n3.21. The\
  \ tandem master instructed the rider to open the lifejacket  container and place\
  \ the \nlifejacket  over the rider's head . This action was completed by approximately\
  \ 2,000 feet  \n(610 m) above the lake.  The operator's normal procedure before\
  \ a water landing was for \nthe tandem master to disconnect both lower passenger\
  \ harness connections.  This would \nprepare them  for separation immediately after\
  \ landing. The tandem master was only able \nto disconnect the lower -right passenger\
  \ harness connection before impact because their \nleft arm was operating the left\
  \ brake line.   \nUnintended  water landing  \n3.22. The tandem pair struck t he\
  \ water while spinning in an almost horizontal , right -side-down  \nattitude .\
  \ A conservative estimate  of the  combined vertical and rotational velocity just\
  \ \nbefore impact was in the range of 50 to 7 0 kilometres per hour. The tandem\
  \ master \nreduced th is slightly  by judicious use of the left brake line.  They\
  \ were submerged during \nthe initial impact and the canopy and suspension lines\
  \ came to rest on top of them. The \nfollowing description is based on the tandem\
  \ master's account and supported by video \nand still imag es recovered from the\
  \  tandem master's  wrist -mounted camera system.  \n3.23. The tandem master recalled\
  \ releasing the rider's harness and pushing the rider towards \nthe surface. The\
  \ reserve parachute lines had become entwined around both the tandem \nmaster's\
  \ and the rider's  legs.  \n3.24. While treading water, with the harness and  reserve\
  \  parachute still attached, the tandem \nmaster dived to clear the parachute lines\
  \ from around the rider's legs. The tandem \nmaster retrieved the hook knife from\
  \ the rider's harness then star ted to cut the lines \nfrom around the rider's feet.\
  \ The tandem master also recalled trying to remove the main \nharness and reserve\
  \ parachute.  \n3.25. The tandem rider could not inflate the lifejacket  by pulling\
  \ the red handle , so the tandem \nmaster tried but was als o unable to inflate\
  \ it. The tandem master then used the manual \ninflation pipe  but could only partially\
  \ inflate  the lifejacket . \n3.26. The tandem master recalled diving again to remove\
  \ the main harness completely and cut \nthe remaining tangled lines from around\
  \ their own  legs.  \n3.27. The tandem master lost sight of the rider after about\
  \ four minutes in the water , then was \nrescued by a small boat  after a total\
  \ of about 13 minutes  of treading water.  \nWhy it happened  \nMain canopy malfunction\
  \  \n3.28. A main canopy malfunction can principally be the result of equipment\
  \ failure , a \nparachutist's actions leading to an unstable opening,  or packing\
  \ problems. In the \nabsence of any equipment failure being identified, the investigation\
  \ considered the \nremaining two possibilities.  \n \n26 The point when the angle\
  \ between the relative airflow into the parachute canopy and the chord of the \n\
  ram-air aerofoil wing section is too great for the wing to maintain full inflation\
  \ pressure. The top and \nbottom sur faces of the canopy may flutter and the sink\
  \ rate will increase . \n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 27 >>\n Unstable\
  \ opening  \n3.29. The operator had recently change d parachuting equipment27. Two\
  \ key differences \nbetween the old and new equipm ent were with the drogue behaviour\
  \ on the \ndeployment of the main parachute and the lack of a pre-set brake setting\
  \ in the new \nmain parachute. As a result of these differences , the new equipment\
  \ required tandem \nmasters  to use a new opening technique. If the  old technique\
  \ were  used  with the new \nequipment , there was a risk of an unstable opening\
  \ , which could lead to a main canopy \nmalfunction . Since changing to the new\
  \ equipment the operator had noticed an increase \nin the rate of main canopy malfunctions.\
  \  \n3.30. With the previous container system, the drop speed remained the same\
  \ as the drogue \nwas released to deploy the main parachute. However, the new container\
  \ system \ncollapsed the drogue chute, which briefly accelerated the tandem pair's\
  \  descent rate \nwhen the drogue was released.   \n3.31. The previous and new main\
  \ canopies performed similarly  when fully inflated , but the \nprevious canopy\
  \ would open to fly at a lower speed with half -brake set , while the new \nmain\
  \ canopy would open and fly at maximum speed without brake .  \n3.32. The combined\
  \ effect of these two differences could accentuate any instability or \nasymmetric\
  \ forces applied to the tandem pair and canopy during the opening sequence \nand\
  \ lead to opening problems. The operator was aware of these differences and had\
  \ \ntrained a ll tandem masters on the correct technique s for the new equipment\
  \ before they \nwere allowed to take commercial passengers.  \n3.33. An analysis\
  \ of t he video recording with the independent industry advisor28 showed the \n\
  tandem pair was in a stabilised attitude at open ing and facing the PLA. Although\
  \ t he \nvideo did not show all the tandem pair 's body movements, the background\
  \ view and t he \nrisers being drawn out cleanly without a twist were  good indicator\
  \ s of their stability.   \n3.34. The video also showed that the right riser loaded\
  \ up first and the tandem pair was swung \nonto their back s and around to their\
  \ left towards the direction in which the main canopy \nwas flying. This showed\
  \ that the tandem pair's  attitude  was unlike ly to have contributed \nto the main\
  \ cano py turning as it inflated.  \nMain parachute packing  problems  \n3.35. There\
  \ are  three possible packing issues  that could induce a line twist : an uneven\
  \ \ndeployment bag, a line dump and an uneven canopy inflation. Of these three \n\
  possibilities, the advisor was unable t o determine which may have been  most likely\
  \  in \nthis accident .  \n3.36. Packers were trained, checked and generally supervised\
  \ while they repack ed main \nparachutes. The workload was shared between the packers\
  \ on duty for the day.  \n3.37. The main canopies were repacked in an open area\
  \ with several parachutes being packed \nsimultaneously , and the packers were under\
  \ time pressure to meet operational demands \nfor the day. On the day of the accid\
  \ ent six packers were on duty and they each repacked \none or two main parachutes\
  \ after each plane load. They had repacked at least 13 main \n \n27 From the 'Strong'\
  \ Dual Hawk tandem container system with the Hop 330 main canopy to the UPT \nMicro\
  \ Sigma container system with Icarus 300 and 330 mains.  \n28 A tandem master and\
  \ parachute techn ician experienced on the Micro Sigma system and the Icarus \n\
  main canopies. (Further details in 9.7 .) \n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page\
  \ 28 >>\n parachutes each by 1300 that day , which is considered to be a high but\
  \ not an excessive \nworkload.  \n3.38. The operator 's packi ng records and incident\
  \ reports were checked for any standout \nrepeat incidents. The packing history\
  \ of the packer who packed the accident parachute \nwas also checked. No evidence\
  \ was found in the operator's records that could have \nsuggest ed any link between\
  \  the packers working that day and the main parachute \nopening with a line twist\
  \ .  \n3.39. The packer should have been tested for drug and alcohol immediately\
  \ after the incident , \nin accordance with the operator's procedures , but was\
  \ not. The operator reported this \nwas because the operator's staff  were engaged\
  \ in the search and rescue operation. The \npacker had passed a test four weeks\
  \ earlier.   \n3.40. After this accident the operator engaged an independent parachute\
  \ technician to check \nthe reserve parachutes and the operator's general packing\
  \ process  (see 3.61 for further \ndetail) . That parachute technician identified\
  \ several potential improvements for the main \nparachute repacking process that\
  \ the operator ha s since implemented . One of these \nrelated to line twists. \
  \ \n3.41. Given the above evidence and the process of elimination, the advisor believed\
  \  that the \npacking likely29 contributed to the asymmetrical main canopy inflation\
  \ , leading to a line \ntwist .  \nReserve canopy malfunction  \nTension -knot formation\
  \  \n3.42. The permanent compression marks found in the two suspension lines in\
  \ the reserve \nparachute were  likely caused by a tension knot. The accident flight\
  \ was the first in which  \nthe rese rve parachute had been deployed. The two compressed\
  \ sections of suspension \nline D4 to Cell 6 shown in  Figure 6 were about 1,300\
  \  millimetres  apart , which coincided \nwith the length of one 'S' fold in the\
  \ free bag's line pouch.  The other line that showed a \nsimilar compression was\
  \ line C5 connected to Cell 8. Both lines passed through the same \ngrommet in the\
  \ rear right of the slider and were therefore likely to have been involved in \n\
  the same tension knot.  \n \n29 See section 11 for expressions of 'probability'.\
  \  \n\n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 30 >>\n operator's  concerns were\
  \ based on three design aspects of the VTC -1 reserve parachute \n(see Figure 11\
  \ ): \n\u2022 it used continuous lines , which increased the bulk of line material\
  \ to be packed  \n\u2022 it used Dacron fibre for the lines. This resulted in a\
  \ thicker line than other materials of \nthe same loading , and the operator believed\
  \ that Dacron lines tended to grip against \nother lines when packed toge ther \n\
  \u2022 the lines were packed into a free bag pouch that was then sealed closed with\
  \ a hook -\nand-loop32 sealing strip across the open end of the line pouch. The\
  \ operator believed \nthat when the lines were  extracted during deployment, they\
  \ were  pulled through the \nline pouch's sealing strip and could fray and catch\
  \ other lines.  \n3.47. The operator stated that it had experienced five malfunctions\
  \ with the VTC -1 reserve \nparachute over several years at its Australian operations\
  \ and that these had resulted  in \nserious injuries. The Australian Civil Aviation\
  \ Safety Authority had approved the \noperator's request to use an alternative manufacturer's\
  \ reserve parachute in the Micro \nSigma container for its operations in Australia.\
  \ The operator stated that since the  change, \nit had had 15 years of trouble -free\
  \ use from its preferred alternative reserve parachute \nand wanted to use the same\
  \ combination in New Zealand.  \n3.48. In mid -2016 t he operator asked the CAA\
  \ flight operations inspector , who was in regular \ncontact, about m aking a similar\
  \ change to its  New Zealand  tandem parachute \nassemblies. Email exchanges and\
  \ meetings on the subject continued between the CAA \nand the operator for a few\
  \ months , but a pathway for that change was not clear to the \noperator. At the\
  \ time of the accident these discussions had not progressed to a formal \napplication\
  \ by the operator to change the reserve parachute in its Micro Sigma tandem \nparachute\
  \ assemblies or its Part 115 exposition.  \n3.49. Civil Aviation Rule  105.51(b)(1)\
  \ requires tandem reserve parac hute assemblies to comply \nwith the technical standards\
  \ of a parachute organisation. In this case, NZPIA's  technical \nstandard deferred\
  \ such decisions o n equipment compatibility between individually \napproved components\
  \ (as is the case when approved to FAA TSO C23b) to a 'parachute \ntechnician' under\
  \ NZPIA rule 19.2.2(4). Therefore, an operator could evaluate the \ncompatibility\
  \ of components in a parachute  assembly using its own parachute \ntechnicians.\
  \ Any change in component s for the parachute assembly would the n require \nformal\
  \ approval from the CAA to revise the Part 115 operator's exposition.  \n3.50. The\
  \ Commission sought accident data to provide a context for the operator's claims\
  \ of \nunreliability. Data was requested from the CAA to compare reserve parachute\
  \ reliabili ty \nlevels  in New Zealand. The CAA data records lacked the detail\
  \ needed to extract \nperformance information on this type of equipment.  \n3.51.\
  \ The Commission also sought the manufacturer's opinion. UPT explained that the\
  \ reserve \nparachute system had undergone substantial testing to achieve its TSO\
  \ compliance \nstatus and that it had been  designed to open safely carrying a tandem\
  \ pair at maximum \npermissible weight falling at terminal velocity free -fall (no\
  \ drogue chute).  The primary \nreason for UPT selecting continuous Dacron lines\
  \ was their performance under such \nextreme opening conditions and the distribution\
  \ of shock loads across the canopy.  \n3.52. UPT s tated that the VTC -1 reserve\
  \ parachute ha d been in service for more than  30 years \nwith proven reliability.\
  \  It compared the operator's claim of five malfunctions with the \n \n32 Often\
  \ refer red to by trade names such as 'Velcro' . \n\n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001\
  \ \n<< Page 32 >>\n most common line type used on tandem main and sport main parachutes\
  \ was Vectran33, \nwhich it also believed was the line type most associated with\
  \ tension knot s. \n3.55. The Commission was unable to determine with any certainty\
  \ if the VTC -1 reserve \nparachute was more susceptible to tension knot s than\
  \ any alternative tandem reserve \nparachute .  \n3.56. UPT advised the Commission\
  \  in January 2021  that it had been working on the des ign \nand testing of a new\
  \ tandem reserve parachute since about 2012. It was released for sale \nin late\
  \ 2020 as the Sigma -II Reserve 340. This new reserve parachute was designed to\
  \ \nhave less packed bulk and to fit into the smaller Micro Sigma container and\
  \ fr ee bag34. \nThe lines are cascaded Vectran rather than Dacron and the reserve\
  \ parachute meets the \ncurrent TSO -C23f standard. UPT discontinued production\
  \ of the VTC -1 (also known as \nthe VR -360) from 8 December 2020.  \nParachutists\
  \ ' attitude at opening  \n3.57. Reserve parachutes are designed to open reliably\
  \ in unusual circumstances, but these \ncircumstances were not unusual. The video\
  \ record showed the tandem pair was \nsuspended vertically and spinning when the\
  \ tandem master cut away the main canopy.  \nThey were descending at sub -terminal\
  \ speed  and the  extraction of the reserve canopy \nfree bag from the parachute\
  \ container was fast. It was  assisted through the Skyhook \nconnection  to the\
  \ rejected main canopy . The tandem master said that the reserve \ndeployme nt was\
  \ clean and symmetrical.   \n3.58. The spinning attitude was more or less likely\
  \ to have affected the lines as they unfurled , \nbut there was no evidence to show\
  \ that it led to the formation of a tension knot . The \nCommission was unable to\
  \ determine with any certainty if the tandem pair's attitude \ninfluenced the formation\
  \ of the tension knots in the reserve parachute 's lines.  \nPacking technique for\
  \ reserve  parachute s \n3.59. The reserve parachute was one of a batch of 62 new\
  \ parachute containers purchased by \nthe operator. Two of its  parachute technicians\
  \ had assembled and packed all of them.  \nThese parachute technicians had trained\
  \ in the USA as master riggers35 but held different \nratings in New Zealand and\
  \ were both experience d with packing reserve parachutes, \nincluding the VTC -1\
  \ reserve.  \n3.60. The Commission, the CAA and the operator random ly selected\
  \ four, packed tandem \nparachute assemblies from the parachute racks to unpack\
  \ and  inspect.  No packing errors \nor concerns with the packing technique s were\
  \ found in this sample of parachute \nassemblies .  \n3.61. The operator subsequently\
  \ brought in another independent parachute technician from a \ncompetitor's operation\
  \ to review its packing operations and another sample of reserve \nparachutes. This\
  \ technician noted that one reserve parachute was found with a 180 -\ndegree twist\
  \ in the rear lines. Th at parachute technician considered that this twist was \n\
  unlikely to cause  a major problem but that it was not acceptable .  \n \n33 A multifilament\
  \ yarn spun from liquid crystal polymer and manufactured by Kuraray.  \n34 The standard\
  \ Sigma container is wider and deeper than the Micro Sigma container. The same VTC\
  \ -1 \nreserve parachute is used in both  containers, but it has to be packed slightly\
  \ differently to fit into the smaller \nfree bag in the Micro Sigma container. \
  \ \n35 Equivalent to master parachute technician in New Zealand.  \n \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 33 >>\n 3.62. As a result of this review, the operator\
  \ made several improvements to its packing \noperations.  \n3.63. The Commi ssion\
  \ contacted the manufacturer of the reserve parachute (UPT) to seek its \nopinion\
  \ on the reserve malfunction. UPT could find no reason for the reserve parachute\
  \ \nnot opening fully. UPT agreed that the canopy distortion was in the right rear\
  \ corner , but \ncould not positively identify why this had occurred.  \n3.64. UPT\
  \ suggested that, although it believed that the reserve parachute had been packed\
  \ \ncorrectly, small changes in packing technique could improve reliability. It\
  \ stated,  \"Tension \nknots, like all parachute  malfunctions, are not 100% preventable.\
  \  A correctly built, \ncorrectly packed, correctly deployed parachute, main or\
  \ reserve, can still malfunction.  \nThat is the nature of parachutes in general\
  \ .\" UPT offered several possible reasons for a \npacking technique to lead to\
  \ a tension knot:  \n\u2022 an uneven or asymmetrical stowage of the reserve parachute\
  \ lines within the free \nbag's line pouch  \n\u2022 free bag line pouch hook -and-loop\
  \ mating inconsistencies across the bag  \n\u2022 the p lacement of the reserve\
  \ risers and the 'fanning ' of the reserve risers in the \nreserve pack36  tray\
  \ during the packing process  \n\u2022 the p lacement of the 'free' reserve lines\
  \ (outside the pouch) in the reserve pack tray \nfrom the reserve risers to the\
  \ reserve free bag  \n\u2022 the orientation of the reserve bag extraction based\
  \ on tandem -pair body position \nduring the reserve deployment.  (The multi -axis\
  \ separation forces between the free \nbag and the tandem pair will vary with the\
  \ spin state of the main canopy being cut \naway. ) \n3.65. After  a reserve parachute\
  \ has been  deployed , it is not possible to ascertain  how it was \npacked , apart\
  \ from through its behaviour on opening. The Commission was unable to \ndetermine\
  \ with any certainty if the way the reserve parachute was packed influenced the\
  \ \nforma tion of the tension knots in the reserve parachute's lines . \nLifejacket\
  \  malfunction  \nSafety issue: The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection\
  \ programme  in place for its \nlifejacket s to ensure they remain ed in a serviceable\
  \ condition . \n  \nSafety issue: The operator expected the tandem master to have\
  \ the reserve parachute pack for \nflotation and therefore did not require them\
  \ to also wear  a lifejacket .  \n3.66. The operator had recognised that the Queenstown\
  \ site posed a risk of unintentional \nparachu te landings in the adjacent lake\
  \ , and after taking ownership had taken steps to \nmitigate that risk. It had purchased\
  \ modified  lifejacket s certified  for use by parachutists \nin Australia and provided\
  \ the m to all tandem riders  (see 2.32 to 2.33 for details on the \nmodification\
  \ ). It had  also conducted water survival training for tandem masters  in late\
  \ \n2017 using the new Micro Sigma container . It also had a rescue plan in place\
  \  for an \nunintended water landing . \n3.67. Although t he modifie d lifejacket\
  \  was a certified  aviation product for parachutists in \nAustralia , it was  not\
  \ certified in New Zealand . Additionally, the modification was not \nauthorised\
  \ by the original manufacturer and the lifejacket no longer conformed with the \n\
  \ \n36 A reserve parachute packed into its compartment in the parachute container.\
  \  \n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 34 >>\n original manufa cturer's TSO\
  \  for its intended use in passenger aircraft . The design \ncompliance stamp stated\
  \ that  it still conform ed with TSO C13f and remained on the front \nof the lifejacket\
  \ . This was misleading , but otherwise the lifejacket was deemed fit by the \n\
  APF for its new  purpose  in the parachuting sector . \n3.68. The APF equipment\
  \ standard required that the lifejacket  be uniquely identified and \nundergo a\
  \ regular maintenance  and inspection programme  to ensure it re mained \nserviceable.\
  \ The New Zealand Civil Aviation Rules  and NZPIA's  rules did not recognise or\
  \ \nendorse the APF standard , nor did they have equivalent requirement s for these\
  \ \nlifejackets  in New Zealand . Consequently, t he CAA rules did not require \
  \ the operat or to \nhave a maintenance  and inspection  programme  for its lifejackets\
  \  at the time  of this \naccident .  \n3.69. While the lifejackets were new,  they\
  \ were in unsealed, zippered pouch es. The greater risk \nwas for the end user s.\
  \ There was no external marking to indicate that the lifejacket s were \nstill in\
  \ a serviceable state before  being  worn  (much like the details  a tandem master\
  \ \nwould check  when conducting a parachute pre-flight  check37). The operator\
  \  has since \nimplemented a main tenance and inspection  programme  to ensure \
  \ that only serviceable \nlifejackets are made available for parachut e descents\
  \ . \n3.70. The tandem master had the option  of wear ing a lifejacket but neither\
  \ the CAA rules nor \nthe operator require d them to do so. The operator had tested\
  \ and proven  that the \nreserve pack  would assist  a tandem master to remain afloat\
  \ , while a tandem rider had \ntheir own lifejacket . If the tandem master chose\
  \ to wear  a lifejacket model used by \ntandem riders , in its p ackaged state it\
  \ would fit  between them . This situation could make \nit more difficult  for a\
  \ tandem master to extract and fit their lifejacket  over their head \nbefore a\
  \ water landing . In this accident, the tandem master deployed the reserve \nparachute\
  \ and therefor e the reserve pack was not able to provide flotation support . \n\
  3.71. The reason for the lifejacket  used on this  parachute descent  not fully\
  \ inflating  could not \nbe conclusively determine d and it has not been  recovered.\
  \  Possible reasons in sequential \norder of occurrence are: a manufacturing fault;\
  \ an empty or loose gas bottle when either \nit was last packed and placed on a\
  \ rack ready for use or , during the descent after being \nfitted on the tandem\
  \ rider; damage upon impact with the water; and damage while in \nthe water.   \n\
  \ \n37 See Civil Aviation Rules 105.109, which lists details for a pre -flight parachute\
  \ check.  \n\n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 36 >>\n experience in water\
  \  landings . Neither parachute organisation requires  its qualified \nparachutist\
  \ members to have assessed skills in actual or simulated water landings. The \n\
  NZPO require s tandem riders to wear lifejacket s if exit or landing area s are\
  \ near water , \nbut the NZPIA just recommend s that  they wear lifejacket s in\
  \ these situations .  \n3.75. Civil Aviation Rule  Part 115 does  not specifically\
  \ require  tandem parachute operator s to \nconsider the key safety factors in maximis\
  \ ing parachutists' chance s of survival after  \nunintended  water landing s, such\
  \ as the likely survival time s for parachutists in  water  and \ntheir rescue .\
  \ However, Part 115 parachute operators do have a non -specific requirement \nunder\
  \ Civil Aviation Rules 115.209 and Part 10038 to identify and manage associated\
  \ risk s \nto their operation.  Part 100 would require operators to have safety\
  \ management system s \nand to identify and manage all relevant hazards . This operator\
  \ still had six months to \nsubmit its draft safety management system to the  CAA\
  \ for review . The CAA planned to \napply the rule to the sector by February 2021.\
  \  \n3.76. In comparison, the  United States Parachute Association  (USPA ) require\
  \ s all advanced \nparachutists (holders of USPA B licences) to complete water -landing\
  \ training as a \nprerequisite to the issue of  their licence s. The USPA also consider\
  \ s the associated risks of \nunintended water landing s and emphasise s in its\
  \ training that a parachutist's survival \nafter an unintended water landing depend\
  \ s on a means of flotation and effecting a \nsuccessful rescue (Daniel, 2015) .\
  \  \n3.77. The Civil Aviation Rule s reference several standards39 for 'life preservers\
  \ ' that are \napproved for use in aircraft40. However, these standards correspond\
  \ with 'life preservers ' \ndesigned for use in aircraft and marine situations ,\
  \ and are not directly applicable for use \nin a parachuting situation  where such\
  \ devices could be hazardous to use .  \n3.78. Lifejackets  used in aircraft  are\
  \ usually stowed in the aircraft until required , but they are \nnot suitable for\
  \ attach ing to parachu te harness es for use by parachutists . Such device s \n\
  worn with parachute harness es are  also subject to harsher operating conditions\
  \ than \nstowed device s. Similarly, n ot all 'personal flotation devices ' made\
  \ in compliance with \nNew Zealand Standard 5823 :200541 would be suitable for use\
  \ in parachuting operations.  \nFor example, Maritime New Zealan d Rules 91.4-Personal\
  \ flotation devices  require \npersonal flotation devices to be worn for commercial\
  \ marine operations.  The associated \nMaritime New Zealand Advisory C ircular AC91\
  \ -2 lists multiple specialist personal \nflotation device types that substantially\
  \ comply with the New Zealand S tandard 5823 for \nspecific water activities.  \n\
  3.79. Civil Aviation Rule Part 105 requires  all parachutists to comply with the\
  \ technical \nstanda rds of a Part 149 parachute organisation. Part 105 specifically\
  \ refers only to \ntechnical standards for parachute equipment and does not mention\
  \ lifejacket s. \nConsequently,  neither of the New Zealand parachute organisations\
  \ has technical \nstandards for suitab le lifejacket s or associated  requirement\
  \ s to ensure such lifejackets \nremain  in a serviceable state.  \n3.80. The NZPIA\
  \ has since reissued its rules and operating procedures to provide more clarity\
  \ \non equipment maintenance and water landings.  \n \n38 Part 100 was in implementation\
  \ phase and was not applicable to the operator at the time of this accident.  \n\

  \ -001 \n<< Page 37 >>\n Survivability  \nSafety i ssue: The operator's planned\
  \ water emergency response did not have due regard to the \nminimum survival time\
  \ for people immersed in cold water . \n3.81. The operator had not experienced a\
  \ water landing previously , but had an emergency \nresponse plan should this occur.\
  \ It included raising the alarm through an air traffic  \ncontroller and the Police\
  \ emergency number. It relied on the harbourmaster and \nQueenstown Coastguard providing\
  \ a waterborne rescue effort.  \n3.82. The operator's pl an did not ensure  parachutists\
  \ were rescued in a time appropriate for \nsurvival in the conditions, nor did it\
  \ have a vessel to implement such a recovery. \nHowever, the plan was an improvement\
  \ on the previous operator's plan for that location , \nand the operato r has since\
  \ provided its own rescue vessel at the aerodrome .  \n3.83. The water temperature\
  \ was about 10\xB0 Celsius , which limited the likely survival time of the \ntandem\
  \ pair . A research report prepared for Transport Canada in 2001 identified four\
  \ \nstages after immer sion in cold water where death can occur (Brooks, 2001) .\
  \ They are , in \norder of severity:  \n1 - cold shock  \n2 - swimming failure \
  \ \n3 - hypothermia  \n4 - post-rescue collapse.  \n3.84. The research report stated\
  \ that the anticipated survival times had usually been based on \na person reaching\
  \ the hypothermic stage, but it is now considered that stages 1 and 2 \nare more\
  \ common causes of death.  Drowning can occur from cold shock affecting the  \n\
  circulatory and respiratory systems within five minutes, followed by loss of dexterity\
  \ \nwithin 30 minutes, leading to an inability to remain afloat. The operator 's\
  \ water \nemergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within\
  \ five minutes of  \ntheir entering the water  at La ke Wakatipu .  \nAccident and\
  \ incident data  \nSafety issue: The CAA dataset for parachut ing occurrences did\
  \ not include key fields, which likely \nreduced its effectiveness as a tool for\
  \ safety management in the sector . \n3.85. The CAA policy on the collection of\
  \ safety information defines its expectations as \nparaphrased below.  \nThe CAA\
  \ has a set of tools  it can deploy to change the attitudes and behaviours \nof\
  \ participants in the civil aviation system. To make these tools effective, the\
  \ CAA \ncollects safety data and information, assesses it and disseminates it \u2026\
  \ The CAA \nwill make a reasonable attempt to veri fy the safety data and information\
  \ supplied \nto it but expects those providing mandatory reports [under Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules \nPart 12  - Accidents, Incidents, and Statistic s] to ensure the data and\
  \ information \ncontained within the reports is accurate  (CAA, 2009) .  \n3.86.\
  \ For a  safety management system to be effective, it needs to be based on a \n\
  comprehensive record of occurrence data . Analyses of that data may identify trends\
  \ and \nenable a safety manager to implement solutions before these t rends result\
  \ in accident s. \nIndividual Part 115 parachute operators are required to manage\
  \ their own occurrence \n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 38 >>\n database\
  \ s and to report occurrences to  the CAA. The data from these reports is then \n\
  entered into the CAA occurrence database  to provide a national resource.  \n3.87.\
  \ However, when the Commission examined the CAA occurrence data, it found it to\
  \ be \nrudimentary and not thorough enough  to identify  some  trends . For example,\
  \ the CAA \ndatabase did not record relevant details about a parachute a ssembly\
  \ even if they were  \nprovided in the parachute operator's Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ Part 12 (Accidents, Incidents, \nand Statistic s) report. Relevant e xamples for\
  \ this accident were : the type of reserve \nparachute; if the reserve parachute\
  \ was activated; how the reserve parachute was \nactivated ; and if the reserve\
  \ parachute opened without problems.   \n3.88. The CAA introduced a dedicated skydiving\
  \ incident -reporting form  after this accident , \nbut it is not included in Civil\
  \ Aviation Rules Part 12 and its use is not described in the \nassociated Advisory\
  \ Circular  AC12 -1. The new form also lacks any fields for the \nequipment details\
  \ of a reserve parachute and AAD or if one had been activated.  The CAA \nsubsequently\
  \ advised , on 16 October 2020, that AC12 -1 was being u pdated to include \nadventure\
  \ aviation reporting . \n3.89. This mismatch between submitted occurrence data from\
  \ operators and a reduced subset \nof data recorded by the CAA was a lost opportunity\
  \ for the CAA to gain national insight s \ninto the safety performance of the parachute\
  \ sector.  \n \n \nFinal Report AO -2018 -001 \n<< Page 39 >>"
