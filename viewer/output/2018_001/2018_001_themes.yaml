- name: Reserve Parachute Malfunction
  explanation: The reserve parachute malfunction is a critical safety theme in this accident. The reserve parachute developed a tension knot during deployment, which the tandem master was unable to clear, leading to a deformed canopy and an uncontrolled descent. "The reserve parachute developed a tension knot as it opened that the tandem master was unable to clear. The tension knot deformed the right rear part of the canopy, and this resulted in the tandem pair descending in a steep, right-hand spiral turn until they struck the water at Lake Wakatipu" (4.3). The cause of the tension knot could not be conclusively determined, highlighting the unpredictability and severity of such malfunctions in parachute operations (4.4).
- name: Inadequate Emergency Response Plan
  explanation: "The operator's emergency response plan did not account for the minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water, making it an important safety theme. \"The operator's plan did not ensure parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for survival in the conditions, nor did it have a vessel to implement such a recovery\" (3.82). The water temperature, which was about 10\xB0 Celsius, limited the likely survival time of the tandem pair, and the operator's water emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of their entering the water at Lake Wakatipu (3.83, 3.84)."
- name: Lifejacket Serviceability and Maintenance
  explanation: The serviceability and maintenance of lifejackets are a safety theme due to the operator's lack of a maintenance and inspection program for lifejackets. "The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets to ensure they remained in a serviceable condition" (4.8). The tandem rider's lifejacket could not be inflated sufficiently to support the rider's head above water, and the reason for the lifejacket not inflating fully could not be conclusively determined (4.6, 4.7).
- name: Parachute Packing Technique
  explanation: The parachute packing technique is a safety theme as it likely contributed to the asymmetric inflation of the main parachute, leading to a line twist and subsequent malfunction. "the main parachute's packing likely contributed to its opening asymmetrically" (4.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The Commission was unable to determine with any certainty if the way the reserve parachute was packed influenced the formation of the tension knots in the reserve parachute's lines (3.65).
- name: Lack of Regulatory Clarity for Water Operations
  explanation: The lack of regulatory clarity for operations near significant bodies of water is a safety theme because the Civil Aviation Rules for parachuting near a significant body of water are not well defined. "The Civil Aviation Rules for parachuting near a significant body of water are not well defined in Part 105" (5.7). This lack of clarity can lead to procedures implemented by Part 115 parachute operators that do not meet minimum levels of safety (5.7).
- name: Data Collection and Reporting for Parachuting Occurrences
  explanation: Data collection and reporting for parachuting occurrences is a safety theme as the CAA dataset for parachuting occurrences did not include key fields, reducing its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector. "The Civil Aviation Authority dataset for parachuting occurrences did not include key fields, which likely reduced its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector" (4.13). The mismatch between submitted occurrence data from operators and the reduced subset of data recorded by the CAA was a lost opportunity for the CAA to gain national insights into the safety performance of the parachute sector (3.89).
