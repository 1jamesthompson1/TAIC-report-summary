- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The tandem master and packers were trained and familiar with the equipment, but the report suggests that the packing of the main parachute likely contributed to the asymmetric inflation and subsequent line twist ("The main parachute 's packing likely42 contributed to its opening asymmetrically" (4.2)). Additionally, the change in parachuting equipment required new techniques for opening the main parachute, which could have contributed to the unstable opening if old techniques were used with the new equipment ("If the old technique were used with the new equipment, there was a risk of an unstable opening, which could lead to a main canopy malfunction" (3.29)).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets, which could have contributed to the lifejacket malfunction ("The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets to ensure they remained in a serviceable condition" (4.8)). This lack of maintenance and inspection could have been a factor in the lifejacket not inflating fully, which was critical for the survival of the tandem rider after the water landing.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The operator's emergency response plan did not ensure parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for survival in the conditions, and it did not have a vessel to implement such a recovery ("The operator's plan did not ensure parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for survival in the conditions" (3.82)). The water temperature limited the likely survival time of the tandem pair, and the operator's water emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of their entering the water at Lake Wakatipu ("The operator 's water emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of their entering the water at Lake Wakatipu" (3.84)).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator had recognized the risk of unintentional parachute landings in the adjacent lake and had taken steps to mitigate that risk, but the measures may not have been sufficient to prevent the accident or ensure the survival of the tandem pair after the water landing ("The operator had recognised that the Queenstown site posed a risk of unintentional parachute landings in the adjacent lake" (3.66)).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's safety culture may not have adequately emphasized the importance of maintenance and inspection of safety equipment, such as lifejackets, which is critical for survival in water landings ("The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets" (4.8)).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The tandem master was only able to disconnect the lower-right passenger harness connection before impact due to their left arm operating the left brake line, which may indicate a deviation from the normal procedure before a water landing ("The tandem master was only able to disconnect the lower-right passenger harness connection before impact because their left arm was operating the left brake line" (3.21)).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The modified lifejacket used was not certified in New Zealand, and the modification was not authorised by the original manufacturer, which may indicate issues with regulatory compliance ("Although the modified lifejacket was a certified aviation product for parachutists in Australia, it was not certified in New Zealand" (3.67)).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The tandem master's decision-making during the emergency, such as the inability to fully inflate the lifejacket, could be attributed to human error under stress ("The tandem master tried but was also unable to inflate it" (3.25)).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The report does not provide specific details on CRM issues, but the tandem master's actions during the emergency, such as attempting to inflate the lifejacket and disconnecting the harness, suggest that CRM may have played a role in the survival efforts ("The tandem master recalled releasing the rider's harness and pushing the rider towards the surface" (3.23)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The tandem master's situational awareness during the parachute descent and water landing may have been a factor in the outcome, as they had to manage the malfunctioning parachute and prepare for an unintended water landing ("The tandem master continued to support the rider in the water" (3.6)).
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue being a factor in the accident within the provided document.

    '
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The use of automation does not appear to be a factor in the accident, as the report does not mention any automated systems contributing to the event.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions do not appear to have directly contributed to the accident, as the report does not mention adverse weather affecting the parachute descent.

- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence in the report of a communication breakdown contributing to the accident.
