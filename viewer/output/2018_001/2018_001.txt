 About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of 
inquiry and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and 
rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and co -ordinating and co -operating with other 
accident investigation organisations overseas.  
The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of 
occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the futu re. It is not the 
Commission's purpose to ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (or to assist an 
agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or agency. However, the 
Commission will not refrain from fully reporting o n the circumstances and factors contributing 
to an accident because fault or liability may be inferred from the findings.

 1 Executive summary  
What happened  
1.1. On 10 January 2018, NZONE Skydive was conducting commercial tandem skydiving 
operations from its Queenstown site  near Lake Wakatipu , when a tandem pair 
experienced a double parachute malfunction.   
1.2. The tandem pair was the last of nine tandem pairs to e xit the aeroplane at 14,000 feet  
(about 4,300 metres)  above the site. The droguefall stage was uneventful and the 
tandem master deployed the main parachute slightly higher than usual in order to reach 
the parachute landing area with ease.  
1.3. The main parachute did not open symmetrically and the lines twisted. After unsuccessfu l 
attempts to correct the line twist , the tandem master cut  away the main parachute and 
deployed the reserve parachute. By this time the tandem pair had drifted further out 
over the lake.  
1.4. The reserve parachute opened , but tension knots in the suspension li nes prevented the 
canopy fully inflating , which  distorted its shape. This  caused the tandem pair  to spin in a 
clockwise direction. The tandem master was unable to overcome the centrifugal forces 
generated by the fast spin rate, which prevented the tandem m aster making a safe 
recovery . The tandem rider donned their lifejacket  for an impending water landing; 
however,  the tandem master did not have a lifejacket . Just prior to impact, the tandem 
master took action to minimise the spin rate and the impact forces expected at the 
moment they struck the surface of the lake.  
1.5. After impact with the water , the tandem master was able to clear the lines entwined 
around both their legs  and assist the tandem rider  to partially inflate the ir lifejacket. 
Attempts to inflate the lifejacket further were unsuccessful . The tandem master was 
rescued after a short period of time , but the tandem rider was not found and remains 
lost in the lake . 
Why it happened  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that t he 
asymmetric opening of the main parachute canopy and subsequent line twist were  likely 
due to the way the main parachute had been  packed . The cause of the tension knot 
forming in the su spension lines of the reserve parachute could not be conclusively 
determined.  
1.7. The tandem rider's lifejacket  likely  could not be inflated sufficiently to support the ir head 
above water. The reason for the lifejacket  not inflating fully and its state of serv iceability 
before it was used could not be conclusively determined.  In addition, the tandem master 
was not equipped with a lifejacket , which decreased their ability to remain afloat.  
1.8. The Commission also found that the operator's planned water emergency res ponse did 
not have due regard to the minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water. 
This increased the likelihood of the water emergency response not providing timely 
assistance.  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 7 >>
 What we can learn  
1.9. The Commission considered several aspects  of this  accident to be safety issue s that had 
the potential to affect other parachut ing activities  in New Zealand:  
• maintenance program mes ensure that equipment is airworthy and able to perform its 
function s when required. The operator's lack of a maintenance  and inspection  
program me for lifejacket s introduced a risk to the operation  
• rules and operating procedures are put in  place to ensure a basic level of operational 
safety is achieved.  If this guidance is not well defined, organisations that are required 
to comply may not achieve consistent or desired outcome s. The Civil Aviation Rules  
did not clearly define the minimum safety requirements for tandem parachute 
descents  being  conducted near significant bod ies of water. This resulted in 
inconsistencies between  the parachuting entities guided by the Civil Aviation Rules 
such as  parachute organisations and Part 115 parachute operations , and increased the 
risk to parachutists  
• standards are in place for emergency equipment to ensure it meets a set of minimum 
requirements. The standards referenced in the Civil Aviation Rules for lifejacket s did 
not consider the specific requirements for parachuting . There is a risk that products 
certified to these standard s will not be suitable for parachuting conditions  
• emergency response plans ensure that timely assistance can be provided in an 
emergency. These plans need to consider the likely environment s in which 
emergen cies will occur. In not adequately considering th e minimum survival time s for 
people immersed in cold water, there was a risk that any water emergency response 
by the operator would not be able to provide timely assistance  
• effective safety management in the entire parachute sector relies on the assessment 
of occurrence data. Without key fields being recorded  by the Civil Aviation Authority 
for parachute occurrences  that include the equipment fitted to the parachute s, the 
effectiveness of  this tool for  safety management in the sector is reduced.  
1.10. Since this accident t he operator has made several improvements to its policy and 
procedures regarding the safety issues identified . As such, no recommendations have 
been  made to address those issues.   
1.11. The Commission made two recommendation s to the Secretary  for Transport  and one to 
the Director of Civil Aviation : 
• the Commission recommends that the Secretary for Transport review and revise Civil 
Aviation Rule Parts 105 (Parachuting Operating Rules) , Part 115 (Adventure Aviation  
Certification and Operation s) and Part 149 (Aviation Recreation Organisations 
Certification)  for parachuting  operations , in conjunction with the  Part 149 
organisations ' operating procedures and standards, to reduce the potential ly adverse  
consequence s of an unintended water landing  
• the Commission recommends that the Secretary for Transport review  and revise Civil 
Aviation Rule Parts 105, 115 and 149 for parachuting  operations , in conjunction with 
the Part 149 organisations ' operating procedures and standar ds, to define flotation 
devices that are  suitable for use by parachutists  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 8 >>
 • the Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation review the parachute 
accident and incident reporting system under Civil Aviation Rules Part 12  (Accidents, 
Incidents, and Statistic s) and Advisory Circular AC12 -1 (Mandatory occurrence 
notification and informatio n), in conjun ction with the Part 115 parachute operations 
and Part 149 organisations ' requirements , to provide a more effective national 
resource to manage the sector's safety .  
1.12. The key lesson identified from the inquiry was that if a parachute operation is based near 
a significant body of water, the operator needs to consider and mitigate the additional 
risks presented by a parachut ist unintentionally  landing in the water.   
1.13. All parachutists would benefit from gain ing practical or simulated experience s of a water 
landin g before being issued with their initial parachutists ' certificate s. 
1.14. All parachute -sector participants may benefit from continued engagement with each 
other to improve industry guidance and the safety of parachuting in New Zealand.  
Who may benefit  
1.15. Parachutists, tandem riders , operators , parachute organisations  and the New Zealand 
adventure tourism industry  will benefit from this report.

 2 Factual information  
Narrative  
2.1. On 10 January 2018, NZONE Skydive ( the operator ) was conducting commercial tandem 
skydiving operations from its Queenstown site at Jardines aerodrome  (the aerodrome ). 
The aerodrome is  located about seven kilometres south of Queenstown Airport  near 
Lake Wakatipu  (the lake) .  
2.2. The parachute -drop  aeroplane , registered ZK -KPH (the aeroplane), departed at 13161. On 
board was one pilot  (the pilot)  and 18 passengers consisting of nine tandem pairs.  Each 
tandem pair consisted of a tandem master and a tandem passenger  (rider) . 
2.3. The pilot climbed the aeroplane to 15,000 feet  (4,600 metres  [m]) altitude  above mean 
sea level2 to commence the jump run  in a southerly direction above  the parachute 
landing area (PLA)  at the aerodrome . The accident pair was the last tandem pair  to exit 
the aeroplane , at 1332 .  
2.4. The tandem pair's initial drogu efall3 descent was uneventful . At about 5,400 feet (1,600 
m) above ground level ( AGL), the tandem master deployed the main parachute , which 
opened fully but was facing approximately 120 degrees to the left of the tandem pair's 
heading. This resulted in their spiralling , then their spinning anticlockwise below the 
canopy  and the parachute lines twist ing. The tandem master was unable to clear the line 
twist . At approximately 4,800 feet (1,500 m) AGL, the tandem master performed a 
'cutaway '4 of the main par achute then deploy ed the reserve  parachute  at 1334 . 
2.5. The right -hand side of the reserve parachute did not open properly , which caused the 
tandem pair to  enter a  clockwise spin (see Figure 3 ). The tandem master was unable to 
correct the problem , but was able to reduce the spin rate intermittently by pulling  down 
on the left brake line  to well beyond the normal control movement .  
 
1 Times are in New Zealand daylight time (co -ordinated universal time + 13 hours) and expressed in the 
24-hour format .  
2 Note that all vertical distances  in this report are referenced to sea level unless marked otherwise. 
Jardines aerodrome is approximately 1,000 feet  (305 m) altitude  above mean sea level . Parachutists work 
in heights above the ground level at the landing point, so the drop heights are ref erenced above ground 
level.  
3 The portion of a tandem descent  when a drogue has been deployed.  It occurs between the initial 
freefall and the main parachute deployment . A drogue is a trailing 'parachute -looking' device used to 
create drag and regulate the fall rate of a tandem pair .

 Search and rescue  
2.11. Ground safety observers at the PLA raised the alarm after observing the reserve 
parachute  deploy ing. When they realised that the tandem master was unable to control 
the reserve parachute and that it was descending over the lake , the operator activated its 
water rescue plan.  
2.12. The first stage of that plan was to confirm that the tandem pair was going to land in the 
lake. The radio operator  contact ed the pilot  of the skydive aeroplane to advise  that a 
tandem pair had deployed their reserve parachute and were  likely to land  in the lake. The 
pilot divert ed the aeroplane  to search for the tandem pair . The pilot observed the reserve 
parachute and tandem pair  in the water  and transmitted a 'PAN-PAN'6 radio call  to 
Queenstown air traffic control . The pilot requested  that Queenstown air traffic control 
contact the harbour master  for immediate assistance.  
2.13. The harbour master dispatched the Coast guard Queenstown boat and requested 
assistance from other boat operators .  
2.14. By chance , a helicopter pilot working nearby at Cecil Peak Station , across the lake from 
the operator's base,  heard the PAN-PAN call and offered to assist . The helicopter  pilot 
transported  the Cecil Peak Station manager  to where a boat was moored , then flew to 
the parachute  and hovered above to mark that location .  
2.15. The Cecil Peak Station manager launched the boat and reached  the parachute  at 1349. 
After retrieving the tandem master from the water, the y continued to search for the rider.  
At 1405 the tandem master was transferr ed to another boat and taken ashore , then to 
hospital by  rescue helicopter.  
2.16. The operator conducted a n aerial search for the rider , then at about 1430 Coast guard 
Queenstown arrived and took control of the marine search. The search was called off at 
1642. An underwater search by New Zealand  Police a few days later was unable to find 
the tandem rider ; they remain lost.

 Survival aspects  
2.19. The water temperature was approximately 10 º Celsius and the surface was calm with a 
five-knot7 southerly wind.  By 1500 the wind had increased to about 12 knot s and the 
surface was choppy with white caps.  
2.20. During the descent under the spinning reserve parachute, t he rider verbally confirmed to 
the tandem master that the rider could  swim. The tandem master had significant 
swimming experience , including through parachuting into water  and scuba diving , and 
as a lifeguard.   
2.21. The operator's water rescue  plan relied on a response  from the harbourmaster and the 
coastguard in Queenstown. The Cecil Peak Station manager and crew arrived first on the 
scene in their boat , about 13 minutes after the tandem pair entered  the water.  The first 
of the planned responders arrived from Queenstown about 30 minutes  after the tan dem 
pair struck the water .  
Equipment  
Parachute assembly  
2.22. The parachute assembly8 was identified by the operator's numbering system as rig9 C46 
and by the Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  (CAA)  registration system as 31Z. The 
parachute assembly was a combination of  components  that broadly consisted of three 
main items  (see Appendix 2 and the Sigma Tandem manual (UPT Vector, 2019)  for more 
details  of the components ): 
• the container  - complete with harnesses, the main drogue chute, the reserve pilot 
chute, control handles and the automatic activation device (AAD)10 
• the reserve  parachute  - complete with lines   
• the main parachute  - complete with lines . 
2.23. The components had initially been packed into the parachute assembly on 6 October 
2017 . Since then the parachute assembly had been used for 341 jumps .  
2.24. The operator's parachute technicians11 inspected each tandem parachute assembly and 
repacked the main parach utes on a monthly cycle. The parachutes were  usually collected 
for these inspection s while they were unpacked , immediately after use , then placed back 
into service after the inspection s had been  completed. The previous  monthly inspections 
for the accident  parachute assembly had been  on 7 December 2017 and  again on  8 
January 2018 .  
 
7 A measurement of speed in nautical miles per hour, equivalent to 1.85 kilometres per hour . 
8 Any parachute and its associated harness, container system and other component parts for use by 
people.  
9 An alternative industry term  for a parachute assembly . 
10 A safety backup device fitted inside a parachute container that monitors the parachutist's height 
above ground and descent rate and that will automatically deploy the reserve parachute if specific 
conditions are exceeded . 
11 People  who have  been checked as being competent in maintaining parachute equipment and issued 
with parachute technician licence s.

 Main parachute  
2.25. The main parachute was an Icarus Tandem, manufactured in New Zealand in 2017 by NZ 
Aerosports  Limited. The canopy  was a  mildly  elliptical, nine-cell, ram-air style made with 
a zero-porosity12 fabric with a surface area of 300 square feet  (sqft) (28 square metres  
[m2]). It had HMA13 1200 , black suspension  lines and a maximum  rated load of 227  
kilograms  (kg).  
2.26. The main parachute had last been inspected and repacked as described above on 8 
January 2018.  On the day of the accident the parachute  assembly had been used four 
times and  the main parachute  repacked three times.  
Reserve parachute  
2.27. The reserve  parachute  was a model VTC -1, manufactured in the United States of America 
(USA) for Uninsured United Parachute Technologies , LLC (UPT) . It had been  
manufactured under contract  to UPT by Performance Design s, Inc in May 2017  in 
accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  Technical Standard Order  
(TSO)  C23b (FAA TSO C23b) . The Performance Design s model was a Vector Tandem II.  
2.28. The canopy  was a square -wing , nine-cell, ram-air design  made with F111 ripstop woven 
fabric . It had  three centre cells without crossports14 and open stabilisers connected to the 
outer line attachment points. It was fitted with Dacron15 continuous (non-cascaded)16 
lines.  The parachute size was 360 sqft (33 m2) and it had a maximum rated load of 227 
kg.  
2.29. The reserve parachute was just over  six months old. It had initially been assembled and 
packed into the parachute assembly on 6 October 2017 by the operator's parachute 
technician . The next inspection and repack as required by the Civil Av iation  Rules17 was 
not due until May 2018 . The reserve parachute had never been deployed . 
Container  
2.30. The container  and harness system was a  Micro Sigma, manufactured in the USA by UPT, 
also in accordance with  FAA TSO C23b .  
2.31. The harness  was attached to the tandem master , and the tandem rider wore a separate 
passenger harness (see details of the harness and container in Appendix 2) . The tandem 
rider's harness was attached to the tandem master's harness at four attachment points. A 
hook knife to cut lines in an emergency was stowed in a pouch on the rear of the 
tandem rider's harness for easy access  by the tandem master . 
Lifejacket  
2.32. The lifejacket  used by the rider was a Switlik model AV -200 (see Figure 5 ) that had 
originally been designed for commercial aircraft passengers and manufactured to FAA

 TSO C13F . This lifejacket  was modified  by Air Safety Solutions  Pty Ltd  (Australia) 
specifically for use by parachutists  in Australia under the authority of the Australian Civil 
Aviation Safety Authority Technical Standard  Order ATSO -1C13 , and in accordance with  
Australian Parachute Federation  (APF)  equipment standard APF071206 -I. 
 
2.33. The modification removed a whistle and light and changed the container from a sealed 
plastic bag to a waist -mounted zipped bag. This enabled the lifejacket  to be fitted on the 
front of the tandem rider with a belt.  
2.34. The lifejacket  had a single inflatable cell that was inflated by pu lling a red handle 
attached to a mini -inflator. The action of pulling on the handle normally pierce d the 
membrane of a small , compressed -gas cylinder  that was screwed to the mini -inflator.  
The compressed gas then vented into the lifejacket cell. A separate  red mouthpiece was 
provided for additional manual inflation.  
Equipment inspection  
2.35. A detailed inspection was carried out o f the parachute assembly and  the following were  
noted : 
• the reserve static line18 remained attached to the right main harness. It could be 
disconnected by the tandem master to allow the main canopy to be cut away without 
deploying the reserve  parachute . This is a required action for some malfunctions  
where there is a risk of a reserve parachute becoming entangled with a rejected main  
parachute  
• the AAD had not activate d. It would only have activate d if the tandem pair 's descent 
rate and heights had met the trigger threshold set in the AAD  (see 2.45) 
 
18 A connection between the main risers and the reserve activation system intended to initiate reserve 
activation following the release of a deployed main parachute  (a cutaway).

<< Page 16 >>
 • the loaded rib wall19 in the reserve canopy between Cell 9 and Cell 7 (the two outer 
left-hand  cells) and the non-loaded  rib wall in Cell 9 had ripped apart . These ribs each 
had two crossports  to equalise the cell pressure and help inflate the canopy from the 
central cells towards the outer edges. The ribs had ripped through almo st the fu ll 
chord20 length  of the rib at the weakest point, across the centre of the two crossports  
• eleven  reserve parachute suspension lines (see Appendix 2, Line Trim Chart) had been  
cut: Cell 1 left-hand side  - B1; Cell 1 right -hand side  - A1 and B1 ; Cell 2  - A2 and B2 ; 
Cell 3 - B2 and C2 ; Cell 4 - A3 and B3 ; Cell 6 - A4; and Cell 8 - A5 
• two reserve parachute suspension lines  to the two outer right -hand cells  had 
permanent compression marks in three localised spots  (line D4 to Cell 6 and li ne C5 to 
Cell 8 , shown in  Figure 6) . The suspension lines were new and the fibre weave was 
loose from not having been under tension before , so the localised compression marks 
were visually differen t from the rest of the suspension lines . No other lines had similar 
marks. These compression marks were consistent with the pressure that could be 
exerted by a tension knot. These lines connected to  the rear right -hand side of the 
canopy  and passed through the same eyelet in the slider21 (see Figure 7 )

 Tandem  parachut e descent   
2.36. In an uneventful  tandem  parachute descent, a fter exiting an aeroplane the tandem 
master deploy s the drogue  chute to reduce the descent rate. P rior to 5,000 feet (1,500 m) 
AGL, the drogue chute is release d using the drogue release knob. This open s the 
parachute container  and withdraw s the main parachute  in its deployment bag to unpack 
the lines  (see Figure 7 and Appendix 2 ). When the lines are extended , the deployment 
bag is withdrawn from around the packed  canopy. The canopy inflate s from the centre 
outwards. The slider control s the rate of inflation , and in doing so  reduce s the  opening 
shock loads on the tandem pair . The slider slides  down the lines as the canopy is inflated , 
to sit above the risers.  
2.37. When the main canopy opens , the tandem pair  normally transition s from a horizontal to 
an upright  position . Under normal conditions the parachute opens and  the tandem  pair 
continue s to descend at a gentle rate. The forward airspeed and di rection are controlled 
by the tandem master until landing . 
Parachute opening problems and m alfunctions  
2.38. Parachute s will often open correctly , but parachutists may experience opening problems. 
Parachutists are trained to check for problems when their parachute s open and take 
immediate action to resolve them. Two common types of opening problems are line 
twists and tension knots.  
2.39. A line twist occurs when suspension lines attaching  a parachute har ness to a canopy 
become twisted.  Recovery techniques usually involve the parachutist kicking in the 
opposite direction, pulling the risers apart  or using the forward air speed to assist with 
untwisting the lines, or a combination of the three . 
2.40. A tension kn ot occurs when one or more of the suspension lines form a loop that 
catches and develops into a knot as the line tension increases when the canopy inflates. 
The tension knot effectively shortens all lines caught up in it and can deform the canopy. 
Recovery  techniques involve temporarily removing the tension from the line . One 
method of doing this involves pulling down on the knotted lines  to shorten them and 
distort the canopy , then releas ing them. As they relax , the tension grip in the knot is 
released and  the canopy inflates  fully. 
2.41. If an opening problem is unable to be corrected , it becomes a malfunction  and the 
parachutist initiates the emergency procedure to open the reserve parachute . A tandem 
master can cut away  the main parachute by pulling the cutaway handle  on the right main 
riser. This releases both the right and the left main parachute  risers and allows the 
tandem pair to fall away from the rejected main canopy.   
2.42. A reserve static line  connected to the departing right main parachute  riser then releases 
the reserve pilot chute , which deploys the reserve parachute. This reserve static line can 
be manually disabled at the right riser if the parachutist needs to separate from the main 
canopy and deploy the reserve parachute manually later.  
2.43. Two other devices are connected to the re serve static line.  The first is a  backup  device 
called a 'Collins Lanyard '. This device ensures  that the left main parachute riser is also 
released  with the right riser . The second device is a 'Skyhook '. A lanyard is connected 
from the reserve static line to a Skyhook  on the bridle of the reserve pilot chute.  The 
Skyhook's  purpose is to use the rejected main canopy to withdraw the reserve parachute

 2.48. The tandem master held ratings for other parachute systems, and had undert aken  a full 
conversion -training  cours e for the Micro Sigma system with the operator in 2017.  
2.49. At the time of the accident the tandem master had conducted approximately  4,000 
parachute descents , including 2,500 as a tandem master . Their New Zealand experience 
with the operator had included appr oximately 550 tandem  jumps , with 206 of those 
being in the previous  three weeks.  
2.50. The tandem master recalled experiencing roughly six main canopy cutaway s and reserve  
parachute  deployments during their career , but none with the Micro Sigma rig.  
2.51. The tandem master 's ratings , qualifications and medical certificate were current and 
appropriate for conducting ta ndem parachute operations.  
2.52. The tandem master had c ompleted and passed pre-employment drug and alcohol 
testing. The operator did not conduct a post -incident test on this tandem master , 
although it was standard procedure. Post-incident testing would have been  a urine or 
breath test , but as the tandem master was treated by paramedics at the edge of the lake 
then hospitalised , the operator did not condu ct these tests . A urine test was conducted 
three days later with negative (clear) results.  
Organisational and management information  
2.53. The operator had recently purchased the tandem skydiving operation , which had 
operations at Queenstown , Wanaka  and Glenorchy . The operator was in the process of 
amalgamating the three operations  into one organisation . A change to a standard jump 
aircraft and tandem parachute rig was part of that process.  The parent company was an  
Australian skydive operator with severa l operations in Australia.  
2.54. The operator was certificated under Civil Aviation Rules Part 115 (Adventure Aviation - 
Certification and Operations) as an Adventure Aviation Operation , and had nominated 
the NZPIA as its Part 149 parachute organisation  (the term used in this report to describe 
organisations that have Aviation Recreation Organisations Certification  issued in 
accordance  with Civil Aviation Rules Part 149 ). 
Meteorological information  
2.55. According to  the weather condi tion report fo r Queenstown Airport at the time of the 
accident : 
• the surface wind was 10 knots from the south  
• the wind at 2 ,000 feet (610 m) was five knots and variable in direction  
• there was a  broken layer of cloud at 5,000  feet (1,500 m) 
• the visibility was 40 kilometres   
• the temperature was 18º Celsius  
• the dew point was 12º Celsius . 
2.56. The wind at the drop height of 15,000 feet  (4,600 m) was approximately 15 knots from 
the southwest , and at about the parachute  opening height  of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) AGL it 
was appro ximately five knots from the north west.

 Regulatory structure  
2.57. The CAA set the organisation structure  for the rules  to conduct skydiving operations  (see 
Appendix 1) . There are several references to common Civil Aviation Rule s parts , but only 
three princip al parts govern these operations : 
• Part 105 - Parachuting Operating Rules  
• Part 149 - Aviation Recreation Organisations Certification  
• Part 115 - Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations . 
Part 105 - Parachuting - Operating Rules  
2.58. An individual parachutist  must meet the minimum requirements to participate in the 
activity as defined in Civil Aviation Rule s Part 105 , and must also belong to a 'parachute 
organisation' that has an 'Aviation Recreation O rganisation  Certificate' issued in 
accordance with Part 149 .  
Part 149 - Aviation Recreation Organisations - Certification  
2.59. A parachute organisation sets the minimum standards for equipment, operations and 
competency for all parachute activities that its members conduct.  
2.60. In accordance with Civil Aviation Rule s Part 149 , parachute  organisations are delegated 
by the Director of Civil Aviation  to assess or review the competenc y of individuals for the 
issue and renewal of certificates authorising those individuals to carry out specific 
functions wi thin the sector , for example commercial parachutist certificate, tandem 
master and parachute technician. They can also have their own operating procedures 
and standards in addition to the minimum requirements of Civil Aviation Rule  Part 105 .  
2.61. Currently two parachute  organisations exist in New Zealand , but the Civil Aviation Rules  
allow others to be approved . The two in operation at the time of the accident were the 
NZPIA and the N ew Zealand  Parachute Organisation  (NZPO) .  
 Part 115 - Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations  
2.62. A Civil Aviation Rule  Part 115 parachute operation is set up specifically to conduct 
commercial tandem -parachute operations . The operator  must become a certificated 
'Adventure Aviation Operation ' and obtain an operating certificate issued in accordance 
with Part 115.  They must  also have their own operating and maintenance procedures , 
which must embody the conditions in Civil Aviation Rule Part 105 and the rules of the 
Part 149 organisation to which  they subsc ribe. 
Recorded data  
2.63. The tandem master had a dual GoPro camera  mounted on their left wrist , which was for 
commercial purposes . One camera was set to record video at 50 frames per second  with 
audio and the other still photo graph s at one per second . The tandem master restarted 
both cameras while still in the skydive aeroplane and they recorded the complete 
parachute descent. Both cameras  were recovered  and the media files downloaded. Due 
to a missing memory card cover, the GoPro video camera stopped recording soon after 
impact with the water. The still camera remained watertight and kept operating until the 
rescuers turned it off.  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 22 >>
 2.64. The tandem master wore a separate wrist -mounted electronic altimeter . This device  
record ed up to 10 min utes of the last jump data with timing, vertical speed and altitude . 
It also recorded an electronic log book of the past 200 jumps with data on the date and 
time, a jump number with exit height, freefall time, main canopy deployment height and 
under -canopy  time.  The device did not have a facility to download  data to an external 
system , but a video record was made of the last jump replay , and the recent jump data 
was manually recorded .  
2.65. The tandem master had an audible altitude -alerting altimeter fitted in the lining of the ir 
helmet. This altimeter had alerts set at 6,500 feet, 5,500 feet and 4,500 feet (2,000, 1,700 
and 1,400 m) AGL. 
2.66. The AAD continuously monitored the height above the ground and the descent rate. It 
was set to record  when the desc ent speed exceeded 115 feet (35 m) per second  and to 
stop 24 seconds after the descent speed dropped below that threshold. The saved record 
also include d the seven seconds before the start point. Multiple records or an extended 
record could be created  during a single parachute drop if the de scent speed exceeded 
the AAD threshold again after the main canopy had been  cut away .  
2.67. The AAD was sent to the New Zealand agent for data download . Three jump records 
were recovered from the accident flight23. An analysis of these records showed that the 
first of the three jump records (number 343) accurately matched the descent to when the 
main parachute opened and continued for 24 seconds  (see Appendix 3) .  
2.68. The recorded data from the last two records indicated a par achute descent that would 
have been  physically impossible . Record 344 showed the tandem pair climbing at more 
than 300 feet (91 m) per second and descending to 1 ,200 feet (366 m) below ground. 
The last record , number 345, showed the tandem pair climbing and descending between 
1,000 and 2 ,000 feet (305 and 610 m) below ground at speeds of up to 200 feet (61 m) 
per second in both directions. The last two records were  considered by the manufacturer 
to be erroneous data likely  due to the crash impact and the AAD being submerged in the 
lake. 
2.69. The aeroplane was monitored by secondary radar and tracked in controlled airspace by a 
Queenstown air traffic controller. Electronic records of the aircraft track and radio and 
telephone com munications with the tower controller were obtained from Airways New 
Zealand.  
Tests and research  
2.70. All the recovered equipment was initially inspected in Queenstown by the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) investigators with the assis tance of the 
NZPIA safety director . A further inspection was carried out by the CAA and the operator's 
parachute technician, under the supervision of the Commission investigators . 
2.71. A detailed inspection of all the equipment was later conducted at the Commission's 
technical facility.  
2.72. An experienced tandem master and parachute technician, independent of the operator, 
was engaged to assist the Commission in inspect ing and analys ing the evidence.

 3 Analysis  
Introduction  
3.1. Parachuting is an adventure activity that is known to carry an inherent level of risk. 
During a tandem -parachuting operation in Queenstown, the tandem master experienced 
a double malfunction  with the main and reserve parachute s that resulted in the tandem 
pair descending uncontrollab ly and striking  the water. The tandem master was rescued 
but in a hypothermic state. The tandem rider was not found .  
3.2. Available data shows that this double malfunction was a rare event. The APF did not have 
a specific category to record double malfunctions  because they were  so rare. The APF's 
Australian incident data for the five years from 2013 to 2017  showed that an average of 
165,000 tandem jumps w ere performed per year. During that five-year period , the rate of 
malfunctions that required deployment of the reserve parachute averaged at one per 
1,500 tandem jumps (APF, 2017) .  
3.3. APF data provided to the Commission showed that in the 12 years up to and including 
2017, 112 reserve  parachute  activations used t he same reserve parachute as used in this 
accident. Nineteen of those reserve parachute activations had minor opening problems , 
but six of those opening problems could not be cleared and the incident s were 
subsequently classified as double malfunction s. No fatalities occurred in this data set.  
3.4. New Zealand data from the CAA did not record sufficient detail to determine if a reserve 
parachute was deployed during a malfunction , and it did not identify the type of reserve 
parachute. CAA d ata in the five-year period 2013 -2017  showed an average of 78,000 
tandem jumps per year with 41 malfunctions per year. That equates to about one 
malfunction per 1,900 tandem jumps.  
3.5. The CAA did not record  if a parachute landing was into water . The operator stated that 
this was its first double malfunction and its first unintended water landing.   
3.6. The tandem master continued to support the rider in the water. T he video and still image 
record s show that the tandem master's skill and training assisted the tandem pair 's 
chance s of survival. The tandem master remained calm during this accident and kept 
talking to the tandem rider .  
3.7. This analysis describes what happened during the accident and identifies the factors that 
contributed to each of the malfunctions. It also discusses other  safety factors that did not 
contribute  directly  to the outcome but increased risk.  
What happened  
Main parachute  malfunction  
3.8. The recorded data showed that the tandem master opened the main parachute at about 
5,400 feet  (1,600 m) AGL. The tandem master's v ideo recording showed that they were in 
a stable attitude but the load came on  to the right risers first. This was likely due to the 
canopy opening on the right side slightly before the left side, causing it to turn in a left -
hand direction while it contin ued to inflate. A consequence of the canopy turning was 
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 24 >>
 that it created a right -hand line twist24. The video recording then showed the parachute 
canopy had opened fully and was flying straight but to the south, away from the PLA.  
3.9. A further consequence of the canopy not opening in line with the tandem pair  was that it 
caused the m to spiral around to t heir left. The spiralling movement initially unravelled 
the right -hand line twist , but the tandem pair's momentum continued the rotation. As 
the radius of the spiral decreased , the spin speed increased to one revolution per 
second , and this resulted in a s evere left -hand line twist.   
3.10. After a few spins toward s the left, the lines and risers twisted. The main parachute was 
fully inflated but un -steerable because the brake toggles were locked in the twisted risers 
and the parachute was flying further over the lake.  
3.11. The tandem master was able to reduce the number of twists by kicking in the opposite 
direction, but after 34 seconds under the main canopy the tandem master cut it away at 
about 4,800 feet  (1,500 m). This would have likely been  enough height for the tandem 
pair to reach the PLA on the reserve canopy .  
3.12. A line twist is regarded within the sector as a routine opening problem that can be 
corrected . After  attempts to correct it have been exhausted , it becomes a malfunction , 
which then  initiates the parachutist's emergency procedures to open the reserve 
parachute .  
Camera operation  
3.13. Typical p arachuting industry procedures require tandem masters to assess  any opening 
problems immediately and then decide if emergency actions are required. The operator's 
standard operating procedures re-emphasised this process  in its instructions to tandem 
masters for when they were using wrist -mounted  cameras .  
3.14. The tandem master in this accident waited for  about  15 seconds while observing the line 
twist and before taking action with both arms. The t andem master stated that , in this 
instance, it was preferable to wait until the line twisting slowed before taking action with 
both arms to avoid getting their ar ms trapped in the twisting risers. The tandem master 
stated that they were also shifting their weight in the harness (not captured in the vide o) 
to counteract the spin. The t andem master continued to hold their left arm out and 
record video on  their wrist -mounted camera s during this period .   
3.15. In another of the operator's video records from a previous cutaway in 2017, a tandem 
master continued to hold their arm out and record video using their wrist -mounted 
camera before taking action with both arms. That in cident involved the same type of 
parachute rig but different people. These two similar videos raised the possibility of a 
systemic training issue with wrist -mounted cameras.   
3.16. After this accident, the operator took action on this concern of a potential trai ning issue . 
It revised the tandem -master training relating to the use of wrist -mounted cameras . The 
desired result was to ensure that tandem masters focused on resolving any emergency 
over and above obtaining video record s of tandem riders ' experience s.  
 
24 The described line -twist direction is relative to the parachutists , so a left -turning canopy is the same as 
the parachutists spinning to their right, creating a right -hand twist.  

 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 26 >>
 line much further than normal to slow the spin rate and stall26 the left -hand side, then 
release it. This cycle continued with the last pull and release timed to reduce the speed 
of impact with the surface of the lake.  
3.21. The tandem master instructed the rider to open the lifejacket  container and place the 
lifejacket  over the rider's head . This action was completed by approximately 2,000 feet  
(610 m) above the lake.  The operator's normal procedure before a water landing was for 
the tandem master to disconnect both lower passenger harness connections.  This would 
prepare them  for separation immediately after landing. The tandem master was only able 
to disconnect the lower -right passenger harness connection before impact because their 
left arm was operating the left brake line.   
Unintended  water landing  
3.22. The tandem pair struck t he water while spinning in an almost horizontal , right -side-down  
attitude . A conservative estimate  of the  combined vertical and rotational velocity just 
before impact was in the range of 50 to 7 0 kilometres per hour. The tandem master 
reduced th is slightly  by judicious use of the left brake line.  They were submerged during 
the initial impact and the canopy and suspension lines came to rest on top of them. The 
following description is based on the tandem master's account and supported by video 
and still imag es recovered from the  tandem master's  wrist -mounted camera system.  
3.23. The tandem master recalled releasing the rider's harness and pushing the rider towards 
the surface. The reserve parachute lines had become entwined around both the tandem 
master's and the rider's  legs.  
3.24. While treading water, with the harness and  reserve  parachute still attached, the tandem 
master dived to clear the parachute lines from around the rider's legs. The tandem 
master retrieved the hook knife from the rider's harness then star ted to cut the lines 
from around the rider's feet. The tandem master also recalled trying to remove the main 
harness and reserve parachute.  
3.25. The tandem rider could not inflate the lifejacket  by pulling the red handle , so the tandem 
master tried but was als o unable to inflate it. The tandem master then used the manual 
inflation pipe  but could only partially inflate  the lifejacket . 
3.26. The tandem master recalled diving again to remove the main harness completely and cut 
the remaining tangled lines from around their own  legs.  
3.27. The tandem master lost sight of the rider after about four minutes in the water , then was 
rescued by a small boat  after a total of about 13 minutes  of treading water.  
Why it happened  
Main canopy malfunction  
3.28. A main canopy malfunction can principally be the result of equipment failure , a 
parachutist's actions leading to an unstable opening,  or packing problems. In the 
absence of any equipment failure being identified, the investigation considered the 
remaining two possibilities.  
 
26 The point when the angle between the relative airflow into the parachute canopy and the chord of the 
ram-air aerofoil wing section is too great for the wing to maintain full inflation pressure. The top and 
bottom sur faces of the canopy may flutter and the sink rate will increase . 
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 27 >>
 Unstable opening  
3.29. The operator had recently change d parachuting equipment27. Two key differences 
between the old and new equipm ent were with the drogue behaviour on the 
deployment of the main parachute and the lack of a pre-set brake setting in the new 
main parachute. As a result of these differences , the new equipment required tandem 
masters  to use a new opening technique. If the  old technique were  used  with the new 
equipment , there was a risk of an unstable opening , which could lead to a main canopy 
malfunction . Since changing to the new equipment the operator had noticed an increase 
in the rate of main canopy malfunctions.  
3.30. With the previous container system, the drop speed remained the same as the drogue 
was released to deploy the main parachute. However, the new container system 
collapsed the drogue chute, which briefly accelerated the tandem pair's  descent rate 
when the drogue was released.   
3.31. The previous and new main canopies performed similarly  when fully inflated , but the 
previous canopy would open to fly at a lower speed with half -brake set , while the new 
main canopy would open and fly at maximum speed without brake .  
3.32. The combined effect of these two differences could accentuate any instability or 
asymmetric forces applied to the tandem pair and canopy during the opening sequence 
and lead to opening problems. The operator was aware of these differences and had 
trained a ll tandem masters on the correct technique s for the new equipment before they 
were allowed to take commercial passengers.  
3.33. An analysis of t he video recording with the independent industry advisor28 showed the 
tandem pair was in a stabilised attitude at open ing and facing the PLA. Although t he 
video did not show all the tandem pair 's body movements, the background view and t he 
risers being drawn out cleanly without a twist were  good indicator s of their stability.   
3.34. The video also showed that the right riser loaded up first and the tandem pair was swung 
onto their back s and around to their left towards the direction in which the main canopy 
was flying. This showed that the tandem pair's  attitude  was unlike ly to have contributed 
to the main cano py turning as it inflated.  
Main parachute packing  problems  
3.35. There are  three possible packing issues  that could induce a line twist : an uneven 
deployment bag, a line dump and an uneven canopy inflation. Of these three 
possibilities, the advisor was unable t o determine which may have been  most likely  in 
this accident .  
3.36. Packers were trained, checked and generally supervised while they repack ed main 
parachutes. The workload was shared between the packers on duty for the day.  
3.37. The main canopies were repacked in an open area with several parachutes being packed 
simultaneously , and the packers were under time pressure to meet operational demands 
for the day. On the day of the accid ent six packers were on duty and they each repacked 
one or two main parachutes after each plane load. They had repacked at least 13 main 
 
27 From the 'Strong' Dual Hawk tandem container system with the Hop 330 main canopy to the UPT 
Micro Sigma container system with Icarus 300 and 330 mains.  
28 A tandem master and parachute techn ician experienced on the Micro Sigma system and the Icarus 
main canopies. (Further details in 9.7 .) 
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 28 >>
 parachutes each by 1300 that day , which is considered to be a high but not an excessive 
workload.  
3.38. The operator 's packi ng records and incident reports were checked for any standout 
repeat incidents. The packing history of the packer who packed the accident parachute 
was also checked. No evidence was found in the operator's records that could have 
suggest ed any link between  the packers working that day and the main parachute 
opening with a line twist .  
3.39. The packer should have been tested for drug and alcohol immediately after the incident , 
in accordance with the operator's procedures , but was not. The operator reported this 
was because the operator's staff  were engaged in the search and rescue operation. The 
packer had passed a test four weeks earlier.   
3.40. After this accident the operator engaged an independent parachute technician to check 
the reserve parachutes and the operator's general packing process  (see 3.61 for further 
detail) . That parachute technician identified several potential improvements for the main 
parachute repacking process that the operator ha s since implemented . One of these 
related to line twists.  
3.41. Given the above evidence and the process of elimination, the advisor believed  that the 
packing likely29 contributed to the asymmetrical main canopy inflation , leading to a line 
twist .  
Reserve canopy malfunction  
Tension -knot formation  
3.42. The permanent compression marks found in the two suspension lines in the reserve 
parachute were  likely caused by a tension knot. The accident flight was the first in which  
the rese rve parachute had been deployed. The two compressed sections of suspension 
line D4 to Cell 6 shown in  Figure 6 were about 1,300  millimetres  apart , which coincided 
with the length of one 'S' fold in the free bag's line pouch.  The other line that showed a 
similar compression was line C5 connected to Cell 8. Both lines passed through the same 
grommet in the rear right of the slider and were therefore likely to have been involved in 
the same tension knot.  
 
29 See section 11 for expressions of 'probability'.  

 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 30 >>
 operator's  concerns were based on three design aspects of the VTC -1 reserve parachute 
(see Figure 11 ): 
• it used continuous lines , which increased the bulk of line material to be packed  
• it used Dacron fibre for the lines. This resulted in a thicker line than other materials of 
the same loading , and the operator believed that Dacron lines tended to grip against 
other lines when packed toge ther 
• the lines were packed into a free bag pouch that was then sealed closed with a hook -
and-loop32 sealing strip across the open end of the line pouch. The operator believed 
that when the lines were  extracted during deployment, they were  pulled through the 
line pouch's sealing strip and could fray and catch other lines.  
3.47. The operator stated that it had experienced five malfunctions with the VTC -1 reserve 
parachute over several years at its Australian operations and that these had resulted  in 
serious injuries. The Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority had approved the 
operator's request to use an alternative manufacturer's reserve parachute in the Micro 
Sigma container for its operations in Australia. The operator stated that since the  change, 
it had had 15 years of trouble -free use from its preferred alternative reserve parachute 
and wanted to use the same combination in New Zealand.  
3.48. In mid -2016 t he operator asked the CAA flight operations inspector , who was in regular 
contact, about m aking a similar change to its  New Zealand  tandem parachute 
assemblies. Email exchanges and meetings on the subject continued between the CAA 
and the operator for a few months , but a pathway for that change was not clear to the 
operator. At the time of the accident these discussions had not progressed to a formal 
application by the operator to change the reserve parachute in its Micro Sigma tandem 
parachute assemblies or its Part 115 exposition.  
3.49. Civil Aviation Rule  105.51(b)(1) requires tandem reserve parac hute assemblies to comply 
with the technical standards of a parachute organisation. In this case, NZPIA's  technical 
standard deferred such decisions o n equipment compatibility between individually 
approved components (as is the case when approved to FAA TSO C23b) to a 'parachute 
technician' under NZPIA rule 19.2.2(4). Therefore, an operator could evaluate the 
compatibility of components in a parachute  assembly using its own parachute 
technicians. Any change in component s for the parachute assembly would the n require 
formal approval from the CAA to revise the Part 115 operator's exposition.  
3.50. The Commission sought accident data to provide a context for the operator's claims of 
unreliability. Data was requested from the CAA to compare reserve parachute reliabili ty 
levels  in New Zealand. The CAA data records lacked the detail needed to extract 
performance information on this type of equipment.  
3.51. The Commission also sought the manufacturer's opinion. UPT explained that the reserve 
parachute system had undergone substantial testing to achieve its TSO compliance 
status and that it had been  designed to open safely carrying a tandem pair at maximum 
permissible weight falling at terminal velocity free -fall (no drogue chute).  The primary 
reason for UPT selecting continuous Dacron lines was their performance under such 
extreme opening conditions and the distribution of shock loads across the canopy.  
3.52. UPT s tated that the VTC -1 reserve parachute ha d been in service for more than  30 years 
with proven reliability.  It compared the operator's claim of five malfunctions with the 
 
32 Often refer red to by trade names such as 'Velcro' . 

 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 32 >>
 most common line type used on tandem main and sport main parachutes was Vectran33, 
which it also believed was the line type most associated with tension knot s. 
3.55. The Commission was unable to determine with any certainty if the VTC -1 reserve 
parachute was more susceptible to tension knot s than any alternative tandem reserve 
parachute .  
3.56. UPT advised the Commission  in January 2021  that it had been working on the des ign 
and testing of a new tandem reserve parachute since about 2012. It was released for sale 
in late 2020 as the Sigma -II Reserve 340. This new reserve parachute was designed to 
have less packed bulk and to fit into the smaller Micro Sigma container and fr ee bag34. 
The lines are cascaded Vectran rather than Dacron and the reserve parachute meets the 
current TSO -C23f standard. UPT discontinued production of the VTC -1 (also known as 
the VR -360) from 8 December 2020.  
Parachutists ' attitude at opening  
3.57. Reserve parachutes are designed to open reliably in unusual circumstances, but these 
circumstances were not unusual. The video record showed the tandem pair was 
suspended vertically and spinning when the tandem master cut away the main canopy.  
They were descending at sub -terminal speed  and the  extraction of the reserve canopy 
free bag from the parachute container was fast. It was  assisted through the Skyhook 
connection  to the rejected main canopy . The tandem master said that the reserve 
deployme nt was clean and symmetrical.   
3.58. The spinning attitude was more or less likely to have affected the lines as they unfurled , 
but there was no evidence to show that it led to the formation of a tension knot . The 
Commission was unable to determine with any certainty if the tandem pair's attitude 
influenced the formation of the tension knots in the reserve parachute 's lines.  
Packing technique for reserve  parachute s 
3.59. The reserve parachute was one of a batch of 62 new parachute containers purchased by 
the operator. Two of its  parachute technicians had assembled and packed all of them.  
These parachute technicians had trained in the USA as master riggers35 but held different 
ratings in New Zealand and were both experience d with packing reserve parachutes, 
including the VTC -1 reserve.  
3.60. The Commission, the CAA and the operator random ly selected four, packed tandem 
parachute assemblies from the parachute racks to unpack and  inspect.  No packing errors 
or concerns with the packing technique s were found in this sample of parachute 
assemblies .  
3.61. The operator subsequently brought in another independent parachute technician from a 
competitor's operation to review its packing operations and another sample of reserve 
parachutes. This technician noted that one reserve parachute was found with a 180 -
degree twist in the rear lines. Th at parachute technician considered that this twist was 
unlikely to cause  a major problem but that it was not acceptable .  
 
33 A multifilament yarn spun from liquid crystal polymer and manufactured by Kuraray.  
34 The standard Sigma container is wider and deeper than the Micro Sigma container. The same VTC -1 
reserve parachute is used in both  containers, but it has to be packed slightly differently to fit into the smaller 
free bag in the Micro Sigma container.  
35 Equivalent to master parachute technician in New Zealand.  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 33 >>
 3.62. As a result of this review, the operator made several improvements to its packing 
operations.  
3.63. The Commi ssion contacted the manufacturer of the reserve parachute (UPT) to seek its 
opinion on the reserve malfunction. UPT could find no reason for the reserve parachute 
not opening fully. UPT agreed that the canopy distortion was in the right rear corner , but 
could not positively identify why this had occurred.  
3.64. UPT suggested that, although it believed that the reserve parachute had been packed 
correctly, small changes in packing technique could improve reliability. It stated,  "Tension 
knots, like all parachute  malfunctions, are not 100% preventable.  A correctly built, 
correctly packed, correctly deployed parachute, main or reserve, can still malfunction.  
That is the nature of parachutes in general ." UPT offered several possible reasons for a 
packing technique to lead to a tension knot:  
• an uneven or asymmetrical stowage of the reserve parachute lines within the free 
bag's line pouch  
• free bag line pouch hook -and-loop mating inconsistencies across the bag  
• the p lacement of the reserve risers and the 'fanning ' of the reserve risers in the 
reserve pack36  tray during the packing process  
• the p lacement of the 'free' reserve lines (outside the pouch) in the reserve pack tray 
from the reserve risers to the reserve free bag  
• the orientation of the reserve bag extraction based on tandem -pair body position 
during the reserve deployment.  (The multi -axis separation forces between the free 
bag and the tandem pair will vary with the spin state of the main canopy being cut 
away. ) 
3.65. After  a reserve parachute has been  deployed , it is not possible to ascertain  how it was 
packed , apart from through its behaviour on opening. The Commission was unable to 
determine with any certainty if the way the reserve parachute was packed influenced the 
forma tion of the tension knots in the reserve parachute's lines . 
Lifejacket  malfunction  
Safety issue: The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme  in place for its 
lifejacket s to ensure they remain ed in a serviceable condition . 
  
Safety issue: The operator expected the tandem master to have the reserve parachute pack for 
flotation and therefore did not require them to also wear  a lifejacket .  
3.66. The operator had recognised that the Queenstown site posed a risk of unintentional 
parachu te landings in the adjacent lake , and after taking ownership had taken steps to 
mitigate that risk. It had purchased modified  lifejacket s certified  for use by parachutists 
in Australia and provided the m to all tandem riders  (see 2.32 to 2.33 for details on the 
modification ). It had  also conducted water survival training for tandem masters  in late 
2017 using the new Micro Sigma container . It also had a rescue plan in place  for an 
unintended water landing . 
3.67. Although t he modifie d lifejacket  was a certified  aviation product for parachutists in 
Australia , it was  not certified in New Zealand . Additionally, the modification was not 
authorised by the original manufacturer and the lifejacket no longer conformed with the 
 
36 A reserve parachute packed into its compartment in the parachute container.  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 34 >>
 original manufa cturer's TSO  for its intended use in passenger aircraft . The design 
compliance stamp stated that  it still conform ed with TSO C13f and remained on the front 
of the lifejacket . This was misleading , but otherwise the lifejacket was deemed fit by the 
APF for its new  purpose  in the parachuting sector . 
3.68. The APF equipment standard required that the lifejacket  be uniquely identified and 
undergo a regular maintenance  and inspection programme  to ensure it re mained 
serviceable. The New Zealand Civil Aviation Rules  and NZPIA's  rules did not recognise or 
endorse the APF standard , nor did they have equivalent requirement s for these 
lifejackets  in New Zealand . Consequently, t he CAA rules did not require  the operat or to 
have a maintenance  and inspection  programme  for its lifejackets  at the time  of this 
accident .  
3.69. While the lifejackets were new,  they were in unsealed, zippered pouch es. The greater risk 
was for the end user s. There was no external marking to indicate that the lifejacket s were 
still in a serviceable state before  being  worn  (much like the details  a tandem master 
would check  when conducting a parachute pre-flight  check37). The operator  has since 
implemented a main tenance and inspection  programme  to ensure  that only serviceable 
lifejackets are made available for parachut e descents . 
3.70. The tandem master had the option  of wear ing a lifejacket but neither the CAA rules nor 
the operator require d them to do so. The operator had tested and proven  that the 
reserve pack  would assist  a tandem master to remain afloat , while a tandem rider had 
their own lifejacket . If the tandem master chose to wear  a lifejacket model used by 
tandem riders , in its p ackaged state it would fit  between them . This situation could make 
it more difficult  for a tandem master to extract and fit their lifejacket  over their head 
before a water landing . In this accident, the tandem master deployed the reserve 
parachute and therefor e the reserve pack was not able to provide flotation support . 
3.71. The reason for the lifejacket  used on this  parachute descent  not fully inflating  could not 
be conclusively determine d and it has not been  recovered.  Possible reasons in sequential 
order of occurrence are: a manufacturing fault; an empty or loose gas bottle when either 
it was last packed and placed on a rack ready for use or , during the descent after being 
fitted on the tandem rider; damage upon impact with the water; and damage while in 
the water.   
 
37 See Civil Aviation Rules 105.109, which lists details for a pre -flight parachute check.  

 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 36 >>
 experience in water  landings . Neither parachute organisation requires  its qualified 
parachutist members to have assessed skills in actual or simulated water landings. The 
NZPO require s tandem riders to wear lifejacket s if exit or landing area s are near water , 
but the NZPIA just recommend s that  they wear lifejacket s in these situations .  
3.75. Civil Aviation Rule  Part 115 does  not specifically require  tandem parachute operator s to 
consider the key safety factors in maximis ing parachutists' chance s of survival after  
unintended  water landing s, such as the likely survival time s for parachutists in  water  and 
their rescue . However, Part 115 parachute operators do have a non -specific requirement 
under Civil Aviation Rules 115.209 and Part 10038 to identify and manage associated risk s 
to their operation.  Part 100 would require operators to have safety management system s 
and to identify and manage all relevant hazards . This operator still had six months to 
submit its draft safety management system to the  CAA for review . The CAA planned to 
apply the rule to the sector by February 2021.  
3.76. In comparison, the  United States Parachute Association  (USPA ) require s all advanced 
parachutists (holders of USPA B licences) to complete water -landing training as a 
prerequisite to the issue of  their licence s. The USPA also consider s the associated risks of 
unintended water landing s and emphasise s in its training that a parachutist's survival 
after an unintended water landing depend s on a means of flotation and effecting a 
successful rescue (Daniel, 2015) .  
3.77. The Civil Aviation Rule s reference several standards39 for 'life preservers ' that are 
approved for use in aircraft40. However, these standards correspond with 'life preservers ' 
designed for use in aircraft and marine situations , and are not directly applicable for use 
in a parachuting situation  where such devices could be hazardous to use .  
3.78. Lifejackets  used in aircraft  are usually stowed in the aircraft until required , but they are 
not suitable for attach ing to parachu te harness es for use by parachutists . Such device s 
worn with parachute harness es are  also subject to harsher operating conditions than 
stowed device s. Similarly, n ot all 'personal flotation devices ' made in compliance with 
New Zealand Standard 5823 :200541 would be suitable for use in parachuting operations.  
For example, Maritime New Zealan d Rules 91.4-Personal flotation devices  require 
personal flotation devices to be worn for commercial marine operations.  The associated 
Maritime New Zealand Advisory C ircular AC91 -2 lists multiple specialist personal 
flotation device types that substantially comply with the New Zealand S tandard 5823 for 
specific water activities.  
3.79. Civil Aviation Rule Part 105 requires  all parachutists to comply with the technical 
standa rds of a Part 149 parachute organisation. Part 105 specifically refers only to 
technical standards for parachute equipment and does not mention lifejacket s. 
Consequently,  neither of the New Zealand parachute organisations has technical 
standards for suitab le lifejacket s or associated  requirement s to ensure such lifejackets 
remain  in a serviceable state.  
3.80. The NZPIA has since reissued its rules and operating procedures to provide more clarity 
on equipment maintenance and water landings.  
 
38 Part 100 was in implementation phase and was not applicable to the operator at the time of this accident.

 Survivability  
Safety i ssue: The operator's planned water emergency response did not have due regard to the 
minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water . 
3.81. The operator had not experienced a water landing previously , but had an emergency 
response plan should this occur. It included raising the alarm through an air traffic  
controller and the Police emergency number. It relied on the harbourmaster and 
Queenstown Coastguard providing a waterborne rescue effort.  
3.82. The operator's pl an did not ensure  parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for 
survival in the conditions, nor did it have a vessel to implement such a recovery. 
However, the plan was an improvement on the previous operator's plan for that location , 
and the operato r has since provided its own rescue vessel at the aerodrome .  
3.83. The water temperature was about 10° Celsius , which limited the likely survival time of the 
tandem pair . A research report prepared for Transport Canada in 2001 identified four 
stages after immer sion in cold water where death can occur (Brooks, 2001) . They are , in 
order of severity:  
1 - cold shock  
2 - swimming failure  
3 - hypothermia  
4 - post-rescue collapse.  
3.84. The research report stated that the anticipated survival times had usually been based on 
a person reaching the hypothermic stage, but it is now considered that stages 1 and 2 
are more common causes of death.  Drowning can occur from cold shock affecting the  
circulatory and respiratory systems within five minutes, followed by loss of dexterity 
within 30 minutes, leading to an inability to remain afloat. The operator 's water 
emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of  
their entering the water  at La ke Wakatipu .  
Accident and incident data  
Safety issue: The CAA dataset for parachut ing occurrences did not include key fields, which likely 
reduced its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector . 
3.85. The CAA policy on the collection of safety information defines its expectations as 
paraphrased below.  
The CAA has a set of tools  it can deploy to change the attitudes and behaviours 
of participants in the civil aviation system. To make these tools effective, the CAA 
collects safety data and information, assesses it and disseminates it … The CAA 
will make a reasonable attempt to veri fy the safety data and information supplied 
to it but expects those providing mandatory reports [under Civil Aviation Rules 
Part 12  - Accidents, Incidents, and Statistic s] to ensure the data and information 
contained within the reports is accurate  (CAA, 2009) .  
3.86. For a  safety management system to be effective, it needs to be based on a 
comprehensive record of occurrence data . Analyses of that data may identify trends and 
enable a safety manager to implement solutions before these t rends result in accident s. 
Individual Part 115 parachute operators are required to manage their own occurrence 
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 38 >>
 database s and to report occurrences to  the CAA. The data from these reports is then 
entered into the CAA occurrence database  to provide a national resource.  
3.87. However, when the Commission examined the CAA occurrence data, it found it to be 
rudimentary and not thorough enough  to identify  some  trends . For example, the CAA 
database did not record relevant details about a parachute a ssembly even if they were  
provided in the parachute operator's Civil Aviation Rules Part 12 (Accidents, Incidents, 
and Statistic s) report. Relevant e xamples for this accident were : the type of reserve 
parachute; if the reserve parachute was activated; how the reserve parachute was 
activated ; and if the reserve parachute opened without problems.   
3.88. The CAA introduced a dedicated skydiving incident -reporting form  after this accident , 
but it is not included in Civil Aviation Rules Part 12 and its use is not described in the 
associated Advisory Circular  AC12 -1. The new form also lacks any fields for the 
equipment details of a reserve parachute and AAD or if one had been activated.  The CAA 
subsequently advised , on 16 October 2020, that AC12 -1 was being u pdated to include 
adventure aviation reporting . 
3.89. This mismatch between submitted occurrence data from operators and a reduced subset 
of data recorded by the CAA was a lost opportunity for the CAA to gain national insight s 
into the safety performance of the parachute sector.

 4 Findings  
4.1. The main parachute canopy inflated asymmetrically , resulting in the canopy turning to 
the tandem pair's left as it opened and the suspension lines  twisting .  
4.2. The main parachute 's packing likely42 contributed to its opening asymmetrically.  
4.3. The reserve parachute developed a tension knot as it opened that the tandem master 
was unable to clear. The tension knot deformed the right rear part of the canopy , and 
this resulted in the tandem pair descending in a steep, right -hand spiral turn until they 
struck  the water  at Lake Wakatipu .  
4.4. The cause of the tension knot forming in the suspension lines of the reserve parachute 
could not be conclusively determined.  
4.5. There was insufficient evidence to det ermine if the VTC -1 reserve parachute was more 
susceptible to tension knots than any alternative tandem reserve parachute . 
4.6. The tandem rider's lifejacket  could not be inflated sufficiently to support the rider's head 
above water.  
4.7. The reason for the lifejacket  not inflating fully could not be conclusively determined.  
4.8. The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme  in place for its 
lifejacket s to ensure they remain ed in a serviceable  condition .  
4.9. At the time of this accident, n either th e Civil Aviation Rules nor the operator required 
tandem masters to wear lifejacket s.  
4.10. The Civil Aviation Rules did not set minimum safety requirements for tandem 
parachuting operations to mitigate the risk of a parachute landing  unintentionally  in 
water . 
4.11. The Civil Aviation Rules  referenced standards for life preservers and flotation devices  that 
were generic and not specifically  suitable for  parachute  operations.  
4.12. The operator's planned water emergency response did not have due regard to the 
minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water.  
4.13. The Civil Aviation Authority  dataset  for parachut ing occurrences  did not include key 
fields, which likely reduced its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the 
sector.

 5 Safety issues  and remedial action  
General   
5.1. Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.  
5.2. Safety issues may be addressed by safety action s taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue . 
Lifejacket  maintenance programme  
5.3. Maintenance programme s ensure that equipment is airworthy and able to perform its 
function s when required. The operator's l ack of a  programme for  the maintenance  and 
inspection of lifejacket s introduced a risk to the operation in that the condition of 
lifejacket s and their ability to perform their intended function s were  unknown.  
5.4. The operator has taken safety action on this issue and implemented a maintenance  and 
inspection programme  for lifejacket s. 
Flotation equipment provided to tandem masters  
5.5. Recovery controls are important in ensuring that when a hazardous event occurs, the 
consequences can be minimised. In the oper ator not requiring  tandem masters to wear  
lifejacket s, there was an increased risk of the tandem masters  not be ing able to remain 
afloat after an unintended water landing .  
5.6. The operator has taken safety action on this issue and now requires  all tandem mast ers 
to wear  lifejacket s.  
Rules and procedures for operating near a body of water  
5.7. Rules, operating procedures and standards are put in  place to ensure a basic set of 
requirements is met, but if they  are not well defined, their intent may be misinterpreted . 
The Civil Aviation R ules for parachuting  near a significant body of water are not we ll 
defined in Part 105. Rule Part 105 forms the basis of safety across the parachute sector 
and is referenced in P arts 149 and 115. There is a consequent risk that the procedures 
implemented by Part 115 parachute operators to operate near a significant body of 
water will not meet minimum level s of safety.  
5.8. No safety action has been taken with Civil Aviation Rule Part 1 05 to better define the 
minimum safety requirements for parachuting near water .  
5.9. The NZPIA took safety action after this accident to improve  its Documents, Standards 
and Procedures Manual  and has publish ed a new  Water Landing Guideline  to reduce the 
risk for parachutists operating  under NZPIA rules .   
Standards for lifejacket s in parachute operations  
5.10. The CAA-referenced standards for lifejacket s were generic and not specific to skydiving 
operations. This present ed a risk that products certified to these standards will not  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 41 >>
 function as intended under parachuting operating conditions or be maintained in a 
serviceable condition.  
5.11. No safety action has been taken on this issue.  
Emergen cy response plan  
5.12. Emergency response plans ensure that timely assistance can be provided in an 
emergency. These plans need to consider the likely environment s in which emergenc ies 
could occur. In not considering the minimum survival time for people immersed in cold 
water, there was a risk that any water emergency response  by the operator  would not be 
able to provide assistance in a timely manner . 
5.13. The operator has taken safety action on th is issue and a rescue boat has been  positioned 
at the operator's base to enable more effective water recover ies. Personnel have been  
trained in the use of this equipment.  
Collection of occurrence data  
5.14. Effective safety management across the entire parachute  sector relies on the assessment 
of occurrence data. Without key fields being recorded  for parachute occurrences , the 
effectiveness of this tool for safety management in the sector  is reduced . 
5.15. The CAA has taken some safety action on this issue and updated and reissued its 
parachute online accident/incident reporting form CA005SKYDIVE (updated June 2018).  
The current form still lacks essential information , for example the equipment details of 
the reserve parachute and AAD and if the main parachute wa s cut away and the reserve 
parachute deployed. The associated Advisory Circular AC12 -1 does not contain any 
guidance for parachute -occurrence reporting.   
5.16. The CAA advised the Commission on 11 December 2020 and 12 March 2021 that it  had 
accepted safety recom mendation 012/20 (See paragraph 6.6) and collaborated with the 
NZPIA to improve the quality of data collec ted from  the parachute sector . It has  
expand ed the options for data descriptors that can be entered into the  CAA's  database 
system  and will seek more specific detail on the CA 005SKYDIVE form . It has  also 
commenced a review of Advisory Circular AC12 -1.

 6 Recommendations  
General  
6.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or 
organisation that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety 
issues, depending on whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only 
or to the wider transport sector. In this case, recommendation s have been issued to the 
Secretary of Transport , with notice of the recommendation s given to the Director of Civil 
Aviation . 
6.2. In the interests of transport safety, it is important that these  recommendation s are 
implemented without delay to help prevent similar ac cidents or incidents occurring in 
the future.  
New recommendations  
6.3. The Commission recommends that the Secretary for Transport  review and revise 
Civil Aviation Rule Parts 105, 115 and 149 for parachuting operations , in 
conjunction with the Part 149 organisa tions ' operating procedures and standards, 
to reduce the potential ly adverse  consequence s of an unintended water landing. 
(010/20) 
6.4. The Commission recommends that the Secretary for Transport  review and revise 
Civil Aviation Rule Parts 105, 115 and 149 for parachuting operations , in 
conjunction with the Part 149 organisations ' operating procedures and standards, 
to define flotation devices that are suitable for use by parachutists . (011/20) 
6.5. On the 1 March 2021 , the Ministry responded:  
The Ministry will now liaise with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), as the regulator of civil 
aviation in New Zealand, to investigate what action to take in response to the 
recommendations.  
The CAA oversees aviation safety and the ru les underpinning it. The CAA has a formal issues 
assessment process, and the final TAIC recommendations will be put through this process. 
As part of the process, the CAA will identify and assess options to resolve the issues raised.  
Following this, a poli cy investigation process will be undertaken. This is a more rigorous 
assessment of the problem, and the options and impacts of potential interventions. It is 
possible for a policy investigation to conclude that an action other than a rule amendment 
would b e more effective in addressing the issue.  
The Ministry will inform TAIC of the outcome of the above CAA process. I should reiterate, 
however, that this may not necessarily result in any rule changes.  
6.6. The Commission recommends  that the Director of Civil Av iation review the 
parachute accident and incident reporting system under Civil Aviation Rule  Part 12  
and Advisory Circular AC12 -1, in conjunction with the Part 115   and Part 149 
organisations ' requirements , to provide a more effective national resource to 
manage the sector's safety . (012/20) 
6.7. On 12 March 2021 , the Director of the Civil Aviation Authority responded:  
I can confirm that the Authority accepts recommendation 012/20. We are 
implementing the recommendation by:  
 
Final Report AO -2018 -001 
<< Page 43 >>
 • expanding the data descriptors of a parachute malfunction and 
recording specific information such as a line twist or tension knot.  
• asking partic ipants to provide more specific detail in the 
CAOOSSKYDIVE form.  
• updating Advisory Circular AC 12.1 to ensure there is an appropriate 
level of guidance for parachute occurrence reporting.  
• reviewing the parachute accident and incident reporting system  
under Civil Aviation Rule Part 12, with a particular focus on Part 149 
organisations' reporting requirements to provide a more effective 
national resource to manage the sector's safety.  
As referenced in the Civil Aviation Authority's letter to Lois Hutch inson, 
Chief Executive on 11 December 2020, we have already made significant 
progress on this work by adding additional data descriptors to our safety 
systems and updating the CAOOSSKYDIVE form in 2019. We also worked 
collaboratively with the New Zealand P arachute Industry Association to 
improve their data collection.    
Further, we have now commenced the review of Advisory Circular AC 
12.1. We will notify your office when the updated draft is made available 
for public consultation.  
Notice of safety recommendation s 
6.8. The Commission gives notice to the Director of Civil Aviation that it has issued 
safety recommendations 010/20 and 011/20 to the Secretary for Transport and 
that these recommendations will require the involvement of the Civil Aviation 
Autho rity to complete.

 7 Key lesson s 
7.1. If a parachute operation is based near a significant body of water, the operator needs to 
consider and mitigate the additional risk s presented by a parachut ist unintentionally 
landing in the water.  
7.2. All parachutists would benefit from gain ing practical or simulated experience s of a water 
landing before being issued  with their initial parachutists ' certificate s. 
7.3. All parachute -sector participants may benefit from  continued engagement with each 
other to improve industry guidance and the safety of parachuting in New Zealand.

 9 Transport Accident Investigation Commission - 
conduct of the inquiry  
9.1. On 10 January 2018 the CAA notified the Commission of the tandem skydiving accident. 
The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in charge.  
9.2. On 11 January 2018 two Commission investigators travelled to Queenstown. They 
received an initial briefing from local Police then met the operator's management team.  
9.3. On 12 January 2018 a technical advisor engaged by the Commission assisted with an 
initial examination of the parachute assembly and interviews with the tandem master and 
other key witnesses.  
9.4. During  the next three days the Commission investigators observed a simulation o f the 
operator's standard customer induction process, gathered evidence and documentation, 
and conducted further interviews.  
9.5. On 15 January  2018  the parachute assembly was transported to the Commission's 
technical facility in Wellington.  
9.6. The Commission inv estigators also contacted parachute organisations within New 
Zealand and Australia to clarify their roles and responsibilities in the parachute sector , 
and met with the CAA.  
9.7. On 13 July 2018 an independent industry advisor was engaged to provide subject -matter 
expertise.  This advisor had completed approximately 13,000 skydives , was a tandem 
master  and tandem instructor , and was rated as a parachute technician with experience 
on Sigma, Vector , Icarus  and Strong equipment.  
9.8. On 8 October 2018 the event memory in  the AAD that had been fitted to the parachute 
was downloaded for further analysis.  
9.9. On 11 October 2018 a selection of photos and video from the tandem master's wrist -
mounted GoPro was sent to the manufacturer of the reserve parachute for analysis and 
comme nt. 
9.10. On 24 February 2020  the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to 
interested persons for comment.  
9.11. Five submissions were received and considered.  
9.12. On 18 November 2020 the Commission approved a revised final draft report for a 
second review and comment by interested persons . Six submissions were received. This 
final report includes changes resulting from those submissions.

 The main parachute is packed into a deployment bag. In the case of the reserve parachute, a 
free bag  is used , which detaches from the canopy after deployment . The two parachutes in 
their deployment bags are packed into their own compartments in the backpack harness 
container s ystem.  
Suspension lines connect  the parachute canopy to risers , which are lengths of webbing that 
connect the lines to the harness.  They are arranged in rows from the nose to the tail and 
named A to D from front to back. The A lines are made shorter to hol d the nose down when 
the canopy inflates. There were four risers, each one connected to its own line group.  
Once correctly inflated, the parachute is controlled by brake lines attached to either side of the 
canopy  along the trailing edge  (canopy tail) . The  brake lines are routed down to hand toggles . 
Pulling down on one toggle will increase the  drag on that respective side of the parachute , 
resulting in a turn in that direction. Pulling both toggles together will slow the entire parachute 
down ; it acts like a brake during landing.   
Ram-air parachutes may be rectangular or tapered. High -performance ram -air parachutes are 
the tapered style wit h an elliptical shape.

 TAIC Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngati Raukawa, 
Tuwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies an d how to prevent them. A 'waka whai mārama (i te 
ara haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding'. Waka is metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papa tūānuku 
(Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 'haumaru' is 'safe or risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - The safe an d risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of 
knowledge that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. 
The continual wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represent the individual 
inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwha i. 
Aviation: ng ā hau e wh ā - the four winds  
 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa's 'long 
white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for aviation.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this 
Kōwhaiwhai.  
Marine: ara wai - waterways  
 
The sections of waves flowing across  the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The 'V' shape is a ship's prow and its wake. The letter 'M' is present, standing for 'Marine'.  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwh aiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. 'Rere' is to flow or fly. 'Whenua' is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. T he letter 'R' is 
present, standing for 'Rail'.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells within) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
