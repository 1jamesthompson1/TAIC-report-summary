- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication in the document that fatigue management played a role in the incident. The train controller "had been awake for at least four hours when the incident occurred and was about 90 minutes into his shift" and his "food and liquid intake was normal" (4.2.1).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: Human error and assumptions were significant factors in the incident. The train controller made a mistake in setting the route manually (4.2.1), and the driver assumed that the route ahead had been correctly set for his train, selectively reading the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803 but not recognizing that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train (4.3.3, 4.3.7).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While the train controller and driver were both qualified, the incident occurred during a period when train controllers were becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line and were setting routes manually (4.2.1, 5.1). This suggests that additional training or competency development could have been beneficial.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The train controller was familiar with multitasking between zones and across several computer screens (4.2.1). However, the manual setting of routes due to construction works at Wiri Junction (4.2.2) indicates that there may have been a lack of familiarity with the new process, contributing to the incident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Crew Resource Management issues were evident in the miscommunication between the train controller and the driver, resulting in a different understanding of how the train would be recovered to its correct route (4.4.5, 4.4.6, 5.5, 5.6).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The incident involved a violation of rail operating rules when the train was driven back towards Puhinui Station without the required protection from other train movements (4.4.5). This indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not provide explicit evidence of organizational safety culture contributing to the incident, but the repeated occurrence of wrong-route incidents (4.2.4) and the casual nature of the communication during the recovery (4.4.6) suggest that there may be underlying cultural issues.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The statistics provided by KiwiRail and the fact that manual route setting was still in place despite known risks (4.2.5, 4.2.7) indicate that risk management and analysis processes may not have been fully effective in preventing the incident.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention in the document of regulatory oversight and compliance issues contributing to the incident.

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The driver's lack of situational awareness contributed to the incident, as he did not recognize that the signal was indicating a wrong route for his train (4.3.3, 4.3.7).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide information suggesting that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the incident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There were no issues associated with the track, signalling system, or train that contributed to the incident (4.1.4).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The lack of automatic route setting due to ongoing construction works at Wiri Junction contributed to the incident, as routes had to be set manually (4.2.2, 4.2.8).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not mention weather conditions affecting the incident.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Communication breakdown was a significant factor in the incident, as evidenced by the miscommunication between the train controller and the driver during the recovery sequence (4.4.5, 4.4.6, 5.5, 5.6).
