The train controller ""had been awake for at least four hours when the incident occurred and was about 90 minutes into his shift"" and his ""food and liquid intake was normal"" (4.2.1).
","0.0","33.333","Human error and assumptions were significant factors in the incident. The train controller made a mistake in setting the route manually (4.2.1), and the driver assumed that the route ahead had been correctly set for his train, selectively reading the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803 but not recognizing that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train (4.3.3, 4.3.7).
","5.774","10.0","While the train controller and driver were both qualified, the incident occurred during a period when train controllers were becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line and were setting routes manually (4.2.1, 5.1). This suggests that additional training or competency development could have been beneficial.
","0.0","5.0","The train controller was familiar with multitasking between zones and across several computer screens (4.2.1). However, the manual setting of routes due to construction works at Wiri Junction (4.2.2) indicates that there may have been a lack of familiarity with the new process, contributing to the incident.
","0.0","20.0","Crew Resource Management issues were evident in the miscommunication between the train controller and the driver, resulting in a different understanding of how the train would be recovered to its correct route (4.4.5, 4.4.6, 5.5, 5.6).
","0.0","13.333","The incident involved a violation of rail operating rules when the train was driven back towards Puhinui Station without the required protection from other train movements (4.4.5). This indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures.
","2.887","5.0","The document does not provide explicit evidence of organizational safety culture contributing to the incident, but the repeated occurrence of wrong-route incidents (4.2.4) and the casual nature of the communication during the recovery (4.4.6) suggest that there may be underlying cultural issues.
","0.0","5.0","The statistics provided by KiwiRail and the fact that manual route setting was still in place despite known risks (4.2.5, 4.2.7) indicate that risk management and analysis processes may not have been fully effective in preventing the incident.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention in the document of regulatory oversight and compliance issues contributing to the incident.
","0.0","5.0","The driver's lack of situational awareness contributed to the incident, as he did not recognize that the signal was indicating a wrong route for his train (4.3.3, 4.3.7).

","0.0","0.0","There were no issues associated with the track, signalling system, or train that contributed to the incident (4.1.4).
","0.0","3.333","The lack of automatic route setting due to ongoing construction works at Wiri Junction contributed to the incident, as routes had to be set manually (4.2.2, 4.2.8).
