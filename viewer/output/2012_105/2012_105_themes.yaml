- name: Human Error in Manual Route Setting
  explanation: Human error in manual route setting is a significant safety theme as it directly contributed to the wrong-routing of the train. The report states that "the train controller was qualified to control any of the Auckland control zones and was familiar with multitasking between the zones and across several computer screens," yet he made a mistake in setting the route manually due to the increased risk of human error during the morning peak train control workload (4.2.1, 4.2.2). This theme is relevant because the train controllers were in a transition period, becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line and were required to set routes manually, which increased the risk of error (5.1, 5.2).
- name: Misinterpretation of Signals by Train Driver
  explanation: Misinterpretation of signals by the train driver is another safety theme. The driver, despite being qualified and familiar with the route, failed to recognize that the signal was indicating a wrong route for his train. The report notes that "the driver assumed that the route ahead had been correctly set for his train" and "selectively read the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803 but did not recognize that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risk associated with drivers making assumptions about their routes and the importance of correctly interpreting signals to prevent accidents.
- name: Inadequate Communication During Recovery
  explanation: Inadequate communication during the recovery process is a critical safety theme. The report identifies a safety issue where "the radio communication between the train controller and the train driver was open loop," leading to a situation where "neither party really understood the other's intentions" (4.4). This miscommunication resulted in the train being driven back towards Puhinui Station without the required protection from other train movements, creating a potential head-on collision with another passenger train (5.4, 5.5). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that clear and precise instructions were not issued at a critical moment, which could have averted the violation of rail operating rules (5.6).
- name: Lack of Automatic Route Setting
  explanation: The lack of automatic route setting is a safety theme that underpins the incident. At the time of the incident, "train controllers had to set routes manually because the construction works at Wiri Junction were still in progress" (4.2.2). The report indicates that KiwiRail planned to provide automatic route setting within the train control system, which would have reduced the likelihood of a wrong-route being set (4.2.8). This theme is relevant as the manual setting of routes was a temporary measure until the completion of track layout changes, and the subsequent commissioning of automatic route setting has since reduced the risk of such incidents.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Safety Procedures
  explanation: Training and familiarity with safety procedures is a safety theme that emerges from the driver's actions during the incident. The driver had been trained in the use of the SWA-01 procedure required for setting back a train, but had not used one in his two years of driving. The report suggests that "he should have been familiar enough with the rules to realise that what he was about to do required a SWA-01 procedure to be completed before setting his train back" (4.4.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of not only training but also the practical application and familiarity with safety procedures to ensure they are followed correctly in real-world situations.
- name: Crew Resource Management and Standardized Communication
  explanation: Crew resource management and standardized communication is a safety theme that is highlighted by the report's findings on the need for clear communication and the use of all available resources to ensure safe operations. The report discusses the concept of crew resource management, where "rail participants make use of all the resources available to ensure they all work with consistent information to ensure a successful execution of the plan/task" (4.4.6). The relevance of this theme is demonstrated by the incident, which serves as an example of the need for improvement in the way some rail participants are communicating, particularly during non-routine operations (4.4.8).
