  \ route for a train should not in itself create a serious safety issue , as long\
  \ as \nthe driver recognises and complies with the signals.  However,  it does \
  \ raise the level of risk.  \nOne potential consequence of a wrong -route11 setting\
  \ is  the driver not recognis ing that a \nsignal is indicating  their train is\
  \ about to follow a route different from the one  they are \nexpecting.   It can\
  \  result in the train t aking a n alternat ive route at too high a speed for the\
  \ track \ngeometry .  The Commission has reported on two such incidents.  One was\
  \ a train that nearly \nrolled over when it passed through a turnout at Tamaki above\
  \ the speed limit (TAIC, 2012)  and \nthe other was a  similar event at Westfield\
  \ , where the train did roll over (TAIC, 2015) .   \n4.1.2.  In this case the alternat\
  \ ive route was straight ahead  at normal speed  instead of through the \nspeed\
  \ -restricted turnout to the Manukau Branch Line, so the risk of derailing  was\
  \ low.  The \nmain effect was  a service delay and an inconvenience to the passengers\
  \ . \n4.1.3.  The safety issue arising from this incident was the misunderstanding\
  \  between the train \ncontroller  and the driver during the recovery sequence ,\
  \ which resulted in a potential head -on \ncollision with another train .  \n4.1.4.\
  \  There were no issues associated with the track, the signalling system, the train\
  \ , the \nenvironment, the rail oper ating rules and procedures or the positioning\
  \ of signal 1803 that \ncontributed to this incident.   While radio reception from\
  \ train control in this type of train in the \nWiri Junction area may not have been\
  \ as clear as in other areas , it did not contribute  to the \ntrain taking the\
  \ wrong route or to the misunderstanding during the recovery sequence.   \n4.1.5.\
  \  The following analysis discusses the sequence of events that contributed to the\
  \ train taking \nthe wrong route.  It also discusses the safety issue of poor commun\
  \ ication between the train \ncontroller and the train driver . \n4.2. The route\
  \ setting   \n4.2.1.  The train controller was qualified to control any of the Auckland\
  \ control zones and was familiar \nwith multitasking between the zones and across\
  \ several computer screens.  Each workstation \nhad about nine computer screens.\
  \  Train movements were  near ing the m orning  peak but his \nworkload  was no\
  \ different from that on other days at that time.  He was managing two of the \n\
  Auckland control zones at the time of this incident and was looking after about\
  \ nine trains.  He \nhad been awake for at least four hours when the  incident occurred\
  \ and was about 90 minutes \ninto his shift.  His shift patterns had the normal\
  \ advancing start times for a rotating shift and \nhis food and liquid intake was\
  \ normal.  His drug and alcohol test was clear and there was no \nevidence to suggest\
  \ a  contributing medical cause.  He quickly recognised that he had made a \nmistake\
  \ and tried to correct it.  He said that he had felt fine on the day and everything\
  \ was \nrunning smoothly.  \n4.2.2.  At the time of the incident t rain controllers\
  \ had to set routes manually because the \nconstruction works at Wiri Junction were\
  \ still in progress .  They selected a train on the control \nworkstation and its\
  \ planned short -range destination point, then activate d a route between \nthose\
  \ points.  Minimal interlocking occurred to prevent a wrong  route being set , so\
  \ it was \nincumbent upon the train controller to set the correct route  manually\
  \ .   \n4.2.3.  KiwiRail had  commissioned the new Manukau Branch Line into service\
  \ four months before \nthis incident , on 15 April 2012.  The train numbers for\
  \ Manukau trains were prefixed with '41' \nor '42' to identify them clearly and\
  \ to facilitate future automatic route setting.  Previously, \npassenger trains\
  \ entering Wiri Junction on the down -main could only pass straight through the\
  \ \njunction , so the route was always set for Papakura .  After the Manukau Branch\
  \ Line opened a \ntrain controller had to identify a train and its intended route\
  \ , then decide from four possible \noptions  at signal 1803 the end point to select\
  \ for the manual route . \n                                                    \
  \    \n11 A wrong -route is a  signalled route that is not intended for a particular\
  \ train . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2012 -105 4.2.4.  KiwiRail records\
  \ show that  one wrong -route had occurred at the junction three days after the\
  \ \nManukau Branch Line opened , and three more during the 15 days prior to this\
  \ incident.  Each \nof these incidents  had involved a different  but also senior\
  \ and experienced train controller .  \nThis incident was the second wrong -route\
  \ that this train controller had set for trains passing \nsignal 1803 . \n4.2.5.\
  \  To put these errors into perspective, KiwiRail provided operational data  that\
  \ showed Auckland \ntrain controllers were manually setting 26,000 routes  at junctions\
  \ per month .  The statistical \nerror rate was four per month (0.015%).   \n4.2.6.\
  \  According to KiwiRail's research into comparable business work practices, typical\
  \ human error \nrates ranged between 10% and 30% , but for well  managed process\
  \ es they could dr op to \nbetween 5% and 10%.  Accordingly it believed that this\
  \ wrong -route occurrence was \nstatistically insignificant.  While this research\
  \ was not verified, a comparative table provided by \nthe Australian Transport Safety\
  \ Bureau12 confirm ed that the probabili ty for human error in a \nnon-routine operation\
  \ when combined with other duties at the same time was around 10%.  \n4.2.7.  The\
  \ statistics highlight the importance of having defences in place during periods\
  \ of high risk \nto guard against a single human error resulting in an accident.\
  \  In this case a defence against \nthe train controller making an error was the\
  \ train driver (another human) correctly identifying \nand driving to the signals\
  \ . \n4.2.8.  KiwiRail planned  to provide automati c route setting within the train\
  \ control system but could \nnot activate it until the track layout changes at Wiri\
  \ Junction were complete .  The system  \nautomatically links  a train number to\
  \ its scheduled route  for that train's final destination  and \nprovide s interlocking\
  \ along the way with other trains and their routes.   Automatic route setting \n\
  was commissioned across the Auckland metro rail network on 11 June 2013 and has\
  \ since \nreduced the likelihood of a wrong -route being set at the junction.  Manual\
  \ routes a re now only \nset for unscheduled trains (generally freight trains and\
  \ work trains) or if the train running order \nneeds to be adjusted manually after\
  \ an unusual event.   \nFinding s \n1. The train was wrong -routed to Papakura instead\
  \ of Manukau .  The wrong -routing \noccurred during a period when train controllers\
  \ were becoming familiar with the \nnewly  commissioned Manukau Branch Line  and\
  \ were setting routes  manually .   \n2. The altered routine to set a route to Manukau\
  \  manually , coincident with the \nmorning peak train contro l workload , increase\
  \ d the risk of human error . \n \n4.3. Following the wrong route  \n4.3.1.  The\
  \ driver said that he had been getting sufficient sleep and was alert.  This was\
  \ his fourth day \nback at work after being on sick leave for several days in the\
  \ previous week.  He had taken an \nover-the-counter cold relief tablet13 earlier\
  \ in the morning.  T he operator's standard drug and \nalcohol test taken immediately\
  \ after the incident was clear.  The Commission's medical \nconsultant concluded\
  \ that , medically, the driver was fit to be working that day.  \n4.3.2.  The driver\
  \ was qualified with just under two years' expe rience driving trains.  He had no\
  \ \nrecorded history of driving issues .  He  had never experienced a wrong -route\
  \ before.  He was \nfamiliar with the track and signals in the area and with the\
  \ route to and from Manukau.  He \nhad driven there once already that mor ning and\
  \ seven times in the previous three days.  The \ndriver was aware  that his train\
  \  was scheduled for  Manukau and he was aware that signal \n1803 should  have display\
  \ ed a 'proceed at medium speed' (red over green or yellow) when the \npoints were\
  \ set correctl y to the Manukau Branch Line.   However, when he looked up and saw\
  \ \n                                                        \n12 ATSB Human Factors\

  \ Page 13 >>\n the signal aspect change from 'stop' to 'proceed' he did not notice\
  \ that it was to proceed down \nthe wrong route  for hi s train . \n4.3.3.  When\
  \ signal 1803 changed from 'stop' (red over red) to 'caution , proceed at normal\
  \ speed' \n(flashing yellow over red)  the driver  did not comprehend that 'normal\
  \ speed' would have been \ntoo fast (up to 90 km/ h) for his train to take the turn\
  \ -out across to the Manukau Branch Line.  \nNevertheless, he only accelerated his\
  \ tr ain to 'medium speed' (up t o 40 km /h at that point ), \nwhich is an indication\
  \ that the driver only noticed the 'proceed ' aspect and expected to be \nrouted\
  \ across to the Manukau Branch line.   \n4.3.4.  There is further evidence supporting\
  \ the above  hypothesis.   The driver later said that once the \ntrain was moving\
  \ he  had focused on the track ahead and that he would not normally have \nlooked\
  \ at the signal again  until he was almost passing it .  He said that he could not\
  \ recall \nseeing what the route indicator displaye d and thought it was normally\
  \ blank for the down -main \nroute.  In fact the route indicator on signal 1803\
  \ is never blank.  It normally signal s 'D' for the \nstraight -through Papakura\
  \ line, or 'MD' or 'MU' for crossing to the Manukau Branch L ine (refer \nto Figu\
  \ re 7).  When the train controller realised his error and called the driver, the\
  \ train was \napproaching signal 1803.  It is possible that the radio call distracted\
  \ the driver at the time he \nsaid he would normally  have  check ed the signal.\
  \  However, the opport unity to interpret the \nsignal  correctly  was before the\
  \ train left Puhinui Station.  \n4.3.5.  The 'yellow over red ' aspect to which\
  \  signal 1803 changed was the same  signal aspect that \nthe driver had experienced\
  \ at three previous signals along the straight between  Middlemore \nand Puhinui\
  \ Station s.  'Yellow over red ' means 'proceed at normal speed '.  The driver then\
  \ \nproceeded at the lower medium speed limit of 40 km/h, the speed to which he\
  \ was \naccustomed when routed to Manukau.  \n4.3.6.  Train drivers are trained\
  \ to drive to the signals.  Misinterpret ing signals is a  recognised  risk for\
  \ \ntrain drivers.  A technique  that drivers often use to mitigate this risk is\
  \ to 'call the signals' , \nwhere  a driver reads a signal aloud to focus their\
  \ attention on the true meaning of the signal .  \nThis driver said that he did\
  \ not practi se calling signals to himself .   \n4.3.7.  The importance of train\
  \ drivers reading and interpreting signals correctly and not making \nassumptions\
  \ about what lies ahead of their train s cannot be understated .  In this case the\
  \ \ndriver's assumption erred on the side of safety, keeping his speed down to below\
  \ 40 km/h for \na 90 km/h section of track.  However, if the situation were  reversed\
  \ and a Papakura -bound \ntrain was wrong -routed to the Manukau Branch L ine, a\
  \ driver misinterpreting the same signal \ncould result in the train taking the\
  \ cross -over at a dangerously high speed . \nFinding  \n3. The driver assumed \
  \ that the route ahead had been correctly set for  his train .  He \nthen selectively\
  \ read the 'proceed ' aspect of signal 1803 but did not recognise  \nthat it was\
  \ also displaying  the wrong  route  for his train.  \n \n4.4. Recovery  \nSafety\
  \ issue: The radio communication between the train controller and the train driver\
  \ \nwas open loop , and after it had ended neither party really understood the other's\
  \ \nintentions.  \n4.4.1.  The recovery plan to get the train from where it had\
  \ stopped to Manukau should have been  \nroutine  (see Figure 5).  It required the\
  \ train to be moved forward beyond  the points ' \ninterlocking zone , then the\
  \ train controller to use signals to redirect it to the correct route.  \n4.4.2.\
  \  Precise and clear communication between train controllers and train drivers is\
  \ crucial to safe \nrail operations.  The audio records show  that the train control\
  \ ler was anxious to correct his \nmistake  before the train passed signal 1803.\
  \  His first message to the driver was neither \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report\
  \ RO -2012 -105 precise nor clear.   The driver had some difficulty interpreting\
  \  what the train controller had said, \nso he slowed his train and asked  him to\
  \ repeat it.  The train controller then said it was a  \"bit \nlate now \" because\
  \ the train had passed signal 1803 and he described where he would have \npreferred\
  \ the driver to have stopped .   \n4.4.3.  The driver responded more formally in\
  \ an attempt  to clarify the situation .  He  stated his \ninterpretation back to\
  \ the train controller : \"change ends and be prepared to revert back \ntowards\
  \ Puhinui \", and received confirmation from the controller that he  was correct.\
  \  The \ndriver braked at this point and the  train st opped near the points  for\
  \ the Manukau  Branch Line . \n4.4.4.  The train would have  had to return in the\
  \ direction from which it had come in order to be \nrouted to the correct line,\
  \ but how the controller intended to achieve this was not made clear \nto the train\
  \ driver.  The controller intended to reposition the train under the protection\
  \ of \nsignals.  Th e driver was under the impression that he was to set his train\
  \ back far enough \ntowards Puhinui Station so that  it was on the right side of\
  \ signal 1803, and that was what he \ndid. \n4.4.5.  The rules that would have permitted\
  \ such a movement first required a SWA -01 fo rm to be \nissued to the driver and\
  \ communicated to the driver of each train potentially affected by the \nset-back14\
  \ manoeuvre , including the other train that was following and approaching Puhinui\
  \ \nStation.  The driver had been trained in the use of the SWA -01 procedure, but\
  \ had not used  \none in his two years of driving.  He should have been familiar\
  \ enough with the rules to realise \nthat what he was about to do required a SWA\
  \ -01 procedure to be completed before setting his \ntrain back.  More importantly\
  \ , however,  a clear instruction from the train controller would have \nbeen sufficient\
  \ to avert the violation of the rail operating rules for setting back a train towards\
  \ \nan opposing train.  \nCommunication  \n4.4.6.  Clear communication between participants\
  \ in the rail industry is critical to rail safety, \nparticularly when using radio\
  \ , as the parties are likely to be remote from each other  and have \ndifferent\
  \ view s of a situation .  The Commission has previously issued s everal \nrecommendations\
  \ to the rail industry arising from its inquiries after finding  that poor \nstandards\
  \ of communication and crew resource management  have been factors contributing\
  \ \nto accidents and incidents15.  Crew resource management16 is where rail part\
  \ icipants make \nuse of all the resources available to ensure they all work with\
  \ consistent information to ensure \na successful execution of the plan/task.  For\
  \ this to be achieved the participants must have a \nclear understand ing of  instructions,\
  \ communicate s uccinctly and engage multiple minds to \nensure that operations\
  \ are conducted safely.  \n4.4.7.  For example , the Commission found that unclear\
  \ radio conversations contributed to a hi -rail \nvehicle nearly being struck by\
  \ a passenger train at Paerata (TAIC, 2011 A)  and a freight train \nbeing wrong\
  \ -routed at Wiri Junction (TAIC, 2011 ) .  Following these two incidents the \n\
  Commission made the following recommendation to the Chief Executive of the N Z Transport\
  \ \nAgency , on 28 March 2012:  \nThe Commission recommends to the Chief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport Age ncy that he \nrequire the Executive of the National Rail\
  \ System Standards to ensure that all rail participants \nmeet a consistently high\
  \ level of crew resource manageme nt and communications that \nincludes the use\
  \ of standard rail phraseology (002/12) . \n4.4.8.  This incident is an example\
  \  showing  there is still room for improvement in the way some  rail \nparticipants\
  \ are communicating . \n                                                       \
  \ \n14 Set-back is t he process of reversing a train , \n15 Examples are safety\
  \ recommendation 002/12 and reports 07 -108, 08 -110 and 11 -101.  \n16 KiwiRail\
  \ has named the concept 'non -technical skills'.  \nFinal report RO -2012 -105 \n\
  << Page 15 >>\n 4.4.9.  The safety recommendation is still open and the NZ Transport\
  \ Agency is running a project to \nmeet the intent of the recommendation.  For that\
  \ reason t he Commission has  not made a new \nrecommendation to the regulator to\
  \ address this safety issue.  \nFindings  \n4. The train was driven back towards\
  \ Puhinui Station  without the required protection \nfrom other train movements,\
  \ which created a head -on situation with another \npassenger train.  \n5. Miscommunication\
  \ between the train driver and the train controller resulted in \neach having a\
  \ different understanding of how the tra in would be recovered  to its \ncorrect\
  \ route . \n6. The miscommunication between the driver and the train controller\
  \ arose from  a \ncasual and  ambiguous conversation  at a time when a set of clear\
  \ and precise \ninstructions should have been issued . \n \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
