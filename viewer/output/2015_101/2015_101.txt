The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.   Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to impro ve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. Morningside Station in Auckland consists of an ‘island platform’ where the north bound  and 
southbound rail tracks pass either side of the platform.  At one end of the platform 
pedestrians  have to walk down a fenced ramp to join a pedestrian level crossing , which  is part 
of the Morningside Drive road level crossing.  At the bottom of the  platform ramp pedestrians  
have to turn either left or right to cross the relevant rail track.  
1.2. At 1840 o n 29 January 2015 , a person  alighted from a passenger train at Morningside 
Station.  The person  walked alone along the station platform to an electronic fare-payment 
device , where he recorded the end of his journey.  
1.3. The train from which he had just alighted  departed the station.  Meanwhile, another train 
travelling in the opposite direction was approaching the station on the other track.  
1.4. The person  walked down the platform ramp and turned right , passing through an unguarded 
opening , and stepped out in front of the approaching train.  The train struck the person, who 
was fatally injured.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission ) found that t he train was being 
driven at below the maximum line speed  and that the barriers and warning devices for the 
adjacent Morningside Drive road level crossing were working correctly.   However, there was 
insufficient protection at the bottom of the p latform r amp to prevent pedestrian s inadvertently 
walking out in fro nt of trains.  
1.6. The Commission also found  that it was very likely that the pedestrian was distracted by the 
use of his mobile phone when he stepped out in front of the train.  
1.7. Early in the inquiry the Commission made three urgent recommendations  to the Chief 
Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to liaise with the relevant parties to:  
 upgrade the protection arrangements for pedestrians exiting the station platform onto the 
pedestrian level  crossing at Morningside Station  
 clarify who is responsible for controlli ng and protecting pedestrians as they cross the 
boundaries between railway stations and the rail corridor in the Auckland metro network  
 review all pedestrian level  crossings in the Auckland metro network and ensure that they 
have a level of protection commensurate with the level of risk currently and in the 
immediate future.  
1.8. A fourth recommendation  was subsequently made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency  that he  liaise with KiwiRail  New Zealand Limited  and road control ling a uthorities t o 
address the safety issue whereby currently  many  pedestrian level crossings located in 
provincial areas do not meet the guidelines laid down by the NZ Transport Agency . 
1.9. A key lesson  arising from the inquiry  relates to  the use of  mobile devices by pedestrian s, which  
has been found to make them less aware of hazards around them .  Rail operators and 
providers of rail infrastructure must factor this into their risk assessments when designing 
safety into rail infrastructure.

 Final report RO -2015 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 29 January 2015 the NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission  (Commission)  of the accident under section 13 (4) of the Railways Act 2005.  The 
Commission gathe red further information , then on 3 February 2015 opened an inquiry under 
section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an 
investigator in charge . 
2.2. An investigator travelled to Morningside on 9 February 2015 where he  conducted a site 
investigation.  The investigator and the Chief Investigator of Accidents interviewed two 
Transdev  Auckland Limited (Transdev)  train drivers and representatives from Auckland 
Transport the next day.  The investigator travelled in the drivi ng compartment of a Waitākere -
bound passenger train to record  on camera the short journey from Kingsland Station to 
Morningside Station , which included travelling over the Morningside Drive level crossing s1. 
2.3. The investigat or visited 11 other island platform stations with ramps leading to pedestrian 
level crossings to assess the various layouts and safeguards installed .  The investigator also 
visited t hree similar island platform stations with ramps connected to pedestrian crossings 
within the Wellington metro2 network  for the same reasons . 
2.4. The Commission obtained recorded data from the Waitākere -bound train’s event recorder, the 
signalling system  that showed the precise times when  the two train s travelled across the 
Morningside Drive level crossing s, and the closed -circuit television system at Morningside 
Station  that showed the pedestrian’s movements .  The three data streams were synchronised 
and used to determine the sequence of events leading up to the accident.  
2.5. The investigator also obta ined a number of records and documents pertaining to the  accident : 
 the train driver ’s recent performance records  
 historical records for the level crossing that included the dates of previous pedestrian 
accidents  
 lease agreements between Auckland Transport and KiwiRail New Zealand Limited 
(KiwiRail) pertaining to Morningside Station and environs  
 assessment reports and working group meeting minutes referencing the Morningside 
Drive level crossing s 
 engineering records of the warning systems i nstalled for both vehic ular and pedestrian 
movements over the Morningside Drive level crossing s 
 the NZ Transport Agency’s Traffic Control Devices Manual  – Part 9  – Level Crossings  and 
KiwiRail’s Operations Group Infrastructure Code Supplement /Company Procedure for level 
crossings.  
2.6. On 27 August 2015  the Commission issued three urgent recommendations to the Chief 
Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to address safety issues identified early in the inquiry . 
2.7. On 22 June 2016  the Commission approved a draft report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.8. Written submissions were received from five of the interested parties during July 2016.  The 
Commission has considered the submissions , and changes as a result of t hose submissions 
have been included in the final report.  
 
                                                        
1 A level crossing is a position where a railway line and a public or private road or public or private pedestrian 
walkway cross paths on the same level . 
2 Metro is a term used globally to describe an urban rail passenger system .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  Morningside Station is an island platform, with the usual track for Britomart -bound trains 
passing to the east of the platform and the usual track for Waitākere -bound trains passing on 
the opposite , west side of the platform.  The Morningside Drive level crossing intersects both 
these tracks and a siding track close to the eastern end of the station platform.  The level 
crossing is protected by flashing lights, bells and barrier arms directed at road and pedestrian 
traffic following Morningside Drive.  
3.1.2.  The station platform transforms into a fenced p latform  ramp at its eastern  end leading down 
to a ‘T’ intersection with one of two pedestrian level crossings for Morningside Drive.  The bells 
for the Morningside Drive level crossing are audible under usual circumstances to pedestrians 
walking down the ramp to j oin the pedestrian  level crossing.  
3.1.3.  The flashing lights and barrier arms, however, are directed at vehicle drivers and pedestrians 
who are following Morningside Drive.  The only visual cue warn ing pedestrians walking down 
the platform ramp  to ‘look for trai ns’ is a yellow sign.  
3.1.4.  At 1840 on 29 January 2015, a 24-year-old male (the pedestrian) alighted from a Britomart -
bound  Transdev passenger train at Morningside Station platform.  
3.1.5.  The pedestrian walked alone along the platform to the eastern -end electronic ticket register , 
where he recorded his  fare payment at 1841.  He then walked down the platform ramp 
leading to the Morningside Drive  pedestrian  level crossing (see Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1

3.1.6.  The Britomart -bound train from which  the pedestrian had alighted depart ed the station on the 
southbound track.  It travelled over  and had moved clear of  the Morningside Drive level 
crossing s by 1841:09.  Twelve seconds later , a Waitākere -bound passenger train travelling in 
the opposite direction on the northbound track arrived at the level crossing s travelling at 42 
kilometres per hour ( km/h ).

 Final report RO -2015 -101 3.1.7.  Meanwhile t he pedestrian had walked to the end of the p latform ramp, during which time he 
was facing the direction of the approaching  Waitākere -bound train.  He turned right through an 
opening and stepped out in front of the train .  The  train struck the pedestrian at 1841:24 and 
he was fatally injured . 
3.1.8.  The pedestrian ’s movements were captured by  several of  the platform -mounted closed -circuit 
television cameras.   He was seen to be using his mobile phone while he walked  down the 
platform  ramp and he had bud -style earphones inserted in his ears .  The earphones were 
connected to his mobile phone.  
3.1.9.  Data recorders  showed that the flashing lights, audible bells and physical barriers at the 
Morningside Drive road level crossing were operating correctly and continuously for both 
train s.  The Waitākere -bound train was being driven  at below the maximum line speed and the 
driver used the train whistle appropriately to warn pedestrians that the train was approaching .

 Final report RO -2015 -101 3.2. Morningside Drive level crossing  
3.2.1.  The Morningside Drive level crossing comprise d one road way and two pedestrian footpaths 
that flank ed the roadway  (see Figure 2) .  All three crossed  both main line tracks and a siding 
track close to the  eastern end of the station platform.  
3.2.2.  Mazes had been  installed at the four entrances to the two pedestrian level crossing s during 
1986 .  The mazes had been  upgra ded in 2011.   The m azes were designed to channel 
pedestrians along a nominal two-metre  distance towards the direction that trains would 
normally approach the level crossing  (see Figure 3) .

3.3. The train driver  
3.3.1.  The train driver underwent a post -accident drug and alcohol test in accordance with 
Transdev’s policy and procedures.  The test results were positive for cannabinoids.  Further 
laboratory analysis provided a positive result for cannabis.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The following analysis discusses what happened in this case, then moves to a discussion of 
three  broader safety issues:  
 the lack of active warnings protecting pedestrians using the Morningside Road 
pedestrian  level  crossing when leavi ng Morningside Station  
 the lack of clarity over who is responsible for safety and control at the boundaries 
between station platforms and the rail corridor in Auckland  
 the ability of the risk assessment process for pedestrian level crossings to keep pace 
with infrastructure changes and increasing patronage on metro passenger trains . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The weather  at the time of the accident was fine and clear .  The sun was behind the 
pedestrian after he alighted from his train , so it was very unlikely to have obscured the train 
from the pedestrian ’s view .  There was no one else walking on the platform ramp at the time 
and there were no fixed structures that would have totally obstructed his view of the train.  
4.2.2.  The train had its forward -facing upper and lower headlights illuminated.  The lower headlights 
were known as ‘ditch’ lights  and were mounted low down on each side of the driv ing trailer.  
They flash ed alternate ly for 20 seconds  whenever the train whistle was sounded  in order to 
draw atten tion to the train’s  presence.  These lights were operational and would have been 
flashing for the eight -second  period from when the driver first sounded the train whistle  until 
the time of the accident.   Therefore , a clear view of the train headlights  would have been  
available to the pedestrian had he been looking in that direction . 
4.2.3.  The barrier arms and warning lights and bells for the road level crossing were operating at the 
time.  The lights were directed at road users rather than pedestrians walking  down the 
platform ramp, so these would not have been visible to  the pedestrian.  
4.2.4.  The level crossing warning bells would have been audible to peopl e in the vicinity of the 
platform ramp .  The train from which  the pedestrian had just alighted had just depart ed the 
platform at the time he started walking down the platform ramp.  It would have been  possible 
for a person to assume that the road level crossing warning devices were for the departing 
train and not appreciate that they were also for the train coming  from the opposite direction.  
It would have been equally possible that the noise of the departing train partially masked the 
sound of the warning bells.  It was not possible to determine whether these  were  factor s in 
this accident.  
4.2.5.  The train whistle was first sounded when the train was 137 m etres  and the pedestrian about 
10 m etres  from the level crossing.  The train would then have been visible to the pedestrian.  
4.2.6.  The train driver sounded a second and longer blast on the train  whistle when he saw the 
pedes trian make a 90-degree  turn and enter the level crossing without hesitation.  The train 
was then about 25 m etres  and the pedestrian about 2 .5 metres  from the accident site.  The 
train struck the pedestrian two seconds later.  
The pedestrian was very likely distracted by his mobile phone  
4.2.7.  It is very likely that the train whistle would have been audible to the pedestrian.  However, t he 
pedestrian  was wearing small , bud-type earphones connected to a mobile phone  he was 
carrying at waist  level .  He w as seen to be  using his  mobile phone while he walked down the 
platform  ramp leading to the pedestrian level crossing.   It was not possible to establish 
whether sound was emitting from the earphones.  The possibility of sound emitting from his 
earphones masking the sound of the level crossing warning devices and the train whistle 
could not be excluded . 
 

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -101 4.2.8.  The use of mobile devices  by pedestrians  has been found to make them less aware of hazards 
around them. A research paper written by Marc Green (Green, M (2004) ), Inattentional 
Blindness and Conspicuity , found that “mobile -phone -using pedestrians were less likely to 
notice other obj ects in their environment ; they were also less likely to look for traffic  before 
starting to cross a road  or street ”.  This finding can equally be applied to pedestrian s crossing  
a railway  track  and is very likely to have been a factor in the present case . 
Use of performance -impairing drugs  
4.2.9.  The driver undertook a drug and alcohol screening test  following the accident , which returned 
a positive result for cannabinoids.   The Commission could not determine whether drug 
impairment was a factor contributing to this accident.  However, event recorders showed that 
the train was being driven at below the maximum line speed and the driver used the train 
whistle appropriately to warn pedestrians  that the train was approaching .  The driver could not 
have done anything  further to prevent the accident.  
4.2.10.  Nevertheless, the use of performance -impairing drugs by a driver of a passenger train is a 
serious safety issue.   Both Transdev and the NZ Transport Agency have taken action to 
address this issue (refer to Section 6 , Safety actions ).  The Commission has issued two 
recommendations  (007/133 dated April 2013 and 012/134 dated October 2013) regarding 
the use of performance -impairing drugs by anyone who has a safety -critical role in the 
aviation, rail or maritime transport  industr y.  The positive test for cannabis for this train driver 
further highlights the need for the rail industry to address this safety issue.  
Findings  
1. It is very likely that the pedestrian was distracted while using  his mobile phone 
when he stepped out in front of the train.  
2. The train was being driven at an appropriate speed and the driver did all he 
could in the time available to warn the pedestrian  that the train was 
approaching . 
4.3. Morningside Drive pedestrian level crossing  
Safety issue  – There were no active visual alarms or physical barriers to prevent pedestrians 
exiting the Morningside Station platform and inadvertently entering the Morningside Drive 
pedestrian level crossing when trains approach ed. 
4.3.1.  Morning side Station was one of 20 stations in  Auckland where the train tracks ran either side 
of an island platform.  
4.3.2.  Auckland Transport figures showed that passenger numbers through Morningside Station had 
increased by about 25% between 2013 and 2015 , but the station was ranked only 35th on its 
list of 41 stations in terms of overall passenger numbers during 2015.  
4.3.3.  Subways that enable pedestrians to walk under , and bridges that enable pedestrians to walk 
over the tracks provide a good  safeguard to segre gate pedestrians from trains.   There was o ne 
subway at Morningside Station , located  at the western end of the station ( refer  Figure 2).

Final report RO -2015 -101 
<< Page 9 >>
 4.3.4.  Auckland Transport figures showed that 20% of its passengers at Morningside  Station  used 
the subway between January an d April 2015.   The other 80% of the passengers at 
Morningside station used the platform ramp at the east ern end of the station , which was 
where this accident occurred . 
4.3.5.  As previously mentioned , the use of mobile phones and other devices while on the move is 
commonplace.  It is very likely that the pedestrian looking at, and possibly listening to, his 
mobile phone was a factor contributing to the accident.   Transport operators need to factor  in 
this risk when considering the protection of the travelling public.  
4.3.6.  In this case t he only visual cue installed on the platform ramp to warn pedestrians was the 
yellow sign warning them  to ‘look for trains’ as provided for in the NZ Transport Agency’s 
Traffic  Control Devices Manual  – Part 9  – Level Crossings  (see Figure 4).  There were no active 
visual warning lights or barriers installed on the platform ramp  to prevent people inadvertently 
stepping out in front of a train . 
 
Figure 4  
NZ Transport Agency ’s ‘look for trains’ sign 
4.3.7.  KiwiRail’s records show ed that there had been no accidents between trains and motor 
vehicles at the Morningside Drive road level crossing since 1965, the year th e barriers were 
installed.  Therefore , the activation of the barrier arms, together with the illuminated flashing 
lights and audible alarms , had been an effective safeguard in preventing motor vehicles 
entering the level crossing . 
4.3.8.  In contrast , there had been one pedestrian fatality (in 2002 ) and se veral reported near misses  
since pedestrian mazes were installed  in 1986 .  All of the pedestrian accidents/incidents  
occurred at the same pedestrian level crossing where this accident occurred and all involved 
Waitākere -bound trains travelling on the northbound track . 
4.3.9.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency  that he liaise with Auckland Transport to install some  form of active warning device or 
barrier at the Morningside Drive pe destrian level  crossin g. 
4.3.10.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied in part as follows:  
KiwiRail and Auckland Transport are working on a solution to address the 
identified safety issues at the pedestrian level crossings at Morningside Station 
in We st Auckland. The Transport Agency is actively monitoring this situation to 
ensure the resolution is implemented in an effective and timely manner.  
4.3.11.  On 27 July 2016 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency provided an update on 
progress.  Refer to Section 7, Recommendations, for the full response.  
Findings  
3. The active barriers, lights and audible alarms for the Morningside Road level 
crossing were operating correctly.  
4. There was insufficient protection at the Morningside Station p latform  ramp to 
preven t pedestrians inadvertently entering the rail corridor in front of 
approaching trains.

 Final report RO -2015 -101 4.4. Responsibility for protecting pedestrians  
Safety issue – The regulatory and operational accountabilities of the Auckland metro system 
do not expressly deal with responsibility for safety and control at the boundar ies between 
station platforms and the rail corridor.  
4.4.1.  During this inquiry it became apparent  that there was uncertainty about  what entity  was 
responsib le for protecting pedestrians at the boundar ies between station platforms and the 
rail corridor.  
4.4.2.  KiwiRail is required to have a rail licence and an approved ‘ Safety Case5’ outlining its rail 
activities  under the Railways Act 2005 .  KiwiRail has a resultant safety system that details 
how it will operate safely in accordance with its Safety Case. 
4.4.3.  KiwiRail considered that it owned and controlled all pedestrian level crossings in New Zealand, 
including those on the Auckland and Wellington metro networks  in its Safety Case dated 1 
August 2013 .  Pedestrian lev el crossing boundaries were recorded .  However, t he Safety Case 
did not consider who controlled the movement of pedestrians across the boundaries.  
4.4.4.  KiwiRail’s safety system6 was not explicit on who was responsible for, and who controlled , the 
boundaries between the rail corridor and adjacent land owners, which in the case of 
Morningside Drive was Auckland Transport.  KiwiRail explained i n a submission dated 17 June 
2015 that it considered Auckland Transport to be  responsible for controllin g safety at the 
boundary of the two open entrances at the Morningside Drive Up pedestrian level crossing.   
Auckland Transport did not agree.  
4.4.5.  Auckland Transport is the owner of the Auckland metro passenger trains and also lease s the 
railway stations in the Auckland metro network  from KiwiRail.  Auckland Transport is deemed 
to be a rail participant as defined in section 4 of the Railways Act 2005.  When th at Act 
became law, the predecessor of the NZ Transport Agency7 advised the predecessor of 
Auckland Transp ort8 that it was not a rail operator . 
4.4.6.  Consequently,  Auckland Transport has neither applied for a rail licence nor applied for an 
exemption.  Safety issues pertaining to the Auckland metro passenger services are managed 
through the licences and approved Safety Cases of Transdev Auckland Limited , which 
operate s the trains , and Construccioes y Auxilar de Ferrocarriles , which built and currently 
maintain s the electric trains.  
4.4.7.  Auckland Transport and KiwiRail  had different understandings about their respective 
responsibilities and obligations in relation to safety controls at pedestrian level crossing 
boundaries.  Consequently , the parties were  operating on differing understandings about their 
responsibilities in relation to this issue.  
4.4.8.  The Commission considers th ere were  differences between KiwiRail’s Safety Case and the 
lease agreements that gave rise to uncertainty.  In particular, the lease agreements gave a 
broad overview of which stakeholder held safety responsibilities for the Morningside Drive 
level crossings, but did not expressly articulate which party (or parties) was responsible for 
controlling and protecting pedestrians as they cross ed the boundaries between railway 
stations and the rail corridor.

 4.4.9.  Therefore, on 30 July 2015, the Commission reco mmended  to the Chief Executive of the NZ 
Transport Agency that he take the necessary steps to remove any uncertainty.  
4.4.10.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied as follows:  
While the Transport Agency gives the Commission an un dertaking to implement 
this recommendation, we must first consider the statutory and regulatory options 
in which to do this.  This will involve engaging with a number of relevant parties in 
a process that will take time.  We will advise the Commission of o ur progress in 
due course.  
4.5. Risk assessments for pedestrian level crossings  
Safety issue  – The level of protection for people using pedestrian level crossings in the 
Auckland metro network is currently  inadequate  because the risk assessment process for 
pedestrian level  crossings is not keeping pace with the infrastructure changes and increasing 
patronage.  
4.5.1.  There are 52 level crossings in the Auckland metro network that can be used by pedestrians.  
These  level  cross ings are equipped with a mixture of active and passive warning devices.  
Records show ed that there were 13 other pedestrian accidents within the Auckland metro 
network and five accidents within the Wellington metro network between 1 January 2006 and 
30 Jan uary 2015.  
4.5.2.  In 2007 KiwiRail and the NZ Transport Agency had adopted a computer -based application to 
assess and rank risk levels at road and pedestrian level crossings , known as the Australian 
Level Crossing Assessment Model (ALCAM) .  KiwiRail and road controlling authorities use 
ALCAM  to prioritise upgrade work  at level crossings . 
4.5.3.  To make an assessment of a pedestrian level crossing, data is gathered relating to the 
number of trains that travel over the crossing , the number of pedestrians who use the  
crossi ng, and the level of protection provided at the crossing.  Substantial changes in other 
data used to make the assessment  will warrant a new risk assessment being undertaken  for 
that level crossing.  
4.5.4.  Record s also show ed that monthly passenger numbers on the Auckland network increased 
from 300,000  in July 2005 to 1 .5 million i n March 2015 .  These figures compare closely with 
Auckland Transport ’s forecast  increase made in the early 2000s.  Auckland Transport and 
KiwiRail ha d undertaken the following upgr ades to the metro network  in recent years  in 
preparation for the  planned increase in passenger numbers : 
 most of the network had been  multi -tracked  
 new lines to Onehunga and Manukau had been  constructed  
 a new bi-directional signalling system had been commissioned that allow ed trains to use  
either line in multi -tracked areas  at normal speed  
 new electric multiple unit passenger trains  had been introduced after the installation of a 
new electric overhead system  
 the North Auckland Line  peak-hour passenger train frequency  had been increased  to four 
trains per hour  in each direction  
 the maximum train speeds had been increased by between 10 km/h  and 30 km/h.  
4.5.5.  On 9 May 2016 Auckland Transport  further increase d the passenger train frequency on the 
North Auckland Line from four  to six trains per hour in each direction during the morning and  
afternoon peak -hour operations , and from two to three trains per hour during the inter -peak 
periods .  The total number of trains per week day on the line rose from  101 to 138 Monday to 
Thursday , and to 145 on Friday s. 
  
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -101 4.5.6.  Using the Morningside Drive level crossing as an example, the first ALCAM assessment was 
undertaken during May 2007.  The site assessment was not repeated until  December 2014, 
seven weeks  before the accident.  During  those seven and a half  years’  significant changes 
occurr ed in the Auckland metro system  that resulted in changes to the parameters that were 
used in making the first risk assessment.  During that same period the ALCAM database  was 
only updated for the number of trains per day travelling over the level crossing, which was only 
one of many parameters that were changing.  The ALCAM risk process was not keeping pace 
with the changes affecting safety at the Morningside Drive level c rossing.  
4.5.7.  An ALCAM  National Statistical Report , jointly published by KiwiRail and the NZ Transport 
Agency in March 2013 , stated that the pedestrian accident risk was about 10 times higher in 
the Auckland and Wellington regions than in  the rest of the country.  The report concluded  that 
the increased risk was due to metro systems operating in both cities.  
4.5.8.  Auckland Transport’s d raft Regional Land Transport Plan 2015 -2025 recognised that rail 
infrastructure investment was needed to addres s safety issues at level crossings .  However,  
the report did not elaborate on the nature of those safety issues and how they would be 
addressed.  
4.5.9.  An example of how the changes to the rail infrastructure have potentially compromised 
pedestrian safety is the design of existing pedestrian mazes .  The NZ Transport Agency’s 
Traffic Control Devices Manual – Part 9  – Level Crossings  states that mazes  have been 
constructed to force pedestrians to face in the direction of approaching trains before they turn 
and cross the tracks.  With the ability for trains in the Auckland metro area to be routed in 
either direction along bi -directional lines, trains co uld now potentially be approaching from 
behind pedestrians.  
4.5.10.  The speed of change within the Auckland metro  system means it is very likely  that the current 
frequency of and output from  ALCAM risk assessments will not meet the safety requirements 
at pedestria n level crossings .  Although the rate of change in Wellington is slower, similar 
issues are  very likely to arise there also.  
4.5.11.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission issued an urgent recommendation to the Chief Executive of 
the NZ Transport Agency that he address th is safety issue . 
4.5.12.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied in part as follows:  
Throughout New Zealand, a wide range of level crossing -related activities and 
work is being undertaken by a variety of rail participants and agenc ies. This work 
encompasses level crossing infrastructure, planning, funding, risk review and risk 
mitigation.  
4.6. Other pedestrian level crossing s 
Safety issue – A large percentage of pedestrian level crossing s located in provincial areas do 
not fully conform with guidelines within  the NZ Transport Agency ’s Traffic  Control Devices 
Manual – Part 9 – Level Crossings . 
4.6.1.  Three further level crossing  accidents , involving two pedestrians and a cyclist , occurred in 
other  regions during the period  of this investigation : 
 on 6 August 2015  a pedestrian was fatally injured after being struck by a Papakura -bound 
Transdev passenger train at Walters Road pedestrian level crossing  in South Auckland  
 on 11 January 2016  a pedestrian was fatally injured after being struck by a KiwiRa il 
freight locomotive at Weymouth Street pedestrian level crossing in New Plymouth  
 on 11 February 2016 a cyclist was fatally injured after being struck b y a KiwiRail freight 
train at Fendalton Road  pedestrian level crossing in Christchurch.  
  
 
Final report RO -2015 -101 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.6.2.  The ALCAM Nat ional Statistical Report , published during March 2013,  showed that in New 
Zealand there was an annual average of eight  fatal /serious injuries to motor vehicle 
occupants involved in level crossing accidents .  During the same period covered in the report 
there was an annual average of three  fatal/serious injuries to pedestrians involved in level 
crossing accidents.  
4.6.3.  The r eport also stated that of 605 pedestrian level crossing s on KiwiRail’s provincial network , 
50% were located near schools  and 77% did not conform  fully with the NZ Transport Agency ’s 
Traffic Control Devices Manual – Part 9  – Level Crossings .  The manual contains a suite of 
guidelines within the traffic control devices manual prepared by the NZ Transport Agency and 
used by rail providers and road controlling authorities that have road and pedestrian level 
crossings within their jurisdictions . 
4.6.4.  However, t he NZ Transport Agency advised  that currently minor non -conformance s, for 
example  a narrow line marking , can trigger the ‘non -compliance flag’ within the survey process 
and the ALCAM reports do not  explain or itemise what the specific non -compliance s might be.  
Consequently, the nature of the non -conformances, as indicated in the 2013 ALCAM Level 
Crossing Sta tistical Report , are not fully understood . 
4.6.5.  Therefore , the Commission is recommend ing to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency  that he liaise with KiwiRail and relevant road control ling authorities to assess and 
confirm which provincial level crossings have significant safety issues that  do not align with  
the NZ Transport Agency’s Traffic Control Devices  Manual – Part 9  – Level Crossings , then 
work with the  authorities to  ensure safety improvements are prioritised and implemented . 
Finding s 
5. Uncertainty existed over which entity was responsible for controlling pedestrian 
movements between station platforms and the rail corridor in the Auckland 
metro network . 
6. The process for assessing risk s at pede strian level crossings  around the 
Auckland , and to a lesser extent  the Wellington , rail corridors has not kept up 
with the pace of change in these rail systems.  
7. Seventy -seven  percent of pedestrian level crossings in KiwiRail’s provincial  
network did  not conform fully  with the NZ Transport Agency ’s Traffic Control 
Devices Manual – Part 9  – Level Crossing s.  However, the extent of  the non -
conformances has not been fully analysed . 
 
 
 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -101 5. Findings  
5.1. It is very likely that the pedestrian was distracted while using  his mobile phone when he 
stepped out in front of the train.  
5.2. The train was being driven at an appropriate speed  and the driver did all he could in the time 
available to warn the pedestrian  that the train was approaching . 
5.3. The active barriers, lights and aud ible alarms for the Morningside Road level crossing were 
operating correctly.  
5.4. There was insufficient protection at the Morningside Station p latform  ramp to prevent 
pedestrians inadvertently entering the rail corridor in front of approaching trains.  
5.5. Uncerta inty existed over which entity was responsible for controlling pedestrian movements 
between station platforms and the rail corridor in the Auckland metro network . 
5.6. The process for assessing risk s at pedestrian level crossings  around the Auckland , and to a 
lesser extent  the Wellington , rail corridors has not kept up with  the pace of change in these rail 
systems.  
5.7. Seventy -seven  percent of pedestrian level  crossings in KiwiRail’s provincial network did  not 
conform fully  with the N Z Transport Agency’s Traffic Control Devices Manual – Part 9  – Level 
Crossing s.  However, the extent of  the non -conformances has not been fully analysed .

 6. Safety a ctions  
6.1. General  
6.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
6.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2.1.  On 17 June 2015 Auckland Transport advised by email that it had requested its Acting Health 
and Sa fety Manager (City Rail Link Rail Safety and Assurance Manager) to carry out a risk 
assessment after the fatality at Morningside Station and a near miss soon afterwards at the 
same  level  crossing.  The following three recommendations were suggested  followi ng that 
assessment : 
 short term: provide a crossing keeper  to help educate passengers on safety at level 
crossings  
 medium term: provide electronic pedestrian gating off the platform  
 long term: investigate grade separation/pedestrian bridge options.  
6.2.2.  On 19 Ma y 2016  Auckland Transport advise d that the following safety actions had been taken  
at the Morningside Drive level crossings in conjunction with KiwiRail and the NZ Transport 
Agency before the passenger train frequency increase on the North Auckland Line between 
Newmarket and Swanson:  
 new level crossing ‘keep track clear ’ signage installed at the pedestrian mazes  
 vegetation cleared from around the level crossing perimeters  
 road markings upgraded on the road surface at the boundaries and over the level 
crossing 
 general signage reviewed and improved  
 flexi-median post installed to prevent motor vehicle s overtaking on the approaches to the 
level crossing.  
6.3. Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
6.3.1.  Transdev signed off a random drug and alcohol testing policy on 29 April 2016.  
6.3.2.  On 23 June 2016 Transdev advised that it had taken the following actions in regard to the 
train driver having tested positive for cannabinoids in his system:  
 the train driver attended a Transdev -sponsored drug and alcohol rehabilitation 
program me during a six -week stand -down period after the accident  
 the train driver returned a negative test for cannabinoids in his system at the end of his 
rehabilitation on 11 March 2015  
 the train driver returned to driving duties on 12 March 2015 . 
6.3.3.  The NZ Transport Agency’s Rail Safety team conducted a review of Transdev ’s guidelines, 
policies and procedures pertaining to drug and alcohol use by employees  upon notification 
that the train driver had tested positive for performance -impairing drugs .  The review 
examined Transdev’s Safety Case and safety system documentation to ensure  that its 
processes were being adhered to and were fit for purpose.  
 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -101 6.3.4.  The NZ Transport Agency’s findings were as follows:  
 Transdev ’s independent investigation of the Morningside fatality, which included 
discussions with staff who dealt with the train driver on the day, and the management 
team who supervised him generally, suggested  that the train driver ’s behaviour provided 
no indicatio n that he had been undertaking his role while under the influence of either 
drugs or alcohol  
 Transdev was adhering to its guidelines, policies and procedures pertaining to drug and 
alcohol use by employees, and as outlined in its Safety Case and safety sys tem, but they 
were not well defined or concise  
 Transdev h ad a multi -layered approach for mitigating the risk of drug and alcohol use by 
staff performing safety -critical roles , which it believed was controlling the risk to “as low 
as reasonably practicable” .  The proposed introduction of random testing would be a 
further important layer that would act as a deterrent, and may identify staff who had not 
come to attention for drug and alcohol use by any other means  
 Transdev did not have a system for employees t o discreetly report concerns relating to 
serious wrong -doings that could act as a further layer to mitigate the risk.

 7. Recommendations  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission may make such reports and recommendations to transport sector regulator s 
as may be necessary in the interests of transport safety, and give notice of those 
recommendations to any other person or organisation as it considers appropriate. In this case 
recommendations have been made to the NZ Transport Agency, as the rail regula tory body, 
with notice of the recommendations issued to KiwiRail, Auckland Transport and Transdev.  
7.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these urgent recommendations are 
implemented without delay to help prevent similar accidents or in cidents occurring in the 
future.  
7.2. Recommendation one  
Safety issue – There  were no active visual alarms or physical barriers to prevent pedestrians 
exiting the Morningside Station platform and inadvertently entering the Morningside Drive Up 
pedestrian level crossing when trains approached.  
7.2.1.  The active warning lights, bells and barrier arms protecting the Morningside Drive level 
crossing are positioned to warn vehicle drivers and pedestrians on Morningside Drive.  
Pedestrians exiting Morningside Station platform to the south have only a yellow sign 
reminding them to ‘look for trains’.  The platform pedestrian egress can be used by a high 
number of passengers during peak periods.  
7.2.2.  There has been  one previous pedestrian fatality at the Morningside Drive leve l crossing , in 
2002.  On 8 April 2015 the driver of a Waitākere -bound passenger train said that his train had 
missed two pedestrians by about one metre at the same pedestrian intersection.  Anecdotal 
information received by the Commission indicates that si milar near -miss incidents are very 
likely to  have gone unreported.  All of the reported incidents involved Waitākere -bound trains 
at the same pedestrian  level  crossing.  
7.2.3.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission recommend ed to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency that in the interests of passenger and pedestrian safety he liaise with the appropriate 
authorities to ensure that they address the safety issue whereby some form of active warning 
device or barrier is installed that will prevent pedestrians inadvert ently stepping out in front of 
trains when entering or exiting the Morningside Station platform. (010/15)  
7.2.4.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied : 
KiwiRail and Auckland Transport are working on a solution to addr ess the 
identified safety issues at the pedestrian level crossings at Morningside Station 
in West Auckland. The Transport Agency is actively monitoring this situation to 
ensure the resolution is implemented in an effective and timely manner.  
We cannot yet provide a definitive timeframe for when these changes will be 
completed but give an undertaking to update the Commission once the next 
stages of this work have been determined by KiwiRail and Auckland Transport.  
7.2.5.  On 27 July 2016, the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied further : 
A number of safety improvements have now been completed at Morningside 
Drive which fulfil the intent of the recommendation and will help ensure 
pedestrians do not inadvertently step out in front of trains whe n entering or 
exiting the Morningside station platform.  The safety improvements are:  
 the installation, testing and commissioning of eight automatic gates at 
each crossing point.  
 the main lines have been installed with STRAIL flangeless rubbers.  
 new mazes.  
 supplementary lights and bells have been installed at each new maze.  
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -101  the footpaths have been re -aligned from 70  degrees to 85/90  degrees.  
 the main road has been made smaller to accommodate the change to 
the footpath.  
 moving of the HAB/FLBs [warning device s], allow ing the footprint of the 
maze foundations to be moved to allow the pedestrian crossings to be 
moved from a 70-degree  angle towards a 90 -degree angle, thus 
allowing the mobility and wheelchair units to cross more safely, i.e. a 
more direct (perpend icular) route tha n at an oblique angle, which 
reduces the risk of the mobility device wheels becoming stuck in the 
gaps.  
7.2.6.  The NZ Transport Agency is currently awaiting confirmation from KiwiRail and Auckland 
Transport that some minor outstanding work has been completed . 
7.3. Recommendation two  
Safety issue  – The regulatory and operational accountabilities of the Auckland metro system 
do not expressly deal with responsibility for safety and control at the boundar ies between 
station platforms and the rail corrido r. 
7.3.1.  KiwiRail is required to have a rail licence and an approved ‘ Safety Case’ outlining its rail 
activities  under the Railways Act 2005 .  KiwiRail has a safety system that details how it will 
operate safely in accordance with its Safety Case. 
7.3.2.  Auckland Trans port is the owner of the Auckland metro passenger trains  and leases the 
railway stations in the Auckland area from KiwiRail.   Auckland Transport is deemed to be a rail 
participant as defined in section 4 of the Railways Act 2005.  When the Railways A ct became 
law, the predecessor of the NZ Transport Agency advised the predecessor of Auckland 
Transport that it was not a rail operator.  Consequently,  Auckland Transport has neither 
applied for a rail licence nor applied for an exemption . 
7.3.3.  The KiwiRail Saf ety Case and resultant safety system, including the deed of lease and access 
agreements for Morningside Station, do es not expressly deal with who is responsible for 
controlling and protecting pedestrians crossing the boundaries between railway stations and  
the rail corridor.  Consequently , KiwiRail and Auckland Transport h ave been operating on 
differing understandings about their responsibilities in relation to this issue.  
7.3.4.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission recommend ed to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport  
Agency that from a regulatory perspective he take the necessary steps to ensure that the 
relevant Safety Case(s) and resultant safety system(s) (including any lease or access 
agreements made under that system (s)) expressly articulate which party or partie s is 
responsible for controlling and protecting pedestrians as they cross the boundaries between 
railway stations and the rail corridor. (012/15)  
7.3.5.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied : 
While the Transport Agenc y gives the Commission an undertaking to implement 
this recommendation, we must first consider the statutory and regulatory options 
in which to do this.  This will involve engaging with a number of relevant parties in 
a process that will take time.  We wil l advise the Commission of our progress in 
due course.  
  
 
Final report RO -2015 -101 
<< Page 19 >>
 7.4. Recommendation three  
Safety issue  – The level of protection for people using pedestrian level crossings in the 
Auckland metro network is unlikely to be adequate because the risk assessment process for 
pedestrian level  crossings is not keeping pace with the infrastructure changes and increasing 
patronage . 
7.4.1.  There are 52 level crossings in the Auckland metro network that can be used by pedestrians.  
These level crossings are equipped with a mixture of active and passive warning devices.  
Records show that there were 13 other pedestrian accidents wit hin the Auckland metro 
network and five accidents within the Wellington metro network between 1 January 2006 and 
30 January 2015.  
7.4.2.  In recent years the following changes have occurred in the Auckland metro network:  
 most of the rail network has been multi -tracked  
 a bi-directional signalling system has been installed to allow trains to use tracks in either 
direction  
 more new electric multiple unit trains have been introduced  
 the frequency of passenger trains has increased  
 there has been a substantial increase i n train patronage in Auckland (25% for 
Morningside Station) and it is projected to increase further as passenger train services 
are increased.  
7.4.3.  Some of the changes listed above also apply to the Wellington metro network.  
7.4.4.  The NZ Transport Agency and KiwiRail  use A LCAM  to assess the risk factors for road and 
pedestrian  level  crossings in New Zealand.  The default frequency for the assessment is every 
two years.  The model considers 130 variables at all types of level crossing, including the five 
factors referr ed to above.  The most recent assessment report for the Morningside Drive 
pedestrian level crossing was undertaken during December  2014, seven weeks  before th e 
accident.  
7.4.5.  An example of how the changes to the rail infrastructure have potentially compromised 
pedestrian safety is with the design of existing pedestrian mazes that have been constructed 
to force pedestrians to face in the direction of approaching trains before they turn and cross 
the tracks.  With the ability for trains to be routed in either dire ction along bi -directional lines, 
trains could now potentially be approaching from behind pedestrians.  
7.4.6.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission recommend ed that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency liaise with the relevant road control ling authorities in A uckland and Wellington, and 
KiwiRail, to review all pedestrian level  crossings and ensure that they address the safety issue 
whereby they have a level of protection commensurate with the level of risk currently and in 
the immediate future. (013/15)  
7.4.7.  On 14 A ugust 2015 the Chief Executive of t he NZ Transport Agency replied : 
Throughout New Zealand, a wide range of level crossing -related activities and 
work is being undertaken by a variety of rail participants and agencies. This work 
encompasses level  crossing infrastructure, planning, funding, risk review and risk 
mitigation.  
Consequently, the Agency is commencing a stocktake of this work and the parties 
responsible for it to give us a greater knowledge base about the solutions being 
developed and by whom.  When this work is completed and the Transport Agency 
has a comprehensive picture of the scope of activities underway, it will be in a 
clearer position to provide the Commission with information about this 
recommendation.

 Final report RO -2015 -101 7.5. Recommendation four  
Safety issue – A large percentage of pedestrian level crossings located in provincial areas do 
not fully conform with guidelines within  the NZ Transport Agency ’s Traffic Control Devices 
Man ual – Part 9  – Level Crossings  
7.5.1.  There are 605 pedestrian level cross ings on KiwiRail’s provincial network outside the 
Auckland and Wellington metro networks covered in previous sections.  Records show that 
50% of these level crossing are located near schools and 77% of th ese level crossings do not 
conform fully with the NZ  Transport Agency guidelines . 
7.5.2.  On 25 August 2016  the Commission recommend ed to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport 
Agency that he liaise with  KiwiRail and  relevant road control ling authorities to assess and 
confirm which provincial level crossings have significant safety issues that do not align  with 
the NZ Transport Agency’s Traffic Control Devices Man ual – Part 9  – Level Crossings , then 
work with the  authorities to  ensure that safety improvements are prioritised and implemented . 
(018/16)  
7.5.3.  On 8 Sept ember 2016 the National Manger, Rail Safety  of the NZ Transport Agency replied : 
The Transport Agency, in its capacity as rail safety regulator, will formally write to 
the appropriate entities, including KiwiRail and advise them of the 
recommendation 018/16 and request that they advise the Agency of how they 
plan to:  
1. Review the level crossings in their areas to establish if there are safety 
issues that need addressing – in alignment with the NZ Transport Agency’s 
Traffic control devices manual – Part 9 – Level Crossings  
2. Ensure safety improvements are prioritised and implemented.  
We will ensure the Commission is kept informed of the progress made relating to 
this recommendation.

 8. Key l esson  
8.1. The use of  mobile devices by pedestrians  has been found to make them less aware of hazards 
around them .  Rail operators and providers of rail infrastructure must factor this into their risk 
assessments when designing safety into rail infrastructure.
