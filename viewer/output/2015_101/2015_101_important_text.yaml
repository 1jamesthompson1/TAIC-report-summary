  \ discusses what happened in this case, then moves to a discussion of \nthree  broader\
  \ safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 the lack of active warnings protecting pedestrians using\
  \ the Morningside Road \npedestrian  level  crossing when leavi ng Morningside Station\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the lack of clarity over who is responsible for safety and control at\
  \ the boundaries \nbetween station platforms and the rail corridor in Auckland \
  \ \n\uF0B7 the ability of the risk assessment process for pedestrian level crossings\
  \ to keep pace \nwith infrastructure changes and increasing patronage on metro passenger\
  \ trains . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The weather  at the time of the accident\
  \ was fine and clear .  The sun was behind the \npedestrian after he alighted from\
  \ his train , so it was very unlikely to have obscured the train \nfrom the pedestrian\
  \ 's view .  There was no one else walking on the platform ramp at the time \nand\
  \ there were no fixed structures that would have totally obstructed his view of\
  \ the train.  \n4.2.2.  The train had its forward -facing upper and lower headlights\
  \ illuminated.  The lower headlights \nwere known as 'ditch' lights  and were mounted\
  \ low down on each side of the driv ing trailer.  \nThey flash ed alternate ly for\
  \ 20 seconds  whenever the train whistle was sounded  in order to \ndraw atten tion\
  \ to the train's  presence.  These lights were operational and would have been \n\
  flashing for the eight -second  period from when the driver first sounded the train\
  \ whistle  until \nthe time of the accident.   Therefore , a clear view of the train\
  \ headlights  would have been  \navailable to the pedestrian had he been looking\
  \ in that direction . \n4.2.3.  The barrier arms and warning lights and bells for\
  \ the road level crossing were operating at the \ntime.  The lights were directed\
  \ at road users rather than pedestrians walking  down the \nplatform ramp, so these\
  \ would not have been visible to  the pedestrian.  \n4.2.4.  The level crossing\
  \ warning bells would have been audible to peopl e in the vicinity of the \nplatform\
  \ ramp .  The train from which  the pedestrian had just alighted had just depart\
  \ ed the \nplatform at the time he started walking down the platform ramp.  It would\
  \ have been  possible \nfor a person to assume that the road level crossing warning\
  \ devices were for the departing \ntrain and not appreciate that they were also\
  \ for the train coming  from the opposite direction.  \nIt would have been equally\
  \ possible that the noise of the departing train partially masked the \nsound of\
  \ the warning bells.  It was not possible to determine whether these  were  factor\
  \ s in \nthis accident.  \n4.2.5.  The train whistle was first sounded when the\
  \ train was 137 m etres  and the pedestrian about \n10 m etres  from the level crossing.\
  \  The train would then have been visible to the pedestrian.  \n4.2.6.  The train\
  \ driver sounded a second and longer blast on the train  whistle when he saw the\
  \ \npedes trian make a 90-degree  turn and enter the level crossing without hesitation.\
  \  The train \nwas then about 25 m etres  and the pedestrian about 2 .5 metres \
  \ from the accident site.  The \ntrain struck the pedestrian two seconds later.\
  \  \nThe pedestrian was very likely distracted by his mobile phone  \n4.2.7.  It\
  \ is very likely that the train whistle would have been audible to the pedestrian.\
  \  However, t he \npedestrian  was wearing small , bud-type earphones connected\
  \ to a mobile phone  he was \ncarrying at waist  level .  He w as seen to be  using\
  \ his  mobile phone while he walked down the \nplatform  ramp leading to the pedestrian\
  \ level crossing.   It was not possible to establish \nwhether sound was emitting\
  \ from the earphones.  The possibility of sound emitting from his \nearphones masking\
  \ the sound of the level crossing warning devices and the train whistle \ncould\
  \ not be excluded . \n \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report RO -2015 -101 4.2.8.  The\
  \ use of mobile devices  by pedestrians  has been found to make them less aware\
  \ of hazards \naround them. A research paper written by Marc Green (Green, M (2004)\
  \ ), Inattentional \nBlindness and Conspicuity , found that \"mobile -phone -using\
  \ pedestrians were less likely to \nnotice other obj ects in their environment ;\
  \ they were also less likely to look for traffic  before \nstarting to cross a road\
  \  or street \".  This finding can equally be applied to pedestrian s crossing \
  \ \na railway  track  and is very likely to have been a factor in the present case\
  \ . \nUse of performance -impairing drugs  \n4.2.9.  The driver undertook a drug\
  \ and alcohol screening test  following the accident , which returned \na positive\
  \ result for cannabinoids.   The Commission could not determine whether drug \n\
  impairment was a factor contributing to this accident.  However, event recorders\
  \ showed that \nthe train was being driven at below the maximum line speed and the\
  \ driver used the train \nwhistle appropriately to warn pedestrians  that the train\
  \ was approaching .  The driver could not \nhave done anything  further to prevent\
  \ the accident.  \n4.2.10.  Nevertheless, the use of performance -impairing drugs\
  \ by a driver of a passenger train is a \nserious safety issue.   Both Transdev\
  \ and the NZ Transport Agency have taken action to \naddress this issue (refer to\
  \ Section 6 , Safety actions ).  The Commission has issued two \nrecommendations\
  \  (007/133 dated April 2013 and 012/134 dated October 2013) regarding \nthe use\
  \ of performance -impairing drugs by anyone who has a safety -critical role in the\
  \ \naviation, rail or maritime transport  industr y.  The positive test for cannabis\
  \ for this train driver \nfurther highlights the need for the rail industry to address\
  \ this safety issue.  \nFindings  \n1. It is very likely that the pedestrian was\
  \ distracted while using  his mobile phone \nwhen he stepped out in front of the\
  \ train.  \n2. The train was being driven at an appropriate speed and the driver\
  \ did all he \ncould in the time available to warn the pedestrian  that the train\
  \ was \napproaching . \n4.3. Morningside Drive pedestrian level crossing  \nSafety\
  \ issue  - There were no active visual alarms or physical barriers to prevent pedestrians\
  \ \nexiting the Morningside Station platform and inadvertently entering the Morningside\
  \ Drive \npedestrian level crossing when trains approach ed. \n4.3.1.  Morning side\
  \ Station was one of 20 stations in  Auckland where the train tracks ran either\
  \ side \nof an island platform.  \n4.3.2.  Auckland Transport figures showed that\
  \ passenger numbers through Morningside Station had \nincreased by about 25% between\
  \ 2013 and 2015 , but the station was ranked only 35th on its \nlist of 41 stations\
  \ in terms of overall passenger numbers during 2015.  \n4.3.3.  Subways that enable\
  \ pedestrians to walk under , and bridges that enable pedestrians to walk \nover\
  \ the tracks provide a good  safeguard to segre gate pedestrians from trains.  \
  \ There was o ne \nsubway at Morningside Station , located  at the western end of\
  \ the station ( refer  Figure 2).  \n  \n                                      \
  \                  \n3 Recomm endation 007/13 contained in Rail Occurrence Report\
  \ RO -2011 -103, track workers nearly struck \nby passenger train near Paekakariki,\
  \ 25 August 2011.  \n4 Recommendation 012/13 contained in Aviation Occurrence Report\
  \ AO -2012 -001, hot -air balloon collision \nwith po wer lines and in -flight fire,\
  \ near Carterton, 7 January 2012.  \n \nFinal report RO -2015 -101 \n<< Page 9 >>\n\
  \ 4.3.4.  Auckland Transport figures showed that 20% of its passengers at Morningside\
  \  Station  used \nthe subway between January an d April 2015.   The other 80% of\
  \ the passengers at \nMorningside station used the platform ramp at the east ern\
  \ end of the station , which was \nwhere this accident occurred . \n4.3.5.  As previously\
  \ mentioned , the use of mobile phones and other devices while on the move is \n\
  commonplace.  It is very likely that the pedestrian looking at, and possibly listening\
  \ to, his \nmobile phone was a factor contributing to the accident.   Transport\
  \ operators need to factor  in \nthis risk when considering the protection of the\
  \ travelling public.  \n4.3.6.  In this case t he only visual cue installed on the\
  \ platform ramp to warn pedestrians was the \nyellow sign warning them  to 'look\
  \ for trains' as provided for in the NZ Transport Agency's \nTraffic  Control Devices\
  \ Manual  - Part 9  - Level Crossings  (see Figure 4).  There were no active \n\
  visual warning lights or barriers installed on the platform ramp  to prevent people\
  \ inadvertently \nstepping out in front of a train . \n \nFigure 4  \nNZ Transport\
  \ Agency 's 'look for trains' sign \n4.3.7.  KiwiRail's records show ed that there\
  \ had been no accidents between trains and motor \nvehicles at the Morningside Drive\
  \ road level crossing since 1965, the year th e barriers were \ninstalled.  Therefore\
  \ , the activation of the barrier arms, together with the illuminated flashing \n\
  lights and audible alarms , had been an effective safeguard in preventing motor\
  \ vehicles \nentering the level crossing . \n4.3.8.  In contrast , there had been\
  \ one pedestrian fatality (in 2002 ) and se veral reported near misses  \nsince\
  \ pedestrian mazes were installed  in 1986 .  All of the pedestrian accidents/incidents\
  \  \noccurred at the same pedestrian level crossing where this accident occurred\
  \ and all involved \nWait\u0101kere -bound trains travelling on the northbound track\
  \ . \n4.3.9.  On 30 July 2015 the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport \nAgency  that he liaise with Auckland Transport to install\
  \ some  form of active warning device or \nbarrier at the Morningside Drive pe destrian\
  \ level  crossin g. \n4.3.10.  On 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport\
  \ Agency replied in part as follows:  \nKiwiRail and Auckland Transport are working\
  \ on a solution to address the \nidentified safety issues at the pedestrian level\
  \ crossings at Morningside Station \nin We st Auckland. The Transport Agency is\
  \ actively monitoring this situation to \nensure the resolution is implemented in\
  \ an effective and timely manner.  \n4.3.11.  On 27 July 2016 the Chief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport Agency provided an update on \nprogress.  Refer to Section\
  \ 7, Recommendations, for the full response.  \nFindings  \n3. The active barriers,\
  \ lights and audible alarms for the Morningside Road level \ncrossing were operating\
  \ correctly.  \n4. There was insufficient protection at the Morningside Station\
  \ p latform  ramp to \npreven t pedestrians inadvertently entering the rail corridor\
  \ in front of \napproaching trains.  \n\n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report RO -2015\
  \ -101 4.4. Responsibility for protecting pedestrians  \nSafety issue - The regulatory\
  \ and operational accountabilities of the Auckland metro system \ndo not expressly\
  \ deal with responsibility for safety and control at the boundar ies between \n\
  station platforms and the rail corridor.  \n4.4.1.  During this inquiry it became\
  \ apparent  that there was uncertainty about  what entity  was \nresponsib le for\
  \ protecting pedestrians at the boundar ies between station platforms and the \n\
  rail corridor.  \n4.4.2.  KiwiRail is required to have a rail licence and an approved\
  \ ' Safety Case5' outlining its rail \nactivities  under the Railways Act 2005 .\
  \  KiwiRail has a resultant safety system that details \nhow it will operate safely\
  \ in accordance with its Safety Case. \n4.4.3.  KiwiRail considered that it owned\
  \ and controlled all pedestrian level crossings in New Zealand, \nincluding those\
  \ on the Auckland and Wellington metro networks  in its Safety Case dated 1 \nAugust\
  \ 2013 .  Pedestrian lev el crossing boundaries were recorded .  However, t he Safety\
  \ Case \ndid not consider who controlled the movement of pedestrians across the\
  \ boundaries.  \n4.4.4.  KiwiRail's safety system6 was not explicit on who was responsible\
  \ for, and who controlled , the \nboundaries between the rail corridor and adjacent\
  \ land owners, which in the case of \nMorningside Drive was Auckland Transport.\
  \  KiwiRail explained i n a submission dated 17 June \n2015 that it considered Auckland\
  \ Transport to be  responsible for controllin g safety at the \nboundary of the\
  \ two open entrances at the Morningside Drive Up pedestrian level crossing.   \n\
  Auckland Transport did not agree.  \n4.4.5.  Auckland Transport is the owner of\
  \ the Auckland metro passenger trains and also lease s the \nrailway stations in\
  \ the Auckland metro network  from KiwiRail.  Auckland Transport is deemed \nto\
  \ be a rail participant as defined in section 4 of the Railways Act 2005.  When\
  \ th at Act \nbecame law, the predecessor of the NZ Transport Agency7 advised the\
  \ predecessor of \nAuckland Transp ort8 that it was not a rail operator . \n4.4.6.\
  \  Consequently,  Auckland Transport has neither applied for a rail licence nor\
  \ applied for an \nexemption.  Safety issues pertaining to the Auckland metro passenger\
  \ services are managed \nthrough the licences and approved Safety Cases of Transdev\
  \ Auckland Limited , which \noperate s the trains , and Construccioes y Auxilar\
  \ de Ferrocarriles , which built and currently \nmaintain s the electric trains.\
  \  \n4.4.7.  Auckland Transport and KiwiRail  had different understandings about\
  \ their respective \nresponsibilities and obligations in relation to safety controls\
  \ at pedestrian level crossing \nboundaries.  Consequently , the parties were  operating\
  \ on differing understandings about their \nresponsibilities in relation to this\
  \ issue.  \n4.4.8.  The Commission considers th ere were  differences between KiwiRail's\
  \ Safety Case and the \nlease agreements that gave rise to uncertainty.  In particular,\
  \ the lease agreements gave a \nbroad overview of which stakeholder held safety\
  \ responsibilities for the Morningside Drive \nlevel crossings, but did not expressly\
  \ articulate which party (or parties) was responsible for \ncontrolling and protecting\
  \ pedestrians as they cross ed the boundaries between railway \nstations and the\
  \ rail corridor.  \n  \n                                                       \

  \ to control access to and operate \ntrains on the rail network.  \n6 The underlying\
  \ array of written policies, rules, proce sses, procedures and task instructions\

  Final report RO -2015 -101 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.4.9.  Therefore, on 30 July 2015,\
  \ the Commission reco mmended  to the Chief Executive of the NZ \nTransport Agency\
  \ that he take the necessary steps to remove any uncertainty.  \n4.4.10.  On 14\
  \ August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied as follows:\
  \  \nWhile the Transport Agency gives the Commission an un dertaking to implement\
  \ \nthis recommendation, we must first consider the statutory and regulatory options\
  \ \nin which to do this.  This will involve engaging with a number of relevant parties\
  \ in \na process that will take time.  We will advise the Commission of o ur progress\
  \ in \ndue course.  \n4.5. Risk assessments for pedestrian level crossings  \nSafety\
  \ issue  - The level of protection for people using pedestrian level crossings in\
  \ the \nAuckland metro network is currently  inadequate  because the risk assessment\
  \ process for \npedestrian level  crossings is not keeping pace with the infrastructure\
  \ changes and increasing \npatronage.  \n4.5.1.  There are 52 level crossings in\
  \ the Auckland metro network that can be used by pedestrians.  \nThese  level  cross\
  \ ings are equipped with a mixture of active and passive warning devices.  \nRecords\
  \ show ed that there were 13 other pedestrian accidents within the Auckland metro\
  \ \nnetwork and five accidents within the Wellington metro network between 1 January\
  \ 2006 and \n30 Jan uary 2015.  \n4.5.2.  In 2007 KiwiRail and the NZ Transport\
  \ Agency had adopted a computer -based application to \nassess and rank risk levels\
  \ at road and pedestrian level crossings , known as the Australian \nLevel Crossing\
  \ Assessment Model (ALCAM) .  KiwiRail and road controlling authorities use \nALCAM\
  \  to prioritise upgrade work  at level crossings . \n4.5.3.  To make an assessment\
  \ of a pedestrian level crossing, data is gathered relating to the \nnumber of trains\
  \ that travel over the crossing , the number of pedestrians who use the  \ncrossi\
  \ ng, and the level of protection provided at the crossing.  Substantial changes\
  \ in other \ndata used to make the assessment  will warrant a new risk assessment\
  \ being undertaken  for \nthat level crossing.  \n4.5.4.  Record s also show ed\
  \ that monthly passenger numbers on the Auckland network increased \nfrom 300,000\
  \  in July 2005 to 1 .5 million i n March 2015 .  These figures compare closely\
  \ with \nAuckland Transport 's forecast  increase made in the early 2000s.  Auckland\
  \ Transport and \nKiwiRail ha d undertaken the following upgr ades to the metro\
  \ network  in recent years  in \npreparation for the  planned increase in passenger\
  \ numbers : \n\uF0B7 most of the network had been  multi -tracked  \n\uF0B7 new\
  \ lines to Onehunga and Manukau had been  constructed  \n\uF0B7 a new bi-directional\
  \ signalling system had been commissioned that allow ed trains to use  \neither\
  \ line in multi -tracked areas  at normal speed  \n\uF0B7 new electric multiple\
  \ unit passenger trains  had been introduced after the installation of a \nnew electric\
  \ overhead system  \n\uF0B7 the North Auckland Line  peak-hour passenger train frequency\
  \  had been increased  to four \ntrains per hour  in each direction  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ maximum train speeds had been increased by between 10 km/h  and 30 km/h.  \n4.5.5.\
  \  On 9 May 2016 Auckland Transport  further increase d the passenger train frequency\
  \ on the \nNorth Auckland Line from four  to six trains per hour in each direction\
  \ during the morning and  \nafternoon peak -hour operations , and from two to three\
  \ trains per hour during the inter -peak \nperiods .  The total number of trains\
  \ per week day on the line rose from  101 to 138 Monday to \nThursday , and to 145\
  \ on Friday s. \n  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2015 -101 4.5.6.  Using\
  \ the Morningside Drive level crossing as an example, the first ALCAM assessment\
  \ was \nundertaken during May 2007.  The site assessment was not repeated until\
  \  December 2014, \nseven weeks  before the accident.  During  those seven and a\
  \ half  years'  significant changes \noccurr ed in the Auckland metro system  that\
  \ resulted in changes to the parameters that were \nused in making the first risk\
  \ assessment.  During that same period the ALCAM database  was \nonly updated for\
  \ the number of trains per day travelling over the level crossing, which was only\
  \ \none of many parameters that were changing.  The ALCAM risk process was not keeping\
  \ pace \nwith the changes affecting safety at the Morningside Drive level c rossing.\
  \  \n4.5.7.  An ALCAM  National Statistical Report , jointly published by KiwiRail\
  \ and the NZ Transport \nAgency in March 2013 , stated that the pedestrian accident\
  \ risk was about 10 times higher in \nthe Auckland and Wellington regions than in\
  \  the rest of the country.  The report concluded  that \nthe increased risk was\
  \ due to metro systems operating in both cities.  \n4.5.8.  Auckland Transport's\
  \ d raft Regional Land Transport Plan 2015 -2025 recognised that rail \ninfrastructure\
  \ investment was needed to addres s safety issues at level crossings .  However,\
  \  \nthe report did not elaborate on the nature of those safety issues and how they\
  \ would be \naddressed.  \n4.5.9.  An example of how the changes to the rail infrastructure\
  \ have potentially compromised \npedestrian safety is the design of existing pedestrian\
  \ mazes .  The NZ Transport Agency's \nTraffic Control Devices Manual - Part 9 \
  \ - Level Crossings  states that mazes  have been \nconstructed to force pedestrians\
  \ to face in the direction of approaching trains before they turn \nand cross the\
  \ tracks.  With the ability for trains in the Auckland metro area to be routed in\
  \ \neither direction along bi -directional lines, trains co uld now potentially\
  \ be approaching from \nbehind pedestrians.  \n4.5.10.  The speed of change within\
  \ the Auckland metro  system means it is very likely  that the current \nfrequency\
  \ of and output from  ALCAM risk assessments will not meet the safety requirements\
  \ \nat pedestria n level crossings .  Although the rate of change in Wellington\
  \ is slower, similar \nissues are  very likely to arise there also.  \n4.5.11. \
  \ On 30 July 2015 the Commission issued an urgent recommendation to the Chief Executive\
  \ of \nthe NZ Transport Agency that he address th is safety issue . \n4.5.12.  On\
  \ 14 August 2015 the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied in part\
  \ as follows:  \nThroughout New Zealand, a wide range of level crossing -related\
  \ activities and \nwork is being undertaken by a variety of rail participants and\
  \ agenc ies. This work \nencompasses level crossing infrastructure, planning, funding,\
  \ risk review and risk \nmitigation.  \n4.6. Other pedestrian level crossing s \n\
  Safety issue - A large percentage of pedestrian level crossing s located in provincial\
  \ areas do \nnot fully conform with guidelines within  the NZ Transport Agency 's\
  \ Traffic  Control Devices \nManual - Part 9 - Level Crossings . \n4.6.1.  Three\
  \ further level crossing  accidents , involving two pedestrians and a cyclist ,\
  \ occurred in \nother  regions during the period  of this investigation : \n\uF0B7\
  \ on 6 August 2015  a pedestrian was fatally injured after being struck by a Papakura\
  \ -bound \nTransdev passenger train at Walters Road pedestrian level crossing  in\
  \ South Auckland  \n\uF0B7 on 11 January 2016  a pedestrian was fatally injured\
  \ after being struck by a KiwiRa il \nfreight locomotive at Weymouth Street pedestrian\
  \ level crossing in New Plymouth  \n\uF0B7 on 11 February 2016 a cyclist was fatally\
  \ injured after being struck b y a KiwiRail freight \ntrain at Fendalton Road  pedestrian\
  \ level crossing in Christchurch.  \n  \n \nFinal report RO -2015 -101 \n<< Page\
  \ 13 >>\n 4.6.2.  The ALCAM Nat ional Statistical Report , published during March\
  \ 2013,  showed that in New \nZealand there was an annual average of eight  fatal\
  \ /serious injuries to motor vehicle \noccupants involved in level crossing accidents\
  \ .  During the same period covered in the report \nthere was an annual average\
  \ of three  fatal/serious injuries to pedestrians involved in level \ncrossing accidents.\
  \  \n4.6.3.  The r eport also stated that of 605 pedestrian level crossing s on\
  \ KiwiRail's provincial network , \n50% were located near schools  and 77% did not\
  \ conform  fully with the NZ Transport Agency 's \nTraffic Control Devices Manual\
  \ - Part 9  - Level Crossings .  The manual contains a suite of \nguidelines within\
  \ the traffic control devices manual prepared by the NZ Transport Agency and \n\
  used by rail providers and road controlling authorities that have road and pedestrian\
  \ level \ncrossings within their jurisdictions . \n4.6.4.  However, t he NZ Transport\
  \ Agency advised  that currently minor non -conformance s, for \nexample  a narrow\
  \ line marking , can trigger the 'non -compliance flag' within the survey process\
  \ \nand the ALCAM reports do not  explain or itemise what the specific non -compliance\
  \ s might be.  \nConsequently, the nature of the non -conformances, as indicated\
  \ in the 2013 ALCAM Level \nCrossing Sta tistical Report , are not fully understood\
  \ . \n4.6.5.  Therefore , the Commission is recommend ing to the Chief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport \nAgency  that he liaise with KiwiRail and relevant road control\
  \ ling authorities to assess and \nconfirm which provincial level crossings have\
  \ significant safety issues that  do not align with  \nthe NZ Transport Agency's\
  \ Traffic Control Devices  Manual - Part 9  - Level Crossings , then \nwork with\
  \ the  authorities to  ensure safety improvements are prioritised and implemented\
  \ . \nFinding s \n5. Uncertainty existed over which entity was responsible for controlling\
  \ pedestrian \nmovements between station platforms and the rail corridor in the\
  \ Auckland \nmetro network . \n6. The process for assessing risk s at pede strian\
  \ level crossings  around the \nAuckland , and to a lesser extent  the Wellington\
  \ , rail corridors has not kept up \nwith the pace of change in these rail systems.\
  \  \n7. Seventy -seven  percent of pedestrian level crossings in KiwiRail's provincial\
  \  \nnetwork did  not conform fully  with the NZ Transport Agency 's Traffic Control\
  \ \nDevices Manual - Part 9  - Level Crossing s.  However, the extent of  the non\
  \ -\nconformances has not been fully analysed . \n \n \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>"
