- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The pilot was likely well-rested on the morning of the accident, as suggested by "flight and duty records and interviews with the pilot's family, the loader driver and the farmer" (3.4). Therefore, fatigue management did not contribute to the accident.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence in the document that human error or assumptions played a role in the accident. The analysis did not identify any such factors as contributing to the event (3.2-3.25).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The pilot had undergone a competency check six months prior to the accident and was very experienced in agricultural operations and the Cresco type of aeroplane (3.15). Training and competency were not considered causal factors in this accident (3.17).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not provide information suggesting that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment contributed to the accident. The pilot was experienced with the type of aircraft involved (3.15).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in the accident, as there is no mention of crew interactions or resource management issues in the document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not indicate that a failure to adhere to safety procedures contributed to the accident. No safety procedures or protocols were identified as being breached (3.2-3.25).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 0
  explanation: An examination of the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals did not identify any historical or systemic issues that may have been relevant to or causal factors in this accident (3.19).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not provide information suggesting that risk management and analysis were factors in the accident. No issues with risk assessments or safety plans were mentioned (3.2-3.25).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of regulatory oversight and compliance issues contributing to the accident in the document (3.2-3.25).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not explicitly state that situational awareness was a factor in the accident. However, the lack of corrective action by the pilot could suggest a loss of situational awareness, but this is not confirmed (3.21-3.22).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Emergency response preparedness is not discussed as a contributing factor in the accident within the document (3.2-3.25).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There was no evidence to indicate a failure of the aircraft system, such as a failure of flight controls or steering, during the take-off roll (3.10). Maintenance and inspection regimes were not identified as contributing to the accident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not discuss the use of automation as a contributing factor to the accident (3.2-3.25).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Weather conditions were not identified as a contributing factor to the accident. The document mentions flat light conditions but rules out sunstrike as a factor (3.6).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of communication breakdown contributing to the accident in the document (3.2-3.25).
- name: Other
  percentage: 100
  explanation: The document concludes that it was "about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25, 4.4). Since none of the predefined safety themes directly address pilot incapacitation and this was the only factor mentioned as a possible cause, "Other" is defined as "Pilot Incapacitation" and is assigned the full weighting.
