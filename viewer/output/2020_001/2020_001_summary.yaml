- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The investigation found that "it was likely the pilot was well rested on the morning of the accident" and there was no indication of any concerns regarding the pilot's health or wellbeing (3.4). Therefore, fatigue and alertness did not contribute to the accident.
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of communication issues or crew resource management problems in the document. The pilot was operating the aircraft alone, and no communication breakdowns were reported (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The pilot had undergone a competency check six months prior to the accident and was very experienced in agricultural operations and the Cresco type of aeroplane (3.15). Training and competency were not considered causal factors in this accident (3.17).
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There was no evidence to indicate a failure of the aircraft system, such as a failure of flight controls or steering, during the take-off roll (3.10). Maintenance procedures and compliance were not identified as contributing to the accident.
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not provide information on fire detection and suppression systems as a contributing factor to the accident. An intense fire followed the impact, but there is no indication that these systems were a factor in the accident's occurrence (3.1).
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: An examination of the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals did not identify any historical or systemic issues that may have been relevant to or causal factors in this accident (3.19).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The Commission found no evidence that the pilot's situational awareness had been compromised by external factors during the take-off roll (3.8). Therefore, situational awareness was not a contributing factor.
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of equipment design and specifications being a factor in the accident. The investigation did not identify any issues with the design or specifications of the aeroplane that contributed to the accident (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not discuss risk assessment and management as a contributing factor to the accident. There is no evidence suggesting that inadequate risk assessment or management practices contributed to the event (Insufficient information).

- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The Commission found no evidence that the pilot had become distracted or that their situational awareness had been compromised by external factors during the take-off roll (3.8). Distracted operation was not a contributing factor.
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The undercarriage was dislodged in a single high-impact event during the accident sequence and had been a result of the accident and not a causal factor (3.11). Structural integrity and material fatigue were not identified as contributing factors.
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There was no evidence that the pilot attempted to take remedial action at any stage during the take-off sequence, which suggests that human error in the form of a correctable mistake was not a contributing factor (3.24).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The examination of the operator's Safety Management System and other documentation did not identify any historical or systemic issues that may have been relevant to or causal factors in this accident (3.19).
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 0

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 100
  explanation: The investigation concluded that "it was about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25). Since the investigation's findings suggest pilot incapacitation as the most likely cause, and this is not covered by the predefined safety themes, it is assigned as "Other" with a 100% weighting.
