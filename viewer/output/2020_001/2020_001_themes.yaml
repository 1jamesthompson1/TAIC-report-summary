- name: Pilot Incapacitation
  explanation: Pilot incapacitation refers to a situation where a pilot is unable to perform their duties due to a medical or other condition. This theme is relevant to the accident because the investigation found it "about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25). The lack of any corrective action by the pilot, such as discontinuing the take-off or correcting the take-off path, suggests that the pilot may have been incapacitated and therefore unable to perform such actions (3.21, 3.22). The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of the pilot attempting to take remedial action during the take-off sequence, which would be expected from a well-trained and experienced agricultural pilot (3.24).
- name: Mechanical Failure
  explanation: Mechanical failure encompasses any malfunction or breakdown of aircraft components that can lead to an accident. In this case, the theme is relevant because the investigation considered the possibility of mechanical failure as a causal factor. However, it was determined that the engine was "delivering full power during the take-off roll and at the time of impact" (3.9), and there was no evidence of a failure in the aircraft's systems, such as flight controls or steering (3.10). The undercarriage was dislodged due to a high-impact event during the accident sequence, not as a causal factor (3.11). Thus, mechanical failure was not deemed a contributing factor in this accident, but it was a critical area of investigation.
- name: Airstrip Suitability
  explanation: Airstrip suitability refers to the appropriateness of an airstrip for the operations being conducted, including its condition and any potential hazards. This theme is relevant because the investigation assessed the airstrip's condition. Witness evidence indicated that the airstrip was suitable for agricultural operations on the day of the accident, and the pilot had not expressed any concerns about the airstrip during the previous flights that day (3.18). The airstrip's suitability was confirmed by another agricultural pilot who considered it a typical farm airstrip with no unusual hazards or challenges (3.18).
- name: Pilot Training and Competency
  explanation: Pilot training and competency are critical for ensuring that pilots can handle the aircraft and any situations that may arise during flight. This theme is relevant because the pilot in the accident was experienced in agricultural operations and the specific type of aircraft involved (3.15). The pilot had also demonstrated the ability to jettison loads when necessary and had done so in the past (3.16). The investigation found that training and competency were not considered causal factors in this accident (3.17), indicating that the pilot's training and experience were sufficient for the operations being conducted.
- name: Overload
  explanation: Overload in aviation can refer to the aircraft being over its weight capacity, which can affect its performance and handling. This theme is relevant because the investigation verified the load carried by the aircraft and confirmed that the load on the accident flight was the same as in the previous two flights, and the aircraft would have been lighter on the third take-off due to fuel consumption (3.13). A weight-and-balance calculation confirmed that the aircraft was within flight manual limits (3.14), indicating that overload was not a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Organisational Influences
  explanation: Organisational influences include the policies, procedures, and culture within an aviation organization that can impact safety. This theme is relevant because the investigation examined the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals for any historical or systemic issues that could have been relevant to or causal factors in this accident (3.19). No such issues were identified, suggesting that the organisational influences did not contribute to the accident. However, this theme is important as it addresses the broader context in which the accident occurred.
