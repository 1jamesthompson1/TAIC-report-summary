- name: Pilot Incapacitation
  explanation: Pilot incapacitation refers to a situation where a pilot is unable to perform their duties due to a medical or other physical condition. This theme is relevant to the accident because the investigation found it "about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25). The lack of any corrective action by the pilot, such as discontinuing the take-off or correcting the take-off path, suggests that the pilot may have been incapacitated and therefore unable to perform such actions (3.21, 3.22). The absence of evidence of any corrective action supports the possibility of incapacitation (3.24).
- name: Mechanical Failure
  explanation: Mechanical failure encompasses any malfunction or breakdown of aircraft components that can lead to an accident. In this case, mechanical failure was considered but ultimately ruled out as a causal factor. The investigation found no evidence of a failure in the aircraft's powerplant, as the engine was "delivering full power during the take-off roll and at the time of impact" (3.9). Similarly, there was no indication of a failure in the airframe systems, such as flight controls or steering, during the take-off roll (3.10). The undercarriage was dislodged due to a high-impact event during the accident sequence, not as a cause of the accident (3.11).
- name: Airstrip Suitability
  explanation: Airstrip suitability refers to the condition and appropriateness of the airstrip for the intended operation. This theme is relevant because the airstrip's condition was assessed as part of the investigation. Witness evidence indicated that the airstrip was suitable for agricultural operations on the day of the accident, and the pilot had not expressed any concerns about the airstrip condition during the previous flights that day (3.18). Another pilot also commented that the airstrip posed no unusual hazards or challenges (3.18).
- name: Pilot Training and Competency
  explanation: Pilot training and competency are critical factors in ensuring that pilots can handle the aircraft and respond to emergencies appropriately. In this accident, the pilot's training and competency were examined and found not to be causal factors. The pilot had undergone a competency check six months prior to the accident and was very experienced in agricultural operations and the specific type of aircraft involved in the accident (3.15). Additionally, there was evidence that the pilot had previously shown no reluctance in jettisoning loads when required, indicating their competency in handling emergency procedures (3.16).
- name: Organizational Influences
  explanation: Organizational influences include the policies, procedures, and safety culture of the operating entity. The investigation looked into the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals but did not identify any historical or systemic issues that could have been relevant or causal factors in this accident (3.19). This suggests that organizational influences were not a contributing factor to the accident, but their examination is a standard part of accident investigations to ensure comprehensive analysis.
- name: Substance Use
  explanation: Substance use by pilots can impair their ability to operate an aircraft safely. In this accident, toxicology examinations were conducted post-mortem, and apart from caffeine, no other drugs were detected in the pilot's blood (3.20). This indicates that substance use was not a factor in the accident, but it is a safety theme that is typically investigated to rule out impairment as a cause of aviation accidents.
