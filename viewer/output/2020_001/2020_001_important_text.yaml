  \ pilot was conducting a routine agricultural spreading operation when t he \naeroplane\
  \  did not follow the required take -off path that had previously been taken , \n\
  and hit uneven terrain, impacting the valley floor. An intense fire followed, destroying\
  \ \nmuch of the evidence  that would otherwise have been available to the investigation\
  \ . \nBecause of the lack of evidence, the reason for the aeroplane deviating from\
  \ the \nnormal flight path could not be determined  conclusively . \n3.2. The following\
  \ section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event to identify \nthose factors\
  \ that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the \nseverity\
  \ of its outcome.  \nAvenues of inquiry  \n3.3. The Transport Accident Investigation\
  \ Commiss ion (Commission ) considered the \navailable evidence , and i n the analysis\
  \ the following were considered for their \nlikelihood as causal factors in this\
  \ accident . \nFatigue  \n3.4. Flight and duty records and i nterviews with the\
  \ pilot's  family , the loader driver and the \nfarmer suggest it was likely the\
  \ pilot was well rested  on the morning of the accident . \nThe witnesses reported\
  \ that t he pilot's  demeanour prior to the accident had not \nindicate d any cause\
  \ for concern regarding their health or wellbeing , including stress \nlevels and\
  \ general fitness to fly . \nDistraction  \n3.5. There is no evidence to indicate\
  \ the pilot was distracted during the take -off roll. It is \nlikely  that in the\
  \ event of a distraction sufficient to cause a deviation from the previous \nideal\
  \ take-off path , there would have been some evidence of the pilot's attempt to\
  \ \ncorrect the deviation and return to the optimum take -off path . The pilot was\
  \ by all \naccounts competent  and experienced and should have been able to manage\
  \ most \ndistractions , for example an unanticipated radio call or a cockpit light,\
  \  easily .  \n3.6. Sunstrike . The early time of day12, combined with  high ground\
  \ to the east of the airstrip  \nand the high overcast cloud , resulted in flat\
  \ light conditions at the time of the a ccident \n(see Figure 8). This made  it\
  \ exceptionally unlikely  that the pilot suffered sunstrike \nduring the accident\
  \ sequence  - noting that this was their third take -off in 10 minutes \nand there\
  \ had been no previous problems reported or observed.  \n \n \n12 https://www.sunrise\

  \ did not report any visual obstructions, for example \nbirds or smoke in the cockpit,\
  \ being present at the time of the accident. If the pilot had  \nhad a visual obstruction\
  \ during the tak e-off roll, some evidence of it would have been \nexpected , such\
  \ as  actions being taken to remedy the situation  or evidence of avian \ndebris\
  \ .  \n3.8. The Commission found no evidence that the pilot had become distracted\
  \  or that their \nsituational awareness had been compromised  by external factors\
  \ during the take -off \nroll. \nMechanical failure  \n3.9. Powerplant.  Witness\
  \ reports and wreckage  evidence show that is was very likely  the \nengine had\
  \ been  delivering full power during the take-off roll and at the time of \nimpact.\
  \   \n3.10. Airframe . There was no evidence to indicate a failure of the aircraft\
  \  system, such as  a \nfailure of  flight controls or steering , during the take\
  \ -off roll.  Damage to the right -hand  \nwing and flap after the undercarriage\
  \ had been dislodged was considered highly \nlikely  to have been a consequence\
  \ of the accident sequence, rather than a causal \nfactor.   \n3.11. Undercarriage\
  \ . An expert analysis of the undercarriage attachment points showed that \nthe\
  \ undercarriage had been dislodged in a single high-impact event  during the \n\
  accident sequence and had been a result of the accident and not a causal factor.\
  \ \nAccording to pilots experienced on this aircraft type , the subsequent damage\
  \ to the \ncontrol surfaces on the right -hand wing, and the dissymmetry of lift\
  \ that resulted , \nwould have made the aeroplane uncontrollable from that point\
  \ onwards.  \n\n \nFinal Report AO -2020 -001 \n<< Page 12 >>\n Overload  \n3.12.\
  \ The Commission conducted  an independent verification of the accuracy of the load\
  \ cell \ninstalled on the loader truck.13 \n3.13. The load records showed that the\
  \ load of product  on the accident flight , at 1 ,700 \nkilograms,  was the same\
  \ as in the previous two flights.  The aeroplane  would have \ntherefore been lighter\
  \ on the third take -off due to fuel consumption .  \n3.14. A weight -and-balance\
  \ calculation based on the recorded load for the flight confirmed \nthe aeroplane\
  \  had been within flight manual limits . \nPilot training and competency  \n3.15.\
  \ The pilot had most recently undergone  a competency check in October 2019  (six\
  \ \nmonths prior to the accident). The pilot was very experienced in agricultural\
  \ operations \nand the Cresco type of aeroplane.   \n3.16. The loader driver and\
  \ other company pilots  stated that the pilot  had previously  show n \nno reluctan\
  \ ce in jettison ing loads if conditions required , and had done so on at least\
  \ \none occasion . It was normal practice for a pilot to move their left hand to\
  \ the \naeroplanes' jettison handle once  full power had been selected for take\
  \ -off. \n3.17. Training and competency were therefore not considered causal factors\
  \ in this accident.  \nAirstrip suitability  \n3.18. Witness evidence was that \
  \ the airstrip  was suitable for agricultural operations on the \nday. This acciden\
  \ t happened on the third flight of the day, and the pilot had not \nexpress ed\
  \ any concern s to the loader driver or the farmer regarding the condition of \n\
  the airstrip on the previous two flights.  Another agricultural pilot who was working\
  \ \nlocally at the time of the accident, and  who landed shortly after the accident\
  \  to render \nassistance if required, commented that , in their view, the airstrip\
  \ was a ty pical farm \nairstrip and posed no unusual hazards or challenges.   \n\
  Organisat ional influences  \n3.19. An examination of the operator 's Safety Management\
  \ System , incident register, \nexposition  and manuals, which contained its policies\
  \  and procedures , did not identify \nany historical or systemic issues that may\
  \ have been relevant to or causal  factor s in this \naccident.  \nSubstance use\
  \ \n3.20. Apart from caffeine, no other drugs were detected in the pilot 's blood\
  \ during the \ntoxicology examination conducted  post-mortem.  \nPilot incapacitation\
  \  \n3.21. The absence of any corrective action by the pilot, including discontinuing\
  \ the take -off, \ncorrecting the take -off path  after encountering rough ground\
  \ , dumping the load  \nand/or making a radio call to the loader driver, could \
  \ have  indicate d that  the pilot was \nincapacitat ed and therefor e was incapable\
  \ of performing such actions.  \n \n13 The fertiliser product was examined and determined\
  \ to b e free flowing , enabling an emergency jettisoning of \nthe load should this\
  \ be demanded.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2020 -001 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 3.22. The lack\
  \ of evidence of any corrective action, either singularly or in combination, \n\
  suggests it is about as likely as not  that the pilot was not able to take such\
  \ actions. \nSuch action s might have include d a course correction, braking, emergency\
  \ jettisoning \nof the load and/or a radio call.  \n3.23. The Civil Aviation Authority\
  \ of New Zealand has published Medical Information Sheet \n012 - Medical Incapacitation\
  \ on the range of conditions that can be classed as  medical \nincapacitation (Civil\
  \ Aviaton Authority of New Zealand, 2010) . See Appendix 1 . \nConclusion  \n3.24.\
  \ There was no evidence that the pilot attempted to take remedial action at any\
  \ stage \nduring the take -off sequence . A well trained and experienced agricultural\
  \ pilot would \nbe expecte d to recognise and take corrective action if the ir take-off\
  \ path w as to differ \nsignificantly from their previous  take-off paths.  \n3.25.\
  \ After an  analysis of the available evidence and after dismissing th ose potential\
  \ causes  \ndeemed to be unlikely , it was  found  that it was  about as likely\
  \ as not  that the pilot \nwas incapacitated early in the take -off roll , prior\
  \ to the point that a turn was required \nto maintain the optimum line on the airstrip\
  \ . There was no definitive evidence to \nsupport this  finding directly; rather\
  \ , the finding  was reached through a process of \neliminating the unlikely  scenarios\
