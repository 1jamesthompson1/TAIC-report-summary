The analysis and findings focus on the mechanical failure of the rail due to a manufacturing defect and do not discuss the cognitive functions or work hours of individuals involved (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not attribute the cause of the accident to human error or incorrect assumptions. The derailment was caused by a fractured rail due to a manufacturing defect, not by human judgment or actions (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication that a lack of training or competency among personnel contributed to the derailment. The analysis focuses on the physical failure of the rail and does not mention personnel training as a factor (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","The report does not suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment played a role in the derailment. The cause was related to a rail fracture, not the operation or handling of equipment by personnel (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","Crew Resource Management was not identified as a contributing factor to the derailment. The report focuses on the mechanical aspects of the rail fracture and does not discuss crew interactions or resource management (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","The derailment was not caused by a deviation from safety procedures. The report indicates that the fracture was due to a manufacturing defect and does not mention non-compliance with safety protocols as a contributing factor (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","The organizational safety culture is not discussed as a contributing factor to the derailment. The report focuses on the technical cause of the rail fracture and does not address the values, beliefs, or behaviors within the organization (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","Risk management and analysis are not cited as factors in the derailment. The report does not discuss the identification or mitigation of risks prior to the incident, focusing instead on the rail fracture and its causes (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of a lack of regulatory oversight or non-compliance with safety regulations as contributing to the derailment. The report details the rail fracture and its origins without discussing regulatory issues (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","Situational awareness is not mentioned as a factor in the derailment. The report does not discuss the perception or understanding of the environment by individuals involved, focusing on the mechanical failure of the rail (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","0.0","Emergency response preparedness was not a contributing factor to the derailment itself. The report indicates that the first response to rescue passengers and crew was conducted appropriately (5.6).
","0.0","6.667","While maintenance and inspection regimes did not directly cause the derailment, the report notes that the chatter marks on the rail could not be observed by current inspection procedures after installation, suggesting a potential area for improvement in detecting such defects (4.5.1).
","5.774","0.0","Automation is not discussed as a contributing factor to the derailment. The report focuses on the mechanical failure of the rail and does not mention automated systems or their management (4.2.1-4.7.5).

","0.0","0.0","Communication breakdown is not identified as a contributing factor to the derailment. The report does not mention any failures in information exchange or its effects on the incident (4.2.1-4.7.5).
","0.0","93.333","The primary cause of the derailment was a manufacturing defect in the rail, specifically chatter marks introduced during the machining process, which led to a fatigue fracture (5.3). The fracture occurred in a location of maximum in-service rail loading, and there was no evidence of a wider quality issue with the supplier (5.4, 5.5). The rail had met all manufacturing standards and specifications, but the defect at the foot of the switch rail initiated the fracture (5.2, 4.3.7).","5.774","true","N/A"
