  \  \n4.1.1.  The derailment of a loaded passenger train can have serious consequences.\
  \  In this case the \ntrain was travelling at low speed and came to rest upright\
  \ only a short distance from a solid \nconcrete wall .   \n4.1.2.  The following\
  \ analysis discusses the circumstances and factors contributing to the derailment\
  \ . \n4.2. The derailment  \n4.2.1.  The point of derailment was within the left\
  \ -hand switch rail of the points, about 3.4 m etres  \npast the point of switch\
  \ in the direction of travel , at the exact point where the rail had broken  \n\
  (see F igure 3).  \n4.2.2.  It was virtually c ertain that the train derailed because\
  \  the left -hand switch rail that the train \nwas traversing at the time  was fractured\
  \ and misaligned .  Impact  marks observed on the \nswitch rail were indicative\
  \ of the point of derailment (see Figure 4 ). \n  \n \nFigure 3 \nPhotograph showing\

  \ was  a complete lateral fracture in the left -hand switch rail, which likely occurred\
  \ when it \nwas placed into the 'normal '4 position for an incoming and outgoing\
  \ train movement on \nplatform 2.  Neither of these train movements traversed the\
  \ broken switc h rail and they were \ntherefore not at risk of derailment (see Figures\
  \ 5 and 6).  \n \nFigure 6 \nStill image taken from the on -board c losed -circuit\
  \ television of train approaching point of derailment  \n4.2.4.  Although t he left-hand\
  \  switch rail had broken into  two sections , the design of the switching \nequipment\
  \  meant that the first portion of the switch rail was mo ved into the correct 'reverse'\
  \ \nposition by the spreader bars  (see Figure 7). In doing so, the elect rical\
  \ circuit  was complete  \nand this allowed the signalling system to provide a proceed\
  \ signal into the damaged section .  \nHowever, the switch rail at the platform\
  \ end of the  fracture remain ed in the normal position  as \nset for the previous\
  \ movement .  \n \nFigure 7 \nSpreader bars controlling movement of the switch rail\
  \  at the tunnel end  \n4.2.5.  As the train  passed over the fractured switch rail,\
  \ the leading left -hand wheel struck  the \nprominent face of the platform end\
  \ section , which acted as a ramp, causing the wheel to ride \nup ov er the head\
  \ of the rail and lose  guidance.  \n                                          \

  \  With the wheel flange  no longer being guided by the rails, the train could \
  \ travel in a direct line  \nalong the top of t he left -hand fixed  rail for a\
  \ short distance , before departing the track and \ndropping onto the ballast between\
  \ the two tracks .   \n4.2.7.  The driver immediately realised  that something was\
  \ wrong and activated the  train's \nemergency brake . The train's event recorder\
  \ download data showed that the emergency brake \napplication was made at 0936:42\
  \ .  The leading car of the six-car train stopp ed 16 metres  \nfrom  the point\
  \ of derailm ent and c ame to rest approximately three centimetres short of a \n\
  vertical concrete wall between platforms 1 and 2.   \n4.3. The rail fracture  examination\
  \  \n4.3.1.  Two sections of rail  cut from both sides of the fracture  were taken\
  \  from the scene  and \ntransported to DTA , located at Devonport Naval Base. \
  \ \n4.3.2.  DTA was asked to undertake three phases of work and provide a report\
  \ containing the \nfindings.  The work included:  \n\uF0B7 an optical non -destructive\
  \ examination of the fracture face and to verify the fracture \ninitiation point\
  \  \n\uF0B7 a dimensional analysis of the rail section  \n\uF0B7 a metallurgical\
  \ evaluation of the rail section  \n\uF0B7 hardness testing.  \n4.3.3.  DTA determined\
  \ that: \n\uF0B7 the rail section dimensions were consistent with its specification\
  \ s   \n\uF0B7 the initiation point of the fracture was at the foot of the rail\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the fracture  was entirely consistent with a fatigue crack .     \n\
  4.3.4.  DTA also found evidence to suggest that the fracture occurred over a short\
  \ period  of time and \nresult ed in a critical failure  of the rail . \n4.3.5.\
  \  After receiving the DTA report t he Commission decided that more in -depth testing\
  \ and an \nexamination of the rail were  required to determin e as far as possible\
  \ the exact cause of the \nfracture . \n4.3.6.  The rail sections were  then transported\
  \ to Quest for further testing that included:  \n\uF0B7 tensile testing of a sample\
  \ cut from the foot of the rail within 300 -500 millimetres  \nfrom the  fracture\
  \ face  \n\uF0B7 a residual stress test of the foot of the rail using strain gauges\
  \  to measure the \nmovement of the steel once it was cut from the main body of\
  \ the rail from the \nopposite side of the fracture to the tensile test sample \
  \ \n\uF0B7 cutting the fracture surface from the end of the rail, cut in half through\
  \ the stem of \nthe rail , so the origin of the fracture at the foot can could \
  \ be examined using a \nscanning electron microsco pe \n\uF0B7 analysing the steel\
  \ to confirm its composition using scanning electron microscope \nenergy and dispersive\
  \ X -ray spectroscopy .  \n  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report RO -2018 -101 4.3.7.\
  \  Quest concluded in part:  \nThe measured tensile residual stress of 210 Megapascals5\
  \ (MPa) was below6 the \n[maximum permissible]  value of 250 MPa specified in the\
  \ manufacturing \nstandard.  \nTensile testing of the rail section showed that the\
  \ material met all requirements \nof th e manufacturing  standard, i.e. ultimate\
  \ tensile strength of 1083 MPa and \n1067 MPa for the two samples was grea ter than\
  \ the minimum  980 MPa .  \nThe ductility (elongation percentage) of 10.2 % and\
  \ 12.9 % was greater than the \nminimum 9% specified.  \nChemical analysis indicated\
  \ that the material was compliant with KiwiRail's \nspecification for U75V material\
  \ .  \nThe rail as man ufactured met all standards and specifications required.\
  \  \nThe fracture initiated from a chatter mark7 at the foot of the switch rail\
  \ \nintroduced during the machining process in the region of a  machined chamfer\
  \ \n[see Figure  8]. The crack propagated, predominat ely by a high cycle fatigue\
  \ \nmechanism , until a critical crack size was reached, and then the final brittle\
  \ \ntransverse fracture of the rail occurred [see Figure s 8 and 9 ]. \n \nFigure\

  \ is the SI unit for pressure.  One MPa is equivalent to  \n10 bar or 145 pounds\
  \ per square inch.  A tensile residual stress of less than 250 MPa was compliant\
  \ with \nthe manufacturing specifications.  \n6 Complied  with the standard.  \n\

  \ by propagation  \n4.3.8.  The Quest report also state d in part:  \nThe as -found\
  \ condition of the machined chamfer in the rail samples supplied \nwould likely\
  \ res ult in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture \nresistance\
  \ of the rail,  all other factors being equal.  \n4.3.9.  The area of machining\
  \ defect coincided at a location of maximum in -service rail loading, \nmidway between\
  \ two sleeper supports.  \n4.4. The rail \n4.4.1.  In June 2012 KiwiRail had placed\
  \ an order for four sets of rail track points from its contracted \nsupplier in\
  \ China8.  The s upplier used a batch of rail that had been manufactured in 2009\
  \ to \nbuild the four sets of points.  The rail had been manufacture d by a different\
  \ company in \nChina9.  That company had been supplying rail to the previous owner\
  \ of the New Zealand rail \ninfrastructure , ONTRACK10, since 2006.  \n4.4.2.  All\
  \ four sets of points were later installed at Britomart during the Christmas closedown\
  \ in \n2012.  The order included the switch rail that fractured.  \n4.4.3.  The\
  \ switch rail was mechanically profiled to ensure that it could fit flush against\
  \ the fixed rail.  \nIt was very likely that chatter marks were unintentionally\
  \ machined onto the foot of the switch \nrail d uring the profiling process.  Chatter\
  \ marks refer to rough flakes protruding from the main \nbody of the rail (see Figure\
  \ 8), which in this case acted as the point of the fracture initiation.  \n4.4.4.\
  \  The s upply agreement between O NTRACK and the China Railway Shanha iguan Bridge\
  \ Group \nCompany did not specify a surface roughness standard for machined components.\
  \  The \n                                                        \n8 China Railway\
  \ Shanhaiguan Bridge Group  Company.  \n9 Pangang Group Economic and Trading Company.\
  \  \n10 ONTRACK was responsible for the mainte nance and upgrade of the rail network\
  \ before KiwiRail was \nestablished on 1 October 2008.  \n\n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final\
  \ report RO -2018 -101 supplier , with agreement from O NTRACK,  used Chinese standard\
  \ TB/TT412, 'Technical rule \nfor turnouts of standard gauge railway', which specified\
  \ a surface roughness of Ra11 25\xB5m.  \nSurface roughness was only applicable\
  \ to a normal machined surface, not  to abnormal and \nundesirable machining defects\
  \ such as chatter marks , which were irregular  and usually \nassessed against presence\
  \  and depth.    \n4.4.5.  It was a requirement of the spec ification s that the\
  \ supplier  of the points  provide d a certificate \nof compliance for each order.\
  \  KiwiRail was unable to  provide the Commission with the \ncertificate of compliance\
  \ .  Consequently it could not be established wheth er one had not been \nsupplied\
  \ or whether one had been supplied and not been retained in KiwiRail's recordkeeping\
  \ \nsystem.    \n4.4.6.  The supply ag reement provided a one -year warranty period\
  \ with the supply of each individual \norder.  Although the set of points had bee\
  \ n operating for more than five years, the fatigue \nfracture that resulted in\
  \ the failure of the switch rail initiated from one of the chatter marks \nintroduced\
  \ during the machining process  at the time of production.    \n4.4.7.  KiwiRail\
  \ had begun electronically record ing rail failures in 1995. There had been no failures\
  \ of \na similar nature on the New Zealand network since electronic recordkeeping\
  \ began.  \n4.4.8.  Records showed that 329 sets of points had been supplied by\
  \ the KiwiRail supplier and \ninstalled on the KiwiRail network  between 2006 and\
  \ 2017.  A detailed examination using an \nindustrial endoscope was carried out\
  \ on the other three  sets of points from the same batch \ninstalled at Britomart\
  \ during the  2012 Christmas shutdown .  No similar defects were found \naround\
  \ the chamfered switchblade foot.  A sample of mainline sets of points from the\
  \ other \n325 sets was also inspected.  The additional inspection  did not identify\
  \ any chatter marks \nsimilar to those  found on the failed switch rail.  \n4.4.9.\
  \  There is therefore no evidence of a  widespread quality issue with the supplier.\
  \  \nNotwithstanding this, KiwiRail had changed its supplier to an ISO -certified\
  \ company in 2016.  \nAt that time KiwiRail had adopted an improved layout design\
  \ utilising Australian Standard AS  \n1085.21 along with its own Track Specification\
  \ T-SP.21:2014 that required extensive quality \nassurance records from the manufacturer.\
  \  \n4.5. Inspection methods  \n4.5.1.  Once the switch rail had been installed\
  \ , the chatter marks located on the outer foot of the rail \ncould no longer be\
  \ observed by  current inspection procedures.  \n4.5.2.  There were three main methods\
  \ of track inspection utilised within Britomart Station limits:  \n\uF0B7 visual\
  \ inspection on foot  \n\uF0B7 inspection from the  driving  cab of a passenger\
  \ train  \n\uF0B7 non-destructive testing using ultrasonic technology . \n4.5.3.\
  \  A visual inspection of the track within Britomart Station limits had most recently\
  \  been \nconducted on 4 May 2018 ( five days prior to the incident). No track defects\
  \ had been  \nreported. The visual inspections were conducted once a week. Visual\
  \ inspections con sisted of \na person walking the track , usually between 2300\
  \ and 0500  when there was no rail traffic. \nThe inspector conducted a prescribed\
  \ series of checks on the rail, which included detailed \nprocedures for checking\
  \ points .  \n4.5.4.  Track i nspections from the drivi ng cabs of passenger trains\
  \  were conducted weekly to monitor \nthe ride quality. Any unusual kicks or bumps\
  \ observed during the inspection s would be noted \nfor follow -up action . \n4.5.5.\
  \  The detection of cracked rails is primarily done with a specialised hi -rail\
  \ vehic le using \nultrasonic testing equipment .  The probes  send sound waves\
  \ into the rail and monitor the \n                                             \
  \           \n11 Ra is the arithmetic mean roughness of a surface  from  the mean\
  \ line .  \nFinal Report RO -2018 -101 \n<< Page 13 >>\n echo es returned by the\
  \ sound waves reflecting off internal and external surfaces.  Defects \nwithin the\
  \ rail create reflectors that return unique echo patterns depending on the type,\
  \ \nlocation and size  of the defect . \n4.5.6.  Ultrasonic testing has limitations.\
  \  The d etection of defects requires skilled operators and \nequipment that can\
  \ detect a clear echo. The equipment is designed to detect cracks in the \nhead\
  \ and web of t he rail but is unable to detect a defect from the foot of the rail\
  \ unless such a  \ndefect propagated into the web  (see Figure 10) . \n \nFigure\
  \ 10 \nCross -section of the rail at t he fracture surface  with the shaded red\
  \ area representing where ultrasonic testing can \ndetect defects  \n4.5.7.  Ultrasonic\
  \ testing is  conducted every 12 weeks on the Auckland passenger network.  The most\
  \ \nrecent  inspection before the derailment had been  carried out on 18 February\
  \ 2018.  No \ndefects had been  detected  on the points .  \n4.6. Signalling system\
  \  \n4.6.1.  Traditional signalling systems use track circuitry to detect if a section\
  \ of track is occupied by a \ntrain. The weight of the train on  the track breaks\
  \ an electrical circuit , which then prevents the \nsystem si gnalling other trains\
  \ to enter  the occupied section.  \n4.6.2.  A broken rail can sometimes have the\
  \ same effect as a train occupying the section, because it \ncan (but not always)\
  \ cause the circuit to be broken.   \n4.6.3.  However, t rack circu itry is  not\
  \ a n entirely  reliable method of detecti ng broken rails. I t is \nestimated that\
  \ it indicate s an occupied track in no more than 60%  of cases.   This is \ndependent\
  \ on the type and severity of the break.  Rail operators must therefore still conduct\
  \ \nregu lar inspections  to check for broken and damaged rails . \n\n\n<< Page\
  \ 14 >>\n Final report RO -2018 -101 4.6.4.  The signalling system used in the Auckland\
  \ metropolitan area , including Britomart , is different \nfrom  those of  most\
  \ other areas in New Zealand in that rail movements are separated by an \naxle-counter\
  \ sys tem. \n4.6.5.  An axle-counter system does not require the track to be circuited.\
  \  Rail traffic is detected by \nequipment on the side of the track that recognises\
  \ when a train has entered and departed a \nparticular rail section.  \n4.6.6. \
  \ This allows for the track to be divided  into smaller sections , which in turn\
  \ provides the ability \nto run rail traffic more frequently and closer together\
  \  than traditional track -circuited systems . \n4.6.7.  The axle -counter system\
  \ is becoming the standard world -wide for managing traffic on large \npassenger\
  \  networks due to its flexibility and efficiency.  It also requires much less \n\
  maintenance than traditional track -circuited networks as there is less rail -side\
  \ equipment.  \n4.6.8.  KiwiRail increased the frequency of track inspections in\
  \ the axle -counter -controlled ar eas to \nmitigate any increased risk posed by\
  \ the lack of possible broken rail detection.  \n4.6.9.  In this case the fracture\
  \  was located on part of a switch  rail that would never have been \ndetected by\
  \ a traditional track -circuited network.  The design  of the circuitr y by necessity\
  \ does \nnot include the moving parts  of points , and therefore a track occupation\
  \ by way of a broken \nrail would not have been detected  before the derailment\
  \ occurred.  \n4.6.10.  Therefore, the use of ax le counters instead of track circuitry\
  \ to maintain separation  between \ntrains has not appreciably increased the risk\
  \ that broken rails pose to the Auckland rail \nsystem .  \n4.7. Other potential\
  \ factors considered  \n4.7.1.  Once the derailed train came to a stop the driver\
  \ made a conscious decision, because of the \nunknown status of the overhead line,\
  \ to use the radio system to make an emergency call to \ntrain control , rather\
  \ than activate the emergency red button, commonly called the ' emergency \nmushroom'.\
  \  \n4.7.2.  Had the emergency mushroom been activated when the driver realised\
  \ that the train had \nderailed, the following actions would have occurred almost\
  \ simultaneously:  \n\uF0B7 the emergency brake is applied  \n\uF0B7 the pantograph12\
  \ is lowered  \n\uF0B7 an emergency radio call to train control is initiated.  \
  \   \n4.7.3.  In this case the train was approaching the platform at about 25 kilometres\
  \ per hour and \nstopped five seconds after it derailed.  Had the driver activated\
  \ the  emergency  mushroom to \nstop the train, train control  would have been alerted\
  \ to the incident appr oximately five \nseconds earlier  irrespective of the driver's\
  \ condition after a potential impact.   The response to \nthis rare and unusual\
  \ circumstance was likely to have been appropriate on this occasion \nbecause the\
  \ additional  time that would have been requir ed to activate the emergency \nmushroom\
  \ may have resulted in the driving cab striking the end of the concrete wall.  \n\
  4.7.4.  Notwithstanding this occurrence, t he operator has instructed all its drivers\
  \ that in the event of \na train derailment, the first action s are to: depress\
  \ the emergency mushroom, respond to train \ncontrol, inform the train manager and\
  \ passengers, keep crew and passengers on the train \nuntil confirmation is received\
  \ that the overhead line has been earthed and isolate d, and wait \nfor assistance.\
  \  \n4.7.5.  The Com mission considered the effectiveness and safety of the train\
  \ evacuation and found \nthat it was carried out safely and in accordance with Transdev's\
  \ evacuation procedures.  \nPassengers were kept informed by the train crew as to\
  \ what to expect and when.   The \nCommission found no safety issues with the first\
  \ response to the accident.   \n                                               \
  \         \n12 A pantograph is a device fitted to the roof of an electric multiple\
  \ unit that allows the tra ction unit to draw \ncurrent from the contact wire of\
  \ the overhead line.  \nFinal Report RO -2018 -101 \n<< Page 15 >>"
