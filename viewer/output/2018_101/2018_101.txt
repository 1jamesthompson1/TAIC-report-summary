The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 0935 on 9 May 2018, an Auckland metropolitan passenger train was approaching 
Britomart Station with about 130 passengers on board.  The train was travelling at  
24.7 kilometres per  hour , which was below the maximum  authorised line speed  of 25 
kilometres per hour , as it passed  through a set of rail points that was supposed to divert the 
train to berth at platform 1.  However, a section of rail within the set of points had fractured, 
which caused the leading passenger car  to derail.  
1.2. The train came to rest upright, but only centimetres from a concrete wall dividing the station 
platforms .  Nobody was injured, but there was moder ate damage to the train and  the track. 
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the first response 
to rescue passengers and crew from the derailed train was conducted appropriately an d in 
accordance with the operator's procedures.  
1.4. The Commission found  that the rail from which the rail points had been manufactured met the 
required specification s.  The fracture had initiated at a machining defect on the foot of the rail , 
which was introduced during the procedure for manufacturing the set of points.   The defect  
likely resulted in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture resistance of the 
rail. 
1.5. The Commission found  no evidence that the manufacturing defect was rep resentative of a 
wider quality issue.  
1.6. The Commission did not identify any safety issues  or key lessons , and therefore made no new 
recommendations .

 Final report RO -2018 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Acc ident Investigation Commission  soon after 
the occurrence  on 9 May 2018 .  The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of 
the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , and appointed an investigator in 
charge.  
2.2. Commission investigators travelled to Auckland to conduct the site investigation  on 9 May 
2018 . 
2.3. Following the recovery of the derailed passenger train on 12 May 2018 , section s of rail were  
cut from both sides of a fracture d rail and taken to the Defence Technology Agency (DTA) for: 
 an optical non -destructive exam ination of the fracture surface to determine the fracture 
initiation point  
 a dimensional analysis of the rail section  
 a metallurgical evaluation of the rail section  
 hardness testing.  
2.4. The Commission investigators interviewed the train driver, the train ma nager, the person who 
managed the passenger evacuation, personnel responsible for the maintenance of the 
passenger train, the rail infrastructure asset manager, the rail infrastructure field engineer, 
two track inspectors and the manager responsible for th e non -destructive testing of rail way 
lines . 
2.5. On 22  January 2019 the sections of rail cut  from both  sides of the rail fracture surface were 
delivered to Quest Integrity NZL Limited (Quest) to perform the following tasks : 
 examine the origin of the fracture using a scanning electron microscope  
 determine the residual stress on the foot of the rail  
 conduct tensile test s on samples  cut from both the foot and the head of the rail within  
500 millimetres of  the fracture face  
 determine the material composition of the rail section .   
2.6. The Commission obtained the following records and documents for analysis:  
 the data downloaded from the train's event recorder  
 the train control diagram  
 the train controller's voice recordings  
 the train driver's tr aining records and timesheets  
 the train manager's training records and timesheets  
 the Interfleet Technology 'Axle Counter Risk Analysis' for the Auckland commuter network  
 a data summary of the ultrasonic rail flaw detection reports covering the previous  10 
years  
 the technical specification s for the supply of steel rail  
 the metallurgy  report from the DTA 
 the metallurgy  report from Quest .  
2.7. On 26 June 2019  the Commission approved the draft report to be sent to interested persons 
for consultation.   
2.8. Five written submissions were received.  The Commission considered the submissions, and 
changes as a result of those submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.9. On 28 August 201 9 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual informat ion 
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  Britomart Station  (Britomart) is the northern terminus of the North Island Main Trunk railway 
line.  The underground station has five dead -end platform roads and is constrained by a  
426-metre -long, double -track entrance tunnel.  Britomart wa s opened to passengers in  
July 2003.  The platform tracks  were subsequently electrified in March 2014 as part of a 
major upgrade of Auckland's commuter rail network.  All commuter trains serving Britomart 
since July 2015 have been AM -class electric multip le units.    
3.1.2.  On 9 May 2018 at about 0935, a six -car electric multiple unit passenger train approached 
Britomart with about 130 passengers on board. The train , operated by Transdev  Auckland 
Limited (Transdev) , was crewed by a train driver and a train man ager. The train consisted of 
two sets of three cars coupled together. The trai n manager was travelling in the front portion 
of the  train . There was no internal access between the two sets .  
3.1.3.  The train was travelling at 24.7  kilometres per hour  when it passed  the signal  informing the 
driver that the train had been  route d to berth on platform 1 (see Figure 1).  The maximum 
authorised line speed to pass the signal was 25 kilometres per hour.  
 
Figure 1 
Britomart Station track layout   
3.1.4.  At about 093 7 the leading wheels of the first passenger car derailed as it passed over  a 
broken rail within a set of points2 (the points) that routed the train from the platform 2 road 
towards  platform 1 .  The first car of the train left the rails and travelled along the ballast 
between two tracks.  The train driver applied the emergency brakes  and stopp ed the train  
about 16 metres  past the point of derailment3.  The driving cab came to rest close to a vertical 
concrete wall (see Figure 2).   There were no injuries to passenger s or crew.

3.2. Recovery  
3.2.1.  At about 0938 t he train driver informed the t rain controller by radio t hat the train had derailed 
on approach to platform 1, and request ed an emergency  overhead  power isolation.  The train 
controller acknowledged the request and instructed the driver to keep crew  and passengers 
on the train until confirmation was given that the overhead power had been earthed and 
isolated.  
3.2.2.  The Transdev train crew manager was informed by telephone of a possible derailment by a 
colleague travelling on another train . The train crew manager was also a qualified rail incident 
controller (RIC) and was located at the Transdev offices, a sho rt distance  from the scene.  
3.2.3.  The train crew manager assumed duties as RIC and deployed to Britomart Station to manage 
the evacua tion of what was then thought to be about 30 passengers.  
3.2.4.  The RIC received confirmation at 0959 that the overhead power had been isolated and 
earthed in preparation for the passenger evacuation.  The RIC , assisted by two Auckland 
Transport station managers , started  the evacuation process from the leading set  of three 
passenger cars  shortly after  receiving this confirmation .  
3.2.5.  Passengers were assisted down a ladder placed against the middle car and were then 
assembled o n a concreted  area clear of the rail corr idor. Similarly, passengers were then 
assisted from the middle car of the rear  three -car set . 
3.2.6.  By 1047 a bout 130 passengers had been escorted safely to the platform .  Train crew then 
conducted a final check before leaving the train. The R IC handed the accid ent site back to the 
network controller at 1102 .

 3.3. Key personnel  
3.3.1.  The train driver worked out of the drivers' depot at Wiri  and had nearly four  years' driving 
experience , which included  in both diesel and electric multiple units .  The driver's operating 
certification was current.   
3.3.2.  The train driver underwent  a post -incident drug and alcohol test that returned a negative 
result for both.  
3.3.3.  The train manager  had about 13 years' experience in the role and had been  regularly trained 
in emergency scenarios , including tunnel evacuation s training.  
3.3.4.  The RIC was an experienced train driver , and for the previous  four years had been performing 
the role of train crew manager based in the headquarters of Transdev Auckland.

 Final report RO -2018 -101 4. Analysis   
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The derailment of a loaded passenger train can have serious consequences.  In this case the 
train was travelling at low speed and came to rest upright only a short distance from a solid 
concrete wall .   
4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses the circumstances and factors contributing to the derailment . 
4.2. The derailment  
4.2.1.  The point of derailment was within the left -hand switch rail of the points, about 3.4 m etres  
past the point of switch in the direction of travel , at the exact point where the rail had broken  
(see F igure 3).  
4.2.2.  It was virtually c ertain that the train derailed because  the left -hand switch rail that the train 
was traversing at the time  was fractured and misaligned .  Impact  marks observed on the 
switch rail were indicative of the point of derailment (see Figure 4 ).

 Final report RO -2018 -101 4.2.3.  There was  a complete lateral fracture in the left -hand switch rail, which likely occurred when it 
was placed into the 'normal '4 position for an incoming and outgoing train movement on 
platform 2.  Neither of these train movements traversed the broken switc h rail and they were 
therefore not at risk of derailment (see Figures 5 and 6).  
 
Figure 6 
Still image taken from the on -board c losed -circuit television of train approaching point of derailment  
4.2.4.  Although t he left-hand  switch rail had broken into  two sections , the design of the switching 
equipment  meant that the first portion of the switch rail was mo ved into the correct 'reverse' 
position by the spreader bars  (see Figure 7). In doing so, the elect rical circuit  was complete  
and this allowed the signalling system to provide a proceed signal into the damaged section .  
However, the switch rail at the platform end of the  fracture remain ed in the normal position  as 
set for the previous movement .  
 
Figure 7 
Spreader bars controlling movement of the switch rail  at the tunnel end  
4.2.5.  As the train  passed over the fractured switch rail, the leading left -hand wheel struck  the 
prominent face of the platform end section , which acted as a ramp, causing the wheel to ride 
up ov er the head of the rail and lose  guidance.

 4.2.6.  With the wheel flange  no longer being guided by the rails, the train could  travel in a direct line  
along the top of t he left -hand fixed  rail for a short distance , before departing the track and 
dropping onto the ballast between the two tracks .   
4.2.7.  The driver immediately realised  that something was wrong and activated the  train's 
emergency brake . The train's event recorder download data showed that the emergency brake 
application was made at 0936:42 .  The leading car of the six-car train stopp ed 16 metres  
from  the point of derailm ent and c ame to rest approximately three centimetres short of a 
vertical concrete wall between platforms 1 and 2.   
4.3. The rail fracture  examination  
4.3.1.  Two sections of rail  cut from both sides of the fracture  were taken  from the scene  and 
transported to DTA , located at Devonport Naval Base.  
4.3.2.  DTA was asked to undertake three phases of work and provide a report containing the 
findings.  The work included:  
 an optical non -destructive examination of the fracture face and to verify the fracture 
initiation point  
 a dimensional analysis of the rail section  
 a metallurgical evaluation of the rail section  
 hardness testing.  
4.3.3.  DTA determined that: 
 the rail section dimensions were consistent with its specification s   
 the initiation point of the fracture was at the foot of the rail  
 the fracture  was entirely consistent with a fatigue crack .     
4.3.4.  DTA also found evidence to suggest that the fracture occurred over a short period  of time and 
result ed in a critical failure  of the rail . 
4.3.5.  After receiving the DTA report t he Commission decided that more in -depth testing and an 
examination of the rail were  required to determin e as far as possible the exact cause of the 
fracture . 
4.3.6.  The rail sections were  then transported to Quest for further testing that included:  
 tensile testing of a sample cut from the foot of the rail within 300 -500 millimetres  
from the  fracture face  
 a residual stress test of the foot of the rail using strain gauges  to measure the 
movement of the steel once it was cut from the main body of the rail from the 
opposite side of the fracture to the tensile test sample  
 cutting the fracture surface from the end of the rail, cut in half through the stem of 
the rail , so the origin of the fracture at the foot can could  be examined using a 
scanning electron microsco pe 
 analysing the steel to confirm its composition using scanning electron microscope 
energy and dispersive X -ray spectroscopy .  
  

<< Page 10 >>
 Final report RO -2018 -101 4.3.7.  Quest concluded in part:  
The measured tensile residual stress of 210 Megapascals5 (MPa) was below6 the 
[maximum permissible]  value of 250 MPa specified in the manufacturing 
standard.  
Tensile testing of the rail section showed that the material met all requirements 
of th e manufacturing  standard, i.e. ultimate tensile strength of 1083 MPa and 
1067 MPa for the two samples was grea ter than the minimum  980 MPa .  
The ductility (elongation percentage) of 10.2 % and 12.9 % was greater than the 
minimum 9% specified.  
Chemical analysis indicated that the material was compliant with KiwiRail's 
specification for U75V material .  
The rail as man ufactured met all standards and specifications required.  
The fracture initiated from a chatter mark7 at the foot of the switch rail 
introduced during the machining process in the region of a  machined chamfer 
[see Figure  8]. The crack propagated, predominat ely by a high cycle fatigue 
mechanism , until a critical crack size was reached, and then the final brittle 
transverse fracture of the rail occurred [see Figure s 8 and 9 ].

5 One MPa is one million of the pascal units, which is the SI unit for pressure.  One MPa is equivalent to  
10 bar or 145 pounds per square inch.  A tensile residual stress of less than 250 MPa was compliant with 
the manufacturing specifications.

4.3.8.  The Quest report also state d in part:  
The as -found condition of the machined chamfer in the rail samples supplied 
would likely res ult in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture 
resistance of the rail,  all other factors being equal.  
4.3.9.  The area of machining defect coincided at a location of maximum in -service rail loading, 
midway between two sleeper supports.  
4.4. The rail 
4.4.1.  In June 2012 KiwiRail had placed an order for four sets of rail track points from its contracted 
supplier in China8.  The s upplier used a batch of rail that had been manufactured in 2009 to 
build the four sets of points.  The rail had been manufacture d by a different company in 
China9.  That company had been supplying rail to the previous owner of the New Zealand rail 
infrastructure , ONTRACK10, since 2006.  
4.4.2.  All four sets of points were later installed at Britomart during the Christmas closedown in 
2012.  The order included the switch rail that fractured.  
4.4.3.  The switch rail was mechanically profiled to ensure that it could fit flush against the fixed rail.  
It was very likely that chatter marks were unintentionally machined onto the foot of the switch 
rail d uring the profiling process.  Chatter marks refer to rough flakes protruding from the main 
body of the rail (see Figure 8), which in this case acted as the point of the fracture initiation.  
4.4.4.  The s upply agreement between O NTRACK and the China Railway Shanha iguan Bridge Group 
Company did not specify a surface roughness standard for machined components.  The

established on 1 October 2008.

 Final report RO -2018 -101 supplier , with agreement from O NTRACK,  used Chinese standard TB/TT412, 'Technical rule 
for turnouts of standard gauge railway', which specified a surface roughness of Ra11 25µm.  
Surface roughness was only applicable to a normal machined surface, not  to abnormal and 
undesirable machining defects such as chatter marks , which were irregular  and usually 
assessed against presence  and depth.    
4.4.5.  It was a requirement of the spec ification s that the supplier  of the points  provide d a certificate 
of compliance for each order.  KiwiRail was unable to  provide the Commission with the 
certificate of compliance .  Consequently it could not be established wheth er one had not been 
supplied or whether one had been supplied and not been retained in KiwiRail's recordkeeping 
system.    
4.4.6.  The supply ag reement provided a one -year warranty period with the supply of each individual 
order.  Although the set of points had bee n operating for more than five years, the fatigue 
fracture that resulted in the failure of the switch rail initiated from one of the chatter marks 
introduced during the machining process  at the time of production.    
4.4.7.  KiwiRail had begun electronically record ing rail failures in 1995. There had been no failures of 
a similar nature on the New Zealand network since electronic recordkeeping began.  
4.4.8.  Records showed that 329 sets of points had been supplied by the KiwiRail supplier and 
installed on the KiwiRail network  between 2006 and 2017.  A detailed examination using an 
industrial endoscope was carried out on the other three  sets of points from the same batch 
installed at Britomart during the  2012 Christmas shutdown .  No similar defects were found 
around the chamfered switchblade foot.  A sample of mainline sets of points from the other 
325 sets was also inspected.  The additional inspection  did not identify any chatter marks 
similar to those  found on the failed switch rail.  
4.4.9.  There is therefore no evidence of a  widespread quality issue with the supplier.  
Notwithstanding this, KiwiRail had changed its supplier to an ISO -certified company in 2016.  
At that time KiwiRail had adopted an improved layout design utilising Australian Standard AS  
1085.21 along with its own Track Specification T-SP.21:2014 that required extensive quality 
assurance records from the manufacturer.  
4.5. Inspection methods  
4.5.1.  Once the switch rail had been installed , the chatter marks located on the outer foot of the rail 
could no longer be observed by  current inspection procedures.  
4.5.2.  There were three main methods of track inspection utilised within Britomart Station limits:  
 visual inspection on foot  
 inspection from the  driving  cab of a passenger train  
 non-destructive testing using ultrasonic technology . 
4.5.3.  A visual inspection of the track within Britomart Station limits had most recently  been 
conducted on 4 May 2018 ( five days prior to the incident). No track defects had been  
reported. The visual inspections were conducted once a week. Visual inspections con sisted of 
a person walking the track , usually between 2300 and 0500  when there was no rail traffic. 
The inspector conducted a prescribed series of checks on the rail, which included detailed 
procedures for checking points .  
4.5.4.  Track i nspections from the drivi ng cabs of passenger trains  were conducted weekly to monitor 
the ride quality. Any unusual kicks or bumps observed during the inspection s would be noted 
for follow -up action . 
4.5.5.  The detection of cracked rails is primarily done with a specialised hi -rail vehic le using 
ultrasonic testing equipment .  The probes  send sound waves into the rail and monitor the 
                                                        
11 Ra is the arithmetic mean roughness of a surface  from  the mean line .

 echo es returned by the sound waves reflecting off internal and external surfaces.  Defects 
within the rail create reflectors that return unique echo patterns depending on the type, 
location and size  of the defect . 
4.5.6.  Ultrasonic testing has limitations.  The d etection of defects requires skilled operators and 
equipment that can detect a clear echo. The equipment is designed to detect cracks in the 
head and web of t he rail but is unable to detect a defect from the foot of the rail unless such a  
defect propagated into the web  (see Figure 10) .

4.5.7.  Ultrasonic testing is  conducted every 12 weeks on the Auckland passenger network.  The most 
recent  inspection before the derailment had been  carried out on 18 February 2018.  No 
defects had been  detected  on the points .  
4.6. Signalling system  
4.6.1.  Traditional signalling systems use track circuitry to detect if a section of track is occupied by a 
train. The weight of the train on  the track breaks an electrical circuit , which then prevents the 
system si gnalling other trains to enter  the occupied section.  
4.6.2.  A broken rail can sometimes have the same effect as a train occupying the section, because it 
can (but not always) cause the circuit to be broken.   
4.6.3.  However, t rack circu itry is  not a n entirely  reliable method of detecti ng broken rails. I t is 
estimated that it indicate s an occupied track in no more than 60%  of cases.   This is 
dependent on the type and severity of the break.  Rail operators must therefore still conduct 
regu lar inspections  to check for broken and damaged rails .

 Final report RO -2018 -101 4.6.4.  The signalling system used in the Auckland metropolitan area , including Britomart , is different 
from  those of  most other areas in New Zealand in that rail movements are separated by an 
axle-counter sys tem. 
4.6.5.  An axle-counter system does not require the track to be circuited.  Rail traffic is detected by 
equipment on the side of the track that recognises when a train has entered and departed a 
particular rail section.  
4.6.6.  This allows for the track to be divided  into smaller sections , which in turn provides the ability 
to run rail traffic more frequently and closer together  than traditional track -circuited systems . 
4.6.7.  The axle -counter system is becoming the standard world -wide for managing traffic on large 
passenger  networks due to its flexibility and efficiency.  It also requires much less 
maintenance than traditional track -circuited networks as there is less rail -side equipment.  
4.6.8.  KiwiRail increased the frequency of track inspections in the axle -counter -controlled ar eas to 
mitigate any increased risk posed by the lack of possible broken rail detection.  
4.6.9.  In this case the fracture  was located on part of a switch  rail that would never have been 
detected by a traditional track -circuited network.  The design  of the circuitr y by necessity does 
not include the moving parts  of points , and therefore a track occupation by way of a broken 
rail would not have been detected  before the derailment occurred.  
4.6.10.  Therefore, the use of ax le counters instead of track circuitry to maintain separation  between 
trains has not appreciably increased the risk that broken rails pose to the Auckland rail 
system .  
4.7. Other potential factors considered  
4.7.1.  Once the derailed train came to a stop the driver made a conscious decision, because of the 
unknown status of the overhead line, to use the radio system to make an emergency call to 
train control , rather than activate the emergency red button, commonly called the ' emergency 
mushroom'.  
4.7.2.  Had the emergency mushroom been activated when the driver realised that the train had 
derailed, the following actions would have occurred almost simultaneously:  
 the emergency brake is applied  
 the pantograph12 is lowered  
 an emergency radio call to train control is initiated.     
4.7.3.  In this case the train was approaching the platform at about 25 kilometres per hour and 
stopped five seconds after it derailed.  Had the driver activated the  emergency  mushroom to 
stop the train, train control  would have been alerted to the incident appr oximately five 
seconds earlier  irrespective of the driver's condition after a potential impact.   The response to 
this rare and unusual circumstance was likely to have been appropriate on this occasion 
because the additional  time that would have been requir ed to activate the emergency 
mushroom may have resulted in the driving cab striking the end of the concrete wall.  
4.7.4.  Notwithstanding this occurrence, t he operator has instructed all its drivers that in the event of 
a train derailment, the first action s are to: depress the emergency mushroom, respond to train 
control, inform the train manager and passengers, keep crew and passengers on the train 
until confirmation is received that the overhead line has been earthed and isolate d, and wait 
for assistance.  
4.7.5.  The Com mission considered the effectiveness and safety of the train evacuation and found 
that it was carried out safely and in accordance with Transdev's evacuation procedures.  
Passengers were kept informed by the train crew as to what to expect and when.   The 
Commission found no safety issues with the first response to the accident.   
                                                        
12 A pantograph is a device fitted to the roof of an electric multiple unit that allows the tra ction unit to draw 
current from the contact wire of the overhead line.

 5. Findings  
5.1. It is virtually certain that the train derailed because the left -hand -side switch rail that the train 
was traversing at the time was fractured and  had become misaligned.  
5.2. The chemical composition and material properties of the rail section complied with the rail 
specification s, and were  not factor s contributing to the fractured rail.  
5.3. The fracture initiated at a  manufacturing defect  where a chamfer had been machined  on the 
foot of a switch rail which  likely resulted in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and 
fracture resistance of the rail . 
5.4. The fracture initiation point was in a location of maximum in -service rail loading, midway 
between two sleeper supports.  
5.5. There was no evidence that the manufacturing defect was representative of a wider quality 
issue.  
5.6. The first response to rescue passengers and crew from the derailed train was conducted 
appropriately and in accordance with the operator's procedures .

 7. Safety a ctions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issue s identified during an inquiry  
7.2.1.  No safety issues identified . 
7.3. Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
7.3.1.  The KiwiRail track inspection regime has moved from a reactive inspection  to predictive 
assurance in accordance with Track Standard T -ST-IN- 5109 . 
7.3.2.  An independent wheel/rail interface working group has been established to resolve any 
potential rail wear issues within the Auck land passenger network.

 Final report RO -2018 -101 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.    
8.1.2.  In the inte rests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Recommendations  
8.2.1.  No new recommendations issued .
