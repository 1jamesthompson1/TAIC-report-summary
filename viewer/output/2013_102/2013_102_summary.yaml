- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The trainee and minder driver's lapse in concentration and the incorrect assumption that the right-away buzzer had sounded contributed significantly to the incident. "The premature departure of the train from the station could be explained as a simple lapse in concentration by the trainee and minder driver" (4.1.3). Additionally, both the trainee and the minder driver thought they had heard the right-away buzzer, which was not possible since "the event recorder showed that the right-away button was never depressed" (4.1.2).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The trainee's inexperience played a role in the incident, as he failed to notice that the all-doors-closed light was not illuminated, which could be attributed to his limited experience (4.1.3). Although the trainee had practiced the departure procedure many times before, the actual event revealed a gap in his training or competency in managing the situation (4.1.6).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The trainee powered up the train without receiving the required right-away signal from the train manager, indicating a failure to adhere to safety procedures (5.1). This lack of adherence to the established safety protocol was a direct contributor to the incident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The absence of an interlock on the Ganz Mavag sets, which placed greater reliance on driver performance, indicates an organizational approach that may not have sufficiently prioritized the integration of fail-safes into the safety culture (4.1.4, 4.1.5). The decision not to modify the Ganz Mavag sets due to their impending decommissioning also reflects organizational priorities that affected safety (4.2.8).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The lack of a radio for immediate contact between the train manager and the trainee to stop the train contributed to the incident. "Once the train manager and assistant train manager were left on the platform, they had no radio by which they could make immediate contact with the trainee to stop the train" (4.1.7). This communication breakdown prevented a timely response to the situation.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The design of the door-alert system did not follow the conventional red/green light system, which could have more clearly indicated the unsafe condition of open doors. This design choice represents a risk that was not adequately mitigated (4.2.1). Additionally, the decision not to modify the Ganz Mavag sets due to their upcoming decommissioning reflects a risk management decision that influenced the level of safety (4.2.8).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The report does not directly address regulatory oversight and compliance as a contributing factor. However, the adherence to historical design conventions and the decision not to upgrade the Ganz Mavag sets suggest that regulatory standards may not have compelled sufficient safety enhancements (4.2.2-4.2.4).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The minder driver's oversight of the trainee was appropriate for the stage of the trainee's training program, but the incident suggests that there may have been a lack of effective crew resource management in the critical moment leading to the train's departure (4.1.6).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is insufficient information in the document to suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with the equipment directly contributed to the incident. The trainee had practiced the departure procedure many times before (4.1.6).
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue or overwork as factors in the incident, so it cannot be concluded that fatigue management played a role (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide evidence that a lack of situational awareness, in general, was a contributing factor, aside from the specific oversight of the door-status light (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The incident did not involve an emergency response scenario, so this theme is not applicable to the contributing factors of the incident (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The door and alarm system were operating normally according to the post-incident test, indicating that maintenance and inspection regimes were not a contributing factor (4.1.2).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The incident was not related to the use or misuse of automation, as the Ganz Mavag sets lacked the interlocks present in the newer Matangi sets (4.1.4).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions were not mentioned as a factor in the incident, so they did not contribute to the accident (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: No additional safety themes outside of the provided list were identified as contributing factors in the document (Insufficient information).
