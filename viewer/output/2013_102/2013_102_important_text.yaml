  \  \n4.1.1.  A train travelling between stations with the passenger doors open and\
  \ no passenger crew on \nboard can be  a serious safety issue.  The risk of a passenger\
  \ falling out of a doorway on this \noccasion was relatively low because there were\
  \ only 12 passengers on the train , who could be \nseated .  However, it would have\
  \ been different if the train had been fully loaded with \npassengers standing in\
  \ the vicinity of  the door recesses.  \n4.1.2.  The post -incident test on the\
  \ passenger  door and alarm system showed that it was operating \nnormally.  Both\
  \ the trainee and the minder driver said that they thought they had heard the \n\
  right -away buzzer, but t he event recorder showed that the right -away button was\
  \ never \ndepressed by the t rain manager  and that the doors were still open when\
  \ the train departed.  \nThe right -away buzzer could not have sounded, nor could\
  \ the all-door s-closed light have \nilluminated in the driver's cab.  \n4.1.3.\
  \  The premature departure of the train from the station could be explained as a\
  \ simple lapse in \nconcentration by the trainee  and minder driver .  The train\
  \ was running five minutes late and \nthe trainee had a green signal ahead of his\
  \ train.  The train had been stopped for about 10 \nseconds when  he first applied\
  \ power t o move away from the station.  With so few passengers \non board, 10 seconds\
  \ would not have been much less than the average time for the train to \nbe stopped\
  \ .  The fact that he did not notice that the all-doors -closed light in front of\
  \ him was \nnot illuminated  could be  attributed to inexperience.  \n4.1.4.  Tranz\
  \ Metro's right -away procedures were similar for both the Ganz Mavag and the newer\
  \ \nMatangi sets.  The main difference between the two types was that the Matangi\
  \ sets had \nadditional interlock s that prevented  driver s powering up the train\
  \ s with any operational9 \npassenger doors still open.  This incident would not\
  \ have occurred h ad an interlock been fitted \nto the Ganz Mavag sets. \n4.1.5.\
  \  The absence of the interlock on the Ganz Mavag sets placed a gr eater reliance\
  \ on driver \nperformance and the design of the door -alert  system to prevent a\
  \ premature train departure.   \nThere is a potential safety issue with the ergonomics\
  \ of the driver door -alert  system on the \nGanz Mavag sets, which is discussed\
  \ in more detail below.  \n4.1.6.  The trainee ha d practised the departure procedure\
  \ many times before , with no recorded \nissues  during his limited train -driving\
  \ experience .  The minder driver's oversight of the trainee , \nin being outside\
  \ the driving cab when the train departed, was appropriate for the stage of the\
  \ \ntrainee's training program me.  Nevertheless, Tranz Metro  implemented a number\
  \ of safety \ninitiatives to improve the training program me.  The detail of these\
  \ safety initiatives is included \nin the \"Safety action s\" section of this report.\
  \  \n4.1.7.  One othe r safety issue arose , and that was  that once the train manager\
  \ and assistant train \nmanager  were left on the platform, they had no radio by\
  \ which they could make  immediate \ncontact with the trainee to stop the train\
  \ .  This matter is  also discussed in the fol lowing \nsections.  \n  \n      \
  \                                                  \n9 An individual door can be\
  \ isolated in the event of a malfunction.  In such a case the tra in would be \n\
  able to depart but the driver would be alerted on their  traffic monitoring screen.\
  \  There are special \nprocedures for this eventuality.  \n  \nFinal report RO -2013\
  \ -102 \n<< Page 7 >>\n 4.2. Door -alert  system  \n4.2.1.  There is a convention,\
  \ in almost all disciplines, where the colour red means \"danger \" or \"stop\"\
  \ \nand green means \"go\" or \"safe\".  If the design of the passenger door -alert\
  \  system  had \nfollowed this convention, there would have been two lights for\
  \ indicating the status of the \ndoors.  One would have been red and would  have\
  \  illuminate d when the doors were open, and \nthe other would have been green\
  \ to indicate the doors had closed, or that it was safe to \nproceed.  In this case\
  \ the safe condition was represented by an illuminated white light and the \nunsafe\
  \ condition by the light not being illuminated .  In other words there was no light\
  \ to draw a \ndriver's attention to an unsafe condition.  \n4.2.2.  The concept\
  \ of an illuminated  white light to signal all passenger doors as closed was \n\
  historical , originat ing from  the very first design of electr ic multiple unit\
  \  sets, built by English \nElectric of Great Britain and introduced to Wellington\
  \ in the late 1940s.  \n4.2.3.  The concept was replicated on the Ganz Mavag sets\
  \ when they were introduced to the fleet in \n1982 to achieve consistency  for drivers\
  \  operating between the Ganz Mavag and English  \nElectric sets, up to as recent\
  \ ly as 2012  when the last English Electric set was \ndecommissioned .  The concept\
  \ was again replicated on the Matangi sets because of the \nparallel  operation\
  \ of the Ganz Mavag and Matangi sets  between 2011 and 2016, when the \nGanz Mavag\
  \ sets are due to be decommissioned . \n4.2.4.  The concept of a single white light\
  \ was considered to be failsafe.  That is, if the bulb in the \nlight was not working\
  \ a driver would assume that the passenger doors were still open.  Tranz \nMetro\
  \ had an established procedure for checking  if that were the ca se.  However, a\
  \ driver \nwould first have to notice that the light was not illuminated.  In this\
  \ case the trainee  failed to \nnotice this.  \n4.2.5.  The design of the door -status\
  \ system on the new electric multiple unit sets undergoing testing \non the Auckland\
  \ metro politan system  is the same as that used on the Wellington sets . \n4.2.6.\
  \  However , there is an interlock on the new Auckland sets, as well as the Matangi\
  \ sets , that will \nprevent a train being powered up unless all the operational\
  \  passenger doors are closed.  \nAdditio nally , and as in the Matangi  sets, the\
  \ driver has an electronic screen showing the status \nof every door on the train.\
  \  The risk of these new sets in Auckland and Wellington departing \nstation s with\
  \ the doors open is therefore low.  \n4.2.7.  There is some safety benef it in having\
  \ a standard passenger door -alert  system across \ndifferent sets operating on\
  \ the same network, but that system should alert the driver s to the \ndoor status\
  \ in a clear and unambiguous way.  Statistics show that it is rare for drivers of\
  \ Ganz \nMavag sets to misinterpret or fail to recognise door -status lights.  Nevertheless,\
  \ this incident \nshows that it can happen.  \n4.2.8.  The Greater Wellington Regional\
  \ Council confirmed that it plans to withdraw all the Ganz \nMavag sets from operation\
  \ s by April 2016.  Therefore the costs and time required to modify \nthe sets are\
  \ not likely to be warranted because the progressive withdrawal of the sets will\
  \ \nresult in an acceptable level of diminishing residual risk.  \n4.2.9.  Modifying\
  \ the all -door -closed light on the Matangi sets is also not likely to be warranted\
  \ , \nbecause these sets have an additional interlock that prevents the driver power\
  \ ing their  train \nwhile any operational door is open . \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final\
  \ report RO -2013 -102 4.3. Communication  \n4.3.1.  When the train manager and\
  \ assistant train manager  were left standing on the station \nplatform, the train\
  \ manager did not have a radio with her . \n4.3.2.  The Commission raised the issue\
  \ of communication between train managers and train drivers \nin a report10 published\
  \ in August 2008 , which included a recommendation to the NZ Transport \nAgency\
  \  that train managers be provided with portable radios that had the same local\
  \ channel \nfrequenc y as the train drivers ' cab radio s.  This would have left\
  \  them free to roam the trains as \nrequired, and always have the capability to\
  \ con verse with the drivers in case s of emergenc y or \nfor other special operational\
  \ requirements . \n4.3.3.  The recommendation was subsequently closed on 24 September\
  \ 2013 on the understanding \nthat radios had been purchased for all metropolitan\
  \ trains in the Auckland and Wellington \nareas.   In Auckland the radios were issued\
  \ by the operator to the train manager on every train.  \n4.3.4.  In Wellington\
  \ , Tranz Metro installed portable radios in both the Ganz Mavag and Matangi sets.\
  \  \nHowever, Tranz Metro's  policy was for these radios to not be carried by the\
  \ train managers.  \nTranz Metro preferred to have the radios permanently installed\
  \ on their charging units near to \nthe drivers ' cabs, to be used only in the event\
  \ of an emergency.  Instead Tranz Metro  issued \nthe train managers with mobil\
  \ e telephones pre -programmed with the train control number to \nenable them to\
  \ converse directly with train control in the event of an emergency11.  Train \n\
  control would then contact the driver s. \n4.3.5.  The main reason Tranz Metro gave\
  \ for adopting this policy was con cern that giving train \nmanagers portable radios\
  \ could result in unnecessary radio \"chatter \", a potential source of \ndistraction\
  \ for its drivers . \n4.3.6.  Relying on m obile telephones for critical communications\
  \ had its limitations.  For example, \nreception was not guaranteed when trains\
  \ were  in tunnels, and t rain drivers were  not issued \nwith company mobile phones,\
  \ so train man agers could only contact them through train control \nif, owing to\
  \  the nature of an emergency, they could not access radio s.  This could lim it\
  \ a train \ncrew's ability to manage  effectively  an emergency on board  their\
  \ own train, by having to \ncommunicate with each o ther via the train controller.\
  \  \n4.3.7.  Trains departing without passenger crew o n board and with all doors\
  \ open are  not likely to \noccur frequ ently,  but the Commission's recommendation\
  \ was aimed at train crews being able \nto communicate  quickly and effectively\
  \  in any emergency situation.  It is important that train \ndrivers and train managers\
  \ are able to contact train control, either b y radio or b y mobile \nphone.  Providing\
  \ portable radios  fixed  in each two-car set and mobile phones to train \nmanager\
  \ s will in almost every case enable that to happen.  \n4.3.8.  However, it is equally\
  \ important that train managers and train drivers are able to communicate \ndirectly\
  \ with one another in emergencies.  The fixing of portable radios in each two-car\
  \ set will \nin most situations enable that to happen.  However, there will be a\
  \ residual risk that in the \nevent of some emergency situations, train ma nagers\
  \ might not be able to acces s the fixed \nportable radio s.  That  risk will need\
  \ to be considered in relation to Tranz Metro's concern over \nthe potential for\
  \ train driver distraction  caused through unnecessary radio chatter, and how \n\
  that might be managed . \n \n                                                  \

  \ from Britomart to Quay Park \nJunction, Auckland, Recommendation 016/08.  \n11\
  \ In this case the train control number had not been pre -programmed into the telephones,\
  \ but it has been \nprogrammed into all mobile telephones since this incident. \
