","0.0","30.0","The trainee and minder driver's lapse in concentration and the incorrect assumption that the right-away buzzer had sounded contributed significantly to the incident. ""The premature departure of the train from the station could be explained as a simple lapse in concentration by the trainee and minder driver"" (4.1.3). Additionally, both the trainee and the minder driver thought they had heard the right-away buzzer, which was not possible since ""the event recorder showed that the right-away button was never depressed"" (4.1.2).
","0.0","20.0","The trainee's inexperience played a role in the incident, as he failed to notice that the all-doors-closed light was not illuminated, which could be attributed to his limited experience (4.1.3). Although the trainee had practiced the departure procedure many times before, the actual event revealed a gap in his training or competency in managing the situation (4.1.6).
","0.0","1.667","There is insufficient information in the document to suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with the equipment directly contributed to the incident. The trainee had practiced the departure procedure many times before (4.1.6).
","2.887","5.0","The minder driver's oversight of the trainee was appropriate for the stage of the trainee's training program, but the incident suggests that there may have been a lack of effective crew resource management in the critical moment leading to the train's departure (4.1.6).
","0.0","15.0","The trainee powered up the train without receiving the required right-away signal from the train manager, indicating a failure to adhere to safety procedures (5.1). This lack of adherence to the established safety protocol was a direct contributor to the incident.
","0.0","10.0","The absence of an interlock on the Ganz Mavag sets, which placed greater reliance on driver performance, indicates an organizational approach that may not have sufficiently prioritized the integration of fail-safes into the safety culture (4.1.4, 4.1.5). The decision not to modify the Ganz Mavag sets due to their impending decommissioning also reflects organizational priorities that affected safety (4.2.8).
","0.0","3.333","The design of the door-alert system did not follow the conventional red/green light system, which could have more clearly indicated the unsafe condition of open doors. This design choice represents a risk that was not adequately mitigated (4.2.1). Additionally, the decision not to modify the Ganz Mavag sets due to their upcoming decommissioning reflects a risk management decision that influenced the level of safety (4.2.8).
","2.887","3.333","The report does not directly address regulatory oversight and compliance as a contributing factor. However, the adherence to historical design conventions and the decision not to upgrade the Ganz Mavag sets suggest that regulatory standards may not have compelled sufficient safety enhancements (4.2.2-4.2.4).
","2.887","0.0","The document does not provide evidence that a lack of situational awareness, in general, was a contributing factor, aside from the specific oversight of the door-status light (Insufficient information).
