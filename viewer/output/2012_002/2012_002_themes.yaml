- name: Engine Performance Monitoring
  explanation: Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme as it involves the detection and management of potential engine issues before they result in an incident. In this accident, the engine failure was a direct result of damage from a bird strike that was not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control (MOC) due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system ("Indications that the right-hand engine was not performing well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system" (4.3.7)). The failure to detect the engine's deteriorating performance meant that the crew and MOC were not alerted to the potential problem, which could have allowed for earlier intervention and possibly prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.
- name: Wildlife Hazard Management
  explanation: Wildlife hazard management is a safety theme that addresses the risk of wildlife, such as birds, interacting with aircraft, which can lead to dangerous situations like bird strikes. This accident was initiated by a bird strike event when a black-backed gull was ingested into the engine core ("It is highly likely that this contained engine failure was the result of a single bird strike event on the previous flight when the aeroplane was landing at Wellington Aerodrome" (5.1)). Although Wellington International Airport had an effective bird management program in place ("Wellington International Airport is providing an effective bird management programme that is keeping the risk of bird strikes as low as reasonably practicable" (5.5)), the incident underscores the importance of continuous improvement and vigilance in wildlife hazard management programs.
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Inspections
  explanation: Maintenance procedures and inspections are a safety theme that involves the processes and checks carried out to ensure aircraft are fit for flight. In this case, the engineer who inspected the aircraft at Wellington followed the prescribed procedure for a bird strike and performed additional actions to identify any damage. Despite these efforts, no damage was found, and the aircraft was released back into service ("The engineer who carried out the inspection at Wellington followed the prescribed procedure for a bird strike" (4.1.2)). The subsequent engine failure early in the 10-hour allowance highlights the importance of effective maintenance procedures and the potential need for more stringent inspection protocols following incidents such as bird strikes.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  explanation: Risk management and analysis is a safety theme that involves assessing potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate risks. The engine manufacturer performed risk assessments and developed maintenance manual inspection schedules based on these assessments, including the fly-on allowance under which the engine in this incident was released ("The engine manufacturer performed mathematical risk assessments based on the regulator's requirements and developed the aircraft maintenance manual inspection schedules based on the mathematical results" (4.2.5)). However, the occurrence of the engine failure within the fly-on allowance period suggests that the risk analysis may need to be revisited to ensure it adequately accounts for the potential severity and likelihood of similar incidents.
- name: Crew Response and Training
  explanation: Crew response and training is a safety theme that focuses on the actions taken by flight and cabin crew during an emergency and their preparedness for such situations. In this incident, the crew's initial actions on becoming aware of the problem with the right engine on approach to Auckland were in accordance with the quick reference handbook checklist, and the captain made appropriate decisions under the circumstances ("The crew's initial actions on becoming aware of a problem with the right engine on approach to Auckland were in accordance with the quick reference handbook checklist" (4.5.2)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of crew training and the ability to respond effectively to in-flight emergencies.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Certification
  explanation: Regulatory oversight and certification is a safety theme that involves the standards and approvals set by aviation authorities to ensure aircraft safety. The engine's design, which contained damage to inside the engine after the bird strike, is a required feature for which the engine is certified ("The containment of damage to inside the engine is a required design feature for which the engine is certified" (4.2.3)). This theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the role of regulatory bodies in certifying aircraft components and the need for continuous evaluation of certification standards in light of new data and incidents.
