The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurren ces in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recomm endations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission ) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New  Zealand, and  
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and cause s of occurrences with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the fu ture.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transpor t sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

Report 10 -101 
<< Page 1 >>
 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 13 August 2010 a scheduled  Auckland passenger train  ('the passenger train')  with about 
100 people on board travelled  from Papakura to Britomart Station in central Auckland via 
Westfield and Tamaki Stations .  An unscheduled shunt was signalled to follow  the passenger 
train  from Westfield as far as Tamaki , so that it could  enter a rail siding.  
1.2. There was a miscommunication when details of the shunt  were passed from the Otahuhu to 
the Auckland signal box controller and as a result the Auckland signal box controller confused 
the running order of the 2 trains.  Not realising that the shunt was behind  the passenger train , 
he set the route at Tamaki to divert the shunt to the opposite Down Main line in preparation 
for ent ering the rail siding from there.  This wrong route setting for the passenger train  was the 
first of a set of 4 related incidents.  
1.3. A worksite  had been set up within the Tamaki Station limits to enable work to be undertaken  
by the work gang .  The Tamaki Station limits were a short distance from Panmure Station.  The 
passenger train was supposed to stop at Panmure Station then continue through the worksite  
along the usual Up Main line.  The driver of the passenger train was not aw are that the route 
had been incorrectly set to divert his train to the Down Main line. His train had passed a yellow 
signal before Panmure, which told him that the next signal around the corner and out of sight 
from within Panmure Station was not displayin g green.  Instead the next signal was a 'low 
speed ' signal , advising the driver that the points were set to divert his train to the Down Main 
line and that his train was to be travelling at no more than 25 kilometres per hour  (km/h) . 
1.4. The passenger train st opped and exchanged passengers at Panmure.  The train was running 
behind schedule owing  to several small delays.  Before departing  from  Panmure Station the 
driver called the work gang and asked for permission to pass through the worksite.  He was 
granted p ermission to pass through 'at normal speed '.  The person in the work gang who 
responded  had noticed that Points No.15 at Tamaki had moved to set the route for the next 
train across to the  Down Main line, but did not mention this to the driver o f the passenger 
train . 
1.5. Keen to make up lost time on the schedule, the driver accelerated the passenger  train away 
from Panmure Station with the intention of reaching full speed.  He appeared to have  
forgotten that the previous signal had been yellow and was not expecting the next signal to be 
a low -speed signal .  His train rounded the bend , where he eventually noticed the next signal.  
Despite braking his train heavily , it went through the low-speed cross -over to the Down Main 
line at nearly twice the m aximum speed limit  of 25 k m/h.  This was the second  incident.  
1.6. The passenger  train reacted violently as it went through the cross -over to the other line, but 
did not roll over or derail.  None of the people on board was injured, but some were shaken by 
the violent movement of the train.  
1.7. One of the track workers was walking beside the Down Main line at the time , with his back to 
the approaching  passenger train.  As the driver was bringing his train to a stop, it narrowly 
avoided striking the track worker.  T his was the third  incident.  
1.8. The driver of the passenger train was also shaken by this experience , but after a short pause  
he decided that the signal box controller's intention must have been to re -route his train to the 
Up Main line farther down the track,  so without speaking with the signal box controller or with 
train control, he moved his train along the Down Main line towards the next set of points.  He 
was not looking at the signals, but instead was looking at the railway line ahead to check that 
the p oints were set to take his train across to the Up Main line.  When he saw that they were 
not, he stopped his train, but not before he had passed a red signal that required him to stop .  
This was the fourth  incident.  
1.9. The Transport Accident Investi gation Commission's  (the Commission's)  findings  included that 
the wrong route for the passenger train  had been  set through a combination of poor 
communication and failure to adhere to standard procedures when switching Tamaki Station 
to manual control .  If the driver had driven his train to the signals , the wrong route setting 
should not have created any danger to his train and its occupants, but systems that had been 
put in place to help drivers remember previous signal s were not well designed for the task  and 
 

<< Page 2 >>
 Report 10 -101 not routinely used by train drivers.  Opportunities for correcting or preventing all 4 of these 
incidents were  lost through substandard levels of crew resource management (CRM) that 
should have had all of the rail participants working as a team to man age safe railway 
operations.  
1.10.  A lack of clarity in the daily work bulletin issued to all rail participants and the failure to follow 
standard procedures when switching the Tamaki Station signal box to manual contributed to 
the signal box controllers being  unaware that a compulsory -stop-protected worksite  existed 
within  the Tamaki Station limits.  
1.11.  A number of safety actions  were taken  by KiwiRail to address immediate safety issues around 
communication, and as part of the upgrade to the Auckland rail networ k the signal boxes 
involved with this incident have been decommissioned and incorporated into the Wellington 
National Train Control  Centre.  These safety actions have superseded the  need for other safety  
recommendations . 
1.12.  The Commission is making recommenda tions  to the Chief Executive of the New Zealand 
Transport Agency to address safety issues concerning : systems to help train drivers remember 
the status of signals their train s have already passed when having to deal with the distraction 
of stopping at inte rvening stations ; and the clarity of daily work bulletins disseminating 
important operating information to rail personnel . 
1.13.  The key lessons  from the inquiry into this occurrence were:  
 safe rail operations are reliant upon good communication between all 
oper ating personnel  
 all individuals and groups of individuals working in the rail industry need to 
understand  fully and be working to a common objective before safe rail 
operations can be achieved  
 documents created for the purpose of providing essential inform ation to rail 
participants should be clear, unambiguous and in a format suitable for the 
intended recipients.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. This set of incidents occurred on 13 August 2010 and was verbally notified to the Commission 
on the same day. After makin g preliminary enquiries, t he Commission opened  an inquiry on 18 
August 2010.  
2.2. Two Commission  investigators visited the site , then interviewed witnesses around Auckland 
over 3 days from 24 August 2010.  After  a preliminary analysis, further interviews were 
arranged  in Auckland  for 2 days from 2 November 2010.   
2.3. Evidence  was gathered from various sources including train control telephone and radio audio 
recordings, the passenger train 's Tranzlog data recorder files, train control system record s, 
train register system files, industry operating rules, signal ling and interlocking diagrams, 
photographs, equipment manuals, personnel records, staff medical records, Veolia and 
KiwiRail  operational guides and records and  Auckland metro railway CCTV (closed -circuit 
telev ision) files.   
2.4. An external specialist in human factors was engaged to review the human factor aspects of 
the incidents . 
2.5. Once  the preliminary key issues had been identified , Commission investigators met with 
KiwiRail and Veolia operational managers , and re presentatives from the NZ Transport Agency , 
on 16 March 2011 . This was to inform the m of  the facts of the incidents determined by the 
Commission so far , to explain the Commission's  process for consulting on its draft final report  
and to discuss  potential recommendations  arising from the Commission's inquiry .  
2.6. The draft final report was submitted  for the Commissioners ' consideration at the May 2011 
Commission meeting. The Commission approved the draft final report for circulation to 
interested persons  for co mment on 22 February 2012.  
2.7. Comments were sought from 17 interested persons on 11 May 2012 and received from 3. 
These submissions were considered and a number of changes made. On  29 August 2012  the 
Commission approved a revised draft final report to be circ ulated to 2 interested persons for 
further comment.  The final report was approved for publication with minor revis ions by the 
Commission on 24 October 2012

 Report 10 -101 3. Factual information  
3.1. Introduction  
Overview of t he incidents  
3.1.1.  An Auckland metro  passenger train wi th about 100 people on board was on a scheduled trip 
from Papakura to Britomart Station in central Auckland  along the Eastern Line via Glen Innes 
(see Figure 1). An unscheduled shunt , which had been holding at Westfield,  was signa lled by 
the Otahuhu signal box controller to follow the passenger train to Tamaki. The Otahuhu signal 
box controller then phoned  through  the shunt's  details to the Auckland signal box controller to 
set a route for it through to Tamaki.  
3.1.2.  The Auckland signal box controller believed the shunt  was the only rail vehicle  between 
Westfield and Tamaki , so immediately set a route for it to cross to the Down Main line at 
Tamaki. The passenger train arrived at Tamaki first and therefore encountered a wrong route 
that h ad been set for the shunt .  The driver of the  passenger train  did not respond to a signal 
in time to avoid taking  the wrong route  through an 'S'-shaped turnout at well above  the speed 
limit, nearly hit ting a track worker before  finally  stopping  beyond a si gnal at stop.   
3.1.3.  Passing a signal at stop is termed a SPAD (signal passed at danger) , which  is regarded  as a 
serious incident  and initiates  a formal investigation and reporting process.  
Background information  
3.1.4.  The Auckland metro rail network is used by sche duled commuter rail and both scheduled and 
unscheduled freight operations. This type of unscheduled  shunt  movement was a familiar 
action for the signal box controllers and occurred  about 3 to 5 times per weekday. The last 
movement had been  completed less t han 2 hours before this incident.  
3.1.5.  On the day of the occurrence, track maintenance work was being carried out  by the work gang  
on the Up Main line within  the Tamaki Station limits . Entry to the worksite  was controlled by a 
compulsory stop board placed at  the north end of the Panmure Station platform. All trains on 
the Up Main line were required to stop at this point and seek permission from the person -in-
charge  of the worksite  before they could proceed beyond the compulsory stop board .  
3.1.6.  A 'wrong route se tting' is where a train is presented with a signal aspect that is not intended 
for it. The normal expected response  in accordance with the Rules1 is that the train driver 
would recognise that the signal aspect was not intended for that train, the train would be  
stopped and the driver would contact  the local train controller to resolve the situation . The 
train control staff interviewed estimated that wrong route setting s occurred in the Tamaki area 
about one or 2 times per month  and they were usually resol ved as described . This incident 
was an exception.

 Report 10 -101 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On 13 August 2010 , Train 2238 , a scheduled diesel multiple unit ( DMU ) passenger train  (the 
'passenger train ') was travelling on the Up Main line from Papakura to Britomart via Westfield, 
Sylvia Park and Glen Innes. It departed from Papakura at 1250 and was due to depart from 
Westfield at 1318.  
3.2.2.  An unscheduled shunt locomotive , Shunt L9, (the 'shunt')  was at Westfield yards waiting to  
follow the pass enger train  to Tamaki . At Tamaki , the shunt  would then be routed to the Down 
Main line so that it could be  set back to enter a siding near Panmure Station called the 
Carbine Road  Siding.   
3.2.3.  See the timeline ( Appendix 4) and the annotated track layout drawing  (Figure 4) for a visual 
presentation of these event sequences.  
3.2.4.  Tamaki Station had been 'switched  in'2 before 1319 in order to provide blocking for the work  
gang.  
3.2.5.  The passenger train  was delayed for 1.5 minutes at Westfield while a fitter repaired the 
windscreen wiper for the driver .  It then  departed from Westfield at 1320 . The shunt  departed 
from Westfield at 1321 and followed  as close ly as the automatic signals would allow. At Sylvia 
Park the shunt  was within lin e of sight of the passenger train .  
3.2.6.  The Otahuhu signal box controller had sought approval from the train controller for the shunt  
movement and manually entered a scheduled departure time of 1320 for it into his train 
register on the Otahuhu tab. When it ha d departed at 1321 he updated his train register and 
advised the Auckland signal box controller by phone  by saying  "Following the subby3, L9, light 
engine, Tamaki".  This abbreviated  verbal message was meant to convey that the shunt  was to 
be signalled to f ollow the passenger train  as far as Tamaki. The Otahuhu signal box controller 
did not include the departure time for the shunt  or the  train reference number  of the  
passenger train . The signalling and safe working rules4 required the train running order to be 
advised to the next signal box controller , but did not define how it was to be described.   
3.2.7.  The Auckland signal box controller estimated an arrival time for the shunt  at Tamaki , then 
manually entered its details into his train register on the Auckland ta b. A realistic estimate 
would have been about 9 minutes, including station stops, but the Auckland signal box 
controller allowed only 4 minutes ' running time from Westfield to Tamaki with an  estimated  
arrival at Tamaki of 1325 . He also  incorrectly  entered the movement  as a 'departing ' event for 
the shunt  at Tamaki , when it sh ould have been entered as an 'arrival ' event .  
3.2.8.  Immediately after the Auckland signal box controller entered the details on his train register, 
he set a route for the shunt  to cross to t he Down Main line at Tamaki .  This included switching 
Points No.15 from normal to reverse and Signal 16AC to 'low speed ' (red over a short -range , 
low-speed yellow light) . Intermediate Signal 67024 automatically followed the status of Signal 
16AC and change d from 'clear -proceed'  (green)  to 'caution'  (yellow) .  
3.2.9.  At about the same time, the Auckland signal box controller phoned the train controller to seek 
permission to send the shunt  directly back to the Carbine Road  Siding from the Tamaki Down 
Main line rathe r than park it on the siding  that was occupied by the work  gang .  The train 
controller approved this .   
3.2.10.  Meanwhile the passenger train  stopped at Sylvia Park Station , where 12 wheelchair -bound  
passengers and their minders were waiting to board. The wh eelchair pick -up had been 
prearranged through the Veolia customer services supervisor.  The train manager on board the 
passenger train  had been advised and he had informed his crew and the driver  to be  prepared 
for a delay at Sylvia Park.  Normally a stati on stop would be about 30 to 40 seconds , but the 
stop that day took 5.6 minutes.  
                                                        
2 Switching in the station is to switch the signals and points to manual control.  
3 'Subby ' was a local colloquial name for a suburban passenger train , as commonly used by the Auckland area signal box controllers.

 3.2.11.  Auckland Transport measure s Veolia's on -time train performance at 3 - and 5 -minute windows 
around the scheduled times.   The signalling and safe working rules expect scheduled t rains to 
be running within 5 -minute windows. Veolia provided a worksheet5 schedule to drivers for 
them to compare actual running times with the schedule at 'timed stops ' along the ir route s. 
The timed stops along this section of track for the passenger trai n were the departure from 
Otahuhu - 1316, the departure from Glen Innes - 1328 , and the arrival at Britomart - 1342. 
The passenger train  was 6.5 minutes behind schedule when  it departed from Sylvia Park . The 
driver had not advised the train controller or a  signal box controller of the delay to his service .  
He said later  that he was attempting to make up time before reaching Britomart.  
3.2.12.  The Auckland signal box controller was preparing to hand over his panel to the Newmarket 
signal box controller , who would t hen merge it with his own and control both from the 
Newmarket desk .  The Auckland signal box controller  had expected the shunt  to be at Tamaki 
by this time , but it had not shown up on the mimic  display , so he rang the Otahuhu signal box 
controller to confi rm the departure time. This was confirmed and they discussed possible 
reasons for  the delay to the shunt .  The Auckland signal box controller then concluded that it 
had been delayed by a compulsory -stop-protected worksite , when in fact it had been delayed 
behind the late -running passenger train . 
3.2.13.  As the passenger train  approached Panmure, t he driver sounded the horn at  the inner warning 
board for the compulsory -stop-protected  work area as required . He recalled seeing  the 
Intermediate Signal 67024 displaying a 'caution ' signal .  
3.2.14.  The train stopped at Panmure Station  for 70 seconds , increasing the total  running time to an 
estimated 7 minutes  behind schedule . The driver called the person -in-charge  of the worksite  
on the radio for clearance to pass his compulsory stop board. The No.2 person -in-charge  
approved this request with the phrase, "Proceed through my worksite  at normal speed" . The 
driver read back the clearance . 
3.2.15.  At about the same time , the Auckland signal box controller handed over his panel to the 
Newmar ket controller and left the signal box to catch a train to Otahuhu , where he was to 
complete his shift  relieving in the Otahuhu signal box.  The handover between signal box 
controllers was completed just as a train was seen on their mimic  displays  going th rough 
Points No.15 at Tamaki.   They both thought that it was the shunt , when in fact it was the 
passenger train .

 Report 10 -101 3.2.16.  The passenger train  had left Panmure Station and accelerated under full throttle towards the 
normal 90 km/h speed limit for the line . The dista nce between the compulsory stop board at 
Panmure platform and Signal 16AC was approximately 500 m etres (m)  and the track was on a 
gentle  climbing gradient with a left -hand curve. Signal 16AC was placed high above the centre 
of the 2 tracks on a gantry and visible from at least 200 m ( see Figure 2). The work  gang was 
clear of the track , standing to the right -hand side of the driver near the eastern buttress of the 
Morrin Road overbridge.  
3.2.17.  When the work  gang came in to the driver's view , he sounded the horn .  He  recalled  that he 
received what he thought was a hand movement  in response  from the work  gang .  At about 
this time the driver noticed that Signal 16AC was showing a 'low speed ' signal , which me ant 
that his train should have been travelling at no more than 25 km/h  at the signal and he 
should have been prepared to stop before any obstruction .  This would have appeared as a 
red light on the top 3 -colour indicator. It meant  that Points No.15 was set  to direct his train 
from the Up Main line to the adjacent Down Main line. The driver had been  expecting to see a 
green light , and although he reacted quickly and braked hard , the train entered the turnout at 
between 40  km/h and 55 km/h.  
3.2.18.  The train swayed abnormally as it passed through the 'S'-shaped cross -over line but remained 
on the rails. The passengers were shaken and rolled about  but no -one reported injuries. 
Witness accounts indicated that the train rolled on the bogies and lifted an unusual amount 
on the suspension at the centre of the train , where the 2 cars were coupled .  A loud hiss of 
escaping air was also heard from both inside and outside the train.  The train and the track 
were undamaged by the incident.  
3.2.19.  The driver slowed the train to a halt j ust past Signal 12A. The train had travelled an estimated 
115 m in 9.5 seconds from Signal 16AC to where it stopped.  
3.2.20.  The person -in-charge  of the worksite  had been walking north near the Down Main line towards 
his parked vehicle . He was using a protection m ethod called individual train detection (ITD)6. 
This was a standard method of protection during a track occupation , where the person was 
individually responsible for their  own lookout and for their  safe clearance from moving  rail 
vehicles.  
3.2.21.  The person -in-charge  was facing  the direction  from which  trains normally came on the Down 
Main line when the passenger train  approached him from behind , passed  close by and 
stopped just in front of him.   He had not heard the train approaching nor was he aware that it 
was approaching from behind him.  
3.2.22.  It was unusual for a passenger train to be routed to the Down Main line at Tamaki. The driver 
said that he was expecting to  be redirected to the Up Main line at the north end  of Tamaki 
Station  so, having  remained stationary f or about 20 seconds , he moved the train slowly 
towards the north end of the Tamaki Station  limits  at approximately 30 km/h .  The driver said 
that when he realised that the north -end Points No.3 were not set to route his train to the Up 
Main line, he braked  his train but it stopped  a few metres past the ground Signal 8B , which 
was at stop.  This constituted a SPAD incident at Signal 8B (Figure 3).  
3.2.23.  The driver then made a base -call7 on the radio to train control and described  his situation as 
having been wrong  routed to the Down Main line at Tamaki.  
3.2.24.  The train controller replied  that he thought the train was the wrong train in the wrong place 
and asked the driver to hold where he was. The train controller contacted the Newmarket  
signal box controller by phone t o advise him of the wrong routing .  Once the SPAD at Signal 8B 
was realised, the driver of the passenger train  was relieved  of his duties . 
  
                                                        
6 The i ndividual train detection track occupation method is described in the Rail Operating Rules and Procedures , Section 9 - Track 
Safety Rules, Rule 917 . 
7 Base -call is a single -button feature of the radio that sends a coded signal on the selected channel. Recipients with the matched 
receiving equipment hear a ringing tone and the train vehicle identification number is displayed.

3.3. Description of the track and signals at Tamaki  
3.3.1.  An extract from t he Tamaki track signal ling and interlocking diag ram is shown in Figure 4 and 
the full diagram is provided in A ppendix 1 for a more detailed view of the track through Tamaki 
Station . 
3.3.2.  The rail track between Otahuhu and Britomart via Tamaki is a double line , with the left -hand 
track facing north dedicated to travel towards Britomart ( the Up Main line) and the other for 
traffic travelling away from Britomart ( the Down Main  line).  
3.3.3.  The signals were controlled automatically under a control system  described in the Double Line 
Automatic  Signalling Regulations. The control system detected the presence of a train on the 
track and automatically changed the signals to maintain a safe distance between consecutive 
trains.  
3.3.4.  Tamaki was a decommissioned passenger station and only used for shunt m ovements. 
Normally passenger rail traffic would pass straight through the Tamaki Station  limits in 
accordance with the automatic signalling, without slowing or stopping. The  station would 
normally be in automatic ( 'switched out ') mode .  When rail movements  were required within 
the Tamaki Station  limits, such as the shunt , the Auckland signal box controller  would take 
manual control of Tamaki (switch  in) and make the required control changes . The station 
controls could be switched between automatic and manua l by clicking on a button on the 
mimic  display .  
3.3.5.  Within  the Tamaki Station  limits there was one siding and 2 back -shunt stub tracks to assist 
with shunting movements. Most of t he up and Down Main line sections  within  the Tamaki 
Station  limits were designat ed bi -directional.

3.4. Train control in the area 
3.4.1.  Train operations within the Auckland metro area were controlled by the Auckland train 
controller located in the Wellington National Train Control Centre. The operation of some high-
activity zones within th e area was delegated to local signal box controllers  (see the shaded 
signal box control zones in  Figure 1), but the train controller still retained overall responsibility 
for train movements through those zones . The signal box con troller s provided a local interface 
with train drivers , but still required approval from train control before dispatching movements 
from a station or terminal other than scheduled passenger movements.   
3.4.2.  The Otahuhu signal box managed local traffic passing t hrough Otahuhu and Westfield Station s 
and the southern Auckland rail junctions to Southdown, Penrose and Tamaki. It also controlled 
the entry of all locomotives and passenger trains from the Westfield maintenance facility  to 
the controlled network.  
3.4.3.  The Auckland signal box managed  the entry/exit of trains at Britomart Station  and Tamaki 
Station .  
The train register  
3.4.4.  The signal box controllers used a networked computer display ( called the 'train register '; see 
Figure 5) to record train mo vements  within their respective control zone s. The train controller 
in Wellington used the information entered by the signal box controllers to plot actual rail 
movements against scheduled times on a train control diagram. The Auckland signal box 
controlle r's train register display was similar to the example  from Otahuhu shown in Figure 5.  
3.4.5.  The train register was pre-programmed with the published train timetable , but unscheduled 
services had to be entered manually at the time  by th e respective signal box controllers. Any 
person with access to the  networked system could look at displays for other location s, but 
company policy was that signal box controllers  were only able to enter data for  their own 
location s. Train movements were au tomatically sorted on the train register display by the time 
for an event at the location . The user display  was usually scrolled to display a window , with the 
current time near the top of the page and future times towards  the bottom.  
3.4.6.  Tamaki was not set up  with its own location display page , so standard practice was for the 
Auckland signal box controller to use the single Auckland display  to log movements at both 
Tamaki and Britomart Stations . Tamaki movements would be separated from Britomart events 
by abo ut 12 minutes ' running time , and the signal box controller would add note s in the 
comments column  of the Tamaki movements to note that they were not travelling the full line 
distance to Britomart .

 The train control mimic display  
3.4.7.  The Eastern Line , whic h runs between Westfield and Britomart via Tamaki, was usually 
controlled automatically , but the signal box control zones (as shown in Figure 1) could be 
manually controlled. The Wellington -based train controller and the Auckland signal box 
controller each had a mimic display that represented  Tamaki Station  (shown as one of the 
blue zones in Figure 1) to enable them to control the zone  remotely . The rest of the Eastern 
Line was not represented on a mimic  display for either controller.   
3.4.8.  The mimic display show ed the real-life status of points and signals and approximate train 
locations. The top horizontal line of the Tamaki mimic display ( Figure 6) represents the Up 
Main line going f rom Westfield (left) to Britomart (right). The Down Main line going away from 
Britomart is the centre line and the Tamaki siding is the bottom line. The status of all points 
within station limits is shown by the yellow directional status lines , with the id entifying 
number s adjacent and letter s identifying the normal (N) and reverse (R) positions . Signals are 
represented by the signal identification number s and coloured symbol s for the current status. 
The track segment is red when it is occupied by a train , but the length of the red segment is 
not relative to train length.  
 
Figure 6  
Tamaki mimic display  
 
3.4.9.  The status of the Tamaki mimic display shown in Figure 6 was the actual  display after the 
passenger train  had set back to clear Points No.3 on  the day of this incident  and after the 
SPAD . The shunt  is the red line before Signal 16AC (labelled as 16) and the passenger train  is 
within station limits on the Down Main line but clear of Signal 8B. A passenger train that was 
travelling from right to left is shown stopped before Signal 4 on the Down Main line. The points  
were  in the normal position of straight through on the up and Down Main lines. The button at 
the bottom is the controller's Tamaki Stat ion manual/ automatic  cursor control button shown 
in the manual control  state ( if the button was pressed the station would switch to auto).  
3.5. Track work at Tamaki  
3.5.1.  On the day of this incident, a  three -man track maintenance gang  (the 'work gang') was 
working  within the Tamaki Station area , replacing an insulated track circuit joint on the Up 
Main line near Forster's Siding (see Figure 4).      
3.5.2.  Industry safety rules required that track occupants use an approved  form of track occupation 
protection to ensure their protection  from harm by rail vehicles.  The protection method 
selected by the person -in-charge  was 'compulsory stop protection ' on the Up Main line only, as 
defined by Rule 905 in the rail operating rules8 (see Appendix 2 ).  
3.5.3.  This could only be applied to a single track in a double -track area where the separation 
distance from all work personnel and t he work area was greater than 4  m to the  centre of the 
                                                        
8 KiwiRail Rail Operating  Rules and Procedures, Section 9  - Track Safety Rules, Rule 905 . 

 

<< Page 14 >>
 Report 10 -101 adjacent track.  If this separation could not be assured, both tracks had to be protected . The 
required separation distance was met at the planned work area .  
3.5.4.  Compulsory stop protection is a planned track occupation between stated times. Signs are 
placed at specific distances from the work area in the direction from which  trains would be 
travelling as they approach the work area , and standard actions are required as instructed by 
these signs.  
3.5.5.  The compulsory stop board  was placed  at the end of the Panmure Station platform , where a 
driver could see it during passenger operations and seek clearance before moving away from 
the platform.  
3.5.6.  The compulsory -stop-protected  work area for this site was approved then  advise d to the 
industry via an official b ulletin (see Appendix 3) conta ining a standard set of information. It 
stated : the type of protection applied;  that it applied to the Up Main line only;  the metrage 
limits  of the protected work area ; the nearest stations on both sides of the p rotected work 
area;  the ti me and date of the  planned work;  the general type of work being carried out ; and 
the contact details for the person -in-charge . The b ulletin did not mention that the work was 
within  the Tamaki Station  limits . KiwiRail said that it was not its "policy at the time to mention 
that the protected work area included station limits at a given location".   
3.5.7.  The driver of the passenger train , the 2 signal box controllers , the train controller  and the 
person -in-charge  of the work gang had copies of the daily bulletin with them or in thei r 
workplace s and were required under their respective operating licences to familiarise 
themselves with current bulletins  at the start of each working shift.  
3.5.8.  On the day, the work  gang completed its planned work earlier than the approved track 
occupa tion period of 0900 to 1500 , and the person -in-charge  decided to use the remaining 
time for a small , unplanned job to replace some loose bolts at the rail crossing near  Points 
No.15 A.  
3.5.9.  The full conditions for use of Rule 905 compulsory stop protect ion could not be met at the 
new work are a because  Points No.15 A were  less than 4  m from  the adjacent track  and the 
Down Main line would have been obstructed . 
3.5.10.  The person -in-charge  did not request protection on the Down Main line. Instead he decided to 
add a protect ion system to manage the risk from the less than 4  m of track separation . He 
supplement ed the compulsory -stop-protected work area  with a protection method called 
Individual Train Detection and used an observer.  
3.5.11.  The person -in-charge  and his No.2  evaluat ed the job then decided they needed  additional 
equipment and material from the vehicle before they started work . The person -in-charge  
wanted to bring his vehicle  closer to the secondary work area , so he requested 'foul time'9 
protection from the Auckland s ignal box controller to apply to the Tamaki siding so he could 
park his vehicle on the siding . Three  minutes after this conversation the controller switched 
Points No.15 to reverse  for what he thought would be the shunt .  The work  gang was standing 
beside the points and saw them  move.  
3.5.12.  The person -in-charge  handed control of his compulsory -stop-protected secondary work area 
and the radio to  his No.2 person -in-charge  and proceeded to walk along the Down Main line 
towards his vehicle , which  was parked wit hin the Tamaki Station  limits  but clear of the tracks . 
The No.2 person -in-charge  and the observer stood clear of the Down Main line near the Morrin 
Road overbridge, ready to control rail traffic through the work area . They were there when t he 
driver of the passenger train  called  to gain clearance to enter the compulsory -stop-protected  
site.

 3.6. Other parties present  
3.6.1.  The passenger train  was crewed by a driver, one train manager and 3 passenger operators 
and had  approximately 100 passengers on board.   
3.6.2.  The shun t was crewed by a driver and his assisting rail operator.  
3.6.3.  The work  gang had one person -in-charge , the No.2 person -in-charge  and an observer . A 
separate emergency protection person was located near the compulsory stop board at 
Panmure Station  in case a train failed to stop at it . 
3.6.4.  The Auckland signal box was manned by one signal box controller. This person was near a task 
change that required him to relocate to the Otahuhu signal box. Owing  to the low workload at 
the time,  he was able to hand  contr ol of the Auckland panel to the Newmarket signal box 
controller (in the adjacent room) for the last 30 minutes of his duty time on the Auckland 
panel . The Newmarket signal box controller was in control of the Auckland signal box when the 
passenger train  passed through Points No.15.  
3.6.5.  The Auckland desk in the National Train Control Centre at Wellington was manned by one train 
controller . The network control manager  at the Centre had overall responsibility for national 
rail movements conducted by all of the regional train controllers  at the Centre . 
3.7. Description of the passenger t rain (Train 2238)  
3.7.1.  The passenger train  was a 2 -car DMU  set. The trailer car ADC 855 was leading with the driver 
in the cab. The motor car ADL 805 was trailing.  
3.7.2.  The motor car had two 220-kilowatt under -slung diesel traction motors linked to the final drive 
units in the bogies through  hydraulic transmission units.  The trailer car had a single under -
slung diesel engine and alternator set to provide electrical power for both cars.  
3.8. Personnel information  
3.8.1.  The driver of the passenger train  had recently gained his operating licence  and had about 6 
months ' experience as a qualified driver .  His on-the-job training phase had been interrupted 
owing  to events outside work , but the refresher training car ried out by Veolia after each break 
Figure 7

<< Page 16 >>
 Report 10 -101 brought him back to the same stage before he continued  on-the-job training . He had passed 
all pre -licence tests and post -licence observations to date .  
3.8.2.  His allocated work  shift in the previous  2 weeks  had gene rally started between 0830 and 
1300 , with two 0600 starts.  
3.8.3.  The driver was considered to be medically fit for normal duties by the Veolia medical assessor 
at the time of this incident.  The Rail Operating Rules and Procedures place t he responsibility 
for daily assessment s of fitness for duty on the respective operational staff10, but the rules 
also require  all rail personnel who have concerns  about the fitness for duty of other rail 
personnel to report the matter s to their manager s. Managers and supervisors are expected to 
stand down rail personnel when they have concerns  about their  current fitness for duty.  The 
driver considered that he was fit for work when he reported for duty on the day of this incident  
and no -one else had reporte d any concern s at the time .  
3.8.4.  The post -incident medical assessment of the driver conducted by his employer revealed that 
he had been undergoing long -term treatment for a condition at the time but that the condition 
had been  under control and was not relevan t to this incident. It also revealed that he had 
recently been experiencing overt stress symptoms , such as problems sleeping, headaches and 
exhaustion  brought on predominantly by non -work issues . On the day prior to the incident he 
had not experienced any problems , but o n the day of the incident he had  had a headache  that 
he self -medicated with Panadol.  
3.8.5.  The driver had started work at Westfield yard then travelled as a passenger into Britomart to 
collect his first train for the day. H is first job was from Britomart to Papakura , where he had a 
short break before driving the passenger train  from there back to Britomart. It was on this 
second trip that these incidents  occurred.  
3.8.6.  The Auckland signal box controller had had about 2 years' exp erience since gaining his 
operating certificate and was familiar with both the Auckland and Otahuhu signal box 
operation s. He said that he  had felt rested and fit for duty that day.  
3.8.7.  The Otahuhu signal box controller was a senior member of the team with more than  7 years' 
experience  as a signal box controller. At the time he was acting team leader. He said that he 
had felt reasonably rested and fit for duty that day.   
3.8.8.  The person -in-charge  of the work  gang and his No.2 each  had more than  25 years of ra il 
experience. The person -in-charge  had a current licence  to operate category J  (multi -worksite)  
for which he had completed a refresher course 11 days beforehand , and his most recent 
safety observation had been carried out in January 2009 .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Intro duction  
4.1.1.  This report covers 4 separate but connected incidents that occurred at Tamaki:   
 a wrong route was set by the Auckland signal box controller  for the 
passenger train  
 the driver of the passenger train  respond ed to the 'low speed ' signal  
too late and h is train followed the wrong route from the Up Main line 
to the Down Main line at a dangerously high speed  
 the driver of the passenger train  made a wrong assumption that his 
train would be re -routed from the Down Main line to the Up Main line 
and passed  a red signal at stop (SPAD) by several metres  
 a track worker was not actively looking in both directions  for trains 
while walking near the track , so narrowly avoid ed being  hit by the 
passenger train  after it had taken the wrong route . 
Ineffective communicatio n was a factor common to all 4 incidents.   
4.2. The wrong route setting  
4.2.1.  The Auckland signal box controller set a wrong route for the passenger train  because he 
misunderstood  the correct running order of the trains adjacent to the shunt.  
4.2.2.  When an unscheduled serv ice like the shunt was to be signalled on  to the controlled network 
at Westfield bound for Tamaki, there was a standard procedure that should have been 
followed. The driver of the unscheduled shunt w ould contact the Otahuhu signal box controller 
and reques t clearance for the trip to  the Carbine Road Siding. The signal box controller would 
seek approval from the train controller for the movement , then set the signals for the shunt to 
depart from the Westfield yards at the approved time and conditions.  The p rocedure was 
followed correctly up to this point.  
4.2.3.  The Auckland signal box controller needed to take manual control of the Tamaki signal box. He 
needed to know the correct order of the trains arriving at Tamaki and what worksite  activity 
was occurring within the signal box control zone . 
4.2.4.  When the shunt entered  the main line at Otahuhu bound for the Carbine Road Siding via 
Tamaki, this information needed to be passed to the Auckland signal box controller.  In this 
case the Auckland signal box c ontroller had already taken manual control of Tamaki because 
he had earlier had to arrange blocking protection for the work gang, so the Otahuhu signal box 
controller was responsible for passing on this information to him.  
4.2.5.  The rail operating rule  (Rail Ope rating Rules and Procedures, Section L1.1, paragraph 1.3.3) 
said:  
When attended, it will be necessary to advise the adjacent Signalbox/Panel 
concerned of the running order of all trains, except suburban passenger services 
unless they are running 5 minutes or more late . 
4.2.6.  During interviews both signal box controllers and their manager said that this  procedure  was 
normally observed  by giving the planned or actual time the shunt entered the Up Main line and 
the train number for the passe nger train it was following.  This would have been an effective 
way to pass on the information.  It would have been better if the procedure  had simply said 
this.  However, the Otahuhu signal box controller did not follow that usual practice.  He did not 
give the departure time of the shunt from Westfield and did not even give its destination as 
the 'Carbine Road Siding '.  Nor did he give the train number of the passenger train it was 
following.  Instead he said the shunt was following the 'subby '.  The omission of this important 
information was the first of several communication failures that resulted in the wrong route 
being set for the passenger train.  
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Report 10 -101 4.2.7.  The Auckland signal box controller erroneously thought that the 'subby ' was another 
passenger tr ain that had already passed through Tamaki, so he thought the shunt was the 
next train to arrive at Tamaki and set the route for it to cross to the Down Main line. 
4.2.8.  Following this incident KiwiRail  issued a safety briefing to all signal box  contro llers (on 29 
September 2010 ). The safety briefing reinforced the correct communication protocol 
described in the Rail Operating Rules and Procedures for use over radios11 and instructed 
signal box co ntrollers to apply  the same princip les when using telephon es, which  the signal 
box controllers had used in this case.  
4.2.9.  The rail operating rules for radio communication required that all messages be acknowledged 
and that when instructions were  issued the instructions be read back and confirmed as 
correct by the sender.  Even if that process had been followed by the signal box controllers on 
the telephone , this would not have resolved this situation because the Auckland signal box 
controller would simply have repeated back the information given to him by the Otahu hu 
signal box controller : "Following the subby, L9, light engine, Tamaki" .  He would have been 
none the wiser for what that actually meant.  
4.2.10.  Under different circumstances, if Tamaki had not already been switched in for manual control 
when the shunt  left Westfield, the Auckland signal box controller should have contacted the 
train controller before doing so  in accordance with operating rules12.  The train controller 
should then have confirmed with the Auckland signal box controller the order of trains  arriving 
at Tamaki .  Had this happened it is highly likely that the Auckland signal box controller would 
have realised which passenger train the shunt was following.  The wrong routing would have 
been avoided.  
4.2.11.  However, there was a longstanding local proc edure that circumvented the  application of this 
rule for Tamaki signal box .  This local procedure removed the second  opportunity to establish 
the correct order of the trains.  It also removed an opportunity for the Auckland signal box 
controller to understand the situation  fully regarding worksite s within  the Tamaki Station 
limits.  
4.2.12.  KiwiRail said that t he reason for this local procedure for Tamaki was a management 
interpretation of a rule regarding 'attendance ' at a signal box  and the description of Tamaki as 
a 'switch out ' station . KiwiRail's belief was that, as the Auckland signal box controller was 
continual ly in attendance at the Britomart main control room and as that person was also 
responsible for Tamaki, the 'station switch in ' checking procedure did not apply. The rule had 
been revised in mid-2008 to prevent such a misinterpretation , but the local proce dure for 
Tamaki had remained in place.   
4.2.13.  The operating  function of a  signal box is conceptually the same whether it is called  a 'switch 
in' or 'switch out ' signal box : it facilitates manual control of the local area . Tamaki was termed 
a 'switch out ' signal box and its normal state was switched out to allow the signals to operate 
in automatic  mode . 'Switch in ' signal boxes were ones that had less than 24/7 attendance , so 
the rules were intended to cover th e situation where a signal box controller would arrive  and 
unlock the signal box then take over local signalling control for the area. Tamaki was not a 
physical signal box but the control mimic was displayed on the Auckland signal box control 
desk and operated from that desk when required.  Whatever the term a scribed to the type of 
signal box, the signals within that control zone are in either automatic (switched out) or 
manual (switched in) mode and to switch in the signal box is to take over manual control.  
Therefore the rule (see footnote 12) about taking ma nual control of a signal box should have 
applied  rather than the local procedure . 
4.2.14.  The control of Tamaki was transferred from the Auckland signal box controller to the train 
controller after this incident , removing any  future  likelihood of a recurrence  of this wrong route 
setting .

Report 10 -101 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.2.15.  If the Auckland signal box controller had been  in doubt  about the train running order , he could 
have positively identified the train in front of the shunt by any one of 4 methods : 
1. He could have asked the Otahuhu signal box controll er for the passenger t rain 
number . 
2. He could have switched display tabs from his normal train register display to the 
Otahuhu signal box tab and seen what train number had left from there ahead of the 
shunt . 
3. He could have asked the train controller . 
4. He coul d have deduced the correct running order from his own Auckland train register  
based upon his estimate of the departure time of the shunt from Westfield . 
The Auckland signal box controller did not use any of these options to identify which train was 
in fron t of the shunt . Instead he made an incorrect assumption that the 'subby ' was a train he 
had just logged as arriving at Britomart.  
4.2.16.  However, t he train register display was not user -friendly when it was used beyond its design 
purpose for movements at both Tam aki and Britomart , because trains were listed in the 
Auckland train register in the time order that they were arriving at or departing from Britomart.   
When the train register was also used to control movements at Tamaki it required the operator 
to interpr et the display  mentally to obtain the true running order.   For example , the shunt was 
terminating at Tamaki but had left Westfield immediately after the passenger train , so their 
apparent arrival times at Britomart would be in the reverse order. The passen ger train  would 
arrive  at Britomart  in about 21 minutes and appear at the bottom of the list , while the shunt's 
arrival at Tamaki  would be near the top in 9 minutes.  The only indicator  that the 2 trains were 
going to different destinations would be the Auckland signal box controller 's notes  in the 
comments column of his train register to identify that the shunt 's arrival time was actually for 
Tamaki rather than for Britomart .  
4.2.17.  The Auckland signal box controller made 2 errors when he entered the event for  the shunt into 
his train register for  its planned movement to Tamaki.   He entered the train  as a departing 
event from Tamaki rather than arriving and  he only allowed 4 minutes ' running time to 
Tamaki , when the normal duration was about 9 minutes.  These err ors individually were  minor , 
but they could have been  an indication that the Auckland signal box controller was not 
focused entirely on the task at hand  or that he was confused about which signal box control 
desk he was operating at the time . 
4.2.18.  The Auckland signal box controller said that he was rested but his shift pattern for the period 
immediately preceding this incident had been  different from  his normal patterns. He was 
normally based at Otahuhu but in the previous few days he had been at Auckland (2 sep arate 
signal boxes) for one day, Otahuhu for 2 days, then 2 days on a relief shift from 1000 to 1810 
at all 3 signal boxes.  
4.2.19.  The duties  in a normal shift would be to operate a single control desk for the whole 8 -hour 
shift. The relief shift was intended to cover meal breaks for signal box controllers and 
consisted of multiple short stints (less than 2 hours each) at different signal boxes around 
Auckland. A person working this shift would have to settle into each new location, operate the 
control desk for an  hour or so , then relocate to the next signal box to repeat the cycle. The fast 
cycle pattern of the relief shift duties demanded considerably more mental effort from a 
controller  and may have facilitated minor errors .  
4.2.20.  On the day of the incident the Auckl and signal box controller was just about to complete his 
fourth  separate stint in the 2 signal boxes based in the Britomart main control room in the 3.5 
hours he had been on duty. He then had to travel by train to Otahuhu for his last stint for the 
day.  
4.2.21.  The Auckland signal box controller said that the mental demands of the relief shift required  
him continually  to anticipate the next control desk he was to operate because he had to swap 
so often between them .  
 

<< Page 20 >>
 Report 10 -101 4.2.22.  When considering the poor information the Auckl and signal box controller received about the 
train running order, it is feasible that his frequent change between control desks  contributed 
to his losing awareness of what trains he wa s dealing with and in what order . 
The bulletin information was not clear  to all parties  
4.2.23.  Signal box controller s are required to  read the current daily information bulletin s at the start of 
their shift s.  The daily information bulletin issued on 13 August 2010 (see an extract from it in 
Appendix 3) lis ted 13 protected worksite s on the Auckland metro rail network that day.  Two of 
those sites were within the Auckland signal box controller's zone : one at Tamaki and one at 
Orakei.  The Auckland signal box controller said that, o n the day of this incident, he had read 
the daily bull etin but neither he nor the Otahuhu signal box controller were  aware of the 
compulsory -stop-protected work area on the Up Main line along the Eastern Line . 
4.2.24.  The Auckland signal box controller said that his reason for misunderstanding the bulletin was 
that i t did not describe the location in terms he used every day : signals, points and stations. 
He also acknowledged that he could have found this information if required. The stations 
either side of Tamaki were named , but even though the work area was within the Tamaki 
Station  limits, Tamaki was not named in the bulletin.   
4.2.25.  It is a safety issue if bulletins are sent out with important information that some recipients do 
not comprehend or disregard as being unimportant  to them . The format of s uch an important 
document should  be reviewed by KiwiRail  in consultation with the target audience  to ensure  
that it clearly conveys the appropriate information . The Commission has made a safety 
recommendation to the N ew Zealand  Transport Agency to address this safety issue.  
 
Findings  
The Auckland signal box controller set the wrong route for the passenger train  at 
Tamaki because he confused the running order of the trains and thought that the 
shunt was the next train to arrive at Tamaki . 
The first reason for the Auckland signa l box controller confus ing the order of trains 
arriving at Tamaki was that the Otahuhu signal box controller did not give him clear 
information on which passenger train the shunt was following.   
The proper rail operating procedure was for signal box contro llers to contact train 
control before taking manual control of signal box es in order to obtain important 
information such as the correct running order of approaching trains and any worksite  
activit ies within the signal box control zones .  The established p ractice of not doing 
this for the Tamaki signal box compromised the safety of rail operations.  
The Auckland signal box controller 's relief shift duties required him to switch between 
signal box desks or move to other location s 5 times within 4 hours, which  required 
him to adjust  mentally  to the signal box he was working while at times having to 
anticipate his task at the next signal box.  It is possible that this disruptive work 
pattern contributed to hi s losing awareness of the trains he was signalling  and 
consequently the order of trains arriving at Tamaki.  
The Auckland signal box controller would have been aware that there was a protected 
worksite  within the Tamaki signal box control zone if the correct operating rules  had 
been followed or he had thorough ly read the daily work bulletin before switching in the 
signal box.  However, the daily work bulletin should have made the fact  clearer by 
directly referring to Tamaki when describing the limits of the work area.  
 
 
 
Report 10 -101 
<< Page 21 >>
 4.3. Taking the wrong route  at high speed  
4.3.1.  The train took the wrong route  at high speed  because the driver did not observe and correctly 
respond to the signals in front of his train .  Signal 67024 before Panmure  displayed yellow, 
which meant the driver should  not have expect ed a green signal  around t he corner ahead 
after leaving Panmure.  On most occasions on the same route the driver would have had both 
signals  showing green; nevertheless , on this occasion Signal 67024 was yellow,  so the driver 
should have driven his train with the expectation that h e might have to stop at the next signal, 
or as in this case , had his train at a low speed for crossing to the Down Main line. 
4.3.2.  By coincidence, t he inner warning board for the compulsory -stop-protected work area was 
positioned  next to Signal 67024.   The driv er confirmed that he had seen the  yellow  caution 
signal .  He  said that he had associated the caution signal  on Signal 67024 with the  warning 
board  for the compulsory -stop-protected work area within Tamaki .  He had incorrectly 
concluded that the person  in charge was controlling the signals for access to his work area .  
4.3.3.  The track signal and worksite warning board were independent of each other:  the signal was 
controlling the train, and the warning board was warning of the worksite ahead.   The 
interpretation t hat the driver expressed was unique , so it was examined further. Several driver 
trainers at the Veolia train driving school and the company safety investigator were questioned 
about the relationship between these 2 signalling systems , and the driver traini ng syllabus 
and rail operating rules were reviewed.   Other drivers involved with the investigation were also 
questioned. None of the people spoken to had made the same interpretation  as the driver of 
the passenger train , and neither could it be inferred fr om the operating rules  or training 
syllabus . 
4.3.4.  A more logical or believable scenario was that the driver simply forgot that Signal 67024 was 
displaying a yellow signal  after he had  stopped to exchang e passengers at Panmure.  It is not 
uncommon for train drivers to forget they had pass ed a  caution signal .  For example  a driver 
may become distracted during an intervening passenger stop .  The experience of some drivers 
forgetting a caution signal  was one reason for installing a signal alert system  in the cabs.  
4.3.5.  The train was fitted with a signal alert system that was intended to help drivers remember 
when they passed an advance signal that warned that the next signal would not be green.  It is 
a driver -activated distance -measuring  device that pulses a light and sounds a buzzer as the 
train approaches the next signal and is intended to counteract any intervening distractions, 
such as stopping at a station.  
4.3.6.  Drivers were expected to  use the signal alert device s when passing signals displaying caution 
signal s, as Signal 67024  was on this day .  The signal alert button was not in common use by 
Veolia drivers and some drivers said they had adopted their own alternative methods  for 
rememb ering caution signal s. The driver of the passenger train  did not use the signal alert 
device  when he approached Panmure Station  and he said he used  no alternative system.  If 
the driver had used the signal alert system it would have reminded him about the n ext signal 
just after his train departed  Panmure.  
4.3.7.  One reason that Veolia gave for drivers not using the signal alert device  was that the sound of 
its alarm was so similar to several other in -cab alarms that drivers were reluctant to use it.   
Another reason  given was that o nce the driver pushed the button and the train ha d travelled a 
further 600 m, the alarm then sound ed for a full 6 second s with a  loud, piercing  warning  tone 
that could not  be cancelled by the driver. Trains approaching Britomart sometimes  travel led 
close behind other trains and could therefore frequently pass yellow signals.  If the signal alert 
system had been  always used at yellow signals it would soon have lost its effectiveness as an 
alert and become a nuisance distraction . 
4.3.8.  While the in tention of the signal alert system  to minimise signals being passed at danger  was 
a proactive measure designed to mitigate an identified risk, the fact that it has not been 
successful in operation means the issue will need to be revisited.  The Commission has made 
a safety recommendation to the New Zealand  Transport Agency to address this safety issue.  
4.3.9.  There were  2 other sources of distraction that could possibly have contributed to the driver 
forgetting or not realising  that the next signal ahead was no t green . They were  that the driver 
 

<< Page 22 >>
 Report 10 -101 was overly focused on making up the delay to his train running schedule, and the misleading 
instruction given by the  No.2 person -in-charge  at the worksite.  
4.3.10.  The stop at Sylvia Park was longer than normal at 5.6 minutes, al though the driver said that 
he had not noted how long it was. The driver stated in his interview that his train running  
behind time  was on his mind and he was intent upon making up time before arriving at 
Britomart if at all possible.  When questioned abou t this , he understood that catching up to his 
schedule would have been an impractical goal , but he considered that by minimising delays 
and taking advantage of the in -built slack in the timetable, he could reduce the total delay 
slightly by the time he rea ched Britomart.  
4.3.11.  It was the driver's responsibility to inform train control if his train was not running to 
schedule14, but he had not done so. The train controller and the Auckland signal box controller 
were not aware of the delay to the passenger train  and the next formal time check station was 
not until after Tamaki.  
4.3.12.  When the passenger train  was ready to depart from Panmure Station , the driver obtained 
clearance from the  No.2  person -in-charge  to proceed past his compulsory stop board , but the 
response wa s misleading and contrary to current procedure at the time. He gave a speed 
reference in his clearance to the driver by using the phrase 'normal speed ', which meant to a 
train driver the 'maximum allowable speed limit ' for the train and the track at that p oint.  The 
correct radio procedure at the time was not to indicate any speed unless the maximum speed  
was lower than normal speed.  
4.3.13.  Often trains are delayed at compulsory -stop-protected worksite s as the track workers move 
their people and equipment clear o f the track , so the driver may have expected to be delayed . 
However,  in this case the work  gang was clear of the track and waiting for the train. The 
incorrect phraseology used for the clearance was misleading , but the driver di d not challenge 
it at the time. It was also compatible with  the driver's intent  to make up time because it would 
have allowed him to pass  quickly  through the worksite .  
4.3.14.  At this point there w ere 2 opportunit ies for communications to change the outcome. The driver 
could have queried the perceived speed clearance . Secondly,  the No.2 person -in-charge  was 
not required to advise the driver about the reverse condition of the points , but had he 
mentioned it, the information  could have challenged the driver's min d-set that the next signal 
was green.  
4.3.15.  KiwiRail did not agree with the concept of the track worker giving information about the points 
position to the driver because it could lead to "unintended safety risks ".  By that KiwiRail 
meant that this advice could be seen as "overriding the importance of, and reliance on, the 
signalling system".  The Commission does not agree.  The concept of a train driver operating 
their train to the signals would not change. In this case the driver had already erroneously 
anticip ated that the ne xt signal was going to be green .  Intervention by the No.2 person -in-
charge  could have changed the driver's expectation that the next signal would be green.  Any 
communication that can improve the safety of the system should be encouraged.  This is 
discussed further in the communications section of this analysis.  
4.3.16.  The driver said that he had never had his train diverted to the Down Main line at Tamaki, and 
he had not been informed of any wrong -line-running procedure for Tamaki at the time, so he 
had not expect ed his train to be routed anywhere else other than along the Up Main line. 
4.3.17.  Train drivers are trained to respond to the signals first and foremost, and not to drive 
according to assumptions.  There could be a number of reasons for signals being held at red, 
or in this case a t 'low speed '.  Regardless of why the wrong  routing occurred , if the driver had 
responded to the signals correctly the wrong route setting should not have been a danger to 
the train and its occupants.  
4.3.18.  The Commission consi dered other factors that could have affected the driver's awareness of 
the situation.

Report 10 -101 
<< Page 23 >>
 4.3.19.  The training records indicate d that the driver was adequately trained and familiar with the 
route and signals he was likely to encounter on this trip.  
4.3.20.  The driver had repo rted for duty at Westfield that morning, collected his documentation and 
then had ample time to become familiar with the daily instructions and make his own notes 
while he was a passenger on a train to Britomart to collect his first train to drive.  
4.3.21.  The dri ver had been cleared as medically fit to drive at the time. The driver 's post-incident 
medical check indicated that he had been experiencing some symptoms of stress .  Stress is 
something that can affect human performance  and quality of sleep , leading to fa tigue .  
However, the driver's shift roster was not unusual and he had just begun a normal day shift , 
so fatigue was discounted as a contributing factor. This was supported by the train data 
recorder , which  showed that on  the trip from Papakura  the driver h ad responded to the 
vigilance device and sounded the horn at level crossings and stations as required.  In other 
words he appeared to have been  driving his train normally.  
4.3.22.  The train's event recorder showed that the driver had accelerated to 55  km/h after departing 
from Panmure , and track distance information showed that the brakes had been  applied 
about 100  m before reaching the points.  Data from the  train event recorder  was consistent 
with the driver's explanation that he had left Panmure expecting to pr oceed through the 
worksite at normal speed.  
4.3.23.  When the driver did register that the signal was not as he had expected, the train data log 
showed that he reacted correctly to reduce the throttle to idle then apply full brake. 
Unfortunately this brake applicat ion was too late to prevent his train passing through the 
turnout at a speed that put the train at risk of rolling over or derailing.  
Findings  
The passenger train  passed through the low -speed turnout at about twice the 
allowable speed limit because the dri ver was not expecting his train to be routed to 
the Down Main line and he did not respond correctly to the signals leading up to the 
turnout.  
The most likely reason  for the driver  expecting the next signal , 16AC , to be displaying 
green was that while stopp ed at Panmure Station he forgot about the caution signal  
displayed on the previous warning signal that was telling him that Signal 16AC was not 
green.  
The signal alert system  that had been  installed in the train cab to help the driver  to 
remember if the last signal his train had passed was a caution was not used by the 
driver on this occasion and was not widely used by other drivers because, once 
activated , it could not be cancelled by the driver and sounded for 6 seconds with a 
loud, piercing warning tone . 
The non -standard phraseology used by the No.2 person -in-charge  of the work gang 
when calling the passenger train  to the worksite area contributed to the driver's 
assumption that his train was clear to proceed at maximum speed from Panm ure 
Station.  
 
  
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 10 -101 4.4. The signal passed at danger (SPAD)  
4.4.1.  The driver said he had been confused after his train crossed to the Down Main line at high 
speed and could not clearly recall the next sequence of events. He was aware that he had 
gone  through the turnout  above the speed  limit and that his passengers had been  concerned 
at the unusual train movements.  
4.4.2.  The driver had stopped his train in a safe position within the Tamaki Station  limits and did not 
need to move immediately.  At that point t he driver should h ave contacted train control or the 
signal box controller to find out why his train had been routed to the Down Main line against 
his expectations , but instead he  assumed  that, if he continued, his train would be re -routed to 
the Up Main line.  
4.4.3.  The driver s aid that , rather than look for the signal , he had focused on the shiny rail ahead to 
confirm that the points were set correctly to take his train back to the Up Main line. When he 
realised that the points were still set for straight through, he stopped the  train then called train 
control, but by that time his train had already passed Signal 8B showing red.  If the driver had 
been travelling within the speed limit and looking for the signal, he would have had sufficient 
time to stop the train before Signal 8B  and avoid the SPAD.  
4.4.4.  The driver was probably not in a fit state to drive the train after experiencing the shock of the 
initial over-speed  crossing to the Down Main line.  This is an example of where the train crew 
should have  discussed  their situation, a nd the train manager should have intervened before 
the driver was able to move his train on.   
4.4.5.  Veolia submitted that it would have been  in breach of the Rail Operating Code and Rail 
Operating Rules and Procedures for the train manager to intervene at this point , but the 
Commission disagrees. In section 2  of the Rail Operating Rules  and Procedures , Rule 10 4 
states  that: "In the event of unusual circumstances, the Guard/Train Manager on a passenger 
train has a shared responsibility with the Locomotive Enginee r to provide protection for the 
train when necessary and assist to resume normal operations".  The Rail Operating  Rules and  
Procedures , Section 11, Rule 6.1 define s an over -speed crossing as a "serious irregularity " 
and Rule 6.5 further require s the train manager to accompany  the driver in the cab while the 
train  is moved  to a safe position and secured to await the mandatory relief driver.  On this 
occasion the train manager was in the same car as the driver and able to meet with the driver , 
but this is no t always possible in the Auckland metro train fleet. A train crew familiar with and 
used to operating with good crew resource management would have handled this situation 
better, and possibly prevented the fourth  incident, the signal passed at danger.  
4.4.6.  Veolia also submitted that there were physical constraints on some  Auckland trains that would 
prevent train managers talking  to driver s because there was no direct ac cess to the drivers ' 
cabs from all cars in the train s.  
4.4.7.  This lack of a suitable communication system between the train driver and train manager is a 
serious safety issue raised previously in a Commission report  on an incident that occurred in 
2006  (TAIC, 2006)  and the subject of an existing open safety recommendation . The 
Commission recommended  in that report that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand  
Transport Agency  address the following safety iss ue: 
There is no requirement for operators of passenger trains to have effective 
communication between  the locomotive engineer and the onboard person -in-
charge  of passenger operations that will facilitate good crew resource 
management and be effective in emergency situations. (016/08)  
4.4.8.  The Commission is concerned that a recommendation to address such a fund amental safety 
issue remains open after nearly 4 years. The Commission is also concerned that Veolia as the 
operator of passenger train services has not addressed this issue independently of the efforts  
of the Regulator.  
 
 
Report 10 -101 
<< Page 25 >>
 Findings  
The passenger train  pass ed Signal 8B at danger (showing red) because the driver was 
not looking for the signal. Instead he had made an incorrect assumption about the 
route ahead set for his train without communicating with either the train controller or 
the signal box controller . 
The driver of the passenger train  was unlikely to have been in a fit state to drive his 
train f arther after experiencing the shock of his train crossing to the Down Main line 
through the low -speed turnout at about twice the permitted speed limit.  
The trai n taking the low -speed turnout at twice the permissible speed was a serious 
operating incident after which the driver was required to be stood down under the 
supervision of the network control manager , and accompanied and supported in the 
driving cab by th e train manager to a point where a relief driver could be arranged . 
In this case the train manager was in the same rail car as the driver, so had the 
opportunity to intervene and discuss the incident with the driver.  However, the 
operating company had not  provided the train crew with a means of effective 
communication  that would allow them to co -ordinate an emergency response if the 
train manager had been  in a separate rail car.  This is a serious safety issue that the 
Commission has previously rais ed and has yet to be resolved.  
 
 
4.5. Near miss with track worker  
4.5.1.  After the passenger train  sped through the turnout to the Down Main line, it passed within a 
few metres of a track worker who was walking along the siding  with his back to the train .   
4.5.2.  The work  gang had not started the additional work so had not formally engaged any other form 
of protection, but the members  had decided that they were going to protect the secondary 
work area with individual train detection  plus use an observer once work star ted. 
4.5.3.  The track worker was alone and not inside a protected work area at the time , so he was 
operating with individual train detection, a method of protection  that is normally used by track 
workers when moving around railway lines. As he walked near the Down Main line he was 
facing the direction from which he expected trains to approach, in the usual direction along 
the Down Main line.  The track worker was unaware of the passenger train 's presence until it 
passed him.  He had apparently not registered when he saw Points  No.15 switch to the Down 
Main line that any train approaching from the Up Main line would have been routed to where 
he intended to walk.   
4.5.4.  The track worker was nearly hit by the passenger train  because he did not follow the rules for 
the trac k occupation method he was using at the time , which required him to "maintain a 
vigilant lookout for, and detect the approach of, a train or track equipment moving in either 
direction".  
Findings  
The near miss between the passenger train  and a member of the  work gang occurred 
because the track worker was not watching out in all directions as required by the 
individual train detection method of protection that he was using when he was walking 
near the track.

 Report 10 -101 4.6. Communication   
4.6.1.  A common  factor in these incident s was poor communication among the various participants. 
More interactive communication  could have changed the outcome for the better . For example : 
1. If the Otahuhu signal box controller had passed on the train number and its time of 
departure , it is unlikel y that the Auckland signal box controller would have confused 
the order of the trains, and unlikely therefore that he would have set  the wron g route  
for the passenger train . 
2. If the Auckland signal box controller had asked the train controller for permissio n to 
switch  in Tamaki , the correct running order would have been established and the 
signal box controller would have known about the worksite  within the Tamaki Station 
limits . 
3. If the driver had alerted the train controller about the delay at Sylvia Park , the 
Auckland signal box controller may have been reminded about the passenger train 's 
position relative to the shunt . 
4. If the Auckland signal box controller had questioned the person -in-charge  about what 
he was doing at Tamaki when he applied for foul time on the siding, the signaller may 
have found out about the protected work area and the secondary work area or 
checked with the person -in-charge  before switch ing Points No.15 . 
5. If the person -in-charge  had questioned the Auckland signal box controller why Poin ts 
No.15 had been moved , the signal box controller would have been made aware of the 
worksite within the Tamaki Station limits and made the person -in-charge  aware that 
the station was switched in and under the signaller's control . 
6. If the No.2 person -in-charge  had said something to the driver of the passenger train  
about the points being in reverse , the driver could have been alerted that the next 
signal was not green and contacted the signal box controller or train controller to ask 
about their intentions  for his train . 
7. If the No.2 person -in-charge  had used the correct phraseology when calling the 
passenger train  through the worksite, the driver might not have accelerate d his train 
towards  the maximum line speed . 
8. If the  crew of the passenger train  had been  acting as a team, a discussion may have 
ensued after the over -speed crossing  to the Down Main line, and the situation 
resolved with the train controller before the train resumed it s journey and passed a 
red signal .  
4.6.2.  In th e rail industry, many o f the participants are acting alone in their workspace s; train drivers 
and signal box controllers , for example.  This places more responsibility and reliance upon the 
person  at the controls  and more dependence upon communications between other so lo 
operators and work groups for the combined safety of the industry.  An added challenge is that 
individuals and groups might be working for different operators with different procedures.  
Good communication and a common understanding will be crucial to s afe train operations.  A 
method of achieving this  is to use the princip les of crew resource management ( CRM ).   
4.6.3.  In the railway industry, participants from multiple organisations, operating companies and 
crews need to interact , so the focus of any communica tions strategy to improve safety would 
need to include all participants . In a paper presented at the American Transportation 
Research Board annual meeting in 2004 (Morgan, Kyte, Olsen, & Roop, 2004)  about the 
extent that CRM had been introduced across the North American rail industry , the authors 
identified that most applications of CRM up to 2004  were still strictly following the crews 
within a vehicle , but they also identified several other individuals who communicate d where i t 
could be of  benefit. The researchers described the potential  benefit s of introducing CRM : 
  
 
Report 10 -101 
<< Page 27 >>
 By creating a safe working environment , encouraging teamwork, improving 
situational awareness, understanding technical proficiency, and practising error 
managemen t, a work force will be created that communicates better, is more 
aware of its true situation, uses all of its available resources, and works better 
with one another.  
4.6.4.  A potential barrier is a 'silo culture '. Andrew Hopkins described a silo culture in his b ook about 
the inquiry into the Glenbrook accident in Australia (Hopkins, 2004)  as a culture having 
features of secrecy, non -co-operation, restricted communication and antagonism between 
occupational groups and organisations ; a culture where problems were usually seen as the 
exclusive concern of one group or another rather than as systemic problem s that they all 
needed to resolve.  
4.6.5.  Not all of these features of a silo culture were apparent with this incident, but some were.  For 
a successful outcome on the day of this incident  the respective participants (such as  the train 
driver, the respective signal box controllers, the train controller, the track workers and even 
the other train crew ) all needed to communicate to ensure they all  understood what was 
planned , then question each other if something in the plan changed  or was unclear . 
4.6.6.  The various procedures were designed to link the actions of all these people to achieve the 
desired outcome.  In some cases the procedures could have (a nd have since) been improved, 
but for the most part they simply were not followed.  Each time this happened there was an 
opportunity for someone to intervene , question or challenge, but this did not happen.  
4.6.7.  CRM also depends on  a change in attitude to wards  human error; the development of a just 
culture  that recognises  that human errors occur all the time and that everybody can make 
errors at any time. Even the most skilled operator is subject to human error.  
4.6.8.  If all rail participants are going to work togeth er to break down any barriers and achieve 
uniformity in communications, they need to be operating to the same standards.  A good way 
to achieve this is to have a common industry standard that all participants must meet.  
4.6.9.  The Commission has already made a re commendation to the Chief Executive of the New 
Zealand  Transport Agency to form such a standard within the framework of the National Rail 
Safety Standards , with safety recommendation number 002 -12 issued on 28 March 2012  
(TAIC, 2011) .  
The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency 
that he requires the Executive of the National Rail System Standard to develop 
standards to ensure that all rail participants meet a consistently high level of 
crew resource management, and communication that includes the use of 
standard rail phraseology (002/12).  
Terminology  
4.6.10.  A separate observation made during this investigation was the use of colloquial language  by 
the Otahuhu signal box controllers ( both signal b ox controllers involved with this incident were 
based at Otahuhu).  The Carbine Road Siding was called the 'Coke ' siding, the suburban train 
a 'subby ' and the length of freight trains expressed in 'crossing totals ' (a redundant term). 
While the use of colloquial language was not directly relevant to the wrong -route setting in this 
incident , it was a safety issue and it did indicate that the Otahuhu signal box controllers were 
not following company policy.  
4.6.11.  The safety risk of using colloquial language went  back to previous administrations , but 
involved the same signal box. In 2005 the Commission investigated a wrong routing at 
Westfield and discovered that the use of unofficial names in radio communications from the 
Otahuhu signal box controller was contribu tory (TAIC, 2005) . A sa fety recommendation was 
issued to Ontrack15 at the time to ensure that official names as noted on the signal ling and 
interlocking diagrams were used in radio communications  (this has since been closed) . The 
continued use of colloquial language  is a concern .

 Report 10 -101 Findings  
Poor communication  and specifically a lack of adequate crew resource management 
contributed to all 4 of these incidents.  
The examples given in this report that show the results of using colloquial language, 
non-standard phraseology and inadequate crew resource management lend weight to 
the Commission's previous recommendation that the rail industry adopt a national 
communication standard with which all rail participan ts must comply.  
 
 
 
  
 
Report 10 -101 
<< Page 29 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. The Auckland signal box controller set the wrong route for the passenger train at Tamaki 
because he confused the running order of the trains and thought that the shunt was the next 
train to arrive at Tam aki. 
5.2. The first reason for the Auckland signal box controller confus ing the order of trains arriving at 
Tamaki was that the Otahuhu signal box controller did not give him clear information on which 
passenger train the shunt was following.  
5.3. The proper r ail operating procedure was for signal box controllers to contact train control 
before taking manual control of signal boxes in order to obtain important information such as 
the correct running order of approaching trains and any worksite activities within  the signal 
box control zones.  The established practice of not doing this for the Tamaki signal box 
compromised the safety of rail operations.  
5.4. The Auckland signal box controller 's relief shift duties required him to switch between si gnal 
box desks or move to other location s 5 times within 4 hours, which required him to adjust 
mentally to the signal box he was working while at times having to anticipate his task at the 
next signal box.  It is possible that this disrupti ve work pattern contributed to his losing 
awareness of the trains he was signalling and consequently the order of trains arriving at 
Tamaki.  
5.5. The Auckland signal box controller would have been aware that there was a protected worksite 
within the Ta maki signal box control zone if the correct operating rules had been followed or 
he had thoroughly read the daily work bulletin before switching in the signal box.  However, the 
daily work bulletin should have made the fact clearer by directly referring t o Tamaki when 
describing the limits of the work area.  
5.6. The passenger train  passed through the low -speed turnout at about twice the allowable speed 
limit because the driver was not expecting his train to be routed to the Down Main line and h e 
did not respond correctly to the signals leading up to the turnout.  
5.7. The most likely reason for the driver expecting the next signal , 16AC , to be displaying green 
was that while stopped at Panmure Station he forgot about the caution signal  displayed o n the 
previous warning signal that was telling him that Signal 16AC was not green.  
5.8. The signal alert system that had been installed in the train cab to help the driver to remember 
if the last signal his train had passed was a caution was not used by the dri ver on this 
occasion and was not widely used by other drivers because, once activated, it could not be 
cancelled by the driver and sounded for 6 seconds with a loud, piercing warning tone.  
5.9. The non -standard phraseology used by the No.2 person -in-charge of t he work gang when 
calling the passenger train to the worksite area contributed to the driver's assumption that his 
train was clear to proceed at maximum speed from Panmure Station.  
5.10.  The passenger train  passed Signal 8B at danger ( showing red) because the driver was not 
looking for the signal. Instead he had made an incorrect assumption about the route ahead 
set for his train without communicating with either the train controller or the signal box 
controller.  
5.11.  The drive r of the passenger train  was unlikely to have been in a fit state to drive his train 
farther after experiencing the shock of his train crossing to the Down Main line through the 
low-speed turnout at about twice the permitted speed li mit. 
5.12.  The train taking the low -speed turnout at twice the permissible speed was a serious operating 
incident after which the driver was required to be stood down under the supervision of the 
network control manager , and accompanied and supported i n the driving cab by the train 
manager to a point where a relief driver could be arranged.  
5.13.  In this case the train manager was in the same rail car as the driver, so had the opportunity to 
intervene and discuss the incident with the driver.  H owever, the operating company had not 
 

<< Page 30 >>
 Report 10 -101 provided the train crew with a means of effective communication that would allow them to co -
ordinate an emergency response if the train manager had been in a separate rail car.  This is a 
serious safety issue th at the Commission has previously raised and has yet to be resolved.  
5.14.  The near miss between the passenger train and a member of the work gang occurred because 
the track worker was not watching out in all directions as required by the individual train 
detecti on method of protection that he was using when he was walking near the track.  
5.15.  Poor communication and specifically a lack of adequate crew resource management 
contributed to all 4 of these incidents.  
5.16.  The examples given in this report that show the results o f using colloquial language, non -
standard phraseology and inadequate crew resource management lend weight to the 
Commission's previous recommendation that the rail industry adopt a national communication 
standard with which all rail participants must compl y.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by 2 types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  (key safety actions)  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation  (other safety 
actions) . 
Key safety actions  
6.2. Signal -box-to-signal -box communications.  KiwiRail issued a safety briefing to all signal boxes 
on 29 September 2010. This briefing reinforced the correct communication protocol 
described in the Rail Operating Rules and Procedures for the use of radios , and instr ucted 
controllers to apply  the same princip les when using telephone s. 
6.3. Local procedures contradicting standard safety rules. KiwiRail  did not change the local 
procedure for  signal box controllers in regard to attendance  at and control of switch -in/switch -
out stations to comply with the current version of the Rail Operating Rules and Procedures, 
Section 2, Rule 92 , but other events eliminated the need at Tamaki. Soon after this incident 
the responsibility for the control of Tamaki Station  was reallocated to t he train controller in 
Wellington , then in early 2011 the Auckland signal box was shifted to Wellington.   
6.4. Isolated signal box operators. Following the planned reorganisation of the Auckland signal 
boxes that KiwiRail had initiated before this set of incide nts occurred, the Auckland, 
Newmarket and Otahuhu signal boxes have been relocated to the Wellingto n National Train 
Control Centre and the operator control desks are now adjacent to the responsible Auckland 
area train controller's desk. This has increased the pool of available staff to relieve the 
Auckland signal box control desks, eliminated the safety concern about staff working the 
'relief shift', and improved the working team environment for the signal box controllers.  
6.5. The train register being used for multiple locations. KiwiRail  has shifted the s ignal box control 
of Tamaki Station  to the Auckland area train controller. This has removed the potential 
confusion that existed when the train register system was used to control movements at 2 
separate locati ons and ensured that the person operating the Tamaki panel ha s full visibility 
of approaching trains and track occupations.  
Other s afety a ctions   
6.6. Technology solutions to SPADs . KiwiRail advised that future planned upgrades to the Auckland 
metro rail networ k include d automatic train protection  to the European Train Control System 
Level 1 standard. The trackside equipment is being progressively installed in the Auckland 
metro rail network and has been completed  where this incident occurred. T he testing of the  
trackside system was scheduled to start in July 2012 , with a prototype rail vehicle system 
installed in a n SA/SD train set.  The d esign of the on -board installation  for the new EMU s has 
also started , but KiwiRail advise d that the operator was responsib le for on -train equipment . If 
automatic train protection  system equipment  had been fitted to the passenger train  it would 
have automatically stopped the train near Signal 8B if the driver had not already applied the 
brake , but it would not have prevented t he SPAD.  
6.7. KiwiRail submitted that these future enhancements specified for on -train equipment in the 
new Auckland electric multiple units would satisfy the requirements of the safety 
recommendation described in section 7.4 so the recommendation is not neces sary. The 
example submitted was the Driver Machine Interface and a speed warning system that would 
provide advance information to the driver of speed limit ahead at a turnout. It would also 
indicate the distance to go to an advance signal at stop and a cal culated safe speed to travel 
in order to be able to stop the train before the signal.  
 

<< Page 32 >>
 Report 10 -101 6.8. The Commission recognises and agrees with the potential benefit that such systems would 
have in preventing a driver from taking a wrong route. However these systems were not in 
existence at the time the recommendation was published and if they are installed they would 
only be effective in the Auckland metro area and probably only on the new electric trains. 
Safety recommendation 023/12 described in paragraph 7.4 is aimed a t a weakness in the 
existing signal alert system as fitted to the Auckland ADL/ADC and ADK/ADB DMUs and the 
SA/SD Push Pull trains and at addressing the general lack of use of the system by drivers. The 
outcome is likely to have a national impact because t he system is also used in main line 
freight locomotives.  
6.9. Technology solutions to wrong routing. KiwiRail has installed a new train control system called 
'Rail 9000 '.  This system has been installed in the majority of the Auckland metro  rail network. 
The Rail 9000 system functions implemented by June 2012 include d visibility of all tracks to 
train controllers between Swanson in the north and Papakura in the south, thereby eliminating 
the gaps that had previously been automatically controlled but invisible. R ail 9000 also 
includes a train describer.  This feature displays both the train identification number and its 
current location to train control.  A further feature being developed will provide automatic 
route setting for each scheduled train based on the t imetable.  The train describer will 
automatically set the correct signals to drivers and be displayed on the mimic display for 
controllers. Current plans are to have this system operational during  2013. The future 
likelihood of a wrong route being set for a train has been reduced by the introduction of train 
describer technology and will be further reduced when the automatic route -setting feature of 
the Rail 9000 train control system has been  fully commissioned.   
6.10.  Improved track worker safety with signals. KiwiRail  has since provided  local trackside control 
(termed 'lock-out') to Auckland metro running signals at some stations , so that track workers 
could  hold them at stop to protect their occupation. This is seen as  a positive step towards 
providing safer conditions for track occupancies.  
6.11.  Signal  improvements at Tamaki.  KiwiRail ha s since carried out substantial works within the 
Tamaki Station  limits to remove the old station platform  and upgrade the s ignal s. The gro und 
Signal 8B is now a pole mount and Signal s 67024 and 16AC have been  changed to a double -
aspect type. This will improve the visibility of Signal 8B to make it similar to other main line 
running signals and improve the clarity of the signalling message to  drivers  approaching 
Tamaki on the Up Main line. The Up and Down Main lines on the Eastern Line have also been 
upgraded to allow bi -directional traffic and the Carbine Road Siding access modified to allow 
shunt locomotives a direct route to and from the W estfield yards without the need to cross at 
Tamaki. The situation in this investigation that led to the wrong routing when  the shunt  was 
following a passenger train is therefore unlikely to occur again.  
6.12.  Recognition of driver fatigue. Veolia Transport has since revised its training on fatigue 
management and recognition of the symptoms of fatigue. This is being provided by an outside 
contractor specialising in the subject. The first course was carried out in March 2011 and 
others have followed since then. Mod ules of fatigue management have also been added to 
entry -level packages for passenger operators and the certification courses for train managers 
and drivers. Veolia is also conducting dedicated fatigue courses to cover existing staff. The 
intent of these c ourses is to raise awareness of the symptoms of fatigue among operational 
staff and provide guidance on how to manage it.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it consid ers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the New Zealand Transpo rt 
Agency.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. On 26 October 2012  the following recommen dations were made to the  Chief Executive of the 
New Zealand  Transport Agency:  
7.4. It is a kno wn risk to the rail industry that train drivers may be distracted and forget a warning 
signal their train had recently passed.    The signal alert device that has been  installed in the 
train cab to help the driver  to remember the last warnin g signal was not used by the driver on 
this occasion .  It was also  not being used  widely  by other drivers because, once activated , the 
alarm sounded for 6 seconds and could not be cancelled .  The sound can be  easily confused 
with other 'in-cab alarms '.   
The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency 
ensure that systems put in place by New Zealand train operators to mitigate this known risk 
are effective and result in th e risk being eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level . 
(023/12 ) 
On 7th November, Man ager Rail Systems of New Zealand Transport Agency replied in part on 
behalf of the Director:  
… we will work with industry  to see that the risk referred to in the preamble to this 
recommendation is eliminated, isolated or reduced.  We believe that this will 
meet the overall objective of this recommendation.  
7.5. The daily bulletin was not clear to the Auckland signal box controlle r on the location of the 
worksite  within Tamaki Station and it was not user -friendly to signal box controllers because it 
gave locations expressed in kilometres rather than points or signal names  (the language 
typically used by signal box controllers ).   
The Commission recommends th at the  Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency 
ensure that the daily bulletins that convey critical information to rail participants are presented 
in a clear and unambiguous way . (024/12 ) 
On 7th November, Manager Rail  Systems of New Zealand Transport Agency replied on behalf 
of the Director:  
This recommendation is accepted.  Discussions on it will be initiated on t he 
publication of the final report.  These discussions will include, where appropriate, 
a projected timefr ame for implementation.  This will be advised to TAIC in due 
course.

 Report 10 -101 8. Key lessons  
 Safe rail operations are reliant upon good communication between all 
operating personnel.  
 All individuals and groups of individuals working in the rail industry need to 
unde rstand  fully and be working to a common objective before safe rail 
operations can be achieved.  
 Documents created for the purpose of providing essential information to rail 
participants should be clear, unambiguous and in a format suitable for the 
intended recipients.
