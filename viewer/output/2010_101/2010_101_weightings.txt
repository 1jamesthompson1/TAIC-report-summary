","0.0","0.0","There is no mention in the report of substance use being a factor in the incidents, so it is not applicable in this case.
","0.0","<NA>","<NA>","<NA>","0.0","The incidents did not involve level crossings, so this safety theme is not applicable to the events at Tamaki.
","0.0","15.0","The near miss with the track worker was due to the worker not watching out in all directions as required by the individual train detection method of protection. This indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures for workers in the rail corridor, which is a critical safety issue (4.5.1-4.5.4).

","0.0","0.0","Extreme weather was not a factor in the incidents, so this safety theme is not relevant.
","0.0","<NA>","<NA>","<NA>","20.0","The established practice of not contacting train control before taking manual control of signal boxes, as was the case with the Tamaki signal box, compromised the safety of rail operations. This indicates a failure in the safety management system and a lack of effective regulator monitoring to ensure adherence to proper rail operating procedures (5.3).
","0.0","10.0","The Auckland signal box controller's relief shift duties required him to switch between signal box desks multiple times within a short period, which could have contributed to his losing awareness of the trains he was signalling. This disruptive work pattern may have led to fatigue or mental strain, affecting his performance (5.4).
","0.0","30.0","The incidents at Tamaki involved poor communication and a lack of adequate crew resource management, which contributed significantly to the outcome. The report highlights multiple instances where better communication could have prevented the incidents, such as the signal box controllers not following procedures and the driver not using available systems to ensure correct signal interpretation. The report also notes the potential benefits of introducing CRM across the rail industry to improve safety outcomes (4.6.1-4.6.9).
","0.0","1.667","The report does not indicate that maintenance issues or mechanical failures were factors in the incidents, so this safety theme does not apply.
