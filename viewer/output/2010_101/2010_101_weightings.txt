However, fatigue was discounted as a contributing factor for the train driver, as he had just begun a normal day shift and appeared to have been driving his train normally (4.3.21).
","0.0","20.0","The Auckland signal box controller set the wrong route for the passenger train due to confusion about the running order of the trains (5.1). The driver of the passenger train did not respond correctly to the signals leading up to the turnout, likely because he forgot about the caution signal displayed on the previous warning signal (5.7). Additionally, the track worker was nearly hit by the passenger train because he was not watching out in all directions as required (5.14).
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document that suggests the operators were engaged in non-essential activities that diverted their attention from controlling their respective responsibilities.
","0.0","15.0","Human error played a significant role, with the Otahuhu signal box controller not providing clear information to the Auckland signal box controller (5.2), and the driver of the passenger train making incorrect assumptions about the route ahead without verifying with the signal box controller or train controller (5.10).
","0.0","10.0","The established practice of not contacting train control before taking manual control of signal boxes, specifically for the Tamaki signal box, compromised the safety of rail operations (5.3). Additionally, the daily work bulletin did not make clear the presence of a protected worksite within the Tamaki signal box control zone (5.5).
","0.0","25.0","Poor communication and inadequate crew resource management contributed to all four incidents. Examples include the lack of clear information exchange between signal box controllers, the driver not alerting the train controller about the delay, and the train manager not intervening after the over-speed crossing to the Down Main line (4.6.1-4.6.9, 5.12).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide evidence that a lack of training or preparedness for emergency procedures contributed to the incidents.
","0.0","0.0","There is no information in the document that suggests emergency response planning and coordination were factors in the incidents.
","0.0","0.0","The incidents described do not appear to be related to maintenance procedures or compliance issues with vehicles or equipment.
","0.0","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems were not relevant to the incidents described in the document.
","0.0","10.0","The incidents occurred partly due to non-compliance with established rail operating procedures, such as the failure to follow proper communication protocols and the established practice of not contacting train control before taking manual control of signal boxes (5.3).
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication that equipment design and specifications were a factor in the incidents.
","0.0","3.333","Risk assessment and management appear to have been insufficient, as evidenced by the lack of awareness of the protected worksite within the Tamaki signal box control zone and the failure to follow established procedures that could have prevented the incidents (5.5).
","2.887","0.0","Weather conditions were not mentioned as a factor in the incidents.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of structural integrity or material fatigue issues contributing to the incidents.
","0.0","11.667","The use of colloquial language and non-standard phraseology by the Otahuhu signal box controller, such as referring to the suburban train as a 'subby', contributed to the confusion and miscommunication that led to the wrong route being set for the passenger train (4.6.10). This represents a safety issue related to communication standards and practices within the organization.","2.887","true","N/A"
