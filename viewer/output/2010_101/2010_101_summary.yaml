- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Fatigue was considered as a potential factor affecting the driver's performance. However, the report indicates that "the driver's shift roster was not unusual and he had just begun a normal day shift, so fatigue was discounted as a contributing factor" (4.3.21). Therefore, while fatigue management is a relevant safety theme, it had a minimal impact on the incidents described in the report.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: Human error and assumptions played a significant role in the incidents. The Auckland signal box controller set the wrong route due to confusion about the running order of the trains (5.1), and the driver of the passenger train made incorrect assumptions about the signal and the route his train would take (5.6, 5.7, 5.10). These errors were pivotal in the unfolding of the events.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report does not indicate a lack of training or competency as direct contributors to the incidents. However, it does mention that the driver was adequately trained and familiar with the route and signals (4.3.19), suggesting that while training and competency are always relevant, they were not the primary issues in this case.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The report mentions that the signal alert system installed in the train cab was not used by the driver (5.8), indicating a potential lack of familiarity or reluctance to use the equipment. However, this was not the main cause of the incidents but rather a contributing factor to the driver's failure to respond correctly to the signals.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Poor crew resource management contributed significantly to the incidents. The report highlights the lack of effective communication and coordination among the train crew, signal box controllers, and track workers (4.6.1). The absence of CRM principles such as teamwork and communication was evident in the failure to prevent the wrong route setting and the subsequent incidents (5.12, 5.13).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The failure to adhere to safety procedures was a critical factor. The established practice of contacting train control before taking manual control of signal boxes was not followed (5.3), and the signal box controller did not thoroughly read the daily work bulletin (5.5). These deviations from safety procedures directly contributed to the incidents.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'While the report does not explicitly discuss organizational safety culture, the incidents suggest issues with communication and adherence to procedures that could be indicative of broader cultural problems within the organizations involved. However, there is insufficient information to determine the extent to which safety culture influenced the incidents.

    '
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not provide evidence that risk management and analysis were factors in the incidents. There is no mention of inadequate risk assessments or safety plans contributing to the events.

    '
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the report that a lack of regulatory oversight or non-compliance with regulations was a contributing factor to the incidents.

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The driver's loss of situational awareness contributed to the incidents, particularly when he forgot about the caution signal displayed on the previous warning signal (5.7). However, this was one aspect of a broader set of communication and human error issues.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Emergency response preparedness was not a factor in the incidents as they did not involve an emergency response situation.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not suggest that maintenance or inspection regimes were related to the incidents.

    '
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Automation was not mentioned as a factor in the incidents. The report does not discuss any issues related to automated systems or their operation.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions were not a factor in the incidents, as there is no mention of weather affecting the events or decisions made.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Communication breakdown was a significant factor, as evidenced by the failure to effectively exchange information among the signal box controllers, train driver, and track workers (4.6.1). However, this theme is closely related to human error and assumptions, and CRM, which have been given more weight due to their more direct impact on the incidents.
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the report that contributed to the incidents beyond those already defined.
