2010_101,023/12,The Commission recommends that the chief executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency ensures that systems put in place by New Zealand train operators designed to mitigate this known risk are effective and result in the risk being eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level,"Train drivers becoming distracted and forgetting the aspect of warning signals their train has recently passed is a known risk to the rail industry.  The signal alert device that was installed in train cabs to help drivers remember the aspect of the last signal their train had passed was not used by the driver on this occasion and was not widely used by other drivers because, once activated, the alarm sounded for 6 seconds and could not be cancelled and the sound was easily confused with other in-cab alarms.    ","Bulletins are sent out with important information that some recipients do not comprehend or disregard as being unimportant to them. The format of such an important document should be reviewed by KiwiRail in consultation with the target audience to ensure that it clearly conveys the appropriate information.
