  \ 4 separate but connected incidents that occurred at Tamaki:   \n\uF0B7 a wrong\
  \ route was set by the Auckland signal box controller  for the \npassenger train\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the driver of the passenger train  respond ed to the 'low speed ' signal\
  \  \ntoo late and h is train followed the wrong route from the Up Main line \nto\
  \ the Down Main line at a dangerously high speed  \n\uF0B7 the driver of the passenger\
  \ train  made a wrong assumption that his \ntrain would be re -routed from the Down\
  \ Main line to the Up Main line \nand passed  a red signal at stop (SPAD) by several\
  \ metres  \n\uF0B7 a track worker was not actively looking in both directions  for\
  \ trains \nwhile walking near the track , so narrowly avoid ed being  hit by the\
  \ \npassenger train  after it had taken the wrong route . \nIneffective communicatio\
  \ n was a factor common to all 4 incidents.   \n4.2. The wrong route setting  \n\
  4.2.1.  The Auckland signal box controller set a wrong route for the passenger train\
  \  because he \nmisunderstood  the correct running order of the trains adjacent\
  \ to the shunt.  \n4.2.2.  When an unscheduled serv ice like the shunt was to be\
  \ signalled on  to the controlled network \nat Westfield bound for Tamaki, there\
  \ was a standard procedure that should have been \nfollowed. The driver of the unscheduled\
  \ shunt w ould contact the Otahuhu signal box controller \nand reques t clearance\
  \ for the trip to  the Carbine Road Siding. The signal box controller would \nseek\
  \ approval from the train controller for the movement , then set the signals for\
  \ the shunt to \ndepart from the Westfield yards at the approved time and conditions.\
  \  The p rocedure was \nfollowed correctly up to this point.  \n4.2.3.  The Auckland\
  \ signal box controller needed to take manual control of the Tamaki signal box.\
  \ He \nneeded to know the correct order of the trains arriving at Tamaki and what\
  \ worksite  activity \nwas occurring within the signal box control zone . \n4.2.4.\
  \  When the shunt entered  the main line at Otahuhu bound for the Carbine Road Siding\
  \ via \nTamaki, this information needed to be passed to the Auckland signal box\
  \ controller.  In this \ncase the Auckland signal box c ontroller had already taken\
  \ manual control of Tamaki because \nhe had earlier had to arrange blocking protection\
  \ for the work gang, so the Otahuhu signal box \ncontroller was responsible for\
  \ passing on this information to him.  \n4.2.5.  The rail operating rule  (Rail\
  \ Ope rating Rules and Procedures, Section L1.1, paragraph 1.3.3) \nsaid:  \nWhen\
  \ attended, it will be necessary to advise the adjacent Signalbox/Panel \nconcerned\
  \ of the running order of all trains, except suburban passenger services \nunless\
  \ they are running 5 minutes or more late . \n4.2.6.  During interviews both signal\
  \ box controllers and their manager said that this  procedure  was \nnormally observed\
  \  by giving the planned or actual time the shunt entered the Up Main line and \n\
  the train number for the passe nger train it was following.  This would have been\
  \ an effective \nway to pass on the information.  It would have been better if the\
  \ procedure  had simply said \nthis.  However, the Otahuhu signal box controller\
  \ did not follow that usual practice.  He did not \ngive the departure time of the\
  \ shunt from Westfield and did not even give its destination as \nthe 'Carbine Road\
  \ Siding '.  Nor did he give the train number of the passenger train it was \nfollowing.\
  \  Instead he said the shunt was following the 'subby '.  The omission of this important\
  \ \ninformation was the first of several communication failures that resulted in\
  \ the wrong route \nbeing set for the passenger train.  \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Report\
  \ 10 -101 4.2.7.  The Auckland signal box controller erroneously thought that the\
  \ 'subby ' was another \npassenger tr ain that had already passed through Tamaki,\
  \ so he thought the shunt was the \nnext train to arrive at Tamaki and set the route\
  \ for it to cross to the Down Main line. \n4.2.8.  Following this incident KiwiRail\
  \  issued a safety briefing to all signal box  contro llers (on 29 \nSeptember 2010\
  \ ). The safety briefing reinforced the correct communication protocol \ndescribed\
  \ in the Rail Operating Rules and Procedures for use over radios11 and instructed\
  \ \nsignal box co ntrollers to apply  the same princip les when using telephon es,\
  \ which  the signal \nbox controllers had used in this case.  \n4.2.9.  The rail\
  \ operating rules for radio communication required that all messages be acknowledged\
  \ \nand that when instructions were  issued the instructions be read back and confirmed\
  \ as \ncorrect by the sender.  Even if that process had been followed by the signal\
  \ box controllers on \nthe telephone , this would not have resolved this situation\
  \ because the Auckland signal box \ncontroller would simply have repeated back the\
  \ information given to him by the Otahu hu \nsignal box controller : \"Following\
  \ the subby, L9, light engine, Tamaki\" .  He would have been \nnone the wiser for\
  \ what that actually meant.  \n4.2.10.  Under different circumstances, if Tamaki\
  \ had not already been switched in for manual control \nwhen the shunt  left Westfield,\
  \ the Auckland signal box controller should have contacted the \ntrain controller\
  \ before doing so  in accordance with operating rules12.  The train controller \n\
  should then have confirmed with the Auckland signal box controller the order of\
  \ trains  arriving \nat Tamaki .  Had this happened it is highly likely that the\
  \ Auckland signal box controller would \nhave realised which passenger train the\
  \ shunt was following.  The wrong routing would have \nbeen avoided.  \n4.2.11.\
  \  However, there was a longstanding local proc edure that circumvented the  application\
  \ of this \nrule for Tamaki signal box .  This local procedure removed the second\
  \  opportunity to establish \nthe correct order of the trains.  It also removed\
  \ an opportunity for the Auckland signal box \ncontroller to understand the situation\
  \  fully regarding worksite s within  the Tamaki Station \nlimits.  \n4.2.12.  KiwiRail\
  \ said that t he reason for this local procedure for Tamaki was a management \n\
  interpretation of a rule regarding 'attendance ' at a signal box  and the description\
  \ of Tamaki as \na 'switch out ' station . KiwiRail's belief was that, as the Auckland\
  \ signal box controller was \ncontinual ly in attendance at the Britomart main control\
  \ room and as that person was also \nresponsible for Tamaki, the 'station switch\
  \ in ' checking procedure did not apply. The rule had \nbeen revised in mid-2008\
  \ to prevent such a misinterpretation , but the local proce dure for \nTamaki had\
  \ remained in place.   \n4.2.13.  The operating  function of a  signal box is conceptually\
  \ the same whether it is called  a 'switch \nin' or 'switch out ' signal box : it\
  \ facilitates manual control of the local area . Tamaki was termed \na 'switch out\
  \ ' signal box and its normal state was switched out to allow the signals to operate\
  \ \nin automatic  mode . 'Switch in ' signal boxes were ones that had less than\
  \ 24/7 attendance , so \nthe rules were intended to cover th e situation where a\
  \ signal box controller would arrive  and \nunlock the signal box then take over\
  \ local signalling control for the area. Tamaki was not a \nphysical signal box\
  \ but the control mimic was displayed on the Auckland signal box control \ndesk\
  \ and operated from that desk when required.  Whatever the term a scribed to the\
  \ type of \nsignal box, the signals within that control zone are in either automatic\
  \ (switched out) or \nmanual (switched in) mode and to switch in the signal box\
  \ is to take over manual control.  \nTherefore the rule (see footnote 12) about\
  \ taking ma nual control of a signal box should have \napplied  rather than the\
  \ local procedure . \n4.2.14.  The control of Tamaki was transferred from the Auckland\
  \ signal box controller to the train \ncontroller after this incident , removing\
  \ any  future  likelihood of a recurrence  of this wrong route \nsetting . \n  \
  \                                                      \n11 Section 1 2 - Radio\
  \ Procedures . \n12 Rail Operating Rules and Procedures, Section 2 - Operating Rule\
  \ s, Rule  92(b) \n \nReport 10 -101 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.2.15.  If the Auckland\
  \ signal box controller had been  in doubt  about the train running order , he could\
  \ \nhave positively identified the train in front of the shunt by any one of 4 methods\
  \ : \n1. He could have asked the Otahuhu signal box controll er for the passenger\
  \ t rain \nnumber . \n2. He could have switched display tabs from his normal train\
  \ register display to the \nOtahuhu signal box tab and seen what train number had\
  \ left from there ahead of the \nshunt . \n3. He could have asked the train controller\
  \ . \n4. He coul d have deduced the correct running order from his own Auckland\
  \ train register  \nbased upon his estimate of the departure time of the shunt from\
  \ Westfield . \nThe Auckland signal box controller did not use any of these options\
  \ to identify which train was \nin fron t of the shunt . Instead he made an incorrect\
  \ assumption that the 'subby ' was a train he \nhad just logged as arriving at Britomart.\
  \  \n4.2.16.  However, t he train register display was not user -friendly when it\
  \ was used beyond its design \npurpose for movements at both Tam aki and Britomart\
  \ , because trains were listed in the \nAuckland train register in the time order\
  \ that they were arriving at or departing from Britomart.   \nWhen the train register\
  \ was also used to control movements at Tamaki it required the operator \nto interpr\
  \ et the display  mentally to obtain the true running order.   For example , the\
  \ shunt was \nterminating at Tamaki but had left Westfield immediately after the\
  \ passenger train , so their \napparent arrival times at Britomart would be in the\
  \ reverse order. The passen ger train  would \narrive  at Britomart  in about 21\
  \ minutes and appear at the bottom of the list , while the shunt's \narrival at\
  \ Tamaki  would be near the top in 9 minutes.  The only indicator  that the 2 trains\
  \ were \ngoing to different destinations would be the Auckland signal box controller\
  \ 's notes  in the \ncomments column of his train register to identify that the\
  \ shunt 's arrival time was actually for \nTamaki rather than for Britomart .  \n\
  4.2.17.  The Auckland signal box controller made 2 errors when he entered the event\
  \ for  the shunt into \nhis train register for  its planned movement to Tamaki.\
  \   He entered the train  as a departing \nevent from Tamaki rather than arriving\
  \ and  he only allowed 4 minutes ' running time to \nTamaki , when the normal duration\
  \ was about 9 minutes.  These err ors individually were  minor , \nbut they could\
  \ have been  an indication that the Auckland signal box controller was not \nfocused\
  \ entirely on the task at hand  or that he was confused about which signal box control\
  \ \ndesk he was operating at the time . \n4.2.18.  The Auckland signal box controller\
  \ said that he was rested but his shift pattern for the period \nimmediately preceding\
  \ this incident had been  different from  his normal patterns. He was \nnormally\
  \ based at Otahuhu but in the previous few days he had been at Auckland (2 sep arate\
  \ \nsignal boxes) for one day, Otahuhu for 2 days, then 2 days on a relief shift\
  \ from 1000 to 1810 \nat all 3 signal boxes.  \n4.2.19.  The duties  in a normal\
  \ shift would be to operate a single control desk for the whole 8 -hour \nshift.\
  \ The relief shift was intended to cover meal breaks for signal box controllers\
  \ and \nconsisted of multiple short stints (less than 2 hours each) at different\
  \ signal boxes around \nAuckland. A person working this shift would have to settle\
  \ into each new location, operate the \ncontrol desk for an  hour or so , then relocate\
  \ to the next signal box to repeat the cycle. The fast \ncycle pattern of the relief\
  \ shift duties demanded considerably more mental effort from a \ncontroller  and\
  \ may have facilitated minor errors .  \n4.2.20.  On the day of the incident the\
  \ Auckl and signal box controller was just about to complete his \nfourth  separate\
  \ stint in the 2 signal boxes based in the Britomart main control room in the 3.5\
  \ \nhours he had been on duty. He then had to travel by train to Otahuhu for his\
  \ last stint for the \nday.  \n4.2.21.  The Auckland signal box controller said\
  \ that the mental demands of the relief shift required  \nhim continually  to anticipate\
  \ the next control desk he was to operate because he had to swap \nso often between\
  \ them .  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Report 10 -101 4.2.22.  When considering the poor\
  \ information the Auckl and signal box controller received about the \ntrain running\
  \ order, it is feasible that his frequent change between control desks  contributed\
  \ \nto his losing awareness of what trains he wa s dealing with and in what order\
  \ . \nThe bulletin information was not clear  to all parties  \n4.2.23.  Signal\
  \ box controller s are required to  read the current daily information bulletin\
  \ s at the start of \ntheir shift s.  The daily information bulletin issued on 13\
  \ August 2010 (see an extract from it in \nAppendix 3) lis ted 13 protected worksite\
  \ s on the Auckland metro rail network that day.  Two of \nthose sites were within\
  \ the Auckland signal box controller's zone : one at Tamaki and one at \nOrakei.\
  \  The Auckland signal box controller said that, o n the day of this incident, he\
  \ had read \nthe daily bull etin but neither he nor the Otahuhu signal box controller\
  \ were  aware of the \ncompulsory -stop-protected work area on the Up Main line\
  \ along the Eastern Line . \n4.2.24.  The Auckland signal box controller said that\
  \ his reason for misunderstanding the bulletin was \nthat i t did not describe the\
  \ location in terms he used every day : signals, points and stations. \nHe also\
  \ acknowledged that he could have found this information if required. The stations\
  \ \neither side of Tamaki were named , but even though the work area was within\
  \ the Tamaki \nStation  limits, Tamaki was not named in the bulletin.   \n4.2.25.\
  \  It is a safety issue if bulletins are sent out with important information that\
  \ some recipients do \nnot comprehend or disregard as being unimportant  to them\
  \ . The format of s uch an important \ndocument should  be reviewed by KiwiRail\
  \  in consultation with the target audience  to ensure  \nthat it clearly conveys\
  \ the appropriate information . The Commission has made a safety \nrecommendation\
  \ to the N ew Zealand  Transport Agency to address this safety issue.  \n \nFindings\
  \  \nThe Auckland signal box controller set the wrong route for the passenger train\
  \  at \nTamaki because he confused the running order of the trains and thought that\
  \ the \nshunt was the next train to arrive at Tamaki . \nThe first reason for the\
  \ Auckland signa l box controller confus ing the order of trains \narriving at Tamaki\
  \ was that the Otahuhu signal box controller did not give him clear \ninformation\
  \ on which passenger train the shunt was following.   \nThe proper rail operating\
  \ procedure was for signal box contro llers to contact train \ncontrol before taking\
  \ manual control of signal box es in order to obtain important \ninformation such\
  \ as the correct running order of approaching trains and any worksite  \nactivit\
  \ ies within the signal box control zones .  The established p ractice of not doing\
  \ \nthis for the Tamaki signal box compromised the safety of rail operations.  \n\
  The Auckland signal box controller 's relief shift duties required him to switch\
  \ between \nsignal box desks or move to other location s 5 times within 4 hours,\
  \ which  required \nhim to adjust  mentally  to the signal box he was working while\
  \ at times having to \nanticipate his task at the next signal box.  It is possible\
  \ that this disruptive work \npattern contributed to hi s losing awareness of the\
  \ trains he was signalling  and \nconsequently the order of trains arriving at Tamaki.\
  \  \nThe Auckland signal box controller would have been aware that there was a protected\
  \ \nworksite  within the Tamaki signal box control zone if the correct operating\
  \ rules  had \nbeen followed or he had thorough ly read the daily work bulletin\
  \ before switching in the \nsignal box.  However, the daily work bulletin should\
  \ have made the fact  clearer by \ndirectly referring to Tamaki when describing\
  \ the limits of the work area.  \n \n \n \nReport 10 -101 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.3.\
  \ Taking the wrong route  at high speed  \n4.3.1.  The train took the wrong route\
  \  at high speed  because the driver did not observe and correctly \nrespond to\
  \ the signals in front of his train .  Signal 67024 before Panmure  displayed yellow,\
  \ \nwhich meant the driver should  not have expect ed a green signal  around t he\
  \ corner ahead \nafter leaving Panmure.  On most occasions on the same route the\
  \ driver would have had both \nsignals  showing green; nevertheless , on this occasion\
  \ Signal 67024 was yellow,  so the driver \nshould have driven his train with the\
  \ expectation that h e might have to stop at the next signal, \nor as in this case\
  \ , had his train at a low speed for crossing to the Down Main line. \n4.3.2.  By\
  \ coincidence, t he inner warning board for the compulsory -stop-protected work\
  \ area was \npositioned  next to Signal 67024.   The driv er confirmed that he had\
  \ seen the  yellow  caution \nsignal .  He  said that he had associated the caution\
  \ signal  on Signal 67024 with the  warning \nboard  for the compulsory -stop-protected\
  \ work area within Tamaki .  He had incorrectly \nconcluded that the person  in\
  \ charge was controlling the signals for access to his work area .  \n4.3.3.  The\
  \ track signal and worksite warning board were independent of each other:  the signal\
  \ was \ncontrolling the train, and the warning board was warning of the worksite\
  \ ahead.   The \ninterpretation t hat the driver expressed was unique , so it was\
  \ examined further. Several driver \ntrainers at the Veolia train driving school\
  \ and the company safety investigator were questioned \nabout the relationship between\
  \ these 2 signalling systems , and the driver traini ng syllabus \nand rail operating\
  \ rules were reviewed.   Other drivers involved with the investigation were also\
  \ \nquestioned. None of the people spoken to had made the same interpretation  as\
  \ the driver of \nthe passenger train , and neither could it be inferred fr om the\
  \ operating rules  or training \nsyllabus . \n4.3.4.  A more logical or believable\
  \ scenario was that the driver simply forgot that Signal 67024 was \ndisplaying\
  \ a yellow signal  after he had  stopped to exchang e passengers at Panmure.  It\
  \ is not \nuncommon for train drivers to forget they had pass ed a  caution signal\
  \ .  For example  a driver \nmay become distracted during an intervening passenger\
  \ stop .  The experience of some drivers \nforgetting a caution signal  was one\
  \ reason for installing a signal alert system  in the cabs.  \n4.3.5.  The train\
  \ was fitted with a signal alert system that was intended to help drivers remember\
  \ \nwhen they passed an advance signal that warned that the next signal would not\
  \ be green.  It is \na driver -activated distance -measuring  device that pulses\
  \ a light and sounds a buzzer as the \ntrain approaches the next signal and is intended\
  \ to counteract any intervening distractions, \nsuch as stopping at a station. \
  \ \n4.3.6.  Drivers were expected to  use the signal alert device s when passing\
  \ signals displaying caution \nsignal s, as Signal 67024  was on this day .  The\
  \ signal alert button was not in common use by \nVeolia drivers and some drivers\
  \ said they had adopted their own alternative methods  for \nrememb ering caution\
  \ signal s. The driver of the passenger train  did not use the signal alert \ndevice\
  \  when he approached Panmure Station  and he said he used  no alternative system.\
  \  If \nthe driver had used the signal alert system it would have reminded him about\
  \ the n ext signal \njust after his train departed  Panmure.  \n4.3.7.  One reason\
  \ that Veolia gave for drivers not using the signal alert device  was that the sound\
  \ of \nits alarm was so similar to several other in -cab alarms that drivers were\
  \ reluctant to use it.   \nAnother reason  given was that o nce the driver pushed\
  \ the button and the train ha d travelled a \nfurther 600 m, the alarm then sound\
  \ ed for a full 6 second s with a  loud, piercing  warning  tone \nthat could not\
  \  be cancelled by the driver. Trains approaching Britomart sometimes  travel led\
  \ \nclose behind other trains and could therefore frequently pass yellow signals.\
  \  If the signal alert \nsystem had been  always used at yellow signals it would\
  \ soon have lost its effectiveness as an \nalert and become a nuisance distraction\
  \ . \n4.3.8.  While the in tention of the signal alert system  to minimise signals\
  \ being passed at danger  was \na proactive measure designed to mitigate an identified\
  \ risk, the fact that it has not been \nsuccessful in operation means the issue\
  \ will need to be revisited.  The Commission has made \na safety recommendation\
  \ to the New Zealand  Transport Agency to address this safety issue.  \n4.3.9. \
  \ There were  2 other sources of distraction that could possibly have contributed\
  \ to the driver \nforgetting or not realising  that the next signal ahead was no\
  \ t green . They were  that the driver \n \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Report 10 -101 was\
  \ overly focused on making up the delay to his train running schedule, and the misleading\
  \ \ninstruction given by the  No.2 person -in-charge  at the worksite.  \n4.3.10.\
  \  The stop at Sylvia Park was longer than normal at 5.6 minutes, al though the\
  \ driver said that \nhe had not noted how long it was. The driver stated in his\
  \ interview that his train running  \nbehind time  was on his mind and he was intent\
  \ upon making up time before arriving at \nBritomart if at all possible.  When questioned\
  \ abou t this , he understood that catching up to his \nschedule would have been\
  \ an impractical goal , but he considered that by minimising delays \nand taking\
  \ advantage of the in -built slack in the timetable, he could reduce the total delay\
  \ \nslightly by the time he rea ched Britomart.  \n4.3.11.  It was the driver's\
  \ responsibility to inform train control if his train was not running to \nschedule14,\
  \ but he had not done so. The train controller and the Auckland signal box controller\
  \ \nwere not aware of the delay to the passenger train  and the next formal time\
  \ check station was \nnot until after Tamaki.  \n4.3.12.  When the passenger train\
  \  was ready to depart from Panmure Station , the driver obtained \nclearance from\
  \ the  No.2  person -in-charge  to proceed past his compulsory stop board , but\
  \ the \nresponse wa s misleading and contrary to current procedure at the time.\
  \ He gave a speed \nreference in his clearance to the driver by using the phrase\
  \ 'normal speed ', which meant to a \ntrain driver the 'maximum allowable speed\
  \ limit ' for the train and the track at that p oint.  The \ncorrect radio procedure\
  \ at the time was not to indicate any speed unless the maximum speed  \nwas lower\
  \ than normal speed.  \n4.3.13.  Often trains are delayed at compulsory -stop-protected\
  \ worksite s as the track workers move \ntheir people and equipment clear o f the\
  \ track , so the driver may have expected to be delayed . \nHowever,  in this case\
  \ the work  gang was clear of the track and waiting for the train. The \nincorrect\
  \ phraseology used for the clearance was misleading , but the driver di d not challenge\
  \ \nit at the time. It was also compatible with  the driver's intent  to make up\
  \ time because it would \nhave allowed him to pass  quickly  through the worksite\
  \ .  \n4.3.14.  At this point there w ere 2 opportunit ies for communications to\
  \ change the outcome. The driver \ncould have queried the perceived speed clearance\
  \ . Secondly,  the No.2 person -in-charge  was \nnot required to advise the driver\
  \ about the reverse condition of the points , but had he \nmentioned it, the information\
  \  could have challenged the driver's min d-set that the next signal \nwas green.\
  \  \n4.3.15.  KiwiRail did not agree with the concept of the track worker giving\
  \ information about the points \nposition to the driver because it could lead to\
  \ \"unintended safety risks \".  By that KiwiRail \nmeant that this advice could\
  \ be seen as \"overriding the importance of, and reliance on, the \nsignalling system\"\
  .  The Commission does not agree.  The concept of a train driver operating \ntheir\
  \ train to the signals would not change. In this case the driver had already erroneously\
  \ \nanticip ated that the ne xt signal was going to be green .  Intervention by\
  \ the No.2 person -in-\ncharge  could have changed the driver's expectation that\
  \ the next signal would be green.  Any \ncommunication that can improve the safety\
  \ of the system should be encouraged.  This is \ndiscussed further in the communications\
  \ section of this analysis.  \n4.3.16.  The driver said that he had never had his\
  \ train diverted to the Down Main line at Tamaki, and \nhe had not been informed\
  \ of any wrong -line-running procedure for Tamaki at the time, so he \nhad not expect\
  \ ed his train to be routed anywhere else other than along the Up Main line. \n\
  4.3.17.  Train drivers are trained to respond to the signals first and foremost,\
  \ and not to drive \naccording to assumptions.  There could be a number of reasons\
  \ for signals being held at red, \nor in this case a t 'low speed '.  Regardless\
  \ of why the wrong  routing occurred , if the driver had \nresponded to the signals\
  \ correctly the wrong route setting should not have been a danger to \nthe train\
  \ and its occupants.  \n4.3.18.  The Commission consi dered other factors that could\
  \ have affected the driver's awareness of \nthe situation.  \n                 \
  \                                       \n14 Rail Operating Rules and Procedures,\
  \ Section 2, Rule 90 (h).  \n \nReport 10 -101 \n<< Page 23 >>\n 4.3.19.  The training\
  \ records indicate d that the driver was adequately trained and familiar with the\
  \ \nroute and signals he was likely to encounter on this trip.  \n4.3.20.  The driver\
  \ had repo rted for duty at Westfield that morning, collected his documentation\
  \ and \nthen had ample time to become familiar with the daily instructions and make\
  \ his own notes \nwhile he was a passenger on a train to Britomart to collect his\
  \ first train to drive.  \n4.3.21.  The dri ver had been cleared as medically fit\
  \ to drive at the time. The driver 's post-incident \nmedical check indicated that\
  \ he had been experiencing some symptoms of stress .  Stress is \nsomething that\
  \ can affect human performance  and quality of sleep , leading to fa tigue .  \n\
  However, the driver's shift roster was not unusual and he had just begun a normal\
  \ day shift , \nso fatigue was discounted as a contributing factor. This was supported\
  \ by the train data \nrecorder , which  showed that on  the trip from Papakura \
  \ the driver h ad responded to the \nvigilance device and sounded the horn at level\
  \ crossings and stations as required.  In other \nwords he appeared to have been\
  \  driving his train normally.  \n4.3.22.  The train's event recorder showed that\
  \ the driver had accelerated to 55  km/h after departing \nfrom Panmure , and track\
  \ distance information showed that the brakes had been  applied \nabout 100  m before\
  \ reaching the points.  Data from the  train event recorder  was consistent \nwith\
  \ the driver's explanation that he had left Panmure expecting to pr oceed through\
  \ the \nworksite at normal speed.  \n4.3.23.  When the driver did register that\
  \ the signal was not as he had expected, the train data log \nshowed that he reacted\
  \ correctly to reduce the throttle to idle then apply full brake. \nUnfortunately\
  \ this brake applicat ion was too late to prevent his train passing through the\
  \ \nturnout at a speed that put the train at risk of rolling over or derailing.\
  \  \nFindings  \nThe passenger train  passed through the low -speed turnout at about\
  \ twice the \nallowable speed limit because the dri ver was not expecting his train\
  \ to be routed to \nthe Down Main line and he did not respond correctly to the signals\
  \ leading up to the \nturnout.  \nThe most likely reason  for the driver  expecting\
  \ the next signal , 16AC , to be displaying \ngreen was that while stopp ed at Panmure\
  \ Station he forgot about the caution signal  \ndisplayed on the previous warning\
  \ signal that was telling him that Signal 16AC was not \ngreen.  \nThe signal alert\
  \ system  that had been  installed in the train cab to help the driver  to \nremember\
  \ if the last signal his train had passed was a caution was not used by the \ndriver\
  \ on this occasion and was not widely used by other drivers because, once \nactivated\
  \ , it could not be cancelled by the driver and sounded for 6 seconds with a \n\
  loud, piercing warning tone . \nThe non -standard phraseology used by the No.2 person\
  \ -in-charge  of the work gang \nwhen calling the passenger train  to the worksite\
  \ area contributed to the driver's \nassumption that his train was clear to proceed\
  \ at maximum speed from Panm ure \nStation.  \n \n  \n \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Report\
  \ 10 -101 4.4. The signal passed at danger (SPAD)  \n4.4.1.  The driver said he\
  \ had been confused after his train crossed to the Down Main line at high \nspeed\
  \ and could not clearly recall the next sequence of events. He was aware that he\
  \ had \ngone  through the turnout  above the speed  limit and that his passengers\
  \ had been  concerned \nat the unusual train movements.  \n4.4.2.  The driver had\
  \ stopped his train in a safe position within the Tamaki Station  limits and did\
  \ not \nneed to move immediately.  At that point t he driver should h ave contacted\
  \ train control or the \nsignal box controller to find out why his train had been\
  \ routed to the Down Main line against \nhis expectations , but instead he  assumed\
  \  that, if he continued, his train would be re -routed to \nthe Up Main line. \
  \ \n4.4.3.  The driver s aid that , rather than look for the signal , he had focused\
  \ on the shiny rail ahead to \nconfirm that the points were set correctly to take\
  \ his train back to the Up Main line. When he \nrealised that the points were still\
  \ set for straight through, he stopped the  train then called train \ncontrol, but\
  \ by that time his train had already passed Signal 8B showing red.  If the driver\
  \ had \nbeen travelling within the speed limit and looking for the signal, he would\
  \ have had sufficient \ntime to stop the train before Signal 8B  and avoid the SPAD.\
  \  \n4.4.4.  The driver was probably not in a fit state to drive the train after\
  \ experiencing the shock of the \ninitial over-speed  crossing to the Down Main\
  \ line.  This is an example of where the train crew \nshould have  discussed  their\
  \ situation, a nd the train manager should have intervened before \nthe driver was\
  \ able to move his train on.   \n4.4.5.  Veolia submitted that it would have been\
  \  in breach of the Rail Operating Code and Rail \nOperating Rules and Procedures\
  \ for the train manager to intervene at this point , but the \nCommission disagrees.\
  \ In section 2  of the Rail Operating Rules  and Procedures , Rule 10 4 \nstates\
  \  that: \"In the event of unusual circumstances, the Guard/Train Manager on a passenger\
  \ \ntrain has a shared responsibility with the Locomotive Enginee r to provide protection\
  \ for the \ntrain when necessary and assist to resume normal operations\".  The\
  \ Rail Operating  Rules and  \nProcedures , Section 11, Rule 6.1 define s an over\
  \ -speed crossing as a \"serious irregularity \" \nand Rule 6.5 further require\
  \ s the train manager to accompany  the driver in the cab while the \ntrain  is\
  \ moved  to a safe position and secured to await the mandatory relief driver.  On\
  \ this \noccasion the train manager was in the same car as the driver and able to\
  \ meet with the driver , \nbut this is no t always possible in the Auckland metro\
  \ train fleet. A train crew familiar with and \nused to operating with good crew\
  \ resource management would have handled this situation \nbetter, and possibly prevented\
  \ the fourth  incident, the signal passed at danger.  \n4.4.6.  Veolia also submitted\
  \ that there were physical constraints on some  Auckland trains that would \nprevent\
  \ train managers talking  to driver s because there was no direct ac cess to the\
  \ drivers ' \ncabs from all cars in the train s.  \n4.4.7.  This lack of a suitable\
  \ communication system between the train driver and train manager is a \nserious\
  \ safety issue raised previously in a Commission report  on an incident that occurred\
  \ in \n2006  (TAIC, 2006)  and the subject of an existing open safety recommendation\
  \ . The \nCommission recommended  in that report that the Chief Executive of the\
  \ New Zealand  \nTransport Agency  address the following safety iss ue: \nThere\
  \ is no requirement for operators of passenger trains to have effective \ncommunication\
  \ between  the locomotive engineer and the onboard person -in-\ncharge  of passenger\
  \ operations that will facilitate good crew resource \nmanagement and be effective\
  \ in emergency situations. (016/08)  \n4.4.8.  The Commission is concerned that\
  \ a recommendation to address such a fund amental safety \nissue remains open after\
  \ nearly 4 years. The Commission is also concerned that Veolia as the \noperator\
  \ of passenger train services has not addressed this issue independently of the\
  \ efforts  \nof the Regulator.  \n \n \nReport 10 -101 \n<< Page 25 >>\n Findings\
  \  \nThe passenger train  pass ed Signal 8B at danger (showing red) because the\
  \ driver was \nnot looking for the signal. Instead he had made an incorrect assumption\
  \ about the \nroute ahead set for his train without communicating with either the\
  \ train controller or \nthe signal box controller . \nThe driver of the passenger\
  \ train  was unlikely to have been in a fit state to drive his \ntrain f arther\
  \ after experiencing the shock of his train crossing to the Down Main line \nthrough\
  \ the low -speed turnout at about twice the permitted speed limit.  \nThe trai n\
  \ taking the low -speed turnout at twice the permissible speed was a serious \n\
  operating incident after which the driver was required to be stood down under the\
  \ \nsupervision of the network control manager , and accompanied and supported in\
  \ the \ndriving cab by th e train manager to a point where a relief driver could\
  \ be arranged . \nIn this case the train manager was in the same rail car as the\
  \ driver, so had the \nopportunity to intervene and discuss the incident with the\
  \ driver.  However, the \noperating company had not  provided the train crew with\
  \ a means of effective \ncommunication  that would allow them to co -ordinate an\
  \ emergency response if the \ntrain manager had been  in a separate rail car.  This\
  \ is a serious safety issue that the \nCommission has previously rais ed and has\
  \ yet to be resolved.  \n \n \n4.5. Near miss with track worker  \n4.5.1.  After\
  \ the passenger train  sped through the turnout to the Down Main line, it passed\
  \ within a \nfew metres of a track worker who was walking along the siding  with\
  \ his back to the train .   \n4.5.2.  The work  gang had not started the additional\
  \ work so had not formally engaged any other form \nof protection, but the members\
  \  had decided that they were going to protect the secondary \nwork area with individual\
  \ train detection  plus use an observer once work star ted. \n4.5.3.  The track\
  \ worker was alone and not inside a protected work area at the time , so he was\
  \ \noperating with individual train detection, a method of protection  that is normally\
  \ used by track \nworkers when moving around railway lines. As he walked near the\
  \ Down Main line he was \nfacing the direction from which he expected trains to\
  \ approach, in the usual direction along \nthe Down Main line.  The track worker\
  \ was unaware of the passenger train 's presence until it \npassed him.  He had\
  \ apparently not registered when he saw Points  No.15 switch to the Down \nMain\
  \ line that any train approaching from the Up Main line would have been routed to\
  \ where \nhe intended to walk.   \n4.5.4.  The track worker was nearly hit by the\
  \ passenger train  because he did not follow the rules for \nthe trac k occupation\
  \ method he was using at the time , which required him to \"maintain a \nvigilant\
  \ lookout for, and detect the approach of, a train or track equipment moving in\
  \ either \ndirection\".  \nFindings  \nThe near miss between the passenger train\
  \  and a member of the  work gang occurred \nbecause the track worker was not watching\
  \ out in all directions as required by the \nindividual train detection method of\
  \ protection that he was using when he was walking \nnear the track.  \n \n \n \n\
  \n<< Page 26 >>\n Report 10 -101 4.6. Communication   \n4.6.1.  A common  factor\
  \ in these incident s was poor communication among the various participants. \n\
  More interactive communication  could have changed the outcome for the better .\
  \ For example : \n1. If the Otahuhu signal box controller had passed on the train\
  \ number and its time of \ndeparture , it is unlikel y that the Auckland signal\
  \ box controller would have confused \nthe order of the trains, and unlikely therefore\
  \ that he would have set  the wron g route  \nfor the passenger train . \n2. If\
  \ the Auckland signal box controller had asked the train controller for permissio\
  \ n to \nswitch  in Tamaki , the correct running order would have been established\
  \ and the \nsignal box controller would have known about the worksite  within the\
  \ Tamaki Station \nlimits . \n3. If the driver had alerted the train controller\
  \ about the delay at Sylvia Park , the \nAuckland signal box controller may have\
  \ been reminded about the passenger train 's \nposition relative to the shunt .\
  \ \n4. If the Auckland signal box controller had questioned the person -in-charge\
  \  about what \nhe was doing at Tamaki when he applied for foul time on the siding,\
  \ the signaller may \nhave found out about the protected work area and the secondary\
  \ work area or \nchecked with the person -in-charge  before switch ing Points No.15\
  \ . \n5. If the person -in-charge  had questioned the Auckland signal box controller\
  \ why Poin ts \nNo.15 had been moved , the signal box controller would have been\
  \ made aware of the \nworksite within the Tamaki Station limits and made the person\
  \ -in-charge  aware that \nthe station was switched in and under the signaller's\
  \ control . \n6. If the No.2 person -in-charge  had said something to the driver\
  \ of the passenger train  \nabout the points being in reverse , the driver could\
  \ have been alerted that the next \nsignal was not green and contacted the signal\
  \ box controller or train controller to ask \nabout their intentions  for his train\
  \ . \n7. If the No.2 person -in-charge  had used the correct phraseology when calling\
  \ the \npassenger train  through the worksite, the driver might not have accelerate\
  \ d his train \ntowards  the maximum line speed . \n8. If the  crew of the passenger\
  \ train  had been  acting as a team, a discussion may have \nensued after the over\
  \ -speed crossing  to the Down Main line, and the situation \nresolved with the\
  \ train controller before the train resumed it s journey and passed a \nred signal\
  \ .  \n4.6.2.  In th e rail industry, many o f the participants are acting alone\
  \ in their workspace s; train drivers \nand signal box controllers , for example.\
  \  This places more responsibility and reliance upon the \nperson  at the controls\
  \  and more dependence upon communications between other so lo \noperators and work\
  \ groups for the combined safety of the industry.  An added challenge is that \n\
  individuals and groups might be working for different operators with different procedures.\
  \  \nGood communication and a common understanding will be crucial to s afe train\
  \ operations.  A \nmethod of achieving this  is to use the princip les of crew resource\
  \ management ( CRM ).   \n4.6.3.  In the railway industry, participants from multiple\
  \ organisations, operating companies and \ncrews need to interact , so the focus\
  \ of any communica tions strategy to improve safety would \nneed to include all\
  \ participants . In a paper presented at the American Transportation \nResearch\
  \ Board annual meeting in 2004 (Morgan, Kyte, Olsen, & Roop, 2004)  about the \n\
  extent that CRM had been introduced across the North American rail industry , the\
  \ authors \nidentified that most applications of CRM up to 2004  were still strictly\
  \ following the crews \nwithin a vehicle , but they also identified several other\
  \ individuals who communicate d where i t \ncould be of  benefit. The researchers\
  \ described the potential  benefit s of introducing CRM : \n  \n \nReport 10 -101\
  \ \n<< Page 27 >>\n By creating a safe working environment , encouraging teamwork,\
  \ improving \nsituational awareness, understanding technical proficiency, and practising\
  \ error \nmanagemen t, a work force will be created that communicates better, is\
  \ more \naware of its true situation, uses all of its available resources, and works\
  \ better \nwith one another.  \n4.6.4.  A potential barrier is a 'silo culture '.\
  \ Andrew Hopkins described a silo culture in his b ook about \nthe inquiry into\
  \ the Glenbrook accident in Australia (Hopkins, 2004)  as a culture having \nfeatures\
  \ of secrecy, non -co-operation, restricted communication and antagonism between\
  \ \noccupational groups and organisations ; a culture where problems were usually\
  \ seen as the \nexclusive concern of one group or another rather than as systemic\
  \ problem s that they all \nneeded to resolve.  \n4.6.5.  Not all of these features\
  \ of a silo culture were apparent with this incident, but some were.  For \na successful\
  \ outcome on the day of this incident  the respective participants (such as  the\
  \ train \ndriver, the respective signal box controllers, the train controller, the\
  \ track workers and even \nthe other train crew ) all needed to communicate to ensure\
  \ they all  understood what was \nplanned , then question each other if something\
  \ in the plan changed  or was unclear . \n4.6.6.  The various procedures were designed\
  \ to link the actions of all these people to achieve the \ndesired outcome.  In\
  \ some cases the procedures could have (a nd have since) been improved, \nbut for\
  \ the most part they simply were not followed.  Each time this happened there was\
  \ an \nopportunity for someone to intervene , question or challenge, but this did\
  \ not happen.  \n4.6.7.  CRM also depends on  a change in attitude to wards  human\
  \ error; the development of a just \nculture  that recognises  that human errors\
  \ occur all the time and that everybody can make \nerrors at any time. Even the\
  \ most skilled operator is subject to human error.  \n4.6.8.  If all rail participants\
  \ are going to work togeth er to break down any barriers and achieve \nuniformity\
  \ in communications, they need to be operating to the same standards.  A good way\
  \ \nto achieve this is to have a common industry standard that all participants\
  \ must meet.  \n4.6.9.  The Commission has already made a re commendation to the\
  \ Chief Executive of the New \nZealand  Transport Agency to form such a standard\
  \ within the framework of the National Rail \nSafety Standards , with safety recommendation\
  \ number 002 -12 issued on 28 March 2012  \n(TAIC, 2011) .  \nThe Commission recommends\
  \ to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency \nthat he requires the Executive\
  \ of the National Rail System Standard to develop \nstandards to ensure that all\
  \ rail participants meet a consistently high level of \ncrew resource management,\
  \ and communication that includes the use of \nstandard rail phraseology (002/12).\
  \  \nTerminology  \n4.6.10.  A separate observation made during this investigation\
  \ was the use of colloquial language  by \nthe Otahuhu signal box controllers (\
  \ both signal b ox controllers involved with this incident were \nbased at Otahuhu).\
  \  The Carbine Road Siding was called the 'Coke ' siding, the suburban train \n\
  a 'subby ' and the length of freight trains expressed in 'crossing totals ' (a redundant\
  \ term). \nWhile the use of colloquial language was not directly relevant to the\
  \ wrong -route setting in this \nincident , it was a safety issue and it did indicate\
  \ that the Otahuhu signal box controllers were \nnot following company policy. \
  \ \n4.6.11.  The safety risk of using colloquial language went  back to previous\
  \ administrations , but \ninvolved the same signal box. In 2005 the Commission investigated\
  \ a wrong routing at \nWestfield and discovered that the use of unofficial names\
  \ in radio communications from the \nOtahuhu signal box controller was contribu\
  \ tory (TAIC, 2005) . A sa fety recommendation was \nissued to Ontrack15 at the\
  \ time to ensure that official names as noted on the signal ling and \ninterlocking\
  \ diagrams were used in radio communications  (this has since been closed) . The\
  \ \ncontinued use of colloquial language  is a concern . \n                    \

  \  and specifically a lack of adequate crew resource management \ncontributed to\
  \ all 4 of these incidents.  \nThe examples given in this report that show the results\
  \ of using colloquial language, \nnon-standard phraseology and inadequate crew resource\
  \ management lend weight to \nthe Commission's previous recommendation that the\
  \ rail industry adopt a national \ncommunication standard with which all rail participan\
  \ ts must comply.  \n \n \n \n  \n \nReport 10 -101 \n<< Page 29 >>"
