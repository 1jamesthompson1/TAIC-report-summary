The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly  it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. During the morning peak period on 3 April 2017, trains in the Wellington Railway Station yard 
were being controlled by two signal  box operators (signal lers) from the Wellington signal box. 
1.2. Signal maintainers were at the time working on a track signalling fault in the area . 
1.3. The s ignallers were setting the route for a shunt locomotive to recover a set of empty 
passenger carriages from Platform 9.  The signal ling fault prompted  the signallers to use an 
alternative route for the shunt locomotive to access Platform 9.  
1.4. However, the rou te they chose  was not physical ly possible due to the design configuration for 
some of the crossing points in the area.  The signallers were not aware that the route they had 
set was not possible because the mimic screen  they were referring to in the signal  box 
erroneously displayed their chosen route as valid (possible).  
1.5. As a result of the way the points were set , the shunt locomotive was diverted down another 
section of track into a potential head -on collision with a departing passenger train.  The driver 
of the shunt locomotive reali sed that his train was routed down the wrong track and stopped 
his train, but not before it encroached onto the track where the loaded passenger train was 
heading. Both trains were approaching a  red signal that would have requi red them to stop 
anyway, but potentially only metres apart.  
1.6. The driver of the passenger train saw the red light , and a train encroaching onto his track 
ahead , and stopped his train.  There was no collision and nobody was injured.  
1.7. The Transport Accident Inv estigation Commission (Commission) found  that the error on the 
mimic screen was the result of an equipment upgrade program me that had overlooked a 
design aspect of one set of crossing points and had not ensure d that the new system was fully 
representative of the actual track layout. The error with the mimic screen and a missing 
interlock had gone undetected for many years . 
1.8. The Commission also found  that neither of the signal lers on duty at the time was aware that 
they had wrong -routed the shunt locomotive , because they were unaware of the limitations of 
the crossing points that prevented the shunt locomotive travelling along the chosen route . 
1.9. The Commission also found  that the signal box did not have an interlock to prevent the 
signallers setting a route fo r the shunt locomotive that was not physically possible due to the 
design of one of the crossing points.  An interlock would have prevented the incident.  
1.10.  The Commission identified two key safety issues : 
 the change management process for upgrading the signa l box display had not ensure d 
that the mimic screen matched the physical track layout, and had not detect ed the 
absence of an interlock to prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration 
over which it  was not possible for rail traffic to trave l 
 the signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment 
capabilit ies in the Wellington yard that they were controlling.  
1.11.  The Commission made two recommendations  to KiwiRail  Limited  to address these safety  
issues.  
1.12.  Key lessons  arising from th is inquiry were : 
 when changes are made to safety -critical systems, the new system s should be fully 
tested for correct functionality, and the users of the system s should be trained in and 
familiar with them  
 personnel controlling the movement of rail traffic should follow procedures rather than 
make assumptions regarding the status of signalling equipment.

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On Monday 3  April 2017 the NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission (Commission) of the  incident. The Commission opened an inquiry under section 
13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to determine the 
circumstances and causes of the occurrence, and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. Commission investigators cond ucted a site examination on 3 April 2017 , includ ing an 
examination of  the Wellington signal box to obtain photographic evidence.  
2.3. Investigators interviewed the train driv er on Tuesday 4 April 2017, the  remote control operator  
(RCO)2 on Wednesday 5 April 2017 , and the two signallers  on Friday 7 April 2017 . 
2.4. The Commission obtained the following documents and records for analysis : 
 the signalling and interlocking diagram  
 the signal log output data for the movement s of the shunt locomotiv e and the passenger 
train  
 witness statements  and interviews  
 the training records for the signal box operators  
 the rosters and timesheets for the signal box operators  
 the record of operating incidents for the  persons involved  
 the record of track  and sign alling faults in the Wellington signal box ar ea from 2012 to  the 
date of the occurrence  
 the commissioning records for  the signal box  mimic  screen3 display installation  in 2010  
 records of i nterviews with personnel involved in the design and commissioning of  the 
mimic screen . 
2.5 On 9 April 2018  the Commission approved the draft report for distribution to interested persons 
for comment . 
2.7. Two submissions were received.  The Commission considered the submissions, and changes as 
a result of those submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.8. On 23 May 2018  the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1 Background  
3.1.1  The incident involved a shunt  locomotive travelling southbound from the mechanical repair depot 
to recover passenger carriages from Platform 9 at Wellington Railway Station .  The intended route  
of the shunt  locomotive is shown  in red in Fig ure 1.  The actual route taken by the shunt locomotive 
is depicted by the blue line . 
3.1.2  At around the same time, a passenger train was scheduled to depart from Platform 6 and travel 
to Upper Hutt .  The intended route of the passenger train is shown in black in Fig ure 1.  
3.1.3  The train movements were controlled by signal box operator s (signaller s) from the Wellington 
signal box. The signallers used a system of control levers to change mechanically the position s 
of points and signals within Wellington  Railway S tation limits in order to set path s for trains . 
3.1.4  The Wellington signal box display had been  upgrade d in 2010 .  The upgrade had  included the 
installation of a visual display panel , known as a mimic screen , that provided information to the 
signal lers on the status of signalling equipment.  Prior to the upgrade the  system had provided 
basic information regarding  what section of track was occupied  by a train , but it had not 
indicate d any route setting for  its movement.   The mimic screen was the signaller's primary tool 
for monitoring the status of the signals and points that were controlled from the signal box .

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 3.2 Narrative  
3.2.1  On 3 April 2017 the Wellington signal box was being operated by two signallers  during the 
morning peak  period.  Signaller A was the signaller in charge . 
3.2.1  At about 0750  one of the signallers  observed a track fault  that affected train movements to and 
from  two of the nine passenger platforms . The fault was reported for  attendance by a signals 
maintainer  (the maintainer) , who arrived on site at about 0900.  
3.2.2  Owing  to the nature of the track fault, signaller B left the signal box to operate manually the 
points where the fault had occurred  until the maintainer was  on site. Signaller B returned to the 
signal box after  the maintainer  arrived . 
3.2.3  On returning to the signal box , signaller B  was tasked by signaller A to operat e signal levers  
under his direction .  Signaller A was involved in telephone and radio communications  with train 
drivers and maintenance staff.  
3.2.4  At 0932 a 'proceed ' signal was given to the passenger train in readiness for its  depart ure from 
its platform . However,  the next signal remained at stop because there were other movements 
taking place at the time , which the signalling system recognised as a potential conflict.  
3.2.5  At about 0935 the  shunt locomotive  was required to travel southbound  to collect passenge r 
cars from Platform 9.  An RCO was driving the shunt locomotive from a safe riding position  at 
the front of the locomotive, using a remote control  unit. The RCO requested permission from 
signaller  A to begin the move towards the platform . 
3.2.6  Before the movem ent could commence , signaller A needed  to set a route for the shunt 
locomotive by altering points towards the platform.  
3.2.7  At about  the same time,  the Upper Hutt -bound passenger  train  was scheduled  to depart 
northbound  from Platform 6 .  
3.2.8  Signaller  B was instructed by signaller A to set the route for  the shunt locomotive . The selected 
route  was that depicted by the red dotted line in Figure 1. T he mimic screen showed that the 
route was set as signaller B had intended .  However, the configuration of one  particular set of 
points  through which  the shunt locomotive had to travel was known as a 'single slip switch '4 
(see A ppendix 1) .  This configuration did not provide for  rail traffic to follow the route displayed 
on the mimic screen .  Unbeknown to the signallers, the route was set for the shunt locomotive 
to follow the path of the blue line , contrary to the mimic display.  
3.2.9  The maintainer working at the location of the track fault  confirmed with signaller A  by radio that 
the points in his area were in the  correct position for the shunt locomotive to proceed to 
platform  9.  The maintainer then moved  to a safe place  clear of the track . 
3.2.10  Signaller A  glanced at the mimic screen in side the signal box and noted  the route set for the 
shunt locomotive.  
3.2.11  The shunt locomotive was stopped at a red signal.  Signaller A gave verbal authority to the RCO 
on the shunt locomotive to pass the red signal and proceed to  the next red signal  near the track 
fault shown by the red dotted line in Figure 1 .  He gave verbal  authority in the belief that the 
signalling system  would not be able to provide  a proceed  signal because of  the track fault . 
3.2.12  At 0935:40 the RCO stopped the shunt locomotive  when he realised that the track he was on 
was leading him  to a different loc ation from the one that  had be en authorised by signaller A  
(see Figure 3). He then informed signaller A by radio that the route had been  incorrectly set.

3.2.13  At 0936 :32 the Upper Hutt passenger train  began  moving away from  Platform 6 under a 
proceed signal. Eleven seconds later the driver stopped  his train as he observed both a stop 
aspect on the next signal and the shunt locomotive  encroaching onto his track  ahead  (see 
Figure 4).

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 3.2.14  At 0938  signaller A instructed the driver of the passenger train  to change ends and return his 
train to the platform.  
3.2.15  At 0945  signaller B informed the network control manager6 of the incident . The network control 
manager went to the signal box a short time later  to investigate . 
3.3 Key personnel  
3.3.1  This incident  was initially interpreted by the operator as a wrong -side failure7.  In this context  it 
was suspected that there had been an equipment failure that sent  the shunt locomotive to the 
wrong  location . Consequently  none of the staff involved underwent a post -incident drug and 
alcohol test.  
Signaller A  
3.3.2  Signaller A  had been operating the Wellington signal box since  March 2004 . 
3.3.3  On the day of the incident  it was his first shift back at work after two rostered days  off. He had 
started work at 0530  and at the time of the  incident had been on duty for four  hours.  
Signaller B  
3.3.4  Signaller B  had commenced service as a trainee signal box operator  on 11 July 2016 and gained 
certific ation on 18 October 2016.  
3.3.5  Signaller B had started work at 0530 and been on duty for four  hours at the time of the incident . 
The day prior to the inc ident signaller B had worked a nine -hour shift that commenced at 0450.    
The passenger train  driver  
3.3.6  The driver of the Upper Hutt -bound passenger train  had 28 years ' rail experience , including five 
years as a signaller . It was his firs t shift after two rostered days off.  
The shunt locomotive  driver  (RCO)   
3.3.7  The RCO had 15 years ' rail experience. It was his first shift after two rostered days off.

 4 Analysis  
4.1 Introduction  
4.1.1  The circumstances and causes of this incident can be  described as a combination of active and 
latent failures leading to a near miss.   
4.1.2  'Active failure ' is a term used to describe unsafe acts that can be directly linked to an accident, 
typically the actions of the people involved.  'Latent failures ' are contributing factors that lie 
dormant in the wider system for days, weeks or , as with this incident, even years.  
4.1.3  The potential collision was averted through  the actions taken by  both train drivers . The 
signalling system ensured that the signals in front of each train remained at stop.  
4.1.4  The following analysis discusses the circumstances that led to  the shunt locomotive being 
diverted into the path of the north bound passenger train . The analysis also discus ses two key 
safety issue s:  
 the process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensured that the mimic screen  
matched the physical track layout , and had not detect ed the absence of an interlock8 to 
prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration over which it  was not possible for 
rail traffic to travel  
 the signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment capabilit ies in 
the Wellington yard that they were controlling.  
4.1.5  The incident occurred in an  area where train speed was limited to a maximum of 20 kilometres 
per hour . The shunt locomotive was inadvertently routed towards a track that had been 
prepared for a depart ing passenger train.  
4.2 What happened  
4.2.1  The signalling system for the Wellington yard is a logic -based system that interprets  electronic 
feedback from signalling equipment to determine if the correct conditions are met before 
actions are allowed .  For example, if the system recognises that a set of points is in the correct 
position and the track in advance is unoccupied, a proceed signal will be given into that section 
when  requested .  Conversely, if the signallin g system recognises that the require d conditions 
are not met, a proceed signal will be rejected and the signal will remain at stop  (red) .  
4.2.2  The signalling system can also be enhanced by interlocks, which prevent operators setting 
conflicting signalling conditions . For example , an interlock wo uld not allow an operator to move 
a set of points if the signal controlling entry to that section were  displaying green . In order to 
move the points, the operator would have to  satisfy the safety conditions of the interlocking 
design by placing  the signal to stop first.  
4.2.3  Signallers  are authorised to  give verbal authority to train drivers to pass signals at stop if the 
signalling system is unable to provide a proceed signal.  Because t his is an override of the 
signalling system , procedures are in place to regulate its use (see section 4.4.3). 
4.2.4  At the time of the incident t here was a track fault, referred to as a 'dropped track '9, that was 
affecting the normal operating method of directing trains in to and out of platforms  8 and 9  (see 
Figure 5). The fault was causing the signalling system to read the track as being occupied and 
could not provide a proceed signal into the affected track section , or set the points for trains to 
enter the section .  That was why the signaller or the maintainer w as required to hand -wind the 
affected  points rather than operate them from the signal box.  
                                                        
8 Controls fitted between  points and signals that prevent the signaller setting conflicting routes . 
9 A dropped track occurs when the signalling system shows an unoccupied section of track as occupied, usually due to an electri cal 
circuit fault but potentially because of a broken rail. This is a method of fail -safe protection that prevents signals being cleared into the 
affected section or points being remotely moved from their current position s.

4.2.5  An alternative route existed that would hav e placed the shunt locomotive at  the intended  
location . Howev er, the alternative  route utilised the main passenger running lines , and for this 
reason the signallers were  in the habit of avoiding it if  possible  (see Figure 6).  If this route had 
been set the signalling system should have been able to provide a proceed indication  on the 
first signal facing the shunt locomotive , thereby  negating the need for signaller A to give verbal 
authority  to the RCO  for the shunt locomotive to proceed  past a red signal .

4.2.6  Instead, the route shown in Figure 7 was selected. However , because of the single slip switch 
design it was not physically  possible  for trains to travel over this route and t here was no 
interlock fitted to the levers in the signal box to prevent it being s elected . Furthermore, an 
inaccuracy  in the mimic display allowed a valid route to be displayed.   These two failures are 
discussed further in the following sections.

4.2.7  The signalling system also prevented the passe nger train receiving a proceed signal  because of 
the conflicting way the points had been set  for the shunt locomotive .  The signalling system 
performed as designed and therefore should have prevented a collision . 
4.3 Latent failures in t he signalling system  
Safety issue - The process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensure d that the mimic  
screen matched the physical track layout, and had not detect ed the absence of an interlock to 
prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration over which it  was not possible for rail 
traffic to travel.  
Mimic screen  
4.3.1  From their signal box, signallers were not able to physically see the entire Wellington yard.  
Therefore the mimic display was their primary tool for  knowing the status of the signals and the 
routes that were set for trains.  Any fault in the mimic display  was therefore serious.  
4.3.2  Figure 8 shows a screenshot of the mimic display in the Wellington signal box as it was 
observed by the signallers at the time of the incident.  Based on the information displayed, they 
were led to believe  that the shunt locomotive would follow the path of the red arrow , when really 
the route was set for the shunt locomotive to follow the blue arrow , toward s the path set for the 
passenger train.

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 4.3.4  The mimic screen had been  designed in 2010  by an independent contractor.   The process of 
commissioning the mimic screen  had involved testing that electronic inputs from signalling 
equipment matched what was being displayed on the screen.  The testing regime had included 
an electrical wire count and continuity checks, circuit ch ecks and functional tests.  All testing 
had proved correct in that the mimic screen was displaying exactly the information it had been 
provided .  However, the layout of the physical track, specifically the location of the single slip 
switch , meant that an error had been  introduced that was not identified until this incident 
occurred.  The f inal acceptance of the system had been  signed off by KiwiRail's predecessor , 
New Zealand Railways Corporation . 
4.3.5  The investigation found that the particular points configur ation resulting in the mimic screen 
showing an impossible  route through the single slip switch  had not form ed part of the 
commissioning process.  No evidence was found to suggest that the single slip switch 
configuration had been  considered at any time during the design, implementation and testing of 
the mimic screen.    
 
 
Figure 9 
Schematic drawing  of signal box panel before replacement by mimic screen  
4.3.6  Figure 9 is a schematic drawing of the signal box display panel before it was replaced by the 
electronic mimic screen display.  This provided  a more accurate display of the limitations of the 
single slip switch .  The schematic shows that using number 42 points (shown in red ) it is 
possible to cross the yellow line and continue through number 43 points (shown in blue ) (the 
route the shunt locomotive took) , but it is not possible to v eer left onto the yellow line  (where 
the signallers intended the shunt to go) .  However,  the mi mic screen  gave  the signallers  the 
false impression that rail traffic could  move  from the red to the yellow line s as shown in  Figure 
8.  A comparison between  the schematic drawing and the functionality of the mimic screen 
would have revealed this anomaly.  
4.3.7  The omission  of the single slip switch configuration during the design, testing and 
commissioning processes was an oversight that  had introduced a latent failure to the 
Wellington signal box system.  
Track interlocking  
4.3.8  There was one other set of points of the same single slip switch configuration in the Wellington 
signal box controlled area .  This set of points was  fitted with  locking protection  (an interlock) on 
the levers in the signal box  to prevent any incorrect alignment .  No suc h interlock  had been  
fitted to  the points involved in this occurrence .  KiwiRail advised that it had checked all 
available records dating back to the 1950s and had been  unable to establish why locking 
protection had not been fitted to  both sets of single slip switches . 

 
Final Report RO -2017 -102 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.3.9  An interlock  would have prevented the  points being incorrectly a ligned and conse quently the 
mimic screen would not have displayed a n incorrect route. The signaller authorised the shunt 
locomotive movement based on the in correct information displayed on the mimic screen.  
4.3.10  Having  an interlock preventing the points being incorrectly configured was another important 
defence that would  have prevented the incident  - this was a latent failure that had gone 
unnoticed or undetected  for at least  60 years.  If the process for upgrading the signal box display 
had included a failure mode effect analysis, this omission may have been identified.  
4.3.11  KiwiRail has since changed the mimic display so that it accurately reflects the functionality o f 
the equipment in the yard , and fitted an interlock to the levers in the signal box to prevent 
signallers attempting to set incorrect route s through the single slip switch.  
4.4  Active failures  
Safety issue - The signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment 
capabilit ies in the Wellington yard that they were controlling.  
4.4.1  Before even reaching the first set  of points, the shunt locomotive had to pass a signal that was 
showing red.  Signall er A said he had assumed  that the signal would not be able  to be placed at 
proceed because of the track fault in the adjacent section of track.  Based on this belief, he did 
not instruct signaller B to  change the signal to proceed by activating the request  lever in the 
signal box.  This was an incorrect assumption.  The track fault was not affecting the 
performance of the signal  and under normal circumstances, had the request lever  been 
activated , the shunt locomotive would have received a proceed signal . 
4.4.2  However,  the signalling system was preventing  the signal being placed at proceed because the 
route displayed on the mimic screen was not physically possible due to the design of the points.   
The route was partially set in the wrong direction , which the sig nalling system recognised as a 
conflict .  The signalling system was working as designed.  Having assumed that he would not  
succeed in obtaining a proceed indication on the signal facing the shunt locomotive , signaller A 
gave verbal authority for the shunt locomotive to pass it at red.  KiwiRail had a procedure that 
the signaller was required  to follow before doing that.  
4.4.3  KiwiRail's Operating Rules stated in part:  
93(c) Authorising Passing of Signals at "Stop"  
(i) Any signal, except a Departure or Intermediate si gnal, may be passed at "Stop" on instruction 
from the Signaller who directly controls that signal.  
(ii) Permission to pass a signal at "Stop" must not be given when a fixed signal can be used for this 
movement.  
(iii) Permission to pass a signal at "Stop" must only be  given when the train is stopped at the signal . 
(iv) The Signaller, before giving permission to pass a signal at "Stop", must:  
 Ensure all points are correctly set and secure for the intended movement.  
 Ensure that the route is clear up to the next fixed signal i n advance.  
 Ensure another train has not encroached onto the section of track.  
 Ensure that a conflicting movement has not been signalled or authorised . 
 If an obstruction exists check it is safe for the proposed movement and the Locomotive 
Engineer is briefe d. 
 Operate the lever or computer command to 'clear' the signal (a lever must be left in this 
position until the movement has cleared the points over which the movement is being 
authorised).  
NOTE:  This prevents opposing signals being cleared, also activates  level crossing alarms in close 
proximity to the signal.  
4.4.4  Although the rules  did not stipulate the measures that signallers s hould take to ensure  that all 
points were  correctly set and secure for the intended movement , arguably the signallers in this 
incident  complied with this requirement  (the first bullet point) .  The maintainer had confirmed 
with signaller A  that the points affected by the track fault  had been manually set for platform 9 , 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -102 and the mimic screen in front of them was indicating that the  route was correctly set, even 
though it was not.   
4.4.5  The second to fifth b ullet points were complied with ; however , the last bullet point was not.  T he 
signal lever was not operated to clear the signal and left in that position .  As mentioned above, 
the sig nallers did not do this because they were working on the assumption that they would not 
be able to clear the signal because of the track fault.  Under the circumstances, this failure to 
follow procedure was not a factor contributing to the incident.  Even if the lever request had 
been operated , the signal facing the shunt locomotive  would have remained red  because of the 
incorrect route setting.  Not being able to clear the signal would  likely have confirm ed signaller 
A's belief that he would be unable to clear the signal because of the track fault.  Neverthe less, it 
is of concern that he did not follow that part of the procedure.  
4.4.6  Notwithstanding the fault in the mimic screen, the signallers  had a surprising lack of familiarity 
with the physical layout of the yard they were controlling, particularly  as one of the signallers 
had some 13 years' experience  in the Wellington signal box.  The fact that no -one was aware 
that the mimic screen was not representative of the actual yard la yout is an issue. If any one had 
been aware of the anomaly, it would be equally surprising that they had not raised the issue.  
Signallers ' familiarity with the Wellington yard layout is an issue that KiwiRail need s to address.  
4.5 Summary  
4.5.1  A number of events an d conditions aligned on the day to allow the potential  collision to occur.  
Fortunately an actual collision was averted due to  the d iligence of the two train drivers involved.  
However, to manage risk well and prevent similar incidents or actual coll isions in future, it is 
better  to address the safety issues further up the  causal chain, the system issues, rather than 
rely on the final defence to prevent accidents  occurring . 
4.5.2  The lack of an interlock on the relevant control box levers and the  errors that were made when 
the signal box was modernised to include a mimic screen to replace a schematic diagram were 
latent failures , and the absence of either could have prevented the wrong -routing of the shunt 
locomotive.  
4.5.3  The presence of a track fault was a condition on the day that, in the busy peak period for the 
Wellington yard, created the need for the signallers to adapt the normal route for the shunt  
locomotive . Their  lack of familiarity with the equipment in the yard was a knowledge -based 
issue, because they were unaware that the route they set for the shunt locomotive was not 
physically possible.  
4.5.4  The signallers taking actions based on an erroneous assumption that the starting signal  would 
be affected by the track fault was not a factor contributi ng to the wrong -routing .  However, 
based on that assumption they omitted to follow a required procedure that in different 
circumstances could contribute to incidents and accidents in future.

 5 Findings  
5.1 The mimic screen in the sign al box was the primary tool for the signal  box operators  to identify 
the location and status of rail traffic and signalling equipment , yet it was giving them 
erroneous information about the validity of the chosen route for the shunt locomotive .  
 
5.2 Neither of the signal box operators on duty at the time was aware that they had wrong -routed 
the shunt locomotive , because they were unaware of the limitations of the single slip switch  
that prevented the shunt locomotive travelling along the chosen route.  
 
5.3 The error on the mimic screen was the result of a n equipment upgrade program me that had 
overlooked the single slip switch configuration and had not ensure d that  the new system was 
fully representative of the actual track layout.  
 
5.4 The signal box was not fitted with an  interlock , which  would have  prevent ed the signal  box 
operators  setting a n incorrect route for the shunt locomotive . 
 
5.5 The signalling system that recognised a potential conflict and kept the signals at stop was a 
further and final defence that  prevented the trains colliding.  
 
5.6 The vigilance of the driver s of the passenger train and the shunt locomotive resulted in both 
trains stopping before a collision occurred.

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 6 Safety issues  
6.1. The Commission identified two key safety issues:  
 the process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensure d that the mimic screen 
matched the physical track layout, and had not detect ed the absence of an interlock to 
prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration over which it  was not possible 
for rail traffic to travel  
 the signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment capabilit ies 
in the Wellington yard that they were controlling.

 7 Safety actions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an o perator to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
The signalling system  
7.2.1.  KiwiRail corrected the mimic display within 24 hour s of the event.  
7.2.2.  KiwiRail advised the Commission on 8 January 2018 that a method of interlocking points levers 
to prevent a reoccurrence had been installed in the Wellington signal box.  
Signal box personnel  
7.2.3.  KiwiRail  advised that since 1 May 2017 enhanced auditing procedures had been put in place 
for signal box personnel consistent with those  for train controllers.

 Final Report RO -2017 -102 8 Recommendations  
General  
8.1 The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to KiwiRail.  
8.2 In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurri ng in the future.  
8.3 KiwiRail's change management process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensure d 
that the mimic screen matched the physical track layout, and had not detect ed the absence of 
an interlock to prevent the signallers setting the poin ts to a configuration over which it  was not 
possible for rail traffic to travel.  
On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review 
KiwiRail 's change management processes for modifying existing and building new safety -critical 
systems , and ensure that these change management processes include a full failure mode 
effect analysis and require  functional test ing before the new or modified system s are put into 
service . (010/18)  
On 7 June 2018 , KiwiRail replied:  
In res ponse to recommendation 010/18 KiwiRail will add the following steps to the 
process for scoping, design and testing of significant changes to safety significant 
control systems:  
 At the scoping phase the identification of potential failure modes in consulta tion 
with stakeholders via a safety in design risk assessment;  
 Formal documentation of issues discovered and resulting changes undertaken 
throughthe testing process - this testing includes both technical and end -user;  
 Formal technical and user signoff before changes are released for 
implementation; and  
 A post implementation review and associated issues tracking to capture and 
resolve and residual issues.  
Functional testing of changes is already part of existing processes.  
8.4 Notwithstanding the fault in the mimic screen, the signallers had a surprising lack of familiarity 
with the physical layout of the yard they were controlling, particularly as one of the signallers 
had some 13 years' experience in the Wellington signal box.  The fact that no -one was aware 
that the mimic screen was not representative of the actual yard layout is an issue . 
On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review 
KiwiRail's system for training and ongoing  performance monitoring for signal box operators to 
ensure that they are fully familiar with the capabilities of the equipment and the layout  of the 
yards they are controlling.   (011/18)  
On 7 June 2018 , KiwiRail replied:  
In response to recommendation to 01 1/18 KiwiRail confirms that it has reviewed 
the system for training and ongoing performance monitoring for the signal box 
operators and has a programme of changes underway which are scheduled to be in 
place by the end of 2018.
