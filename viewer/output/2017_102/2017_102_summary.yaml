- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 40
  explanation: The accident was significantly influenced by human error and assumptions. Signaller B set the route for the shunt locomotive based on the mimic screen, which incorrectly displayed the route due to a 'single slip switch' configuration (3.2.8). Signaller A also gave verbal authority to the RCO to pass a red signal, assuming the signaling system would not provide a proceed signal because of the track fault (3.2.11). These actions demonstrate reliance on expected actions without verification and incorrect judgments based on incomplete information.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 30
  explanation: Situational awareness was compromised as the signallers did not have an accurate perception of the actual track configuration versus what was displayed on the mimic screen (3.2.8). Additionally, the RCO on the shunt locomotive had to stop and inform signaller A that the route had been incorrectly set, indicating a loss of situational awareness (3.2.12).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: There was a failure to adhere to safety procedures when signaller A gave verbal authority to the RCO to pass a red signal, which is not standard procedure without ensuring the route is correctly set and safe (3.2.11). This deviation from standard operating procedures contributed to the unsafe conditions.
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Communication breakdown played a role in the incident as the signallers' incorrect setting of the route was not effectively communicated to the RCO until the shunt locomotive was already on the wrong track (3.2.12). This lack of effective communication led to the near-miss situation.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There may have been a lack of familiarity with the specific track configuration, particularly the 'single slip switch', which did not allow for the route displayed on the mimic screen (3.2.8). This suggests that training and familiarity with the equipment could have been a contributing factor, although it is not explicitly stated.
