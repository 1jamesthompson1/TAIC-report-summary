- name: Communication and Coordination
  explanation: Effective communication and coordination between signallers and other personnel are crucial for safe railway operations. In this incident, there was a breakdown in communication and coordination, as evidenced by the fact that "Signaller A gave verbal authority to the RCO on the shunt locomotive to pass the red signal and proceed to the next red signal near the track fault" (3.2.11), based on the incorrect belief that the route was set correctly. Additionally, the maintainer confirmed with Signaller A that the points were in the correct position for the shunt locomotive to proceed (3.2.9), but this was not the case. The miscommunication and lack of proper coordination led to the shunt locomotive being incorrectly routed, which could have resulted in a collision.
- name: Signal and Point Operation
  explanation: The proper operation of signals and points is essential for directing trains safely along the correct routes. In this accident, the signal and point operation were compromised due to a track fault and a misunderstanding of the track layout. Signaller B, under the direction of Signaller A, set the route for the shunt locomotive, but due to the single slip switch configuration, the actual route did not correspond with the one displayed on the mimic screen (3.2.8). This discrepancy between the intended route and the actual track configuration directly contributed to the near-miss incident.
- name: Reliability of Signalling Equipment
  explanation: The reliability of signalling equipment, including mimic screens and track switches, is a fundamental aspect of railway safety. In this case, the mimic screen misled the signallers by displaying an incorrect route (3.2.8), which suggests a potential issue with the reliability or design of the signalling system. The fact that the actual configuration of the single slip switch did not allow for the route displayed on the mimic screen to be followed indicates a safety concern related to the signalling equipment's ability to accurately reflect the real-world track layout.
- name: Human Factors and Workload Management
  explanation: Human factors, such as workload and task distribution among signallers, can significantly impact railway safety. Signaller A was multitasking, handling telephone and radio communications with train drivers and maintenance staff (3.2.3), while also overseeing the signal operations. This high workload and the division of responsibilities may have contributed to the oversight in route setting and the subsequent miscommunication with the RCO (3.2.11). The incident underscores the importance of managing workload and ensuring that signallers can focus on critical tasks without being overburdened.
- name: Response to Unusual Situations
  explanation: The ability to respond effectively to unusual situations, such as equipment faults, is a key safety theme. The track fault observed by the signallers affected train movements (3.2.1), requiring manual operation of the points (3.2.2) and special handling of signal authorizations (3.2.11). The signallers' response to the track fault, including the decision to give verbal authority to bypass a red signal, played a role in the near-miss. This highlights the need for robust procedures and training for handling unexpected or non-standard operating conditions.
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Maintaining situational awareness is essential for railway safety, particularly for signallers who control train movements. In this incident, there was a lapse in situational awareness as the signallers were unaware that the route set for the shunt locomotive was incorrect due to the single slip switch configuration (3.2.8). The RCO's realization that the track he was on was leading to a different location (3.2.12) prevented a potential accident, indicating the critical role that situational awareness plays in identifying and mitigating risks.
