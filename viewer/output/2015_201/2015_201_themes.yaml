- name: Training and Familiarization
  explanation: The theme of training and familiarization is highly relevant to this accident as the master of the Kea was not properly trained in and familiar with the vessel's new propulsion control system. The Fullers training and familiarization system failed to ensure that the master was adequately prepared to operate the new system, which contributed to the collision. The master had limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various backup functions that could have been used to regain control of the Kea ("the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was properly trained in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5), "The master had not received adequate training on the Kea's new control system. He had a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various back-up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea" (5.3)).
- name: Control System Reliability
  explanation: Control system reliability is a central safety theme in this accident. The Kea was allowed to enter and continue service using a follow-up mode of operation despite known faults with that mode, which had already resulted in incidents. The Fullers system did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service, leading to the accident ("the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow-up mode of operation, despite the company knowing that there were faults with that mode that were resulting in incidents" (4.1.5), "The Kea should not have re-entered service with the follow-up mode of control active once it had been established that the system was faulty and unreliable" (5.4)).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  explanation: Risk assessment and management is a significant safety theme as Fullers did not perform a proper risk assessment to establish the risks associated with the control system's reliability issues, nor did they put in place measures to mitigate those risks. This oversight allowed the Kea to re-enter service with a faulty control system, which was a direct contributor to the accident ("No risk assessment was undertaken to establish what the risks were, and what could be put in place to mitigate the risks" (4.4.1), "Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service" (5.5)).
- name: Surveyor Oversight
  explanation: Surveyor oversight is another safety theme identified in this accident. Neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system. The lack of scrutiny by a surveyor during the replacement and commissioning of the critical control system could have provided an additional level of assurance regarding system reliability ("neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the kea's propulsion control system" (4.5 (invalid formatted quote)), "The Kea's propulsion control system was a critical system, the failure of which could have had serious consequences. The replacement of the whole control system should have been afforded a greater level of scrutiny by a surveyor" (5.6)).
- name: Audible and Visual Alarms
  explanation: The functionality and user interaction with audible and visual alarms is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The master relied on the audible alarm to confirm that a transfer of control had occurred, but was not aware that it would sound three times and stop, irrespective of whether the controls were accepted at the receiving control station. This led to a false belief that the transfer was successful, contributing to the loss of control over the starboard propulsion system ("He relied on the audible alarm to confirm that a transfer had occurred, but was not aware that it would sound three times (about 10 seconds) and stop, irrespective of whether or not the controls were accepted at the receiving control station" (4.3.6), "It is likely that the master believed he had control of the starboard propulsion by the unfortunate timing of the aural alarms" (5.2)).
- name: Passenger Safety Measures
  explanation: Passenger safety measures, specifically regarding the securing of passenger seating, is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The unsecured seats on the Kea contributed to the number and severity of injuries when the vessel collided with the wharf. Although not required by the maritime rules for the type of voyages the Kea was engaged in, securing the seats would have been a reasonable precaution to protect the safety of passengers ("Many passengers were thrown out of their seats and injured. A number of injuries were caused by unsecured seats landing on top of the passengers" (4.6.1), "Securing the seats to the deck would have been a well-considered precaution that would likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers" (5.7)).
