- name: Training and Familiarization
  explanation: The theme of training and familiarization is highly relevant to this accident as the master of the Kea was not properly trained in and familiar with the vessel's propulsion control system. The report states that "the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was properly trained in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5). Furthermore, the master had "a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various back-up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea" (5.3). This lack of adequate training and familiarity with the control system and its emergency procedures contributed to the master's inability to prevent the collision.
- name: Control System Reliability
  explanation: Control system reliability is a central safety theme in this accident, as the vessel was known to have faults with the follow-up mode of its propulsion control system, which had previously resulted in incidents. The report highlights that "the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow-up mode of operation, despite the company knowing that there were faults with that mode that were resulting in incidents" (4.1.5). The master's unsuccessful attempt to transfer control of the propulsion units, due to either not fully depressing the give-away button or a potential intermittent fault, directly led to the loss of control and subsequent collision (4.2.1, 4.2.5).
- name: Risk Management
  explanation: Risk management is a significant safety theme as Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service. The report finds that "Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service" (5.5). The company's failure to undertake a proper risk assessment when reliability issues with the control system were known, and the decision to reintroduce the vessel to service without resolving these issues, are indicative of inadequate risk management practices (4.4.1, 4.4.2).
- name: Surveyor Oversight
  explanation: Surveyor oversight is a pertinent safety theme as neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system. The report indicates that "neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5). The lack of scrutiny by a surveyor, especially given the critical nature of the control system and its known issues, represents a significant oversight that could have provided an additional level of assurance regarding system reliability (4.5.6, 4.5.9).
- name: Audible and Visual Alarms
  explanation: The functionality and use of audible and visual alarms are a safety theme in this accident, as the master relied on the audible alarm to confirm the transfer of control, which was misleading. The report notes that "it is likely that the master believed he had control of the starboard propulsion by the unfortunate timing of the aural alarms" (5.2). The master did not confirm the transfer with the visual indicators, and the design of the alarm system was such that it could stop sounding even if control had not been successfully transferred (4.2.6, 4.2.8). This reliance on insufficient alarm systems contributed to the master's incorrect belief that he had control of the vessel.
- name: Passenger Safety Measures
  explanation: Passenger safety measures, specifically regarding the securing of passenger seating, is a safety theme as the unsecured seats contributed to the injuries sustained by passengers during the collision. The report finds that "securing the seats to the deck would have been a well-considered precaution that would likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers" (5.7). The lack of a requirement to secure seats on a vessel with a transit time of less than 30 minutes, as in the case of the Kea, highlights a gap in safety measures that, if addressed, could have mitigated the harm to passengers (4.6.2, 4.6.4).
