The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safe ty.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  T he Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. The Kea was a double -ended  catamaran  passenger ferry operating a 15 minute service 
between downtown Auckland and Devonport on Auckland’s North Shore .  The vessel was fitted 
with a propulsion unit on t he forward end of the starboard hull and the aft end of the port hull 
and could be operated from the centre and starboard side of the wheelhouse. The entire 
control system for the propulsion units had been replaced with a similar control system less 
than f our months before the accident.  
1.2. At about 1030 on 17 February 2015, the Kea departed from the Auckland ferry terminal with 
61 passengers on board.  The master was the sole person on the bridge.  As the Kea 
approached Devonport ferry terminal at its full ser vice speed of 12 knots  (about 22 kilometres 
per hour) , the master transferred control of the two propulsion units from the vessel’s centre 
console to the starboard wing console in preparation for berthing.  
1.3. However, the control for only the port propulsion units transferred to the starboard wing 
console, which went unnoticed by the master.  
1.4. The master attempted to slow the ferry by manipulating the control lever for the starboard 
propulsion unit, and soon realised that the unit was not responding.  The master  made several 
unsuccessful attempts to gain control of the starboard propulsion unit.  
1.5. Realising that the Kea was fast approaching the ferry terminal, the master aborted the 
berthing and used the port propulsion unit in an attempt to turn the ferry away from the 
surrounding wharves and head back into the harbour.  He soon realised that he would  not be 
able to avo id a collision with an adjacent wharf, so used the port propulsion unit to slow the 
ferry.  The Kea struck the wharf at a speed of eight knots (about 16 kilometres per hour).  The 
starboard propulsion unit remained at full speed ahead throughout the sequen ce. 
1.6. The Kea sustained significant damage to its starboard hull above the waterline  and m any 
passengers received minor injuries.  Seven passengers were hospitalised with non -life-
threatening injuries.  
1.7. The Commission found  that it was about as likely as not that the master lost control of the 
starboard propulsion system because he did not fully press the ‘give -away’ button on the 
centre console before taking control at the wing console.  
1.8. The Commission also found  that the master had not been sufficiently train ed in and 
familiarised with the Kea’s new control system, and did not know how to use two other 
features that he could have used to prevent the collision.  
1.9. The Commission also found  that Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with 
the replac ement of the Kea’s propulsion control system and the vessel’s re -entry to service , 
and that the replacement project should have been afforded a greater level of regulatory 
scrutiny by a surveyor.  
1.10.  The Commission identified four safety issues : 
 the Fullers tr aining and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was 
properly trained in and familiar with the Kea’s propulsion control system  
 the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow -up 
mode of operation , despite  the company  knowing  that there were faults with that 
mode that were resulting in incidents  
 the regulatory system did not ensure an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the 
project to replace the Kea’s propulsion control system  
 Fullers had not asses sed the risk of operating ferries with unsecured passenger 
seating . 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201 1.11.  Fullers took safety actions  to address three of the safety issues. The Commission made one 
recommendation  to Maritime New Zealand to address the fourth.  
1.12.  The key lessons  arising from this  inquiry  were : 
 masters and other bridge crew must use all available means for monitoring the status 
of their manoeuvring and control systems, all the time, to maintain good situational 
awareness  
 masters must be properly trained in and fully familiar with all  aspects of their vessels ’ 
control systems and equipment before being allowed to take command of them  
 the regulatory requirements contained in Acts, Maritime Rules and other statutory 
instruments are minimum requirements with which  maritime operators must comply.  
They do not relieve operators of their responsibility to assess all risks in their 
operation s, and reduc e those risks to as low as reasonably practicable.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 17 February 2015 , the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission) learned 
through the media of an accident involving the passenger ferry  Kea at Victoria  Wharf,  
Devonport . 
2.2. The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13( 1)b of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in  charge.  
2.3. Two investigators from the Commission travelled to Auckland on the same day to conduct 
interviews and gather evidence.  
2.4. A questionnaire  was distributed to passengers on  board the ferry to gather further information 
on the accident.  
2.5. On 3 March 2015 , two investigators travelled to t he Fullers office in Auckland  to conduct 
further interviews and gather evidence . 
2.6. On 28 June 2017 , the Commission approved a draf t report for circulation to interested 
persons . 
2.7. The draft report was circulated to nine interested persons  and o ne submission was received.  
2.8. The Commission has considered in detail this submission and any changes as a result of this 
submission have  been included in the final report.  
2.9. The Commission approved  the report for publication on  23 August 2017.

 Final Report MO -2015 -201 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  Built i n 1988, the Kea was a commercial passenger ferry that conduct ed regular runs between 
Auckland ’s central business district  (CBD) and Devonport on Auckland’s North Shore .   
3.1.2.  In 2013 , the owner of the vessel  (Fullers Group Limited ) decided to replace  the Kea’s ageing 
propulsion and  steering control system .  Fullers awarded the contract to a Netherlands -based 
company  (ZF Marine ), which had manufacture d the original control system fitted on the Kea. 
3.1.3.  The contract  required the new control system to have a follow -up functionality , which was new 
in the scope of supply for ZF Marine .  It had not supplied a marine control system with follow -
up functionality  before .  Fullers was only made aware of this at the time of commissioning the 
new system.  
3.1.4.  The replacement of  the control system was discussed with a marine surveyor , and it was 
decided that within the meaning of Maritime Rules Part 44 the wo rk was not a major 
modification and  therefore  did not require the surveyor’s  supervision.  
3.1.5.  Work on  the new propulsion and steering control system was undertaken at Oceania Marine  
Limited ’s shipyard in Whāngārei between 15 August 2014 and 22 October 2014.  The Kea 
returned to service on 29 October  2014.

 3.2. The new p ropulsion and steering arrangement  
 
  
Figure 1 
Schematic diagram of  the Kea’s propulsion and steering control system  
3.2.1.  The Kea was a twin -hulled vessel with an identical bow1 and stern .2  Propulsion  and steering 
were  provide d by two azimuth thrusters ,3 one fitted on the forward end of the starboard hull 
and the other on  the aft end of the port hull.  The azimuth thrusters comprised a fixed -pitch 
propeller enclosed in a shroud that could be rotated 360 °. 
3.2.2.  Two sets  of identical steering control stations were  used  to drive the vessel  in either direction , 
without the need to turn around  off the berth . Each  control station had two control consoles4 
(see Figure 1) . Each console was fitted with a control lever and graphic display panel5 to 
operate the azimuth thruster unit s (see Figure 4).  Two control stations were  located on the 
                                                        
1 The bow is t he forward part of the hull of a ship . 
2 The stern is the back or  aft-most part of a ship . 
3 An azimuth thruster is a  type of marine propeller enclosed in a shroud that can be rotated to any horizontal 
angle, making a rudder unnecessary . 
4 The control console is used  to control each azimuth thruster . 
5 The graphic display panel was an 8.4 inch (21.3 cm) display panel . A number of operational parameters 
and alarms were  displayed on the panel .

 Final Report MO -2015 -201 forward side of the wheelhouse :6 Forward1  station and Wing1  station  (see Figure 1) .  Two 
stations on the aft side, Forward2  station and Wing2  station , were  located symmetrically 
opposite  and identical to the forward stations ( see Figure 2 ).  The Kea was normally controlled  
from the wing stations when manoeuvring  off the wharf .  Once clear of the wharf  the normal 
option was to transfer control to the forward control station on the centreline for better 
visibility and access to navigational equipment .  
 
Figure 2 
The Kea’s wheelhouse  layout  
3.2.3.  Each control station  was fitted with two control lever s, one for each azimuth thruster .  The 
lever s both controlled the propeller revolution speed  and rotat ed to control the thruster 
steering angle.  Each  console  had a graphic  display panel  showing various prop ulsion and 
steering parameters  (see Figure 4) .

Control station  layout   
3.3. Modes of operation  
3.3.1.  The control levers we re designed to be operated in f ollow - up7 mode , bumpless mode8 or the 
emergency non -follow -up9 mode .  To transfer control between control stations in either follow -
up mode or bumpless mode  the two levers on the receiving control station had to be aligned 
with those  of the active control station10 (from where the vessel was being controlled ).  In case 
of an emergency, the vessel could be operated using the emergency non-follow -up mode.   
3.3.2.  In follow -up mode , automation ensure d that all control levers on the bridge  followed and were  
always  aligned .  A transfer of control  was initiated  by pressing the ‘give -away’  control push  
button s on the active control station  (see Figure 5) .  Control could be transferred to any of the 
other three control stations on the bridge.   Pressing  the give -away button  trigger ed an audible 
alarm and a visual indication on the graphic  display panel s at all control station s.  To take 
control at the receiving control station , the ‘accept control’ push  button s (see Figure 4) had to 
be pressed , which  also stopped the audible and visual alarms .  This  indicat ed that the transfer 
was complete . The audible alarm sound ed three  times in a period of about 10 seconds and 
then stop ped for about 20 seconds before sounding again. This sequence continue d until the 
control transfer was cancelled or accepted.  
 
                                                        
7 The follow -up mode is a method of ste ering where all control levers on all stations automatically mirror the 
movements of the control levers on the active control station.  
8 The ‘bumpless mode’ is a method of steering where the levers on the inactive control stations do not 
automatically fol low the movements of the control levers on the active control station.  
9 A mode is available on e ach console on a vessel’s  control station to operate its steering and propulsion 
system as a back -up should the main ‘follow -up’ mode and bumpless mode of steering and propulsion 
control system fail . 
10 The active  control station  is the station  selected by the master of a vessel to operate the steering and 
propulsion unit of the vessel . 


<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201 3.3.3.  Control c ould also be transferred by manually aligning the levers on both stations prior to 
initiating the same transfer sequence.  This method was described in the control system 
manual as ‘bumpless control transfer’ . 
3.3.4.  At the time of the accident the master w as using the co ntrol system in the bumpless mode 
while technical issues  with the follow -up system  were being resolved by the manufacturer.

3.4. The refit  
3.4.1.  On 15 August 2014 , the Kea had travelled to Whāngārei for maintenance work at the Oceania 
Marine shipyard.  A number of repairs were to be undertaken during  the installation of the new 
control system.   
3.4.2.  The c omponents included eight Version1 control levers , which  were shipped from the 
Netherlands to New Zealand.  Prior to delivery , a ‘factory acceptance test’ of the new Version1 
control levers was performed in the Netherlands by ZF Marine.  The test found inconsistencies 
in the follow -up function and that the leve rs were not meeting the company’s quality 
standards.  It was decided to supply  the control system with Version1 levers and aim to 
replace them with improved Version2 levers at the time of commissioning.  
3.4.3.  Fullers undert ook the installation work and contract ed it to Oceania Marine.  The project was 
overseen by Fullers’ electrical team leader on behalf of the asset manager , who was busy with 
other projects.  The electrical team leader was a registered electrician who had been working 
for Fullers since 2000.  
3.4.4.  On 13 October  2014 , a ZF Marine engineer travelled to New Zealand to commission the new 
control system.  Only four Version2 control levers were available , but ZF Marine  intended to 
provide  the remaining four levers before the end of commissioning .  The compan y soon 
realised that it  would not be able to meet that deadline.

<< Page 9 >>
 3.4.5.  On 19  October 2014 , a series of harbour trials was carried out with the new control system.  
The trials were noted in ZF Marine ’s service report as being carried out to the satisfaction of 
the master.  The ZF Marine  engineer and the electrical team leader were also on board during 
the trials.  On completion of the trials  the master felt confident to sail the vessel from 
Whāngārei  to Auckland.  
3.4.6.  The master received training on the operation of th e new control s.  He said  it was not a 
formali sed instruction  but an interactive session with lots of questions and answers.   
3.4.7.  On 20 October 2014 , the commissioning work was completed.  The ZF Marine  service report 
noted that the follow -up mode s on the Forward1 and Forward2 control stations w ere not 
working properly.  Before countersigning the document, the electrical team leader contacted 
the asset manager , who instructed him to sign the document on his behalf if he was satisfied 
with the perfor mance and functional reliability of the new control system.  The document was 
signed and the vessel travelled back to Auckland on 22 October 2014.  
3.5. The return to service  
3.5.1.  When  the Kea returned to  Auckland , the master  instructed  other Kea masters  on the 
oper ation of the new control system .  
3.5.2.  The surveyor was invited to inspect the vessel and a ttend a sea trial.  As part of the sea trial 
he asked the master to operate the vessel in follow -up and non -follow -up mode .  The system 
performed without fault during this demonstration.  The surveyor was then satisfied that the 
vessel was safe to return to service.  The surveyor was not  provided with a copy of the ZF 
Marine  service report.  
3.5.3.  The Kea resumed commercial service on  29 October 2014 , but suffered a series  of control 
system failures related to the follow -up mode  of operation.  
3.5.4.  For example , on 2 November 2014 , the Wing2 control station’s follow -up function stopped 
responding while the vessel was underway.  The master us ed the emergency non -follow -up 
controls to berth the vessel.  
3.5.5.  Following this incident the vessel was removed from commercial service.   On 8 November 
2014 , ZF Marine  engineers replaced the four remaining Version1 control levers with Version2 
control levers.  Sea trials were conducted , but the control levers again failed in follow -up 
mode. Fullers decided to continue operating the vessel in follow -up mode while ZF Marine  
engineers developed a third version of the control lever.  
3.5.6.  The vessel resumed normal servic e on 12 November 2014.  The vessel suffered a control 
system failure the same day.  On 20 November 2014 , the vessel suffered two further in -
service failures related to the follow -up mode  of the control system.  The Kea was again 
removed from service.  
3.5.7.  Fullers conducted a risk assessment and decided that it would disable the faulty follow -up 
function on the control system whil e continuing to operate the vessel.  
3.5.8.  Fullers issued a memorandum to all Kea masters and duty managers on 21 November 2014 
(see Appendix 1 for the full memorandum).  The main instructions outlined in the 
memorandum were:  
 All vessel control to be done from the wing position  
 Follow -up function not to be reinstated under any circumstances unless 
agreed by the Asset Manager  
 Additional  watch keeping crew to be available to the master should they be 
requested  
 Any ‘givea -way’ or ‘accept control’ to be done with plenty of sea room 
available unless tied alongside at Devonport or Downtown Ferry Basin  
 Any future control issues to be recorded in vessel log  

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201  Only experienced masters who have been instructed in the use of the 
controls in the manual position to be in command of the vessel.  
3.5.9.  A senior Kea master subsequently requested that masters be allowed to transfer control to 
the forward control  station because of poor visibility from the wing station.  On 25 November 
2014 , Fullers  released a second memorandum , revising the first bullet point in the original 
memorandum to read:  
 Central Controls may be used between Auckland and Devonport, however 
wing control position must be resumed about abeam of the naval dry dock 
on the Auckland -Devonport  (route) and between Captain Cook and Queens 
Wharf on the Devonport -Auckland (route) . 
3.6. Narrative  
3.6.1.  At about 0430 on 17 February 2015, the master  and two crew mem bers boarded the Kea and 
started preparing the vessel for its regular service betw een Auckland ’s CBD and Devonport.  
3.6.2.  The master  was designated a relief master, qualified to operate  the Kea when a permanent 
master  was unavailable.  
3.6.3.  The master  followed the checklist and  tested the propulsion and steering control system from  
the wheelhouse , and confirmed that it was working properly prior to departure .  In accordance 
with the revised memorandum , he was using the Kea’s control system with the follow -up mode 
disabled.  The c hange  over between consoles was made using the bumpless mode.  
3.6.4.  The vessel departed at about 0545 from the Auckland ferry terminal on the first run of the 
day. 
 
Figure 5

3.6.5.  For the first couple of runs prior to sunrise, the relief master controlled the ferry from the wing 
stations.  Shortly after sunrise the master decided to transfer control to the centre control 
stations afte r clearing the harbour basin , to avoid being blinded by sun -strike through the 
starboard wheelhouse window.  
3.6.6.  At about 1030 , the Kea departed from the Auckland ferry terminal with 61 passengers on 
board and came up to full speed when it clear ed the basin.  

Final Report MO -2015 -201 
<< Page 11 >>
 3.6.7.  Once the vessel was up to speed and heading toward s Devonport, the master  transferred 
control  from the Wing1 control stati on to the Forward1  control station .  
3.6.8.  In the vicinity of Devonport Naval Base the master initiated the  transfer process from the 
Forwar d1 station back to  the Wing1  control station in preparation for arrival at the Devonport 
ferry terminal.   The Kea was still travelling at full speed at that time.  
3.6.9.  The master  pressed the give -away button next to ea ch control lever and heard the audible 
alarm sound as he walked over to press the accept -control button s on the Wing1  control 
station.   At about th at time the audible alarm stopped  sounding . The master  believed t hat the 
transfer had been  successful and that he now had control of  both azimuth th rusters from the 
Wing1  station.   He did not look at the status of each control lever to confirm that this was the 
case.  
3.6.10.  The vessel proceeded a further 100 metres towards Devonport before the master  decided to 
reduce the rev olution s on the engine s.  The master  heard the sound of the port azimuth 
thruster engine  reduce and  assumed  that both  azimuth  thrusters  had slowed  down.  
3.6.11.  He then rotate d the lever controlling the starboard thruster  to initiate a braking manoeuvre .  
He was expecting a reduction in  vesse l speed , but soon realised  that the starboard azim uth 
thruster was not responding  and that he had neither steering nor speed control over the 
starboard thruster . 
3.6.12.  The master  went back and forth between the two control stations , but did not succeed  in 
regain ing control of the starboard azimuth thruster .  
3.6.13.  Realising that the vessel was fast approaching the Devonport ferry terminal , he decided to 
abort berthing  and used the port thruster to alter  course to starboard in an attempt to turn 
and head back to open wa ter.   
3.6.14.  However,  there was not enough room to execute the turn using the port thruster alone .  The 
master soon realised that a collision with Devonport ’s Victoria  Wharf was imminent and 
reversed the port thruster to reduce the speed of the vessel.  
3.6.15.  Shortly after wards  the vessel’s starboard bow collided  with a concrete pile on Victoria  Wharf.

3.6.16.  The master  was preoccupied and had no time to make an announcement on the public 
address system warning  pass engers of an imminent collision . 
3.6.17.  A number of passengers  were thrown  forward  onto the deck .  In some areas , the plastic seats 
on which they were sitting were not secured  and toppled during the collision . 
3.6.18.  Soon after impact t he deckhand carr ied out an internal assessment of the hull and confirmed 
that the damaged area was above the waterline.

3.6.19.  About a minute after impact, the master  was able to regain control of both engines and 
manoeuvred the vessel to the Devonport passenger terminal  where emergency services were 
waiting  to provide assistance .

 Final Report MO -2015 -201 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  When the Kea collided  with Victoria  Wharf it was a little over three  months since the vessel 
had resumed service with a new propulsion and steering control system .   
4.1.2.  During that time the control levers had faulted in the follow -up mode on several  occasions , 
resulting in  a number of incidents.  When Fullers  purchased the new  control system , a key  
requirement was a follow -up capability , in which  all levers on all control stations constantly 
follow ed the lever in control.   When the Kea departed Oceania Marine’s shipyard to travel to 
Auckland and resume commercial service , the o wner was  aware of reliability issues with some 
of the control lever s. 
4.1.3.  A senior master had received informal training from the manufacturer’s engineers at the time 
of commissioning and had  then  been  entrusted with training other masters who operated the 
Kea.  The lack of a structured training programme is discussed in the following analysis.  
4.1.4.  Also discussed is the level of  surveyor  and company oversight and Fullers ’ response to the 
recurring control  system -related incidents.  
4.1.5.  The Commission has identified the following safety issues , which are discussed in this section :  
 the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was 
properly trained in and familiar with the Kea’s propulsion control system  
 the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow -up 
mode of operation , despite  the company knowing that there were faults with that mode 
that were resulting in incidents  
 neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an  appropr iate level of surveyor oversight 
of the project to replace the Kea’s propulsion control system  
 Fullers had not assessed the risk of operating ferries with unsecured passenger seating . 
4.2. The collision  
4.2.1.  The Kea was travelling at full speed on the approach to Devonport Wharf when the  master 
attempted  to transfer control of the propulsion units from the Forward1 control station to the 
Wing1 control station.  He succeeded in transferring control of the port propuls ion unit, but not 
the starboard unit.  I mportantly, he was unaware that he did not have control of the starboard 
propulsion unit until the Kea had entered a confined area with limited room to turn away or 
stop in time to avoid a collision.  
4.2.2.  There are three  scenarios that might explain why control of the starboard propulsion unit was 
not achieved:  
 the master did not fully depress the give -away  button for the starboard control lever  
 the control levers for the starboard propulsion unit on the two consoles were not aligned 
when he attempted to transfer control  
 some form of mechanical or electrical fault prevented the transfer.  
4.2.3.  No mechanical or electrical fault could be found or replicated that would have prevent ed the 
transfer of contro I, so it  is therefore unlik ely to have been the cause.  However, the possibility 
that some intermittent fault occurred could not be excluded.  
4.2.4.  If the starboard thruster control levers on the Forward1 control station and the Wing1 control 
station were not aligned at the time of transf er, the transfer of control would not have been 
achieved.  This was a prerequisite for the successful transfer of control between the two 
stations.  The master was confident that the levers at both consoles were aligned in their 
normal change  over position s, dead ahead and maximum thrust.  This is therefore unlikely to 
have been the reason for the transfer not being achieved . 
Final Report MO -2015 -201 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.2.5.  It is about as likely as not that the master did not push the give -away button with sufficient 
force to initiate the transfer.  The transfer button was beneath a flexible , plastic , water -
resistant shield, which had to be depressed with sufficient force to push/click the underlying 
button .  During subsequent trials it was found possible to not activate the underlying button if 
the push was not hard enough or off -centre.  
4.2.6.  Each give -away button on each console was equipped with an audible alarm that sound ed 
when the button  was pressed to initiate a transfer sequence.  Normally,  a failure to push a 
button properly would not activate the tra nsfer alarm.  However, it was standard practice to 
press both give-away  buttons simultaneously .  If one button was pushed correctly and the 
other was not, one alarm would sound , but it would not be recognisable that the other did not 
because the two alarms  were indistinguishable from each other . 
4.2.7.  The audible alarm was supplemented  by a flashing visual indicat or on the graphic display 
panel .  The audible  alarm sounded three times  in a period of about 10 seconds , then stopped, 
irrespective of whether  or not  control had been accepted  at the receiving control station .  After 
a further 20 seconds t he alarm sequence was repeated until the control tr ansfer procedure 
was cancelled or  accepted at the receiving control station.   
4.2.8.  When the master  initiated the transfe r sequence, he heard the audible alarm but did not 
confirm that the visual indicator s were flashing .  When he walked over to the Wing 1 control 
station and pushed the accept -control button, he heard the audible alarm stop but did not 
check the  graphic display panel to confirm that the transfer  had taken place.   Tests show ed 
that it took about 10 seconds  to press the give-away  button on the Forward1  control station  
and accept control at the Wing1 control station , which  was the same duration as the audible 
alarm  before it stopped for a further 20 seconds .  This is likely to have led the master to 
believe that the transfer of both thruster units had been successful . 
4.2.9.  The incident highlights the importance of masters using all available cues to identify positively 
or confirm the status of the propulsion system.   This is discussed further in the following 
section on training . 
4.2.10.  Since the accident , the Kea has been fitted w ith eight  new control levers and incorporated 
modifications to reduce the risk of a control system failure.  The audible alarms have also 
been modified to sound continuously until control is assumed at the receiving control station.  
Finding s  
1. It is about a s likely as not  that the master lost control of the starboard 
propulsion system because he did not fully press the ‘give -away’ button on the 
centre console before taking control at the wing console .  
2. It is likely that the master believed he  had control of the starboard propulsion 
by the unfortunate  timing  of the aural alarms.  However, the visual displays on 
the wing  console before him would have shown that he did not have control of 
the starboard propulsion system .  
4.3. Training  
Safety issue: the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure  that the master 
was properly trained  in and familiar with the Kea’s propulsion control system.  
4.3.1.  The master had been working for Fullers since 2011 and held an inshore launch Mast er 
Certificate of Competency.  He had been  signed  off to drive the Kea in 2012 using the 
previous control system.  
4.3.2.  In the six months prior to the accident he had carried out nine shifts on the Kea.  His last shift 
had been on 21 December 2014, 58 days before  the accident.  By comparison, regular 
masters had averaged about 49 shifts in the previous six months.   

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201 4.3.3.  After the new control system had been fitted the relief master had spent one day together with 
two other masters  undergoing  training in how to operate  the new control system.  He had been  
shown how to operate the follow -up mode and carried out some practical exercises.  There 
was no sign -off documentation to indicate his level of competency.   
4.3.4.  On 18 November 2014 , he had operated the Kea for the first t ime using the new control 
system in follow -up mode.  However, following a memorandum dated 25 November 2014 (see 
Appendix 2), he had to familiarise himself with transferring control without the follow -up 
function, which he felt was quite a different proced ure.  
4.3.5.  He had spent less time operating and familiarising himself with the new control system than 
other masters, and had a limited understanding of the information available to him on the 
graphic display panels  on the consoles.  He was  also unfamiliar  with the emergency steering 
and shut -down mechanisms for the propulsion systems in the event of an emergency.  
4.3.6.  When the follow -up function was disabled the master was required to transfer controls using 
the bumpless mode, a mode that he was even less famili ar with.  He relied on the audible 
alarm to confirm that a transfer had occurred , but was not aware that it would sound three  
times (about 10 seconds) and stop , irrespective of whether  or not  the controls were accepted 
at the receiving control station.  
4.3.7.  Just prior to the accident, when the skipper  realised that he had no control of the starboard 
thruster, there were two emergency procedures he could have used to avert or reduce the 
impact of the collision.  The first was using the emergency non -follow -up mo de, and if that 
failed he could have  used  the emergency stop button to shut down the starboard thruster .  
The master was unfamiliar with both systems and as a result they were not used.  
4.3.8.  To better understand why a skipper was in charge of the Kea with such a limited knowledge of 
the propulsion control system, it is necessary to review the company ’s training system.  
4.3.9.  Until April 2014, Fullers had employed a marine manager who, among other things, was 
responsible for the training and development of marine personnel and for monitoring and 
enhancing safety standards.  Part of his day -to-day responsibilities was manag ing the marine 
sign-off11 process.   
4.3.10.  The marine manager position was disestablished as a result of restructuring ( see Appendix 3 
for the new organisational chart).  The marine manager’s  responsibilities were dispersed 
among other managers .  Fullers was unable  to provide  documentation that clearly indicate d 
who was in charge of crew training and development  under the new structure .  As a result, 
there was no structured training programme to ensure that  the Kea’s crew were competent 
and signed off to operate the new control system.  
4.3.11.  When the Kea refit was completed the operations manager, who managed the rostering of 
crew, had assigned a senior Kea master to take the vessel back to Auckland.  
4.3.12.  The master had familiari sed himself with the new system with assistance from a ZF Marine 
technician and t he electrical team leader , who demonstrated and explained how the new 
control system worked.  However, the training was ad hoc and it was unclear to what extent 
the master  fully understood the safety systems.  There was no training syllabus or induction 
plan to confirm the quality of  the training he received.  
4.3.13.  Once the vessel was back in Auckland, the senior master had been  tasked with training other 
Kea masters on the functionality of the new control system , even though he was not the 
designated training master.  Other masters received training in the same informal manner 
without any clear training strategy, performance objectives or testing to ensure that they 
thoroughly understood the operation of the contr ol system.  
                                                        
11 Confirming that a crew member has met the training, development and operat ional requirements to 
undertake a particular task.  
Final Report MO -2015 -201 
<< Page 17 >>
 4.3.14.  According to the memorandum released by Fullers , only experienced masters instructed in the 
use of the controls in manual mode should have been  in command of the vessel.  The skipper 
in command of the Kea when the accident occurred did not have a lot of  experience on board 
the Kea. He had not had sufficient instruction  in operating the vessel in the non -follow -up 
(bumpless) mode , and was not sufficiently familiar with the intricacies  of the  entire propulsion 
control system.  
4.3.15.  When this accident occ urred, Fullers ’ system for training and signing off skippers lacked the 
processes and clarity of responsibilities to give effect to the memorandum that it had 
released.  
 Finding  
3. The master had not receive d adequate training on  the Kea’s new control 
system.   He had a limi ted understanding of the system ’s functionality and the 
various back -up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea.  
4.4. Risk 
Safety issue:  the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the 
follow -up mode of operation , despite the company knowing that there were faults with that 
mode that could (and did ) result in incidents.  
4.4.1.  Right from the time the Kea was reintroduced to service , Fullers had been  awar e that there 
were reliability issues with the control levers and therefore  a risk of the control system 
malfunctioning in the follow -up mode.  No risk assessment was undertaken to establish what 
the risks were, and what could be put in place to mitigate th e risk s. 
4.4.2.  Even when the Kea began having incidents caused by the malfunction of the control system in 
the follow -up mode, and was withdrawn from service, it was twice reintroduced to service 
before a proper risk assessment had been  undertaken .  
4.4.3.  Only after t he third occasion  of the Kea being  withdrawn from service did Fullers undertake a 
formal risk assessment, which resulted in the only logical action  – to prohibit the use of the 
follow -up mode until its reliability had been proven.   
4.4.4.  Operating the Kea using the non-follow -up (bumpless ) mode was an acceptable and safe 
method of operation , provided the master  was familiar with operating the vessel in this mode 
and had adequate  training and guidelines to operate the vessel safely.  Many other vessels 
operate with similar systems.  That decision should have been made when the Kea first re -
entered service after the new control system had been installed and it was known to be faulty.  
4.4.5.  Fullers was the operator and as such had the respons ibility of managing all risks in its 
operation.  This is a fundamental requirement it has under maritime rules for safe ship 
management systems.  It has this responsibility regardless of any regulatory intervention.  
Finding s  
4. The Kea should not have re -entered service with the follow -up mode of control 
active once it had been established that the system was faulty and unreliable.  
5. Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of 
the Kea’s propulsion control system and the vessel ’s re-entry to service .  
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201 4.5. Surveyor Intervention  
Safety issue: neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an  appropriate level of surveyor 
oversight of the project to replace the Kea’s propulsion control system.  
4.5.1.  Maritime Rules Part 19 requires commercial marine operators t o have  Maritime Transport 
Operator C ertificate s for their maritime operation s and Certificate s of Survey issued by 
recognised surveyor s for all vessel s in the ir operation s. 
4.5.2.  Fullers received its Maritime Transport Operator Certi ficate  from Maritime New Zealand on 16 
January  2015 .  To maintain this certificate,  it was  required to comply with all relevant Maritime 
Rules . Maritime  Rule s Part 19 and P art 44 detail the responsibilities of maritime  transport 
operator s and surveyors.  
4.5.3.  Maritime Rule s Part 44 prescribes the requirements for the survey , certification and 
maintenance of ships operated  under Maritime Transport Operator Certificates.  It require s a 
surveyor who undertakes a survey of a major modification to assess the degree and nature of 
the risk s associated with the modification and satisfy themselves  that the modified equipment 
is fit for purpose.  
4.5.4.  Part 44 defines  ‘major modification ’ as: 
an alter ation or modification  of a ship , including the replacement , remov al, or 
addition of any part of a ship  that is likely to  
(a) significantly affect the struct ural integrity , tonnage, freeboard, cargo or 
passenger capacity, crew or passenger accommodation, conditions of 
assignment of load line, watertight subdivision, stabil ity, or structural fire 
protection; or  
(b) result in significant changes to the propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery, 
or steering or the method of propulsion of the ship:  
4.5.5.  Further , Maritime Rules Part 19 state s that a Certificate of S urvey issued for a vessel only 
remai ns valid if any major modification  to the vessel has been app roved by a recognised 
surveyor.  
4.5.6.  When Fullers decided to replace the existing control system , its understanding was that the 
new ZF M arine control system was a ‘like for like ’ with the existing system and did not 
consider the pr oject a ‘major modification’.   The project involved the complete dismantling of 
the existing propulsion control system , including propulsion interfaces, hardware and cabling.  
The new control system was built by the same manufacturer and provided the same  function  
as the existing system .  However, it was a completely new control system with different 
components and interfaces  with the propulsion units . 
4.5.7.  The former asset manager approached a surveyor with m any years’  experience in surveying 
Fullers vessels  and informed him of its decision to replace the Kea’s control system with a 
‘like for like ’ system .  The surveyor did not consider himself an expert on control system s.  He 
decided that the new system was not a major modification that would require his involvement 
throughout the project.  H e was told that a reputable marine electronics firm was installing the 
new system and that the equipm ent ma nufacturer was going to oversee its commissioning .  
4.5.8.  It was ther efore reasonable for him to not be involved at every step of the installation project.  
It is a matter of interpretation whether under Maritime Rule s Part 44 the project met the 
criteria of a major modification, or if it was in fact a modification at all.  Regardless of whether 
it was or not, the control system is a critical system, the failure of which could have  serious 
consequences.  It was therefore appropriate that a surveyor be at least involved in the 
commissioning of the system, including the sea trials.  
4.5.9.  As mentioned in previous sections, Fullers ’ rigour preceding its acceptance of the Kea from 
the manufacturer  could have been better .  An independent surveyor’s involvement in this 
process would have introduced another level of scrutiny to the syste m reliability, particularly if 
Final Report MO -2015 -201 
<< Page 19 >>
 the surveyor had been privy to the information from the manufacturer’s commissioning report 
that there were reliability issues with the control levers that were installed.  
Finding  
6. The Kea’s propulsion control system was a cr itical system, the failure of which 
could have had serious consequences.  The replacement of the whole control 
system should have been afforded a greater level of scrutiny  by a surveyor . 
4.6. Safety of passengers  
Safety issue : Fullers had not assessed the risk of operating ferries with unsecured passenger 
seating . 
4.6.1.  The master  did not make any announcements  on the public address system before the vessel 
collided with a concrete pile at Victoria Wharf.  Most p assengers were therefore unaware of 
the imminent collision and did not know to brace themselves .  Many passengers  were thrown 
out of their seats and injur ed.  A number of injuries were caused by  unsecured seats landing 
on top of the passengers.  
4.6.2.  Maritime Rules Part 40A.18 prescribe s the requirements for seating in passenger  
accommodation spaces. The rule states that : 
A ship that engages in voyages of 30 minutes’  duration or more must be 
equipped with seating for every passenger that the ship is certified to carry, in 
accordance with  this rule.  
4.6.3.  The Kea took about 15 minutes to complete a single transit between Auckland and Devonport 
and therefore this part of the rule was not applicable.  The rule does not require seats to be 
secured on  board a vessel , and in the Kea’s case there was no requirement to have a seat for 
every passenger.   
4.6.4.  The base of  each  seat on  the Kea was capable of being secured to the deck.  G iven the 
operator ’s responsibility to take all reasonable precautions to protect the safety of passengers 
and crew , securing the seats would have been a well -considered precaution that would likely 
have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers.  
4.6.5.  Since the accident , Fullers has carried out a risk assessment  of its  fleet and mitigated this risk 
by securing seating on all of its ferries .  
Finding  
7. Securing the seats to the deck would have been a well -considered precaution 
that would likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to 
passengers.  
 
  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -201 5. Findings  
5.1. It is about as likely as not that the master lost control of the starboard propulsion system 
because he did not fully press the ‘give-away ’ button on the centre console before taking 
control at the wing console.  
5.2. It is likely that the master believed  he had control of the starboard propuls ion by the 
unfortunate timing of the aural alarms.  However, the visual displays on the wing console 
before him would have shown that he did not have control of the starboard propulsion system.  
5.3. The master had not receive d adequate training on  the Kea’s new  control system.  He had a 
limited understanding of the system ’s functionality and the various back -up functions he could 
have used to regain control of the Kea. 
5.4. The Kea should not have re -entered service with the follow -up mode of control active once it 
had been established that the system was faulty and unreliable.  
5.5. Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea’s 
propulsion control system and the vessel’s re -entry to service.  
5.6. The Kea’s propulsion control system was a critical system, the failure of which could have had 
serious consequences.  The replacement of the whole control system should have been 
afforded a greater level of scrutiny by a surveyor.  
5.7. Securing the seats to the deck would have been a well -considered precaution that would likely 
have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Below is a  summary of mitigating steps  taken by Fullers following the Kea collision  incident. 
They  have been classified into three categories: Personnel and Training, Vessel System s and 
Safety Management System.  
Personnel  and Training  
Enhanced training regime established for the MV Kea, and across Fullers.  
Appointment of a dedicated training Master for Kea to ensure consistency and 
quality of training. This person was put through a formal training assessment unit 
standard and assisted the development of the training regime.  
All Kea training material was comprehensively reviewed and new requirements 
were put in place in order to establish complete and comprehensive 
understanding of the vessel specific systems, including the requirement for the 
Master to complete a full task book on all vessel systems prior to assuming 
command and Including the enhanced  requirement to demonstrate proficiency in 
the use of all three vessel emergency back -up systems.  
Comprehensive review and enhancement of vessel manuals and instructions 
with easy to follow decision trees for the activation of emergency overrides, these

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recom mendations have been issued to Maritime New Zealand . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendatio n  
7.3. Maritime Rule s Part 44 prescribes the requirements for the survey , certification and 
maintenance of ships operated under Maritime Transport Operator Certificate s.  The rule 
requires that a surveyor assess the scope of any proposed work on  board a vessel  and, if they 
consider it to be a major modification, undertake a survey of the work, assess the degree and 
nature of the risk s associated with the modification and satisfy themselves  that the modified 
equipment is fit for purpose . 
It is a matter of interp retation whether under Maritime Rule s Part 44 the project to replace the 
Kea’s control system met the criteria of a major modification, or if it was in fact a modification 
at all.  Regardless of whether it was or not, the control system is a critical syste m, the failure of 
which could have  serious consequences.  It was therefore appropriate for a surveyor to have 
at least been involved in the commissioning of the system, including the sea trials.  
On 23 August 2017 , the Commission recommended that Maritime New Zealand issue 
guidance and advice to  operators and  surveyors about  the need to take a risk -based approach 
when determining the level of surveyor oversight  required  for changes to critical systems, 
regardless of  whether or not the changes are considered major modifications.  (026/17)  
7.3.1.  On 13 September 2017  Maritime New Zealand replied:  
I write in response to your letter of 23 August 2017 in which you set out the final 
recommendation on the above inquiry and ask that  I inform you of Maritime New 
Zealand's intentions in respect to the same.  
The Commission has recommended that Maritime New Zealand issue guidance 
and advice to operators and surveyors regarding the need to take a risk -based 
approach when determining the level of surveyor oversight required for changes 
to critical systems, regardless of whether those changes are considered major 
modifications.  
I agree that maritime operators taking a risk -based approach to surveyor 
oversight of changes to critical systems  is a sound approach. I also agr ee that a 
similar approach is a ppropria te for the work of surveyors.  
I am advised that, because of the way that Maritime Rules Parts 44 and 19 are 
constructed, the issuance of such guidance may not achieve the intended effec t. 
That is because they do not define 'critical systems' and they only require 
surveyor oversight and approval in the event of a major repair or a major 
modification.  
It is my view that the more enduring way of achieving the objective identified by 
the Co mmission is to review the legal framework to support a risk -based  
approach to surveyor oversight . This would require amendments to Rule Parts 19 
and 44; in particular,  the addition of a definition of 'critical systems' and clarity as 
to the point at which surveyor oversight is required in the process of critical 
system changes.  
Maritime New Zealand currently has a programme of work on its current 
regulatory programme which is well suited to consider this matter at some depth 
and may result in a proposal to  change the rules, subject to Ministerial 
agreement. As the Commission may appreciate, if changes to the rules are 
required, this process could take a couple of years to complete.

 Final Report MO -2015 -201 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Masters and other bridge crew must use all available means for monitoring the status of their 
manoeuvring and control systems, all the time, to maintain good situational awareness.  
8.2. Masters must be properly trained in and fully familiar with all aspects of their vessels ’ control 
systems and equipment before b eing allowed to take command of them . 
8.3. The regulatory requirements contained in Acts, Maritime Rules and other statutory 
instruments are minimum requirements with which  maritime operators must comply.  They do 
not relieve o perators of their  responsibility to assess all risks in the ir operation s, and reduc e 
those risks to as low as reasonably practicable.
