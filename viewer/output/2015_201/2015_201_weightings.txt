","0.0","8.333","The master's assumption that he had successfully transferred control of the propulsion units, despite not verifying this with the visual indicators, represents a human error and assumption that contributed to the accident (4.2.8, 4.2.9).
","5.774","30.0","The report identifies a significant lack of adequate training for the master on the Kea's new control system. The master had a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various backup functions that could have been used to regain control of the Kea (4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.3.14, 4.3.15). This lack of training directly contributed to the inability to prevent or mitigate the collision, making it a major factor in the accident.
","0.0","23.333","The master's unfamiliarity with the emergency steering and shutdown mechanisms for the propulsion systems in the event of an emergency was a contributing factor to the accident (4.3.5, 4.3.7). This indicates that not only was the training inadequate, but the master also lacked hands-on experience and familiarity with the new equipment, which is critical for safe operation, especially in emergency situations.
","2.887","1.667","There is no mention of issues related to Crew Resource Management contributing to the accident in the report.
","2.887","8.333","The master did not confirm the visual indicators were flashing when transferring control of the propulsion units, and he did not check the graphic display panel to confirm that the transfer had taken place (4.2.8). This lack of adherence to safety procedures contributed to the master's incorrect belief that he had successfully transferred control, leading to the collision.
","5.774","8.333","The disestablishment of the marine manager position and the lack of clarity on who was responsible for crew training and development under the new structure indicate issues with the organizational safety culture at Fullers (4.3.9, 4.3.10). This contributed to the absence of a structured training program and the master's inadequate preparation for operating the new control system.
","2.887","15.0","Fullers failed to undertake a proper risk assessment when reliability issues with the control system were known, and the Kea was allowed to enter and continue service using the follow-up mode despite known faults (4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.5). This lack of risk management and analysis was a significant oversight that allowed the vessel to operate under unsafe conditions.
","5.0","5.0","The report suggests that there was insufficient surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system (4.5.1-4.5.9). Although it is a matter of interpretation whether the replacement was a major modification requiring more rigorous surveyor involvement, the critical nature of the control system warranted greater scrutiny, which was not enforced by regulatory oversight.
","0.0","0.0","While situational awareness is critical, the report does not specifically cite a loss of situational awareness as a contributing factor to the accident. The master's actions seem to be more related to training and familiarity with the equipment.
","0.0","0.0","There is no direct mention in the report of a lack of emergency response preparedness contributing to the accident. The master's unfamiliarity with emergency procedures is covered under training and familiarity with equipment.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not indicate that maintenance and inspection regimes were a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","While the report discusses issues with the control system, it does not specifically attribute the accident to the use of automation or over-reliance on automated systems.
