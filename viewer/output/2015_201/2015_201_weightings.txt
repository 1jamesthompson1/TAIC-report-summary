","0.0","1.667","There is no evidence in the document suggesting that communication breakdowns or crew resource management failures were factors in the accident.
","2.887","28.333","The document indicates that the master had not received adequate training on the Kea's new control system and had a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various back-up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea (4.3.3, 4.3.15). This lack of training and preparedness for emergency procedures significantly contributed to the accident.
","2.887","16.667","The Kea had known reliability issues with the control levers, and Fullers was aware of these issues when the vessel resumed service (4.1.2). However, there is no direct mention of maintenance procedures and compliance contributing to the accident, but the presence of known issues suggests a potential link to maintenance practices.
","5.774","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems were not mentioned as contributing factors in the accident.
","0.0","11.667","Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service (4.4.5, 5.5). This indicates a lack of compliance with safety management practices.
","2.887","13.333","The master's lack of awareness that he did not have control of the starboard propulsion unit until it was too late contributed to the collision (4.2.1, 4.2.9). This indicates a failure in maintaining situational awareness.
","5.774","5.0","The design of the control system, specifically the follow-up mode and the give-away button, played a role in the accident (4.2.5, 4.2.6). However, the primary issue was the training and understanding of the equipment rather than its design.
","0.0","15.0","Fullers' failure to undertake a proper risk assessment when reliability issues with the control system were known, and the subsequent decision to continue using the follow-up mode, contributed to the accident (4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3).
