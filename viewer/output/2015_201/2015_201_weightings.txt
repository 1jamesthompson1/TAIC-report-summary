","0.0","10.0","The master's situational awareness was compromised due to his unfamiliarity with the new control system and the lack of confirmation of the visual indicators during the transfer of control (""4.2.8"", ""4.2.9"").
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document that the master was engaged in non-essential activities that could have diverted his attention from controlling the vessel at the time of the accident.
","0.0","18.333","Human error played a significant role in the accident, as the master likely did not press the 'give-away' button with sufficient force, and there was a lack of error management in confirming the transfer of control (""4.2.5"", ""4.2.6"", ""4.2.8"").
","2.887","16.667","The organizational influences and safety culture at Fullers were lacking, as evidenced by the inadequate training and familiarization system, and the absence of a structured training program for the new control system (""4.3"", ""4.3.15"").
","2.887","5.0","Communication issues were present, particularly the indistinguishable audible alarms and the master's failure to use all available cues to confirm the status of the propulsion system (""4.2.6"", ""4.2.9"").
","0.0","20.0","The master's lack of training and preparedness for emergency procedures was a significant factor, as he was not familiar with the emergency steering and shutdown mechanisms that could have averted or reduced the impact of the collision (""4.3.5"", ""4.3.7"").
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information on emergency response planning and coordination as a factor in the accident.
","0.0","6.667","There is no indication that maintenance procedures and compliance were an issue in the accident, as the focus was on the new control system's reliability and the crew's familiarity with it.
","5.774","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems are not mentioned as a factor in the accident.
","0.0","10.0","Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service, indicating issues with regulatory compliance and safety management (""4.4"", ""4.5"").
","0.0","6.667","The design and specifications of the new control system were a factor, as the follow-up mode was known to be faulty and unreliable, yet the vessel was allowed to enter service with this mode active (""4.4.1"", ""4.4.4"").
","2.887","6.667","Fullers' failure to perform a risk assessment when reliability issues with the control levers were known contributed to the accident (""4.4.1"", ""4.4.2"").
