  4.1.1.  When the Kea collided  with Victoria  Wharf it was a little over three \
  \ months since the vessel \nhad resumed service with a new propulsion and steering\
  \ control system .   \n4.1.2.  During that time the control levers had faulted in\
  \ the follow -up mode on several  occasions , \nresulting in  a number of incidents.\
  \  When Fullers  purchased the new  control system , a key  \nrequirement was a\
  \ follow -up capability , in which  all levers on all control stations constantly\
  \ \nfollow ed the lever in control.   When the Kea departed Oceania Marine's shipyard\
  \ to travel to \nAuckland and resume commercial service , the o wner was  aware\
  \ of reliability issues with some \nof the control lever s. \n4.1.3.  A senior master\
  \ had received informal training from the manufacturer's engineers at the time \n\
  of commissioning and had  then  been  entrusted with training other masters who\
  \ operated the \nKea.  The lack of a structured training programme is discussed\
  \ in the following analysis.  \n4.1.4.  Also discussed is the level of  surveyor\
  \  and company oversight and Fullers ' response to the \nrecurring control  system\
  \ -related incidents.  \n4.1.5.  The Commission has identified the following safety\
  \ issues , which are discussed in this section :  \n\uF0B7 the Fullers training\
  \ and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was \nproperly trained\
  \ in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system  \n\uF0B7 the Fullers\
  \ system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow -up \nmode\
  \ of operation , despite  the company knowing that there were faults with that mode\
  \ \nthat were resulting in incidents  \n\uF0B7 neither the operator nor the surveyor\
  \ ensured an  appropr iate level of surveyor oversight \nof the project to replace\
  \ the Kea's propulsion control system  \n\uF0B7 Fullers had not assessed the risk\
  \ of operating ferries with unsecured passenger seating . \n4.2. The collision \
  \ \n4.2.1.  The Kea was travelling at full speed on the approach to Devonport Wharf\
  \ when the  master \nattempted  to transfer control of the propulsion units from\
  \ the Forward1 control station to the \nWing1 control station.  He succeeded in\
  \ transferring control of the port propuls ion unit, but not \nthe starboard unit.\
  \  I mportantly, he was unaware that he did not have control of the starboard \n\
  propulsion unit until the Kea had entered a confined area with limited room to turn\
  \ away or \nstop in time to avoid a collision.  \n4.2.2.  There are three  scenarios\
  \ that might explain why control of the starboard propulsion unit was \nnot achieved:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the master did not fully depress the give -away  button for the starboard\
  \ control lever  \n\uF0B7 the control levers for the starboard propulsion unit on\
  \ the two consoles were not aligned \nwhen he attempted to transfer control  \n\uF0B7\
  \ some form of mechanical or electrical fault prevented the transfer.  \n4.2.3.\
  \  No mechanical or electrical fault could be found or replicated that would have\
  \ prevent ed the \ntransfer of contro I, so it  is therefore unlik ely to have been\
  \ the cause.  However, the possibility \nthat some intermittent fault occurred could\
  \ not be excluded.  \n4.2.4.  If the starboard thruster control levers on the Forward1\
  \ control station and the Wing1 control \nstation were not aligned at the time of\
  \ transf er, the transfer of control would not have been \nachieved.  This was a\
  \ prerequisite for the successful transfer of control between the two \nstations.\
  \  The master was confident that the levers at both consoles were aligned in their\
  \ \nnormal change  over position s, dead ahead and maximum thrust.  This is therefore\
  \ unlikely to \nhave been the reason for the transfer not being achieved . \nFinal\
  \ Report MO -2015 -201 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.2.5.  It is about as likely as not that\
  \ the master did not push the give -away button with sufficient \nforce to initiate\
  \ the transfer.  The transfer button was beneath a flexible , plastic , water -\n\
  resistant shield, which had to be depressed with sufficient force to push/click\
  \ the underlying \nbutton .  During subsequent trials it was found possible to not\
  \ activate the underlying button if \nthe push was not hard enough or off -centre.\
  \  \n4.2.6.  Each give -away button on each console was equipped with an audible\
  \ alarm that sound ed \nwhen the button  was pressed to initiate a transfer sequence.\
  \  Normally,  a failure to push a \nbutton properly would not activate the tra nsfer\
  \ alarm.  However, it was standard practice to \npress both give-away  buttons simultaneously\
  \ .  If one button was pushed correctly and the \nother was not, one alarm would\
  \ sound , but it would not be recognisable that the other did not \nbecause the\
  \ two alarms  were indistinguishable from each other . \n4.2.7.  The audible alarm\
  \ was supplemented  by a flashing visual indicat or on the graphic display \npanel\
  \ .  The audible  alarm sounded three times  in a period of about 10 seconds , then\
  \ stopped, \nirrespective of whether  or not  control had been accepted  at the\
  \ receiving control station .  After \na further 20 seconds t he alarm sequence\
  \ was repeated until the control tr ansfer procedure \nwas cancelled or  accepted\
  \ at the receiving control station.   \n4.2.8.  When the master  initiated the transfe\
  \ r sequence, he heard the audible alarm but did not \nconfirm that the visual indicator\
  \ s were flashing .  When he walked over to the Wing 1 control \nstation and pushed\
  \ the accept -control button, he heard the audible alarm stop but did not \ncheck\
  \ the  graphic display panel to confirm that the transfer  had taken place.   Tests\
  \ show ed \nthat it took about 10 seconds  to press the give-away  button on the\
  \ Forward1  control station  \nand accept control at the Wing1 control station ,\
  \ which  was the same duration as the audible \nalarm  before it stopped for a further\
  \ 20 seconds .  This is likely to have led the master to \nbelieve that the transfer\
  \ of both thruster units had been successful . \n4.2.9.  The incident highlights\
  \ the importance of masters using all available cues to identify positively \nor\
  \ confirm the status of the propulsion system.   This is discussed further in the\
  \ following \nsection on training . \n4.2.10.  Since the accident , the Kea has\
  \ been fitted w ith eight  new control levers and incorporated \nmodifications to\
  \ reduce the risk of a control system failure.  The audible alarms have also \n\
  been modified to sound continuously until control is assumed at the receiving control\
  \ station.  \nFinding s  \n1. It is about a s likely as not  that the master lost\
  \ control of the starboard \npropulsion system because he did not fully press the\
  \ 'give -away' button on the \ncentre console before taking control at the wing\
  \ console .  \n2. It is likely that the master believed he  had control of the starboard\
  \ propulsion \nby the unfortunate  timing  of the aural alarms.  However, the visual\
  \ displays on \nthe wing  console before him would have shown that he did not have\
  \ control of \nthe starboard propulsion system .  \n4.3. Training  \nSafety issue:\
  \ the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure  that the master\
  \ \nwas properly trained  in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system.\
  \  \n4.3.1.  The master had been working for Fullers since 2011 and held an inshore\
  \ launch Mast er \nCertificate of Competency.  He had been  signed  off to drive\
  \ the Kea in 2012 using the \nprevious control system.  \n4.3.2.  In the six months\
  \ prior to the accident he had carried out nine shifts on the Kea.  His last shift\
  \ \nhad been on 21 December 2014, 58 days before  the accident.  By comparison,\
  \ regular \nmasters had averaged about 49 shifts in the previous six months.   \n\
  \n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2015 -201 4.3.3.  After the new control system\
  \ had been fitted the relief master had spent one day together with \ntwo other\
  \ masters  undergoing  training in how to operate  the new control system.  He had\
  \ been  \nshown how to operate the follow -up mode and carried out some practical\
  \ exercises.  There \nwas no sign -off documentation to indicate his level of competency.\
  \   \n4.3.4.  On 18 November 2014 , he had operated the Kea for the first t ime\
  \ using the new control \nsystem in follow -up mode.  However, following a memorandum\
  \ dated 25 November 2014 (see \nAppendix 2), he had to familiarise himself with\
  \ transferring control without the follow -up \nfunction, which he felt was quite\
  \ a different proced ure.  \n4.3.5.  He had spent less time operating and familiarising\
  \ himself with the new control system than \nother masters, and had a limited understanding\
  \ of the information available to him on the \ngraphic display panels  on the consoles.\
  \  He was  also unfamiliar  with the emergency steering \nand shut -down mechanisms\
  \ for the propulsion systems in the event of an emergency.  \n4.3.6.  When the follow\
  \ -up function was disabled the master was required to transfer controls using \n\
  the bumpless mode, a mode that he was even less famili ar with.  He relied on the\
  \ audible \nalarm to confirm that a transfer had occurred , but was not aware that\
  \ it would sound three  \ntimes (about 10 seconds) and stop , irrespective of whether\
  \  or not  the controls were accepted \nat the receiving control station.  \n4.3.7.\
  \  Just prior to the accident, when the skipper  realised that he had no control\
  \ of the starboard \nthruster, there were two emergency procedures he could have\
  \ used to avert or reduce the \nimpact of the collision.  The first was using the\
  \ emergency non -follow -up mo de, and if that \nfailed he could have  used  the\
  \ emergency stop button to shut down the starboard thruster .  \nThe master was\
  \ unfamiliar with both systems and as a result they were not used.  \n4.3.8.  To\
  \ better understand why a skipper was in charge of the Kea with such a limited knowledge\
  \ of \nthe propulsion control system, it is necessary to review the company 's training\
  \ system.  \n4.3.9.  Until April 2014, Fullers had employed a marine manager who,\
  \ among other things, was \nresponsible for the training and development of marine\
  \ personnel and for monitoring and \nenhancing safety standards.  Part of his day\
  \ -to-day responsibilities was manag ing the marine \nsign-off11 process.   \n4.3.10.\
  \  The marine manager position was disestablished as a result of restructuring (\
  \ see Appendix 3 \nfor the new organisational chart).  The marine manager's  responsibilities\
  \ were dispersed \namong other managers .  Fullers was unable  to provide  documentation\
  \ that clearly indicate d \nwho was in charge of crew training and development \
  \ under the new structure .  As a result, \nthere was no structured training programme\
  \ to ensure that  the Kea's crew were competent \nand signed off to operate the\
  \ new control system.  \n4.3.11.  When the Kea refit was completed the operations\
  \ manager, who managed the rostering of \ncrew, had assigned a senior Kea master\
  \ to take the vessel back to Auckland.  \n4.3.12.  The master had familiari sed\
  \ himself with the new system with assistance from a ZF Marine \ntechnician and\
  \ t he electrical team leader , who demonstrated and explained how the new \ncontrol\
  \ system worked.  However, the training was ad hoc and it was unclear to what extent\
  \ \nthe master  fully understood the safety systems.  There was no training syllabus\
  \ or induction \nplan to confirm the quality of  the training he received.  \n4.3.13.\
  \  Once the vessel was back in Auckland, the senior master had been  tasked with\
  \ training other \nKea masters on the functionality of the new control system ,\
  \ even though he was not the \ndesignated training master.  Other masters received\
  \ training in the same informal manner \nwithout any clear training strategy, performance\
  \ objectives or testing to ensure that they \nthoroughly understood the operation\
  \ of the contr ol system.  \n                                                  \
  \      \n11 Confirming that a crew member has met the training, development and\
  \ operat ional requirements to \nundertake a particular task.  \nFinal Report MO\
  \ -2015 -201 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.3.14.  According to the memorandum released by\
  \ Fullers , only experienced masters instructed in the \nuse of the controls in\
  \ manual mode should have been  in command of the vessel.  The skipper \nin command\
  \ of the Kea when the accident occurred did not have a lot of  experience on board\
  \ \nthe Kea. He had not had sufficient instruction  in operating the vessel in the\
  \ non -follow -up \n(bumpless) mode , and was not sufficiently familiar with the\
  \ intricacies  of the  entire propulsion \ncontrol system.  \n4.3.15.  When this\
  \ accident occ urred, Fullers ' system for training and signing off skippers lacked\
  \ the \nprocesses and clarity of responsibilities to give effect to the memorandum\
  \ that it had \nreleased.  \n Finding  \n3. The master had not receive d adequate\
  \ training on  the Kea's new control \nsystem.   He had a limi ted understanding\
  \ of the system 's functionality and the \nvarious back -up functions he could have\
  \ used to regain control of the Kea.  \n4.4. Risk \nSafety issue:  the Fullers system\
  \ allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the \nfollow -up mode of operation\
  \ , despite the company knowing that there were faults with that \nmode that could\
  \ (and did ) result in incidents.  \n4.4.1.  Right from the time the Kea was reintroduced\
  \ to service , Fullers had been  awar e that there \nwere reliability issues with\
  \ the control levers and therefore  a risk of the control system \nmalfunctioning\
  \ in the follow -up mode.  No risk assessment was undertaken to establish what \n\
  the risks were, and what could be put in place to mitigate th e risk s. \n4.4.2.\
  \  Even when the Kea began having incidents caused by the malfunction of the control\
  \ system in \nthe follow -up mode, and was withdrawn from service, it was twice\
  \ reintroduced to service \nbefore a proper risk assessment had been  undertaken\
  \ .  \n4.4.3.  Only after t he third occasion  of the Kea being  withdrawn from\
  \ service did Fullers undertake a \nformal risk assessment, which resulted in the\
  \ only logical action  - to prohibit the use of the \nfollow -up mode until its\
  \ reliability had been proven.   \n4.4.4.  Operating the Kea using the non-follow\
  \ -up (bumpless ) mode was an acceptable and safe \nmethod of operation , provided\
  \ the master  was familiar with operating the vessel in this mode \nand had adequate\
  \  training and guidelines to operate the vessel safely.  Many other vessels \n\
  operate with similar systems.  That decision should have been made when the Kea\
  \ first re -\nentered service after the new control system had been installed and\
  \ it was known to be faulty.  \n4.4.5.  Fullers was the operator and as such had\
  \ the respons ibility of managing all risks in its \noperation.  This is a fundamental\
  \ requirement it has under maritime rules for safe ship \nmanagement systems.  It\
  \ has this responsibility regardless of any regulatory intervention.  \nFinding\
  \ s  \n4. The Kea should not have re -entered service with the follow -up mode of\
  \ control \nactive once it had been established that the system was faulty and unreliable.\
  \  \n5. Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement\
  \ of \nthe Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel 's re-entry to service\
  \ .  \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report MO -2015 -201 4.5. Surveyor Intervention\
  \  \nSafety issue: neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an  appropriate\
  \ level of surveyor \noversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control\
  \ system.  \n4.5.1.  Maritime Rules Part 19 requires commercial marine operators\
  \ t o have  Maritime Transport \nOperator C ertificate s for their maritime operation\
  \ s and Certificate s of Survey issued by \nrecognised surveyor s for all vessel\
  \ s in the ir operation s. \n4.5.2.  Fullers received its Maritime Transport Operator\
  \ Certi ficate  from Maritime New Zealand on 16 \nJanuary  2015 .  To maintain this\
  \ certificate,  it was  required to comply with all relevant Maritime \nRules .\
  \ Maritime  Rule s Part 19 and P art 44 detail the responsibilities of maritime\
  \  transport \noperator s and surveyors.  \n4.5.3.  Maritime Rule s Part 44 prescribes\
  \ the requirements for the survey , certification and \nmaintenance of ships operated\
  \  under Maritime Transport Operator Certificates.  It require s a \nsurveyor who\
  \ undertakes a survey of a major modification to assess the degree and nature of\
  \ \nthe risk s associated with the modification and satisfy themselves  that the\
  \ modified equipment \nis fit for purpose.  \n4.5.4.  Part 44 defines  'major modification\
  \ ' as: \nan alter ation or modification  of a ship , including the replacement\
  \ , remov al, or \naddition of any part of a ship  that is likely to  \n(a) significantly\
  \ affect the struct ural integrity , tonnage, freeboard, cargo or \npassenger capacity,\
  \ crew or passenger accommodation, conditions of \nassignment of load line, watertight\
  \ subdivision, stabil ity, or structural fire \nprotection; or  \n(b) result in\
  \ significant changes to the propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery, \nor steering\
  \ or the method of propulsion of the ship:  \n4.5.5.  Further , Maritime Rules Part\
  \ 19 state s that a Certificate of S urvey issued for a vessel only \nremai ns valid\
  \ if any major modification  to the vessel has been app roved by a recognised \n\
  surveyor.  \n4.5.6.  When Fullers decided to replace the existing control system\
  \ , its understanding was that the \nnew ZF M arine control system was a 'like for\
  \ like ' with the existing system and did not \nconsider the pr oject a 'major modification'.\
  \   The project involved the complete dismantling of \nthe existing propulsion control\
  \ system , including propulsion interfaces, hardware and cabling.  \nThe new control\
  \ system was built by the same manufacturer and provided the same  function  \n\
  as the existing system .  However, it was a completely new control system with different\
  \ \ncomponents and interfaces  with the propulsion units . \n4.5.7.  The former\
  \ asset manager approached a surveyor with m any years'  experience in surveying\
  \ \nFullers vessels  and informed him of its decision to replace the Kea's control\
  \ system with a \n'like for like ' system .  The surveyor did not consider himself\
  \ an expert on control system s.  He \ndecided that the new system was not a major\
  \ modification that would require his involvement \nthroughout the project.  H e\
  \ was told that a reputable marine electronics firm was installing the \nnew system\
  \ and that the equipm ent ma nufacturer was going to oversee its commissioning .\
  \  \n4.5.8.  It was ther efore reasonable for him to not be involved at every step\
  \ of the installation project.  \nIt is a matter of interpretation whether under\
  \ Maritime Rule s Part 44 the project met the \ncriteria of a major modification,\
  \ or if it was in fact a modification at all.  Regardless of whether \nit was or\
  \ not, the control system is a critical system, the failure of which could have\
  \  serious \nconsequences.  It was therefore appropriate that a surveyor be at least\
  \ involved in the \ncommissioning of the system, including the sea trials.  \n4.5.9.\
  \  As mentioned in previous sections, Fullers ' rigour preceding its acceptance\
  \ of the Kea from \nthe manufacturer  could have been better .  An independent surveyor's\
  \ involvement in this \nprocess would have introduced another level of scrutiny\
  \ to the syste m reliability, particularly if \nFinal Report MO -2015 -201 \n<<\
  \ Page 19 >>\n the surveyor had been privy to the information from the manufacturer's\
  \ commissioning report \nthat there were reliability issues with the control levers\
  \ that were installed.  \nFinding  \n6. The Kea's propulsion control system was\
  \ a cr itical system, the failure of which \ncould have had serious consequences.\
  \  The replacement of the whole control \nsystem should have been afforded a greater\
  \ level of scrutiny  by a surveyor . \n4.6. Safety of passengers  \nSafety issue\
  \ : Fullers had not assessed the risk of operating ferries with unsecured passenger\
  \ \nseating . \n4.6.1.  The master  did not make any announcements  on the public\
  \ address system before the vessel \ncollided with a concrete pile at Victoria Wharf.\
  \  Most p assengers were therefore unaware of \nthe imminent collision and did not\
  \ know to brace themselves .  Many passengers  were thrown \nout of their seats\
  \ and injur ed.  A number of injuries were caused by  unsecured seats landing \n\
  on top of the passengers.  \n4.6.2.  Maritime Rules Part 40A.18 prescribe s the\
  \ requirements for seating in passenger  \naccommodation spaces. The rule states\
  \ that : \nA ship that engages in voyages of 30 minutes'  duration or more must\
  \ be \nequipped with seating for every passenger that the ship is certified to carry,\
  \ in \naccordance with  this rule.  \n4.6.3.  The Kea took about 15 minutes to complete\
  \ a single transit between Auckland and Devonport \nand therefore this part of the\
  \ rule was not applicable.  The rule does not require seats to be \nsecured on \
  \ board a vessel , and in the Kea's case there was no requirement to have a seat\
  \ for \nevery passenger.   \n4.6.4.  The base of  each  seat on  the Kea was capable\
  \ of being secured to the deck.  G iven the \noperator 's responsibility to take\
  \ all reasonable precautions to protect the safety of passengers \nand crew , securing\
  \ the seats would have been a well -considered precaution that would likely \nhave\
  \ reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers.  \n4.6.5.  Since the\
  \ accident , Fullers has carried out a risk assessment  of its  fleet and mitigated\
  \ this risk \nby securing seating on all of its ferries .  \nFinding  \n7. Securing\
  \ the seats to the deck would have been a well -considered precaution \nthat would\
  \ likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to \npassengers.  \n \n\
