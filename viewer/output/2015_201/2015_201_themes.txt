Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of proper training and familiarization with the new propulsion control system: The master and other crew members did not receive adequate training on the functionality of the new control system, leading to a limited understanding of its operation and backup functions.

2. Failure to assess and manage risks associated with the replacement of the control system: Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system, including the decision to continue using the faulty follow-up mode despite knowing about its reliability issues.

3. Inadequate surveyor oversight: Neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight during the project to replace the control system, leading to a lack of scrutiny and potential oversight of critical system reliability.

4. Lack of passenger safety measures: Fullers did not assess the risk of operating ferries with unsecured passenger seating, resulting in injuries to passengers during the collision. Securing the seats to the deck could have reduced the number and severity of injuries.
