- name: Bridge Resource Management
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Alam Seri, the standard of BRM was not in accordance with good industry practice. The pilot, master, and bridge team had not discussed the pilot's intended actions to execute the passage plan, and no challenge parameters had been set to guide the bridge team on when they should challenge the pilot's actions ("The standard of bridge resource management was not in accordance with good industry practice" (4.6)). This lack of communication and planning could have contributed to the incident as the bridge team was not prepared to effectively monitor and respond to the vessel's progress against the passage plan.
- name: Pilot Training and Proficiency
  explanation: Pilot training and proficiency are critical for ensuring that pilots have the necessary skills and knowledge to safely navigate vessels in specific pilotage areas. The report indicates that the pilot was seven months overdue for a required annual assessment of proficiency, meaning South Port's pilot assessment regime for the Bluff pilotage area was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan ("The pilot was seven months overdue for a required annual assessment of proficiency" (4.10)). This safety theme is relevant because the lack of up-to-date training and proficiency assessment could have affected the pilot's performance and decision-making during the incident.
- name: Use of Electronic Navigational Aids
  explanation: Electronic navigational aids, such as Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) and Portable Pilot Units (PPUs), enhance situational awareness and provide real-time information on a vessel's position and predicted movements. The Alam Seri was not fitted with an ECDIS at the time of the incident, and the pilot was not using a PPU, which could have provided valuable information during the transit ("the only real-time means available to the bridge team for determining the vessel's exact movements were radar and visual navigation" (3.31)). The absence of these aids likely reduced the bridge team's situational awareness and their ability to respond effectively to the developing situation ("The bridge team's situational awareness, particularly during the recovery manoeuvres, would likely have been improved had there been an electronic chart display and information system or a portable pilot unit in use at the time of the incident" (4.9)).
- name: Environmental Conditions and Vessel Manoeuvrability
  explanation: Environmental conditions, such as wind and current, can significantly impact a vessel's manoeuvrability. In the case of the Alam Seri, the wind was from the east-southeast at a strength of about 25 knots, gusting to 32 knots, which acted on the starboard side of the vessel and affected its heading and ability to turn ("The wind acted on the starboard side of the vessel" (3.11)). The vessel's manoeuvrability was further compromised by a reduction in engine speed, which reduced the effectiveness of the rudder ("a reduction in engine speed reduced the effectiveness of the rudder to a point where the rudder could not overcome the turning moment created by strong wind acting on the starboard side of the ship" (4.1)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the challenges faced by the vessel in maintaining its intended course under the prevailing environmental conditions.
- name: Readiness of Critical Standby Equipment
  explanation: The readiness of critical standby equipment, such as anchors, is essential for emergency situations where immediate action is required to prevent an accident. In this incident, when the order was given to let go the port anchor, it did not deploy as expected, and multiple attempts were needed to release the starboard anchor ("when the order was given to let go the port anchor, the brake was released and the anchor did not deploy" (3.50)). This issue is relevant because the failure of the anchors to deploy promptly could have affected the outcome of the emergency response and the ability to prevent the vessel from grounding.
- name: Adherence to Safety Management Systems
  explanation: Safety management systems are designed to establish procedures and controls to manage risks and ensure safe operations. The report indicates that South Port's safety management system had measures in place for pilot training and proficiency, but these were not being met as required by the training manual ("meaning South Port's pilot assessment regime for the Bluff pilotage area was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan" (4.10)). This theme is relevant because the lack of adherence to the established safety management system could have contributed to the incident by allowing gaps in pilot proficiency and training to go unaddressed.
