Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Environmental conditions: The report mentions that the prevailing winds were from the east, which was not usual for the port. The wind direction and strength, along with the sustained wind and sea conditions, may have contributed to the incident.
2. Vessel maneuverability: The wind acting on the starboard side of the vessel caused the stern to move to port, resulting in the vessel veering to starboard. The reduction in engine speed and propeller wash past the rudder further reduced the vessel's maneuverability.
3. Bridge resource management: The level of bridge resource management on the bridge did not meet industry good practice. There was a lack of communication and teamwork among the bridge team, and no specific pilot plan or monitoring parameters were in place to address the weather conditions and deviations from the plan.
4. Pilot training and proficiency: The pilot was overdue for an annual assessment of proficiency, indicating that South Port's pilot assessment regime was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan.
5. Readiness of critical standby equipment: The anchors did not deploy when ordered by the pilot, and it could not be established why they failed to do so. The operator's safety management system categorized the anchor windlasses as critical standby equipment, but the cause of the malfunction could not be determined.
6. Electronic navigational aids: The absence of electronic charting and information aids, such as ECDIS or portable pilot units, limited the bridge team's situational awareness and ability to predict the vessel's movements and stay within safe navigation zones.
