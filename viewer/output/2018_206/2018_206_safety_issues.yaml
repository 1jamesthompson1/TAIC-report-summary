- The level of bridge resource management on the bridge did not meet industry good practice. The bridge team could not effectively monitor the execution of the pilotage because they did not have an agreed specific pilot plan, or agreed monitoring parameters appropriate to the weather conditions at the time.
- Pilot currency and proficiency assessments were not implemented as required by South Port's pilot training and proficiency plan.
