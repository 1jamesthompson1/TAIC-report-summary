  \ failure contribut ed to this incident . \n3.2 The environmental conditions when\
  \ the Alam Seri  was inbound to Bluff Harbour were  \nnot usual for the port, but\
  \ were not exceptional either . The prevailing winds for the \nport are from the\
  \ southwest quarter . On this occasion the wind  was from the east  and \nhad been\
  \ blowing from th at direction for  several days prior.  \n3.3 Numerous similar\
  \ inward transits  have been successfully made , by Bluff pilots,  in \neasterly\
  \ conditions over the years . Similar transits have also been successfully practi\
  \ sed \nin a simulator  environment . \n3.4 There was nothing unusual about  the\
  \ Alam Seri 's manoeuvring  characteristics . The \nvessel  had a standard configuration\
  \ like many other similar -sized bulk carriers . While \nthe conditions were challenging\
  \ , the ship should have been capable of maki ng the \nentrance without incident\
  \ in the conditions on the day . \n3.5 The following section  analyses the circumstances\
  \ surrounding the event to identify the  \nfactors that increased the likelihood\
  \ of the event occurring or increased the severity of \nits outcome. It also examines\
  \ a  safety issue that had the potential to adversely affect \nfuture operations.\
  \  \nContact with the s eabed  \n3.6 On 2 December 2018 a dive company conducted\
  \ an underwater inspection of the Alam \nSeri's hull at T \u012Bwai Point. The diver\
  \ inspected from the bottom of the hull to the first \nmetre of the flat side for\
  \ the entire length of the vessel.  \n3.7 The inspection was record ed on video\
  \ by the diver. A subsequent report described \nfresh scrapes on the flat bottom\
  \ of the vessel at positions approximately 20 m and 30 \nm from the bow. The largest\
  \ of these scrapes was 2  m by 0.4 m  and, in places, down to \nbare steel. Additionally,\
  \ th e diver found two small scrapes approximately 8 m along the \nbottom of the\
  \ stern tube. The largest of these scrapes was 0.1 m by 0.1 m. No cracks or \ndents\
  \ were evident  and there was no damage that affected the vessel's seaworthiness\
  \ . \n3.8 The Alam Seri's passage  plan used a program that predicted high water\
  \ at 1907 local \ntime, at a height of 2.62 m. The same tidal prediction program\
  \ estimated a height of tide of 2.60 m at 1930. The tide predictions published by\
  \ Land Information New \nZealand predicted high water at  1857 local time, at a\
  \ height of 2.70 m. The closest \ncharted depth to where the Alam Seri was brought\
  \ to a halt measured 6.40 m which \nmeant that at the time of the incident and the\
  \ location where the Alam Seri halted, \nthere was a depth of approximately 9.0\
  \ 0 m to 9.10 m.  \n3.9 The Alam Seri's draughts measured 8.76 m forward and 9.27\
  \ aft and so a mean \ndraught of 9.02 m. Given the draughts in relation to the available\
  \ depth of water at the time of the incident, it is very likely that the fresh scrapes\
  \ found during the diver's \nunderwater hull inspection were caused by the vessel\
  \ contacting the seabed during this incident.  \n \n  Final Report MO -2018- 206\
  \ \n<< Page 15 >>\n Vessel manoeuvrability  \nWind  \n3.10 When the Alam Seri  transited\
  \ Number 1 Reach, the engine was set on full ahead and \nthe speed through the water\
  \ was about 8.5 knots . The wind  was fro m the east-south -\neast at a strength\
  \ of about 25 knots, gusting to 32 knots27 and the vessel's heading \nwas approximately\
  \ 031\xB0 , almost at right  angles to the wind direction . \n3.11 The wind act\
  \ ed on the starboard side of the vessel , and with the accommodation block  \n\
  located  aft there was a greater surface area aft of the vessel's pivot point for\
  \ the  wind \nto act on (see Figure 9).  This caused the tendency of the stern to\
  \ move to port and the \nheading of the vessel  to change to starboard , commonly\
  \ referred to as 'rounding up \ninto the wind ' (see Figure 10) . This tendency\
  \ for the ship to veer to starboard  was \ncountered  by the  helmsman applying\
  \ port  rudder to maintain  the courses  ordered by  \nthe pilot (see Figure 11\
  \  and Appendix 2 ). \n3.12 The port helm required to maintain the course along\
  \ N umber 1 Reach appear ed to go \nunnoticed by the bridge team (other than the\
  \ helmsman)  or at least there was no \ndiscussion  among them about how it  might\
  \ affect the manner in which the port turn \ninto N umber 2 Reach would be made.\
  \  \n \nFigure 9: Profile of a typical loaded bulk carrier showing the relative\
  \ positions of a beam wind \ninfluence and the vessel's pivot point when moving\
  \ ahead  \n \n3.13 At about 1920 the pilot ordered half ahead on the engine and\
  \ a bout one minute later \nordered hard to port to commence making the 40 -degree\
  \ turn into  Number 2 Reach.  \nWhen the helmsman reported that the vessel 's head\
  \ was passing through 020 \xB0 the \npilot ordered  the helm to be put to amid ships\
  \ , the engine speed to be reduced further \nto slow ahead, and then the helm to\
  \ be put hard  to starboard . The pilot's intention was \nto slow the rate of turn\
  \ to port in prepa ration  for steadying up on the new course for \nNumber 2 Reach.\
  \ As soon as the helmsman re ported that the rudder was hard to \nstarboard , the\
  \ pilot ordered  the helmsman to  steady up on a new heading of 352 \xB0 to \n \n\
  \ \n27 Wind data provided by NIWA (the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric\
  \ Re search) to South Port, \nrecorded at Number 3 beacon in the harbour entrance\
  \ channel.  These wind speeds were verified by cross -\nchecking the wind speed\
  \ data captured by the vessel's instruments and saved on its voyage date recorder.\
  \  \nNOT TO SCALE  \n \n  Final Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 16 >>\n transit along\
  \ Number 2 Reach. The swing to port halted and the vessel steadied up for \nabout\
  \ t en seconds before a swing to s tarboard  developed . The helmsman applied port\
  \ \nhelm to counter the swing to starboard.  \n3.14 The two successive engine reductions\
  \ had two effects: they  reduced  the s peed  of the \nvessel (see Appendix 2 )\
  \ and they reduced the propeller wash past the rudder, thereby \nreducing the rudder's\
  \ effect iveness . As the vessel approached the new heading of 352\xB0, \nthe force\
  \ of the wind was acting more on the starboard quarter28. The wind 's effect of\
  \ \npushing the stern to port was therefore slightly reduced , but so too  was the\
  \ water flow \nover the rudder .  \n \n \nFigure 10: The change in manoeuvring influences\
  \ when the Alam Seri altered course into  \nNumber 2 Reach  \n3.15 The result was\
  \ that when the helmsman attempted to steady the vessel 's head on 352\xB0 , \n\
  they found that even with the rudder almost hard to port, the vessel  was still\
  \ swinging \nto starboard. The helmsman was prompt in  telling  the bridge team\
  \ that the vessel  was \n \n \n28 From the direction of between the starboard beam\
  \ and right astern. The starboard beam is the area at right \nangles to the  vessel's\
  \ fore and aft line s on the vessel's starboard side . \nNOT TO SCALE  \n \n  Final\
  \ Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 17 >>\n not manoeuvring as expected , and the pilot\
  \ responded promptly  by increasing the \nengine speed to half ahead . This had\
  \ the effect of increasing the propeller wash past \nthe rudder, thereby increasing\
  \ the rudder's effectiveness  \n3.16 However,  the vessel was by then coming close\
  \ to leaving the channel of Number 2 \nReach.  \nCurrent  and tidal flow  \n3.17\
  \ The pilot later submitted to the Co mmission that the sheer to starboard could\
  \ have \nbeen the result of an adverse and unusual current . Currents are generally\
  \ constant \nwater flow s generated by regional weather patterns. Tidal flows occur\
  \ in conjunction \nwith the rise and fall of the tides. The vertical motion of the\
  \ tides near the shore causes \nthe water to move horizontally, creating tidal flows\
  \ . Tidal flows are influenced  by \nintera ctions of the Earth, sun and moon, and\
  \ in Bluff generally reverse direction every \nsix hours.  \n3.18 A ship's track\
  \ through the water is the vector result ing from its  heading and speed  \nthrough\
  \ the water . If the body of water th rough  which the ship is transiting is  moving,\
  \ \nthe result of the ship's water -track vector and the current vector will be\
  \ the ship's track \nover the ground29. In open water the ship's heading is usua\
  \ lly unaffected by current . \nHowever, in shallower waters and narrow channels,\
  \ the direction and speed of the \ncurrent can be affected by the underwater topography\
  \ . For large ships t his could result \nin the influence of any current being different\
  \ along its length. This can have an effect \non the heading of the shi p. The effect\
  \  is generally predic table for given tidal flows in \ngiven channels . Pilots\
  \ have local knowledge and will generally be aware of these effects  \nand be ready\
  \ to counter them should they oc cur.  \nIt is feasible , however , that the sustained\
  \ wind and sea conditions from the east in  the \n10 days prior to this event may\
  \ have caused an unpredicted and unusual pattern of \ncurrents  in the Bluff Harbour\
  \  entrance channel , and that this may have , in combination \nwith other factors\
  \ iden tified in this report,  had some influence on the direction of the \nship\
  \ as it m ade its turn into Number Two Reach.  \nOptions for recovery  \n3.19 The\
  \ bridge team had two options available to recover  the planned track : continue\
  \  with \nincreased engine speed  and improved rudder effectiveness ; or bring the\
  \ vessel to a \nstop as soon as possible and engage the assistance of the tugs.\
  \  \n3.20 The pilot was  conscious  of the limited amount of safe water  ahead \
  \ and chose the \nsecond option and ordered the engine astern.  \n3.21 Evide nce\
  \ from the voyage data recorder showed it was about as likely  as not  that the\
  \ \nattempt to increase speed had just started to take effect. The vessel 's head\
  \ was \nbeginning to turn back to port when the order was given to stop the vessel\
  \  (see \nAppendix 1). However, this information  was not readily apparent  to the\
  \ pilot and the \nbridge team because the Alam Seri was operating with minimal electronic\
  \ aids to \nnavigation . The d ecreasing availability of safe water ahead and the\
  \ need to keep the \nship's speed under control for the berthing manoeuvre close\
  \ inside the harbour  likely \n \n \n29 Ignoring any effect for wind, which introduces\
  \ a leeway component . \n \n  Final Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 18 >>\n influenced\
  \ the pilot's decision to stop the vessel by using astern propulsion . Given the\
  \ \ncircumstances , the pilot's decision was understandable a nd a reasonable course\
  \ of \naction . \n3.22 The pilot ordered the engine full astern and the port anchor\
  \ to be let go. The port \nanchor could not be released and an attempt to release\
  \ the starboard anchor also \nfailed. This is discussed later in the analysis. Using\
  \ th e engine full astern in a timely \nmanner helped to reduce the speed sufficiently\
  \ , so that when the vessel did briefly \nground there was no significant damage.\
  \  \n3.23 After the pilot called the tugs they were available to assist  within\
  \ minutes.  The port's \npilotage p assage plan and operating procedures required\
  \ the tugs to be available to \nassist inbound vessel s at Number 2 Reach and ,\
  \ if required,  at Number 1 Reach, but this \nwas at the pilots ' discretion . The\
  \ normal practice was for the tugs to be secured  shortly \nafter an inbound vessel\
  \  entered Number 3 Reach. Although in this case earlier tug \nassistance may have\
  \ proved beneficial, sea conditions would likely have limited the \ntugs' effectiveness\
  \  and increased the risk for tug operations . Even within Number  2 \nReach, both\
  \ tugs suffered damage and broken towlines while assisting  in the recovery.  \n\

  \  \nBridge resource  management  \nSafety issue s: The  level of bridge resource\
  \ management on the bridge did not meet industry \ngood practice. The bridge team\
  \ could not effectively monitor the execution of the pilotage \nbecause they did\
  \ not have an agreed specific pilot plan, or agreed monitoring parameters \nappropriate\
  \ to the weather conditions at the time.  \n3.24 The International Chamber of Shipping\
  \ Bridge Procedures Guide describes an effective \nbridge team as one that \"will\
  \ manage efficiently all the resources that are available and \npromote good communication\
  \ and teamwork\".  Bridge resource  management  is a \nsystem that is used to manage\
  \ the risk of a single -point failur e - whether an \nequipment failure or a decision\
  \ -based lapse or error  - leading to a navigational \nincident. Members of the\
  \ bridge team monitor the vessel's progress against a defined \npassage plan and\
  \ they monitor the  manoeuvring inputs used to achieve the intended \npath of the\
  \ vessel.  When a member of the bridge team identifies a departure from the \nplan,\
  \ or is unsure of the intentions of the person conning the vessel, a query or \n\
  challenge should be raised.  \n3.25 The Internat ional Maritime Organization 's\
  \ (IMO 's) Resolution A.96030 provides \nguidance to pilotage authorities on managing\
  \ pilot training , and outlines \nrecommended operational procedures. The IMO recommends\
  \ that an  information \nexchange between a master and a  pilot be a process that\
  \ continues for the duration of \nthe pilotage. The content should include navigational\
  \ procedures, local conditions and rules and the ship's characteristics , and other\
  \ information determined  as relevant  by \nthe navigation demands of the specific\
  \  pilotage operation.  \n3.26 Communication and teamwork are essential to achieving\
  \ efficient bridge resource \nmanagement. The Alam Seri had its intended track drawn\
  \ onto a paper chart , which \nessentially followed the middle of the channel and\
  \ direction on the chart for each of \nthe Reaches. These courses and distances\
  \ were also described in a written passage \nplan. The vessel's courses were similar\
  \ to those depicted on the port passage plan \nprovided by the pilot. However, the\
  \ detail of how the vessel was going to achieve the \ntracks was missing from the\
  \ vessel's plan and were generic on the pilot's passage plan.  \nThere was in effect\
  \ no agreed pilotage plan specific to the exist ing conditions . The pilot \nindicated\
  \ to the Master the direction and effect of the remaining  tide. However, t here\
  \ \nwas no discussion about wheel -over points and the amount of helm to achieve\
  \ each \nalteration in course. The master commented on the strong wind and the pilot\
  \ and the \nmaster spoke about the wind in general, but there was no indication\
  \ t hat either \nthought that the wind would adversely affect the vessel as it transited\
  \ the port \nentrance. The pilot and the vessel's bridge team did not discuss what\
  \ actions were \nintended to execute the alteration of course into Number 2 Reach\
  \ in the weather \nconditions at the time.  \n3.27 During the master -pilot exchange\
  \ prior to the incident, the bridge team were asked  to \nchallenge the pilot's\
  \ actions if they were at all concerned. In the absence of an agreed \n \n \n30\
  \ IMO Resolution A.960(23): Recommendations on Training and Certification and Operational\
  \ Procedures for \nMaritime Pilots Other Than Deep -Sea Pilots, adopted 5 December\
  \ 2003.  \n \n  Final Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 21 >>\n passage plan specific\
  \ to the pilotage task , this request  set no boundaries and could \nhave been interpreted\
  \ differently from person to person.  \n3.28 As the ship transited Number 1 Reach,\
  \ the amount  of port helm  required (see Figure \n11) to maintain the desired course\
  \ should have engendered a discussion among the \nbridge te am about the effect\
  \ of the wind and how that would  affect the vessel  making \nthe turn into Number\
  \ 2 Reach. There was no such discussion, so  the bridge team had \nno way of knowing\
  \ what adjustments the pilot w as making to the standard approach \nto allow for\
  \ the conditions on the day.  \nElectronic navigational aids  \n3.29 As an existing\
  \ cargo vessel with a gross tonnage between 10,000 -20,000, the Alam Seri \nwas\
  \ required by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea to have\
  \ an \nelectronic ch art display and information system (ECDIS) installed. However,\
  \ the Alam \nSeri had a compliance date of July 2018 or the date of the next survey.\
  \ The Alam Seri \nwas scheduled to have an ECDIS installed during the next survey\
  \ period, in December 2018. As a result the Alam Seri was not fitted with an ECDIS\
  \ at the time of the incident, \nand the vessel's primary method of navigation was\
  \ paper charts.  \n3.30 Although the port company provided  portable pilot units\
  \ (PPUs) for pilots to use, the \npilot was not using a PPU at the time of the incident.\
  \ A PPU provides a pilot with an electronic navigation display, plots a vessel's\
  \ current and past positions, and calculates the vessel's predicted movements  based\
  \ on the current detected parameters . These \nparameters include the actu al GPS\
  \ track ( speed and direction made good) of the vessel \nand the rate of any turn\
  \ resulting from  the various  influences  of rudder,  wind and \ncurrent. A PPU\
  \ would have proved useful in the absence of any ship ECDIS or other \nchart plotter.\
  \  \n3.31 Consequently , the only real -time means available to the bridge team\
  \ for determining \nthe vessel's exact movements were radar and visual navigation\
  \ .  \n3.32 Electronic charting and information aids provide numerous benefits to\
  \ bridge teams through  increas ing their situational awareness. The benefits include\
  \ the ability to \ndisplay their vessels' real -time positions and predicted future\
  \ movements. Corridors of \nsafe navigation based on a ship's dra ught and available\
  \ depth of water can be \ndisplayed on the screen, giving instant visual awareness\
  \ of whether the ship has left , or \nis predicted to leave, the safe navigation\
  \ corridor. Other layers of  information can also  \nbe displayed, such as contingency\
  \ areas outside the safe navigation zone but where \nthe ship will not ground or\
  \ contact the bottom.  \n3.33 Although traditional methods of navigation can be\
  \ effective and should also be used , \nthey lack the additional features  and information\
  \ outputs of electronic navigation aids. \nImportantly, the predictive features\
  \ of electronic navigation aids such as ECDISs and PPUs might have informed the\
  \ bridge team  on whether, by leaving the engine speed \non half ahead for slightly\
  \ longer, it w ould have been possible to stay clear of the \ngrounding zone  and\
  \ r egain the safe navigation zone.  \n3.34 It is likely that these electronic navigation\
  \ aids would have improved the bridge team's \nsituational awareness and alerted\
  \ them earlier that the vessel was unable to maintain \nits course on Number 2 Reach.\
  \ The availability of electronic charting and information \naids would have also\
  \ likely assisted the pilot and the master to better assess the \noptions available\
  \ and aided their decision- making for recovering  from the situation.  \n \n  Final\
  \ Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 22 >>\n 3.35 Since the incident, all pilots at\
  \ South Port have been issued with PPUs and trained in \ntheir use. They are carried\
  \ on all pilotage jobs.  \nPilot training and proficiency  \nSafety issue: Pilot\
  \ currency and proficiency assessments were not imple mented as required by \nSouth\
  \ Port's pilot training and proficiency plan . \n3.36 At the time of the incident,\
  \ t he South Port S afety Management Manual (the safety \nmanagement manual) was\
  \ considered to be  consistent with the standards of the New \nZealand Port and\
  \ Harbo ur Marine Safety Code31. The safety management manual was \nbased on a \
  \ formal safety assessment that had been  conducted in 2003 to determine \nguidelines\
  \ and decision criteria for pilotage services and the risk management of \nmarine\
  \ infrastructure.  As of 29 November 2018  the manual was in its eighth edition\
  \ . \n3.37 The safety management manual covered standard procedures for arrivals\
  \ and \ndepart ures, the use of tugs, the application of decision criteria, emergency\
  \ procedures \nand other procedures deemed appropriate. One of the procedures addressed\
  \ the issue \nof a vessel not respond ing to starboard helm while transiting Number\
  \ 1 Reach in west - \nto so uth-west winds. The procedure state d that when a vessel\
  \ approached  the harbour \nentrance and started veering towards the shoreline,\
  \ and did  not respond to starboard \nhelm within a reasonable period of time, the\
  \ pilot \" shall cause the vessel to be stopped \nin the water using the vessel's\
  \ engine and anchors as deemed necessary \". \n3.38 Although the circumstances that\
  \ led to  the Alam Seri's loss of contr ol in a south -east \nwind were not specifically\
  \ mentioned , the pilot adopted the same principle to avoid or \nreduce the consequences\
  \ of a grounding . \n3.39 The c ontrol measures listed in the safety management\
  \ manual  to prevent a loss of \nmanoeuvrability included:  \n\u2022 professional,\
  \ well- trained pilot staff  \n\u2022 simulator training (crash stops)  \n\u2022\
  \ tug assistance whilst vessel under pilotage \n\u2022 vessel to inform the pilot\
  \ if there are any deficiencies in the bridge equipment, \nengines  or anchors or\
  \ any other factor that may affect safe p ilotage . \n3.40 To ensure that pilots\
  \ were well  trained and proficient, the safety management manual \nincluded a pilot\
  \ training and proficiency plan called the South Port Pilot and Tugmaster \nTraining\
  \ Manual  (the training manual) . This had been developed by South Port to train\
  \ \nand maintain competent pilots in the Bluff and Stewart Island pil otage areas\
  \ , and had \nbeen approved by Maritime New Zealand. It required pilots to progress\
  \ through each \npilot licence grade by means of practice, assessment a nd time.\
  \  \n3.41 To maintain currency for the Bluff pilotage area , the training manual\
  \ required  every  \npilot to undergo an internal annual review , which was carried\
  \ out by a designated \nSouth Port pilot . Additionally , a four-yearly external\
  \ assessment of proficiency  was \nrequired , to be carried out by a n external\
  \ assessor. Maritime Rules Part 90 : Pilotage  \nalso required  a pilot to complete\
  \ an annual assessment  of proficiency in the preceding  \n \n \n31 Port and Harbour\
  \ Marine Safety Code New Zealand, 2016 Edition, Maritime New Zeala nd. \n \n  Final\
  \ Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page 23 >>\n 12 months to maintain currency.  In the\
  \ five years prior to the incident, the pilot had \ncompleted annual assessments\
  \ of proficiency  at Bluff in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. \nThe pilot 's most recent\
  \ annual assessment of proficiency at Bluff had been conducted \nin April 2017,\
  \ 19 months prior to  the incident , which meant they were seven months \noverdue\
  \ for their next annual assessment . The pilot  had undergone an independent \n\
  assessment by an external assessor within  the Fiordland pilotage  area in 2018\
  \ , during \nthe passenger cruise season. However, t hat external  assessor had\
  \ not held a current \npilot licence for the Bluff pilotage area , so th e external\
  \ assessment could not be \ncounted as an annual assessment of proficiency fo r\
  \ the pilot.   \n3.42 Some aspects of a pilot's proficiency , for example bridge\
  \ resource management,  can \nbe satisfactorily assessed outside a  licensed  pilotage\
  \ area . However,  aspects re lating \nspecifically to the Bluff pilotage area cannot\
  \ be adequately assessed in another area32.  \n3.43 External assessments a re an\
  \ important aspect of the pi lot check and audit programme . \nThey are an important\
  \ mechanism for detecting and remedying  any potential bad \npractices or habits\
  \ that can form over time, ones not necessarily picked up by peers \nwho are deeply\
  \ imbedded in the same system culture. This is pa rticularly important for \nexperienced\
  \ pilots . \n3.44 The training manual  also required pilots to attend simulator\
  \ training every four years \nand refresher training such as a dvanced pilots training\
  \ every four years. The pilot had \nlast attended an advanced pilots training course\
  \ in November 2015 and  simulator \ntraining in February 2017.  Bridge resource\
  \ management is a topic covered in the \nadvanced pilot course and is often practised\
  \ during the simulator training courses . \n3.45 The accumulated knowledge and experience\
  \ of pilots is a major risk control measure for the safe navigation of commercial\
  \ vessels in New Zealand ports.  Although pilots do \nnot take command of vessel\
  \ s\n33, vessel operators still plac e a great deal of trust in \npilots ' local\
  \ knowledge, skills and experience.  \n3.46 An analysis of 20 years of the pilot's\
  \ operation records found that the pilot had conducted 20 inward transits in strong\
  \ winds from the south -east quadrant (refer to \nAppendix 2 for historical weather\
  \ data for Bluff) . Previous simulator training exercises \nhad provided pilots\
  \ with opportunities to operate in strong easterly and south- easterly \nwinds.\
  \ One simulator session had been carried out to ensure that lar ge container \n\
  vessels would be capable of making the turn into Number 2 Reach in south- east winds.\
  \  \nThese are examples  of the knowledge and experience a pilot can bring to a\
  \ port \noperation.  Additionally, g ood, active bridge resource management techniques\
  \ and \nadherence to training and development requirements can help to minimise\
  \ the risk of systemic accidents.  \n3.47 The Commission has made a recommendation\
  \ to the Chief Executive of South Port that \nthey ensure South Port's safety management\
  \ system develops measures to make \ncertain  that pilot training and proficiency\
  \ requirements are being met as per the \ntraining manual .  \n \n \n32 Determined\
  \ after consultation with members of the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association\
  \ , master mariners , \nand Maritime New Zealand.   \n33 Masters always retain command\
  \ of vessels in New Zealand ports.  \n \n  Final Report MO -2018- 206 \n<< Page\
  \ 24 >>\n Readiness of critical standby equipment  \n3.48 The use of anchors to\
  \ recover from a navigation emergency is a critical recovery \ncontrol to pr event\
  \ adverse outcomes . Industry best practice, as contained in the \nInternational\
  \ Chamber of Shipping  Bridge Procedures Guide, requires operational and \nemergency\
  \ checklists  to ensure that vessel s' equipment , such as anchors, is tested and\
  \ \nready for use.  An important item in the pre- arrival and pre- departure checklists\
  \ is a \nverification  that anchors are clear and ready for immediate use.   \n\
  3.49 The Alam Seri's pre -arrival checklist at Bluff confirmed that the anchors\
  \ were clear and \nready for use , as did the vessel 's pilot card.  Additionally\
  \ , the pilot's job sheet, signed  by \nthe master , confirmed that the vessel \
  \ was free of defects and that the anchors were \nready for immediate use.  \n3.50\
  \ However, w hen the order was given to let go the port anchor , the bra ke was\
  \ released  \nand the anchor did not d eploy . Three attempts were made, through\
  \  lowering and \nheaving the anchor a short distance under power on the windlass\
  \ , to try to free it \nbefore the master ordered the chief officer to try the starboard\
  \  anchor.  The st arboard \nanchor did not deploy  and had to be lowered and raised\
  \ under power  before it \ndropped on the third attempt . By this  time the vessel\
  \ had stopped and the anchor was \nno longer required .  \n3.51 The operator's safety\
  \ management system categorised  the anchor wi ndlasses as critical \nstandby equipment.\
  \  The planned maintenance schedules required greasing of the \nwindlasses every\
  \ four months and brake testing every six months.   \n3.52 An analysis of the planned\
  \ maintenance records showed that the windlasses had been \ngreased more frequently\
  \ than required by the planned maintenance system.   \n3.53 It could not be established\
  \ why the anchors did not deploy when required. The \nstarboard anchor had been\
  \ used for r outine anchoring outside ports in Australia and \nAsia during September\
  \ and October  2018. However, during routine deployment there \nis not the same\
  \ urgency to stop the vessel as there is in emergency anchoring . On \nsome vessels\
  \  the anchors do not run out freely due to their design and  an anchor  may \n\
  require lowering from the hawse pipe prior to deployment.  If that was the case\
  \  for the \nAlam Seri, this is information that would have been expected to be\
  \ discussed during \nthe master -pilot exchange.  \n \n  Final Report MO -2018-\
