The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and inciden ts with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for th at purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 17 June 2014 a track maintenance work area had been established between National  
Park and Raurimu on the North Island Main Trunk line.  Part of th e work involved the use of an 
excavator designed to operate on the rails.  
1.2. Prior to the work group starting work, two trains were scheduled to pass through the area.  The 
first train passed t hrough without incident.  The rail protection officer who was in charge of site 
safety and protection authorised the second  train to pass through the area.  Meanwhile, 
unbeknown to the rail protection officer, the excavator driver had driven his excavator onto the 
track to start work.  
1.3. The train passed the main work group and rounded a curve in the track.  The train driver saw 
the excavator on the track ahead and applied emergency braking, but was unable to stop his 
train colliding with the excavator .  
1.4. The excavator was significantly damaged in the collision and the driver was critically injured . 
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation  Commission (Commission) found that the train was 
authorised to travel through the work area, but the excavator was not authorise d to occupy the 
track.  
1.6. The excavator driver , working under KiwiRail supervision,  likely thought he was authorised to 
occupy the track because he had misinterpreted a 'thumbs up'  signal to mean that work  was 
about to begin , and because he had not been fully  briefed on the work plan for the day.  
1.7. The Commission also found that non -compliance with KiwiRail standard operating procedures 
for the planning, the establishment and the running of the protected work area was a  factor 
that contributed to the accident . 
1.8. The key lesson s identified from the inquiry into this occurrence are:  
 workers with safety -critical roles can be placed in unsafe situations when standard 
operating procedures are not followed  
 seatbelts are known to prevent injuries in vehicle accidents and  should always be worn 
where fitted.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The accident  occurred between National Park  and Raurimu  at about 0910 on Tuesday 17 
June 2014.  The NZ Transport Agency  notified the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission (Commission) soon  after the accident occurred.  The Commission opened an 
inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to 
determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence and appointed an investigator in 
charge.   The accid ent site was immediately 'frozen ' until Commission investigators completed 
the site examination . 
2.2. Commission investigator s arrived at the accident site later that day. They inspected the hi -rail 
excavator, the train and the boards protecting the planned wor k area .  
2.3. The following day the Commis sion investigator s conducted individual interviews with KiwiRail 's 
work group that had been on site at the time of the accident.  
2.4. Owing  to his injuries the driver of the hi -rail excavator  was not able to be interviewed.  
2.5. The Commission obtained the following records and documents for analysis:  
 the application for planned work  
 witness statements   
 download ed data from the train's event recorder  
 the signals data log  
 the train controller's voice recording  
 training records for  all personnel working at the accident site  
 drug and alcohol test results for all Kiw iRail personnel carrying out the planned work  
 the emergency service 's incident log.  
2.6. The hi -rail excavator was trans ported to the Commission's secure wreckage facility in  
Wellington for a detailed examination.  On 27 June 2014 Work Safe New Zealand , supervised 
by Commission  staff , carried out an inspection  of the excavator . 
2.7. On 4 July 2014  the radio communication equipment was removed from the hi -rail excavator 
and taken to the manufacturer's laboratory in Wellington for testing.  
2.8. On 27 July 2016  the Commission approved the draft report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.

 3. Factual information  
3.1 Background information   
3.1.1.  KiwiRail owns and maintains the rail tr ack throughout most of the New Zealand rail network.  
KiwiRail Network Authorities  prepare and issue daily information bulletins that include 
planned track maintenance carried out under KiwiRail Track Safety Rules. 
3.1.2.  A KiwiRail track field engineer submitted  an 'Application for Planned Work ' to KiwiRail Network 
Authorities on 13 June 2014 for approval (see Appendix 1) .  
3.1.3.  The application was for a worksite to be established  between National Park and Raurimu from 
0730 to 1630 daily , from 16 June to 20 June 2014  inclusive .  It was intended  that planned 
track maintenance work would be carried out using KiwiRail Track Safety  Rule 905,  
Compulsory Stop Protection . 
3.1.4.  The application  was approved by Network Authorities and details of the planned work were 
show n on the inf ormation bulletin2 for the central North Island area (see Appendix 2).  The 
bulletin showed that compulsory stop boards protect ing the w ork area would be erected at 
348.60 kilometres3 National Park , and 358.00 kilometres Raurimu.  
3.1.5.  The compulsory stop protection system controls the entry of trains and hi -rail vehicles4 to a 
planned work area using a series of warning boards (see Appendix 3 for details).  All trains and 
hi-rail vehicles must stop at the compulsory stop board  and the driver s must contact the rail 
protection officer for authorisation to proceed.  
3.1.6.  A rail protection officer  is a person  who is responsible for protecting one or multiple worksites 
depending on the level of competency held.  That person has overall responsibility for 
providing rail pro tection for the work area  by co-ordinating the movement of trains and rail 
vehicles within and through the work area , and for communicating with train control.  
3.1.7.  Southbound trains5 could enter the protected work area from either the main  line or the 
crossing loop at Raurimu.  E ntry was controlled by a c ompulsory stop board placed beside two 
signals (signals 4LA and 4LB ).  These signals were set by the train controller at red (Stop) for 
the duration of the planned work.   
3.1.8.  Before authorising a driver to proceed , a rail protection officer  must have confirmation that all 
personnel and machines are clear of the track .  Conditional authority can then be given to the 
driver to pass the stop board once  train control has clear ed the signal.  The rail protection 
officer  then  contac ts the train controller and ask s for the controlling signal to be set to 
'proceed '6.  The train can then  enter the work area .   
3.2. The accident  
3.2.1.  Work at the site began o n Monday 16 June 2014 .  A Palmerston North -based KiwiRail track 
production  work  group (the work group)  was being  supported by the local KiwiRail Ohakune 
track maintenance team . and a contractor  who provided a  hi-rail excavator with a driver.   
                                                        
2 An information bulletin is an instruction issued by KiwiRail's Network Authorities Wellington, usually the day 
before it comes into effect.  The information bulletin is distributed to all operating staff who may be affe cted, 
including drivers and track maintenance staff.   
3 The location is referenced as the distance from Wellington Station platform.  
4 A hi-rail vehicle is a road vehicle fitted with retractable hi -rail wheels such that it can be driven along a track 
and can be on/off tracked at suitable locations .  
5 Southbound trains are trains travelling towards Wellington.  
6 A proceed indication is a signal showing a clear or caution indication for normal, intermediate, medium or 
low speed.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 3.2.2.  The excavator was a Hitachi Zaxis 70 and was fitted with a retractable hi -rail attachment t hat 
enabled it to travel on and operate from a railway track.  The excavator was fitted with a multi -
channel Tait TM8200 radio that had a KiwiRail -allocated radio call sign, 60264.  
3.2.3.  The team leader was from  the Palmerston North work g roup  and the r ail prote ction officer  was 
from the Ohakune work group . 
3.2.4.  The planned re -rail work was on a 400 -metre -long, 165 -metre -radius curve that had a posted 
curve speed of 45 kilometres per hour.  
3.2.5.  Trains operating on the single -line track between National Park and Raurimu we re signalled 
from the national train control centre in Wellington under centralised traffic control 
regulations . 
3.2.6.  The section of track was part of the electrified main trunk line.  An electrical safety observer  
(electrical observer ) issued a 'Permit to Work  Near Railway Power  Lines' (the permit) to the hi-
rail excavator driver at 1200.  The excavator driver signed the permit to confirm receipt and 
that he understood the conditions under which it was issued.  The first day's maintenance 
passed without inciden t. 
3.2.7.  The team leader was notified very late on 16 June that the Ohakune -based work group would 
not be on site the next day due to training commitments at Wanganui.   The information was 
not shared with his work group that day. The next morning a  member of the Palmerston North 
work group  volunteered to carry out  rail protection duties .  The work group departed from the 
Ohakune depot at about 0630 .   
3.2.8.  The rail protection officer was due to pass through the worksite  in a hi -rail vehicle in order to 
place the compu lsory stop boards and various  other  warning boards at each  end of the 
worksite  for that day .  At about 0650 t he team leader met the excavator driver at National  
Park and suggested that he on-track the excavator behind the rail protection officer 's hi-rail 
vehicle and follow him to the worksite .  
3.2.9.  At about 0700 t he electrical observer and t he excavator driver discussed the day's work plan.  
The electrical observer  issued the driver  with a new permit .  Unlike the previous day  the 
planned work would be carried out with the electrical overhead traction equipment 'live'.  The  
excavator driver  signed the permit confirming that he understood that the ex cavator was not 
to be operated within two metres of the overhead equipment and that the electrical observer 
was req uired to be present whenever the excavator was working  (see Appendix 4).   
3.2.10.  At 0737 t he rail protection officer  radio ed train control  and request ed a track occupation for 
his hi -rail vehicle to travel from National Park to Raurimu so that he could erect the  various 
boards (see Figure 1) .  The train controller set the  control signals at National Park and 
Raurimu at 'Stop', and authorised the track occupation . 
3.2.11.  At 0738 the rail protection officer  completed a 'Track Occupation Cross Check ' form (see 
Appendix 5).   He was authorised to occupy the track section until 0810 when a southbound 
freight train was expected to approach from the direction of Raurimu.  
3.2.12.  The rail protection officer erected the w arning boards at the south (National Park) end of the 
protected work  area  then drove along the track north towards Raurimu .  He stopped where the 
excavator had been parked overnight and gave the excavator driver verbal permission to on -
track his excavator and follow him to the worksite.  The electrical observer drove  along  the 
KiwiRail access  road to the worksite . 
3.2.13.  At 0753 the rail protection officer  radioed  train control  and arranged a five -minute extension 
to his track occupation.  He stopped briefly at the worksite and told one of the work group to 
"Stay off the track as I may not get all the boards up in time and there are two trains coming ".  
The rail protection officer  then continued towards Raurimu.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 3.2.14.  Meanwhile the excavator driver  had on-tracked  his excavato r and driven along the track, 
arriving at the  worksite about five minutes after  the rail protection officer  had passed through .  
He then  off-tracked his excavator about 40 metres around a curve and  out of sight of where 
the work group  had parked their vehi cles beside the track  (see Figure 2).   
3.2.15.  The excavator driver then radio ed the rail protection officer and told him that he was "off and 
clear of the track" .  The excavator driver sat in the cab for about 10 minutes before he walk ed 
back and joined other me mbers of the work g roup  who had congregated near their parked 
vehicles.    
 
Figure 2 
Access road along which the work group vehicles were  parked   
3.2.16.  At 0815 t he rail protection officer  radioed train control to cancel his track occupa tion.  He 
report ed that the stop boards had been erected and that he was off and clear of the track.  
Train control confirmed that a southbound freight train w ould be the first train to pass through 
the work area .  The southbound train would then cross wit h the northbound train at National 
Park station .  The two trains would stop there and the drivers would then change trains.  The 
northbound train would then pass through the work area.  
3.2.17.  The rail protection officer  drove a further 1.5 kilometres to erect th e northern -end warning 
boards  then started to drive back to the worksite  by road.   He radioed the team leader at the 
worksite to test radio  coverage , but got no response.   He then used his cell phone to call the 
team leader but the call w as not answered.  
3.2.18.  The rail protection officer  was back at Raurimu by the time the southbound freight train 
stopped at the compulsory stop board.  At 0827 t he train driver radioed the rail protection 
officer  and asked him for permission to pass the compulsory stop board at Raurimu.   The rail 
protection officer  called the worksite  on his radio  and received confirmation that the track was 
clear for the southbound train to travel through the worksite at normal speed.  The rail 
protection officer  also confirmed with the maintenanc e work group  that there would be a crew 
change at National Park then a  northbound train would come through the worksite.  He 
repeated that everyone was to stay clear of the track.  
3.2.19.  The rail protection officer  then g ave the driver of the southbound train permission to pass the 
compulsory stop board once the signal had changed to 'proceed' .  The rail protection officer  
radioed the train controller, who then changed the signal to  'proceed '. 

  
Final report AO-2014-104 
<< Page 7 >>
 3.2.20.  The southbound train then passed through the work area without incident .  The northbound 
freight train had already berthed on the crossing loop when the southbound train entered the 
main  line at National Park .  The drivers changed trains  and the  northbound train departed 
National Park at about 0900 .  
3.2.21.  Three minutes later  the n orthbound train stopped at the compulsory stop board .  The driver 
radioed  the rail protection officer  and requested permission to pass the compulsory stop 
board between National Park and Raurimu . 
3.2.22.  The rail protection officer  was in his truck at the worksite  when the train driver made the radio 
call.  He authorised the driver to pass the compulsory stop board and  to proceed through the 
protected work area  at the authorised line speed.  The radio communication between the rail 
protection officer  and the  train  driver was broadcast over external speakers on his truck .  It is 
not known whether the excavator driver heard  or understood the radio conversation .    
3.2.23.  The rail protection officer  then left his truck and gave a 'thumbs up ' signal to the work group .  
He received a similar acknowledgement  from some of the workers .  Witnesses recall ed that 
the excavator driver was in the vicinity when the rail protection officer gave the 'thumbs up' 
signal.   They also recalled seeing him walk off in the direction of the excavat or shortly 
after wards . 
3.2.24.  The train passed the work group travelling at about 45 kilometres per hour, the maximum 
permitted speed.   The train then entered a right -hand curve, and as it did so the train driver  
saw the excavator on the track ahead with its buck et facing north.  At 0909:48  the driver 
made an emergency brake application and sounded the locomotive  whistle to alert the 
excavator driver .   
3.2.25.  The train driver saw the excavator driver look over his shoulder at the train and begin to  rotat e 
the bucket in the direction of the locomotive.   
3.2.26.  The train was travelling at 42 kilometres per hour when it struck the excavator , but it took  a 
further 103 metres to come to a stop (see Figure 3).  The excavator was extensively damaged 
in the collision.  The train drive r informed the train controller , who alerted the emergency 
services.  KiwiRail staff on site tried to keep the excavator driver alert until emergency services 
personnel arrived.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 3.3. Communication s  
3.3.1.  Three co mmunication systems were used within the protected work area : radio channel 1, 
radio channel 3 and cell phones assigned to the rail protection officer , the team leader , the 
electrical safety observer, various members of the work group and the driver of the  hi-rail 
excavator.  Channel 1  is a very-high-frequency ( VHF) point -to-point (line -of-sight) that under 
normal circumstances was  expected to have coverage  of up to five kilometres , but this was 
dependent on the radio's power output and the surrounding terra in.  Channel 1 was referred 
to as the 'local channel ' and was used by the rail protection officer  to communicate with 
drivers stopped at the compulsory stop board, the excavator driver , and other members of the 
work group .  The rail protection officer  was stationed near the worksite about 2.7 kilometres 
from the south -end compulsory stop board and nearly seven kilometres from the north -end 
compulsory stop board.   
3.3.2.  Channel 3 was a repeater -assisted VHF radio channel for communication with train control . 
The radio system was 'open channel ', allowing  any person within the coverage area to hear all 
radio transmissions using that repeater.   
3.3.3.  The use of cell phones was considered an acceptable means of communication between the 
rail protection officer  and drivers waiting for permission to enter the protected work area.  The 
information bulletin dated 17 June 2014  made reference to both the cell phone number and 
the phonetic radio call sign for the rail protection officer .   
3.3.4.  The rail protection officer  had difficult y contacting his work group with both radio and cell 
phone while he was erecting the boards at the northern end of the work area.   
3.4. Key personnel  
3.4.1.  All KiwiRail personnel on site at the time of the accident participated in a post-incident drug 
and alcohol s creening test .  All personnel returned negative result s.    
The rail protection officer   
3.4.2.  The KiwiRail Track Safety Rules, effective from 6 October 2013, defined the rail protection 
officer  as: 
The person with overall responsibility for:  
 Providing rail pro tection for the Work Area with one or multiple work sites; 
the nature of the work sites and activity will determine the level of 
protection required.  
 Co-ordinating movement of all rail vehicles within and through the 
Protected Work Area.  
 Responsible for co mmunicating with Train Control.  
 Where more than one work site is operating, Site Protectors  will report to 
the rail protection officer . 
Note:  
rail protection officer  who is Track Protection Advanced ( TPA) 1.37 qualified are 
in charge of multi work sites wi thin a Protected Work Area.  
3.4.3.  KiwiRail Track Safety Rule 901 (h) stated:  
h. Safe Place briefings   
Before work commences for the day and when the Work Site relocates, the Site 
Protector/RPO [rail protection officer] must brief all personnel on the 'Safe 
Place'. 
                                                        
7 A person with an Advanced  TPA 1.3 qualification may use a variety of protection systems for multiple 
worksites within one major work area protected in accordance with KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 910 'Work 
Arrangements - Multiple Activities' . 
  
Final report AO-2014-104 
<< Page 9 >>
 The Track Safety Rules defined the 'Safe Place' as:  
A place where people and equipment cannot be struck by passing rail traffic.  
3.4.4.  The person carrying out the rail protection officer  duties on the day of the accident held a TPA 
qualification that allowed  him to protect a single worksite  using compulsory stop protection.  
He was certified  to operate a hi -rail vehicle and his Electrification Awareness certification was 
current.  
The team leader  
3.4.5.  KiwiRail's position profile for a team leader  of a track mainte nance work group  stated in part:  
Role Purpose   
Working as part of the team, the team leader is resp onsible for leading, 
supervising and for the efficient operation of the work group, to achieve track 
maintenance, repair and renewal work both planned and un planned, in a timely 
and cost effective manner which reflect s operational priority.  Ensure work is 
carried out in a way which complies with all KiwiRail Network quality, safety and 
engineering standards.  
Rail Safety System Responsibilities     
 Safety is t he first priority of all employees on the national rail system  
 Responsible for complying with rail safety system standards, procedures 
and statutory requirements within your area of responsibility  
 Responsible for your own safety and that of other rail empl oyees, 
contractors and visitors within your work environment  
 Responsible for the identification, reporting and initial control of any 
safety or environmental hazard identification within your area.  
3.4.6.  The team leader 's track protection qualification TPA 1.3 w as current and he was competent to 
carry out the rail protection officer 's duties covering multiple worksites within a major 
protected work area .   
3.4.7.  The most recent safety observation s had been  carried out on the team leader and his work 
group on 14 Novembe r 2013 and 21 March 2013 while carrying out work under compulsory 
stop protection.  
The electrical safety observer (the electrical observer)  
3.4.8.  The electrical observer's certification was current for the task he was undertaking.  He had 
acted as an observer f or the excavator driver on previous occasions.   
The driver of the hi -rail excavator (the excavator driver )  
3.4.9.  The excavator driver , employed  by Downer , was working under the supervision of KiwiRail.  He  
had operated hi -rail excavators on the railway network  since 2008.  His certification for TPA 
(Theory), and AC and DC Electrification Awareness was current.  However, records showed that 
KiwiRail had not carried out a  safety observation of the excavator driver since 24  November 
2010.  
3.4.10.  The excavator driver unde rwent an alcohol screening test on admission to Waikato Hospital.  
The result was negative.  
3.4.11.  The excavator driver suffered severe head injuries in the collision and remained in an induced 
coma for several months.  Owing to the severity of his injuries, he w as not capable of being 
interviewed.  He has since made a minimal recovery and has no recollection of the accident.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction   
4.1.1.  The protection of work groups while they are maintaining the rail tracks is a safety -critical 
process.  Any flaw in,  or lack of adherence to, the processes for providing such protection can 
have high consequences, as this accident show ed.  
4.1.2.  The driver of the northbound train followed the required procedures and had the appropriate 
authority before entering the work area.   The train was travelling at less than  the maximum 
speed limit and the driver did everything possible to prevent the collision when he saw  the 
excavator on the track ahead.  
4.1.3.  The excavator should not have been occupying the track at the time.  
4.1.4.  The following analysis discusses what happened to cause the collision between the train and 
the excavator.  
4.1.5.  Two safety issues have been identified that contributed in some way to the collision.  
4.1.6.  The first is the process for protecting the work group .  It relied too heavil y on the rail protection 
officer being able to check the whereabouts of every member of what was a large work group , 
and relied too heavily on the assumption that all workers on site clearly understood when it 
was safe for them  to occupy the track.  
4.1.7.  The sec ond safety issue is that notwithstanding the weakness  in the process, the process  was 
not adhered to , neither at the planning stage nor in the implementation of the work plan.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  When the rail protection officer arrived back to where the work gr oup was assembled he had 
no idea whether the southbound train had passed their location.  
4.2.2.  As it happened, the track was clear and the southbound train  had not yet passed through the 
work area .   
4.2.3.  It was a breakdown in communication at the work area assembly point that led to the collision.  
When the driver of the northbound train requested permission to drive through the work area, 
he received the authority f rom the rail protection officer.  The rail protection officer  then 
assumed that the members of the wor k group had overheard him giving the train authority 
over the external loud speakers on the truck.  He then exited the truck and gave the group a 
'thumbs up ' signal.  
4.2.4.  It is likely that the excavator driver interpreted this signal as indicating that work  was about to 
begin on the track.   He then walked around the curve and on-track ed the excavator , which was 
out of sight of the work group.  
4.2.5.  The a uthority for the northbound train to enter the protected work area was given some  time 
between 0903:09 , when the tra in stopped , and 0904:35 when it started to move again.  
4.2.6.  Data from the train event recorder showed a period of five  minutes and 15 seconds between  
the time the train entered the protected work area and the collision.  This was sufficient time 
for the excavat or driver  to acknowledge the 'thumbs up ' signal  given by the rail protection 
officer , walk to the excavator and place it on the track ahead of the northbound train.  It was 
very likely that he had only just placed the excavator on the track when the train rounded the 
curve , because  he had not yet lowered the hi -rail equipment onto the rails.  
4.2.7.  The excavator driver had signed a 'Permit to Work  Near Railway Power Lines ' that morning.  
One of the conditions of the permit was that the overhead was 'alive', and th e electrical 
observer was required to be present when the excavator was operating on or near the track.  
The electrical observer was nowhere near the excavator at the time of the accident.  He was 
  
Final report AO-2014-104 
<< Page 11 >>
 waiting for the northbound train to pass and had stayed nea r his vehicle at the southern end 
of the curve , which was out of sight of the excavator.  
4.2.8.  The excavator driver  was employed by Downer.  One of Downer's 10 'Cardinal Rules ' was 
"NEVER  operate a vehicle while using a handheld mobile phone nor without wearing a seatbelt 
where fitted".  There was no evidence that the excavator driver  was using a cell phone at the 
time.  However, he was not wearing the seatbelt that had been fitted to the excavator.  This 
was confirmed by the train driver and subsequently noted b y the attending police officer.  The 
seatbelt had been placed behind the driver's seat.  Had he been wearing his seatbelt it is 
likely that  the severity of his injuries would  have been reduced.  
Findings : 
1 The northbound freight train had been authorised to pass through the work 
area and at the time of the accident was being driven at less than  the 
maximum permitted  line speed.  
2 The excavator was not authorised to occupy the track at the time of the 
accident . 
3 It is likely that the excavator driver thought he h ad been authorised to occupy 
the track and begin work when he was given a n ambiguous  'thumbs up' signal  
by the rail protection officer.  
 
 
4.3. Operating procedures  
Planning  
Safety issue  - A failure by KiwiRail to follow its operating rules and procedures at th e planning 
stage of the work assignment resulted in the work group being under -resourced to manage the 
protection and safety of the track maintenance workers  effectively . 
4.3.1.  The application for the planned work between National Park and Raurimu (see Appendix 1) 
was submitted in a timely manner.  The submitter proposed that KiwiRail Track Safety Rule 
905, Compulsory Stop Protection, be used to manage train movements through the planned 
work area.  
4.3.2.  The submitter identified that the planned work involved multiple activities at multiple 
worksite s within the work area, and that a person certified for safe working at a major work 
area ( KiwiRail Track Safety Rule 910) had been arranged.  The team leader's name and his 
cell phone number were  recorded on the application form as the 'Protection Person '.  
However, it was not appropriate for the team leader to fulfil the duties of the rail protection 
officer  over and above his main responsibility for the output and performance of the  work 
group . 
4.3.3.  As set out in paragraph 3.4.4  the team leader was responsible for leading, supervising and the 
efficient operation of the work group, and for ensuring  that the work was carried out in a way 
that complie d with all "KiwiRail Network quality, safety and engineering standards ". 
4.3.4.  The role o f the rail protection officer was created in  response to protection issues encountered 
at multiple worksites.  The role was formalised in September 2011 and more recently issued 
in KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules, effective from 6 October 2013 .  KiwiRail des cribed the rail 
protection officer as the person with overall responsibility for : 
 Providing rail protection for the Work Area with one or multiple work sites  
 Co-ordinating movement of rail vehicles within and through the Protected 
Work Area  
 Responsible fo r communicating with Train Control  

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report RO -2014 -104 4.3.5.  The planned work potentially involve d multiple activities within a 7.5 -kilometre -long section of 
track .  KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 910 'Work Arrangements - Multiple Activities'  required the 
rail protection officer to a ppoint a site protect or at each  worksite within the protected work 
area .   
4.3.6.  The application  to KiwiRail Netwo rk Authorities did show that the protected work area would 
be managed under  KiwiRail Rule 910, 'Work Arrangements - Multiple Activities '.  However, 
after processing the application , Network Authorities distributed the daily information bulletin 
with the work area shown as a single activity.   This removed the requirement for the rail 
protection officer to appoint site protectors at each worksite , leavi ng him with the unrealistic 
task of managing the protection and safety of all personnel within the entire 7.5-kilometre -
long work area.  It also meant that , theoretically , the rail protection officer required only a TPA 
1.1 qualification  (manage single worksite s), which he held, rather than the TPA 1.3 
qualification (manage multiple worksite s), which he did not hold . 
4.3.7.  Another issue arose with the 'Application for Traction Overhead Power Off' that was submitted 
to Network Authorit ies.  The application was err oneously made for the 1 ,500-volt DC 
Wellington network instead of the 25,000 -volt AC system present at the work area.  The error 
went unnoticed and the application was approved.  
At the work area  
Safety issue  - Numerous examples of non -compliance with KiwiR ail operating standards were 
evident at the worksite , of which some were contributory to the accident . 
4.3.8.  The day before this accident a pre -shift safety briefing was held.  Fourteen workers , including 
the excavator driver , signed the 'Job Plan ' form to confi rm that they understood the hazards 
and controls in place.  However, there was no register to record the names of the workers on 
site, when they arrived or when they departed.   This omission made it potentially more difficult 
for the pers on in charge of pr otecting the workers  to know with any certainty whether all 
persons at the worksite  were accounted for (and off and clear of the track) before allowing a 
train to enter the work area.  
4.3.9.  Before work commence d on site each day, all personnel, including contrac tors, were  required 
to participate in a pre -shift briefing and sign the 'Job Plan ' form to confirm that they:  
 knew where the safe place was  
 understood the track protection procedures in place for the day  
 had been briefed  on and understood the relevant co ntent of the information bulletin  
 understood the work area communications plan  
 understood the emergency procedures that had been communicated  
 had been  made aware that a contractor was operating a hi -rail excavator near the 
overhead line under the direct ion of an electrical safety observer   
 were fit for duty  
 had considered the prevention of slips and falls  
 wore the personal protecti ve equipment suitable for the tasks allocated . 
4.3.10.  However, on the day of the accident a pre -shift briefing was not held .  The  reason given was  
that there was no job plan booklet available.  The booklet  used the day before was provided by 
the local Ohakune track group , which  was not part of the work group th is day.  There were six 
KiwiRail work vehicles parked within the work are a.  It would have been unusual for job plan 
booklet s to be missing from all of these vehicles.  Regardless of whether a job plan book let 
was available, this should not have prevent ed a safety briefing being held  and the 'safe place' 
being designated .  
  
Final report AO-2014-104 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.3.11.  A safety briefing would have reminded the excavator driver of two important points: he should 
not wander from the 'safe place' before receiving confirmation from the rail protection officer  
that it was safe to begin work, and he should have the electrical obse rver with him while 
working near the electric traction overhead line .   
4.3.12.  Another example of non -compliance was w hen the rail protection officer was establishing  the 
boards  protecting the work area.   He realised that he would not clear the limits of his trac k 
occupation within the authorised 'clear by ' time, so he radioed train control for additional time.  
Instead of cancelling the authority and completing a new form, the rail protection officer  
crossed out the previously recorded times and substituted 0753 as the commence time and 
0815 as the complete time.  KiwiRail procedures required that the original track occupation 
cross -check be cancelled and a new authority issued and recorded . 
4.3.13.  It was the rail protection officer's  belief that work had not started before the accident  because 
he had yet to give the work group authority to occupy the track.  The Commission takes a 
different view,  because : 
 the work had started when the work group began to assemble at the worksite from 0700 
onwards  and were exposed to the potential risks  
 the rail protection officer was given authority from train control to establish the protected 
work area at 0738  
 the driver of the hi -rail excavator was given permission to on-track his digger , follow the 
rail protection officer's hi -rail v ehicle and off -track his vehicle within the protected work 
area  
 the rail protection officer gave the drivers of a southbound train and a northbound train 
permission to pass through the protected work area.  
4.3.14.  Although the protected work area was being operate d as a single worksite at the time of the 
accident, the rail protection officer was about  seven kilometres away from the work group 
when he authorised the first (southbound) train to enter the protected work area .  Before  
giving that verbal authority to th e train driver by radio, he had sought and received 
confirmation by radio that all members of the work group and machines were clear of the 
track.  However, the person providing this confirmation was neither a dedicated rail protection 
officer nor a 'site protector' who would normally have been appointed for each individual 
worksite had more than one existed within the protected work area.  
4.3.15.  Since this accident KiwiRail has introduced a new 'lock -out' procedure to ensure that all track 
workers are accounted f or before trains are permitted to enter a work area. As a result of the 
actions taken by KiwiRail to address this issue no recommendation has been made.  Refer 
Section 6 and Appendix 6.  
Qualifications  
4.3.16.  KiwiRail operating procedures required that anyone ca rrying out safety -critical tasks be 
appropriately trained and undertake biennial theory assessments as well as undergo three 
practical assessments within a 24 -month period.  These assessments had to  also be carried 
out on contractors who held operating cer tificates.   
4.3.17.  The driver  of the hi -rail excavator had the TPA theory qualification.  However, he had not 
undergone a safety observation by KiwiRail personnel since 24 November 2010 and therefore 
his qualification was deemed to have expired.  Neither the tea m leader nor the rail protection 
officer had the means to determine the status of the contractor's operating qualifications 
because the records were maintained remotely .  The Commission has previously made a 
recommendation to address this issue in its repo rt 11 -1038.  That recommendation still has

Main Trunk, 25 August 2011.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report RO -2014 -104 an open status pending confirmation from KiwiRail that the intent of the recommendation has 
been met . 
Summary  
4.3.18.  There are several examples given above of non -adherence to KiwiRail procedures for planning 
track ma intenance , setting up a work area , and protecting track workers from injury while they 
are working.  Some of the non -adherence s to standard operating practices were factors that 
contributed to the accident . 
4.3.19.  Non-compliance with KiwiRail's procedures by the track maintenance work group and the 
network authority is a safety issue .   
4.3.20.  The NZ Transport Agency conducted its own system -focused investigation into this accident in 
order to identify any safety deficiencies that were relevant to KiwiRail's Safety Case and safety 
system  (refer Section 6, Safety actions ).  The investigation concluded that the failings sat 
within the following categories:  
 training awareness  
 work p lanning and practices  
 communication at the worksite  
 the vulnerability of controls to procedur al failures . 
4.3.21.  The NZ Transport Agency required KiwiRail to make improvements in 11 areas of its worksite 
activities.  In view of the safety actions taken by the NZ Transport Agency , the Commission has 
not made a recommendation to address this safety issue.  
Findings : 
4 The work plan for the day  was not effectively communicated to the work group, 
including the excavator driver, which was a factor contributing to the accident.  
5 Operational p lanning was not done in accordance with KiwiRail 's standard 
operating pro cedures .  Inadequate resourcing compromised the safety and 
protection of the track maintenance work group.  
6 By not holding a safety briefing before work started, as was required by 
KiwiRail operating rules, the work group was not made aware of the 'safe 
place' where personnel and equipment were to remain until the rail protection 
officer authorised work to resume.  
 
 
 5. Findings  
5.1. The northbound freight train had been authorised to pass through the work area and at the 
time of the accident was being driven at less than  the maximum permitted line speed.  
5.2. The excavator was not authorised to occupy the track at the time of the accident.  
5.3. It is likely that the excavator driver thought he had been authorised to occupy the track and 
begin work when he was given a n ambi guous  'thumbs up' signal by the rail protection officer.  
5.4. The work plan for the day was not effectively communicated to the work group, including the 
excavator driver, which was a factor contributing to the accident.  
5.5. Operational planning was not done in acc ordance with KiwiRail's standard operating 
procedures.  Inadequate resourcing compromised the safety and protection of the track 
maintenance work group.  
5.6. By not holding a safety briefing before work started, as was required by KiwiRail operating 
rules, the  work group was not made aware of the 'safe place' where personnel and equipment 
were to remain until the rail protection officer authorise d work to resume.   
 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. KiwiRail's operating Rule 910 , 'Work Arrangements Multiple Activities' , has been discontinued 
and replaced by Rule 902 , 'Managing a Protected Work Area'.  KiwiRail published revised Track 
Safety Rules, Issue 3, effective from 30 June 2015.  The revision included new site safety Rule 
902, Managing a Protected Work Area (see Appendix 6 ).    
6.3. Rule 902, ref erred to as a 'Lock on, lock off ' procedure, was developed to ensure that a 
protected work area is clear of personnel and machinery before trains are authorised to enter.  
All workers, including contractors and visitors, are required to carry a coloured pe rsonal 
padlock that they lock on  to a numbered aluminium frame kept by the rail protection officer  or 
site protector when they are working on the track.  The padlocks are colour coded : green for 
the protector, orange for workers trained under Rule 902, blu e for visitors and workers who are 
not trained in the procedures (but are given instructions on arrival) and black for hi -rail vehicles 
and equipment on track.   
6.4. When a train needs to pass through a work area, and before the rail protection officer can 
authorise the train through the work area, all padlocks are removed from the frame while the 
workers are assembled in the safe place .   
6.5. A worksite  register is maintained by the rail protection officer  showing all people and vehicles 
within the worksite  at any  given time.   
6.6. The rail protection officer  is required to use a Work Area Tracking Board to display the status of 
each activity visually when managing a protected work area with multiple worksite s.   
6.7. The rail protection officer can only report  that the wor k area has been cleared when all 
padlocks have been removed and all personnel have signed off on the worksite register.   
6.8. KiwiRail has changed the bulletin application lead times to provide more time for checking and 
reviewing the application.  A quality a ssurance audit and monthly quality reporting have  been 
implemented for the production of bulletins.  
6.9. The NZ Transport Agency undertook a systems -focused investigation into the accident, which 
identified a number of deficiencies in the areas of:  
 training awareness  
 work planning and practices  
 communication on the worksite  
 the vulnerability of controls to procedural failures . 
6.10.  A comprehensive update of the actions the NZ Transport Agency  has taken to address the 
issues raised in the Commission 's draft recomme ndation  is included in  Appendix 7.

 7. Key l esson s 
7.1. Workers carrying out safety -critical tasks  can be placed in unsafe situations when standard 
operating procedures are not followed.  
7.2. Seatbelts are known to prevent injuries in vehicle accidents and shoul d always be worn where 
fitted.

 Final report RO -2014 -104 Appendix 7: Actions taken by the NZ Transport Agency  
On 14 September 2016, the Acting National Manager, Rail Safety, NZ Transport Agency stated in part:  
The Transport Agency undertook its own systems -focussed investigation into the 
hi-rail excavator accident at Raurimu in 2014. The purpose of that investigation 
was to identify any safety deficienci es in the rail transport system and/or 
practices connected with the collision that were relevant to KiwiRail's Safety 
Case and safety system. The investigation concluded that the failings sat within 
the following categories:  
1. Training awareness.  
2. Work  planning and practices.  
3. Communication on the work site.  
4. Vulnerability of controls to procedural failures.  
Following the Transport Agency's  investigation , it identified 11 improvements  
within these categories which it required KiwiRail to undertake.   These were:  
1. Staff training and procedures must ensure the responsibilities and authority of 
the Rail Protection Officer are clearly defined and implemented on -site. 
2. Training and compliance systems must ensure staff and contractor training is 
kept cu rrent.  
3. Site practices must enforce that only staff and contractors who have 
appropriate and current safety certification are permitted to operate at work 
sites.  
4. A system for easy identification and checking of staff qualifications at a work 
site must  be available to ensure staff and contractors have appropriate and 
current safety certification prior to commencing activities.  
5. Staff training must ensure staff understand the relevance of safety -critical 
practices and are prepared to challenge their co lleagues if they observe those 
practices being ignored.  
6. KiwiRail must review whether a single activity site was appropriate for the work 
area where the collision occurred and, if not, amend documentation, procedures 
and training as appropriate.  
7. Work planning forms must be maintained so they are always fit for purpose.  
8. A quality assurance programme must reliably ensure deviations in work 
planning and practices are identified and remediated early.  
9. There should be robust on -site communications prot ocols for track occupancy 
instructions.  
10. An independent layer of safety controls, such as enhanced track protection 
and lock out technology, should be investigated to increase protection against 
work site collisions.  
11. Comprehensive logs of work site activities must be available to aid with 
incident/accident investigation and audit purposes, such as recording of Channel 
1 (or other work group specific) radio calls.  
The Transport Agency requires KiwiRail to report on progress and it continues to 
monitor  progress into 2016.    
2015 Ordinary Safety Assessment:  
The KiwiRail 2015 Ordinary Assessment(audit) provided the Transport Agency 
with a further means to test the progress against the required improvements 
  
Final report AO-2014-104

 from the investigation. These were reviewed und er specific assessment themes 
related to:  
1. The Raurimu Accident  
2. Track Occupancy.  
1. Theme - Raurimu  
The 2015 Ordinary Safety Assessment identified that progress had been made 
against some of the required improvements noted in the Transport Agency's 
December 2014 investigation report.  However, as also noted under the Track 
Occupancy theme, there were remaining system weaknesses that need to be 
resolved.  
2. Theme - Track Occupancy  
The 2015 Ordinary Safety Assessment identified that KiwiRail had  develop ed a 
Track Occupancy Critical Risk network since the accident, with a corresponding 
strategic plan focussed toward eliminating track occupancy events.  
The Assessment revealed that significant numbers of both Infrastructure and 
Asset Management staff and co ntractors in some regions had overdue safety 
observations.   In addition, two of the sites visited demonstrated inappropriate 
application of track occupancy protection systems and ineffective Crew Resource 
Management.  Assessors noted that these two concern s mirrored an area of 
system failure that allegedly contributed to the Raurimu accident.  
Required  actions post 2015 Ordinary Safety Assessment:  
The 2015 Ordinary Safety Assessment, resulted in the following non compliances  
(NC) and recommendations  (R) bein g identified and provided to KiwiRail for 
subsequent action to be taken.  
The highlighted (see below list) non -compliances and recommendations have 
been raised specifically as 'remedial actions' to KiwiRail. These are non -
compliances and recommendations wh ich require remedial action pursuant to 
the Railways Act section 42 (1) (Notification of requirement for improvements).  
The Transport Agency is actively monitoring the progress of these open actions. 
Most have milestones and action plans which have been a greed to by KiwiRail 
and the Transport Agency.   
NC2 Safety observations and competency checks are not being completed for all 
KiwiRail staff within prescribed timeframes.  
NC3 Safety observations and competency are not being completed and managed 
for all c ontractor personnel within prescribed timeframes.  
NC4 Prescribed protection was not applied fully at work sites visited at Huntly 
and Kawerau Yard, and staff did not verify that it was safe to undertake tasks.  
NC5 No evidence of Lead Auditor technical (fie ld) competencies was available at 
the time of the assessment to determine suitability of person for the task or how 
they are linked with a technical expert. Closed  
R16 Track Occupancy risk management process could be enhanced with the 
inclusion of further risks (and associated mitigations) identified during the 
assessment. Due to be closed.   
R10 Develop a system for competency checks that over time ensures that all 
tasks a person has been deemed competent in are appropriately checked.  
R11 Network Services should consider introducing the enhanced planning 
practices observed in the Auckland Metro area across all the other areas.  
R12 When the component parts of track occupancy improvement are in place a 
consolidated internal audit of Track Occupancy is recomm ended to ensure that 

<< Page 42 >>
 Final report RO -2014 -104 the individual parts being checked are collectively achieving the desired 
outcome.     
R13 Consider setting more risk adverse likelihood frequency rates to better 
reflect the exposure rate for which mitigations need to apply.  
R14 Revie w the risk status of rules 908 and 401(d) to identify further controls to 
create a safety overlap to increase protection for track workers.  
R15 It is recommended that KiwiRail establish a clear process, and maintain the 
necessary records to readily demons trate that the required oversight and 
governance requirements for risk reviews are met.  
Conclusion:  
The Transport Agency proposes  that the information provided in this letter should 
demonstrate to the Commission that the regulator  has undertaken a robust 
review of this accident and the  KiwiRail system failings  which led to it -this 
includes  undertaking  an audit  of KiwiRail's processes and procedures.  
The Transport Agency also notes  that work is on -going  in this area  by KiwiRail to 
both fulfil the Transport A gency's required  improvements and also further 
address this area of its  operational risk.  We will continue to work with KiwiRail to 
ensure the improvements are fulfilled -as provided for and  required by the 
Railways Act 2005.
