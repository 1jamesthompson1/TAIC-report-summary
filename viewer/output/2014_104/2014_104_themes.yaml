- name: Communication Breakdown
  explanation: Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme related to this accident. The accident was precipitated by a "breakdown in communication at the work area assembly point" (4.2.3). The rail protection officer assumed that the work group overheard his authorization for the train to pass through the work area, and his 'thumbs up' signal was misinterpreted by the excavator driver as an indication to begin work (4.2.3, 4.2.4). This miscommunication directly led to the excavator being on the track when the train arrived, resulting in the collision.
- name: Non-Adherence to Safety Procedures
  explanation: Non-adherence to established safety procedures is another theme that is highly relevant to this accident. The report identifies "non-compliance with KiwiRail's procedures by the track maintenance work group and the network authority" (4.3.19). Specifically, the rail protection officer did not follow the correct procedure when extending the 'clear by' time for track occupation (4.3.12), and a pre-shift safety briefing, which is a KiwiRail operating rule, was not held on the day of the accident (4.3.10). These deviations from standard operating procedures contributed to the unsafe conditions that led to the accident.
- name: Inadequate Planning and Resourcing
  explanation: Inadequate planning and resourcing of the work group is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. The planning stage of the work assignment failed to follow KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures, resulting in the work group being under-resourced to manage the protection and safety of the track maintenance workers effectively (4.3.4-4.3.6). This lack of resources left the rail protection officer with the unrealistic task of managing the safety of all personnel within a 7.5-kilometre-long work area (4.3.6).
- name: Training and Certification Lapses
  explanation: Training and certification lapses are a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The excavator driver had not undergone a safety observation by KiwiRail personnel since 2010, and therefore his qualification was deemed to have expired (4.3.17). This lack of current certification and potentially inadequate training may have affected the excavator driver's understanding of safety protocols and contributed to the accident.
- name: Ineffective Use of Safety Equipment
  explanation: The ineffective use of safety equipment is a theme that emerged from this accident. The excavator driver was not wearing the seatbelt fitted to the excavator, which was confirmed by the train driver and the attending police officer (4.2.8). Had the seatbelt been worn, "the severity of his injuries would have been reduced" (4.2.8). This highlights the importance of using safety equipment properly to mitigate the consequences of accidents.
- name: Vulnerability to Procedural Failures
  explanation: The vulnerability of controls to procedural failures is a safety theme identified by the NZ Transport Agency's investigation into the accident (4.3.20). The investigation concluded that the failings fell into categories including "the vulnerability of controls to procedural failures" (4.3.20). This theme encompasses the various instances where procedures were not followed or were insufficient to prevent the accident, indicating a systemic issue with the robustness of safety controls in place.
