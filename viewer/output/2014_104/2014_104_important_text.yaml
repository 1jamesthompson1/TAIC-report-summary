  \   \n4.1.1.  The protection of work groups while they are maintaining the rail\
  \ tracks is a safety -critical \nprocess.  Any flaw in,  or lack of adherence to,\
  \ the processes for providing such protection can \nhave high consequences, as this\
  \ accident show ed.  \n4.1.2.  The driver of the northbound train followed the required\
  \ procedures and had the appropriate \nauthority before entering the work area.\
  \   The train was travelling at less than  the maximum \nspeed limit and the driver\
  \ did everything possible to prevent the collision when he saw  the \nexcavator\
  \ on the track ahead.  \n4.1.3.  The excavator should not have been occupying the\
  \ track at the time.  \n4.1.4.  The following analysis discusses what happened to\
  \ cause the collision between the train and \nthe excavator.  \n4.1.5.  Two safety\
  \ issues have been identified that contributed in some way to the collision.  \n\
  4.1.6.  The first is the process for protecting the work group .  It relied too\
  \ heavil y on the rail protection \nofficer being able to check the whereabouts\
  \ of every member of what was a large work group , \nand relied too heavily on the\
  \ assumption that all workers on site clearly understood when it \nwas safe for\
  \ them  to occupy the track.  \n4.1.7.  The sec ond safety issue is that notwithstanding\
  \ the weakness  in the process, the process  was \nnot adhered to , neither at the\
  \ planning stage nor in the implementation of the work plan.  \n4.2. What happened\
  \  \n4.2.1.  When the rail protection officer arrived back to where the work gr\
  \ oup was assembled he had \nno idea whether the southbound train had passed their\
  \ location.  \n4.2.2.  As it happened, the track was clear and the southbound train\
  \  had not yet passed through the \nwork area .   \n4.2.3.  It was a breakdown in\
  \ communication at the work area assembly point that led to the collision.  \nWhen\
  \ the driver of the northbound train requested permission to drive through the work\
  \ area, \nhe received the authority f rom the rail protection officer.  The rail\
  \ protection officer  then \nassumed that the members of the wor k group had overheard\
  \ him giving the train authority \nover the external loud speakers on the truck.\
  \  He then exited the truck and gave the group a \n'thumbs up ' signal.  \n4.2.4.\
  \  It is likely that the excavator driver interpreted this signal as indicating\
  \ that work  was about to \nbegin on the track.   He then walked around the curve\
  \ and on-track ed the excavator , which was \nout of sight of the work group.  \n\
  4.2.5.  The a uthority for the northbound train to enter the protected work area\
  \ was given some  time \nbetween 0903:09 , when the tra in stopped , and 0904:35\
  \ when it started to move again.  \n4.2.6.  Data from the train event recorder showed\
  \ a period of five  minutes and 15 seconds between  \nthe time the train entered\
  \ the protected work area and the collision.  This was sufficient time \nfor the\
  \ excavat or driver  to acknowledge the 'thumbs up ' signal  given by the rail protection\
  \ \nofficer , walk to the excavator and place it on the track ahead of the northbound\
  \ train.  It was \nvery likely that he had only just placed the excavator on the\
  \ track when the train rounded the \ncurve , because  he had not yet lowered the\
  \ hi -rail equipment onto the rails.  \n4.2.7.  The excavator driver had signed\
  \ a 'Permit to Work  Near Railway Power Lines ' that morning.  \nOne of the conditions\
  \ of the permit was that the overhead was 'alive', and th e electrical \nobserver\
  \ was required to be present when the excavator was operating on or near the track.\
  \  \nThe electrical observer was nowhere near the excavator at the time of the accident.\
  \  He was \n  \nFinal report AO-2014-104 \n<< Page 11 >>\n waiting for the northbound\
  \ train to pass and had stayed nea r his vehicle at the southern end \nof the curve\
  \ , which was out of sight of the excavator.  \n4.2.8.  The excavator driver  was\
  \ employed by Downer.  One of Downer's 10 'Cardinal Rules ' was \n\"NEVER  operate\
  \ a vehicle while using a handheld mobile phone nor without wearing a seatbelt \n\
  where fitted\".  There was no evidence that the excavator driver  was using a cell\
  \ phone at the \ntime.  However, he was not wearing the seatbelt that had been fitted\
  \ to the excavator.  This \nwas confirmed by the train driver and subsequently noted\
  \ b y the attending police officer.  The \nseatbelt had been placed behind the driver's\
  \ seat.  Had he been wearing his seatbelt it is \nlikely that  the severity of his\
  \ injuries would  have been reduced.  \nFindings : \n1 The northbound freight train\
  \ had been authorised to pass through the work \narea and at the time of the accident\
  \ was being driven at less than  the \nmaximum permitted  line speed.  \n2 The excavator\
  \ was not authorised to occupy the track at the time of the \naccident . \n3 It\
  \ is likely that the excavator driver thought he h ad been authorised to occupy\
  \ \nthe track and begin work when he was given a n ambiguous  'thumbs up' signal\
  \  \nby the rail protection officer.  \n \n \n4.3. Operating procedures  \nPlanning\
  \  \nSafety issue  - A failure by KiwiRail to follow its operating rules and procedures\
  \ at th e planning \nstage of the work assignment resulted in the work group being\
  \ under -resourced to manage the \nprotection and safety of the track maintenance\
  \ workers  effectively . \n4.3.1.  The application for the planned work between\
  \ National Park and Raurimu (see Appendix 1) \nwas submitted in a timely manner.\
  \  The submitter proposed that KiwiRail Track Safety Rule \n905, Compulsory Stop\
  \ Protection, be used to manage train movements through the planned \nwork area.\
  \  \n4.3.2.  The submitter identified that the planned work involved multiple activities\
  \ at multiple \nworksite s within the work area, and that a person certified for\
  \ safe working at a major work \narea ( KiwiRail Track Safety Rule 910) had been\
  \ arranged.  The team leader's name and his \ncell phone number were  recorded on\
  \ the application form as the 'Protection Person '.  \nHowever, it was not appropriate\
  \ for the team leader to fulfil the duties of the rail protection \nofficer  over\
  \ and above his main responsibility for the output and performance of the  work\
  \ \ngroup . \n4.3.3.  As set out in paragraph 3.4.4  the team leader was responsible\
  \ for leading, supervising and the \nefficient operation of the work group, and\
  \ for ensuring  that the work was carried out in a way \nthat complie d with all\
  \ \"KiwiRail Network quality, safety and engineering standards \". \n4.3.4.  The\
  \ role o f the rail protection officer was created in  response to protection issues\
  \ encountered \nat multiple worksites.  The role was formalised in September 2011\
  \ and more recently issued \nin KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules, effective from 6\
  \ October 2013 .  KiwiRail des cribed the rail \nprotection officer as the person\
  \ with overall responsibility for : \n\uF0B7 Providing rail protection for the Work\
  \ Area with one or multiple work sites  \n\uF0B7 Co-ordinating movement of rail\
  \ vehicles within and through the Protected \nWork Area  \n\uF0B7 Responsible fo\
  \ r communicating with Train Control  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2014\
  \ -104 4.3.5.  The planned work potentially involve d multiple activities within\
  \ a 7.5 -kilometre -long section of \ntrack .  KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 910\
  \ 'Work Arrangements - Multiple Activities'  required the \nrail protection officer\
  \ to a ppoint a site protect or at each  worksite within the protected work \narea\
  \ .   \n4.3.6.  The application  to KiwiRail Netwo rk Authorities did show that\
  \ the protected work area would \nbe managed under  KiwiRail Rule 910, 'Work Arrangements\
  \ - Multiple Activities '.  However, \nafter processing the application , Network\
  \ Authorities distributed the daily information bulletin \nwith the work area shown\
  \ as a single activity.   This removed the requirement for the rail \nprotection\
  \ officer to appoint site protectors at each worksite , leavi ng him with the unrealistic\
  \ \ntask of managing the protection and safety of all personnel within the entire\
  \ 7.5-kilometre -\nlong work area.  It also meant that , theoretically , the rail\
  \ protection officer required only a TPA \n1.1 qualification  (manage single worksite\
  \ s), which he held, rather than the TPA 1.3 \nqualification (manage multiple worksite\
  \ s), which he did not hold . \n4.3.7.  Another issue arose with the 'Application\
  \ for Traction Overhead Power Off' that was submitted \nto Network Authorit ies.\
  \  The application was err oneously made for the 1 ,500-volt DC \nWellington network\
  \ instead of the 25,000 -volt AC system present at the work area.  The error \n\
  went unnoticed and the application was approved.  \nAt the work area  \nSafety issue\
  \  - Numerous examples of non -compliance with KiwiR ail operating standards were\
  \ \nevident at the worksite , of which some were contributory to the accident .\
  \ \n4.3.8.  The day before this accident a pre -shift safety briefing was held.\
  \  Fourteen workers , including \nthe excavator driver , signed the 'Job Plan '\
  \ form to confi rm that they understood the hazards \nand controls in place.  However,\
  \ there was no register to record the names of the workers on \nsite, when they\
  \ arrived or when they departed.   This omission made it potentially more difficult\
  \ \nfor the pers on in charge of pr otecting the workers  to know with any certainty\
  \ whether all \npersons at the worksite  were accounted for (and off and clear of\
  \ the track) before allowing a \ntrain to enter the work area.  \n4.3.9.  Before\
  \ work commence d on site each day, all personnel, including contrac tors, were\
  \  required \nto participate in a pre -shift briefing and sign the 'Job Plan ' form\
  \ to confirm that they:  \n\uF0B7 knew where the safe place was  \n\uF0B7 understood\
  \ the track protection procedures in place for the day  \n\uF0B7 had been briefed\
  \  on and understood the relevant co ntent of the information bulletin  \n\uF0B7\
  \ understood the work area communications plan  \n\uF0B7 understood the emergency\
  \ procedures that had been communicated  \n\uF0B7 had been  made aware that a contractor\
  \ was operating a hi -rail excavator near the \noverhead line under the direct ion\
  \ of an electrical safety observer   \n\uF0B7 were fit for duty  \n\uF0B7 had considered\
  \ the prevention of slips and falls  \n\uF0B7 wore the personal protecti ve equipment\
  \ suitable for the tasks allocated . \n4.3.10.  However, on the day of the accident\
  \ a pre -shift briefing was not held .  The  reason given was  \nthat there was\
  \ no job plan booklet available.  The booklet  used the day before was provided\
  \ by \nthe local Ohakune track group , which  was not part of the work group th\
  \ is day.  There were six \nKiwiRail work vehicles parked within the work are a.\
  \  It would have been unusual for job plan \nbooklet s to be missing from all of\
  \ these vehicles.  Regardless of whether a job plan book let \nwas available, this\
  \ should not have prevent ed a safety briefing being held  and the 'safe place'\
  \ \nbeing designated .  \n  \nFinal report AO-2014-104 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.3.11.\
  \  A safety briefing would have reminded the excavator driver of two important points:\
  \ he should \nnot wander from the 'safe place' before receiving confirmation from\
  \ the rail protection officer  \nthat it was safe to begin work, and he should have\
  \ the electrical obse rver with him while \nworking near the electric traction overhead\
  \ line .   \n4.3.12.  Another example of non -compliance was w hen the rail protection\
  \ officer was establishing  the \nboards  protecting the work area.   He realised\
  \ that he would not clear the limits of his trac k \noccupation within the authorised\
  \ 'clear by ' time, so he radioed train control for additional time.  \nInstead\
  \ of cancelling the authority and completing a new form, the rail protection officer\
  \  \ncrossed out the previously recorded times and substituted 0753 as the commence\
  \ time and \n0815 as the complete time.  KiwiRail procedures required that the original\
  \ track occupation \ncross -check be cancelled and a new authority issued and recorded\
  \ . \n4.3.13.  It was the rail protection officer's  belief that work had not started\
  \ before the accident  because \nhe had yet to give the work group authority to\
  \ occupy the track.  The Commission takes a \ndifferent view,  because : \n\uF0B7\
  \ the work had started when the work group began to assemble at the worksite from\
  \ 0700 \nonwards  and were exposed to the potential risks  \n\uF0B7 the rail protection\
  \ officer was given authority from train control to establish the protected \nwork\
  \ area at 0738  \n\uF0B7 the driver of the hi -rail excavator was given permission\
  \ to on-track his digger , follow the \nrail protection officer's hi -rail v ehicle\
  \ and off -track his vehicle within the protected work \narea  \n\uF0B7 the rail\
  \ protection officer gave the drivers of a southbound train and a northbound train\
  \ \npermission to pass through the protected work area.  \n4.3.14.  Although the\
  \ protected work area was being operate d as a single worksite at the time of the\
  \ \naccident, the rail protection officer was about  seven kilometres away from\
  \ the work group \nwhen he authorised the first (southbound) train to enter the\
  \ protected work area .  Before  \ngiving that verbal authority to th e train driver\
  \ by radio, he had sought and received \nconfirmation by radio that all members\
  \ of the work group and machines were clear of the \ntrack.  However, the person\
  \ providing this confirmation was neither a dedicated rail protection \nofficer\
  \ nor a 'site protector' who would normally have been appointed for each individual\
  \ \nworksite had more than one existed within the protected work area.  \n4.3.15.\
  \  Since this accident KiwiRail has introduced a new 'lock -out' procedure to ensure\
  \ that all track \nworkers are accounted f or before trains are permitted to enter\
  \ a work area. As a result of the \nactions taken by KiwiRail to address this issue\
  \ no recommendation has been made.  Refer \nSection 6 and Appendix 6.  \nQualifications\
  \  \n4.3.16.  KiwiRail operating procedures required that anyone ca rrying out safety\
  \ -critical tasks be \nappropriately trained and undertake biennial theory assessments\
  \ as well as undergo three \npractical assessments within a 24 -month period.  These\
  \ assessments had to  also be carried \nout on contractors who held operating cer\
  \ tificates.   \n4.3.17.  The driver  of the hi -rail excavator had the TPA theory\
  \ qualification.  However, he had not \nundergone a safety observation by KiwiRail\
  \ personnel since 24 November 2010 and therefore \nhis qualification was deemed\
  \ to have expired.  Neither the tea m leader nor the rail protection \nofficer had\
  \ the means to determine the status of the contractor's operating qualifications\
  \ \nbecause the records were maintained remotely .  The Commission has previously\
  \ made a \nrecommendation to address this issue in its repo rt 11 -1038.  That recommendation\
  \ still has \n                                                        \n8 Commission\
  \ Report 11 -103, Track work ers nearly struck by passenger train near Paekakariki,\
  \ North Island \nMain Trunk, 25 August 2011.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report RO\
  \ -2014 -104 an open status pending confirmation from KiwiRail that the intent of\
  \ the recommendation has \nbeen met . \nSummary  \n4.3.18.  There are several examples\
  \ given above of non -adherence to KiwiRail procedures for planning \ntrack ma intenance\
  \ , setting up a work area , and protecting track workers from injury while they\
  \ \nare working.  Some of the non -adherence s to standard operating practices were\
  \ factors that \ncontributed to the accident . \n4.3.19.  Non-compliance with KiwiRail's\
  \ procedures by the track maintenance work group and the \nnetwork authority is\
  \ a safety issue .   \n4.3.20.  The NZ Transport Agency conducted its own system\
  \ -focused investigation into this accident in \norder to identify any safety deficiencies\
  \ that were relevant to KiwiRail's Safety Case and safety \nsystem  (refer Section\
  \ 6, Safety actions ).  The investigation concluded that the failings sat \nwithin\
  \ the following categories:  \n\uF0B7 training awareness  \n\uF0B7 work p lanning\
  \ and practices  \n\uF0B7 communication at the worksite  \n\uF0B7 the vulnerability\
  \ of controls to procedur al failures . \n4.3.21.  The NZ Transport Agency required\
  \ KiwiRail to make improvements in 11 areas of its worksite \nactivities.  In view\
  \ of the safety actions taken by the NZ Transport Agency , the Commission has \n\
  not made a recommendation to address this safety issue.  \nFindings : \n4 The work\
  \ plan for the day  was not effectively communicated to the work group, \nincluding\
  \ the excavator driver, which was a factor contributing to the accident.  \n5 Operational\
  \ p lanning was not done in accordance with KiwiRail 's standard \noperating pro\
  \ cedures .  Inadequate resourcing compromised the safety and \nprotection of the\
  \ track maintenance work group.  \n6 By not holding a safety briefing before work\
  \ started, as was required by \nKiwiRail operating rules, the work group was not\
  \ made aware of the 'safe \nplace' where personnel and equipment were to remain\
  \ until the rail protection \nofficer authorised work to resume.  \n \n \n 5. Findings\
  \  \n5.1. The northbound freight train had been authorised to pass through the work\
  \ area and at the \ntime of the accident was being driven at less than  the maximum\
  \ permitted line speed.  \n5.2. The excavator was not authorised to occupy the track\
  \ at the time of the accident.  \n5.3. It is likely that the excavator driver thought\
  \ he had been authorised to occupy the track and \nbegin work when he was given\
  \ a n ambi guous  'thumbs up' signal by the rail protection officer.  \n5.4. The\
  \ work plan for the day was not effectively communicated to the work group, including\
  \ the \nexcavator driver, which was a factor contributing to the accident.  \n5.5.\
  \ Operational planning was not done in acc ordance with KiwiRail's standard operating\
  \ \nprocedures.  Inadequate resourcing compromised the safety and protection of\
  \ the track \nmaintenance work group.  \n5.6. By not holding a safety briefing before\
  \ work started, as was required by KiwiRail operating \nrules, the  work group was\
  \ not made aware of the 'safe place' where personnel and equipment \nwere to remain\
  \ until the rail protection officer authorise d work to resume.   \n 6. Safety a\
  \ ctions  \nGeneral  \n6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types\
  \ : \n(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety\
  \ issues identified \nby the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result\
  \ in the Commission \nissuing a recommendation  \n(b) safety  actions taken by the\
  \ regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that \nwould not normally\
  \ result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  \nSafety a ctions  addressing\
  \ safety issues identified during an inquiry  \n6.2. KiwiRail's operating Rule 910\
  \ , 'Work Arrangements Multiple Activities' , has been discontinued \nand replaced\
  \ by Rule 902 , 'Managing a Protected Work Area'.  KiwiRail published revised Track\
  \ \nSafety Rules, Issue 3, effective from 30 June 2015.  The revision included new\
  \ site safety Rule \n902, Managing a Protected Work Area (see Appendix 6 ).    \n\
  6.3. Rule 902, ref erred to as a 'Lock on, lock off ' procedure, was developed to\
  \ ensure that a \nprotected work area is clear of personnel and machinery before\
  \ trains are authorised to enter.  \nAll workers, including contractors and visitors,\
  \ are required to carry a coloured pe rsonal \npadlock that they lock on  to a numbered\
  \ aluminium frame kept by the rail protection officer  or \nsite protector when\
  \ they are working on the track.  The padlocks are colour coded : green for \nthe\
  \ protector, orange for workers trained under Rule 902, blu e for visitors and workers\
  \ who are \nnot trained in the procedures (but are given instructions on arrival)\
  \ and black for hi -rail vehicles \nand equipment on track.   \n6.4. When a train\
  \ needs to pass through a work area, and before the rail protection officer can\
  \ \nauthorise the train through the work area, all padlocks are removed from the\
  \ frame while the \nworkers are assembled in the safe place .   \n6.5. A worksite\
  \  register is maintained by the rail protection officer  showing all people and\
  \ vehicles \nwithin the worksite  at any  given time.   \n6.6. The rail protection\
  \ officer  is required to use a Work Area Tracking Board to display the status of\
  \ \neach activity visually when managing a protected work area with multiple worksite\
  \ s.   \n6.7. The rail protection officer can only report  that the wor k area has\
  \ been cleared when all \npadlocks have been removed and all personnel have signed\
  \ off on the worksite register.   \n6.8. KiwiRail has changed the bulletin application\
  \ lead times to provide more time for checking and \nreviewing the application.\
  \  A quality a ssurance audit and monthly quality reporting have  been \nimplemented\
  \ for the production of bulletins.  \n6.9. The NZ Transport Agency undertook a systems\
  \ -focused investigation into the accident, which \nidentified a number of deficiencies\
  \ in the areas of:  \n\uF0B7 training awareness  \n\uF0B7 work planning and practices\
  \  \n\uF0B7 communication on the worksite  \n\uF0B7 the vulnerability of controls\
  \ to procedural failures . \n6.10.  A comprehensive update of the actions the NZ\
  \ Transport Agency  has taken to address the \nissues raised in the Commission 's\
  \ draft recomme ndation  is included in  Appendix 7.   \n \n  \n  \nFinal report\
