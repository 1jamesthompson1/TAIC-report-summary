","0.0","25.0","The master of L'Austral made a critical error by not noticing that the ship had moved too far to the west and entered an area with known navigational hazards, leading to contact with an uncharted rock. This error was compounded by assumptions about the safety of the area and the capabilities of the vessel. ""The master had made a mental note to avoid the area of overfalls, eddies and breakers depicted on the charts for the area south of Alert Stack. However, while the master was very likely focused on the recovery of the RHIBs, he did not notice that the ship had moved so far to the west, entered this area and made contact with the uncharted rock"" (4.2.4).
","0.0","1.667","While there were issues with the navigation officer's training, the report does not directly attribute the accident to a lack of training and competency in general. The navigation officer had completed the required training, although refresher training could have been beneficial (4.4.9).
","2.887","15.0","The crew's lack of familiarity with the ECDIS and its capabilities contributed to the accident. ""The electronic chart display and information system was the primary means of navigation on board L'Austral, yet the operating crew were not fully familiar with the capabilities and the limitations of the equipment, and were not making best use of it"" (5.8).
","0.0","20.0","The bridge team did not effectively use bridge resource management principles, leading to a lack of shared understanding and communication regarding the vessel's positioning and the recovery of the RHIBs. ""The bridge audio recording from the voyage data recorder revealed little effective communication between the master and the navigation officer while they were on the bridge in the 20-minute period prior to the grounding"" (4.3.4). Additionally, there was an indication that bridge team members were reluctant to intervene with the actions of the master (4.3.7).
","0.0","13.333","The vessel's voyage planning and conduct of navigation did not adhere to IMO standards or industry guidelines, and the bridge team did not follow the operator's safety management system requirements for safe manning during manoeuvring (4.3.2, 4.3.3).
","2.887","5.0","The operator's misunderstanding of the ECDIS safety parameters and the provision of unofficial ENCs indicate a lack of a strong safety culture that emphasizes understanding and effectively using safety equipment. ""The prescribing of permanent safety parameters indicated that there was not a clear understanding of how the parameters could best be used to improve safety in different navigational situations"" (4.4.14).
","0.0","10.0","The Department of Conservation did not apply sufficient maritime expertise in assessing the risks to ships and the environment when granting the coastal permit, which allowed L'Austral to navigate up to 300 meters from the shoreline without a formal risk assessment (4.5.4, 5.9).
","0.0","5.0","The operator and the bridge team did not fully comply with the coastal permit conditions, which prohibited L'Austral from operating within 300 meters of the shoreline. ""The operator was not permitted to operate L'Austral within 300 m of the shoreline under the conditions of its coastal permit"" (4.2.5).
","0.0","5.0","The master's situational awareness was compromised due to focusing on multiple tasks, which led to a loss of awareness of the vessel's position relative to navigational hazards. ""It is very likely that the master became focused on these activities to the detriment of maintaining situational awareness"" (4.3.5).
","0.0","0.0","The report does not discuss emergency response preparedness as a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication in the report that maintenance or inspection regimes were a factor in the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not indicate that the use of automation was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","Weather conditions were suitable and did not contribute to the accident. ""The predicted and actual weather conditions were suitable for conducting passenger RHIB excursions off North East Island"" (4.1.1).
","0.0","0.0","Although there was a lack of effective communication on the bridge, this is covered under the Crew Resource Management theme.
