Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate voyage planning and bridge resource management: The voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management on the bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the IMO standards or follow the guidelines published in other leading industry publications. This lack of proper planning and communication contributed to the vessel making contact with the uncharted rock.

2. Ineffective use of electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS): The operation of L’Austral’s ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator’s safety management system. The crew was not fully familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the ECDIS and did not make best use of it, leading to a failure in monitoring the ship's position and potential dangers.

3. Insufficient maritime expertise in assessing risks: The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing the risks to ships and the environment. This lack of expertise led to the granting of a coastal permit without conducting a formal risk assessment, allowing the ship to navigate in an area where it was not authorized and where there were potential navigational hazards.
