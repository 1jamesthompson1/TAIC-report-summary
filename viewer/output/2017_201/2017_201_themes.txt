Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Inadequate voyage planning and bridge resource management: The voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management on the bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the IMO standards or follow the guidelines published in other leading industry publications. There was a lack of communication and agreement on the plan between the master and the navigation officer, leading to a lack of situational awareness and failure to avoid the uncharted rock.

2. Ineffective use of electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS): The operation of L’Austral’s ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator’s safety management system. The ECDIS was not being used to its full potential, with the bridge team not fully familiar with its capabilities and limitations. The ECDIS parameters were not properly configured to provide adequate warnings and alarms, and the use of an unofficial ENC contributed to the lack of accurate chart information.

3. Insufficient maritime expertise in assessing risks: The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing the risks to ships and the environment. The department granted a coastal permit allowing L’Austral to navigate up to 300 meters from the shoreline without conducting a formal risk assessment using appropriate maritime expertise. This lack of expertise and assessment contributed to the vessel entering an unauthorized zone and making contact with the uncharted rock.
