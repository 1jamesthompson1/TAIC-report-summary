- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The master of L'Austral lost situational awareness, which was a significant contributing factor to the accident. "The master succumbed to the normal human tendency to become focused on the task at hand and he lost awareness of the bigger picture, specifically where his ship was in relation to navigational hazards" (4.3.8). Additionally, "the master was focused on three activities" to the detriment of maintaining situational awareness (4.3.5).

- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Human error played a role in the accident, as the master did not notice the ship had moved into an area to be avoided and made contact with an uncharted rock (4.2.4). Error management was also lacking, as there was no agreed plan or effective communication on the bridge to detect and remedy errors (4.3.1, 4.3.4).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's safety management system did not ensure that the voyage planning and bridge resource management met IMO standards (4.3), and the ECDIS operation did not meet good practice (4.4). These organizational influences affected the safety culture and contributed to the accident.
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management

This led to a situation where the bridge team members were reluctant to intervene with the actions of the master (4.3.7).
