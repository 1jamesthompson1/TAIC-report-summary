- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The report highlights significant issues with communication and crew resource management. "The bridge audio recording from the voyage data recorder revealed little effective communication between the master and the navigation officer" (4.3.4). Additionally, "there was no agreement of a plan and nothing in the way of expectations from the master to the navigation officer and nothing in return from her" (4.3.4). This lack of effective communication and resource management was a contributing factor to the accident.

- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report indicates that the vessel "was not permitted to operate L'Austral within 300 m of the shoreline under the conditions of its coastal permit" (4.2.5), and yet it did so. This breach of regulatory compliance indicates a safety management issue, contributing to the accident.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The master's loss of situational awareness was a significant contributing factor. "The master was very likely focused on the recovery of the RHIBs, he did not notice that the ship had moved so far to the west, entered this area and made contact with the uncharted rock" (4.2.4). This lack of situational awareness directly led to the vessel entering an area it was meant to avoid and making contact with the rock.
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0

    '
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The Department of Conservation did not conduct a formal risk assessment with appropriate maritime expertise when granting the coastal permit (4.5.4), and the vessel's ECDIS was not used to its full potential to manage navigation risks (4.4.19). These shortcomings in risk assessment and management contributed to the accident.

    '
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Human error played a significant role in the accident. The master's decision-making and the navigation officer's monitoring were flawed, as "there was no briefing from the master, the navigation officer had no clear understanding of where the master planned to position the vessel" (4.3.6). This lack of error management contributed to the accident.
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 0
