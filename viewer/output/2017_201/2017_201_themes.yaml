- name: Voyage Planning and Navigation Conduct
  explanation: 'Voyage planning and navigation conduct is a critical safety theme as it involves the preparation and execution of a ship''s route to ensure safe passage. In the case of L''Austral, the voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management did not meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards or the guidelines published in other leading industry publications ("Voyage planning and conduct of navigation" section). This inadequacy in planning and execution led to the vessel inadvertently entering a 300-metre exclusion zone and making contact with an uncharted rock ("Findings" section 5.1, 5.2). The master and navigation officer failed to maintain situational awareness and did not have an agreed plan or effective communication, which are essential components of bridge resource management ("Bridge resource management" section 4.3.1-4.3.8).

- name: ECDIS Operation and Chart Accuracy
  explanation: 'The operation of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) and the accuracy of the charts used are vital for safe navigation. In this incident, L''Austral''s ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator''s safety management system ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)" section). The ECDIS was loaded with an unofficial ENC, which had a lower Category Zone of Confidence (CATZOC) than the paper chart, indicating a lower level of confidence in the data ("Chart accuracy" section 4.4.1-4.4.5). Additionally, the bridge team was not fully familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the ECDIS and did not make the best use of it, which contributed to the vessel entering an unauthorized zone ("Findings" section 5.7, 5.8).

- name: Bridge Resource Management
  explanation: 'Bridge resource management involves the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, procedures, and equipment, to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel. In the case of L''Austral, the standard of bridge resource management did not meet good industry practice. There was a lack of effective leadership, communication, and a shared understanding of the navigation plan on the bridge, which are key aspects of bridge resource management ("Bridge resource management" section 4.3.1). The master''s focus on recovering the RHIBs and the navigation officer''s uncertainty about the master''s intentions due to a lack of briefing led to a situation where the vessel''s position was not adequately monitored, resulting in the grounding ("Findings" section 5.6).

- name: Crew Training and Familiarity with Navigation Systems
  explanation: 'Proper crew training and familiarity with navigation systems are essential for the safe operation of a vessel. The navigation officer on L''Austral had received type-specific training for the ECDIS in-house, which may not have been adequate, and did not comply with the IMO standard. Furthermore, after spending 20 months ashore, there was a strong case for refresher training to ensure full familiarity with the ECDIS, which did not occur ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)" section 4.4.8-4.4.9). This lack of training and familiarity likely contributed to the ineffective use of the ECDIS and the subsequent accident.

- name: Risk Assessment and Maritime Expertise
  explanation: 'Conducting formal risk assessments using appropriate maritime expertise is crucial for ensuring the safety of navigation and protecting the environment. The Department of Conservation granted a coastal permit allowing L''Austral to navigate up to 300 metres from the shoreline without conducting a formal risk assessment and without sufficient maritime expertise to assess the risks to ships and the environment ("Department of Conservation permits" section 4.5.4, "Findings" section 5.9). This oversight allowed the vessel to operate in a potentially hazardous area without the necessary risk controls in place, leading to the grounding.

- name: Compliance with Maritime Regulations and Permits
  explanation: Adherence to maritime regulations and permits is a fundamental aspect of maritime safety. L'Austral was not permitted to operate within 300 metres of the shoreline under the conditions of its coastal permit, yet it made contact with an uncharted rock closer than 300 metres to the shore ("What happened" section 4.2.5). This breach of the coastal permit and the ship entering an area where the master had decided not to take it are indicative of a safety issue with the standard of planning and bridge resource management ("What happened" section 4.2.8).
