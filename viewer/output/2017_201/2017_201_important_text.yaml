  \  \n4.1.1.  The operator of L'Austral  had first begun offering its sub-Antarctic\
  \  island cruise in 2015.  The \nmaster had previous operating experience in the\
  \ area.  The operator  held all of the necessary \npermits required from the Department\
  \ of Conservation  (see section 4.5) and had up -to-date \npaper and electronic\
  \ charts for the area .  The predicted and actual weather conditions were \nsuitable\
  \ for conducting passenger RHIB excursions off North East Island .  \n4.1.2.  The\
  \ rock with which  L'Austral made contact was uncharted, having not been detected\
  \ during a  \nhydrographic survey of the islands in 1999 .   \n4.1.3.  The following\
  \ analy sis discusses  the circumstances that led to the vessel making contact with\
  \ the \nuncharted rock.  Also discussed is one contributing and two non -contributing\
  \ safety issues : \n\uF0B7 the voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands\
  \ and the standard of bridge resource \nmanagement o n the bridge leading up to\
  \ the contact  did not meet the  IMO standards  or follow \nthe guidelines published\
  \ in other leading industry publications  \n\uF0B7 The operation  of L'Austral's\
  \ ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance \nor the standards\
  \ set out in the operator's safety management system.  \n\uF0B7 The Department of\
  \ Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing the \nrisks\
  \ to ships and the environment.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  L'Austral's  passengers\
  \ had  been cruising the east coast of North East Island  in RHIBs  on the \nmorning\
  \ of 9 January.  \n4.2.2.  The weather was likely to be too uncomfortable for the\
  \ passengers in the afternoon , so the RHIBs \nneeded to be stowed  back on  board\
  \ the vessel .  To pick up the RHIBs from the south of the island \nthe navigation\
  \ officer first had to plan a route to the position where the vessel  would meet\
  \ the \nRHIBs.  This plan consisted of six waypoint s on the ECDIS and three p arallel\
  \ indexes16 created on \nthe radar.  These tools allowed the navigation officer\
  \ to monitor the vessel 's progress on the \nroute and make any corrections needed\
  \ if the vessel  deviated from the plan.  \n4.2.3.  When  L'Austral arrived at the\
  \ south bay, t he master  began  manoeuvring the vessel  in order to \nfacilitate\
  \ the recovery of the RHIBs  in the shelter provided by the South Promontory of\
  \ the island \n(see Figure 3).  There were  only two people on the bridge - the\
  \ master and the navigati on officer.  \nOnce the master took control of the ship\
  \  there was no agreed plan for where the vessel was to be \nor any areas to be\
  \ avoided . \n4.2.4.  The master had made a mental note to avoid the area of overfalls\
  \ , eddies and breakers depicted \non the charts for the area south of Alert Stack.\
  \   However , while  the master was  very likely  focused \non the recovery of the\
  \ RHIBs , he did not notice that the ship had moved so far to the west , \nentered\
  \ this area and made contact with the uncharted rock . \n4.2.5.  The operator was\
  \ not permitted to operate  L'Austral within 300 m of the shoreline under the \n\
  conditions of its coastal permit.  The uncharted rock with which L'Austral made\
  \ contact was \ncloser than 300  m to the shore.  \n4.2.6.  Although the rock was\
  \ un charted, the  description of the waters and the charted depth contours in \n\
  the area were warning enough for operators of ships the size of  L'Austral to give\
  \ it a wide berth.  \n                                                        \n\
  16 An offset electronic navigation  line(s) set up on a radar screen parallel to\
  \ a ship's heading , used to monitor \nthe ship's distance from prominent points.\
  \  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -201 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2.7.  The position of the\
  \ uncharted rock was calculated from the GPS (global positioning syst em) \nposit\
  \ ion recorded in the ship 's voyage data recorder17. The horizontal accuracy of\
  \ the GPS was \nrecorded as being \xB10.9 m. The hull penetration was 52  m behind\
  \ the GPS antenna. It was very \nlikely that the uncharted rock was within the 300\
  \  m exclusion zone.  \n4.2.8.  The un intentional breach of the coastal permit\
  \ and the ship entering an area where the master \nhad decided not to take it are\
  \ indicative of a safety issue with the standard of planning and \nbridge resource\
  \ management.  This is discussed in the following section . \n \n4.3. Voyage planning\
  \ and c onduct of n avigation   \nSafety issue - The voyage planning for the time\
  \ in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge \nresource management on the\
  \ bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the IMO standards  or \nfollow the\
  \ guidelines published in other leading industry publications . \nBridge resource\
  \ management  \n4.3.1.  To work together effectively on a bridge, it is crucial\
  \ that the bridge team uses effective  bridge \nresource management (sometimes referred\
  \ to as non-technical skills).  L eadership and \ncommunication  are important aspects\
  \ of bridge resource management .  The bridge team are to \nbuild a shared understanding\
  \ of what the plan is and how it is to be implemented.  In that way \nany deviations\
  \ from the plan ca n be challenged and errors can be detected and remedied without\
  \ \nan accident occurring . \n4.3.2.  The recovery of the RHIBs so close to the\
  \ shore would normally be considered 'manoeuvring'.  \nThe operator's safety management\
  \ system detail ed the safe manning for the br idge when \nmanoeuvring  as \"Master\
  \ and Staff Captain, and one qualified navigational watch keeping rating\". \nThe\
  \ safety management system  describe d this as three individuals sharing the workload\
  \ to \nensu re safe navigation and lookout.  \n4.3.3.  At the time of the accide\
  \ nt there were  just the master and the navigati on officer  on th e bridge, \n\
  less than the required complement .  Notwithstanding the operator's bridge manning\
  \ \nrequirements, the task could still have been achieved safely had the master\
  \ and navigation \nofficer had  an agreed plan and been  communicating effectively.\
  \  \n4.3.4.  However, t he bridge audio recording from the voyage data recorder\
  \ revealed little effective \ncommunication between the master and the navigation\
  \ office r while they were on the bridge in \nthe 20-minute perio d prior to the\
  \ grounding .  There was no agreement of a plan and nothing in \nthe way of expectations\
  \ from the master to the navigation officer and nothing in return from  her. \n\
  \ \n                                                        \n17 A computer system\
  \ containing a record of a vessel 's operation and configuration for the purpose\
  \ of accident \ninvestigation.  Finding s \n1. L'Austral inadvertently entered a\
  \ 300 -metre exclusion zone , which  the ship was \nnot authorised to enter and\
  \ in which the chart s noted the existence of overfalls , \neddies and breakers.\
  \  \n2. L'Austral made contact with an uncharted rock  inside the 300 -metre exclusion\
  \ \nzone.  \n3. The uncharted rock was in an area the Commission considers would\
  \ not be \nsuitable for the safe navigation of ships the size of  L'Austral  without\
  \ having a \nhigh level of confidence in the accuracy of available hydrographi c\
  \ information.  \n \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -201 4.3.5.  Prior\
  \ to the grounding the master was focused on three activities :  \n\uF0B7 recovering\
  \ the  RHIBs.  \n\uF0B7 communicating  with the staff captain at  the marina . \n\
  \uF0B7 manoeuvring the vessel . \nIt is very likely that the master became  focused\
  \ on  these activities to the detriment of  maintaining  \nsituational awareness.\
  \  \n4.3.6.  The navigation officer  was responsible for monit oring the vessel\
  \ 's progress, ensuring the master's \nactions had the desired effect s, and challenging\
  \  the actions of the master if necessary.  Because \nthere was no briefing from\
  \ the master , the navigation officer had no clear understanding of where \nthe\
  \ master planned to position the vessel, so she was unsure of what and when to challenge.\
  \  \n4.3.7.  During interview s with  the crew there was an indication that bridge\
  \ team members were reluctant \nto intervene with the actio ns of the master . \n\
  4.3.8.  Such a reluctance to intervene  is contrary to the principle s of good bridge\
  \ resource management.  \nIt leaves the ship vulnerable to one -person errors resulting\
  \ in accidents .  In this case the master \nsuccumbed to the normal human tendency\
  \ to become focused on the task at hand  and he lost \nawareness of the bigger picture\
  \ , specifically  where his ship was in relation to navigational \nhazards.  Situations\
  \ like this are easily rectified using a team approach , where the team share a\
  \ \ncommon plan.  \nRadar  \n4.3.9.  Figure 7 shows a screengrab18 captured from\
  \ the  primary radar at the time of the accident. The \ndashed ring labelled 'variable\
  \ range marker  1' was set at 300  m or 0.162 nautical miles to help \nensure the\
  \ vessel did not go within 300 m of the shoreline as defined in the operator's \
  \ coastal \npermit.  The master was surprise d to learn that  L'Austral had breached\
  \ the 300  m limit.  This is \nexplainable because the  centre of the 300  m circle\
  \ is the radar scanner , which is positioned \nabove the bridge.  The distance from\
  \ the radar scanner to the stern is abo ut 90 m.  For the \nvariable range marker\
  \  to have been  used as a useful monitor to ensure the vessel did not go \nwithin\
  \ 300  m of the shoreline, it would  have been appropriate to set it to at least\
  \ 390  m. \n4.3.10.  The radar was set to a 1.5 -nautical -mile range  scale . \
  \ Given the close proximity of the island , a \nsmaller range scale such as 0.75\
  \ nautical miles would have better aided position monitoring.  \n4.3.11.  While\
  \ the radar gave an indication of the ship's distance from  the shoreline, it alone\
  \ was not a \ndefinitive tool for continuously mo nitoring where the ship lay in\
  \ relation to navigation al hazards \nnot detectable by radar.  A more appropriate\
  \ tool for position  monitoring would have been the \nECDIS and the paper ch art.\
  \  The use of these is discussed below.  \n                                    \
  \                    \n18 A digi tal image taken of the radar and stored in the\

  \  L'Austral struck the submerged ro ck was surveyed in 1999 to a \xB150  m positional\
  \ \naccuracy and a \xB11.6  m depth accuracy.   Within these parameters it  was\
  \ possible that a rock \npinnacle would  not have been  captured.   The information\
  \ captured during this survey was used to \nproduce the paper chart NZ  2411 . \n\
  4.3.13.  The vessel 's primary means of navigation was the ECDIS , comprising a\
  \  primary unit and a back -\nup planning unit .  The operator 's safety management\
  \ system referred to  French law  requiring  \nL'Austral to have a paper  chart\
  \  back -up in addition to the secondary ECDIS unit.  However, the \noperator had\
  \ misinterpreted the legislation .  Article 221 -V/19 in French law state d that\
  \ back -up \ndevices for ECDIS s could  be paper or electron ic.  This was not a\
  \ safety issue as such, as the ship \nhad more than the minimum requirement, that\
  \  being a primary and a secondary ECDIS, and a \nfolio of paper charts .  All three\
  \ systems were up to date.  \n4.3.14.  The use of either the ECDIS or the paper\
  \ chart systems was acceptable, provided that the method \nwas compatible with the\
  \ situation.  There were issues with the way in which the ECDIS was being \nused\
  \ on board, which are discussed in the following section.  However, there were \
  \ also issues \nwith the way in which the paper charts were used.  \n4.3.15.  Figure\
  \ 8 shows two position fixes on the paper chart that was in use at the time of the\
  \ accident. \nThe operator 's safety management system  state d that  the officer\
  \ o f the watch shall \"plot the \nship's position on t he appropriate chart and\
  \ check at sufficiently frequent intervals dependi ng on \nthe prevailing conditions\

  vessel's  track \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -201 4.3.16.  The vessel\
  \ was manoeuvring very close to land, which  was a high -risk activity  requiring\
  \ precise \nnavigation techniques to monitor the vessel 's posit ion.  Approximately\
  \ 30 minutes passed \nbetween  the time the vessel arrived at the south bay and\
  \ the time the vessel struck the rock. \nPosition 2 was added after the navigation\
  \ officer  heard the sound of the impact.  P rior to this \nthere was only one \
  \ position marked on the chart.  \n4.3.17.  An activity requiring constant manoeuvring\
  \ of a ship close to a shoreline would normally be \nsubjected to almost constant\
  \ monitoring of the ship's position .  This can be achieved with a \ncombination\
  \ of monitoring by radar, backed up by frequent fixing of the ship's position on\
  \ a paper \nchart.  Apart from the position  fix at 1431 (see Figure 8) , the radar\
  \ was only being used to \nmonitor the  ship's  distance off the  shoreline to ensure\
  \ there was no breach of the coastal permit \nrestrictions, rather than to monitor\
  \ the ship's position in relation to navigational hazards.  \n4.3.18.  An ECDIS\
  \ is ideally suited to constantly monitoring a ship's position, provided it is properly\
  \ \nconfigured  and utilised .  \n \nFigure 8  \nExtract of paper chart NZ 2411,\

  \ visual repre sentation s of the accuracy  of underlying data . A table \ndetailing\
  \ the different CAT ZOC values can be found in Appendix 1.   \n4.4.2.  SOLAS20 chapter\
  \ V , regulation 2.2 describes  an electronic navigation chart (ENC) or paper chart\
  \  \nas one : \"issued officially by or on the  authority of a Government, authorized\
  \ Hydrographic Office \nor other relevant government institution and is designed\
  \ to meet the requirements of marine \nnavigation\". The operator had a responsibility\
  \ to ensure that all charts and ENC s delivered to the \nvessel  were  official\
  \ nautical publications.   \n4.4.3.  Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is the\
  \ recogni sed hydrographic office of New Zealand.  It \nproduces the paper chart\
  \ NZ 2411 and the raster  navigational chart21 NZ 241102 .  LINZ had not \ncreated\
  \  an ENC for the area of the Snares Islands  at the time of the accident . \n4.4.4.\
  \  The ECDIS on  board  L'Austral was loaded with an unofficial ENC for the Snares\
  \ Islands, which \nhad been  produced by C-MAP, a Norwegian company.   The C-MAP\
  \ ENC was derived from \npublished electronic raster navigational charts where the\
  \ local hydrographic office s had not \nproduced ENC s.  The ENC that was in use\
  \ at the ti me of the accident is shown in F igure 9.  The \nCATZOC U symbols denote\
  \ that the \"the quality of the bathymetric  data has yet to be assessed\"22.  \n\
  This low-confidence marker was also used as an indicator that it had not been  produced\
  \ by the \nlocal national hydrographic office, in this case L INZ.   \n4.4.5.  The\
  \ paper chart had a scale  of 1:25 ,000, and in the area of the accident the underlying\
  \ survey \ninformati on was assessed as having a CATZOC of B ; however,  the ENC\
  \ loaded in the ECDIS  at the \ntime of the accident  had a CATZOC of U . This discrepancy\
  \ was due to the CATZOC value denoting \nthat the ENC had been produced by an unofficial\
  \ source.     \n                                                        \n19 A visualisation\

  \ 9  \nPhotograph showing the CATZOC of the unofficial ENC loaded in  L'Austral's\
  \  ECDIS  \n \n4.4.6.  There is a requirement for shore -based personnel who have\
  \ a responsibility to outfit ships with \nECDIS ENCs to have undergone the IMO generic\
  \ ECDIS training , to ensure they are familiar with \nthe IMO requirements.  The\
  \ provision of the  C-MAP  chart portfolio  containing unofficial ENCs  for \nloading\
  \ into L'Austral's  ECDIS should have been accompanied by an alert , warning that\
  \ some of \nthe charts had not been produced by official hydrographic source s.\
  \ \n4.4.7.  The bridge team on  L'Austral did not appreciate that the CATZOC of\
  \ U shown on their ECDIS at the \ntime of the accident indicated that it had been\
  \  produced by C -MAP, not by LINZ .   \n4.4.8.  The master and deck officers  of\
  \ L'Austral had all received  IMO mandatory generic ECDIS training , \nand addition\
  \ ally they had completed type -specific training  for the Sperry VisionMaster FT\
  \ as fitted \nto the L'Austral .  The IMO requires this training to be supplied\
  \  by the ECDIS manufacturer, or its \ndesignated providers.  However , the navigation\
  \ officer  had received this training in -house from  a \ncaptain who had undergone\
  \ the manufacturer 's training .  This training may or may not have been \nadequate.\
  \  It met the French  flag requirement for type -specific  training ; however ,\
  \ it did not comply \nwith the IMO standard23.   \n4.4.9.  The navigation officer\
  \ had completed the type -specific training in April 2015, just prior to \nspending\
  \ 20 months ashore. The  International Safety Management ( ISM) Code  includes a\
  \ \nrequirement for operators to ensure that shipboard crew are thoroughly familiar\
  \ with the systems \nand equipment with which they are working.  T here had been\
  \  a strong case for the ship operator \nto arrange refresher training for the navig\
  \ ation officer before she joined L'Austral to ensure full \nfamiliarity with the\
  \ ECDIS.  There is no expiry date for type-specific training ; however , considering\
  \ \nthe complexity of  the ECDIS and that this officer had  had little opportunity\
  \ to utilise what she had \nlearnt,  it is likely that she would have benefited\
  \ from some refresher  training.  \n4.4.10.  The Sperry Vision Master FT ECDIS allows\
  \ the user to set safety parameters and configure  when a \nwarning alarm  will\
  \ be activated .  On L'Austral the master had stipulated that permanent ECDIS \n\
  safety parameter s were to be used ( see F igure 12).  By defining the safety parameters\
  \ the bridge \n                                                        \n23 IMO\

  \ to change the way that the ECDIS displayed or alarmed and were therefore \nconstrained\
  \ by the information and warnings it provid ed them.    \n4.4.11.  When a vessel\
  \ is operating offshore , the look -head time is usually  increased in recognition\
  \  that \nthe ship is navigating at a lower level of risk and to give the bridge\
  \ team longer to react to any \nhazards.  However, w hilst in coastal areas i t\
  \ is normal  to change the look -ahead to a shorter time \nperiod in recognition\
  \ that the navigati on officers are operating at a heightened level of vigilance\
  \ \nand to reduce the number of 'nuisance' alarms.   Similarly, when  operating\
  \ close to navigation al \nhazards the  look-ahead and shallow contour depth  should\
  \ be set relative  to the topography of the \nseabed to visualise change s in depths\
  \  and reduce the number of 'nuisance' alarms . \n4.4.12.  Alarms  are configured\
  \ by using a number of parameters , which  are explained i n Figures 10 and \n11.\

  \ \napproach .  However , the prescribing of permanent safety  parameters indicate\
  \ d that there was no t \na clear understanding of how the parameters could best\
  \ be used to improve safety in different \nnavigation al situations . \n4.4.15.\
  \  Prior to the accident the ECDIS did not alarm  because : \n\uF0B7 the rock that\
  \ the vessel struck was not charted  \n\uF0B7 the shallow contour was set at 6 \
  \ m \n\uF0B7 there was no user -defined prohibited area.  \nA warning could have\
  \ been configured to alarm and alert the bridge team that the vessel was \nentering\
  \ a potentially dangerous area.   \n4.4.16.  If the shallow contour  parameter had\
  \ been set to 30  m, the ECDIS would have displayed a \nwarning  or alarmed  when\
  \ the vessel  was predicted to cross the 30 m contour.  \n4.4.17.  There were no\
  \ prohibited areas defined in the  ECDIS  to the south of North East Island .  User\
  \ -\ndefined prohibited areas are areas where the navigation officer does not wish\
  \ the vessel to enter , \nsimilar to a no -go zone24 on a paper chart .  The master\
  \ said that he did not want the vessel to \nenter the area indicated in Figure 13\
  \ as the chart showed  the 'overfalls, eddies and breakers ' \nsymbol.  Had this\
  \ area been  identified as a no -go area , the ECDIS would have  alarmed as the\

  \ ship grounding.  \n4.4.19.  Although the ECDIS was designated as the ship's primary\
  \ navigation system, it was not being \nused as such and not being used to its full\
  \ potential.  It is likely that this was in part due to the \nconcept of ECDIS not\
  \ being fully understood by both the operator and the bridge team on the day.  \n\
  \ \n  \n Finding s \n7. The operator's system for providing and managing the provision\
  \ of the electronic \nchart display and information system  on board  L'Austral\
  \ did not meet the intent \nof the International Maritime Organi zation standards\
  \ . \n8. The electronic chart display and information system  was the primary means\
  \ of \nnavigation on board  L'Austral , yet the operating crew were not fully familiar\
  \ with \nthe capabilities and the limitations of th e equipm ent, and were not making\
  \ best \nuse of it . \n \noverfalls , \neddies \nand \nbreakers  \nvessel 's \n\

  \ Department of Conservation permits  \nSafety issue - The Department of Conservation\
  \ had insufficient maritime expertise applied to \nassessing the risk s to ships\
  \ and the environment.   \nTo operate the sub-Antarctic  cruise , that the operator\
  \ offered, it had to obtain three  types of \npermit from the Department of Conservation\
  \ : \n \nPermit Name  Permit Purpose  Valid for  \nConcession to operate \nin the\
  \ sub-Antarctic  \nislands  Allowed the operator  to conduct guided \nwalks up to\
  \ two times a year at approved \nsites, subject to the terms of the entry \npermit\
  \  6 years 3 months  \nCoastal permit  Allowed L'Austral access to the coastal \n\
  marine area of the sub-Antarctic  islands  by \na vessel longer  than 125  m, up\
  \ to 300  m \nfrom the shore  5 years 9 months  \nEntry permit to \nCampbell and\
  \ Auckland \nIsland nature reserves  Allowed L'Austral to land passengers on \n\
  these islands for guided walks within the \nnature reserves  1 year 3 months  \n\
  Table 1 \nDetai ls of Department of Conservation permits  \n4.5.1.  In January 2016\
  \  L'Austral had been  granted a coastal permit that prevented  it navigating within\
  \  \n600 m of the mean high water springs mark (the shoreline) of any sub-Antarctic\
  \  island.  The 600 \nm limit did not allow the vessel to enter harbours  at the\
  \ Auckland and Campbell Islands . As a \nresult  passengers  had to be transferred\
  \ from outside the harbour  limits  to the landing sites by \nRHIBs. The Proposed\
  \ Regional Coastal Plan for the sub-Antarctic  islands  included the table shown\
  \ \nin Figure 14 . \n \nFigure 14  \nExtract from Proposed Regional Coastal Plan:\
  \ Kermadec and sub-Antarctic  islands , Snares Islands   \n(at the time of the accident)\
  \  \n \n4.5.2.  The ship operator had become  concerned about the safety of trans\
  \ ferring passengers to  and from \nlanding sites in RHIBs  in what was sometimes\
  \ rough water , so in 2016 the company applied for a \nnew coastal permit , requesting\
  \  that the vessel be allowed to navigate up to 300  m from the \nshoreline.  This\
  \ would allow the ship to enter the harbours, thereby reduc ing passenger's \nexposure\
  \ to rough water . \n4.5.3.  As the relevant rules in the Proposed Regional Coastal\
  \ Plan had not come into force , the operator \ncould  apply for a discretionary\
  \ permit allowing the ship to navigate up to 300  m from the \nshoreline . This\
  \ would have been prohibited if the coastal plan had been in force .  Section \n\
  87B(1)(c) of the Resource Management Act  1991  states that if a rule is not in\
  \ operation , the \nactivity  \"it is to be treated as discretionary \". This mean\
  \ t that the operator could  apply for a coastal \npermit for any of the pro hibited\
  \ areas listed in Figure 14. \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -201 \n<< Page 23 >>\n\
  \ 4.5.4.  At the time the Department of Conservation  received the  application\
  \  from the operator for a new \ndiscre tionary coastal permit,  it had no internal\
  \  maritime  expertise to assess the  additional  risks to \nships and the environment\
  \ in allowing the ship to navigate up to 300  m from the  shoreline. The \nDepartment\
  \ of Conservation  had an informal agreement with a marit ime professional who \n\
  advised it that,  \"considering the capabilities of this modern vessel it is unlikely\
  \ that this activity \nposes a significant risk of a grounding incident \".  This\
  \ person  was contacted on an informal basis \nand was not employed by the Department\
  \ of Conservation .  No formal risk assessment  process \nwas conducted . \n4.5.5.\
  \  The Minister of Conservation (through the Department of Conservation ) has some\
  \ of  the \nresponsibilities, duties and powers that a regional council has under\
  \ the Resource Managemen t \nAct, in respect of the sub-Antarctic  islands25. \n\
  4.5.6.  When a regional council is responsible for a port or harbour it usually\
  \ appoint s a harbour master \nwho is responsible for enforcing regulations  and\
  \ ensuring , safe navigation and security.  Given \nthe potential ly harsh and sensitive\
  \ environment in the region, and the likelihood that shipping \nactivity will increase\
  \ in future, the Commission recommends  that the Department of Conservation  \n\
  appoint a suitably qualified person to manage the safety of navigation in the sub-Antarctic\
  \  \nislands . \n  \n                                                        \n\
  25 Resource Management Act 1991, section 31A(1)(a).  Finding  \n9. The Department\
  \ of Conservation  granted a coastal permit allowing  L'Austral  to \nnavigate up\
  \ to 300  metres from the shoreline  in all of the sub-Antarc tic islands , \nwithout\
  \ conducting a formal risk assessment using the appropriate maritime \nexpertise\
  \ to ensure that the necessary risk controls were in place.  \n \n \n\n<< Page 24\
