The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.   The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of o ccurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commiss ion carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. L'Austral was a French -registered passenger vessel that was operating a 16 -night cruise of 
New Zealand 's South Island , including its sub-Antarctic  islands .  On 7 January 2017 L'Austral 
sailed from Lyttelton with 200 passengers and 156 crew on board, bound for the Snares 
Islands , south of New Zealand . 
1.2. L'Austral  arrived off the Snares Islands early on the morning of 9 January 2017.  The 
passengers spent the morning making shoreline excursions in rigid-hulled inflatable boats , 
observing  the wildlife.  That afternoon the weath er became unsuitable for small -boat 
excursions , so L'Austral  rendezvoused with the boats in the sheltered water to the south of the 
islands to take them back on board.  
1.3. While t he master was focused on manoeuvring the ship to facilitate the safe recovery  of the 
rigid-hulled inflatable boats,  the ship  drifted into a 300 -metre  unauthorised zone, where it 
contacted an uncharted rock.  The rock pierced the hull in an empty void tank, which flooded 
with water.  The damaged compartment had little effect on the ship's stability, and the ship 
was a ble to continue to another sub-Antarctic island before returning to New Zealand for 
temporary repairs.  Nobody was injured.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that L'Austral 
inadvertently entered the 300-metre unauthorised  zone , which the ship was not permitted to 
enter and in which the chart s noted the existence of overfalls , eddies and breakers.  
1.5. The uncharted rock was in an area  that the Commission considers was not suitable for the 
safe navigation of ships the size of L'Austral . 
1.6. The Commission also found : that the activity to recover the ship's rigid -hulled inflatable boats 
was not well planned; that the ship's position was not being adequately monitored; and that 
the standard of bridge resource management on board  L'Austral did not meet good industry 
practice.  
1.7. The Commission identified three safety issues : 
 the voyage planning f or the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource 
management on the bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the International 
Maritime Organi zation standards  or follow the guidelines published in other leading 
industry publication s 
 the operation of L'Austral 's electronic chart display  and information system  did not meet 
good practice as defined in the  International Maritime Organi zation guidance  or the 
standards set out in the operator's safety management system  
 The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing 
the risks to ships and the environment.  
1.8. The Commission made two recommendations  to the operator to address the safety issues 
regarding the standards of voyage planning , the bridge resource management, and the 
training and use of electronic chart display and information systems.  
1.9. The Commission m ade one recommendation  to the Director -General  of the Department of 
Conservation that, given the potentially harsh and sensitive environment in the sub-Antarctic  
islands  and the likelihood that shipping activity will increase in future, he appoint a suitably 
qualified person to manage the safety of navigation in the sub-Antarctic  islands . 
1.10.  The key lessons  arising  from th is inquiry were : 
 an electronic chart display  and information system  is a valuable aid to navigation.  
However, mariners need to understand  fully and be familiar with all aspects of the system, 
otherwise relying on the electronic chart display  and information system  as a primary 
means of navigation can c ontribute to, rather than prevent , accidents  
 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -201  every part of a ship 's voyage must be planned , and all members of the bridge team must 
be fully  familiar with and agree to the plan . This  is a cornerstone of good bridge resource 
management  
 good bridge resource management relies on a culture where challenge is welcomed and 
responded to , regardless of rank, personality or nationality .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was advised of the accident  
by email from Maritime New Zealand on 13 January 2017, four days after the occurrence.  
The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990,  and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 13 Janu ary 2017 two investigators deployed to Bluff where  L'Austral had berthed  the 
previous day.   The t wo investigators interviewed the master and gathered perishable evidence.  
2.3. On 13 January  2017  contact was established with the Bureau d 'Enquêtes sur les Événements 
de Mer, (BEAmer)  the French safety investigation authority. It was agreed  that New Zealand 
would lead the marine safe ty investigation  in accordance with  the International Maritime 
Organization  (IMO) Casualty Investigation Code , Chapter 7.  
2.4. On 14 January 2017  L'Austral had temporary repairs completed  and was cleared by Maritime 
New Zealand  to sail .  
2.5. On 24 January 2017 t wo investigators met  L'Austral when it berthed  in Dunedin. They 
conducted further interviews with  the master,  the officer of the watch2 and the chief engineer.  
2.6. On 3 April 2017 and 4 May 2017 two investigators interviewe d Department of Conservation 
employees in relation to permits granted to  L'Aust ral. 
2.7. On 26 October 2017  the Commission approved the draft report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment . 
2.8. The draft report was circulated to nine interested persons.  Seven responses were received.  
2.9. The Commission considered these submissions in detail and any changes as a result have 
been included in the final report.  
2.10.  The Commission approved the final report for publication on 21 February 2018.

3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  L'Austral was a French -registered passenger vessel that was operating a 16 -night luxury cruise of 
New Zealand 's South Island  and the UNESCO  World Heritage Site3 sub-Antarctic islands.  With  a 
draught  of five metres (m), it was capable of positioning close inshore, from where its own small , 
rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) were used to get passengers close inshore to observe wildlife 
and scenery.  
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On 7  January 2017  L'Austral sailed  from Lytt elton with 200 passengers and 156 crew on board.   
The navigation officer4 joined the ship in Lyttelton.  It was her first time on the ship  as navigation 
officer . 
3.2.2.  During the  departure  from  Lyttelton the master alter ed the vessel's schedule to call  first at  the 
Snares Islands  due to a favourable weather forecast .

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 3.2.3.  L'Austral arrived  off North East  Island  in the Snares Island s group  at about 0600 on 9 January 
2017 .  Whilst the vessel manoeuvred  close inshore , the passengers  embarked onto the RHIBs 
from the stern platform (referred to on board as the marina  - see Figure 2 ).  The RHIBs then  
cruised around the east coast of the island , allowing the passengers to view the wildlife . 
3.2.4.  The master took control5 of the vessel from the officer of the watch while  the vessel was 
manoeuvring  off North East Island .  
3.2.5.  The passengers returned to the vessel for lunch, whil e the boat crews took the RHIBs  to the south 
of the island to assess  if the weather conditions were  suitable to take the passengers out in the 
afternoon.  
3.2.6.  At approximately  1200  the navigation officer took over the watch  and continued  to assist  the 
master with the navigation .  
3.2.7.  The navigation officer used  the electronic chart display and information system ( ECDIS ) to plan a 
route for repositioning the vessel  south of the island (see Figure 3).  The master  and the 
navigation officer  then took the vessel  from the east side of the  islan d around to the s outh bay .  A 
helmsman  steer ed the ship manually for this short  trip. 
3.2.8.  However, t he weather conditions  were deteriorating , so the  master cancelled the post -lunch 
passenger excursions . L'Austral's  crew  then started  to recover the RHIB s back on board , but due 
to the prevailing weather condition s the recovery took longer than normal.   To obtain the best sea 
conditions for recovering the RHIBs , the master  manoeuvred the ship to maintain a southerly 
heading  whilst  drifting sideways to the west , as shown in Figure 3 .

 3.2.9.  L'Austral eventually drifted into an area marked  on charts  as overfalls , eddies  and breakers6 
south of Alert Stack.  At about 1508 the master and the navigation officer  both heard an  unusual 
sound at the stern , but thought  it was caused by a wave "slamming " under the boarding platform 
at the stern .  The navigation officer  plotted the  ship's position on the paper chart at this time.   
3.2.10.  At about 1510 both the port and the starboard flooding alarms sounded in the engine control 
room , indicating a flood in number 8C void space , which was forward of the engine ro om and 
near the longitudinal centre of the vessel . 
3.2.11.  The engin eering officer of the watch sent  a cadet7 to investigate. The cadet removed the cap from 
the sounding pipe8 for the void space .  Water flowed  out of the sounding pipe, so he re-secure d 
the cap , returned to the engine control room and briefed the engineering officer , who inform ed 
the master  on the bridge. The damage control team mustered on the bridge .  They  monitored the 
tanks and spaces  adjacent to the flooded void space to ensure there was no further flooding .  
3.2.12.  It then became apparent to the crew that the unusual sound they had heard was in fact an 
underwater object that must have pierced the hull . 
3.2.13.  By about 1600 all of the RHIB s had been stowed on the upper deck  and their crews were back on 
board. 
3.2.14.  At about 1630 the damage control team briefed  the master .  They confirmed  that the adjacent 
compartments were dry and that flooding had been contained to just one  void space .  They 
recalculated the stability of the vessel , which confirmed  that the ship's stability  was not adversely 
affected by the flooded void  space .  The master contacted the vessel 's operator , Compagnie du 
Ponant (Ponant ), to report the damage  and it in turn contacted the French authorities. The master 
then  decide d to continue the passage  to Auckland I sland , about 140 nautical miles south of the 
Snares Islands (Figure 4) .

3.2.15.  L'Austral arrived  at Auckland Island  on the morning of 10 January 2017.  Two of the crew 
members used self -contained underwater breathing apparatus to dive under the vessel and take 
photographs of the breach in the hull.  
3.2.16.  The master  was subsequently  briefed on the d amage and updated the report to the operator .  
The operator  then directed  the master to sail L'Austral to Bluff for repairs.  
3.2.17.  On the morning of 11 January 2017 , L'Austral sailed  south to Musgrave I nlet (Figure 4)  so the 
passengers could  cruise the inlet  in RHIBs . The vessel then sailed  for Bluff.  
3.2.18.  L'Austral arrived  in Bluff  (Figure 4)  on the evening of 12 January 2017 , where a  class ification

 3.2.19.  Maritime New Zealan d inspected the vessel and detained it  for the purpose of conducting a  
maritime compliance investigation.   
3.2.20.  On 14 January 2017 Maritime New Zealand release d L'Austral from the detention order s. 
L'Austral sailed from Bluff and continue d the cruise to the sub-Antarctic  islands . 
3.3. Vessel details  
3.3.1.  L'Austral was a passenger vessel built by Fincantieri , Ancona in Italy in 2010.  The registered  
owner was  Ounas SAS  in France  and it was operated by Ponant.  
3.3.2.  L'Austral had a length overall of 142.1 m, a breadth of 18 m and a maximum  draught of 4. 8 m.  It 
was powered by four diesel -electric generators supplying two electric motors , each connected to a 
single fixed -pitch propeller.   It had two high -lift Becker10 rudders  and a single 800-kilowatt  bow-
thrus ter11. 
3.3.3.  L'Austral was fitted with a Class 1 dynamic positioning  system that allowed the vessel to 
automatically  maintain its position and heading  with a high degree of accuracy .  The dynamic 
positioning system was not in use a t the time of the accident.  
3.3.4.  L'Austral was equipped with a long -range , forward -looking sonar, a system for detecting  objects 
under water.   The sonar was not in use at the time of the accident.  
3.4. Environmental conditions  
3.4.1.  The coastal marine forecast  on 9 January 2017 for the area  six nautical miles north of the  Snares 
Islands  was for wind  from the  north -east at 15 knot s rising to  25 knots in the afternoon.  The sea 
state was forecast to become rough with  a 2 m south -west swell.  
3.4.2.  At the time of the acc ident the wind was north -easterly about 20  knots  and the swell was 
reported to be of 2-3 m from the south -west .  The visibility was good. It was two hours before low 
tide at the time of the accident, which  was 0.8 m above  chart datum12.  
3.4.3.  At the time of the accident  there was little predicted tidal stream  that could have contributed to 
the movement of the vessel.  
3.5. Accident damage  
3.5.1.  The accident resulted in a number of penetrations  to the hull , the main one being 600 x 80 
millimetres  in size .  Two keel plate s were  slightly bent .  One frame was distorted i nside the 
penetrated void space . 
3.5.2.  The penetrati on damage was confined to void space  8C (Figure 5) in the vessel 's double -bottom13 
arrangement . There was no pollution  reported .

3.5.3.  Whilst in Bluff , divers conducted temporary repairs to the outside of the hull and sealed the 
damaged internal compartment with cement. They also added baffles14 to the void space to 
reduce its size in the event of re -flooding.  The classification society carried out a  hull occasional 
survey and issued two recommendations  before the vessel sail ed.

January 2016  he had been  the master of Le Soléal , a vessel similar to L'Austral , when it 
conducted a sub-Antarctic  islands  cruise.  
3.6.2.  The navigation  officer held an STCW II/1 certificate  of competency  unlimited for both deck and 
engine room operations .  She  had worked at sea for four years.   In April 2015 , before leaving her 
last vessel,  she had completed type -specific ECDIS training.   The navigation officer had joined 
L'Austral in January 2017 , having been ashore for 20  months .  At the time of the accident  it was 
the navigati on officer's  third bridge watch on L'Austral .

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The operator of L'Austral  had first begun offering its sub-Antarctic  island cruise in 2015.  The 
master had previous operating experience in the area.  The operator  held all of the necessary 
permits required from the Department of Conservation  (see section 4.5) and had up -to-date 
paper and electronic charts for the area .  The predicted and actual weather conditions were 
suitable for conducting passenger RHIB excursions off North East Island .  
4.1.2.  The rock with which  L'Austral made contact was uncharted, having not been detected during a  
hydrographic survey of the islands in 1999 .   
4.1.3.  The following analy sis discusses  the circumstances that led to the vessel making contact with the 
uncharted rock.  Also discussed is one contributing and two non -contributing safety issues : 
 the voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource 
management o n the bridge leading up to the contact  did not meet the  IMO standards  or follow 
the guidelines published in other leading industry publications  
 The operation  of L'Austral's ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance 
or the standards set out in the operator's safety management system.  
 The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to assessing the 
risks to ships and the environment.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  L'Austral's  passengers had  been cruising the east coast of North East Island  in RHIBs  on the 
morning of 9 January.  
4.2.2.  The weather was likely to be too uncomfortable for the passengers in the afternoon , so the RHIBs 
needed to be stowed  back on  board the vessel .  To pick up the RHIBs from the south of the island 
the navigation officer first had to plan a route to the position where the vessel  would meet the 
RHIBs.  This plan consisted of six waypoint s on the ECDIS and three p arallel indexes16 created on 
the radar.  These tools allowed the navigation officer to monitor the vessel 's progress on the 
route and make any corrections needed if the vessel  deviated from the plan.  
4.2.3.  When  L'Austral arrived at the south bay, t he master  began  manoeuvring the vessel  in order to 
facilitate the recovery of the RHIBs  in the shelter provided by the South Promontory of the island 
(see Figure 3).  There were  only two people on the bridge - the master and the navigati on officer.  
Once the master took control of the ship  there was no agreed plan for where the vessel was to be 
or any areas to be avoided . 
4.2.4.  The master had made a mental note to avoid the area of overfalls , eddies and breakers depicted 
on the charts for the area south of Alert Stack.   However , while  the master was  very likely  focused 
on the recovery of the RHIBs , he did not notice that the ship had moved so far to the west , 
entered this area and made contact with the uncharted rock . 
4.2.5.  The operator was not permitted to operate  L'Austral within 300 m of the shoreline under the 
conditions of its coastal permit.  The uncharted rock with which L'Austral made contact was 
closer than 300  m to the shore.  
4.2.6.  Although the rock was un charted, the  description of the waters and the charted depth contours in 
the area were warning enough for operators of ships the size of  L'Austral to give it a wide berth.

<< Page 13 >>
 4.2.7.  The position of the uncharted rock was calculated from the GPS (global positioning syst em) 
posit ion recorded in the ship 's voyage data recorder17. The horizontal accuracy of the GPS was 
recorded as being ±0.9 m. The hull penetration was 52  m behind the GPS antenna. It was very 
likely that the uncharted rock was within the 300  m exclusion zone.  
4.2.8.  The un intentional breach of the coastal permit and the ship entering an area where the master 
had decided not to take it are indicative of a safety issue with the standard of planning and 
bridge resource management.  This is discussed in the following section . 
 
4.3. Voyage planning and c onduct of n avigation   
Safety issue - The voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge 
resource management on the bridge leading up to the contact did not meet the IMO standards  or 
follow the guidelines published in other leading industry publications . 
Bridge resource management  
4.3.1.  To work together effectively on a bridge, it is crucial that the bridge team uses effective  bridge 
resource management (sometimes referred to as non-technical skills).  L eadership and 
communication  are important aspects of bridge resource management .  The bridge team are to 
build a shared understanding of what the plan is and how it is to be implemented.  In that way 
any deviations from the plan ca n be challenged and errors can be detected and remedied without 
an accident occurring . 
4.3.2.  The recovery of the RHIBs so close to the shore would normally be considered 'manoeuvring'.  
The operator's safety management system detail ed the safe manning for the br idge when 
manoeuvring  as "Master and Staff Captain, and one qualified navigational watch keeping rating". 
The safety management system  describe d this as three individuals sharing the workload to 
ensu re safe navigation and lookout.  
4.3.3.  At the time of the accide nt there were  just the master and the navigati on officer  on th e bridge, 
less than the required complement .  Notwithstanding the operator's bridge manning 
requirements, the task could still have been achieved safely had the master and navigation 
officer had  an agreed plan and been  communicating effectively.  
4.3.4.  However, t he bridge audio recording from the voyage data recorder revealed little effective 
communication between the master and the navigation office r while they were on the bridge in 
the 20-minute perio d prior to the grounding .  There was no agreement of a plan and nothing in 
the way of expectations from the master to the navigation officer and nothing in return from  her.

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 4.3.5.  Prior to the grounding the master was focused on three activities :  
 recovering the  RHIBs.  
 communicating  with the staff captain at  the marina . 
 manoeuvring the vessel . 
It is very likely that the master became  focused on  these activities to the detriment of  maintaining  
situational awareness.  
4.3.6.  The navigation officer  was responsible for monit oring the vessel 's progress, ensuring the master's 
actions had the desired effect s, and challenging  the actions of the master if necessary.  Because 
there was no briefing from the master , the navigation officer had no clear understanding of where 
the master planned to position the vessel, so she was unsure of what and when to challenge.  
4.3.7.  During interview s with  the crew there was an indication that bridge team members were reluctant 
to intervene with the actio ns of the master . 
4.3.8.  Such a reluctance to intervene  is contrary to the principle s of good bridge resource management.  
It leaves the ship vulnerable to one -person errors resulting in accidents .  In this case the master 
succumbed to the normal human tendency to become focused on the task at hand  and he lost 
awareness of the bigger picture , specifically  where his ship was in relation to navigational 
hazards.  Situations like this are easily rectified using a team approach , where the team share a 
common plan.  
Radar  
4.3.9.  Figure 7 shows a screengrab18 captured from the  primary radar at the time of the accident. The 
dashed ring labelled 'variable range marker  1' was set at 300  m or 0.162 nautical miles to help 
ensure the vessel did not go within 300 m of the shoreline as defined in the operator's  coastal 
permit.  The master was surprise d to learn that  L'Austral had breached the 300  m limit.  This is 
explainable because the  centre of the 300  m circle is the radar scanner , which is positioned 
above the bridge.  The distance from the radar scanner to the stern is abo ut 90 m.  For the 
variable range marker  to have been  used as a useful monitor to ensure the vessel did not go 
within 300  m of the shoreline, it would  have been appropriate to set it to at least 390  m. 
4.3.10.  The radar was set to a 1.5 -nautical -mile range  scale .  Given the close proximity of the island , a 
smaller range scale such as 0.75 nautical miles would have better aided position monitoring.  
4.3.11.  While the radar gave an indication of the ship's distance from  the shoreline, it alone was not a 
definitive tool for continuously mo nitoring where the ship lay in relation to navigation al hazards 
not detectable by radar.  A more appropriate tool for position  monitoring would have been the 
ECDIS and the paper ch art.  The use of these is discussed below.

Position monitoring on paper charts  
4.3.12.  The area where  L'Austral struck the submerged ro ck was surveyed in 1999 to a ±50  m positional 
accuracy and a ±1.6  m depth accuracy.   Within these parameters it  was possible that a rock 
pinnacle would  not have been  captured.   The information captured during this survey was used to 
produce the paper chart NZ  2411 . 
4.3.13.  The vessel 's primary means of navigation was the ECDIS , comprising a  primary unit and a back -
up planning unit .  The operator 's safety management system referred to  French law  requiring  
L'Austral to have a paper  chart  back -up in addition to the secondary ECDIS unit.  However, the 
operator had misinterpreted the legislation .  Article 221 -V/19 in French law state d that back -up 
devices for ECDIS s could  be paper or electron ic.  This was not a safety issue as such, as the ship 
had more than the minimum requirement, that  being a primary and a secondary ECDIS, and a 
folio of paper charts .  All three systems were up to date.  
4.3.14.  The use of either the ECDIS or the paper chart systems was acceptable, provided that the method 
was compatible with the situation.  There were issues with the way in which the ECDIS was being 
used on board, which are discussed in the following section.  However, there were  also issues 
with the way in which the paper charts were used.  
4.3.15.  Figure 8 shows two position fixes on the paper chart that was in use at the time of the accident. 
The operator 's safety management system  state d that  the officer o f the watch shall "plot the 
ship's position on t he appropriate chart and check at sufficiently frequent intervals dependi ng on 
the prevailing conditions ".

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 4.3.16.  The vessel was manoeuvring very close to land, which  was a high -risk activity  requiring precise 
navigation techniques to monitor the vessel 's posit ion.  Approximately 30 minutes passed 
between  the time the vessel arrived at the south bay and the time the vessel struck the rock. 
Position 2 was added after the navigation officer  heard the sound of the impact.  P rior to this 
there was only one  position marked on the chart.  
4.3.17.  An activity requiring constant manoeuvring of a ship close to a shoreline would normally be 
subjected to almost constant monitoring of the ship's position .  This can be achieved with a 
combination of monitoring by radar, backed up by frequent fixing of the ship's position on a paper 
chart.  Apart from the position  fix at 1431 (see Figure 8) , the radar was only being used to 
monitor the  ship's  distance off the  shoreline to ensure there was no breach of the coastal permit 
restrictions, rather than to monitor the ship's position in relation to navigational hazards.  
4.3.18.  An ECDIS is ideally suited to constantly monitoring a ship's position, provided it is properly 
configured  and utilised .

 4.4. Electronic chart display and information system  (ECDIS)  
Safety issue - The operation of  L'Austral's  ECDIS  did not meet good practice as defined in the 
IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator's safety management system . 
Chart accuracy  
4.4.1.  The existence of uncharted dangers to navigation is a foreseeable risk for mariners.  Paper chart s 
are printed with 'source diagram s' that show the degree of accuracy  of, or the level of confidence 
that a mariner can have in , that chart.  ECDIS charts display  Category Zone of Confidence  
(CATZOC)19 symbols, which give visual repre sentation s of the accuracy  of underlying data . A table 
detailing the different CAT ZOC values can be found in Appendix 1.   
4.4.2.  SOLAS20 chapter V , regulation 2.2 describes  an electronic navigation chart (ENC) or paper chart  
as one : "issued officially by or on the  authority of a Government, authorized Hydrographic Office 
or other relevant government institution and is designed to meet the requirements of marine 
navigation". The operator had a responsibility to ensure that all charts and ENC s delivered to the 
vessel  were  official nautical publications.   
4.4.3.  Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is the recogni sed hydrographic office of New Zealand.  It 
produces the paper chart NZ 2411 and the raster  navigational chart21 NZ 241102 .  LINZ had not 
created  an ENC for the area of the Snares Islands  at the time of the accident . 
4.4.4.  The ECDIS on  board  L'Austral was loaded with an unofficial ENC for the Snares Islands, which 
had been  produced by C-MAP, a Norwegian company.   The C-MAP ENC was derived from 
published electronic raster navigational charts where the local hydrographic office s had not 
produced ENC s.  The ENC that was in use at the ti me of the accident is shown in F igure 9.  The 
CATZOC U symbols denote that the "the quality of the bathymetric  data has yet to be assessed"22.  
This low-confidence marker was also used as an indicator that it had not been  produced by the 
local national hydrographic office, in this case L INZ.   
4.4.5.  The paper chart had a scale  of 1:25 ,000, and in the area of the accident the underlying survey 
informati on was assessed as having a CATZOC of B ; however,  the ENC loaded in the ECDIS  at the 
time of the accident  had a CATZOC of U . This discrepancy was due to the CATZOC value denoting 
that the ENC had been produced by an unofficial source.

4.4.6.  There is a requirement for shore -based personnel who have a responsibility to outfit ships with 
ECDIS ENCs to have undergone the IMO generic ECDIS training , to ensure they are familiar with 
the IMO requirements.  The provision of the  C-MAP  chart portfolio  containing unofficial ENCs  for 
loading into L'Austral's  ECDIS should have been accompanied by an alert , warning that some of 
the charts had not been produced by official hydrographic source s. 
4.4.7.  The bridge team on  L'Austral did not appreciate that the CATZOC of U shown on their ECDIS at the 
time of the accident indicated that it had been  produced by C -MAP, not by LINZ .   
4.4.8.  The master and deck officers  of L'Austral had all received  IMO mandatory generic ECDIS training , 
and addition ally they had completed type -specific training  for the Sperry VisionMaster FT as fitted 
to the L'Austral .  The IMO requires this training to be supplied  by the ECDIS manufacturer, or its 
designated providers.  However , the navigation officer  had received this training in -house from  a 
captain who had undergone the manufacturer 's training .  This training may or may not have been 
adequate.  It met the French  flag requirement for type -specific  training ; however , it did not comply 
with the IMO standard23.   
4.4.9.  The navigation officer had completed the type -specific training in April 2015, just prior to 
spending 20 months ashore. The  International Safety Management ( ISM) Code  includes a 
requirement for operators to ensure that shipboard crew are thoroughly familiar with the systems 
and equipment with which they are working.  T here had been  a strong case for the ship operator 
to arrange refresher training for the navig ation officer before she joined L'Austral to ensure full 
familiarity with the ECDIS.  There is no expiry date for type-specific training ; however , considering 
the complexity of  the ECDIS and that this officer had  had little opportunity to utilise what she had 
learnt,  it is likely that she would have benefited from some refresher  training.  
4.4.10.  The Sperry Vision Master FT ECDIS allows the user to set safety parameters and configure  when a 
warning alarm  will be activated .  On L'Austral the master had stipulated that permanent ECDIS 
safety parameter s were to be used ( see F igure 12).  By defining the safety parameters the bridge

 team were unable to change the way that the ECDIS displayed or alarmed and were therefore 
constrained by the information and warnings it provid ed them.    
4.4.11.  When a vessel is operating offshore , the look -head time is usually  increased in recognition  that 
the ship is navigating at a lower level of risk and to give the bridge team longer to react to any 
hazards.  However, w hilst in coastal areas i t is normal  to change the look -ahead to a shorter time 
period in recognition that the navigati on officers are operating at a heightened level of vigilance 
and to reduce the number of 'nuisance' alarms.   Similarly, when  operating close to navigation al 
hazards the  look-ahead and shallow contour depth  should be set relative  to the topography of the 
seabed to visualise change s in depths  and reduce the number of 'nuisance' alarms . 
4.4.12.  Alarms  are configured by using a number of parameters , which  are explained i n Figures 10 and 
11. They  are triggered when a 'virtual region ' defined by  time, distance or depth  around a ship is 
predicted  to cross a charted danger.

are usually in 10 m  increments , setting the shallow contour at 6  m would have rounded up to 10  
m on the ENC in use at the time of the accident.   With this configuration  the shallow contour did 
not show,  as it was effectively the  same as the s afety depth.  The shallow contour could have

4.4.14.  The operator's  safety management system  required  that the  ECDIS  safety  parameters , or the 
"antigrounding  [sic] settings" , be ad apted to the type of navigation: offshore, coastal  or port 
approach .  However , the prescribing of permanent safety  parameters indicate d that there was no t 
a clear understanding of how the parameters could best be used to improve safety in different 
navigation al situations . 
4.4.15.  Prior to the accident the ECDIS did not alarm  because : 
 the rock that the vessel struck was not charted  
 the shallow contour was set at 6  m 
 there was no user -defined prohibited area.  
A warning could have been configured to alarm and alert the bridge team that the vessel was 
entering a potentially dangerous area.   
4.4.16.  If the shallow contour  parameter had been set to 30  m, the ECDIS would have displayed a 
warning  or alarmed  when the vessel  was predicted to cross the 30 m contour.  
4.4.17.  There were no prohibited areas defined in the  ECDIS  to the south of North East Island .  User -
defined prohibited areas are areas where the navigation officer does not wish the vessel to enter , 
similar to a no -go zone24 on a paper chart .  The master said that he did not want the vessel to 
enter the area indicated in Figure 13 as the chart showed  the 'overfalls, eddies and breakers ' 
symbol.  Had this area been  identified as a no -go area , the ECDIS would have  alarmed as the 
vessel manoeuvred , affording the  bridge team time to  take avoiding action.

4.4.18.  In summary, the ECDIS would have been an ideal aid to navigation when manoeuvring close to 
the Snares Islands.  It could have been used to monitor the ship's position  continuously  in 
relation to chosen parameters , could have warned the bridge team that the ship was not where 
they wanted it to be , and draw n the master's attention away from the task of recovering the 
RIHBs to the more immediate concern - preventing the ship grounding.  
4.4.19.  Although the ECDIS was designated as the ship's primary navigation system, it was not being 
used as such and not being used to its full potential.  It is likely that this was in part due to the 
concept of ECDIS not being fully understood by both the operator and the bridge team on the day.

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 4.5. Department of Conservation permits  
Safety issue - The Department of Conservation had insufficient maritime expertise applied to 
assessing the risk s to ships and the environment.   
To operate the sub-Antarctic  cruise , that the operator offered, it had to obtain three  types of 
permit from the Department of Conservation : 
 
Permit Name  Permit Purpose  Valid for  
Concession to operate 
in the sub-Antarctic  
islands  Allowed the operator  to conduct guided 
walks up to two times a year at approved 
sites, subject to the terms of the entry 
permit  6 years 3 months  
Coastal permit  Allowed L'Austral access to the coastal 
marine area of the sub-Antarctic  islands  by 
a vessel longer  than 125  m, up to 300  m 
from the shore  5 years 9 months  
Entry permit to 
Campbell and Auckland 
Island nature reserves  Allowed L'Austral to land passengers on 
these islands for guided walks within the 
nature reserves  1 year 3 months  
Table 1 
Detai ls of Department of Conservation permits  
4.5.1.  In January 2016  L'Austral had been  granted a coastal permit that prevented  it navigating within  
600 m of the mean high water springs mark (the shoreline) of any sub-Antarctic  island.  The 600 
m limit did not allow the vessel to enter harbours  at the Auckland and Campbell Islands . As a 
result  passengers  had to be transferred from outside the harbour  limits  to the landing sites by 
RHIBs. The Proposed Regional Coastal Plan for the sub-Antarctic  islands  included the table shown 
in Figure 14 . 
 
Figure 14  
Extract from Proposed Regional Coastal Plan: Kermadec and sub-Antarctic  islands , Snares Islands   
(at the time of the accident)  
 
4.5.2.  The ship operator had become  concerned about the safety of trans ferring passengers to  and from 
landing sites in RHIBs  in what was sometimes rough water , so in 2016 the company applied for a 
new coastal permit , requesting  that the vessel be allowed to navigate up to 300  m from the 
shoreline.  This would allow the ship to enter the harbours, thereby reduc ing passenger's 
exposure to rough water . 
4.5.3.  As the relevant rules in the Proposed Regional Coastal Plan had not come into force , the operator 
could  apply for a discretionary permit allowing the ship to navigate up to 300  m from the 
shoreline . This would have been prohibited if the coastal plan had been in force .  Section 
87B(1)(c) of the Resource Management Act  1991  states that if a rule is not in operation , the 
activity  "it is to be treated as discretionary ". This mean t that the operator could  apply for a coastal 
permit for any of the pro hibited areas listed in Figure 14. 

 
Final Report MO -2017 -201 
<< Page 23 >>
 4.5.4.  At the time the Department of Conservation  received the  application  from the operator for a new 
discre tionary coastal permit,  it had no internal  maritime  expertise to assess the  additional  risks to 
ships and the environment in allowing the ship to navigate up to 300  m from the  shoreline. The 
Department of Conservation  had an informal agreement with a marit ime professional who 
advised it that,  "considering the capabilities of this modern vessel it is unlikely that this activity 
poses a significant risk of a grounding incident ".  This person  was contacted on an informal basis 
and was not employed by the Department of Conservation .  No formal risk assessment  process 
was conducted . 
4.5.5.  The Minister of Conservation (through the Department of Conservation ) has some of  the 
responsibilities, duties and powers that a regional council has under the Resource Managemen t 
Act, in respect of the sub-Antarctic  islands25. 
4.5.6.  When a regional council is responsible for a port or harbour it usually appoint s a harbour master 
who is responsible for enforcing regulations  and ensuring , safe navigation and security.  Given 
the potential ly harsh and sensitive environment in the region, and the likelihood that shipping 
activity will increase in future, the Commission recommends  that the Department of Conservation  
appoint a suitably qualified person to manage the safety of navigation in the sub-Antarctic  
islands .

9. The Department of Conservation  granted a coastal permit allowing  L'Austral  to 
navigate up to 300  metres from the shoreline  in all of the sub-Antarc tic islands , 
without conducting a formal risk assessment using the appropriate maritime 
expertise to ensure that the necessary risk controls were in place.

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 5. Findings  
5.1. L'Austral inadvertently entered a 300 -metre exclusion zone , which  the ship was not authorised to 
enter and in which the chart s noted the existence of overfalls , eddies and breakers . 
5.2. L'Austral made contact with an uncharted rock inside the 300 -metre exclusion zone . 
5.3. The uncharted rock was in an area the Commission considers would not be su itable for the safe 
navigation of ships the size of  L'Austral  without having a high level of confidence in the accuracy 
of available hydrographic information . 
5.4. The portion of the voyage plan  that related to recover ing the ship's rigid-hulled inflatable boat s 
was not well planned in accordance with the International Maritime Organization  standards and 
the guidelines given in leading industry publications . 
5.5. L'Austral inadvertently entered an unauthorised zone and an area the master had intended to 
avoid because  the ship's position was not being adequately monitored . 
5.6. The standard of bridge resource management on board  L'Austral did not meet good industry 
practice . 
5.7. The operator's system for providing and managing the provision of the electronic chart display and 
information system  on board L'Austral did not meet the intent of the International Maritime 
Organi zation standards . 
5.8. The electronic chart display and information system  was the primary means of navigation on 
board  L'Austral , yet the operating crew were not fully familiar with the capabilities and the 
limitations of the equipment, and were not making best use of it  
5.9. The Department of Conservation granted a coastal permit allowing  L'Austral to navigate up to 300

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified by 
the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwis e result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation; and  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety iss ues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. None identified.  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3. A notice to mariners has been published by Land Information New Zealand alerting mariners to 
the existence of an obstruction  off Alert Stack , until a full survey can be conducted . 
The presumed location of the obstruction  off Alert Stack has been added to all paper and 
electronic  charts.  
Land Information New Zealand have published two official ENCs that cover the Snares Islands 
(NZ 424111 and NZ  502411).

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are a pplicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Department of Conservation and 
the operator .   
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendations  
To the Department of Conservation  
8.3. The Minister of Conservation (through the Department of Cons ervation ) has some of  the 
responsibilities, duties and powers that a regional council has under the Resource Management 
Act 1991  in respect of the sub-Antarctic  islands.  When a regional council is responsible for a port 
or harbour it usually appoint s a harbour master who is responsible for enforcing regulations and 
ensuring safe navigation and security.  
The Department of Conservation granted a coastal permit allowing  L'Austral to navigate up to  
300 m o ff the shoreline in all of the sub-Antarctic  islands , without conducting a formal risk 
assessment using the appropriate maritime expertise to ensure  that the necessary risk controls 
were in place.  
On 23 February 2018  the Commission recommended that, given the potentially harsh and 
sensitive environment in the sub-Antarctic  islands and the likelihood that shipping activity will 
increase in future , the Director -General  of the Department of Conservation appoint a suitably 
qualified person to manage the safety of navigation in the sub-Antarctic  islands. (001/18 )  
8.3.1.  On 9 March 2018, Department of Conservation replied:  
I can confirm that the Director -General will implement the recommendation of the 
Commission . 
In order to implement the recommendation, the Department  of Conservation intends to 
enter into a contractual  arrangement with a suitably qualified person to manage  the 
safety of navigation in the Subantarctic Islands. The  intention is that this person will 
carry out the  functions and services of a harbourmaster as are relevant  to the 
Subantarctic (and Kermadec ) Islands, albeit that  the appointment will not be made 
pursuant to the Maritime  Transport Act 1994 . 
The Department intends to take the following actions in the first instance:  
a. Obtain advice from Ma ritime New Zealand as to what qualifications and experience 
are necessary for a  "suitably qualified person" to deliver harbourmaster  functions 
for the Subantarctic (and Kermadec)  Islands. Advice will also be sought on which  
harbourmaster functions are relevant to the  Subantarctic (and Kermedec) Island s. 
b. Request the s ame advice from Environment Canterbury Harbourmaster, an 
experienced harbourmaster, has provided the Department with expert maritime 
advice in the development of the regional coastal plan and during the appeal 
process.  He is also personally familiar with both groups of islands . 
Depending on the advice we recei ve, options the  Department will assess are likely to 
include asking Mr  Dilley if he would consider a contractual arrangement to  provide the 
harbourmaster functions, or, alternatively,  whether two separate arrangements with 
harbourmasters in  Whangarei and S outhland would be more effective . 
I am not in a position at this stage (i.e. prior to receiving the advice outlined above) to 
advise when we  anticipate this will be fully implemented.

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 To the operator  
8.4. Taking into consideration that:  
 the portion of the voy age plan that related to recover ing the ship's RHIB s was not well planned 
in accordance with the IMO standards and the guidelines given in leading industry 
publications, and  
 L'Austral inadvertently encroached an exclusion zone and an area the master had in tended to 
avoid because the ship's position was not being adequately monitored, and  
 the standard of bridge resource management on board L'Austral did not meet good industry 
practice.  
On 23 February 2018  the Commission recommended that  the Directeur D'exploitation at Ponant 
review the safety management system  on board  L'Austral and upgrade it to ensure that the 
standards of voyage planning, the standards of navigation and the level of bridge resource 
management met the requirements of the International  Maritime Organisation  and follow ed the 
guidelines in leading industry publications.  (002/18)  
8.4.1.  On 15 March 2018, Ponant replied, in part:  
Ponant's Voyage Planning procedure was reviewed on 15 December 2017.  This new 
procedure has been communicated to all C aptains.  
Specific BRM training sessions provided by the French Marine Academy have been 
rolled out, starting from January 2017.  To date 21 Ponant officers have undergone the 
training, 13 more are scheduled to undergo this training in 2018.  
8.5. Taking into con sideration that:  
 the operator's system for providing and managing the provision of  the ECDIS on board 
L'Austral did not meet the intent of the International Maritime Organisation standards , and  
 the ECDIS was the primary means of navigation on board  L'Austr al, yet the operating crew 
were not fully familiar with the capabilities and the limitations of the equipment, and were not 
making best use of it . 
On 23 February 2018  the Commission recommended that the Directeur D'exploitation at Ponant 
review  the procedures for the setting up, training in and ongoing support for ECDIS systems on all 
of its ships, and ensure that all comply with mandatory requirements and that the ships ' crews 
are fully conversant with good industry practice for the use of ECDIS.  (003/18 ) 
8.5.1.  On 15 March 2018, Ponant  replied, in part:  
Ponant has also started obtaining additional ECDIS training session program for its 
officers.  Eleven officers received this training in 2016 and 2017 and we plan to train 15 
more during 2018.  
We also plan to develop a specific Ponant's ECDIS training with e -learning methods, we 
are in the process of researching the best way of doing this.  We intend to complete this 
by the end of 2018.  We will provide TAIC with an update once we have completed this 
interna l training program.

 9. Key l essons  
9.1. ECDIS is a valuable aid to navigation.  However, mariners need to understand  fully and be familiar 
with all aspects of the system, otherwise relying on the ECDIS as a primary means of navigation 
can contribute to, rather than prevent , accidents .  
9.2. Every part of a ship 's voyage must be planned , and all members of the bridge team be fully 
familiar with and agree to the plan. This is a cornerstone of good bridge resource management.  
9.3. Good bridge resource management relies on a culture where challenge is welcomed and 
responded to, regardless of rank, personality or nationality .

ECDIS - GUIDANCE FOR GOOD PRACTICE  
The Maritime Safety Committee, at its ninety -fifth session (3 to 12 June 2015), approved the ECDIS - 
Guidance for Good Practice, as set out in the annex, drawing together relevant guidance from seven previous 
ECDIS circul ars into a single, consolidated  document.  
The undeniable safety benefits of navigating with Electronic Chart Display and Information  Systems  
(ECDIS)  were  recognized  through  Formal  Safety  Assessments  submitted to the Organization and 
experience gained by the voluntary use of ECDIS for many years. ECDIS was mandated for carriage by 
High -Speed Craft (HSC) as early as 1 July 2008. Subsequently, the mandatory carriage of ECDIS for 
ships other than HSC (depending on the ship  type,  size and construction  date,  as required  by SOLAS  
regulation  V/19.2.10)  commenced in a phased manner from 1 July 2012  onwards.  
ECDIS  is a complex,  safety -relevant,  software -based  system  with multiple  options  for display and 
integration. The ongoing safe and effective use of ECDIS involves many stakeholders including 
seafarers, equipment manufacturers, chart producers, hardware and software maintenance providers, 
shipowners and operators, and training providers. It is important that all these stakeholders have a 
clear and common und erstanding of their roles and responsibilities in relation to  ECDIS.  
ECDIS was accepted as meeting the chart carriage requirements of SOLAS regulation  V/19  in 2002.  
Over  the years,  IMO Member  States,  hydrographic  offices,  equipment manufacturers and other 
organizations have contributed to the development of guidance on a variety of ECDIS -related matters. 
Over the years, IMO has issued a series of complementary circulars on  ECDIS.  
While most useful IMO guidance on ECDIS was developed in this incremental manner, the information 
needed to be consolidated, where possible, to have ECDIS -related guidance within a single circular, 
which could be easily kept up to date without duplication or need for continual cross -referencing. Suc h 
consolidation of information offers clear and unambiguous understanding of the carriage 
requirements and use of  ECDIS.  
The consolidated guidance termed " ECDIS - Guidance for Good Practice " is set out in  the annex  to this 
circular  (referred  to as "Guidance"  hereafter).  Ship operators,  masters  and deck officers on ECDIS -
fitted ships are encouraged to use this guidance to improve their understanding and facilitate safe 
and effective use of ECDIS.

INTRODUCTION  
The undeniable safety benefits of navigating with Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems 
(ECDIS) were recognized through Formal Safety Assessments submitted  to the Organization  and 
experience  gained  by the voluntary  use of ECDIS  for many years.  ECDIS  was mandated  for carriage  by 
High -Speed  Craft  (HSC)  as early  as 1 July 2008. Subsequently, the mandatory carriage of ECDIS for 
ships other than HSC (depending on the ship type, size and construction date, as required by SOLAS 
regulation V/19.2.10) commenced in a phased manner from 1 July 2012  onwards.  
ECDIS is a complex, safety -relevant, software -based system with multiple options for display and 
integration. The ongoing safe and effective use of ECDIS involves many stakeholders including 
seafarers,  equipment manufacturers, chart producers, hardware and software maintenance providers, 
shipowners and operators, and training providers. It is important that all these stakeholders have a 
clear and common understanding of their roles and responsibilities in relation to  ECDIS.  
This ECDIS - Guidance for Good Practice , referred to as "Guidance" hereafter, draws together relevant 
guidance from seven previous ECDIS circulars into a single, consolidated  document.  
It has been laid out in seven sections, namely:  
Chart carriage requirement of  SOLAS  
Maintenance of ECDIS  software  
Operating anomalies identified within  ECDIS  
Differences between raster chart display system (RCDS) and  ECDIS  
ECDIS  training  
Transitioning from paper chart to ECDIS  navigation  
Guidance on training and assessment in the operational use of ECDIS simulators  
This guidance is intended to assist smooth implementation of ECDIS and its ongoing safe and effective use 
on board ships. Ship operators, masters and deck officers on ECDIS -fitted ships are  encouraged to use this 
guidance  to improve their understanding and facilitate safe and effective use of ECDIS.  
Although this guidance replaces seven IMO ECDIS -related circulars, there remain several  other  IMO 
circulars  that also address  ECDIS  matters  to varying  degree  and reference should also be made to 
these circulars where necessary. A list containing the IMO ECDIS performance  standards,  the seven  
IMO ECDIS -related  circulars  that have  been  replaced  and the other IMO circulars that relate to ECDIS is 
provided in the reference  section.

 The mandatory carriage of ECDIS, as required by SOLAS regulation V/19.2.10, is subject to a staged 
entry into force between 1 July 2012 and 1 July 2018. As per SOLAS regulations V/18 an d V/19, for a 
ship to use ECDIS to meet the chart carriage requirements of SOLAS, the ECDIS equipment must 
conform to the relevant IMO performance standards. ECDIS units on board are required to comply with 
one of two performance standards (either IMO resolution  A.817(19),  as amended  or resolution  
MSC.232(82)),  depending  on the date  of their installation. Essentially, where an ECDIS is being used to 
meet the chart carriage requirements of SOLAS, it must:  
be type-approved;  
use up to date electronic nautical charts  (ENC);  
be maintained so as to be compatible with the latest applicable International Hydrographic 
Organization (IHO) standards;  and 
have adequate, independent back -up arrangements in  place.  
According to SOLAS regulation V/18, ECDIS units on board sh ips must be type -approved. Type 
approval is the certification process that ECDIS equipment must undergo before it can be considered 
as complying with IMO performance standards. The process  is carried  out by flag Administration -
accredited  type-approval  organizations  or marine classification  societies  in accordance  with the 
relevant  test standards  developed  by, inter  alia, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) (e.g. 
IEC 61174).  
In accordance  with SOLAS  regulation  V/19.2.1.4,  ships  must  carry  all nautical  charts necessary for the 
intended voyage. As defined by SOLAS regulation V/2.2, nautical charts are issued officially by or on 
the authority of a Government, authorized Hydrographic Office or other relevant government 
institutions. Ships requ ired to fit ECDIS and ships choosing to use ECDIS to meet the chart carriage 
requirements of SOLAS should carry Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) or, where ENCs are not 
available at all or are not of an appropriate scale for the planning and display of  the ship's voyage 
plan, Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) and/or any needed paper charts should be  carried.  
IHO provides an online chart catalogue that details the coverage of ENCs together with references to 
coastal State guidance on any requirements for paper charts (where this has  been  provided).  The 
catalogue  also provides  links  to IHO Member  States'  websites  where additional information may be 
found. The IHO online chart catalogue can be accessed from the IHO website at:  www.iho.int.  
As per SOLAS  regulation  V/27,  all nautical  charts  necessary  for the intended  voyage shall be adequate 
and up to date. For ships using ECDIS to meet the chart carriage requirement  of SOLAS,  all ENCs  and 
RNCs  must  be of the latest  available  edition  and be kept up  to date  using  both  the electronic  chart  
updates  (e.g. ENC updates)  and the latest  available notices to mariners. Additionally, ECDIS software 
should be kept up to date such that it is capable of displaying up -to-date electronic charts correctly 
according to the latest version of IHO's chart content and display  standards.  
Relevant appendices of IMO performance standards for ECDIS specify the requirements for adequate 
independent back -up arrangement s to ensure safe navigation in case of ECDIS failure. Such 
arrangements include: 1) facilities enabling a safe take -over of the ECDIS functions in order to ensure 
that an ECDIS failure does not result in a critical situation; 2) a means to provide for safe  navigation 
for the remaining part of the voyage in case of ECDIS  failure.  
MAINTENANCE OF ECDIS  SOFTWARE  
ECDIS in operation comprises hardware, software and data. It is important for the safety  of navigation  
that the application  software  within  the ECDIS  works  fully in accordance  with the Performance Standards 
and is capable of displaying all the relevant digital information contained within the  ENC.  
ECDIS that is not updated to the latest version of the IHO Standards may not meet the  chart  carriage  
requirements  as set out in SOLAS  regulation  V/19.2.1.4.

 Final Report MO -2017 -201 For example,  in January  2007,  Supplement  No.1  to the IHO ENC Product  Specification was introduced in 
order to include, within the ENC, the then recently introduced IMO requirements  for Particularly  
Sensitive  Sea Areas  (PSSA),  Archipelagic  Sea Lanes  (ASL)  and to cater  for any future  safety  of navigation  
requirements.  
Any ECDIS which is not upgraded to be compatible with the latest version of the IHO  ENC Product  
Specification  or the Presentation  Library  may be unable  to correctly  display the latest charted features. 
Additionally, the appropriate alarms and indications may not be activated  even  though  the features  
have  been  included  in the ENC.  Similarly,  any ECDIS  which is  not updated  to be fully compliant  with the 
latest  version  of the IHO Data  Protection  Standard may  fail to decrypt  or to properly  authenticate  some  
ENCs,  leading  to failure  to load or install. An up -to-date list of all the relevant IHO standards relating to 
ECDIS equipment can be accessed  from  the IHO website  (www.iho.int).  
The need  for safe navigation  requires  that manufacturers  should  provide  a mechanism to ensure  software  
maintenance  arrangements  are adequate.  This may be achieved  through  the provision  of software  version  
information  using  a website.  Such  information  should  include  the IHO  Standards  which  have  been  
implemented.  
Administrations  should  inform  shipowners  and operators  that proper  ECDIS  software maintenance is an 
important issue and that adequate measures need to be implemented by masters,  shipowners  and 
operators  in accordance  with the International  Safety  Management (ISM)  Code.  
ECDIS  TRAINING  
The information provided below aims to assist Member Governments, Parties to the STCW  Convention,  
companies  and seafarers  in ensuring  that training  programmes  on the use of ECDIS provided to 
masters and deck officers1 serving on ships fitted with ECDIS meet the mandatory training 
requirements of the STCW  Convention:  
under the provisions of the STCW Convention and Code, all officers in charge of a navigational watch 
on ships of 500 gross tonnage or more must have a thorough knowledge and ability to use nautical 
charts and nautical publications (refer STCW Code Table  A-II/1);  
masters  and officers  in charge  of a navig ational  watch  (both  at management and operational level) 
serving on ships fitted with ECDIS should as a minimum, undertake appropriate generic ECDIS 
training, meeting the competence requirements of the 2010 Manila Amendments to the STCW 
Convention and  Code;  
the 2010 Manila Amendments to the STCW Convention and Code have reinforced ECDIS training 
requirements and introduced several additional specific competencies in the use of ECDIS for officers 
both at management and operational level serving on ECDIS -fitted ships  (refer to STCW Code Tables A -
II/1 and A -II/2). Training in accordance with the 2010 Manila Amendments became effective from 1 
July 2013;  
masters and officers certificated under chapter II of the STCW Convention serving  on board  ships  fitted  
with ECDIS  are to be familiarized  (in accordance with STCW regulation I/14) with the ship's equipment 
including  ECDIS;  
STCW  Convention  regulation  I/14,  paragraph  1.5, as well as sections  6.3 and 
6.5 of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, require companies to ensure seafarers are 
provided with familiarization training. A ship safety management system should include familiarization with 
the ECDIS equipment fitted, including its backup arrangements, sensors and related peripherals. ECDIS 
manufacturer s are encouraged to provide training resources including type -specific materials. These 
resources may form part of the ECDIS familiarization training;  
STCW Convention regulation I/14, paragraph 1.4, requires companies to maintain evidence of the 
training a nd ensures that it is readily accessible. For certificates of competency that have expiry dates 
beyond 1 January 2017, port State control authorities should accept the certificate issued as prima

 facie evidence that the seafarer has met the standard of competence required  by the 2010  
Amendments  in accordance  with the control  provisions of article X and regulation I/4 of the STCW  
Convention;  
Companies  should also maintain evidence of the familiarization training in compliance with STCW 
Convention regulati on I/14, paragraph  1.5; 
Administrations should inform their port State control officers of the requirements for ECDIS training 
as detailed in paragraph 7 above;  and 
attention is also dra wn to STCW.7/Circ.16 - Clarification of transitional provisions  relating  to the 2010  
Manila  Amendments  to the STCW  Convention and Code and STCW.7/Circ.17 - Advice for port State 
control officers on transitional arrangements leading up to the full implementation of the requirements  
of the 2010  Manila  Amendments  to the STCW  Convention  and Code on 1 January 2017.
