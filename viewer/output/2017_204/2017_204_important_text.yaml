  \  A large cruise vessel such as the Seabourn Encore  breaking away from its berth\
  \ could have \nhad serious  consequences.  Although the ship could have been better\
  \ prepared for the \nweather event had  the message from the pilot reached the master,\
  \ once the weather event \noccurred,  the prompt  reaction  by the ship's crew \
  \ reduced the risk of harm to people  and \ndamage to  property and the environment.\
  \  Nevertheless , the Milburn Carrier II , the Seabourn \nEncor e and Number One\
  \ and Number Two Wharves still suffered damage , and there was a \nrisk of injury\
  \ to passengers and other personnel who could easily have been occupying the \n\
  wharf at the time . \n4.1.2.  A similar event had occurred at the port in February\
  \ 2015.  The port's own investigation report \non that accident  had made several\
  \ important recommendations that required addressing by \nthe port  company .  This\
  \ latest accident  identified some similarities between the two events \nand show\
  \ ed that further progress is still re quired to ensure that large vessels , including\
  \ cruise \nvessels , can remain safely alongside in adverse weather conditions.\
  \  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses  why the Seabourn Encore  broke away\
  \ from its berth , and \ndiscusses two safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 the safe working\
  \ loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown and \ntherefore it was\
  \ not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the mooring procedures contained in the port's SMS  were not strictly adhered\
  \ to and the \nproced ure in the event of a high wind warning was ineffective. \
  \ \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The Seabourn Encore  was secured to Number One\
  \ W harf using  six head  lines, six stern lines  \nand two forward and two aft\
  \ springs .  This exceeded the standard securing arrangement by \nusing  an additional\
  \  two head  lines and two additional stern lines. The decision was based on \n\
  information in the weather forecast  and an expectation that the wind speed would\
  \ be no more \nthan 2 0 knots from the south later that afternoon.   \n4.2.2.  All\
  \ the mooring ropes were in good condition ; they followed good leads  from the\
  \ winches  and \npassed  through well maintained panama and roller fairleads . \
  \  \n4.2.3.  At the time of the accident  the tide was rising.  CCTV footage showed\
  \ that a ll the stern lines \nleading from wi nches were fairly equally tension\
  \ ed with a small amount of slack  on two lines \nthat were turned up on sets of\
  \ mooring bi tts.  \n4.2.4.  When the  wind changed toward s the south , the relative\
  \ wind direction19 was about  135\xB0  and \npushing on  to the vessel 's starboard\
  \ quarter .  As the wind speed increased , the effect s were  \nthat the vessel\
  \ tried to move bodily forward and the stern  tried  to move off the berth.  A \n\
  warehouse on the wharf was affording the forward half of the vessel some protection\
  \ from the \nwind.   \n4.2.5.  The weig ht on the forward springs and stern lines\
  \ increased significantly , with a consequent \nincrease in the load being applied\
  \ to the corresponding shore bollards .  When the wind speed \ngusted to 45 knots,\
  \ bollards 86  and 87, each holding a forward spring, and bollard 26 holding \n\
  two stern lines  all failed20 within about 28 seconds . \n4.2.6.  This meant that\
  \ f our of the eight mooring ropes that were providing the majority of the holding\
  \ \npower were  rendered ineffective  and the remaining mooring ropes and shore\
  \ bollards were \nnow required to take significantly more load.   \n           \
  \                                             \n19 The wind direction relative to\
  \ the ship's head measured clockwise from 000\xB0 through 180\xB0 at the stern,\
  \ \nreturning to 360\xB0 at the ship's head.  \n20 The point at which the bollards\
  \ could be considered unfit for purpose.  \nFinal Re port MO -2017 -204 \n<< Page\
  \ 17 >>\n 4.2.7.  As the load on the remaining mooring lines increased , the stern\
  \  started to move further off the \nberth .  The bridge team had already observed\
  \ events on the wharf and progressively ordered \npower for thrusters and main propulsion\
  \  with a view to manoeuvr ing the vessel and hold ing it \nalongside .   \n4.2.8.\
  \  About five minutes after bollard 26 failed , all the remaining stern lines parted\
  \ or slipped off \ndamaged shore bollards , with the exception of one of the stern\
  \ line s that was surging on a set \nof mooring bitt s.  As the stern started to\
  \ drift off the berth , additional load came onto the two \naft spring lines and\
  \ within one minute one of the spring lines had parted and the second  had \nslipped\
  \ off a bollard that had failed.   The stern was now free to drift across the harbour\
  \ \ntoward s Number Two Wharf.  \n4.2.9.  As the bow and stern thrusters became\
  \ available , an attempt was made to stop arrest the  \nstern swinging down onto\
  \  the Milburn Carrier II  and subsequently Number Two Wharf.  By \ndesign the vessel\
  \ was only capable of moving sideways  into a prevailing wind (from the same \n\
  relative direction ) of approximately 35  knots  (see the polar diagram in Figure\
  \ 8).  This required \nall thrusters and main propellers to be available.  At best\
  \ it m ay have been possible to arrest \nthe swing but it was more likely to have\
  \  reduced the rate of drift toward s Number Two Wharf.  \n \nFigure 8 \nPolar plot\
  \ showing the crabbing capability  - quay on port side  shallow water  \n4.2.10.\
  \  There were  only six minutes between bollard  26 failing and contact being made\
  \ with the \nMilburn Carrier II .  An attempt was made , via v ery-high-frequency\
  \ radio , to alert  the Milburn \nCarrier II  to the events quickly unfolding .\
  \  It could not be established what channel  was used \nand the Milburn Carrier\
  \ II 's bridge team could not recall receiving the call.  They became \naware of\
  \ the situation when they felt the impact of the Seabourn Encore  amidships on the\
  \ \nstarboard side , while they were in the latter stages of berthing and already\
  \ had mooring lines \nashore .   \n4.2.11.  Once the Seabourn Encore 's stern  came\
  \ to rest , the master decided  to keep it pinned  against \nNumber Two W harf using\
  \ the propulsion that was available.  T he remaining head  lines and the \nstarboard\
  \ anchor were used to ho ld the bow close to Number One Wharf.  In doing so the\
  \ \nvessel  was kept relatively secure  until the weather conditions improved ,\
  \ tugs and a pilot \nbecame available , and it was  considered  safe to manoeuvre\
  \ back to Number One W harf.    \n4.2.12.  This accident  show ed how quickly events\
  \ unfolded and the importance of maintaining an \nawareness of environmental surroundings.\
  \  The master was un aware of the  predicted change \n\n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final\
  \ Report MO-2017-204 in weather pattern .  However,  having the bridge  and engine\
  \ room permanently mann ed while \nthe vessel wa s alongside  Number One Wharf \
  \ improved the reaction time  of the crew.  Once \nthe seriousness of the  situation\
  \ was recognised the crew 's actions were timely and effective  \ngiven the speed\
  \ with which events unfolded .   \n4.2.13.  Although the duty pilot  had passed\
  \ on a message, through the port security guard, advising  \nthe vessel of the approaching\
  \ southerly wind , the warning had failed to trigger any direct \nresponse from\
  \ the port and effectively left the ship to its own devices.  This is discussed\
  \ later \nin the report.  \n4.3. Why did some of the shore bollards and mooring\
  \ ropes fail? \nForces exerted on the vessel 's mooring ropes and shore bollards\
  \  \n4.3.1.  An analysis of the mooring arrangement at the time of the accident21\
  \ examined the load s \nimparted on individual mooring ropes and shore bollards\
  \ at a point in time when the wind had \nchanged to the south and was gusting up\
  \ to 45 knots.  The analysis assumed a pretension on \nthe lines of 5 tonnes and\
  \ the minimum breaking load reduced to 52 tonnes to allow for the \nbending of mooring\
  \ ropes arou nd fairleads .  The results of the analysis at around the time of \n\
  failure (see Table 5 ) show the approximate forces imparted o n bollards and ropes:\

  \ time shore  bollards  86, 87 and 26  failed, the mooring \nropes had not reached\
  \ their minimum breaking load  and were capable of absorbing \nconsiderably more\
  \ load.  In respect of the four remaining intact stern lines , further analysis\
  \ \nshow ed that the load on each rope increased until there was a sequential failure\
  \  of the three \nlongest lines.  The shortest stern line remained intact , but\
  \ as the load increased it started \nsurging on the mooring bitts . \n         \

  \ G 01, November 2017.  \nFinal Re port MO -2017 -204 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.3.3. \
  \ Theoretically, after bollard 26 failed the remaining stern lines that were leading\
  \ out from \nwinches should have rendered22 before they broke.  At least one of\
  \ these stern lines was seen \nto render, but eventually broke soon after.  \n4.3.4.\
  \  Industry good  practice in respect of safe mooring practices can be found in\
  \ the Oil Companies \nInternational Marine Forum (OCIMF) publication Mooring Equipment\
  \ Guidelines (4th Edition).  \n4.3.5.  The OCIMF publication explains that 't he\
  \ primary brake secures the drum, and thus th e \nmooring line, at the shipboard\
  \ end when the ship is moored.  The primary brake is designed to \nrender before\
  \ the loads become excessive to reduce the risk of mooring lines breaking '.  New\
  \ \nwinch brakes are normally designed to hold about 80%, of the moorin g line minimum\
  \ breaking \nload (MBL) .  In the case of Seabourn Encore  the winches were designed\
  \ to support a static \npull of 48 tonnes before rendering, which is 76% of the\
  \ mooring lines minimum breaking load .  \n4.3.6.  The OCIMF pu blication  advise\
  \ s setting the brake  in service to hold 60 % of the mooring rope  \nminimum braking\
  \ load .  However , the International Standards Organisation (ISO) 3730 \nrecommends\
  \ that  the brake holding capacity for new equipment should be initially left at\
  \ 80% \nof the MBL .  The ISO re commendation  makes an allowance for wear and tear\
  \ of the winch \nbrake  in service and so it is recommended that new equipment be\
  \ set up  to hold 80 % of the \ndesign MBL with a capability of adjusting the holding\
  \  load down to 60 % if required . \n4.3.7.  The Seab ourn  Encore 's mooring systems\
  \ were almost new, having only been commissioned to \nservice three  months before\
  \ the accident.  It could not be established with certainty what the \nwinches were\
  \ set to render at when commissioned, but it is about as likely as not that it wo\
  \ uld \nhave been at the 48 -tonnes maximum (76% of the mooring rope minimum breaking\
  \ load).  \nOne explanation for why the mooring ropes broke, rather than the winch\
  \ rendering is the \ntypical reduction in the rope's minimum breaking load caused\
  \ by the change in d irection as \nthe rope passes around mooring leads  and fairleads\
  \  at the ship's side .  \nBollard securing arrangement  \n4.3.8.  The Commission\
  \ recovered three of the four bolts  that had been used to s ecure bollard  26,\
  \ \nwhich  had recently undergone refurbishment  (Figure 9 ).  Two securing bolts\
  \  recovered  had \nbeen passed through the concrete section of the wharf, and the\
  \ remaining one had been \npassed through the wooden fendering at the face of the\
  \ wharf.   The bolts underwent \nmetallurgical examination to identify the failure\
  \ m ode and assess their suitability .23 \n4.3.9.  The subsequent examination report\
  \ concluded that:  \n\uF0B7 the bolts failed in shear at the weld  between the head\
  \ plate  and the bolt (Figure 1 0) \n\uF0B7 because of the d esign of the welded\
  \ bolt head arrangement , it was estimated that the \nbolts had an effective strength\
  \ of one-half to one -third  of a normal 32  mm-diameter bolt  \n\uF0B7 a comparison\
  \ to contempor ary bollard designs suggest ed that the use of only four such \n\
  welded head plate bolts to fix bollards would result in signi ficantly diminished\
  \ bollard \ncapacity, well below the loading ap plied to the bollards on the day\
  \ of the accident . \n4.3.10.  The bollard bolt heads failed as a result of shear\
  \ overload in the weld between the bolt shank \nand the head plate.   The total\
  \ shear area of all four bolts was 400 square millimetres,  which \nequates to about\
  \ 27 tonnes force if the load was equally distributed under the bolt head.  If \n\
  the loading was uneven the load could have been as low as 18 tonnes force.   As\
  \ shown in  \nTable 5 , any one of the two mooring ropes attached to bollard 26\
  \ would have likely exceeded \nthe holding capability of bollard 26.  The two mooring\
  \ ropes together caused a  total load on \nthe bollard of approximately 60 tonnes,\
  \  meaning failure of the bollard  was virtually certain at \nthe time of the weather\
  \ event.  \n                                                        \n22 A load\
  \ applied to the mooring winch which, when the brake is applied, causes the drum\
  \ to rotate in the \ndirec tion opposite to the driving torque.  \n23 Quest Integrity\

  \ lines to the ship  \n \nFigure 10 \nThe top (left) and bottom (right) welded bolt\
  \ head  plates , same design used to secure  bollard 26  \n4.3.11.  The metallurgical\
  \ analysis confirmed that the re was no significant loss of section due to \ncorrosion,\
  \ but that the shearing had occurred at the weld material , whic h had a total area\
  \ of \nabout half the cross -sectional area of the bolt shank.  The welded head\
  \ had therefore become \nthe weakest point in the securing arrangement  (Figure\
  \ 10 ). \n4.3.12.  The mooring ropes had an elevation of approximately 30\xB0 to\
  \ the horizontal and therefore had \na vertical component creating an uneven distribution\
  \ of load.  It is likely that the load s being \napplied to the bolt heads on bollard\
  \ 26 were  not equal.  As a result,  it is likely that the \nshearing force required\
  \ to cause failure w as less than that envisaged at design.  \n \nFigure 11 \nDecaying\
  \ timber  and corroded bolts  supporting bollards 47 (left) and 46 ( centre and\
  \ right)  \n4.3.13.  A vessel the size of the Seabourn Encore  has a windage area24\
  \ of about 5 ,800 square  metres , \nwhich  can impart significant loads on mooring\
  \ lines in strong wind conditions.  On the day of \n                           \
  \                             \n24 The exposed area of one side of a vessel above\
  \ the waterline.  \n\nFinal Re port MO -2017 -204 \n<< Page 21 >>\n the accident\
  \  the loads generated by the wind on the ship and imparted by the mooring ropes\
  \ \nexceeded the holding power of some shore bollards.  The reasons for this are\
  \  discussed \nbelow.  \n4.3.14.  The design used for attaching the head s of the\
  \ securing bolt s was a key component in \nproviding strength to the bollar ds.\
  \  The method used to weld the head s of the bolt s to the \nshaft s effectively\
  \ reduced the cross -sectional area s of the bo lts by at least 50% .  This \nintroduced\
  \ a weak point to the securing arrangement s.  Had the bolt head s been attached\
  \ to \nwithstand the same load as a 32  mm-diameter bolt , they would have failed\
  \ at approximately \n57 tonnes force, nearly three times the apparent  failure load.\
  \  \n4.3.15.  Another  factor was that some bollards were secured through decaying\
  \ timber at the face of \nthe wharf (Figure 11 ), which was the weakest point in\
  \ the securing arrangement.  The load on \nthe mooring ropes was transferred to\
  \ the bollard securing bolts  that passed through the  \nsupporting timber structure\
  \ .  The timber was unable to withstand the loads being applied and \ngave way,\
  \ causing the bollard s to fail .   \n4.3.16.  Another factor  was the inconsistency\
  \ in how bollards were  secured.  There were a number of \ndifferent bollard designs\
  \ and securing methods in use.  No bollard contained the maximum \npossible number\
  \ of securing bolts and the bolt head design for securing them was \ninconsistent\
  \  (Figure 12) .  As a consequence,  the bollards were not secured in a way co nsistent\
  \ \nto achieve their designed safe working load , making it virtually impossible\
  \ to establish a \nknown safe working load for each .   \n \nFigure 12 \nUnderutilisation\
  \ of the bollard securing arrangement  \n \n4.4. Integrity of the bollard securing\
  \ arrangement  \nSafety issue - The safe working loads of the bollards on Number\
  \ One Wharf were unknown  and \ntherefore  it was not possible to determine whether\
  \ the mooring plan for any ship was safe.    \nStructural condition of the wharf\
  \  \n4.4.1.  The 2016 enginee ring assessment of Number One Wharf, commissioned\
  \ by PrimePort Timaru  \nand carried out by Opus, identified deficiencies in the\
  \ condition of the supporting timber \nstructure .  As a result of the findings\
  \ PrimePort Timaru  commenced a long -term, risk -based \nprogramme of re placing\
  \ decaying timber.   \n4.4.2.  The engineering assessment did not examine  bollards\
  \ or the outer edge of the wharf , but as \npart of the work in progress for meeting\
  \ the needs of cruise vessels PrimePort Timaru \ncommenced a programme of installing\
  \ s ome new bollards  (Figure 13)  and replacing some \noriginal bollard securing\
  \ bolts.  \n4.4.3.  The new bollards were  set further back from the face of the\
  \ wharf and had a safe working load \nof 80 tonnes  stamped on the ir base s.  The\
  \ replaced bollard securing bolts were of  the same \ndesign as those described\
  \ earlier in this report.  \n\n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report MO-2017-204  \nFigure\
  \ 13 \nNewly installed steel bollard  \n4.4.4.  The lack of any historical records\
  \ held by PrimePort Timaru  in respect of bollard design and \nsecuring arrangements\
  \ meant that the safe working load s or capacity of the bollards were  \nunknown.\
  \  The various bollard designs and securing methods meant that each bollard was\
  \ \nlikely to have its own safe working load.   \n4.4.5.  There had never been a\
  \ programme of work to load -test bollards and establish their safe \nworking load\
  \ s.  As part of the risk -based approach to the  restoration and repair work being\
  \ \nundertaken it would have been appropriate for PrimePort Timaru to identify the\
  \ safe working \nload or  capacity of each bollard , including the new bollards\
  \ that had been  recently fitted.  \n4.4.6.  Three of the Seabourn Encore 's head\
  \  lines were each secured to one of the new bollards.  \nAlthough the mooring analysis\
  \ showed that the loads on these b ollards were  less than those \nat the stern\
  \ , the bollards  were secured using the same type of securing bolt as bollard 26\
  \ .  \nGiven the earlier explanation of the bolts ' failure it is highly likely\
  \ that the new bollards as \ninstalled would not have met  their designed 80 -tonne\
  \ capacity.  \n4.4.7.  Som e large , modern types of vessel, such as passenger and\
  \ container vessels, have large  \nwindage area s.  These vessels can impart significant\
  \ forces on a wharf structure and mooring \nbollards when the ship s are  exposed\
  \ to h igh winds from the direction of the wharf.  The overall \nforce th at wind\
  \ can impart on a ship  can be calculated , and from that the force  that the ship's\
  \ \nmooring lines impart on the wharf bollards can be calculated.  These calculations\
  \ can then be \ncompared to the safe working load s of the mooring bollards (if\
  \ known) to which the mooring \nlines are attached . \n4.4.8.  Only when these parameters\
  \ have been established can it be determined whether a berth is \nsuitable for a\
  \ vessel  to lie safely alongside.  Such parameters  help to identify operational\
  \ limits \nand provide guidance as to what additional control measures may be required\
  \  for different \nenvironmental conditions .  \n4.4.9.  Although PrimePort Timaru\
  \ had tried to mitigate some anticipated risks of berthing cruise \nvessels, the\
  \  arrival of  the Seabourn Encore  for the first time at Number One Wharf should\
  \ \nhave prompted both the port and the ship o perator  to satisfy themselves that\
  \ the allocated \nberth and the planned mooring arrangement were  fit for purpose\
  \ .   \n4.4.10.  Other Seabourn  Cruise  Line vessels had visited Timaru previously\
  \ , but this was the Seabourn \nEncore 's first visit.  On this occasion the company\
  \ had relied on its appointed commercial \nagent to determine berth suitability.\
  \ However, the agent 's assessment had primarily focused \non the commercial activities\
  \ of the vessel during its stay in Timaru.  \n\nFinal Re port MO -2017 -204 \n<<\
  \ Page 23 >>\n 4.4.11.  Regarding  berth suitability , the New Zealand Port and\
  \ Harbour Marine Safety Code , a voluntary \nnational standard,  advises a  port\
  \ operator in part to :   \nensure that all w harves, including structures, decking,\
  \ berthing facilities and bollards \nare suita ble for the ships that use them .\
  \   \nNotwithstanding t he need for a port operator to ensure that a wharf is suitable\
  \ , there is also a \nneed f or ship operators to  establish with t he port operator\
  \ the suitability of the wharf,  \npreferably through an  exchange of information\
  \ prior to the ship visit .   \n4.4.12.  The most recent document identif ying risks\
  \ within the harbour a t the time of the accident  was \nthe 2015 Timaru  pilotage\
  \ area risk assessment . Prepared in accordance with the New \nZealand Port and\
  \ Harbour Marine Safety Code , the assessment identified seven risks having \nsignificant\
  \ consequences requiring further scrutiny and attention to mitigations and controls.\
  \  \nPertinent to this accident  the risks included wind and wind gusts, vessel\
  \ mooring line parting \nand bollard/wharf structural failure.  \n4.4.13.  In relation\
  \ to these three risks the assessment made reference to the 2015 accident  involving\
  \ \nthe E.R. New York  breaking away  from the North Mole , an accident  after \
  \ which the port had \nmade  several recommendations .  Had all of the  recommendations\
  \  from the 2015 accident  \nbeen implemented throughout the port,  including Number\
  \ One Wharf, it is likely that this \naccident could have bee n avoided.  Unfortunately\
  \ , some measures were still being reviewed \nand others were only considered relevant\
  \ to the North Mole.  \n4.4.14.  The steady growth in the number of vessels with\
  \ large windage area s visiting New Zealand has \npredominantly reflected growth\
  \ in  the cruise and container sectors .  Port operators  have to be \ncognisant\
  \  of the fact  that some  New Zealand ports were never designed and constructed\
  \ to \naccept vessels  capable of imparting considerable loads on wharves and bollards\
  \ .   \n4.4.15.  Notwithstanding the advice contained in the New Zealand Port and\
  \ Harbour Marine Safety \nCode , port operators should also  consider the integrity\
  \ of the ir port infrastructure in relation to \nthe types of load that can be expected\
  \ when vessels with large windage are as are  exposed to \nstrong winds.  \n4.4.16.\
  \  To ensure that all New Zealand port operators are aware of the potential implications\
  \ of \nsecuring vessels with large windage area s in their ports , the Commission\
  \ has made a \nrecommendation to the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand to\
  \ promulgate through the \nSecretariat of the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code\
  \ Steering Group the findings of this \nreport , in particular the potential dangers\
  \ associated with securing vessels that may be \ncapable of generating loads in\
  \ excess of those that  the infrastructure can withstand .   \n4.4.17.  Whilst the\
  \ risks had been identified and kept under review , they had not been made 'as low\
  \ as \nreasonably practicable ' for the Seabourn Encore  alongside Number One Wharf.\
  \  Previous  \nlessons learnt had not been implemented  and therefore the control\
  \ measures in place at the \ntime of the accident we re not effective.   \n4.4.18.\
  \  The Commission would have made a recommendation to PrimePort Timaru to undertake\
  \ a \nthorough assessment of the port's mooring capabilit ies to establish the suitab\
  \ ility of wharf \nstructures and bollard securing arrangements for vessels approved\
  \ to enter the port.  Part of \nthat assessment would have been to determine the\
  \ maximum loading capacity of all bollards \nwithin the port and their suitability\
  \ in respect of the g uidance laid out in the Code of Practice \nfor Design of Fendering\
  \ and Mooring Systems.  However, this work is currently underway and \nis detailed\
  \ in section 7 of this report.  \n4.4.19.  Until this programme of work is complete\
  \ the Commission has made a r ecommend ation to \nPrimePort Timaru  to undertake\
  \ a type -specific ship -to-berth risk assessment for all vessels \nvisiting the\

  \ Final Report MO-2017-204 4.5. Adherence to  the port's procedures  for mooring\
  \ and high wind warning s \nSafety issue  - The mooring procedures contained in\
  \ the port  company's  SMS  were not strictly adhered \nto and the procedure in\
  \ the event o f a high wind warning was ineffective.  \n4.5.1.  Mooring procedures\
  \ contained in the port's Quality System Document had been updated to \nreflect\
  \ lessons learnt from the breakaway of E.R. New York  from the North Mole. The risk\
  \ of a \nvessel breaking away from its berth  had been considered and two key procedures\
  \ had been \ndeveloped as an outcome : high wind warning and advice on moorings.\
  \    \n4.5.2.  In the event of a high wind warning , the procedure in part required\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 the marine manager and/or duty pilot to check the local weather forecast\
  \  \n\uF0B7 when winds in excess of 35 knots were  forecast , the marine manager\
  \ or duty pilot to \nadvise the ship's agent to inform the vessel to put out extra\
  \ moorings  \n\uF0B7 a tug to be made ready for sea and placed on 10 minutes ' notice\
  \ .25  If a vessel require d \nassistance the tug  was to assist by pushing up alongside.\
  \  \n4.5.3.  The above procedures only applied to vessels berthed at the North Mole.\
  \  A strong wind event \nis relative to the size of the vessel and where it is berthed.\
  \   Every vessel must be considered \naccording  to its unique characteristics,\
  \ which is why ship -specific parameters are essential so \nthat any response  can\
  \ be  measured and effective.  Likewise , a wind warning procedure must \nconsider\
  \ all berths and ensure that the response is appropriate.  \n4.5.4.  On this occasion\
  \ t he duty pilot was monitoring the weather information  and attempt ed to alert\
  \ \nthe master with advance warning of the predicted increase in wind strength .\
  \  However,  the \nship's staff did not act on the information or p ass on the message\
  \ to the master .  Had they \ndone so  the master would undoubtedly have been better\
  \ placed to prepar e the ship for the \nworsening weather.   \n4.5.5.  Although\
  \ the ship could have been better prepared, on these sorts of occasion  it is likely\
  \ that  a \nship's master will also need assista nce from the port .  The port 's\
  \ own response to the high \nwind warning was rudimentary and did not automatically\
  \ trigger the type of support  and \nresources  the master  may have required ,\
  \ particularly if it had been decided  to run additional \nmooring lines (to the\
  \ correct bollards) or if a pilot and /or tugs were  required at short notice .\
  \   \n4.5.6.  There were two other o ption s for the duty pilot .  One would have\
  \ been to inform the vessel's \ncommercial agent  in accordance with the instructions\
  \ contained in  the high wind wa rning \nprocedure for the North Mole , and the\
  \ second would have been to contact the vessel directly \nand discuss with the master\
  \ the implications of the new weather information and jointly agree \nwhat action\
  \ needed to be taken.     \n4.5.7.  Had the master  and the pilot discussed the\
  \ situation  then  measures could have been taken  \nearlier , including running\
  \  additional mooring lines , prepar ing propulsion systems, and order ing \ntugs.\
  \  Collectively these measures could have  reduc ed the weight on the mooring ropes\
  \ and in \nturn the load o n the shore bollards.   It is feasible  that the reduction\
  \ in load may have \nprevented the bollard  failure . \n4.5.8.  As part of the port's\
  \ risk control measures , shore bollards had been colour coded to identify \nthose\
  \ that  were suitable for use.  The mooring procedure required n o more than one\
  \ mooring \nline to be placed over a bollard , and w here possible steel bollards\
  \ were to be used in \npreference to timber bollards .  Any change in the procedure\
  \ required approval fr om the duty \npilot.     \n4.5.9.  Although the mooring hands\
  \ had been trained in the required mooring procedures , one stern \nline had been\
  \  place d over a timber bollard , and t wo stern lines had been  placed over steel\
  \ \n                                                        \n25 Placing tugs on\
  \ stand -by when large -windage vessels are on the North Mole and a high north -westerly\
  \ wind \nis forecast.  \nFinal Re port MO -2017 -204 \n<< Page 25 >>\n bollard 26,\
  \ a refurbished bollard used for servic ing cruise vessels.  It was a departure\
  \ from the \nprocedure and one that had not been approved by the duty pilot.   \n\
  4.5.10.  Placing two stern lines on bollard  26 significantly  increased the load\
  \ and highly likely \ncontributed to its failure .  Notwithstanding that, resu lts\
  \ showed that had only one line been \nplaced on bollard 26 the load being imparted\
  \ by that one line could have been sufficient to \ncause failure anyway.  \n4.5.11.\
  \  As previously discussed , there were similarities between this accident  and\
  \ the  previous  2015 \naccident .  Although control measures had been implemented\
  \ and incorporated as a result  of \nthe previous accident , this accident  shows\
  \ that further work is still required .  A robust port \nresponse to a high wind\
  \ event, the ability to promulgate  weather information effectively, and \ntan assessment\
  \ of  each  ship and its mooring arrangement for a proposed berth  would \nimprove\
  \ the safety of vessels berthed at PrimePort  Timaru .   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\
