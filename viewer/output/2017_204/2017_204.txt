The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 12 February 2017, the passenger ship Seabourn  Encore  was berthed at Number One 
Wharf in PrimePort  Timaru to facilitate passenger excursions ashore.   The ship w as secured to 
mooring bollards on the wharf using its own mooring lines.  
1.2. During the day the weather changed rapidly and earlier than predicted.  The wind increased in 
intensity and changed direction so as to push the ship away from the wharf.  As a result,  a 
number of mooring bollards on the wharf  progressively failed by tearing from the wharf.  
1.3. The resulting load on the remaining mooring lines caused them to break , and the stern of the 
ship swung across the harbour and collided with a bulk cement carrier th at was in the process 
of berthing at an adjacent wharf.  The Seabourn  Encore ’s crew were able to establish power to 
the ship’s propulsion systems in time to lessen the impact and to maintain control of the ship 
until the wind abated enough to re -secure the ship to its berth with the aid of a harbour pilot 
and tugs.  
1.4. As well as the damage to the wharf, t he hull of the bulk cement carrier w as holed near the 
waterline, but the damage occurred where a water ballast tank was located so did not 
materially affec t the ship’s stability.  The Seabourn  Encore  sustained damage to its shell 
plating.  Nobody was injured.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the Seabourn  
Encore ’s mooring lines and associated equipment were in good condi tion and were not factor s 
contributing to the accident.  However, the mooring bollards failed because the unique 
method with which each had been  fastened to the wharf and/or the strength of the underlying 
wharf structure meant they were  unable to withstand  the forces imparted on them by the 
Seabourn  Encore ’s mooring lines.  
1.6. The Commission also found  that the port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual 
safe working loads of the various mooring bollards on the wharf and that the mooring 
procedures for the port were not strictly followed.  
1.7. The Commission also found  that the documented port compa ny response to a predicted 
weather event was not strictly followed, which was a factor  in neither the ship’s crew nor the 
port company resources being fully prepared to respond to the predicted change in weather in 
a timely manner.  However, the prompt actions taken by the ship’s crew when the weather 
event occurred very likely reduced the consequences of the accident.  
1.8. The Commission identified two safety issues : 
 the safe working loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown and 
therefore it was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was 
safe 
 the mooring pro cedures contained in the port  company ’s safety management system 
were not strictly adhered to and the procedure in the event of a high wind warning was 
ineffective . 
1.9. The Commission made a recommendation  to the port operator to address these safety issues . 
1.10.  The key lessons identified from the inquiry into this occurrence include : 
 port companies must be aware of the safe working load s of their mooring 
infrastructure in order to produce safe and effective ship mooring plans  
 procedures for monitoring and communic ating weather conditions must be robust and 
strictly followed when harbouring ships that are prone to high winds.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Maritime New Zealand  notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) 
of the occurrence on 12 February 2017, the day of the occurrence.  The Commission opened 
an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 
and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 13 February 2017 two investigators travelled to Akaroa  where  the Seabourn Encore  was 
lying at anchor.  They interview ed the master, obtained a download of the voyage data 
recorder, secured documentary evidence, and took photographs of the damage .   
2.3. On 14 February 2017 contact was established with the Bahamas Flag State administration 
and agreement was reached that New Zealand would lead the investigation and conduct the 
investigation on behalf of  the Bahamas.  The flag state administration had requested that the 
operator of the Seabourn Encore  conduct an inter nal investigation.   
2.4. On 14 February 2017 in vestigators interviewed the Canterbury harbourmaster and the master 
of the Milburn Carrier II .  Damaged bollards from the quay and parted mooring ropes from the 
Seabourn Encore  were secured.  
2.5. On 16 February  2017 co mmunications were established with the Seabourn Encore ’s operator.   
2.6. On 24 February 2017 investigators travelled to Timaru and interviewed the port marine 
manager and the port infrastructure manager.  Documentary evidence was obtained . 
2.7. On 27 April 2017  investigators travelled to Timaru  and conducted a second interview with  the 
port infrastructure manager.  Interviews were also conducted with the duty pilot on the day of 
the accident  and the chief executive officer.  PrimePort Timaru  provide d the Commiss ion with 
a selection of sample bolts used for securing the shore bollards.  
2.8. On 28 September 2017 an interview was conducted with the quay watchkeeper  on duty at the 
time of the accident . 
2.9. The Commission engaged Quest Integrity to conduct a metallurgy examin ation of the failed 
bollard securing bolts.  
2.10.  The operator engaged a naval architect to conduct a mooring load analysis using the Optimoor  
software.  The Commission obtained a copy of the report  and referred to it in its draft analysis 
of the facts  
2.11.  On 25 Oct ober 2018 , the Commission approved the draft report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment.  The draft report was sent to 11 interested persons for comment.  
2.12.  The Commission received submissions from eight  interested persons.  
2.13.  As a result of the s ubmissions received,  the Commission engaged another  expert to conduct 
an independent Optimoor mooring analysis.  The results of the second independent  Optimoor 
mooring analysis were broadly consistent with the findings of the first Optimoor  mooring 
analysis that had been commissioned by the operator.  
2.14.  Any changes as a result of the submissions have been included in the final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  At 0655 on 12 February 2017, the Timaru pilot and an assistant  pilot boarded  the Seabourn 
Encore  to assist the vessel to enter  the harbour . 
3.1.2.  At 0711 the master -pilot exchange of information took place  on the bridge.  Based on the 
forecast  that the wind was going to develop from the south at 15- to 20 -knots2 , it was agreed 
that the final moorings would consist of six head  lines3 and six stern lines4, and two forward 
springs5 and two aft springs.    
3.1.3.  At 0718 all pre -arrival checks had been completed and no deficiencies noted.  
3.1.4.  At 0758 the Seabourn Encore  arrived alongside at Timaru and commenced secur ing 
starboard side alongside Number One Wharf.  At 0809 the engine control room reduce d to 
running one diesel generator . 
3.1.5.  At 0825  the vessel was all secure  with six head and six stern lines  and two forward and two 
aft springs .  The line of the berth was 048/228˚ (degrees)  (see Figure 1) . 
 
Figure 1 
Mooring arrangement alongside Number One Wharf 
 
3.1.6.  At approximately 0825  the shore gangway was connected at 4 deck level, inspected and 
found safe to use.  Passengers commenced disembarking to shore shortly afterwards.  
3.1.7.  The Seabourn Encore ’s bridge was permanently manned by bridge watchkeeping officers in 
port.  In the same way  that the officer  of the watch assumed responsibility for the conduct of 
the vessel while at sea, the officer of the watch was  also the master ’s representative

 Final Report MO-2017-204 responsible for the bridge watch while the ship was in port.  At 0900 , the bridge logbook 
show ed, the wind direction was 289 °(degrees) , speed 1.6 knots.  
3.1.8.  At 1200 the second officer was preparing to take over the bridge watch , and recorded  in the 
deck logbook that  the wind direction  was 038° at a speed of 4.5 knots.   
3.1.9.  At approximately 133 0 the dut y pilot was monitoring the weather information  from his home 
computer and noticed that the wind speed in O amaru, 85 kilometres south o f Timaru , had 
increased to 30 knots from the south about four hours earlier than predicted .   
3.1.10.  The pilot  contacted  the security staff stationed at the entrance to Number One Wharf and 
advised them  that a southerly wind was due in about one hour .   
3.1.11.  A security guard noted the details on a piece of paper : “southerlies due half hour to one hour 
2:30pm to 3:00pm, 30 knots O amaru ”.  The security guard then walked on board the 
Seabourn Encore  and verbally passed on the message to  the ship’s staff at reception and 
asked them to inform the bridge.   The receptionist telephoned the bridge and passed on the 
message regarding the ap proaching weather system.  The message was not passed on to the 
master.    
3.1.12.  At 1400 the  officer of the watch made an entry in the deck logbook and recorded that  the 
wind direction was from 320° at a speed of 3.5 knots.  An entry by the same officer of the 
watch  at 1500 noted the wind direction as being from 231° a t a speed of nine knots.  
3.1.13.  At 1500 the master visited the bridge to carry out some administrative paperwork . 
3.1.14.  Shortly before 1515 the master was standing at  the port bridge wing  watching the Milburn 
Carrier II  manoeuvre stern first into Number Two Wharf when  he felt the vessel heel sharply to 
port.  He walked across to the starboard bridge wing to investigate and noticed a significant 
change in the wind direction and strength.  The wind direction had b acked6 to the south  and it 
had increased in strength to 22-25 knots, which was pushing the vessel off the berth.  
3.1.15.  At 1516 the ship experienced the effects of a sudden heavy squall.  The wind remained 
southerly , which was 135° relative  to the ship ’s head ing, gusting up to 45 knots  and pushing 
the Seabourn Encore  off the berth.   From the bridge t he master estimated  that the stern was 
about four metres (m)  away from the wharf .  He took charge of the ship from the officer of the 
watch  and ordered two diesel gene rators so that a bow and stern thruster could be used to try 
to bring the vessel b ack alongside.  He also ordered all watertight doors to be closed.

 3.1.16.  Seconds later  a shore mooring bollard holding a forward spring failed , rendering the mooring 
line ineffective.  This was followed  seconds later by the failure of an aft shore mooring bollard  
holding two stern lines  (see Figure 2). Both lines became ineffective.  Second s later the 
bollard holding the second forward spring failed , rendering that line  also ineffective.   
3.1.17.  At about 1520 three diesel generators were available  and one bow thruster and one stern 
thruster became  available for manoeuvring.  The master then ordere d four diesel generators 
in preparation for using the main propulsion.   As they were being prepared , three of the 
remaining aft mooring lines broke  and the stern drifted away from the berth towards Number 
Two Wharf.  Only the short est stern line remained intact.  T he additional weight  caused  it to 
surge on the mooring bitts7 and allowed the Seaborn Encore ’s stern to drift across the 
harbour.   
3.1.18.  At 1521 both stern thrusters were thrusting full to starboard.  T he wind was gusting to 45 
knots when  the Seabourn  Encore ’s port quarter8 made contact with the starboard side, 
midships, of the Milburn Carrier II , which was in the latter stages of berthing and already had 
mooring lines ashore  (see Figure 3).  
3.1.19.  One minute later at 1522,  both bow and stern thrusters were available and thrusting full to 
starboard  and t he main propulsion was available on bridge control.  
3.1.20.  The port quarter of  the Seabourn Encore  continued swinging around, cleared  the Milburn 
Carrier II  and came to rest on the quay side of Number Two Wharf.  The master used  all four 
thrusters to keep the vessel wedged between Numbers One and Two Wharfs .

3.1.21.  Two head  lines parted under the additional load  and at  about 1526 t he starboard anchor was

 Final Report MO-2017-204 3.1.23.  At 1531 the chi ef engineer confirmed that all four diesel generators were available and that 
the vessel’s flooding sensors had not been activated.  At 1532 an announcement was made 
to inform passengers about the circumstances of the accident .  
3.1.24.  At 1552 the duty pilot boarded the vessel and by 1601 the two harbour tugs were secure on 
the port quarter and the port bow.    
3.1.25.  At 1806 a bridge team briefing was held . The master and pilot agreed to postpone any 
attempt to manoeuvre back to Number One Wharf until the wind had ab ated to less than 20 
knots.  
3.1.26.  At 1900 the wind strength was recorded  as 11.9 knots  and by about 1955  the Seabourn 
Encore  had re -secured to Number One Wharf to allow all passengers to re -board the vessel.   
3.1.27.  The damage was inspected by a Maritime New Zealand  maritime officer, the harbourmaster, a 
protection and indemnity10 surveyor and the staff captain.  It was decided to allow the vessel 
to sail to its next port.  At 2356  the Seabourn Encore  departed Timaru for Akaroa.   
3.2. Sequence of mooring failure  
3.2.1.  Evidence provided by the port’s close d-circuit television  (CCTV) security camera showed that 
the failure of shore bollards and ropes occurred in the following sequence :

 Final Report MO-2017-204 3.3. Damage assessment   
3.3.1.  A class ification society11 survey by Registro Italiano Navale  was carried out  on board  the 
Seaborn Encore  in Melbourne, Australia on 3 March 2017.  The survey found that the damage 
consisted of a side shell indentation on the port side between frames -11 and -13 inside the 
marina store.  The damage extended 2 -2.5 m above the waterline and was approximately 1. 8 
m in length and 1.6 m in height. The maximum indentation was 600  millimetres ( mm).  An 
approved temporary repair was carried out using four steel brackets connecting two side shell 
longitudinal  frames  and the indented hull plating.  
3.3.2.  The Milburn Carrier I I suffered damage to the shell plating in way of the number three top wing 
saltwater ballast tank.  The hull was penetrated and saltwater ballast was emptying into the 
harbour from below the waterline.  The tank was pumped dry and the damage to the shell 
plating rose above the waterline (see Figure 4).

3.4. Environmental conditions  
3.4.1.  A weather forecast  was produced by Weather Routing Incorporated for  the Seabourn Encore ’s 
visit to Timaru on 12 February 2017 ; the details are reproduced in Table 2 .  The wind pattern 
was being generated by an anticyclone ( high pressure ) 1,020 mb (millibars) , situated 240 
kilometres  south -east of Timaru.  The system was producing a predominantly north -westerly 
airstream for the duration of the Seaborn Encore ’s visit.  The vessel was due to depart Timaru 
at 1800 that evening.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 3.5. Mooring arra ngement alongside Number One Wharf 
3.5.1.  Figure 5 shows the mooring arrangement s forward and aft on  the Seabourn Encore .  At the 
bow, six of the eight mooring lines were secured on dedicated split drum winches.  The 
remaining t wo head  lines were secured on mooring bitts.  Seven o f the eight lines were run 
through roller fairleads12 and one head line was run through a panama fairlead .13  Similarly , at 
the stern , six of the eight mooring lines were secured  on split drum winches and the remaining 
two were secured to mooring bitts.  Five of the eight mooring lines were  run through roller 
fairleads and three were  run through panama fairleads.  All the mooring lines were fairly 
equally tensioned , and roller fai rleads were later observed to be functioning correctly.

3.5.2.  Figure 5 shows , to scale , the mooring line configuration and the shore mooring bollards used 
to secure the lines .  All the lines were run to separate shore bollards with the exception of two 
stern lines placed on bollard 26.   
3.5.3.  The mooring winches could be used in auto -tension mode or manual mode .  On the day of the 
accident  the winches were in manual mode and the mooring ropes were secured on the brake 
of the split drum winches  (see Figure 6).  Two additional lines forward and aft were  secured to 
mooring bitts . 
3.6. Mooring equipment  on board the Seabourn Encore  
3.6.1.  The mooring equipment  on the forward and aft mooring decks includ ed winches, fairleads, 
rollers, bitts and associated electrical installation s, which had been  certified by the Registro 
Italiano Navale (RINA) classification society as having being tested and found to b e in 
compliance with the requirements of RINA’s rules.    
                                                        
12 A fairlead is an opening at the forward and aft ends of a vessel used to guide a rope, usually to a tug or to 
the shore, keep ing it clear of obstructions and preventing it cutting or chafing . A roller fairlead is  a type of 
fairlead designed to reduce the amount of friction on a rope . 
13 A type of fairlead  specifically designed for use when  a vessel is being towed through the Panama Canal,  
but also used for routine mooring operations.

Figure 6 
Split drum mooring winch used to secure mooring lines on  board the Seabourn Encore  
3.6.2.  Each of the split drum mooring winches were designed for a synthetic rope 64mm in diameter 
with a minimum breaking load of 59 tonnes.  The mooring winches were certified by RINA in 
August 2015 and commissioned in December 2016.  All mooring winches supported a static 
pull on the brake of 48 tonnes, which was 76 % of the design mooring rope  minimum breaking 
load (MBL) fitted on the winches . 
3.6.3.  The mooring  ropes supplied to the vessel were described as “12 Strand Eurodan ropes in 
standard white colour with blue T.Y. with 1.8 metre canvas covered eye splice at both end s”.  
The mooring ropes had been  supplied by Global Marine Supplies in Genoa, Italy  (Appendix 1).  
They had been certified by classification society Det Norske Veritas – Germanischer Lloyd  
after witnessing breaking load testing on random samples that failed  at 65 ,484 kilogram -force 
(kgf) (Appendix  2).  The testing had complied with BS EN14 ISO 2307:2010.   Further tests had 
been  carried out at the rope manufacturer ’s premises on 23 August 2016, witnessed and 
certified by the Lloyd ’s Register classification society . 
3.6.4.  Each rope had been  manufactured from a mix of polypropylene and high-tenacity15 
polyethylene , and as such had an optimal balance between strength and  ability to stretch 
under load .  The rope s did not absorb water, floated, and had a melting point of  170°C.  The 
ropes were reputed to have good abrasion, chemical and ultraviolet resistance.  Each mooring 
rope was 60 mm in diameter and had a mi nimum required breaking strength of 63,000 kgf.  
Ropes had been  supplied in two lengths , 200 m and 220  m, and w ere compatible with the 
mooring winch requirements.  
3.7. Number One Wharf  
3.7.1.  Number One Wharf was constructed in 1878  and there had  been a number of modifications, 
additions and repairs carried out since.  With a length of 380  m and a width of 10  m, the 
wharf had been  constructed using hardwood timber piles , timber beams and stringers, and 
more recently a 100 mm thick concrete deck  had been laid over the wooden ‘hit and miss16’ 
deck  (see Figure 7).

3.7.2.  An engineering assessment of the wharf structure was commissioned by PrimePort Timaru  in 
early 2016.  It was carried out by Opus International Consultants Limited (Opus) between 
February 2016 and April 2016.  The inspection r eport was comp leted on 9 May 2016.  The 
purpose of the inspection was to allow the port company to have a better understanding of the 
condition of key elements of the structure and to better inform any future maintenance plan.  
3.7.3.  The i nspection of the wharf  was limited due to access , but it did inc lude an examination of the 
timber stringers, beams and piles down to water level . It excluded bollards, piles below water 
level , and the outer edge of the wharf .  The outer two stringers and the ends of some beams 
were not inspected.  
3.7.4.  The inspection found decay in many of the stringers and beams  and identified that 
considerable restorative work was required as a high or urgent priority .  Some areas of the 
wharf were not to be used  until restorative work was completed.  The report identified a 
methodology with which replacement or maintenance intervention s could be undertaken  and 
made several recommend ations  that included : 
 broken piles are replaced or repaired  
 excessive decay ed beam s and stringers are replaced or repaired  
 an inspection regime is adopted and implemented to monitor further decay across all 
members  
 a structured management plan to end of life is progressively developed and implemented 
to manage residual ri sk and maintena nce requirements  
 PrimePort Timaru  and Opus discuss access/inspection process for the seaward stringer, 
row A piles and end of beams over row A piles for future maintenance management.  
3.7.5.  As a result of t he inspection report the infrastructure manager commence d a risk -based 
approach to dealing with the repairs .  By January 2017 the high -risk areas had been 
completed, approximately 35 piles  and 40 structural beams had been replaced and parts of 
the wharf had been down -rated.   
3.7.6.  The engineering assessment carried out on the wharf structure in 2016 did not examine t he 
bollard securing arrangement .  However, as structural repairs on the wharf progressed the 
opportunity was taken to examine the tops of piles used for securing steel mooring bollards.  
Where the timber structure under a bollard had been repaired , the Pile Repair Progress Report 
showed that t he port company had taken the opportunity to fit new securing bolts to some of 

Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 13 >>
 the steel bollards (Figure 11).  Some n ew steel bollards had also been fitted approxima tely 2 
m back from the face of the wharf , where the supporting timber structure was conside red to 
be in better condition.  These were specifically to service cruise vessels.  
3.7.7.  There were no technical drawings or documentation available to assist the infrastr ucture 
manager to understand the safe working load s with which  the bollards had originally been 
designed.  The methodology for securing the new bollards and re -securing original bollards 
was on a ‘like for like’ basis.  
3.7.8.  To assist the shore mooring hands17 to identify which bollards could be used , a green dot was 
painted adjacent to each  bollard. Those that were not to be used had red dot s painted 
adjacent to them.   
3.8. PrimePort Timaru  – port risk assessment  
3.8.1.  A port and harbour safety code navigational risk ass essment was carried out by Marico Marine  
NZ Limited  in 2006 on behalf of PrimePort Timaru . The resulting report w as one of several 
documents from which the port develop ed a harbour safety management system (SMS).   
3.8.2.  In respect of Number One Wharf the risk assessment identified that the wharf was used for 
handling fishing vessels and as a base for the port ’s tug and pilot boat.  
3.8.3.  The assessment considered navigational, berthing and mooring issues , noting that PrimePort 
Timaru  no longer maintain ed its own storm lines  and recommending that vessel s instead 
carried sufficient lines for their needs.  It also identified that the failure of bollards was 
considered by stakeholders to be a signif icant risk within the port area:  
Wharf structures and mooring bollards are not surveyed for integrity beyond a 
monthly visual inspection by the marine manager.  Bollards and piles used for 
mooring are considered to have breaking strains of around 24 tonnes while the 
mooring winches of containerships are capable of ap plying 40 tonnes.  
The marine manager reported a policy to place only one line on each bollard or pile…  
In practice, it is not always possible to achieve this policy without installing more 
bollards.  It is understood that a programme of bollard installatio n is in place to 
achieve the  policy.  
3.8.4.  The assessment also exa mined the effect s of a beam wind  on a 200  m passenger vessel.  In 
conclusion it recommended that in the event of a mooring failure in high winds ( 40-50 knots) , 
handling a vessel would not be possi ble and would “certainly require more than a second tug ”.  
In cost -benefit  analysis terms it was considered that the strategy of increasing the available 
bollard disposition was a more prudent course of action.  
3.8.5.  In conclusion , the assessment  report  referred  to the fact that the port’s policy was to retain a 
vessel in the harbour during storm events and recommended “the ongoing introduction of 
mooring bollards to facilitate one line per bollard a nd a periodic structural inspection of its 
jetty facilities” .  
3.8.6.  The 2006 port risk assessment was reviewed in 2011  and May 2013 , and in May 2015  
another port risk assessment report was published.  It identified the risk of a bollard/wharf 
structure failure.  Key control measures included ; regulations and legislation, c ommercial 
vessel operations, berthing operations, and training.  The risk rating fell within the “tolerable ” 
risk definition and action required was “Risk within the ALARP [as low as reasonably 
practicable] area, procedures and controls to be reviewed ”.   
3.8.7.  A further risk review was carried out in 2015, and post the accident  in 2017 .

 Final Report MO-2017-204 3.9. PrimePort Timaru  – harbour safety management system  
3.9.1.  On 12 March 2015 the Director of Maritime New Zealand confirmed in writing that the SMS 
for PrimePort Timaru  had been assessed and was confirmed as meeting the requirements of 
the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code.  Developed jointly by Environment 
Canterbury and the port company , the code comprised both the council’s and the port 
company’s SMS.  
3.9.2.  Contained with in the SMS were the i nstructions for vessel moorings .  The instructions 
recommended that vessel s longer  than 135  m secure using four head and four stern lines and 
two springs at each end.  
3.9.3.  The instructions advised that in the event of a strong w ind warning , the pilot should advise the 
master to take extra precautions such as running additional mooring lines.  
3.9.4.  The instruction s made reference to bollards and stated that , “where possible steel bollards 
should be used when a choice is possible.  Unless approved by the pilot the linesman should 
adhere to one line per bollard.  It is possible to have two lines on certain steel bollards but this 
should be avoided where possible ”.   
3.9.5.  The SMS  also included a procedure for the actions to be taken in the  event of a high wind 
warning.  The mar ine manager  or duty pi lot was to check the local weather forecast regularly , 
particularly when bad weather was expected.  When winds in excess of steady north -westerly 
35 knots were  forecast , the vessel was expected to  run extra moorings.  The tug would  be 
readied for sea and placed on 10 minutes ’ notice.  
3.10.  Previous accident  
3.10.1.   On 4 February 2015  the container vessel E.R. New York  broke loose off the PrimePort Timaru 
North Mole berth when two timber bollards failed and a sh ip’s line broke .  The vessel was 
brought back safely alongside by two tugs within 35 minutes of  its breaking loose.  The vessel 
had berthed in an unusual position that did not facilitate the procedure of one line per bollard 
and the use of steel bollards.  
3.10.2.  On that occasion n orth-westerly winds had reached 41 knots.  The lateral force imposed by 
the wind on the vessel meant that the stern bollards were experiencing a load of more than  25 
tonnes at the time of the failure.  
3.10.3.  The causal factor was determined as “a lack of a mooring plan for this class of vessel at 
Timaru and a subsequent lack of contingency planning ”.  Further contributory factors included:  
 a lack of clear communication between pilots and mooring staff  
 a lack of clear lines of responsibility  
 procedural failures in training mooring staff  
 a system failure in predicting strong winds locally . 
3.10.4.  The port ’s internal investigation into the accident  made several recommendations , which 
included  in part : 
 undertake a  full analysis of the strength of steel b ollards and  the lateral capacity of the 
wharf18 
 establish a new vessel arrival plan for each new class of vessel arriving at the port  
 analyse the safe working load of all steel bollards  
 install new steel bollards (appropriately rated) at locations determine d with pilots  
 establish local weather forecasting  
                                                        
18 North Mole.  
Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 15 >>
  set up clear communication and responsibility for mooring vessels  
 ensure reiterating one line per bollard and proper communication between mooring hand 
and pilot/master in case of deviation.  
3.11.  Code of practic e for the design of mooring systems  
3.11.1.  Part four of British Stan dard 6349 :1994 : Code of Practice for Design of Fendering and 
Mooring Systems provides a reference for calculating expected horizontal loads on shore 
mooring points (bollards).  Section 10.2 of the code  provides methods for calculating the 
expected loads on mooring points for vessels over 20,000 tonnes ’ displacement.  In the event 
of insufficient data being available to carry out the calculations , the standard advises that for 
cargo vessels and bulk carriers between 20,000 and 50,000 tonnes ’ displacement  (the 
Seabourn Encore ’s displacement was 24,397 tonnes ) a mooring point should be rated to 80 
tonnes.  For locations with exceptional wind , the mooring point loads should be increa sed by 
25%.   
3.11.2.  The code also advises that the design of the mooring point should be such that if it becomes 
overloaded the mooring equipment or its anchorage to the structure will fail before the overall 
structure is damaged.  
3.11.3.  Examples of various designs of mooring bollards are provided in the code , together with the 
standard s of the material s required for manufacture.  The code does not provide advice on the 
required arrangement for secur ing a bollard to a structure other than to say it should be 
robust, of simple design and designed to minimi se maintenance.  The design of a securing 
arrangement for a harbour mooring system is generally considered to be the  function of a 
qualified structural engineer .  
3.11.4.  Table 9 of the code provides information on the sizes and breaking load s of synthetic mooring 
ropes normally carried by vessels.  For a cruise vessel the size of the Seabourn Encore , the 
diameter is expected to be 64-72 mm and the breaking load  46.6 -58.4 tonnes.   The mooring 
ropes carried on  board the Seabourn  Encore  had a breaking strength of 65 tonnes.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  A large cruise vessel such as the Seabourn Encore  breaking away from its berth could have 
had serious  consequences.  Although the ship could have been better prepared for the 
weather event had  the message from the pilot reached the master, once the weather event 
occurred,  the prompt  reaction  by the ship’s crew  reduced the risk of harm to people  and 
damage to  property and the environment.  Nevertheless , the Milburn Carrier II , the Seabourn 
Encor e and Number One and Number Two Wharves still suffered damage , and there was a 
risk of injury to passengers and other personnel who could easily have been occupying the 
wharf at the time . 
4.1.2.  A similar event had occurred at the port in February 2015.  The port’s own investigation report 
on that accident  had made several important recommendations that required addressing by 
the port  company .  This latest accident  identified some similarities between the two events 
and show ed that further progress is still re quired to ensure that large vessels , including cruise 
vessels , can remain safely alongside in adverse weather conditions.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses  why the Seabourn Encore  broke away from its berth , and 
discusses two safety issues:  
 the safe working loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown and 
therefore it was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe  
 the mooring procedures contained in the port’s SMS  were not strictly adhered to and the 
proced ure in the event of a high wind warning was ineffective.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The Seabourn Encore  was secured to Number One W harf using  six head  lines, six stern lines  
and two forward and two aft springs .  This exceeded the standard securing arrangement by 
using  an additional  two head  lines and two additional stern lines. The decision was based on 
information in the weather forecast  and an expectation that the wind speed would be no more 
than 2 0 knots from the south later that afternoon.   
4.2.2.  All the mooring ropes were in good condition ; they followed good leads  from the winches  and 
passed  through well maintained panama and roller fairleads .   
4.2.3.  At the time of the accident  the tide was rising.  CCTV footage showed that a ll the stern lines 
leading from wi nches were fairly equally tension ed with a small amount of slack  on two lines 
that were turned up on sets of mooring bi tts.  
4.2.4.  When the  wind changed toward s the south , the relative wind direction19 was about  135°  and 
pushing on  to the vessel ’s starboard quarter .  As the wind speed increased , the effect s were  
that the vessel tried to move bodily forward and the stern  tried  to move off the berth.  A 
warehouse on the wharf was affording the forward half of the vessel some protection from the 
wind.   
4.2.5.  The weig ht on the forward springs and stern lines increased significantly , with a consequent 
increase in the load being applied to the corresponding shore bollards .  When the wind speed 
gusted to 45 knots, bollards 86  and 87, each holding a forward spring, and bollard 26 holding 
two stern lines  all failed20 within about 28 seconds . 
4.2.6.  This meant that f our of the eight mooring ropes that were providing the majority of the holding 
power were  rendered ineffective  and the remaining mooring ropes and shore bollards were 
now required to take significantly more load.

 4.2.7.  As the load on the remaining mooring lines increased , the stern  started to move further off the 
berth .  The bridge team had already observed events on the wharf and progressively ordered 
power for thrusters and main propulsion  with a view to manoeuvr ing the vessel and hold ing it 
alongside .   
4.2.8.  About five minutes after bollard 26 failed , all the remaining stern lines parted or slipped off 
damaged shore bollards , with the exception of one of the stern line s that was surging on a set 
of mooring bitt s.  As the stern started to drift off the berth , additional load came onto the two 
aft spring lines and within one minute one of the spring lines had parted and the second  had 
slipped off a bollard that had failed.   The stern was now free to drift across the harbour 
toward s Number Two Wharf.  
4.2.9.  As the bow and stern thrusters became available , an attempt was made to stop arrest the  
stern swinging down onto  the Milburn Carrier II  and subsequently Number Two Wharf.  By 
design the vessel was only capable of moving sideways  into a prevailing wind (from the same 
relative direction ) of approximately 35  knots  (see the polar diagram in Figure 8).  This required 
all thrusters and main propellers to be available.  At best it m ay have been possible to arrest 
the swing but it was more likely to have  reduced the rate of drift toward s Number Two Wharf.

4.2.10.  There were  only six minutes between bollard  26 failing and contact being made with the 
Milburn Carrier II .  An attempt was made , via v ery-high-frequency radio , to alert  the Milburn 
Carrier II  to the events quickly unfolding .  It could not be established what channel  was used 
and the Milburn Carrier II ’s bridge team could not recall receiving the call.  They became 
aware of the situation when they felt the impact of the Seabourn Encore  amidships on the 
starboard side , while they were in the latter stages of berthing and already had mooring lines 
ashore .   
4.2.11.  Once the Seabourn Encore ’s stern  came to rest , the master decided  to keep it pinned  against 
Number Two W harf using the propulsion that was available.  T he remaining head  lines and the 
starboard anchor were used to ho ld the bow close to Number One Wharf.  In doing so the 
vessel  was kept relatively secure  until the weather conditions improved , tugs and a pilot 
became available , and it was  considered  safe to manoeuvre back to Number One W harf.    
4.2.12.  This accident  show ed how quickly events unfolded and the importance of maintaining an 
awareness of environmental surroundings.  The master was un aware of the  predicted change 


<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report MO-2017-204 in weather pattern .  However,  having the bridge  and engine room permanently mann ed while 
the vessel wa s alongside  Number One Wharf  improved the reaction time  of the crew.  Once 
the seriousness of the  situation was recognised the crew ’s actions were timely and effective  
given the speed with which events unfolded .   
4.2.13.  Although the duty pilot  had passed on a message, through the port security guard, advising  
the vessel of the approaching southerly wind , the warning had failed to trigger any direct 
response from the port and effectively left the ship to its own devices.  This is discussed later 
in the report.  
4.3. Why did some of the shore bollards and mooring ropes fail? 
Forces exerted on the vessel ’s mooring ropes and shore bollards  
4.3.1.  An analysis of the mooring arrangement at the time of the accident21 examined the load s 
imparted on individual mooring ropes and shore bollards at a point in time when the wind had 
changed to the south and was gusting up to 45 knots.  The analysis assumed a pretension on 
the lines of 5 tonnes and the minimum breaking load reduced to 52 tonnes to allow for the 
bending of mooring ropes arou nd fairleads .  The results of the analysis at around the time of 
failure (see Table 5 ) show the approximate forces imparted o n bollards and ropes:

4.3.2.  Appendix 4 show s that at  about  the time shore  bollards  86, 87 and 26  failed, the mooring 
ropes had not reached their minimum breaking load  and were capable of absorbing 
considerably more load.  In respect of the four remaining intact stern lines , further analysis 
show ed that the load on each rope increased until there was a sequential failure  of the three 
longest lines.  The shortest stern line remained intact , but as the load increased it started 
surging on the mooring bitts .

 4.3.3.  Theoretically, after bollard 26 failed the remaining stern lines that were leading out from 
winches should have rendered22 before they broke.  At least one of these stern lines was seen 
to render, but eventually broke soon after.  
4.3.4.  Industry good  practice in respect of safe mooring practices can be found in the Oil Companies 
International Marine Forum (OCIMF) publication Mooring Equipment Guidelines (4th Edition).  
4.3.5.  The OCIMF publication explains that ‘t he primary brake secures the drum, and thus th e 
mooring line, at the shipboard end when the ship is moored.  The primary brake is designed to 
render before the loads become excessive to reduce the risk of mooring lines breaking ’.  New 
winch brakes are normally designed to hold about 80%, of the moorin g line minimum breaking 
load (MBL) .  In the case of Seabourn Encore  the winches were designed to support a static 
pull of 48 tonnes before rendering, which is 76% of the mooring lines minimum breaking load .  
4.3.6.  The OCIMF pu blication  advise s setting the brake  in service to hold 60 % of the mooring rope  
minimum braking load .  However , the International Standards Organisation (ISO) 3730 
recommends that  the brake holding capacity for new equipment should be initially left at 80% 
of the MBL .  The ISO re commendation  makes an allowance for wear and tear of the winch 
brake  in service and so it is recommended that new equipment be set up  to hold 80 % of the 
design MBL with a capability of adjusting the holding  load down to 60 % if required . 
4.3.7.  The Seab ourn  Encore ’s mooring systems were almost new, having only been commissioned to 
service three  months before the accident.  It could not be established with certainty what the 
winches were set to render at when commissioned, but it is about as likely as not that it wo uld 
have been at the 48 -tonnes maximum (76% of the mooring rope minimum breaking load).  
One explanation for why the mooring ropes broke, rather than the winch rendering is the 
typical reduction in the rope’s minimum breaking load caused by the change in d irection as 
the rope passes around mooring leads  and fairleads  at the ship’s side .  
Bollard securing arrangement  
4.3.8.  The Commission recovered three of the four bolts  that had been used to s ecure bollard  26, 
which  had recently undergone refurbishment  (Figure 9 ).  Two securing bolts  recovered  had 
been passed through the concrete section of the wharf, and the remaining one had been 
passed through the wooden fendering at the face of the wharf.   The bolts underwent 
metallurgical examination to identify the failure m ode and assess their suitability .23 
4.3.9.  The subsequent examination report concluded that:  
 the bolts failed in shear at the weld  between the head plate  and the bolt (Figure 1 0) 
 because of the d esign of the welded bolt head arrangement , it was estimated that the 
bolts had an effective strength of one-half to one -third  of a normal 32  mm-diameter bolt  
 a comparison to contempor ary bollard designs suggest ed that the use of only four such 
welded head plate bolts to fix bollards would result in signi ficantly diminished bollard 
capacity, well below the loading ap plied to the bollards on the day of the accident . 
4.3.10.  The bollard bolt heads failed as a result of shear overload in the weld between the bolt shank 
and the head plate.   The total shear area of all four bolts was 400 square millimetres,  which 
equates to about 27 tonnes force if the load was equally distributed under the bolt head.  If 
the loading was uneven the load could have been as low as 18 tonnes force.   As shown in  
Table 5 , any one of the two mooring ropes attached to bollard 26 would have likely exceeded 
the holding capability of bollard 26.  The two mooring ropes together caused a  total load on 
the bollard of approximately 60 tonnes,  meaning failure of the bollard  was virtually certain at 
the time of the weather event.

4.3.11.  The metallurgical analysis confirmed that the re was no significant loss of section due to 
corrosion, but that the shearing had occurred at the weld material , whic h had a total area of 
about half the cross -sectional area of the bolt shank.  The welded head had therefore become 
the weakest point in the securing arrangement  (Figure 10 ). 
4.3.12.  The mooring ropes had an elevation of approximately 30° to the horizontal and therefore had 
a vertical component creating an uneven distribution of load.  It is likely that the load s being 
applied to the bolt heads on bollard 26 were  not equal.  As a result,  it is likely that the 
shearing force required to cause failure w as less than that envisaged at design.

4.3.13.  A vessel the size of the Seabourn Encore  has a windage area24 of about 5 ,800 square  metres ,

 the accident  the loads generated by the wind on the ship and imparted by the mooring ropes 
exceeded the holding power of some shore bollards.  The reasons for this are  discussed 
below.  
4.3.14.  The design used for attaching the head s of the securing bolt s was a key component in 
providing strength to the bollar ds.  The method used to weld the head s of the bolt s to the 
shaft s effectively reduced the cross -sectional area s of the bo lts by at least 50% .  This 
introduced a weak point to the securing arrangement s.  Had the bolt head s been attached to 
withstand the same load as a 32  mm-diameter bolt , they would have failed at approximately 
57 tonnes force, nearly three times the apparent  failure load.  
4.3.15.  Another  factor was that some bollards were secured through decaying timber at the face of 
the wharf (Figure 11 ), which was the weakest point in the securing arrangement.  The load on 
the mooring ropes was transferred to the bollard securing bolts  that passed through the  
supporting timber structure .  The timber was unable to withstand the loads being applied and 
gave way, causing the bollard s to fail .   
4.3.16.  Another factor  was the inconsistency in how bollards were  secured.  There were a number of 
different bollard designs and securing methods in use.  No bollard contained the maximum 
possible number of securing bolts and the bolt head design for securing them was 
inconsistent  (Figure 12) .  As a consequence,  the bollards were not secured in a way co nsistent 
to achieve their designed safe working load , making it virtually impossible to establish a 
known safe working load for each .   
 
Figure 12 
Underutilisation of the bollard securing arrangement  
 
4.4. Integrity of the bollard securing arrangement  
Safety issue – The safe working loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown  and 
therefore  it was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe.    
Structural condition of the wharf  
4.4.1.  The 2016 enginee ring assessment of Number One Wharf, commissioned by PrimePort Timaru  
and carried out by Opus, identified deficiencies in the condition of the supporting timber 
structure .  As a result of the findings PrimePort Timaru  commenced a long -term, risk -based 
programme of re placing decaying timber.   
4.4.2.  The engineering assessment did not examine  bollards or the outer edge of the wharf , but as 
part of the work in progress for meeting the needs of cruise vessels PrimePort Timaru 
commenced a programme of installing s ome new bollards  (Figure 13)  and replacing some 
original bollard securing bolts.  
4.4.3.  The new bollards were  set further back from the face of the wharf and had a safe working load 
of 80 tonnes  stamped on the ir base s.  The replaced bollard securing bolts were of  the same 
design as those described earlier in this report.  


<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report MO-2017-204  
Figure 13 
Newly installed steel bollard  
4.4.4.  The lack of any historical records held by PrimePort Timaru  in respect of bollard design and 
securing arrangements meant that the safe working load s or capacity of the bollards were  
unknown.  The various bollard designs and securing methods meant that each bollard was 
likely to have its own safe working load.   
4.4.5.  There had never been a programme of work to load -test bollards and establish their safe 
working load s.  As part of the risk -based approach to the  restoration and repair work being 
undertaken it would have been appropriate for PrimePort Timaru to identify the safe working 
load or  capacity of each bollard , including the new bollards that had been  recently fitted.  
4.4.6.  Three of the Seabourn Encore ’s head  lines were each secured to one of the new bollards.  
Although the mooring analysis showed that the loads on these b ollards were  less than those 
at the stern , the bollards  were secured using the same type of securing bolt as bollard 26 .  
Given the earlier explanation of the bolts ’ failure it is highly likely that the new bollards as 
installed would not have met  their designed 80 -tonne capacity.  
4.4.7.  Som e large , modern types of vessel, such as passenger and container vessels, have large  
windage area s.  These vessels can impart significant forces on a wharf structure and mooring 
bollards when the ship s are  exposed to h igh winds from the direction of the wharf.  The overall 
force th at wind can impart on a ship  can be calculated , and from that the force  that the ship’s 
mooring lines impart on the wharf bollards can be calculated.  These calculations can then be 
compared to the safe working load s of the mooring bollards (if known) to which the mooring 
lines are attached . 
4.4.8.  Only when these parameters have been established can it be determined whether a berth is 
suitable for a vessel  to lie safely alongside.  Such parameters  help to identify operational limits 
and provide guidance as to what additional control measures may be required  for different 
environmental conditions .  
4.4.9.  Although PrimePort Timaru had tried to mitigate some anticipated risks of berthing cruise 
vessels, the  arrival of  the Seabourn Encore  for the first time at Number One Wharf should 
have prompted both the port and the ship o perator  to satisfy themselves that the allocated 
berth and the planned mooring arrangement were  fit for purpose .   
4.4.10.  Other Seabourn  Cruise  Line vessels had visited Timaru previously , but this was the Seabourn 
Encore ’s first visit.  On this occasion the company had relied on its appointed commercial 
agent to determine berth suitability. However, the agent ’s assessment had primarily focused 
on the commercial activities of the vessel during its stay in Timaru.  

Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 23 >>
 4.4.11.  Regarding  berth suitability , the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code , a voluntary 
national standard,  advises a  port operator in part to :   
ensure that all w harves, including structures, decking, berthing facilities and bollards 
are suita ble for the ships that use them .   
Notwithstanding t he need for a port operator to ensure that a wharf is suitable , there is also a 
need f or ship operators to  establish with t he port operator the suitability of the wharf,  
preferably through an  exchange of information prior to the ship visit .   
4.4.12.  The most recent document identif ying risks within the harbour a t the time of the accident  was 
the 2015 Timaru  pilotage area risk assessment . Prepared in accordance with the New 
Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code , the assessment identified seven risks having 
significant consequences requiring further scrutiny and attention to mitigations and controls.  
Pertinent to this accident  the risks included wind and wind gusts, vessel mooring line parting 
and bollard/wharf structural failure.  
4.4.13.  In relation to these three risks the assessment made reference to the 2015 accident  involving 
the E.R. New York  breaking away  from the North Mole , an accident  after  which the port had 
made  several recommendations .  Had all of the  recommendations  from the 2015 accident  
been implemented throughout the port,  including Number One Wharf, it is likely that this 
accident could have bee n avoided.  Unfortunately , some measures were still being reviewed 
and others were only considered relevant to the North Mole.  
4.4.14.  The steady growth in the number of vessels with large windage area s visiting New Zealand has 
predominantly reflected growth in  the cruise and container sectors .  Port operators  have to be 
cognisant  of the fact  that some  New Zealand ports were never designed and constructed to 
accept vessels  capable of imparting considerable loads on wharves and bollards .   
4.4.15.  Notwithstanding the advice contained in the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety 
Code , port operators should also  consider the integrity of the ir port infrastructure in relation to 
the types of load that can be expected when vessels with large windage are as are  exposed to 
strong winds.  
4.4.16.  To ensure that all New Zealand port operators are aware of the potential implications of 
securing vessels with large windage area s in their ports , the Commission has made a 
recommendation to the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand to promulgate through the 
Secretariat of the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code Steering Group the findings of this 
report , in particular the potential dangers associated with securing vessels that may be 
capable of generating loads in excess of those that  the infrastructure can withstand .   
4.4.17.  Whilst the risks had been identified and kept under review , they had not been made ‘as low as 
reasonably practicable ’ for the Seabourn Encore  alongside Number One Wharf.  Previous  
lessons learnt had not been implemented  and therefore the control measures in place at the 
time of the accident we re not effective.   
4.4.18.  The Commission would have made a recommendation to PrimePort Timaru to undertake a 
thorough assessment of the port’s mooring capabilit ies to establish the suitab ility of wharf 
structures and bollard securing arrangements for vessels approved to enter the port.  Part of 
that assessment would have been to determine the maximum loading capacity of all bollards 
within the port and their suitability in respect of the g uidance laid out in the Code of Practice 
for Design of Fendering and Mooring Systems.  However, this work is currently underway and 
is detailed in section 7 of this report.  
4.4.19.  Until this programme of work is complete the Commission has made a r ecommend ation to 
PrimePort Timaru  to undertake a type -specific ship -to-berth risk assessment for all vessels 
visiting the port .  The assessment should confirm that allocated berth s are safe for the 
vessel s, define any operational limits  or restrictions , and identify any  additional control 
measures that may be required.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 4.5. Adherence to  the port’s procedures  for mooring and high wind warning s 
Safety issue  – The mooring procedures contained in the port  company’s  SMS  were not strictly adhered 
to and the procedure in the event o f a high wind warning was ineffective.  
4.5.1.  Mooring procedures contained in the port’s Quality System Document had been updated to 
reflect lessons learnt from the breakaway of E.R. New York  from the North Mole. The risk of a 
vessel breaking away from its berth  had been considered and two key procedures had been 
developed as an outcome : high wind warning and advice on moorings.    
4.5.2.  In the event of a high wind warning , the procedure in part required : 
 the marine manager and/or duty pilot to check the local weather forecast  
 when winds in excess of 35 knots were  forecast , the marine manager or duty pilot to 
advise the ship’s agent to inform the vessel to put out extra moorings  
 a tug to be made ready for sea and placed on 10 minutes ’ notice .25  If a vessel require d 
assistance the tug  was to assist by pushing up alongside.  
4.5.3.  The above procedures only applied to vessels berthed at the North Mole.  A strong wind event 
is relative to the size of the vessel and where it is berthed.   Every vessel must be considered 
according  to its unique characteristics, which is why ship -specific parameters are essential so 
that any response  can be  measured and effective.  Likewise , a wind warning procedure must 
consider all berths and ensure that the response is appropriate.  
4.5.4.  On this occasion t he duty pilot was monitoring the weather information  and attempt ed to alert 
the master with advance warning of the predicted increase in wind strength .  However,  the 
ship’s staff did not act on the information or p ass on the message to the master .  Had they 
done so  the master would undoubtedly have been better placed to prepar e the ship for the 
worsening weather.   
4.5.5.  Although the ship could have been better prepared, on these sorts of occasion  it is likely that  a 
ship’s master will also need assista nce from the port .  The port ’s own response to the high 
wind warning was rudimentary and did not automatically trigger the type of support  and 
resources  the master  may have required , particularly if it had been decided  to run additional 
mooring lines (to the correct bollards) or if a pilot and /or tugs were  required at short notice .   
4.5.6.  There were two other o ption s for the duty pilot .  One would have been to inform the vessel’s 
commercial agent  in accordance with the instructions contained in  the high wind wa rning 
procedure for the North Mole , and the second would have been to contact the vessel directly 
and discuss with the master the implications of the new weather information and jointly agree 
what action needed to be taken.     
4.5.7.  Had the master  and the pilot discussed the situation  then  measures could have been taken  
earlier , including running  additional mooring lines , prepar ing propulsion systems, and order ing 
tugs.  Collectively these measures could have  reduc ed the weight on the mooring ropes and in 
turn the load o n the shore bollards.   It is feasible  that the reduction in load may have 
prevented the bollard  failure . 
4.5.8.  As part of the port’s risk control measures , shore bollards had been colour coded to identify 
those that  were suitable for use.  The mooring procedure required n o more than one mooring 
line to be placed over a bollard , and w here possible steel bollards were to be used in 
preference to timber bollards .  Any change in the procedure required approval fr om the duty 
pilot.     
4.5.9.  Although the mooring hands had been trained in the required mooring procedures , one stern 
line had been  place d over a timber bollard , and t wo stern lines had been  placed over steel

 bollard 26, a refurbished bollard used for servic ing cruise vessels.  It was a departure from the 
procedure and one that had not been approved by the duty pilot.   
4.5.10.  Placing two stern lines on bollard  26 significantly  increased the load and highly likely 
contributed to its failure .  Notwithstanding that, resu lts showed that had only one line been 
placed on bollard 26 the load being imparted by that one line could have been sufficient to 
cause failure anyway.  
4.5.11.  As previously discussed , there were similarities between this accident  and the  previous  2015 
accident .  Although control measures had been implemented and incorporated as a result  of 
the previous accident , this accident  shows that further work is still required .  A robust port 
response to a high wind event, the ability to promulgate  weather information effectively, and 
tan assessment of  each  ship and its mooring arrangement for a proposed berth  would 
improve the safety of vessels berthed at PrimePort  Timaru .

 Final Report MO-2017-204 5. Findings  
5.1. The Seabourn  Encore  broke away from its berth during a weather event . The breakaway was  
caused by  the progressive failure of the wharf mooring bollards  to which the ship’s  mooring 
lines were attached . 
5.2. The weather event could not have been  considered extreme or unusual for the port.  
5.3. The moori ng bollards failed because the unique method with which each  had been  fastened 
to the wharf and/or the strength of the underlying wharf structure meant they were  unable to 
withstand the forces imparted on them by the Seabourn  Encore ’s mooring lines.  
5.4. The mooring procedures for the port we re not strictly followed, which increased the 
vulnerability of the mooring arrangement.  
5.5. The Seabourn  Encore ’s mooring lines and associated equipment were in good condition and 
were not factor s contributing to the accident.  
5.6. Knowing the safe working load s of the various mooring bollards in a port is critical to safe ship 
operations.  The port company had virtually no  knowledge of the actual safe working loads of 
the various mooring bollards on the whar f.  
5.7. The documented port company response to a predicted weather event was not strictly 
followed, which resulted in neither the ship’s crew nor the port company resources being fully 
prepared to respond in a timely manner.  
5.8. The ship could have been better prepared for the weather event had the message  from the 
duty pilot been passed to the master.  However, the  prompt actions taken by the ship’s crew 
when the weather event occurred  very likely reduced the consequences of the accident.  
  
Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 27 >>
 6. Safety issues  
6.1. The safe working loads of the bollards on Number One  Wharf were unknown and therefore it 
was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe .  
6.2. The mooring procedures contained in the port’s SMS  were not strictly adhered to and the 
procedure in the event of a high wind warning was in effective.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 7.  Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  address ing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Since the accident PrimePort Timaru  has reported that : 
 it has been decided not to allow cruise liners to berth at Timaru in 2019  
 the mooring procedures  have been updated to include mooring plans for each class of 
vessel.   The policy of ‘one line one bollard’ has been reemphasised (and trained for) in 
that it is only permitted on explicit approval by the pilot in charge  
 additional training of moorings sta ff, particularly the Charge Hands (crew Foreman) on 
procedures for mooring  has been completed  
 remote wind sensors were investigated extensively.   MetService consultants conducted a 
site visit and we have determined that , generally , remote wind sensors were  not required , 
with the exception of a new wind sensor to be installed on the eastern breakwater  
 a new prediction model ‘Predict Wind ’ is now being used and MetService remote weather 
stations are monitored when “Predict wind flags strong winds likely”  
 high wind procedures have been updated in our pilotage procedure guide and PrimePort 
Timaru  emergency cards  
 shore bollards are currently being installed on the North Mole to protect container ships 
from prevailing norwest winds.   The capex cost  is approx. $150 k 
 shore bollards for the No1 wharf have been approved by the board and are going through 
the final engineering design.   These bollards are intended for use by cruise ships should 
there be any threat of high winds.   The capex cost is estimated at $600k and works are 
planned for completion by the 2019/20 cruise season  
 while underway  before the Seabourn accident , extensive bollard strengthening work 
continues around the port (as below report from our Infrastructure Manager):  
 completed a bollard condition inspe ction (including bolt systems ’ assessment) of all 
bollards on all wharves.   Inspection sheets have been completed for every bollard on 
each wharf  
 a jacket system has been introduced whereby Bollards identified as “NOT to be 
used” have a “DO NOT USE” jacket  installed over them  
 we have removed a few more decayed timber bollards ID through the Condition 
Inspection process  
 since June 2017:  
o 7 new 80T Bollards have been installed on N orth Mole 
o 3 new 80T Bollards have been installed on number one wharf  
o 3 new 80T Bollards have been installed on number one wharf X 
 20 new 80T Trelleborg Bollards are due to arrive in the next week or so to enable 
this program me to continue  
 the long-term plan is to ensure all bollards used by large bulk vessels and container 
vessel s: 
Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 29 >>
 o are of a known strength (e.g. 80 tonne  Trelleborg bollards).   Many of the 
existing steel bollards in the port have no recorded “load capacity or rating”  
o bollard bolts with welded heads are eliminated and replaced with 32mm 
(min) threaded rods  
o all Bollar d bolts are in place and “tight”  
o fastening systems are tied to the wharf in a consistent ( “engineered” 
manner  
o we have begun replacing all sub strength bollard systems using a risk 
approach to prioritise replacement.   The priority wharf is North Mole – most  
(if not all) of the regularly used bollards were replaced earlier this year.    
7.3. Holland America Group has  reported that : 
 an internal  investigation report on this accident was concluded in 2017  
 in future  at all New Zealand ports that are visited by our flee t, the ship’s agent is to obtain 
written confirmation from the port operator that the bollard capacity meets recognised 
industry standards and is suitable in all respects for a cruise ship of the size that is being 
booked.  The agent should request and hav e copies available of the test certificates 
confirming the SWL (safe working load) of bollards at the assigned berth(s)  
 when in port, any wind or weather advisory, or warning, that is received by the officer of 
the watch is to be entered in the ship’s log.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to  PrimePort Timaru and Maritime 
New Zealand.   
8.2. In the interests of transport saf ety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or accident s occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation  
To PrimePort Timaru   
8.3. The r esponsibility for the safety and security of a vessel moored  alongside a harbour wharf lies 
with both the vessel and the port operator.  Notwithstanding that joint responsibility it remains 
an important func tion of a port to ensure that the wharf structure and mooring system is 
adequate for any vessel that intends to use it .   
Section 7 of this report draws attention to the work that PrimePort Timaru is currently 
undertaking , and the work it is planning to un dertake,  to improve the condition and reliability 
of its wharves , associated mooring systems and mooring procedures.    
Until all of the improvement work has been completed , it is important that the port ensure s 
that the infrastructure  and procedures in place at any given time are suitable for any vessel 
intending to use the port.   
On 21 February 2019  the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of PrimePort 
Timaru that , until all the planned improvement work is completed, a ship-to-berth risk 
assessment be undertaken for all vessels intending to use the port.  The assessment should 
identify whether a  berth is safe for a vessel  to remain alongside , define any operational limits 
or restrictions  and identify any additional control me asures that may be required.   This 
information should be passed to the ship prior to arrival.   (003/19) 
On 8 March 2019, PrimePort Timaru replied:  
PrimePort Timaru can confirm that recommendation 003/19 has been fully 
implemented from February 2018.  
As TAIC will be aware, the Harbour Master is an appointee of the regional council, 
who is under a duty to ensure the maritime safety of ports in that region. The 
Harbour Master regularly makes extensive enquiries of the Port and is provided with 
the Port E ngineer's six­ monthly assessment of berths. The Harbour Master issues 
Directions from time to time which, for example, determine the operating 
requirements and limitations that apply to vessels using the Port and to the Port 
itself.  
Under these Directions , vessels must ask the Port for a berth at least 24 hours in 
advance. The Port must receive a declaration as to the particulars of the vessel. The 
Port will then determine if the Master holds the relevant Pilot Exemption Certificate 
(PEC) issued by Maritim e New Zealand under Part 90 of the Maritime Rules. A PEC 
will not normally be issued for any vessel above 120m LOA.  
Where a PEC is held, the vessel will be directed to a berth with prior approval for that 
vessel type from the Harbour Master under his power s contained in Part 3A of the 
Maritime Transport Act 1994. Monthly meetings are conducted with the 
Harbourmaster and Maritime New Zealand. Infrastructure is a topic on the agenda. 
The Harbour Master will have regard to prior use of the berth and the port e ngineer's 
assessment in determining the grant of approval.  
Final Re port MO -2017 -204 
<< Page 31 >>
  If a PEC is not held by the Master, then a Port Assessment will be jointly completed 
between the ship and the Port prior to arrival. Further pre -arrival information will also 
be passed onto the Ma ster via the vessel's shipping agents.  
The Port Assessment considers relevant factors such as wind conditions, the 
dimensions (LOA, draft) of the largest vessel to have called at the port, and the 
official restrictions of the Port and berths imposed by the  Harbour Master and 
navigation safety bylaws.  
Pilots work to a pilot procedure guide agreed by all the pilots, applying the Harbour 
Master's Directions and navigation safety bylaws. The guide details matters relevant 
to assessing risks such as standard moo ring guides for use at Timaru, high wind 
procedures for each wharf and operating criteria in different environmental 
conditions. Pilots must receive from Masters a 'Pilot Information Card' as set out in 
the pilots' pre -movement checklist. Pilots work with Masters using the mooring guide 
and passage plan to determine safe piloting of the vessel to an appropriate berth, 
with Masters having the final say as to the manner in which the vessel is made and 
declared fast.  
The Port will also respond to specific requ ests for information or audits from vessel 
operators such as Coastal Oil Logistics Ltd or cruise liners, using forms such as the 
Marine Terminal Criteria & Assessment Questionnaire. Audits cover matters such as 
jetty or berth structure, and the systems and  operations used.  
To the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand  
8.4. The port company should ensure that a berth allocated to a visiting vessel is suitable.  A 
prerequisite for achiev ing that is port companies having  an understanding of the loads 
capable of be ing generated by vessels with large windage areas and whether the port 
infrastructure is capable of withstanding them.  
On 21 February 2019  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of Maritime 
New Zealand promulgate, through the Secretariat of t he Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code 
Steering Group, the findings of this report , in particular the potential dangers associated with 
securing vessels that may  be capable of generating loads in excess of those that  the port 
infrastructure can withstand .  Port companies should have a thorough appreciation of the 
loads involved for various ship types as well as the load limitations of the  port infrastructure.   
(004/19) 
On 8 March 2019, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
The Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code Steering Group is a partnership between 
Maritime NZ, regional councils and port companies. Its primary responsibility is to 
implement the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code. Maritime NZ will 
work with the Secretariat of the Steering Group to p romulgate the findings of the 
report in that context.  
As noted in my letter to the Commission on 6 December 2018 I agree that the issues 
highlighted in this report will be of importance to port companies and consider that a 
direct promulgation of these iss ues to port companies would also be appropriate in 
the circumstances. Accordingly, we will also engage directly with port companies and 
those who work on the ports through their associations and representatives. This will 
enable Maritime NZ as the regulato r to make its expectations clear as to the actions 
that port companies should be taking as a result of the findings and ensure that they 
comply with their maritime safety obligations.  
I believe that WorkSafe New Zealand will also have an interest in the fi ndings of the 
final report. Maritime NZ and WorkSafe are co -regulators for health and safety 
matters in port operations, and we work closely together on all port safety matters. 
We will share these findings with Worksafe.  
Once the Commission has released t he final report we will undertake the actions 
described above. I will advise you after this has been done.

 Final Report MO-2017-204 9. Key l essons  
9.1. Port companies must be aware of the safe working load s of their mooring infrastructure in 
order to produce safe and effective ship moori ng plans.  
9.2. Procedures for monitoring and communicating weather conditions must be robust and strictly 
followed when harbouring ships that are prone to high winds.
