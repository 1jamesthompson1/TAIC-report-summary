- name: Mooring Equipment Integrity
  explanation: The integrity of mooring equipment, specifically the bollards, was a critical factor in the Seabourn Encore accident. The bollards failed to withstand the forces imparted on them by the ship's mooring lines during the weather event, leading to the vessel breaking away from its berth. The report states that "the mooring bollards failed because the unique method with which each had been fastened to the wharf and/or the strength of the underlying wharf structure meant they were unable to withstand the forces" (5.3). Additionally, the bollards were not secured in a way consistent to achieve their designed safe working load, making it virtually impossible to establish a known safe working load for each (4.3.16).
- name: Mooring Procedures Adherence
  explanation: The adherence to mooring procedures is another safety theme highlighted by the accident. The port's mooring procedures were not strictly followed, which increased the vulnerability of the mooring arrangement. For instance, "one stern line had been placed over a timber bollard, and two stern lines had been placed over steel bollard 26, a refurbished bollard used for servicing cruise vessels" without approval from the duty pilot, which was a departure from the procedure (4.5.9). This non-adherence to procedures contributed to the failure of the mooring bollards.
- name: Weather Preparedness and Response
  explanation: Weather preparedness and response is a significant safety theme in this accident. The port company's documented response to a predicted weather event was not strictly followed, resulting in neither the ship's crew nor the port company resources being fully prepared to respond in a timely manner (5.7). The report also notes that the duty pilot attempted to alert the master with advance warning of the predicted increase in wind strength, but the ship's staff did not act on the information (4.5.4). This lack of effective response to weather warnings increased the risk of the accident.
- name: Knowledge of Safe Working Loads
  explanation: Knowing the safe working loads of mooring bollards is crucial for safe ship operations, and the lack of this knowledge is a safety theme related to the accident. The port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual safe working loads of the various mooring bollards on the wharf (5.6). The report emphasizes that "the safe working loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown and therefore it was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe" (4.4).
- name: Structural Condition of the Wharf
  explanation: The structural condition of the wharf is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The engineering assessment of Number One Wharf identified deficiencies in the condition of the supporting timber structure, which led to a program of replacing decaying timber (4.4.1). However, the assessment did not examine bollards or the outer edge of the wharf (4.4.2). The failure of the bollards due to the underlying structure's inability to withstand the loads highlights the importance of the wharf's structural integrity.
- name: Effective Communication of Weather Information
  explanation: Effective communication of weather information is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The report indicates that the duty pilot passed on a message advising the vessel of the approaching southerly wind, but the warning failed to trigger any direct response from the port and effectively left the ship to its own devices (4.2.13). The lack of effective communication and response to the high wind warning contributed to the ship not being adequately prepared for the weather event.
