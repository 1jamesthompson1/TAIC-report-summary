","0.0","0.0","The report does not provide evidence that human error and assumptions directly contributed to the accident. There is no mention of individuals making incorrect judgments based on incomplete information or relying on expected actions of others without verification.
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the report to suggest that a lack of training and competency among the personnel directly contributed to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report states that ""all the mooring ropes were in good condition"" (4.2.2), indicating that the crew was familiar with the equipment and its condition was not a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not indicate that the crew's resource management was a factor in the accident. It does not mention any issues with teamwork, communication, decision-making, or leadership skills.
","0.0","28.333","The report indicates that ""the mooring procedures for the port were not strictly followed, which increased the vulnerability of the mooring arrangement"" (5.4). Additionally, ""one stern line had been placed over a timber bollard, and two stern lines had been placed over steel bollard 26, a refurbished bollard used for servicing cruise vessels. It was a departure from the procedure and one that had not been approved by the duty pilot"" (4.5.9). This lack of adherence to established safety procedures significantly contributed to the accident.
","2.887","15.0","The port's organizational safety culture was called into question as the report states that ""previous lessons learnt had not been implemented and therefore the control measures in place at the time of the accident were not effective"" (4.4.17). This suggests that the organizational culture did not adequately prioritize the implementation of safety measures derived from past incidents.
","5.0","16.667","The report highlights that the loads generated by the wind on the ship exceeded the holding power of some shore bollards, and ""the reasons for this are discussed below"" (4.3.13), indicating a failure in risk management and analysis. Furthermore, ""the risks had been identified and kept under review, they had not been made 'as low as reasonably practicable'"" (4.4.17), showing that the risk management processes were not effectively applied.
","2.887","3.333","The report does not directly attribute the cause of the accident to a lack of regulatory oversight and compliance. However, it does mention the importance of compliance with the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code (4.4.11), suggesting that better regulatory oversight might have prevented the accident.
","2.887","0.0","The report does not suggest that a loss of situational awareness was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not indicate that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the accident. The crew's response to the weather event was described as ""timely and effective"" (4.2.12).
","0.0","18.333","The failure of the mooring bollards was due to ""the unique method with which each had been fastened to the wharf and/or the strength of the underlying wharf structure"" (5.3). The report also mentions that ""the port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual safe working loads of the various mooring bollards on the wharf"" (5.6), indicating a lack of proper maintenance and inspection regimes.
","7.638","0.0","The use of automation is not mentioned as a contributing factor in the report. There is no evidence to suggest that over-reliance on automated systems without proper understanding or monitoring led to the accident.
","0.0","10.0","Weather conditions played a role in the accident as the wind speed gusting to 45 knots contributed to the failure of the bollards (4.2.5). The decision-making process in response to the weather conditions was also flawed, as ""the ship could have been better prepared for the weather event had the message from the duty pilot been passed to the master"" (5.8).
","0.0","8.333","There was a communication breakdown as ""the duty pilot had passed on a message, through the port security guard, advising the vessel of the approaching southerly wind, the warning had failed to trigger any direct response from the port and effectively left the ship to its own devices"" (4.2.13). This breakdown in communication contributed to the lack of preparedness for the weather event.
","2.887","0.0","There are no additional safety themes identified in the report that contributed to the accident outside of the predefined themes.","0.0","true","N/A"
