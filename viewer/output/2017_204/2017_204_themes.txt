Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Insufficient preparation for adverse weather conditions: The report highlights that the Seabourn Encore could have been better prepared for the weather event if the message from the pilot had reached the master. This lack of preparation increased the risk of harm to people and damage to property and the environment.

2. Failure of mooring equipment: The mooring ropes and shore bollards failed under the increased load caused by the wind. The report identifies issues with the safe working loads of the bollards and the design of the securing bolts, which contributed to their failure.

3. Ineffective adherence to mooring procedures: The report states that the mooring procedures contained in the port's SMS were not strictly adhered to. This lack of adherence, including placing two stern lines on a single bollard, increased the load on the bollard and likely contributed to its failure.

4. Lack of knowledge about safe working loads: The report highlights that the port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual safe working loads of the mooring bollards on the wharf. This lack of knowledge made it impossible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe.

5. Inadequate response to high wind warning: The port's response to the high wind warning was rudimentary and did not automatically trigger the necessary support and resources for the vessel. The report suggests that a more robust port response and effective promulgation of weather information could have improved the safety of vessels berthed at the port.

6. Failure to implement previous recommendations: The report notes that there were similarities between this accident and a previous accident in 2015. Despite control measures being implemented as a result of the previous accident, further work was still required to improve safety. This highlights a failure to fully implement previous recommendations and lessons learned.
