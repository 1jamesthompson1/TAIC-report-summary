2017_204,004/19,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand promulgate, through the Secretariat of the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code Steering Group, the findings of this report, in particular the potential dangers associated with securing vessels that may be capable of generating loads in excess of those that the port infrastructure can withstand. Port companies should have a thorough appreciation of the loads involved for various ship types as well as the load limitations of the port infrastructure.","The port company should ensure that a berth allocated to a visiting vessel is suitable. A prerequisite for achieving that is port companies having an understanding of the loads capable of being generated by vessels with large windage areas and whether the port infrastructure is capable of withstanding them.

2017_204,003/19,"the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of PrimePort Timaru that, until all the planned improvement work is completed, a ship-to-berth risk assessment be undertaken for all vessels intending to use the port. The assessment should identify whether a berth is safe for a vessel to remain alongside, define any operational limits or restrictions and identify any additional control measures that may be required. This information should be passed to the ship prior to arrival.","The responsibility for the safety and security of a vessel moored alongside a harbour wharf lies with both the vessel and the port operator. Notwithstanding that joint responsibility it remains an important function of a port to ensure that the wharf structure and mooring system is adequate for any vessel that intends to use it.

Section 7 of this report draws attention to the work that PrimePort Timaru is currently undertaking, and the work it is planning to undertake, to improve the condition and reliability of its wharves, associated mooring systems and mooring procedures.

Until all of the improvement work has been completed, it is important that the port ensures that the infrastructure and procedures in place at any given time are suitable for any vessel intending to use the port.
