","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document that distracted operation was a factor in the accident.
","0.0","13.333","Human error played a role in the accident, as the staff involved in the loading and securing of the wagon body did not comply with the Freight Handling Code due to a lack of knowledge and training. The error management systems in place were insufficient to detect and mitigate these errors before they led to the accident (4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.10).
","5.774","23.333","The organizational culture and influences at KiwiRail did not ensure that safety was a priority, as evidenced by the lack of regular formal safety observations of container terminal operators and the absence of a requirement for staff to be trained in the Freight Handling Code (4.3.3). This contributed to the accident by allowing the load to be improperly secured and transported, ultimately leading to the collision (5.4).
","2.887","6.667","There was a breakdown in communication and resource management, as the container terminal operator in Dunedin assumed that the lashing method used when the load entered the yard was sufficient for its departure, and this incorrect method was not communicated or corrected by the rail operators during pre-departure inspections (4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.3.9).
","2.887","30.0","The accident was significantly influenced by the lack of training and preparedness of KiwiRail staff. The staff responsible for loading, securing, and inspecting the wagons were not sufficiently trained in the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, which led to the load not being secured in accordance with the code (4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.10, 4.3.12). This lack of training directly contributed to the accident, as the load shifted outside the standard loading gauge and struck several track-side structures and another train (5.1).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not discuss emergency response planning and coordination as a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","10.0","The MDD class special-movement wagon used to transport the load was not furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment, such as bond chains and edge protectors, which are part of the necessary maintenance and compliance procedures (4.4.2, 4.4.3). This lack of equipment made it impossible for staff to secure the load in compliance with the Freight Handling Code, even if they had been properly trained (5.5).
","8.66","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems were not relevant to the cause of the accident as described in the document.
","0.0","6.667","KiwiRail's compliance with safety management practices was inadequate, as the staff were not trained in the Freight Handling Code, which is a regulatory requirement for securing loads. This lack of compliance contributed to the improper securing of the load and the subsequent accident (4.3.2, 4.3.3).
","2.887","10.0","The design and specifications of the equipment, specifically the special-movement wagon, were not adequate for the task of securing the load. The wagon lacked the necessary chain boxes and winches, and bond chains were not available at the container terminal, which contributed to the inability to secure the load properly (4.4.2, 4.4.3).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not indicate that risk assessment and management practices, or the lack thereof, were a contributing factor to the accident.
