  \  Load security on wagon s is critically important.  The safety of the rail network\
  \ relies on trains \nbeing within  the \"loading gauge \".  The l oading gauge defines\
  \  the maximum dimensions to \nwhich a rail vehicle can be built or loaded without\
  \ risk of striking a structure  beside the track, \nincluding tunnel walls .  The\
  \ risk is heightened when there is an adjacent track, such as in \ndouble -line\
  \ territory, or in this case  where there was a crossing loop to enable opposing\
  \ trains \nto pass each other . \n4.1.2.  This accident was a good example of what\
  \ can happen if a load shifts outside the loading \ngauge.  Several track -side\
  \ structures were substantially damaged and eventually the displaced \nload struck\
  \ an opposing train waiting in a crossing  loop.  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis\
  \ discusses why the load shifted.  It also considers  2 safety issues:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ KiwiRail staff members who were responsible for loading and  securing wagons and\
  \ \ninspecting specia l loads were not sufficiently trained in and knowledgeable\
  \ about  the \nKiwiRail Freight  Handling Code.  \n\uF0B7 the special -movement\
  \ wagon was not well equipped to secure properly the special load \nit was designed\
  \ to convey . \n4.2. Why the load shifted  \n4.2.1.  The weight of the load was\
  \ calculated to be 9.5 tonnes.  When conveying unrestrained loads, \nthe Freight\
  \ Handling Code  required the combined rated strength of the lashings to be at least\
  \ \ntwice the weight of the load5.  The standard railway lashing chain (bond chain)\
  \ used by \nKiwiRail had a rated strength of 10 tonnes.  If these had been used,\
  \ a minimum of 2 chains \nwould have been required to lash the wagon body to the\
  \ special -movement wagon . \n4.2.2.  When wagon bodies were  transported on wagons,\
  \ the \"load\" was regarded by KiwiRail  as a \nsteel structure.  There were  no\
  \ specific rules for transporting these steel structures , but there \nwas sufficient\
  \ guidance on the  securing of steel products that could and should have been \n\
  applied to this load6. \n4.2.3.  KiwiRail 's standard loading instruction s were\
  \  to use bond chains for securing steel products \nsuch as  rolled product s, hollow\
  \ sections, steel coil s, wrapped steel sheets , light and heavy \nplate, coloursteel\
  \  and s teel slabs.   Bond chains fitted in the appropriate way would have been\
  \ \na better choic e for securing the load. \n4.2.4.  The Freight Handling Code\
  \  did allow w ebbing strops to be used to secure loads , but they had \nto be used\
  \ togeth er with edge protectors positioned between the webbing strops and where\
  \ \nthey pass ed around sharp parts of the steel structure to prevent the strops\
  \ fraying.  Fraying \nsignificantly reduces the strength of webbing strops.  \n\
  4.2.5.  The webbing strops used to secure the load to the wagon  had been  manufactured\
  \ in \naccordance with standard AS/NZS 4380:2001 .  They had a rated lash ing capacity\
  \ of 2.5 \ntonnes.  Therefore, a minimum of 8 webbing strops with edge protectors\
  \ would have been \nrequired to lash the wagon body in order to meet the Code  requirements\
  \ . \n4.2.6.  Only 4 webbing strops were used w hen the wagon body was first lashed\
  \ to a sta ndard flat -\ndeck wagon for the trip from the derailment site to Dunedin.\
  \  N one of those was fitted  with \nedge protectors.  When the load was transferred\
  \ to the special -movement wagon  at Dunedin , \nthe container terminal operator\
  \ simply transferred the lashing arrangement to the wagon.  \n                 \
  \                                       \n5 KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, Section\
  \ 5.7.  \n6 KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, Section 5 Load Security and  Safety,\
  \ Section 13 Metallic Products, and \nSection 13A Steel Products.  \n  \nFinal Report\
  \ 12 -101 \n<< Page 9 >>\n 4.2.7.  Unsurprisingly, the webbing strops had begun\
  \  to fray and the load had shifted by the time the \ntrain arrived in Timaru. \
  \ The container terminal operator there had the initiative to replace 2 \nfrayed\
  \ webbing strops and add one to mak e 5, but this was still 3 short of what was\
  \ required, \nand still edge protectors were not put in place to prevent them fraying\
  \ . \n4.2.8.  It was not possible to determine when and in what order the webbing\
  \ strops failed, but from \nthe time the first failed the others would have failed\
  \ in rapid succession as they progressively \nhad to cope with more and more of\
  \ the load.  \n4.2.9.  In those final kilometres before striking the stationary\
  \ train at Rolleston , the load appear ed to \nhave been almost, if not totally,\
  \ unrestrained.  First  it struck several structures on the east \nside of the train.\
  \  Then it struck the stationary train standing on the west side of the train, and\
  \ \nafter striking the stationary train it was found overhanging on the east side\
  \ again, with no \nlashings left securin g it. \nFindings  \n \n1. The load shifted\
  \ outside the standard loading gauge , and struck several track -side \nstructures\
  \ and another train, because it had not been secured in accordance with \nthe KiwiRail\
  \ Freight Handling Code  \n \n2. Only half the required number of webbing strops\
  \ had been used to secure the load  \nand none had edge protectors fitted to prevent\
  \ them fraying  \n \n3. The use of chains would have been a more appropriate method\
  \ of securing the \nload to the wagon  \n \n4.3. Training  \nSafety issue  - No-one\
  \ involved with loading, shifting and securing the wagon body was  sufficiently\
  \  \nfamiliar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code  to reali se that the securing\
  \ arrangement was not \ncompliant with the Code . \n4.3.1.  The Freight Handling\
  \ Code  was an integral component of KiwiRail's safety management \nsystem.  It\
  \ had been introduced in 1997.  The Code  was comprehensive and presented in a \n\
  pictorial format so that it could  be readily understood by those who need ed to\
  \ learn and \nadhere to it.  It was accessible from KiwiRail's  website.  \n4.3.2.\
  \  However, such a code is only useful if staff members who are required to follow\
  \ it are trained \naccordingly and have ready access to it.  In this case the persons\
  \ involved in clearing the \nderailment site were not trained in the Freight Handling\
  \ Co de.  Consequently the load was not \ncompliant with the Code  when it began\
  \ its journey .  \n4.3.3.  The container terminal operator at Dunedin had not been\
  \ trained or assessed against the \nCode  either .  His job description stated in\
  \ part:  \nAs a Container Terminal Operato r your primary task is the loading and\
  \ unloading \nof trucks and rail wagons.  You will carry out your role according\
  \  to KiwiRail's \nhealth and safety and rail operating procedures as specified\
  \ in the rail operating \ncode . \nThe bulk o f a container terminal oper ator's\
  \ work was loading and unloading containers \nbetween trucks and trains.  However,\
  \ they were  occasionally required to handle other types of \nfreight as well ,\
  \ so they should have been trained in the Freight Handling Code before being  \n\
  allowed to undertake those  tasks.  So too should  their  knowledge and currency\
  \ with the Code  \nhave been  routinely assessed.  However, in contrast to its requirements\
  \ for  other yard -\noperating staff, KiwiRail had no requirement to conduct regular\
  \ formal safety observations of \ncontainer terminal operators.  This knowledge\
  \ gap among  staff authorised to conduct these  \nimportant tasks is a safety issue\
  \ that will need to be addressed by KiwiRail.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report\
  \ 12 -101 4.3.4.  In the absence of any information to the contrary, t he Dunedin\
  \ container terminal operator \nmade an assumption that the method used to lash\
  \ the load when it entered the yard should \nbe sufficient for when it left the\
  \ yard.   Consequently the wagon  resumed its journey  still as a \nnon-compliant\
  \ load. \n4.3.5.  The next point in the journey when the error shou ld have been\
  \ picked up was during the rail \noperator's pre -departure train inspection at\
  \ the Dunedin freight terminal.   Rail operators were  \ntrained in and supposed\
  \ to be familiar with the KiwiRail Freight  Handling Code. \n4.3.6.  KiwiRail's\
  \ Rail Operating Code7 set out the duties and responsibilities of personnel  carrying\
  \ \nout train inspections.  It stated  in part:  \n6.1 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\
  \   \nWhere there are no explicit instructions Rail Pers onnel must exercise their\
  \ \nown judgement, subject to the overriding consideration that no train may \n\
  be dispatched if any vehicle in it is not in a safe condition to run.  \nThe thorough\
  \ walk around  of trains is essential for service quality and safe \noperations.\
  \  \n4.3.7.  During the walk -around on both sides of a train the rail operator\
  \  performing the train \ninspection was required to carry out a brake test, and\
  \ check the security and condition of each \nwagon , which include d checking :\
  \ \n\uF0B7 the condition of brake blocks  \n\uF0B7 for leaking hoses  \n\uF0B7 that\
  \ all wagons were  coupled correctly  \n\uF0B7 that all handbrakes had been  released\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the condition of wheels and springs  \n\uF0B7 that there was no hanging\
  \ brake equipment . \n4.3.8.  They were  also supposed to carry out a  load security\
  \ check to ensure  that:   \n\uF0B7 the loa ds were  secure as far as visible  \n\
  \uF0B7 bond chains were  secured and tight  \n\uF0B7 curtains/doors were  closed\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the twist -locks were  engaged and locked  \n\uF0B7 no loose [items]\
  \  such as tyres and timber were  present . \n4.3.9.  The pre -departure train inspection\
  \ was the final  opportunity to identify \"out-of-Code \" loads.  In \nthis case\
  \ neither the rail operator at Dunedin nor the one at Timaru identif ied that the\
  \ load \nhad not been secured in compliance with the Code .  The majority of rail\
  \ freight was container \ntraffic and regular bulk product s, with less special\
  \ general cargo freight being conveyed.  For \nthis reason it is possible that pre-departure\
  \ checks tend ed to focus on train running gear and \nassociated brake equipment,\
  \ all of which were  below the level of the wagon deck s, at the \nexpense o f conducting\
  \ proper assessment s of special load s such as the wagon body.  At a \ncursory\
  \ glance the wagon body would have looked reasonably well secured - not overhanging\
  \ \nand all 4 lashings tight .  It would have taken some knowledge of the Freight\
  \ Handling Code, or \nreference to it , to have understood that the load was not\
  \ properly secured.  \n4.3.10.  The same safety issue arose in Timaru.   The container\
  \ terminal operator at the depot had not \nbeen trained in the Freight Handling\
  \ Code .  Like the Dunedin container terminal  operator, he \nlashed the load in\
  \ a similar way, although in his case it should have been more obvious that \n \
  \                                                       \n7 KiwiRail  Rail Operating\
  \ Code , Section 5.3, Clause 6.1.  \n  \nFinal Report 12 -101 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\
  \ the lashing arrangement was not sui table  because he found 2 webbing strops frayed\
  \ , and \nreplaced them.  \n4.3.11.  The issue was not new to KiwiRail.  An internal\
  \ investigation had been  carried out in August \n2008 , following 3 separate consignments\
  \ of steel beams conveyed on flat-deck wagons \nshifting while in transit .  The\
  \ findings from the investigation had  identified the training  in, \nknowledge\
  \ of and appl ication of the Freight Handling Code  as contributory factors.  \n\
  4.3.12.  KiwiRail had a responsibility to ensure that staff was trained and competent\
  \ in all tasks being \nundertaken.  It had to  ensure that the loading and stowage\
  \ of goods on railway wagons were  \ncarried  out by people with the appropriate\
  \ training and certification.  \n4.4. The MDD class special -movement wagon  \n\
  Safety issue  - The MDD class special -movement wagon allocated to transport the\
  \ load from Dunedin to \nChristchurch had not been furnished  with the appropriate\
  \ load -securing equipment .  \n4.4.1.  The special -movement wagon had been converted\
  \ and allocated to KiwiRail's mechanical \ngroup for non -revenue, special -movement\
  \ use.  Th e wagon was more than 4 metres longer \nthan the standard UK -class flat-deck\
  \ wagon and ran on smaller -diameter wheels in order to \nlower the deck height\
  \ and make it  capable of carry ing high loads.  The wagons had initially \nbeen\
  \ used to transport passenger carriage bodies from Wellington to Dunedin.  \n4.4.2.\
  \  Wagon MDD43 had 3 chain boxes and winches  on each side.  However, when the wagon\
  \ was \nplaced in the container terminal at Dunedin there were no bond chains in\
  \ those boxes.   Bond \nchains and edge protectors were not kept at the container\
  \ terminal.  \n4.4.3.  A supply of the right equipment for a task is  important.\
  \  If it is not readily available , employees \nare less likely to go out of their\
  \ way to find and use it.  \n4.4.4.  On 12 July 20 13 KiwiRail advised that since\
  \ this incident the fleet of MDD class wagons ha d \nincreased from 3 to 4 and another\
  \ conversion was i n progress.  All of the special -movement \nwagons were fully\
  \ decked, had 8 stanchion pockets on each side and were fitted with 6 chain \nbox\
  \ assemblies, 6 corresponding chain winch arrangements and lengths of 10 -millimetre\
  \ \nGrade 80 chain.   This addressed this safety issue, so the Commission has not\
  \ made any  \nrecommendation.  \nFinding s  \n4. None of KiwiRail's staff  involved\
  \ with loading and securing the load was \nsufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail\
  \ Freight Handling Code  to reali se that the \nsecuring arrangement was not compliant\
  \ with the Code  \n \n5. The MDD class special -movement wagon allocated to transport\
  \ the load from \nDunedin to Christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate\
  \ load -\nsecuring equipment.  Consequently, if someo ne had wanted to secure the\
  \ load in \ncompliance with the Freight Handling Code , they would not have been\
  \ able to do \nso \n \n \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>"
