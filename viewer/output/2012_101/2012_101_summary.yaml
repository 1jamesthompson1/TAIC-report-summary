- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Human error and assumptions played a significant role in the accident. The report indicates that the container terminal operator at Dunedin "made an assumption that the method used to lash the load when it entered the yard should be sufficient for when it left the yard" (4.3.4). Additionally, the rail operators during pre-departure inspections did not identify the non-compliance with the Freight Handling Code, possibly due to a focus on train running gear rather than load security (4.3.9).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The lack of training and competency among KiwiRail staff was a significant factor. The report states that "No-one involved with loading, shifting and securing the wagon body was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code" (4.3), and that the staff involved in clearing the derailment site, the container terminal operator at Dunedin, and the rail operators were not trained in the Freight Handling Code (4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
