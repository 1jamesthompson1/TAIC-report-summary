- name: Load Securing Practices
  explanation: Load securing practices are a critical safety theme in this accident, as the load was not secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, leading to it shifting outside the standard loading gauge. The report states that "the load shifted outside the standard loading gauge, and struck several track-side structures and another train, because it had not been secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code" (5.1). Furthermore, "only half the required number of webbing strops had been used to secure the load and none had edge protectors fitted to prevent them fraying" (5.2), which indicates a failure to properly secure the load as per the established safety guidelines.
- name: Equipment Availability
  explanation: Equipment availability is another safety theme related to this accident. The MDD class special-movement wagon used to transport the load lacked the appropriate load-securing equipment, which would have been necessary to secure the load in compliance with the Freight Handling Code. The report finds that "the mdd class special-movement wagon allocated to transport the load from dunedin to christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of proper equipment contributed to the inability to secure the load safely.
- name: Staff Training and Familiarity with Safety Codes
  explanation: Staff training and familiarity with safety codes are central to this accident, as none of the KiwiRail staff involved with loading and securing the load were sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code. The report highlights this issue, stating "None of KiwiRail's staff involved with loading and securing the load was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code" (5.4). This lack of knowledge and training among the staff directly impacted the safety of the load securing process.
- name: Pre-Departure Inspection Procedures
  explanation: Pre-departure inspection procedures are a relevant safety theme because the report indicates that the pre-departure train inspections failed to identify the non-compliance of the load securing with the Freight Handling Code. The report notes that "the pre-departure train inspection was the final opportunity to identify 'out-of-Code' loads" (4.3.9), yet neither the rail operator at Dunedin nor the one at Timaru identified the issue. This suggests that the inspection procedures were either inadequate or not properly followed.
- name: Safety Management System Effectiveness
  explanation: The effectiveness of the safety management system is a safety theme in this accident, as the Freight Handling Code was part of KiwiRail's safety management system but was not effectively implemented or followed. The report states that "The Freight Handling Code was an integral component of KiwiRail's safety management system" (4.3.1), yet the staff were not trained accordingly, and the load was not compliant with the Code when it began its journey (4.3.2). This points to a systemic issue in the safety management practices of the organization.
- name: Organizational Oversight and Regular Safety Assessments
  explanation: Organizational oversight and regular safety assessments are a safety theme because the report identifies a lack of regular formal safety observations of container terminal operators as a safety issue. It mentions that "KiwiRail had no requirement to conduct regular formal safety observations of container terminal operators" (4.3.3), which is a gap in the safety oversight that could lead to non-compliance with safety codes and practices. Regular assessments are necessary to ensure ongoing adherence to safety standards.
