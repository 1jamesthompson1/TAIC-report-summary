- name: Load Securing and Compliance with Freight Handling Code
  explanation: Load securing is a critical safety theme in this accident, as the load was not secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, leading to it shifting outside the standard loading gauge and causing damage. The report states that "The load shifted outside the standard loading gauge, and struck several track-side structures and another train, because it had not been secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code" (5.1). Furthermore, "Only half the required number of webbing strops had been used to secure the load and none had edge protectors fitted to prevent them fraying" (5.2), which indicates a failure to adhere to the specific requirements of the Code for load securing.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Safety Protocols
  explanation: Training and familiarity with safety protocols is another significant safety theme, as the staff involved with loading, shifting, and securing the wagon body were not sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code. This lack of knowledge contributed to the non-compliance with the Code. The report highlights that "None of KiwiRail's staff involved with loading and securing the load was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code" (5.4). This indicates a systemic issue with training and knowledge dissemination within the organization.
- name: Availability of Appropriate Load-Securing Equipment
  explanation: The availability of appropriate load-securing equipment is a safety theme that directly impacted the accident. The MDD class special-movement wagon used to transport the load lacked the necessary equipment to secure the load in compliance with the Freight Handling Code. The report finds that "the mdd class special-movement wagon allocated to transport the load from dunedin to christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of equipment made it impossible for staff to secure the load properly, even if they had been aware of the correct procedures.
- name: Adequacy of Safety Management Systems
  explanation: The adequacy of safety management systems is a theme that underlies the accident, as the Freight Handling Code is a part of KiwiRail's safety management system, yet it was not effectively implemented or followed. The report mentions that "The Freight Handling Code was an integral component of KiwiRail's safety management system" (4.3.1), but the failure to train staff and the absence of necessary equipment suggest that the safety management system was not adequately supporting safe operations.
- name: Pre-Departure Inspections and Load Assessment
  explanation: Pre-departure inspections and load assessment are crucial safety themes, as the failure to identify non-compliant loads during these inspections contributed to the accident. The report indicates that "The pre-departure train inspection was the final opportunity to identify 'out-of-Code' loads" (4.3.9), yet the rail operators at Dunedin and Timaru did not identify the securing issues. This suggests a need for more thorough inspections and better training on special load assessments.
- name: Organizational Response to Previous Incidents
  explanation: Organizational response to previous incidents is a safety theme, as prior occurrences had already highlighted the need for better training and application of the Freight Handling Code. The report references an internal investigation from 2008, which "identified the training in, knowledge of and application of the Freight Handling Code as contributory factors" (4.3.11) in separate incidents. This indicates that the organization may not have adequately addressed known safety issues, allowing similar contributing factors to persist until the time of this accident.
