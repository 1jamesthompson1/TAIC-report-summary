","0.0","5.0","While there is no direct mention of communication failures, the lack of crew training in emergency procedures such as the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements (""the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements"" (4.3.4)) suggests a deficiency in crew resource management.
","0.0","15.0","The crew's lack of training for emergency situations, specifically the absence of more encompassing training for flooding and the use of the bilge system, significantly contributed to the inability to manage the flooding effectively (""the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements"" (4.3.4)).
","0.0","5.0","The general degradation and delamination of the hull indicate maintenance issues over time, but there is no specific mention of non-compliance with maintenance procedures as a direct cause of the accident (""The general degradation and delamination of the Dream Weaver’s hull shell laminate was symptomatic of the fatigue failure mechanism"" (4.2.2)).
","7.071","0.0","Fire was not a factor in this accident, so fire detection and suppression systems are not relevant to the analysis.
","0.0","20.0","The omission of safety-critical operating parameters in the Safe Ship Management system, such as the wave-height/speed restriction table not being in the manual or visible in the wheelhouse, was a significant oversight that contributed to the accident (""the omission of safety-critical operating parameters in the Safe Ship Management system had gone undetected"" (4.2.28)).
","0.0","5.0","The master's decision to proceed further offshore in search of whales without considering the worsening sea conditions indicates a lack of situational awareness, which contributed to the vessel being operated outside its permitted wave-height/speed limitations (""the master decided to proceed further off-shore in search of whales, it was predictable that the sea conditions would exceed 2.2 metres"" (4.2.24)).
","7.071","10.0","The vessel's design, being typical for the period it was built with a bridge deck closer to the waterline, contributed to the vulnerability to wave slamming forces, which played a role in the hull failure (""The Dream Weaver’s hull design was typical for the period in which it was built"" (4.1.1)).
","0.0","2.5","There is an indirect implication that risk assessment and management were not adequately conducted, as evidenced by the vessel being operated outside its design parameters and the lack of incorporation of the wave-height/speed restriction table into the Safe Ship Management manual (""the vessel design was fit for its intended purpose at the time of build, and would have continued to be so provided it was operated within its design parameters"" (4.1.4)).
","3.536","2.5","The lack of training and preparedness for emergency situations, such as the absence of documented training for the use of the bilge-pumping system since 2010, indicates poor emergency response planning and coordination (""The most recent documented training in the use of the bilge-pumping system had been in 2010"" (4.3.2)).
","3.536","0.0","There is no evidence in the document to suggest that distracted operation was a factor in the accident.
","0.0","30.0","The hull's structural integrity was compromised due to material fatigue, as indicated by the degradation and delamination of the hull shell laminate, which was a direct cause of the accident (""The hull shell laminate in the area around the centre bow where the rupture occurred was found to have degraded and delaminated"" (4.1.3)).
","14.142","5.0","Human error in the form of the skipper's decision to exceed the safe operating speed and the crew's inability to manage the flooding due to lack of training contributed to the severity of the accident (""The skipper was vaguely aware of the wave-height/speed restriction table, but rarely considered it when operating the Dream Weaver"" (4.2.26)).
","7.071","0.0","The organizational oversight of not including critical safety information in the Safe Ship Management manual and the lack of a safety culture that ensures the crew is trained and prepared for emergencies contributed to the accident (""the omission of safety-critical operating parameters in the Safe Ship Management system had gone undetected"" (4.2.28)).
","0.0","0.0","Weather information was available and accurately forecasted; however, the master's decision to ignore or misinterpret this information was the issue, rather than the dissemination and interpretation of weather information itself (""The MetService weather forecast for the day and sea area where the accident occurred was for wind from the southwest 15 knots rising to 25 knots"" (4.2.19)).
