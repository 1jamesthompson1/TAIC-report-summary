- name: Ageing and Material Degradation
  explanation: 'Ageing and material degradation is a safety theme that refers to the weakening of vessel materials over time due to continuous use and exposure to operational stresses. This theme is relevant to the accident because the "Dream Weaver" had been in operation for approximately 16 years, and the hull''s glass fibre materials had degraded to a point where they were significantly less strong than when initially built (4.2.1, 4.2.6). The general degradation and delamination of the hull shell laminate were symptomatic of fatigue failure mechanisms, which can lead to failure from the general degradation of the material (4.2.2, 4.2.3). The vessel''s hull failed in a typically high-stress area for catamaran vessels: in the bridge deck structure near the bow (5.2).'
- name: Operating Limitations Awareness
  explanation: Operating limitations awareness is a safety theme that involves the crew's understanding of the vessel's operational boundaries, such as maximum wave height and speed restrictions. This theme is crucial to the accident because the "Dream Weaver" was being driven too hard, outside its permitted wave-height/speed limitations, for the sea conditions at the time, causing the hull to rupture at its most vulnerable point (5.3). The skipper was vaguely aware of the wave-height/speed restriction table but rarely considered it when operating the vessel, and the table was not incorporated into the Safe Ship Management manual nor clearly placarded at the conning position (4.2.26, 4.2.27).
- name: Design Evolution and Modernization
  explanation: Design evolution and modernization is a safety theme that addresses the advancements in vessel design and construction methods over time. This theme is relevant because the "Dream Weaver" was built with a hull design typical for the period it was constructed, and since then, both the design and construction methods have evolved (4.1.1, 4.1.2). The bridge deck was closer to the waterline than more modern-style catamarans, which have higher bridge decks to reduce wave slamming forces, indicating that the vessel's design may not have been optimal for current operational conditions (4.1.1).
- name: Emergency Systems Knowledge
  explanation: Emergency systems knowledge is a safety theme that pertains to the crew's ability to operate on-board emergency systems effectively. This theme is significant to the accident because the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements, which contributed to their inability to pump out the flooded bow compartment (5.4). The most recent documented training in the use of the bilge-pumping system had been in 2010, and the deckhand confirmed that he had received no training in the use of the secondary emergency bilge-pumping systems (4.3.2).
- name: Housekeeping Practices
  explanation: Housekeeping practices is a safety theme that involves maintaining cleanliness and order to ensure the safe operation of the vessel. This theme is pertinent to the accident because poor housekeeping practices were identified as a safety issue on board the "Dream Weaver." Small items of equipment and refuse found in the bilge well during the post-accident inspection were blocking the bilge suctions, preventing the primary pump from keeping up with the ingress of water (4.3.5). Additionally, there were other examples of questionable housekeeping practice on board, such as the storage of the LPG gas bottle on the deck (4.3.7).
- name: Structural Modifications and Repairs
  explanation: Structural modifications and repairs is a safety theme that deals with changes made to the vessel's structure and the implications of such alterations on the vessel's integrity. This theme is relevant because the "Dream Weaver" had undergone modifications such as lengthening the vessel, fitting more powerful engines, and fitting a hydrofoil near the bow, which could have altered or increased the stress field in the bow structure (4.2.12). Previous repairs noted around the vessel, including in the area where the rupture occurred, were evidence that supported the conclusion that the glass laminate in the bow region was significantly less strong than when it had been built (4.2.6).
