  \ 's hull design was typical for the period in which  it was built.  The bridge\
  \  \ndeck was closer to the waterline than more modern -style catamarans, which\
  \ typically have  \nbridge deck s higher out of the water to reduce wave slamming\
  \ forces .  \n4.1.2.  The hull was constru cted of single -skin FRP laminate with\
  \ timber structural components.  \nSince its construction both the design  (higher\
  \ bridge decks) and stronger , more resilient \nconstruction methods have evolved,\
  \ as has the understanding of composites and their failure \nmechanisms.  \n4.1.3.\
  \  This accident occurred due to the hull rupturing in the centre bow region under\
  \ the bridge -\ndeck, which allowed seawater to enter and flood the forward section\
  \ of the port hull. This \nflooding caused  the vessel to settle by the bow and\
  \ list to port, forcing  the master to seek \nassistance and sheltered waters with\
  \ the intention of evacuating the passengers.  The hull \nshell laminate in the\
  \ area around the centre  bow where the rupture occurred was found t o \nhave degraded\
  \  and delaminated.  \n4.1.4.  The vessel design was fit for its intended purpose\
  \ at the time of build, and would have \ncontinue d to be so provided it was operated\
  \ within its design parameters, taking into account \nits design, age and the consequence\
  \ s these had for hull strength and performance.  \n4.1.5.  The following analysis\
  \ discusses the likely factors that contributed to the hu ll failure, and also \n\
  discusses three  safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 crew awareness of the operating limitations\
  \ of the vessel  \n\uF0B7 crew operating knowledge of  on-board emergency systems\
  \  \n\uF0B7 housekeeping practices on board affect ing the safe operation of the\
  \ vessel . \n \n4.2. Hull failure  \nAgeing \n4.2.1.  The Dream We aver was built\
  \ in about 1997 and , from what records were available , it had \nbeen in continu\
  \ al operation  since , other than  for the usual periods of layover for maintenance.\
  \  \nThus the Dream Weaver  had spent approximately 16 years in operation.   \n\
  4.2.2.  The general degradation and delamination of the Dream Weaver 's hull shell\
  \ laminate was \nsymptomatic of the fatigue failure mechani sm described by Eric\
  \ Greene Associates.  \n4.2.3.  Eric Greene is a pre -eminent expert in marine composites.\
  \  He noted in his publication Marine \nComposites:  \nComposite materials exhibit\
  \ very complex failure mechanisms under static and \nfatigue loading because their\
  \ st rength and stiffness characteristics vary \ndepending on what direction the\
  \ load is applied. Fatigue causes extensive \ndamage throughout the specimen volume,\
  \ leading to failure from general \ndegradation of the material instead of a predominant\
  \ single crack. Th ere are four \nbasic failure mechanisms in composite materials\
  \ as a result of fatigue: resin \ncracking, delamination between plies, debonding\
  \ of the resin -fibre interface, and \nfibre breakage for solid FRP laminates, with\
  \ the addition of debonding of skins \nfrom the core in sandwich laminates. The\
  \ different failure modes combined with \nthe inherent variation in strength and\
  \ stiffness characteristics, complex stress \nfields, and overall non -linear behaviour\
  \ of composites severely limit our ability to \nunderstand the  true nature of fatigue.\
  \  (Eric Greene Associates, 1999)  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO-2014 -201\
  \ 4.2.4.  Figure 9 shows a graph  that Gougeon Brothers produced comparing the tensile\
  \ fatigue of \nmaterials typically used in boat construction (Gougeon Brothers Incorporated,\
  \ 2005) .  Under \nfatigue testing the strength of glass fibre materials was found\
  \ to reduce t o 20% of the original \nstrength.  Gougeon Brothers estimate d that\
  \ it would take between about 30 hours (for a high -\nspeed power craft ) and 830\
  \ hours (for a sail yacht ) of continuous operation to accumulate one \nmillion\
  \ (106) load cycles .  The wide variation i n time is due to the unknown operational\
  \ profile \nof the vessel, be it a sailing yacht or a high -speed power craft. \
  \ \n4.2.5.  A glass laminate being only 20% of its original strength does not ,\
  \ however , mean that it will \nfail.  Vessels are generally designed with suf ficient\
  \ scantlings16 to absorb normal operating \nforces as the ir strength deteriorates\
  \  with age and use.   \n4.2.6.  It is difficult to estimate the number of  load\
  \ cycles  to which  the Dream Weaver 's bow structure \nwould have been subjected\
  \ in 16 years.  It would  have  depend ed, on average, on how often \nand how hard\
  \ the vessel was driven and in what sea conditions.  It is safe to say , however,\
  \ \nthat the glass laminate in the bow region was significantly less strong than\
  \ when it had been  \nbuilt.  The various previous repairs  noted around the vessel,\
  \ including in the area where the \nrupture occurred , were  evidence that support\
  \ ed this conclusion . \n4.2.7.  The point at which the hull of a boat will fail\
  \ is largely a determinant of the forces acting \nthrough it during operation. \
  \ The design  characteristics of catamarans and the speed  at which \nthey can be\
  \ operated provide additional challenges for designers and operators alike.  These\
  \ \nare discussed in the following sections.  \nForces  \n4.2.8.  Chris McKeeson\
  \ is a university lecturer and author of the bo ok Pract ical Design of Advanced\
  \ \nMarine V ehicles .  In his book McKeeson  notes the difference between mono\
  \ -hull and \ncatamaran vessels:  \nThe big difference here is that [catamarans]\
  \ are designed to specific limiting sea \nconditions. A commercial catamaran [shou\
  \ ld be] provided with a placard \n                                            \
  \            \n16 The dimension of a building material or a structural part of a\
  \ ship . \nFigure 9 \nTensile fatigue comparison of materials (Gougeon Brothers)\

  \ shows the limits for speed and wave height in which \nthe craft can operate. It\
  \ is the master's responsibility to ensure that the craft \nstays within those limits.\
  \     \n[Catamarans] CAN be driven outsi de their permitted envelope, but they MUST\
  \ not \nbe.  Operating a [catamaran] is much more like flying an airplane, or even\
  \ driving \na car, than it is like operation of a displacement monohull: it is entirely\
  \ possible \nto go too fast for the conditions, and br eak the ship, capsize, or\
  \ otherwise end \ncatastrophically. (Chris B McKeeson, 2009)   \n4.2.9.  With respect\
  \ to the forces acting on the structure in a catamaran design , McKeeson says the\
  \ \nforces on the structure are driven by dynamic events rather than static conditions.\
  \  That is to \nsay, the forces on the structure are dominated by the vessel 's\
  \ response to waves.  Owing  to \nthe high accelerations there is high pressure\
  \ and the dominant forces are localised.   \n4.2.10.  There are two origins of fatigue\
  \ in the bridgedeck structure between the bows:  \n\uF0B7 cyclic loading due to\
  \ the buoyancy of the two hulls responding to waves \nslightly out of phase with\
  \ each other, and acting against each other  with \nthe forces transmitted through\
  \ the bridgedeck structure  \n\uF0B7 cyclic wave slamming against the underside\
  \ of the bridge deck.  Wave \nslamming loads would also include high -amplitude\
  \ , single -event wave \nslams.   \n4.2.11.  The stress field17 acting on the hull\
  \ shell laminate will be concentrated in certain areas by the \nshape of the hull\
  \ shell.  Figure s 2 and 4  show the two areas of general laminate degradation \n\
  along the knuckle lines18 either side of the centre bow structure, of which one\
  \ fail ed or \nruptured totally in this accident.  These areas are  likely to be\
  \ where (for the Dream Weaver ) \nthe cyclic stress field overwhelm ed the 'fatigue\
  \ endurance limit ' of the hull shell laminate.  The \nfatigue endurance limit describes\
  \ the structural performa nce of a material over time.  It is a \nfunction of the\
  \ magnitude of stress applied to a material, and the number of cycles in which \n\
  that stress can be applied before  the failure of the material.  For example , a\
  \ typical fatigue \nendurance limit will show that  when the load is very high the\
  \ material will fail after only a few \nload cycles, whereas the same material will\
  \ withstand many load cycles when the load is very \nlow.  \n4.2.12.  Other factors\
  \ that would have  alter ed or increase d the stress field in the bow structure\
  \ were  \nthe lengthening of the vessel, fitting more powerful engines and fitting\
  \ the hydrofoil near the \nbow.  \n4.2.13.  Lengthening a vessel adds more weight\
  \ and potentially changes the stress points in a hull.  \nIncreasing the engine\
  \ power allows the skipper to push the  vessel harder through the waves.  \nA hydrofoil\
  \  also increases the speed potential of the vessel.  \n4.2.14.  The hydrofoil had,\
  \ at some time in the past, sustained damage along its trailing edge and one \n\
  of the two hydrofoil tie rods had been bent.  This damage was indicative of the\
  \ hydrofoil hit ting \na submerged object , rather than normal operating forces\
  \ .  This possibly resulted  from one of \nthe two groundings known to have occurred\
  \ since it had been  fitted.  \n4.2.15.  The hydrofoil usually exert s an upward\
  \ force on the hull throu gh the attachment points on the \nport and starboard hulls\
  \ and through the central strut into the vessel 's longitudinal centre \nbulkhead\
  \ . \n4.2.16.  However , it is unlikely that the hydrofoil contributed directly\
  \ to the hull shell laminate failure \nthat resulted in the f looding , because\
  \ the hull ruptured at a different place from where the \nhydrofoil tie rods  attached\
  \ to the port and starboard hulls.    \n                                       \
  \                 \n17 The stres s field describes the magnitude of stress at each\
  \ point in the structure.   \n18 a small step in the surface of a hull shell, usually\
  \ inserted for cosmetic reasons.  It provides discontinuity in \nthe structure that\
  \ can act to concentrate the stresses acting on  a laminate, which in turn increase\
  \ s the \nlikelihood of a crack initiating or propagating (growing ) at that location\
  \  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO-2014 -201 4.2.17.  Carrying shipped water\
  \ on the foredeck would have increase d the overall stresses in the bow \nregion.\
  \  Witness reports suggest ed that a significant amount of seawater was retained\
  \ on the \nforedeck after the Dream Weaver  turned into the wind and waves for the\
  \ return journey.  The \nfitting  of washboards either side of t he bridge -deck\
  \ would have prevented shipped water \ndraining overboard quickly.  Carrying a large\
  \ weight of water on the foredeck would have \nsubmerged the bow, thereby accelerating\
  \ the accumulation of water on the deck  and \nexacerbating  wave slamming on the\
  \ w eakened underside of the bridge  deck.  \n4.2.18.  It is important to have a\
  \ dequate means for shedding seawater from the decks.  The operator \n(Dream Weaver\
  \ Charters Limited ) will need to address this issue  by either  increasing the\
  \ area \nof over -side openings or remov ing the washboards in inclement weather.\
  \  \nSpeed  and wave height  \n4.2.19.  The MetService weather forecast for the\
  \ day and sea area where the accident occurred was \nfor wind from the southwest\
  \ 15 knots rising to 25 knots , gusting 35 knots around midday, and \nto 30 knots\
  \ gu sting 40 knots in the  evening  - sea becoming rough around midday.  \n4.2.20.\
  \  The weather between 1300 and 1400 ( the time of the accident) , recorded  at\
  \ the Tiritiri \nMatangi Island automatic weather st ation , was a 23 -knot south\
  \ -south west wind with average \ngusts of 31 knots and a maximum gust of 33 knots\
  \ , very similar to what had been forecast.  \n4.2.21.  The company 's written procedures\
  \ were silent on the maximum wind speed or sea state  in \nwhich  the vessel could\
  \ operate .  The decision on whether a trip would proceed was left to t he \nmaster\
  \ alone.  \n4.2.22.  Putting aside passenger comfort, it is the sea state that most\
  \ ly affects the safety of catamaran \noperations.  That was the reason  for the\
  \ naval architect placing wave -height  and speed \nrestrictions on the Dream Weaver\
  \ .  Wind speed does affect the sea state, but to varying \ndegrees when operating\
  \ in and around inshore waters.  Relatively smooth seas can be found \nin the lee\
  \ of land even when the wind is strong.  The greater the distance the wind blows\
  \ \nacross the sea uninterr upted by land, the bigger the waves will become19. \n\
  4.2.23.  The topography of the Hauraki Gulf is such that when the wind blows  from\
  \ the southwest the \nseas get rougher the farther out into the G ulf a vessel g\
  \ oes.  The master's decision to proceed \nwith the trip in th e forecast weather\
  \ conditions was not inappropriate provided he intended to \nstay within the inner\
  \ Hauraki Gulf, the area where the vessel had made contact and interacted \nwith\
  \ the pod of dolphins.  \n4.2.24.  However, when the master decided to proceed further\
  \ off -shore in search of whales, it was \npredictable that the sea conditions would\
  \  exceed 2.2 metres,  particularly as the tide was \nflooding into the Hauraki\
  \ Gulf against the direction of the wind and waves20.  When the tide or \ncurrent\
  \ opposes the direction of the wave s, the waves shorten, rise up and steepen, creating\
  \ \nmore difficult conditions for small vessels.  \n4.2.25.  It was highly likely\
  \ that the observable wave height at the time and place of the accident \nexceeded\
  \ 2.2 metres, as evidenced by the recorded weather condition s and the statements\
  \ \nfrom the passengers and crew.  A t that time  the Dream Weaver 's speed should\
  \ have been \nkept to under 10 knots, and heavy slamming forces under the bow region\
  \ should have been \navoided.  The deckhand recalled seeing on the GPS readout tha\
  \ t the speed at that time was \nabout 11.7 knots.  \n4.2.26.  The skipper was vaguely\
  \ aware of the wave -height/speed restriction table, but rarely \nconsidered it\
  \ when operating the Dream Weaver .  This is unsurprising given that the table had\
  \ \n                                                        \n19 The length of water\
  \ over which a given wind has blown is referred to as the 'fetch'.  \n20 The National\
  \ Institute of Water and Atmospheric Res earch 's tide forecaster program predicted\
  \ the time of \nhigh water near Tiritiri Matangi Island for 1400.  \n \nFinal report\
  \ MO -2014 -201 \n<< Page 17 >>\n not been incorporated into the  Safe Ship Management\
  \  manual and neither had it been clearly \nplacarded at the conning position21.\
  \ \n4.2.27.  As McKeeson states, it is generally easy for a skipper of a catamaran\
  \ to exceed the safe \noperating speed and cause damage to the vessel.  The  Dream\
  \ Weaver  had two pre-existing \nareas of general laminate degradation along the\
  \ knuckle lines either side of the centre bow \nstructure .  It is highly likely\
  \ that these two weakened areas and the slamming forces caused by \nthe Dream Weaver\
  \  being driven too fast into the wav es were  the two main factors that \ncontributed\
  \  to the hull failure and subsequent flooding of the lower port hull.  \n4.2.28.\
  \  It is a concern that  the omission of safety -critical operating parameters in\
  \ the Safe Ship \nManagement system  had gone undetected by the vessel owner and\
  \ operator; had not been \ntransferred with the change in Safe Ship Management \
  \ provider; and had not been picked up \nduring subsequent audits and surveys .\
  \ In particular , the wave -height/speed restriction table \nwas not  in the Safe\
  \ Ship Management manual and not visible in the wheelhouse . These \nconcerns are\
  \ especially significant  given that  the vessel was of older design and construction\
  \ \nand known to have previously suffered structural failure due to heavy weather.\
  \  \n4.3. Respo nse to the flooding  \nTraining  \n4.3.1.  The Safe Ship Management\
  \  system includes the training o f the crew to an acceptable \nstandard.  \n4.3.2.\
  \  The training records  kept on board showed that basic training had been conducted\
  \ for the \ncrew.  However, the re was an absence of  more encompassing training\
  \ for emergency \nsituations such as flooding  and the use of the bilge system.\
  \  The most recent  documented \ntraining in the use of the bilge -pumping system\
  \ had been  in 2010.  The deckhand confirmed \nthat he had received no training\
  \ in  the use of the secondary  emergency bilge -pumping \nsystems.   \n4.3.3. \
  \ The deckhand had received training on helming (driving) the Dream Weaver  from\
  \ previous \nmasters .  However , he had not received any training on how to drive\
  \ the Dream Weaver  from \nthe current master . When the flooding occurred the master\
  \ thought he was committed to \ndriving the vessel .  Therefore w ith the master\
  \ committed to the wheel  there was no -one else \nwho had the knowledge to operate\
  \ the pumping systems.  This was a serious oversight of the \ntrain ing system on\
  \ board  that Dream Weaver Charters will need to address.  \n4.3.4.  The Dream Weaver\
  \  had two separate bilge -pumping systems.  The secondary or emergency \nsystem\
  \ was a main -engine -driven pump in each hull.  The primary system  included a\
  \  series of \nautomatic electric bilge pumps; four in each hull in separate compartments\
  \ , each with a rated \nmaximum capacity of approximately 14 cubic metres per hour.\
  \   If both systems had been \navailable to pump the water out of the forward port\
  \ hull, it is f easible that the vessel could \nhave returned to port without assistance\
  \ and without any undue risk to the passengers and \ncrew.  \nHousekeeping  \n4.3.5.\
  \  The bilge suctions for b oth the primary and secondary bilge systems were housed\
  \ in the same \nbilge compartment.  Figur es 6 and 7 show small items of equipment\
  \ and refuse found in the \nbilge well during the post -accident inspection .  These\
  \ items were blocking the bilge suctions \nand were highly likely the reason for\
  \ the primary pump being  unable to keep up with the \ningress o f water through\
  \ the ruptured hull.  This also meant  that even if someone had \nsucceeded in getting\
  \ the secondary bilge system operating, it too would have failed due to the \nblocked\
  \  bilge suction.  \n                                                        \n\

  \ on board vessels is a safety issue.  Good h ousekeeping is essential for \nmaintaining\

  \ \nspaces.  \n4.3.7.  There were other examples of questionable housekeeping practice\
  \ on board the Dream \nWeaver .  The storage of the LPG gas bottle on the deck was\
  \ one.  \n4.3.8.  Dream Weaver  Charters will need to take action to address th\
  \ is safety  issue. \n  \n \nFinal report MO -2014 -201 \n<< Page 19 >>"
