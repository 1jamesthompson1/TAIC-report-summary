Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Hull degradation and delamination: The hull of the Dream Weaver had degraded and delaminated over time, leading to the rupture that allowed seawater to flood the port hull. The aging of the vessel and the fatigue failure mechanism of composite materials contributed to this degradation.

2. Operating outside design parameters: The vessel was being driven too hard and at a speed that exceeded its permitted wave-height/speed limitations for the sea conditions at the time. This caused excessive slamming forces on the weakened hull, leading to the rupture.

3. Lack of crew training and awareness: The crew had not received adequate training in emergency procedures, including the use of the bilge-pumping systems. This lack of knowledge and training prevented them from effectively responding to the flooding. Additionally, the crew was not aware of the operating limitations of the vessel and the on-board emergency systems.

4. Poor housekeeping practices: The presence of small items of equipment and refuse in the bilge compartment blocked the bilge suctions, preventing the primary and secondary bilge-pumping systems from effectively removing the water. This highlights the importance of good housekeeping practices for maintaining a safe operation.

5. Inadequate safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not ensure that wave-height/speed restrictions were clearly communicated and enforced, that the crew received adequate training, and that proper housekeeping practices were maintained on board the vessel. This failure in the safety management system contributed to the accident.
