  \ did not fully extend when the pilots selected the \nlanding gear  down  on approach\
  \ to Woodbourne Aerodrome.  The reasons for this are \ndiscussed below, but the\
  \ nose landing gear not fully extending is not the main concern.  The \nmain concern\
  \ is that the pilots thought it was down and locked when in fact it wasn't.  \n\
  4.2. There are a number of reasons why the nose landing gear  might fail to extend\
  \  fully using the \nnormal system , which is why aeroplane s are  required to have\
  \  an alternative means of \nextension .  There are procedures and checklists to\
  \ help the pilots to achieve this.  Howeve r, in \nthis case one of the system s\
  \ for checking that the landing gear was down and locked was \npoorly designed and\
  \ gave the crew a false indication that the nose landing gear was down and \nlocked.\
  \  The flight crew then continued the approach in the expectati on of  making  a\
  \ normal \nlanding.  \n4.3. This report discusses the design of the verification\
  \ system that false ly indicat ed that the nose \nlanding gear was down and locked.\
  \  It also discusses whether, if the indication system had not \nbeen faulty , the\
  \ crew could have succeeded in extending the nose landing gear  fully by \nalternative\
  \ means.  \n4.4. The pilots were justified in believing the  verification light\
  \  that showed that the nose landing \ngear was down and locked .  However , later\
  \  in the approach the aeroplane systems gave them \nanother 2 alerts that the landing\
  \ gear was not safe.  The report discusses the pilots' reaction s \nto th ose additional\
  \ warnings .  The role of CRM  in dealing with such incidents  is also discussed\
  \ . \nNose landing gear extend/ retract actuator defect  \n4.5. The nose landing\
  \ gear actuator most likely jamm ed because pieces of the damaged piston \nseal\
  \ and its back -up rings had blocked at least one of the internal ports.   After\
  \ the landing gear \nselector lever had been placed to DOWN , the main landing gear\
  \ locked down normally, \nshowing that the electrical and hydraulic sub -systems\
  \ worked correctly.  The nose landing gear \nup-lock had release d and the extend\
  \ actuator had begun to extend the leg .  If the UP port had \nthen  blocked, the\
  \  fluid on th at side of the dual-acting piston would have been prevented from\
  \ \nreturning to the reservoir , thereby creating a hydraulic lock  that would have\
  \ prevented further \nmovement of the actuator . \n4.6. The pieces of damaged seal\
  \ were not the only co ntaminants  found in the system.   The \nanalyses of the\
  \ fluid by the Transport Safety Board of Canada and the Defence Technology \nAgency\
  \ agreed broad ly on  the nature of the metallic particles, that their origin was\
  \ most likely \nother components powered by the #2 hydraulic system, and that the\
  \ organic compounds \ncame from the seal and the back -up rings.  Aluminium was\
  \ the predominant metallic debris, \nbut the a luminium cylinder of the nose landing\
  \ gear  actuator was not worn.  Therefore the \nmetal came from elsewhere in the\
  \ nose landing gear  system.  \n4.7. In March 2 011 the nose landing gear  door\
  \ actuator  cylinder was found to be worn beyond \nlimits and to contain debris\
  \ from its seal and back -up rings.  That actuator had not been \nremoved from ZK\
  \ -NEB after the September 2010 incident, because the previous routine \nanalyse\
  \ s of the hydraulic fluid had not caused concern for the condition of that or any\
  \ other \ncomponent.  \n4.8. The wear on the  door actuator cylinder suggested that\
  \ it was the source of much of the metal \nfound on the extend/retract  actuator\
  \ and other components in ZK -NEB.  A comparison with \ndoor actuators from other\
  \ aeroplanes suggested this could be a fleet  issue , which  the \nmanufacturer\
  \ and operator are continu ing to investigate .  Th e Commission is recommending\
  \ \nthat the Director of Civil Aviation monitor the progress of those investigations\
  \ and liaise with \nTransport Canada in order to produce acceptable corrective action\
  \ s. \n4.9. Hydraulic fluid samples from ZK -NEB analysed  since the nose landing\
  \ gear door actuator was \nreplaced in March 2011 have been satisfactory.  \n\n\
  << Page 24 >>\n Report 10 -010 4.10.  A confounding issue during the investigation,\
  \ especially after the incident in February 2011, \nwas the presence of metal fines\
  \ on the nose landing gear actuator piston seals .  As Air Nelson \nhad no experience\
  \ of  disassembl ing the actuators, it did not know whether the condition of an\
  \ \nactuator that had performed  10 000 cycles was similar to that of one that had\
  \ reached  the \naverage overhaul life of more than 30 000 cycles.  However, Messier\
  \ -Dowty and the various \nexaminations indicated  that metal fines were always\
  \ present and a result of normal wear and \ntear.  \n4.11.  The initiating cause\
  \ of the seal damage was not conclusively determined.  A manufacturing \ndefect\
  \ or incorrect seating of the seal during the assembly of the actuator cannot be\
  \ excluded.  \nHaving been damaged, the seal would have been progressively eroded\
  \ by  normal hydraulic \npressure fluctuations and by the larger metallic particles\
  \ that contaminated the hydraulic fluid. \n4.12.  The nose  landing gear extend/retract\
  \ actuator  has been a reliable component across the \nworld -wide Q300 fleet. \
  \ The damage to the seals found  in this actuator is therefore considered \nto be\
  \ unusual.  For this reason the manufacturer has not amended its maintenance \n\
  requirements for the actuator, and the Commission concurs with this decision.  \n\
  4.13.  In the 5 weeks before this incident, 2 nose landing gea r defects on ZK -NEB\
  \ were investigated \nand the aeroplane was released to service without  any definite\
  \ cause s being found.  The \nintermittent nature of these defects, particularly\
  \ the retraction event, might now be recognised \nas symptom atic of fluid contamina\
  \ tion or an actuator defect.  Neither the nose landing gear \nactuator nor the\
  \ door actuator was replaced.    \n4.14.  Air Nelson amended its maintenance response\
  \ to the contamination of the #2 hydraulic \nsystem to include replacement of the\
  \ nose landing gear actuator a nd the nose landing gear \ndoor actuator, in addition\
  \ to replacement of the filters and the #2 system fluid.  Air Nelson \nalso put\
  \ a finite life on the nose landing gear door actuators, pending the outcome of\
  \ the \ninvestigation referred to above.  \n4.15.  The on-condition  main tenance\
  \ p rocess should pre vent the failure or degradation of a \ncomponent from causing\
  \ an operational incident by recognising th e imminent  or likely need to \nrepair\
  \ or replace  the component  before that happens.   System redundancies and non-normal\
  \ \nprocedures cater for m ost sudden failures, but the on-condition process is\
  \ not intended to be \none of \"fit until failure \".  Pilot reports of unusual\
  \ system  operation  are as much a part of on -\ncondition monitoring  as obvious\
  \ defects, such as a leaking seal. \n4.16.  The maintenance response to reported\
  \ defects is usually straightforward  when the cause s of \nthe defect s are  obvious\
  \ .  When the cause is not so obvious , or if the ma intenance manual \nlacks specific\
  \ guidance,  troubleshooting will often follow the process  of elimination of \n\
  potential causes , which may mean th e replacement of components .  That process,\
  \ particularly \nwhere there is an intermittent defect, may appear to remedy  the\
  \ defect , only for it to return \nlater.   For this reason, maintenance action\
  \ might i nitially fail to identify the true cause of a \ndefect . \nFindings  \n\
  The failure of the nose landing gear  to extend fully was most likely caused by\
  \ debris in \nthe hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within  the nose landing gear\
  \  extend/retract \nhydraulic actuator .  The debris probably  came from damaged\
  \ seals within the \nactuator.  \nThe damage to the seals  within the extend/retract\
  \ hydraulic actuator could have \ninitially been caused by a manufacturing defect\
  \ in the seal s or by  an incorrect \nassembly technique .  The damag e may have\
  \ been exacerbated by debris in the \nhydraulic fluid that originated from excessive\
  \ wear in another actuator in the system, \nthe one that opened and closed the forward\
  \ nose landing gear doors.  \n \nReport 10 -010 \n<< Page 25 >>\n Two instances\
  \ of unusual operation of the nose landing gear had been  reported in the \n5 weeks\
  \ prior  to th e failure  to extend at Woodbourne .  The cause of the earlier events\
  \  \nwas probably the same as that of the failure to extend.  \nReason for the f\
  \ alse down -lock verification  \n4.17.  When the pilots  moved  the landing gear\
  \ selector lever to DOWN  on the approach to \nWoodbourne, the  \"Landing ear Inop\
  \ \" caution light did not illuminate , but the  indicators on the \nlanding gear\
  \ panel told them that the nose landing gear was in an unsafe condition .  The u\
  \ se \nof the \"Landing gear fails to extend \" procedure  in the Air Nelson QRH\
  \  was the appropriate \naction for the  pilots  to take .  The procedure  stated\
  \ that if either the advisory indicator  on the \nforward panel or the verification\
  \ light under the alternate extension flap w as green, the \ncorresponding  landing\
  \ gear leg was down  and locked .  The 2 indication systems were \nindependent \
  \ of each other .  \n4.18.  The text of the QRH removed any doubt  for the pilots\
  \ .  It clearly stated that if either light was \ngreen , the relevant landing \
  \ gear leg was down and locked.   When the pilots saw the green \nverification light\
  \ for all 3 landing gears, including the nose landing gear , the pilots  had every\
  \ \nright  to believe the verification light, and halt the \"Landing gear fails\
  \ to extend \" procedure . \n4.19.  The captain said that in his capacity as the\
  \ airline 's flight operations representative at \nBombardier customer seminars\
  \ , he had heard the saying \"a green is a green \" used to \nemphasise the dependability\
  \  of the verification system.  His  comment that \"a green  is a \ngreen \", made\
  \ when he declined the first officer's suggestion to fly past the control tower\
  \ and \nhave the nose landing gear  position checked by the controller, reflected\
  \ his confidence  in the \nverification system.   Most other pilot s would have\
  \ conclude d at that point that all of the \nlanding gear was down.   Notwithstanding\
  \ that confidence , shortly afterwards he requested a \nsecond check of the verification\
  \ light, and both pilots confirmed that it was  still green . \n4.20.  Clearly,\
  \ the nose landing gear down -lock v erification had been false . That error was\
  \ replicated \nthe following day  during  ground  checks .  Laboratory testing confirmed\
  \ that the verification \nsensor would be activated  if the taxi light was ON before\
  \ the nose landing gear  had extended  \nfully.  The operator's normal procedure\
  \ was to s witch  the taxi light ON immediatel y after the \nlanding gear selector\
  \ lever was put to DOWN .  There was no reason to believe that the pilots \non this\
  \ flight had deviated from that p rocedure .  Therefore it was almost certain that\
  \ the taxi \nlight had been  ON when the verification lights  were checked  and\
  \ that with the nose landing \ngear in the partially extended position, the bright\
  \ taxi light caused the false  indication . \n4.21.  The cause of the false  indication\
  \ the da y after the incident, wh ile the taxi light was OFF,  was \nnot determined\
  \ , but it could have  been  that the sunshine  reflected from the concrete apron\
  \ \nwas bright enough  to activate the sensor  that illuminated the green indicator\
  \ light in the \ncockpit . The manufacturer had not recognised th e possibility\
  \  of stray light activating the \nsensor when the taxi light position was shifted\
  \ from the external nose cone, where it had been \non earlier Dash 8 models, to\
  \ the nose landing gear  strut.  The  manufacturer issued a service \nletter in\
  \ April 2011 and a dded a note to the QRH to remind pilots to ensure that the taxi\
  \ lig ht \nwas OFF when checking the verification lights . \n4.22.  The change to\
  \ the QRH resolves the issue  of stray light from the taxi light causing a false\
  \ \nindication.  However, the incident in New Guinea in March 2012, involving an\
  \ aeroplane  that \ndid not have the taxi light on the nose landing gear  strut\
  \ , showed that the re must be other \ncause s for  false  indications.   Air Nelson\
  \  had identified at least 2 other causes: moisture \ningress and the chafing of\
  \ wires.  \n4.23.  These defects and  reports of occasional false  in-flight  verification\
  \ s suggest ed that  the \nreliability of the verification system for the Q300 (and\
  \ Dash 8  series ) did not warrant the trust \nplaced in it by the manufacturer\
  \ . \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Report 10 -010 4.24.  The Commission recommend s that the\
  \ Director of the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority \nwork with  Transport Canada\
  \ to require the manufacturer to improve the reliability and \ndependability of\
  \ the l anding gear down -lock verification system . \nFindings  \nWith the nose\
  \ landing gear stuck in a partially  extended position, light from the taxi \nlight\
  \ was likely detected by the sensor for the down -lock verification system, causing\
  \ it \nto give a false green light.  \nThe false green light on the verification\
  \ system misled t he pilots of ZK -NEB into \nbelieving  that the nose landing gear\
  \ was fully down and locked . \nThe verification system for checking if the landing\
  \ gear is down and locked on the \nDash 8 series of air craft is not reliable enough\
  \  for pilots to place total trust in it when \ntrying to establish the status of\
  \ the landing gear.  \nOther means of extending the nose landing gear  \n4.25. \
  \ After the nose of ZK -NEB was lifted from the runway, the nose landing gear lowered\
  \ u nder its \nown weight, which confirmed  that the up -lock had released .  The\
  \ fact that the actuator then \nmoved freely  indicated that it was no longer jammed\
  \ , possibly because the partly extended \nwheels had been forced  back into the\
  \ wheel well during the landin g.  That r everse actuator \nmovement could have\
  \ dislodged any debris in the actuator.  With th is possibility  and the 199 5 \n\
  incident  in mind , the Commission consider ed whether the nose  landing gear might\
  \ have been \nexten ded by another method.    \n4.26.  The false down -lock indication\
  \ caused the pilots , in accordance with  the QRH , to stop the  \n\"Landing gear\
  \ fails to extend \" procedure .  Therefore they had no reason  to try the alternate\
  \ \nextension procedure.  However, i t is probable that t hey would have tried that\
  \ procedure if they \nhad known  (for example,  from having asked the controller)\
  \  that the nose landing gear , in spite \nof the verification light showing otherwise,\
  \  was definitely not down.  \n4.27.  During an alternate extension procedure, hydraulic\
  \ pressure is equali sed within  the landing \ngear system .  Whether simply depressurising\
  \ the hydraulic system would allow any debris to \ndislodge from the \"retract \"\
  \ (up) restrictor would depend on the size of the debris and how \nsolidly it was\
  \ entrapped there .  The debris was likely to have be en forced into the orifice\
  \ of the \nrestrictor under  hydraulic pressure  as the nose landing gear tried\
  \ to extend.  It is unlikely \ntherefore that the debris would simply have fallen\
  \ out when the hydraulic pressure was \nremoved.  \n4.28.  For the alternate extension\
  \ proc edure to have succeeded, the debris would have to have \ndislodged, or as\
  \ discussed earlier, been forced out by hydraulic fluid flowing through the \nrestrictor\
  \ in the opposite direction.  If the pilots had not been given 3 green verification\
  \ lights , \nthey woul d have gone straight to the alternate extension procedure.\
  \  There would therefore \nhave been no opportunity for such a reverse flow of hydraulic\
  \ fluid through the restrictor.  For \nthis reason it is unlikely that the alternate\
  \ extension procedure would have succeeded in \nextending the nose  landing gear\
  \  in this case.  \n4.29.  The troubleshooting and the 2 earlier events had show\
  \ n that the defect was intermittent.  The \nnose landing gear moved in the retract\
  \ direction when the nose wheels were pushed back into \nthe wheel w ell during\
  \ the landing.  Therefore c ycling the landing gear up and then down again \ncould\
  \ have dislodged any debris caught in the actuator and allowed the nose landing\
  \ gear to \nlock down.  However, the QRH did not at th at time provide  for the\
  \ landing gear to  be cycled.  \n4.30.  Air Nelson confirmed that its training followed\
  \ the manufacturer's advice that the landing gear \nselector lever should not be\
  \ moved following an unexpected landing gear condition, unless the \nQRH direct\
  \ ed otherwise.  The reason given for this was that if the gear stops in an unsafe\
  \ \nReport 10 -010 \n<< Page 27 >>\n condition, one reason could be that the sequence\
  \ of doors opening, landing gear extending \nand doors closing again is disrupted.\
  \  Cycling the landing gear in this case could cause \ndamage such as driving the\
  \ wheels int o out -of-sequence landing gear doors.  Therefore the \npilots' decision\
  \ not to cycle the landing gear selector lever was appropriate.  \n4.31.  Since\
  \ then the manufacturer has issued a service letter that  discusses  resetting the\
  \ alternate \nextension system , if it has been used  without success , and situations\
  \ when cycling the landing \ngear might be an option .  Such an action would be\
  \  a last resort  and at the captain's discretion . \n4.32.  Cycling the landing\
  \ gear might be prudent for a situation where only one side of the main \nlanding\
  \ gear is down and locked , because there is a higher risk of an unsuccessful landing\
  \  \nwith that configuration .  In that case the captain has nothing to lose by\
  \ cycling the landing \ngear.  If , however , both sides of the landing gear are\
  \ down and locked and the nose landing \ngear is not, as in this case,  the captain\
  \ would need to consider whether cycling the landing \ngear could exacerbate the\
  \ problem.  The captain would have to choose between landing with \nonly the nose\
  \ landing gear retracted , or cycling the landing gear and potentially encountering\
  \ a \nproblem with the main landing gear  as well or instead.  \nFindings  \nHad\
  \ the pilots known that the nose landing gear was not down and locked and then \n\
  tried  the alternate extension procedure, th at acti on would have been  unlikely\
  \  to \nsucceed because debris would probably still have been bloc king the restrictor\
  \ within \nthe hydraulic actuator . \nAssuming that the reason for the nose landing\
  \ gear not fully extending was debris in the \nhydraulic fluid, it is possible that\
  \ cycling the landing gear up and down again would \nhave succeeded in getting all\
  \ of the landing gear down and locked .  However , that \naction was not recommended\
  \ by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.  \nThe pilots ' responses to  the aur\
  \ al warnings  \n4.33.  The verification light indicated to the pilots that the\
  \ nose landing gear was down and locked, \nand that conclusion was reinforced by\
  \ the text in the QRH.  As the verification system was \nindependent of the proximity\
  \ sensors and relied simply on having an unobstructed light beam, \nthe green light\
  \ also strongly suggested that the advisory light on the landing gear panel must\
  \ \nbe wrong.  Both pilots said they therefore assumed that the landing gear status\
  \ , as \ndetermined by the proximity sensor logic  and used by other systems , was\
  \ wrong.  This led \nthem to disregard the landing gear warning horn and the ground\
  \ proximity warning system \nalert that sounded shortly before landing . \n4.34.\
  \  The captain said he had expected the aural warnings, but he omitted to forewarn\
  \ the first \nofficer.  A lthough each pilot said he had decided th at th e aural\
  \ warnings were false, neither \nclearly stated this  to the other .  Warnings,\
  \ especially ground proximity system warnings, should \nnot be ignored  without\
  \ the involved pilots agr eeing that the proposed action will be \nacceptable. \
  \  By not doing so, the pilots have no opportunity to express any doubt and resolve\
  \ \nit. \n4.35.  The first officer later added  that, as the runway was in sight,\
  \ there had been no risk of a \ncollision with terrain.  Th at explanation suggested\
  \ he had not interpreted correctly the cause \nof the active ground proximity warning\
  \ mode .  The alert \"Too low gear \" refers to the aeroplane \nnot being in the\
  \ correct configuration for landing, rather than a n impending  collision with t\
  \ he \nground as such.  His further comment that he had been confident yet uneasy\
  \ at the same time \nsuggested that he may have been hasty in his response to the\
  \ warnings . \n4.36.  The Proximity Switch Electronics Unit determines that the\
  \ nose landing gear is locked down  \nwhen both down -lock sensors signal that condition.\
  \  One faulty nose landing gear down -lock \nsensor could cause the Proximity Switch\
  \ Electronics Unit to determine that the nose landing \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Report\
  \ 10 -010 gear is not locked down, and therefore the nose landing gear \"unsafe\
  \ \" and \"doors open \" lights \nwould remain illuminated.  These  were the indications\
  \ seen in this incident.   Because the \ngreen verification light showed (falsely)\
  \ that the nose landing gear was locked down, the pilots \nreason ed that a faulty\
  \ sensor  was the cause . \n4.37.  A configuration warning, such as \"too low gear\
  \ \", is not considered by the system manufacturer \nto be a  hard warning, like\
  \ \"Terrain! Pull up! \", which requires a mandatory, immediate escape \nmanoeuvre.\
  \  The normal response for a pilot is to correct the condition  causing the alert\
  \ ; \nnamely,  extend the landing gear .  However, by design these alerts occur\
  \ late in an approach \nand as there will be  little time or height available ,\
  \ the best response is invariably to go ar ound \nand, when at a safe height, to\
  \ review the sit uation.  \n4.38.  The pilots said that they had had enough fuel\
  \ to go around  again .  Had they done so, one \nwould expect that they would  have\
  \ asked the controller to report  the nose landing gear  \nposition , as the first\
  \ officer had earlier suggested they do.  \n4.39.  Had the controller said that\
  \ the nose landing gear did not appear to be down, the pilots would \nhave realised\
  \ that the aural warnings were genuine.  It would  then  have been logical for them\
  \ \nto disregard the (false) green verification lights  and go back to the \"Land\
  \ ing gear fails to \nextend \" checklist .  This would  have directed them to perform\
  \ the alternate extension \nprocedure .  However , as mentioned above, that procedure\
  \ would have been  unlikely to   \nsucce ed in this case, because the actuator was\
  \ jammed.  \n4.40.  A fly-by cannot confirm absolutely that a  landing gear leg\
  \ is locked down, especially at night, \nbut an observer can report the landing\
  \ gear appearance.  In the case of the nose landing gear \non the Q300, if the wheels\
  \ appear down and the forward doors are c losed, th at is useful \ninformation,\
  \ because th e Proximity Switch Electronics Unit must sense that the landing gear\
  \ is \ndown and locked  before it will signal the doors to close.  \n4.41.  The\
  \ pilots could have sought technical advice from the operator  and likely would\
  \ have done so \nhad they gone around in response to the aural warnings .  If it\
  \ had been confirmed that the \nnose landing gear was not locked down, the checklist\
  \ would have led the  pilots  to silence the \npotentially distracting warnings\
  \ and they would have instr ucted the flight attendant to prepare \nthe cabin for\
  \ an emergency landing.  \n4.42.  The operator later clarified the action it expected\
  \ its pilots to take, including making use of an \nexternal observer, when there\
  \ was a disagreement between landing gear position indi cations.  \n4.43.  The pilots'\
  \ CRM training covered general problem -solving techniques , but in this case they\
  \ did \nnot use all of the  available resources , in particular the use of external\
  \ observers and  taking \naction that would give them  more time.   The f light\
  \ attendant  demonstrated her alertness and \ninitiative by check ing that th e\
  \ main landing gear  was down  when she heard the warnings .  \nHowever, she had\
  \ not been told of the earlier abnormal gear indication  and her training told \n\
  her not to interrupt the pilots a t a late stage in the approach , especially if\
  \ only to tell them that \nthe main landing gear  looked norma l. \nFinding s \n\
  The aural warnings that not all of the landing gear was locked down were genuine\
  \ \nwarnings.  Pilots must respect warnings.  In this case, the pilots should have\
  \ \nresponded by performing a go -around, which would have given them more time\
  \ to \nconsider the situation . \nThe pilots did not use all of the available resources\
  \ to confirm the nose landing gear \nposition.  If they had asked the controller\
  \ to confirm the status of the nose landing \ngear, it is likely th at th ey would\
  \ have taken further action  in an  attempt to get the nose \nlanding gear  locked\
  \ down.  \n \nReport 10 -010 \n<< Page 29 >>\n Other crew resource management issues\
  \  \n4.44.  The following further examples of crew interaction  are discussed as\
  \ lessons for the better \nhandling of abnormal situations : \n\uF0B7 the lack of\
  \ information to the flight attendant  \n\uF0B7 the carrying out o f the QRH checklist\
  \ . \nInforming the flight attendant  \n4.45.  Flight attendants are on board  aircraft\
  \ primarily for the safet y of passengers.  The operator's \nCRM training emphasised\
  \ the communication and co -ordination that should occur between \nthe flight deck\
  \ and flight attendant so that all of the crew are  properly informed of any matter\
  \ \nthat might affect the safety of the aeroplane and those on board, or affect\
  \ the discharge of \ntheir respective duties.   Communication with flight attendants\
  \ is particularly important for \nthose who work alone in the cabin, as  with this\
  \ operator.  \n4.46.  The training for flight attendants includes  the prepar ation\
  \ of the cabin and the advice to give \npassengers in the event that an emergency\
  \ or abnormal landing is anticipated and the \nemergency evacuation of the aeroplane\
  \ after landing.  The operator required its flight \nattendant s to carry out a\
  \ silent self-brief before every take -off and landing so that they would  \nbe\
  \ better prepare d for unexpected emergenc ies. \n4.47.  A go-around from a landing\
  \ approach  is not common, but this flight attendant ha d been on \nboard flights\
  \ when this had occurred .  The captain did not advise her o f the reason for the\
  \ go -\naround , because soon afterwards he believ ed there was no problem  and\
  \ a normal landing \nwould follow .  However, the Commission thinks he ought to\
  \ have done this.  I t would have \ntaken just half a minute to explain  the situation\
  \ t o her .  Under most circumstances that could \nbe done using the  public address\
  \  system , thereby inform ing the passengers  at the same time .  \nBeing less\
  \ accustomed than flight attendan ts to go -arounds, some passengers could be \n\
  anxious , and information can dispel anxiety.  \n4.48.  Had th is experienced flight\
  \ attendant known what had led to the go -around, she might  have \nconsidered abnormal\
  \ landing condition s and her s ilent s elf-brief  could have been more \npertinent.\
  \  Even though she was unconcerned  by the continuing aural warnings , with \nknowledge\
  \ of what had happened she would  have been better primed for action had the \n\
  landing been  less favourable .  Then s he would have been justified in commanding\
  \ the \npassengers \"Head down, stay down \" at the first sound and sign that the\
  \ landing was not , in \nfact, normal.  \nFinding  \nThe captain  should have  explained\

  \  that the situation had been resolved .  The flight \nattendant would h ave been\
  \ better prepared should the landing have been less \nfavourable.  \n \nThe carrying\
  \ out of the QRH  checklist  \n4.49.  Through his company appointment and participation\
  \ in the manufacturer's seminars , the \ncaptain had considerable knowledge of the\
  \ global Q300 operational experience, abnormal \nlanding gear conditions, and the\
  \ development of QRH checklists.  When the first officer \nadvised him that the\
  \ nose landing gear  appeared to be not down , the captain a nticipated that \n\
  they would have to perform the alternate extension procedure.  \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n\
  \ Report 10 -010 4.50.  Perhaps it was t his anticipation  that led the captain\
  \ to interrupt the first officer 's read ing of \nthe QRH checklist.   In a couple\
  \ of instances, the captain pre -empted the first officer 's \nresponses , but between\
  \ them all of the checklist items were covered . \n4.51.  The captain's comment\
  \ while the first officer was  checking the verification lights  that they \nwere\
  \  \"not the problem \" suggested a predetermination of the problem and interfer\
  \ ed with the \nproper  following of the  checklist.  The first officer took the\
  \ comment to mean th at he would \nsee 3  verification lights , meaning all of the\
  \ landing gear was down .  When he did see  3 green \nverification lights,  that\
  \ indicated  to him that the nose landing gear advisory light s on the \ninstrument\
  \ panel were wrong .  The false  verification light s supported the first officer's\
  \ \ninterpretation of the captain's comment and probably  influence d his later\
  \ belief that the aural \nwarnings  were false. \n4.52.  However, the captain 's\
  \ explanation was he did not expect to see a green verification light for \nthe\
  \ nose landing gear  and he expected that an alternate extension would follow .\
  \  Having \ninterrupted the first officer's checklist responses, the captain was\
  \ then surprised by hearing \nthere were 3 green lights and he twice asked the first\
  \ officer to confirm that.  The captain later  \nasked for the verification lights\
  \  to be checked once more before they landed . \n4.53.  Unvoiced assumptions and\
  \ doubts when faced with a problem are the antithesis of good crew \ncommunication\
  \ and problem -solving.  Interrupting the reading of a checklist, especially one\
  \ \nfrom the QRH , breaks the flow of the checklist, and can lead to items being\
  \ missed , \nmisunderstood or having to be repeated.  Even if a captain has a well-founded\
  \  expectation of \nwhat will eventuate, the non-flying pilot should be allowed\
  \ to read a QRH checklist fully and \nwithout interruption . \nFinding  \nThe captain's\
  \ predetermination of what was going to be required to get the landing \ngear down\
  \ and locked interfered with the proper following of the QRH  checklist ; \nnevertheless,\
  \ all of the items were covered.  \n \n \n  \nReport 10 -010 \n<< Page 31 >>"
