","0.0","20.0","The pilots incorrectly assumed that the nose landing gear was down and locked based on the false green verification light, leading them to disregard further warnings. ""The false green light on the verification system misled the pilots of ZK-NEB into believing that the nose landing gear was fully down and locked"" (5.5). This assumption was a critical factor in the incident.
","0.0","6.667","While the report does not explicitly mention a lack of training, the pilots' actions suggest a possible gap in training regarding the handling of false indications and the importance of verifying gear status through external checks. ""The pilots' CRM training covered general problem-solving techniques, but in this case they did not use all of the available resources"" (4.43).
","5.774","3.333","There is insufficient information in the report to suggest that a lack of training and familiarity with equipment contributed to the incident.
","5.774","16.667","The pilots did not fully utilize CRM principles, such as effective communication and use of all available resources, which could have helped them better assess the situation. ""The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position"" (5.10). Additionally, the flight attendant was not informed about the abnormal situation, which could have affected the emergency preparedness (4.43, 4.45).
","2.887","15.0","The pilots did not adhere to the safety procedures as they disregarded the aural warnings and did not perform a go-around, which would have given them more time to assess the situation. ""Pilots must respect warnings. In this case, the pilots should have responded by performing a go-around"" (5.9).
","0.0","6.667","The report suggests that the airline's maintenance practices and response to reported defects may not have been sufficiently robust, which is indicative of organizational safety culture. ""Air Nelson amended its maintenance response to the contamination of the #2 hydraulic system"" (4.14), and ""the intermittent nature of these defects...might now be recognised as symptomatic of fluid contamination or an actuator defect"" (4.13).
","2.887","5.0","The incident highlights a failure in risk management, as the potential for false indications due to stray light was not recognized by the manufacturer. ""The manufacturer had not recognised the possibility of stray light activating the sensor"" (4.21).
","0.0","5.0","The Commission's recommendation for the Director of the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to work with Transport Canada indicates a need for improved regulatory oversight regarding the landing gear down-lock verification system. ""The Commission recommends that the Director of the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority work with Transport Canada to require the manufacturer to improve the reliability and dependability of the landing gear down-lock verification system"" (4.24).
","0.0","3.333","The pilots' situational awareness was compromised by the false indication of the landing gear's status, leading them to misinterpret subsequent warnings. ""The verification light indicated to the pilots that the nose landing gear was down and locked... This led them to disregard the landing gear warning horn and the ground proximity warning system alert"" (4.33).
","2.887","0.0","The report does not indicate that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the incident, as the focus was on the failure of the landing gear to extend and the subsequent actions of the pilots.
","0.0","15.0","The failure of the nose landing gear to extend was likely caused by debris from damaged seals within the actuator, which points to maintenance issues. ""The failure of the nose landing gear to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator"" (5.1).
","0.0","0.0","The incident did not involve issues related to the use of automation, as the problem was with the mechanical landing gear system and the verification process.
","0.0","0.0","Weather conditions did not play a role in the incident, as there is no mention of weather being a factor in the report.
","0.0","3.333","There was a lack of effective communication between the pilots and with the flight attendant regarding the abnormal situation. ""By not doing so, the pilots have no opportunity to express any doubt and resolve it"" (4.34), and ""The captain should have explained to the flight attendant the reason for the go-around"" (5.11).
