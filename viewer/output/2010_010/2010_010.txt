The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with  a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purp ose. 
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 30 September 2010 a Bombardier DHC -8-311 aeroplane ( often referred to as a Q300 or 
Dash 8) departed from Wellington International Airport on a scheduled flight to Nelson 
Aerodrome.  The aeroplane diverted to Woodbourne Aerodrome (Blenheim) because of poor 
weather at Nelson.  There were 2 pilots, one flight attendant and 43 pass engers on board.  
1.2. When the pilots  moved  the landing gear  selector lever to DOWN , the left and right  main 
landing gear legs  extended normally , but the nose landing gear  stopped before it had fully 
extended, probably because debris within the hydraulic fluid blocked a small orifice in the 
hydraulic ram (actuator) that extended and retracted the nose landing gear.  
1.3. The primary system that indicated  the status of the landing gear showed the pilots that the 
landing gear was "unsafe ", that the nose landing gear was not down and locked , and t hat t he 
nose landing gear forward doors were open . 
1.4. The pilots began working through a checklist to troubleshoot the problem.  The checklist  
directed the m to an independent verification system designed to show whether the  individ ual 
landing gear  legs were locked down .  That system showed the pilots 3 green lights, which 
verified  that all the landing gear was down and locked, in spite of the other indications that the 
nose landing gear  was not.  
1.5. The pilots assumed that there was a fault in one of the landing gear sensors and continued 
the approach t o land at Woodbourne i n the expectation that all of the landing gear was locked 
down .  On the final approach the landing gear warning horn sounded when  the pilots began to 
configure the aeroplane for landing by selecting the wing flaps to 15 degrees.  This warning 
horn was designed to alert the pilots that the landing gear was not safe.  A short time later the 
ground proximity warning system also alerted  the pilots that the landing gear was not locked 
down .  The pilots ignored both of these warnings in the belief that they had been  generated 
from a single  sensor that they assumed was faulty and had given them the original unsafe 
nose landing gear indication s. 
1.6. When the aircraft touched down and the pilot lowered the nose , the nose landing gear was 
pushed into the wheel well and the aeroplane completed the landing roll skidding on the nose 
landing gear doors.  Damage to the aeroplane was minimal and no-one was injured.  
1.7. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that other events 
involving the same  nose landing gear in the weeks preceding this incident had probably been 
caused by the same condition  that prevented the normal exte nsion , debris within the hydraulic 
fluid, but that that condition had not been identified as the cause of those previous events .  
The Commission also found that the primary landing gear indication system had shown 
correctly that the nose landing gear was n ot locked down, but the pilots had been  misled by 
the verification system .  The verification system was found to be  unreliable.   The Commission 
found that the pilots ought to have heeded  the aural warnings , which  sounded on the final 
approach , and should h ave abandoned th at landing attempt until the actual position of the 
nose landing gear had been determined .  Additional  findings related to crew resource 
managemen t (CRM) .  
1.8. The operator , Air Nelson  Limited , and the aeroplane manufacturer , Bombardier,  took a 
number of safety actions  to address issues raised in this report .  However, one safety issue 
had not been resolved, so the Commission made a recommendation to the Director of the 
New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to work with the Canadian author ities to require the 
manufacturer to improve the reliability of the landing gear verification system.  
1.9. Key lessons  arising from this inquiry were:  
 when critical systems begin  intermittently  to malfunction or behave abnormally, this is 
often  a precursor to t otal failure.  For this reason the diagnosis of these problems 
should be exhaustive  and multifaceted  

<< Page 2 >>
 Report 10 -010  the more a pilot knows about aircraft systems, the better armed they will be to deal 
with emergency and abnormal situations.  
 aircraft warning systems are d esigned to alert pilot s to abnormal conditions.  Alerts 
should not be dismissed without considering all other available information  
 pilots must retain sufficient knowledge of aircraft systems to deal with situations not 
anticipated by Quick Reference Handb ooks .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At 1730 on 30 September 2010 , the Civil Aviation Authority  notified the Commission of the 
incident .  The Commission opened an inquiry  under section 1 3 of the Transport Accident 
Investigation  Commission  Act 1990 . 
2.2. The Commission  approv ed the removal of the aeroplane from the runway before its  
investigator  in charge arrived on site the next morning.  Following an initial examination of the 
aeroplane  at Woodbourne , it was flown to the operator's maintenance and operation al base at 
Nelson  Aerodrom e on 1 October 2010.  
2.3. A field service representative of the manufacturer was based  at the operator's base  at the 
time and provided direct as sistance to the inquiry . 
2.4. On 5 October 2010 the Australian Tra nsport Safety B ureau  appointed an Accredited 
Representative to assist the Commission, as provided for by Annex 13 to the Convention on 
International Civil Aviation.  On 7 October the cockpit voice recorder was taken to the Bureau's 
laboratory in Canberra and the content downlo aded  and protect ed in accordance with 
Australian legislation .2  The involved pilots later assisted the Commission to prepar e a 
transcript of the recording . 
2.5. On 13 October 2010  the Transportation Safety Board of Canada appointed an Accredited 
Representative  who assist ed the inquiry  by supervis ing the examination of nose landing gear 
components  that had been returned under quarantine to the aeroplane manufacturer .  A 
specialist examination of the components was conducted at the facilities of the component 
manu facturers in Canada.  
2.6. On 14 March 2011 the  National Transportation Safety Board of the  United States appointed 
an Accredited Representative  who arranged the supervision of a specialist examination of 
some components that, under United States law , could only  be examined at the 
manufacturers'  facilities in the United States.3 
2.7. In April 2011 t he Defence Technology Agency  of the New Zealand Defence Force analys ed 
hydraulic fluid samples and some landing gear components for the Commission.  
2.8. The following processes also took place  during the inquiry : 
 interviews with the crew members  and discussions with operational and maintenance 
personnel from the operator  
 an analysis of the recorded flight data  
 comparisons with  nose landing gear operation s on other aer oplanes in t he operator's 
fleet 
 discussions and correspondence with the aeroplane and component manufacturers ' 
representative s in New Zealand and elsewhere  
 discussions with representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority  and Transport Canada  
 reviews of the safety occurrence databases in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and 
the United Kingdom for relevant occurrences . 
2.9. The Commission acknowledges  the assistance of the Defence Technology Agency, the 
Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada , the United 
States' National Transportation Safety Board , and the aeroplane and component 
manufacturers in this inquiry.  
2.10.  On 28 June 2012 the Commission approved a draft final report for circulation to interested 
persons for their comment.  Submissio ns were received from both pilots, Air Nelson, 
Bombardier Aerospace, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and 
the Transportation Safety Board of Canada on behalf of Transport Canada and Messier -Dowty

 3. Factual information  
3.1. History of the flight   
3.1.1.  At 1507 o n 30 September 2010 , a Bombardier Q300  aeroplane  departed Wellington  
International  Airport on a scheduled air transport flight to Nelson Aerodrome.  The aeroplane 
was registered ZK -NEB and operated by Air Nelson (the operator).  On  board were 2 pilots, one 
flight attendant and 43 passengers.  
3.1.2.  After  2 unsuccessful approaches at Nelson because of poor weather , the flight diverted to 
Woodbourne Aerodrome, near Blenheim .  The planned alternate aerodrome had been 
Christchurch, but the captain decided that conditions at Woodbourne were suitable . 
3.1.3.  At Woodbourne,  a long, straight -in visual approach was flown to runway 24 .4  After the  landing 
gear had been  selecte d DOWN , lights  (advisory indicators ) on the centre  instrument panel 
indicated that only the main landing gear  had locked down  (see Figure 1) .  The red "gear 
unsafe" light and the amber "door  open " light for the nose landing gear  were illuminated.  The 
amber light in the landing gear selector lever handle  was also illuminated , indicat ing that not 
all of the landing gear was in the position selected .  No other caution lights  were illuminated . 
3.1.4.  The captain commenced a go -around  and entered  the aerodrome circuit while the pilots 
assess ed the situation.   They advised the air traffic control ler (the controller)  that they had "a 
gear malfunction " and requested a "Local Standby " of emergency services .5  They did not 
inform the flight attendant of the reason for the go -around or give her any further information 
during  the remainder of the flight .6 
3.1.5.  The landing gear selector lever  was left in the DOWN position and the captain directed the first 
officer to begin  the "Landing gear fails to extend " checklist in the operator's customised QRH 
(see Appendix  1).  
3.1.6.  One item in the checklist was to check the verification lights  that were located under the 
landing gear alternate extension door (flap)  in the flight deck floor (see Figure 2).  As the first 
officer was about to perform this step, the captain said  to him , "You will find it's not the 
problem ".  The captain meant that he was not expect ing the light for the nose landing gear  to 
illuminate  and that he expected that they would have to carry out the alternate landing gear 
extension procedure.  
3.1.7.  However, the 3 verification lights (one for each landing gear leg) illuminated green when 
checked.  The captain, not expecting to see the light for the nose landi ng gear illuminated, 
twice interrupted the first officer's reading of the checklist, saying that not all of the landing 
gear legs were locked down.  The first officer continued reading from the QRH, which stated in 
part:  
If either the "Landing gear down an d locked advisory light" or the "Landing gear 
down verification light" is on, the gear is down and locked.  
Is at least one green light illuminated for each Gear Leg position?  
 YES - The gear is down and safe.  
 NO - carry out an Alternate Gear Extension.  
 
 
                                                        
4 The runway designation is the magnetic heading to the nearest 10 degrees.  
5 The d eclaration of a "Local Standby " means the aircraft has some defect, but a safe landing is expected.  The air traffic 
services unit is responsible for alerting emergency services.  Those services based on t he aerodrome will be brought to a 
state of readiness .  Off-airport services are notified, but would not normally respond (AIP New Zealand, p.ENR 1.15 -12). 
6 Communications between the crew members and with air traffic control, and flight deck sounds, were obtained from 
the cockpit voice recorder.

Q300 flight deck, centre instrument panel  
3.1.8.  Even though they now had 3 green lights, the first officer asked whether they should fly by the 
control tower to allow the controller to check the landing gear position  visually .7  The captain 
declined to do this,  saying , "A green is a green ".  The y informed the control ler that the landing 
gear was now down , and were then cleared to land.   While on the downwind leg  of the circuit , 
the captain asked to check the  verification lights again , and both pilots  saw 3 green lights.  
3.1.9.  When the Q300 flew past the tower on the go -around, the controller was on the telephone 
advising adjacent air traffic control sectors of the situation and arranging the aerodrome 
emergency response.  The controller was also co -ordinating a following arrival, so he did not 
look up to check the position of the landing gear.  W hen the Q300 was on final approach the 
second time, he used binoculars to check the landing gear and at that distance it appeared to 
be down.  
3.1.10.  When the first officer selected the wing flaps to 15 degrees , the landing gear warning horn 
sounded.8  The horn so unds if the flaps are set to 15 degrees or more and any landing gear 
leg is not down and locked.  The captain was about to suggest that the circuit breaker that 
provide d power to the horn could be pulled, but the first officer suggested that he disregard 
the horn as the aeroplane was now only 600 feet above the ground.  The horn continued to 
sound until after the landing.  
 
                                                        
7 An external observer could have reported the landing gear position, but could not categorically  confirm  that the landing 
gear was locked down.   
8 Flight parameters were obtained from the flight data  recorder .  See paragraph 3.2.5.

3.1.11.  At about 2 00 feet above ground, after the pilots had selected the wing flaps to 35 degrees for 
landing, the ground proximity warning system  voice alert , "Too low gear ", sounded.9  This alert 
warns of unsafe terrain clearance when  one or more landing gear legs are  retracted .  The first 
officer quickly said, "Don't worry about it.  Too late", meaning they were about to land so it was 
too late to be looking for the circuit breaker to silence the alert .  The captain made no  
comment.  The first officer said later that, as the runway was in sight, there had been no risk 
of a collision with terrain, but he had felt uneasy.  This alert also continued until after the 
landing.  
3.1.12.  Both pilots said the aural warnings were  a distract ion during the  final approach , but because 
they had 3 green verification lights they were confiden t that all of the landing gear was down .  
They each  suspected  that the advisory indicat ors and aural warnings were caused by a single 
defective proximity s ensor  that senses the nose landing gear  position , so they reasoned that 
as the verification lights show ed that the nose landing gear  was locked down, the aural 
warnings could be ignored . 
3.1.13.  The flight attendant heard and recognised the sound of the landing gear warning horn .  She 
also heard the "Too low gear " alert.  She had heard the same voice alert s on other flights , but 
they had always been silenced  quickly .  When  the "too low gear " alert continued, she looked 
from her seat to see that the left main landing gear was down  and asked a passenger to 
check the right main landing gear .  As both  main landing gear legs  appeared to be locked  
down, she felt that all she could do was reassur e some passengers who had heard the 
warnings that everything was al l right , alth ough she remained puzzled by the alerts . 
3.1.14.  At 1710 t he aeroplane landed on runway 24 .  After the main landing gear  had touched down  
and the captain went to lower the nose , he realised that the nose was going lower than normal 
and that the nose landing gear  might not be extended.  He progressively applied full aft 
elevator to cushion the nose touchdown and commenced wheel braking .  The high wing 
design of the Q300 is such that the propellers do not contact the ground when the aeroplane 
is landed without the nose landing gear  locked down, if the wings are kept level.  
                                                        
9 The aeroplane was equipped  with the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, which includes the "basic " ground 
proximity warning modes , of which one is the mode referred to.

 Report 10 -010 3.1.15.  The flight attendant heard  unusual scraping noises during the landing, but she got no sense 
that the landing might not be under control.  At no stage did she fe el a need to instruct 
passengers to k eep their heads down or that a n emergency evacuation  might follow .  She did 
not think that t he floor angle  after landing, which was 3 degrees nose down, was particularly 
unusual . 
3.1.16.  The controller  watch ed the landing  and thought that the nose landing gear  was collapsing 
after the aeroplane landed .  He immediately cleared the assembled aerodrome emergency 
vehicles , which had responded to the Local Standby request,  onto the runway.  
3.1.17.  The captain chose not to initiate a n emergency ground evacuation, but instruct ed the first 
officer to shut down the engines and then made the cabin announcement , "Remain seated ".  
The pilots then  switched off all electrical power , which  silence d the aural warnings.  
3.1.18.  After the engines had been shut down t he captain went into the cabin , brief ly expla ined what 
had happened and directed the  flight attendant  to disembark  the passengers  immediately .  
No-one was injured  and t here was no fire.  
3.2. Aircraft information  
3.2.1.  The Q300 , or model DHC -8-311, is a Bombardier Aerospace development of the de H avilland 
Canada model commonly called the "Dash 8 ".  It is a high -wing , pressurised aeroplane 
powered by 2 turbo -prop engine s.  The aeroplane  has a crew of 2 pilots and , typically,  one 
flight attendant  and seats for 50 passengers .  The type certif ication  authority for the Q300 is 
Transport Canada.  
3.2.2.  The o perator had a fleet of 23 Q300 aeroplanes that had entered service between July 2005 
and June 2009.  At the time of the incident Bombardier had a service representative based 
with the operator.  ZK-NEB had be en manufactured in October 2005 and entered service with 
the operator in November that year.  At the time of the incident it had accrued 10  969 flight 
hours and 13  340 cycles . 
3.2.3.  According to the operator's records, the aeroplane had been maintained in accordance with 
the approved maintenance programme.  The previous scheduled maintenance  had been a 
"3A" check that was completed on 2 9 September 2010.10  During a 3A check , the entire  nose 
landing gear  assembly is visual ly inspect ed and lubricat ed, and the nose landing gear  doors 
are checked for full and free movement.  The steering assembly is also inspected, lubricated 
and operated .  The next annual maintenance review was due on 8 Oc tober 2010.  
3.2.4.  On 30 September 2010 the only deferred maintenance was rectification of an inoperative 
stick -pusher .11  Deferment of t hat task was p ermitted  and it did not affect the incident.  
3.2.5.  The aeroplane was fitted with a Honeywell solid -state flight data recorder.  Data relevant to the 
incident flight was downloaded at the operator's maintenance base and analysed for the 
Commission by the Transp ortation Safety Board of Canada.  
3.2.6.  A Honeywell solid -state cockpit voice recorder with a 2 -hour recording duration  was also fitted .  
The recorder was taken to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau in Canberra where the 
incident flight recording was downloaded.  The 2 pilots assisted the Commission in confirming 
the transcript of the recording.

 Hydraulic system  
3.2.7.  Hydraul ic power to operat e various items  is provided by 2 independent systems .  The #2 
hydraulic system powers the landing gear and nose  wheel steering.  Filters in the pressure and 
return lines remove foreign debris  from the hydraulic fluid.  The fluid is usuall y analysed once 
a year by drawing samples from  the low point of each  reservoir .12 
Landing gear description  and operation  
3.2.8.  The Q300 has a retractable, tricycle landing gear.  The nose landing gear  retracts forward into 
the fuselage nose.  Figure 3 shows some of the nose landing gear  components referred to in 
this report . 
3.2.9.  The landing gear operation is controlled by  moving  the landing gear selector lever  on the 
centre instrument panel  to the UP or DOWN position.  This sends a n electrical signal to the 
appropriate solenoid of the landing gear selector valve , which pressurises the hydraulic lines  
to the landing gear . 
3.2.10.  The nose landing gear  is enclosed by 2 sets of doors when retracted.   The forward doors are 
operated hydraulically and the rear doors are me chanically linked to the landing gear leg.  
When the landing gear selector lever is moved to DOWN, hydraulic pressure is applied 
simultaneously to:  
 the door actuator, to open the forward doors  
 the drag strut actuator, to release the up-lock 
 the nose landin g gear  extend/retract actuato r. 
3.2.11.  Electrical ly controlled  and m echanical sequence valves ensure that the components move in 
the correct order.  Once the nose landing gear  is locked down, the forward doors close , but the 
rear doors remain open . 
3.2.12.  The nose landing gear actuator has a dual -acting steel piston that slides inside an aluminium 
alloy cylinder.  The piston head has a black elastomer inverted "T"- seal, with a black Teflon 
back -up ring on either side.13,14  Hydraulic fluid is directed throug h a restrictor to either the 
"up" or "down " port of the actuator.  Figure 4 is a simplified "exploded " view of the nose 
landing gear extend/retract actuator.  
3.2.13.  Nose landing gear actuators are subject to "on-condition " maintenance and can be repaired or 
overh auled by approved organisations only.  Air Nelson did not hold the required approvals for 
working on the actuators, so they were sent to an approved organi sation for repair and 
overhaul.  Therefore, Air Nelson staff did not know the usual condition of pist on seals and 
rings when they were replaced.  The actuators sent previously by Air Nelson for repair had 
been replaced primarily because of mechanical defects, such as loose rod ends.  
3.2.14.  A Proximity Switch Electronics Unit monitors a number of functions , inclu ding the positions of 
the landing gear doors, the landing gear up -locks and down -locks, the engine power levers and 
the wing flaps selector lever.  The Unit controls the operating sequence of landing gear doors 
and hydraulic actuators, and activates the la nding gear warning horn.  The Terrain Awareness 
and Warning System also receive s information about the position of wing flaps and landing 
gear from the Unit.15  
 
                                                        
12 The fluid type used was Skydrol . 
13 The seal set was manufactured by Greene Tweed Aerospace Engineering and consisted of the seal, part number 
7215MT -952, and 2 back -up rings, part number 7215MT -P3. 
14 Teflon  is the DuPont Co. brand name for a polytetrafluoroethylene product.  This material is well known for its low -
friction, non -stick, non -wetting properties.

Q300 nose landing gear  
3.2.15.  When the landing gear is locked down, the Unit signals the respective green "gear down " 
advisory lights above the landing gear selector lever to illuminate and the red "gear unsafe " 
lights to extinguish.  The hydraulically operated landing gear doors are then signalled to close , 
and once they have closed the amber "door open " lights extingui sh.  If the position of any of 
the landing gear legs does not match the position of the landing gear selector lever, the amber 
light in the lever handle and the appropriate red "gear unsafe " light on the advisory panel 
illuminate.  
3.2.16.  Two separate down -lock pr oximity sensors in the nose landing gear must agree before the 
Proximity Switch Electronic s Unit logic determines that the leg is locked down.  Therefore, one 
faulty nose landing gear down -lock sensor can cause the Proximity Switch Electronics Unit to 
dete rmine that the nose landing gear is not locked down.  The Electronics Unit determine s the 
status of the landing gear and send s the appropriate signal : to illuminate the advisory lights 
above the landing gear selector lever; to the landing gear warning horn ; and to the ground 
proximity warning system.

3.2.17.  A taxi light is mounted on the right of the nose landing gear  strut.16  The operator's normal 
procedure was for it to be switched on immediately after the landing gear selector lever had 
been  put to DOWN.  The light would then be on before the nose landing gear  had fully 
extended.  
Down -lock verification system    
3.2.18.  The down -lock verification system provides an independent confirmation that the landing gear 
is locked down.  For the nose landing gear , a directional light is attached above the left side of 
the drag strut  (see Figure 5).  The light is activated by t he switch under the alternate extension 
door in the flight deck  floor.  If the nose landing gear  down -lock is engaged, the light shine s 
through a small hole in the down -lock link at the rear of the strut and falls onto a photo -
transistor sensor on the opposite wall of the wheel well .  The sensor then activate s the forward  
green  light in the floor compartment.  If the nose landing gear is not locke d down, the light 
path is blocked and the light should not illuminate .

 Report 10 -010 3.2.19.  The main landing gear  down -lock verification is similar.  The electronic controls for the 
verification  system are located in the cabin  and are therefore protected from moisture .  The 
Minimum Equipment List  allow s flight with the nose landing gear  verification light inoperative 
but not th e lights for the main landing gear . 
3.2.20.  A Bombardier service letter17 that explained  the primary (advisory) and alternate (verification) 
means of indicating  the down and locked position of the landing gear included the following, 
under the heading "Operator Action ": 
Upon completion of a normal extension sequence, if one or more of the three 
gear 'safe' lights are not on, or if one or more of the three gear 'u nsafe' lights 
illuminate, the Alternate Downlock Indication must be consulted for landing 
gear status verification.  
… illumination of the appropriate gear locked down (green) by either the 
primary or alternate indication system is confirmation that the lan ding gear is 
down and locked.     
Alternate landing gear extension  
3.2.21.  If the landing gear does not extend with the normal system, an alternate method can be used  
(see Appendix) .  The alternate  landing gear extension controls are:  
 the main landing gear up-lock release handle behind the alternate release door in the 
flight deck ceiling above the co-pilot's seat  
 the nose landing gear up-lock release handle under the alternate extension  door (flap) in 
the floor by the co-pilot's seat (see Figure 2 ). 
3.2.22.  By o pening the  overhead  door to  access the main landing gear alternate release handle , a 
mechanica l connection  activates a bypass valve that connects the pressure and return lines of 
the landing gear hydraulic system.  The landing gear up-lock release handles are  attached to 
the up-locks by cables.  When the handles are  pulled, the landing gear leg s should then  lower 
freely. 
Non-normal and emergency checklists  
3.2.23.  A QRH provides abbreviated information taken from the approved aircraft flight manual.  It is 
intended to  assist pilots to verify that the proper flight manual actions have been carried out 
when dealing with non-normal and emergency situations.  The preface to the Bombardier 
Q300 QRH was typical in stating (Bombardier, 2009, p.i, ii):  
It is the operator's res ponsibility to ensure the checklists are applicable to their 
type of operation.  In the event of an inconsistency between any checklist and 
the approved [aircraft flight manual], the [aircraft flight manual] takes 
precedence.  
Pilots must be aware that chec klists cannot be created for all conceivable 
situations and are not intended to preclude good judgement.  In some cases 
deviation from the checklists may, at the discretion of the [pilot in command], 
be necessary…  
The Non-normal /Emergency checklist assumes  that if an indicating light 
associated with a system is not illuminating, the integrity of the bulb is checked 
prior to referring to the checklist.

Figure 5 
Down -lock verification system  
3.2.24.  The Bombardier flight manual and QRH had an "Alternate gear extension " procedure to use in 
the event the landing gear did not extend normally . 
3.2.25.  Air Nelson  published its own QRH , which had an  additional  procedure for "Landing gear fails to 
extend ". This procedure  began by  checking that th e flight deck had been correct ly configur ed 
for normal extension of the landing gear before directing the pilots to perform the alternate 
gear extension procedure.  Part of this  additional procedure directed the pilots to check the 
status of the down -lock verification lights .  Air Nelson said that th is procedure had been 
developed as a result of  Bombardier 's service let ter.18  If, for example , the pilots had not seen 
3 green verification lights, Air Nelson's  additional procedure  would then have  led to the same 
alternate gear extension procedure  as in the Bombardier QRH . 
3.2.26.  The pilots had covered the "Landing gear fails to extend " and "Alternate gear extension " 
procedure s in the flight simulator phase of their Q300 conversion training.  The alternate 
landing gear extension actions are performed by the pilot who sits in the right seat  (normally a 
first officer) .  The captain had completed his conversion  training flying from the left seat , but 
had also operated as a training captain on the Q300 in the right seat and was familiar with  the 
procedure . 
3.2.27.  The manufacturer stated that the Q300 "can safely land with the nose [landing] gear 
retracted " and with all of the landing gear retracted.19  The operator's QRH recommended that 
pilots only consider an emergency evacuation for a landing with one main landing gear leg 
retracted , because that configuration presented  more risk . 
3.3. Incident  troubleshooting  
3.3.1.  On both approaches to Nelson the landing gear had operated normally, and it had been 
retracted while the flight was holding above Nelson between the approaches.  T he aeroplane 
had been  in cloud for most of the incident flight , but the pilot s had not seen any  airframe icing .  
Therefore i cing was discounted as a cause of the nose landing gear  not extending.

 Report 10 -010 3.3.2.  After the aeroplane nose was lifted by crane , the nose landing gear  extended under its own 
weight and was pushed rearwards into the locked  down position.  The wheels were at a slight 
angle, but there was no sign that mechanical binding or an obstruction had prevented normal 
extension.  The damage was confined to the forward nose landing gear  doors and the 
surrounding skin, and a radio antenna on the lower fuselage (see Figure 6).  The aeroplane 
was towed to the apron  about 5 hours after landing . 
3.3.3.  The next day the nose landing gear  was jacked clear  of the ground.   When the down -lock was 
released and the nose landing gear  moved about 300 millimetres forwards in the direction of 
retraction , the verification lights again gave a false  down -and-locked indication  for the nose 
landing gear .  The taxi light was off for this test, but it was carried out in bright sunlight on a 
light-coloured apron.  
3.3.4.  Later the same day the aeroplane was flown with the landing gear down to the operator's base 
at Nelson.  The re it was placed on jacks in a hangar and connected to a ground rig.  The 
ground rig is used to pressurise the hydraulic syste ms without starting the engines, to enable 
landing gear retractions and extensions , and for other hydraulic system maintenance . 
3.3.5.  Many satisfactory extension -retraction cycles of the landing gear were undertaken using the 
normal system, but after a while the nose landing gear  movement became slow and variable.  
On some occasions the nose landing gear  stopped when only  half-extended, and on others it 
paused during extension.

(photograph  courtesy of Royal New Zealand Air Force)  
3.3.6.  The nose landing gear  actuator, drag strut actuator and landing gear selector valve were 
removed for further inspection.  The nose  wheel  steering manifold assembly was also 
removed.  An initial examination showed that the hydraulic fluid was contaminated with 
unidentified black specks.  No contamination was found in the similar components of the 
main landing gear .  The ground rig was elimi nated as the source of the contamination.  

Report 10 -010 
<< Page 15 >>
 3.3.7.  After the hydraulic lines were cleaned, the nose landing gear  was re installed (apart from the 
forward doors) using  replacement components.  Extension and retraction tests were then 
carried out with no further fault s found.  
3.3.8.  The operator analysed hydraulic fluid samples from each aeroplane annually.  The most recent 
samples from ZK -NEB had been  taken on 4 September 2010 , 16 days before the incident.  
The analysis  report  stated the fluid was "in good condition ". 
Other  incidents  
3.3.9.  A month before this incident  a flight crew wrote in the maintenance log for ZK -NEB that after 
selecting the landing gear UP, the position indicat ors showed that the nose landing gear had 
not retracted.  The pilots extended the landing gear and r etracted it again, after which correct 
indications were obtained .  The landing gear operation remained normal for the rest of that 
day, so no further maintenance action was taken.  
3.3.10.  On 10 September 2010, 20 days before this incident, a flight crew reported t hat the nose 
landing gear  on ZK -NEB was very slow to retract after 2 take -offs, with the position  indicat ors 
showing that the nose landing gear  doors had not closed.  At the operator's base , a series of 
landing gear retraction s and extension s was carried out and a defect was confirmed, although 
it was described as "mainly slow and inconsistent extensions ".  The maintenance team 
replaced t he nose landing gear  door solenoid sequence valve, but the defect remained.  The 
nose landing gear  door mechanica l sequence valve was then  replaced and the nose landing 
gear actuator bled of air.  After 30 successful retract -extend cycles, the nose landing gear  
operation was considered satisfactory and the aer oplane was returned to service.  
3.3.11.  In 199 5 a different New  Zealand airline had to use the al ternate procedure to extend the nose 
landing gear  on a Dash 8 -100 aeroplane , which landed uneventfully .20  Whether an attempt 
was made to cycle the landing gear  is not known.  The Dash 8 -100 preceded  the Q300, but 
the nose landing gear  actuator s were the same part.  The defect was caused by pieces of the 
actuator seal restricting the hydraulic fluid flow through one of the actuator orifice s.  The 
cause of the seal failure was not determined.  
3.3.12.  On 12 March 2012 the flight crew of a Dash 8 -100 aeroplane operated in Papua New Guinea 
carried out an alternate extension of the landing gear following a loss of #2 hydraulic system 
pressure.21  The nose landing gear did not extend initially.  However, the verification light 
indicated tha t the nose landing gear was locked down, even though an air traffic controller 
confirmed that it was retracted and the doors were closed.  The verification system used in the 
Dash 8 -100 uses a fibre -optic path from the light sensor to the down -lock green l ight, and the 
taxi light is located above the aeroplane nose, outside the nose wheel well.  This incident was 
still under investigation when this report was published.  
3.4. Tests and defect rectification  
Down -lock verification  system  
3.4.1.  The complete verification s ystem from  ZK-NEB w as tested for the Commission by the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada.  The general condition and proper construction of the 
assembly were found to be satisfactory.  All tests , including the circuit performance with the 
sensor immersed in water,  were satisfactory .  The Transportation Safety Board r eported  that: 
the most likely cause of the [ false  down and locked indication] was a light 
source producing sufficient ambient light to activate the circuit .  Tests 
conducted by Bombard ier seem to indicate that the most likely source of light 
was the taxi light which is located on the nose [landing ] gear . 
3.4.2.  Bombardier had conducted its own tests , which  revealed  that false  nose landing gear  down -
lock indications  could occur if the taxi ligh t was switched on during landing gear extension.

 Report 10 -010 The tests  showed that  as the nose landing gear was extending , the verification light  in the 
cockpit illuminate d as the t axi light passed level with the top of the light sensor in the nose 
wheel well, extinguished again once the gear had made about two-thirds  of its travel, then 
illuminated again once the nose landing gear was down and locked (as it was designed to do).   
That finding was confirmed in tests conducted by the Commis sion.  
3.4.3.  Bombardier s aid that this problem  had not been  foreseen when it moved the taxi light from 
above the nose cone , where it had been fitted  on earlier models of the Dash 8, to the nose 
landing gear  strut  on the Q300.   The flight manual and QRH were later amended to require the 
taxi light to be switched off  before checking the verification lights . 
3.4.4.  During the troubleshooting of this incident, false  down -and-locked indication s were seen for 
the right main landing gea r as well.  The electrical connectors were cleaned and treated with a 
water  repellent , but the defect recurred .  A chafed wire  was found to have been the cause . 
3.4.5.  On 14 November 2010 the operator added daily in -flight checks of the verification system to 
supplem ent the daily ground checks it already performed.  During 2011 the  operator had 7 
reports of false  landing gear position i ndications in  flight.  None involved the nose landing 
gear, but in one case the indications for b oth main landing gear  legs were false .  Flight in 
moist conditions was a common factor.  In each case the defect was rectified by cleaning the 
sensors and connectors and applying a water repellent.  The aeroplane maintenance manual 
already contained advice on this issue.  
Landing g ear selector  valve  
3.4.6.  The landing gear selector valve was examined by the manufacturer, Eaton Aerospace , under 
the supervision of an investigator from the United States National Transportation Safety Board 
on behalf of the Commission .  The valve passed all but one functi onal test, with o ne internal 
leakage test  just outside tolerance.  The investigating group considered  that the result was 
consistent with an in -service part and had not affect ed the valve's functionality.  
3.4.7.  The valve  was disassembled and no anomaly was found .  The remaining hydraulic fluid in the 
valve was assessed  as Class 10, which  did not meet the fluid cleanliness standard of Class 8 
or lower .22  
Nose landing gear  actuator, drag strut actuator  and steering manifold  
3.4.8.  The nose landing gear  actuator, drag strut actuator and the nose  wheel steering manifold 
were examined by their manufacturer, Messier -Dowty, under the supervision of the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada on behalf of the Commission.  No  defect s were found 
with the drag str ut actuator or the steering manifold .23 
3.4.9.  According to Messier -Dowty, the nose landing gear  actuator had not been disassembled 
previously and the seals were those installed at manufacture in 2003 .  At the time of the 
incident the actuator had comp leted 13 340  cycles .  The manufacturer estimated  that the 
global fleet mean  time between unscheduled removal s was approximately 30 000 cycles.24 
  
                                                        
22 The applicable standard was National Aerospace Standard 1638.  
23 Messier -Dowty report ES R00574 -8, 11 February 2011.  
24 The number of cycles for the nose landing gear actuator would likely be slightly higher than this , because some 
extensions and retractions do not involve a landing, e.g. missed approaches, go -arounds and training .

3.4.10.  The nose landing gear  actuator could be fully extended and retracted by hand without 
excessive force or binding.  However, on disassembly fluid contamination was noted and 
minor wear marks were seen on the piston head.  Black debris was found on the inside of the 
UP restrictor.  The dimensions of the actuator met production specifications.  A n analysis of 
residual fluid and debris determined that the hydraulic fluid was of t he correct type and that 
the contaminants were a range of metals, predominantly aluminium, and a  black, organic 
material with characteristics consistent with those of Teflon.  
3.4.11.  The piston seal and one of the seal back -up rings had damage that the manufacturer 
considered rare (see Figure 7).  An analysis indicated that the seals and back -up rings were 
genuine parts and had been fitted in the correct order.  Messier -Dowty stated that nose 
landing gear  actuators had seldom leaked fluid or sustained  seal damage like that found in 
this actuator , and their  specifications had not been changed.  
3.4.12.  The Messier -Dowty report concluded that the seal deterioration and contamination were the 
result of hydraulic system contamination.  It did not specifically addre ss the cause of the 
actuator failing to extend the nose landing gear, but implied that a particle of contaminant had 
blocked a n integral  port and prevented proper actuator operation.  
3.4.13.  Sections of the seal and the damaged ring were sent by Messier -Dowty to t he seal supplier 
and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada for further examination.  These examinations 
found that the seal and back -up rings were genuine parts and had been installed in the 
correct order .  The seal supplier concluded that the seal dam age was a form of material 
fatigue known as "pock marking ", in which the first material to be damaged is carried away in 
the fluid and the uneven hydraulic pressures lead to accelerated damage to more material.  
Ultimately, a pock -marked seal will fail com pletely.  The seal manufacturer, noting the light 
scoring on the piston head and metal fines on the seal remnants, concluded that "hardware 
environment factors " had caused the seal damage.  The  seal manufacturer  did not consider 
the event systemic, in part  because of the history of successful operation across the Dash 8 
fleet.

 Report 10 -010 3.4.14.  The Transportation Safety Board of Canada  laboratory identified the presence of particles of a 
"7xxx-series aluminium alloy " on the seal .25  The report noted  that the nose landing gear  
actuator cylinder was 7075 alloy and that "the composition of most metal particles found on 
the back -up ring … is consistent with the major elements specified for this alloy ".26  The report  
concluded that : 
 no signs of incorrect seal and/or back -up rings ha ving been used in 
the hydraulic  system of the occurrence aircraft could be established.  
Materials of the occurrence parts matc hed materials of exemplar 
parts  
 signs of wear or mechanical damage were o bserved on the occurrence 
parts  
 the organic material dep osits on the filters  from hydraulic system tests 
were likely  debris from the seal and back -up rings  
 metal contamination, primarily with aluminium alloy particles, was 
found on the occurrence parts.  These particles were probably a result 
of wear of hydraul ic system components made of aluminium alloy.  
3.4.15.  The Transportation Safety Board of Canada also analysed 22 hydraulic fluid "patch " samples 
taken from various points in the hydraulic system of ZK -NEB, including the #2 hydraulic 
system pressure and return filt ers and residual fluid from the nose landing gear  actuator.  
Using various spectroscopy techniques, the laboratory identified a range of contaminants 
ranging from sub -micron to sub -millimetre in size, many of them non -metallic.  The analysis 
focused on the  metallic particles and concluded that:  
 microscopic metal -containing particles with chemical compositions 
generally consistent with metallic materials employed in aircraft 
construction were observed on the filters  
 a comparison filter [from another of the o perator's aeroplanes with a 
similar time in service] was in all aspects very similar to the 
corresponding test filter (#2 return) from the occurrence hydraulic 
system  
 it was not possible to determine the specific origins of the particles 
with the informati on provided for the examination.27 
3.4.16.  As the nose landing gear  actuator had been considered the likely defective component from 
the outset, the actuators from 2 other aeroplanes with similar times in service had been sent 
to Bombardier for comparison.  The cyl inder of one of these actuators was scored beyond 
limits, but the other actuator was serviceable.  
3.4.17.  These findings became known at about the time of another incident of a Q300 landing without 
its nose landing gear  extended.28  The operator then examined all nose landing gear  actuators 
that had more than 10 000 hours in service.  In nearly all cases, metal fines were found on 
the seals of the actuators, and some had seal damage or wear, but not to the extent of that 
seen on the actuator from ZK -NEB.

 Subsequen t incident  
3.4.18.  On 16 March 2011 hydraulic fluid samples t hat had been t aken earlier from the #2 hydraulic 
system of ZK -NEB were found to be contaminated with "a fine black sludge ".  The nose 
landing gear  actuator  (which  had been  installed after th e 2010 incident), the nose  wheel 
steering actuator and the nose landing gear  door actuator were replaced.  An inspection 
confirmed that the #2 hydraulic system reservoir was not contaminated , but the #2 system 
fluid was replaced.  Fluid  samples taken subsequently  have been clean.  
3.4.19.  The removed nose landing gear  actuator  was examined and found to be in a satisfactory 
condition, but there was some evidence of contamination in the steering actuator .  This 
contained a small piece from the actuator transfer tube seal  back-up ring , which appeared to 
have been nicked during installation.  
3.4.20.  The nose landing gear  door actuator was examined by its manufacturer , which  found th at th e 
aluminium cylinder was worn beyond limits and the white Teflon piston seal back -up rings 
were excessively worn (see Figure  8).  The door actuator had been installed as a new item 
when  ZK-NEB was manufactured .  Bombardier advised that between August 2005 and 
February 2011 the world Q300 fleet mean time between unscheduled removals  of the door 
actuator was 49  134 flight hours.  
3.4.21.  The operator removed the door actuators from 5 aeroplanes, based on their hours in service 
and higher , although acceptable,  levels of hydraulic fluid contamination.  Four actuators had 
cylinder wear that was o utside l imits  and the seals of 2 had major damage .  The aeroplane 
manufacturer and operator continue to examine causes of the high wear rate .  In the interim, 
the operator has instituted a finite life for the nose landing gear door actuators.   
3.4.22.  In April 20 11 the Defence Technology Agency co nduct ed further tests  for the Commission on 
the fluid samples and the nose landing gear  actuator seals .  The Agency's analysis methods 
included the use of electron microscopy and X -ray spectroscopy microanalysis of the seals and 
hydraulic fluid samples to determine the alloy composition of metal contaminants.  
3.4.23.  The Defence Technology Agency 's report on these analyses included reference to the 
following :29 
 fluid samples from the #2 hydraulic system reservoir were considered 
reasonably clean, compared with the appropriate st andard30 
 the 'black particulate material' , evident in samples taken from the #2 
system pressure and return filters and the right engine -driven 
hydraulic pump case drain  contained a polymer that might have been 
from the rubber used in the piston seal, but a definitive m atch could 
not be confirmed  
 the Agency was unable to make any specific categorisation of the 
particulate contaminant s present in the sample s. However, 'in general 
terms, the 2 predominant types … were organic (carbonaceous and/or 
fluorine) and aluminium -based (similar to 7000 series alloys) '.  The 
majority of the organic debris was likely from the seals and back -up 
rings.  The report noted that the aluminium -based debris may be 
consistent with wear and damage to the [nose landing gear ] actuator 
cylinder.  
3.4.24.  The report concluded that a range of metallic contaminants had been  identified, with 
aluminium -based debris predominant in some samples.  Organic debris was "likely to have 
been consistent with " the nose landing gear  actuator piston seal and back -up ring component 
materials.

3.5. Aerodrome information and air traffic control  
3.5.1.  Woodbourne Aerodrome is located about 6 kilometres west of Blenheim city in a broad river 
valley.  There is an unobstructed ap proach to the single, sealed runway and the right -hand 
circuit for runway 24 is  comfortably clear of terrain  for a Q300 -size aeroplane . 
3.5.2.  The sole air traffic controller on duty had more than  35 years' experience and had been 
controlling at Woodbourne since late 2001 .  On previous occasions he had visually checked 
the landing gear of aeroplanes when the pilots had  doubts about its position.  
3.6. Personnel information  
3.6.1.  The captain, who was the pilot flying the sector to Nelson, had flown the previous 2 sectors in 
ZK-NEB, but with a different crew.  The flight attendant had operated with the captain on the 
first sector that day then flown 2 sectors with another crew.  The first officer had also operated 
2 sectors with a different crew.  
3.6.2.  The captain had been  hired by the operator in 1994 and obtained an airline transport pilot 
licence (aeroplane) in September 1996.  He had obtained a Q300 aeroplane type rating in 
April 2007 , but had been the Q300 fleet manager s ince March 2007 .  In that capacity he had 
represe nted the operator at customer seminars hosted by Bombardier .  His total flight 
experience at the time of the incident was about 12 040 hours, of which about 1066 hours 
had been  on the Q300.  His previous flight crew competency and line checks had been  on 1 4 
September 2010.  He held a valid Class 1 medical certificate endorsed with the requirement 
to have half spectacles readily available.  
3.6.3.  The captain had had more than 13 hours free of duty, and said he had had adequate sleep, 
before reporting for duty at 06 20 on the day of the incident.  He  had operated one sector,  
then had a 3 -hour break before operating 2 more sectors, followed by a short break prior to 
the incident flight.  He said he had not fe lt tired when on the approach to Woodbourne.  He 
had worked in the office for 8 hours a day on the 2 days prior to 30 September.  He had had 
no duty on 27 September, having just returned from a meeting with Bombardier in Canada.  
He had flown about 90 hours in the previous 90 days, and 21 hours in the previous mont h. 
3.6.4.  The first officer had joined the operator in February 2009.  He was one of 2 Royal New 
Zealand Air Force junior pilots seconded to the airline during a period of reduced flying in the 
Air Force.  They did not have the minimum flight experience required by Civil Aviation Rules 
before commencing training as first officer s, but had been granted an exemption by the 
Director of Civil Aviation on 12 December 2008.31

<< Page 21 >>
 3.6.5.  The first officer held a commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) issued in November 2008.  He  had 
obtained a Q300 type rating in March 2009 and his total flight experience at the time of the 
incident was about 1167 hours, about 780 hours of which had been  on the Q300.  His 
previous flight crew competency and simulator checks had been  on 9 July 2010.  He  held a 
valid Class 1 medical certificate with no conditions, restrictions or endorsements.  
3.6.6.  The first officer had had more than 22 hours free of duty, and said he had had adequate 
sleep, before reporting for duty at 1015 on the day of the incident.  He had operated 2 sectors 
with a different crew before the incident flight.  He had had 10 hours of duty on 28-29 
September, with the night of 28 September spent away from his home base .  The 4 days 
before that had been free of duty, but included travel back fro m Australia.  He had flown about 
141 hours in the previous 90 days and 44 hours in the previous month.  
3.6.7.  The flight attendant had 5 years' experience with the operator.  She had accrued  a total flight 
time of about 2670 hours, of which about 2000 hours were on the Q300.  In the 30 days prior 
to the incident she had accrued about 113 duty hours and 28 flight hours.  Her previous flight 
attendant refresher course had been on 24 July 2010 and her previous line check had been  
on 27 July 2010.  
3.7. Crew resource management  
3.7.1.  CRM  has evolved since the 1970s from a concept for improving  the efficiency and co-
operation of flight deck crew only  to a practice involving all flight crew and other s outside  an 
aircraft who directly affect  the conduct or safety of the flight , such as air traffic controllers and 
maintenance personnel .  The practice spread to other transport modes and activities and is 
now embedded as an essential skill for teams working in safety -critical operations . 
3.7.2.  The definition of CRM  has changed as  the the ory and practice  have evolved , but in an aviation 
context  it is essentially "the effective use of all resources to achieve safe and efficient flight 
operations " (International Civil Aviation Organization , 1989, p.4 ).  The resources contemplated 
being used include equipment, a ll of its features a nd the procedures that optimis e its use; and 
people , whether on board as crew or not, and particularly  their knowledge and ability to assist 
with problem -solving .  In addition,  the t ime available to resolve a problem or abnormal 
condition can be a useful  resource . 
3.7.3.  The non-technical skills that enhance crew communication, co -operation and decision -making  
are essential components of CRM  training courses.   These courses impress upo n trainees the 
nature of human error and how individual attitudes and behaviour affect crew performance  
and the safety of flight operations . 
3.7.4.  The operator 's initial  CRM training for pilots and flight attendants emphasised the team 
aspects of airline operations.  Within 12 months of starting revenue flying, pilots and flight 
attendants attended a joint CRM training session that included, among other subjects, 
decision -making, abnormal situation management and crew communication.  Pilots learnt the 
technical aspects of individual abnormal checklists during the relevant simulator and line 
training, and crew co -ordination and communication aspects formed  "a large portion " of the 
joint refresher courses held for pilots and flight attendants every 2 years.  CRM aspects that 
were more relevant to command were covered during a first officer's upgrade training.  
3.7.5.  Annual refresher training for flight attendants covered all of the subjects of their initial training 
and any special items.  For 2010, a special item in the programme had been a presentation 
on ground accidents and unusual emergency evacuations  after, for example,  a landing gear 
failure to extend .  The flight attendant h ad not been rostered to attend that refresher training 
prior to the incident.   However, she and both pilots had completed refresher training in 
accordance with the operator's schedule.  
3.7.6.  The operator's standard procedure in the case of a prepared abnormal or  emergency landing 
was for the aeroplane captain to brief the flight attendant.  The briefing should cover the 
nature of the emergency, the captain's intentions, the time remaining and any special 
instructions, such as re -seating passengers to more favoura ble location s. 

<< Page 22 >>
 Report 10 -010 3.7.7.  Flight attendants are taught to carry out a silent review before each take -off and landing in 
order to be primed to deal with unexpected occurrence s.  The review covers the aerodrome at 
which they are operating and its local environment, the  need to be alert for anything unusual 
and the signals and commands for emergency situations, such as a ground evacuation .32

 4. Analysis  
4.1. The nose landing gear of the Q300 aeroplane did not fully extend when the pilots selected the 
landing gear  down  on approach to Woodbourne Aerodrome.  The reasons for this are 
discussed below, but the nose landing gear not fully extending is not the main concern.  The 
main concern is that the pilots thought it was down and locked when in fact it wasn't.  
4.2. There are a number of reasons why the nose landing gear  might fail to extend  fully using the 
normal system , which is why aeroplane s are  required to have  an alternative means of 
extension .  There are procedures and checklists to help the pilots to achieve this.  Howeve r, in 
this case one of the system s for checking that the landing gear was down and locked was 
poorly designed and gave the crew a false indication that the nose landing gear was down and 
locked.  The flight crew then continued the approach in the expectati on of  making  a normal 
landing.  
4.3. This report discusses the design of the verification system that false ly indicat ed that the nose 
landing gear was down and locked.  It also discusses whether, if the indication system had not 
been faulty , the crew could have succeeded in extending the nose landing gear  fully by 
alternative means.  
4.4. The pilots were justified in believing the  verification light  that showed that the nose landing 
gear was down and locked .  However , later  in the approach the aeroplane systems gave them 
another 2 alerts that the landing gear was not safe.  The report discusses the pilots' reaction s 
to th ose additional warnings .  The role of CRM  in dealing with such incidents  is also discussed . 
Nose landing gear extend/ retract actuator defect  
4.5. The nose landing gear actuator most likely jamm ed because pieces of the damaged piston 
seal and its back -up rings had blocked at least one of the internal ports.   After the landing gear 
selector lever had been placed to DOWN , the main landing gear locked down normally, 
showing that the electrical and hydraulic sub -systems worked correctly.  The nose landing gear 
up-lock had release d and the extend actuator had begun to extend the leg .  If the UP port had 
then  blocked, the  fluid on th at side of the dual-acting piston would have been prevented from 
returning to the reservoir , thereby creating a hydraulic lock  that would have prevented further 
movement of the actuator . 
4.6. The pieces of damaged seal were not the only co ntaminants  found in the system.   The 
analyses of the fluid by the Transport Safety Board of Canada and the Defence Technology 
Agency agreed broad ly on  the nature of the metallic particles, that their origin was most likely 
other components powered by the #2 hydraulic system, and that the organic compounds 
came from the seal and the back -up rings.  Aluminium was the predominant metallic debris, 
but the a luminium cylinder of the nose landing gear  actuator was not worn.  Therefore the 
metal came from elsewhere in the nose landing gear  system.  
4.7. In March 2 011 the nose landing gear  door actuator  cylinder was found to be worn beyond 
limits and to contain debris from its seal and back -up rings.  That actuator had not been 
removed from ZK -NEB after the September 2010 incident, because the previous routine 
analyse s of the hydraulic fluid had not caused concern for the condition of that or any other 
component.  
4.8. The wear on the  door actuator cylinder suggested that it was the source of much of the metal 
found on the extend/retract  actuator and other components in ZK -NEB.  A comparison with 
door actuators from other aeroplanes suggested this could be a fleet  issue , which  the 
manufacturer and operator are continu ing to investigate .  Th e Commission is recommending 
that the Director of Civil Aviation monitor the progress of those investigations and liaise with 
Transport Canada in order to produce acceptable corrective action s. 
4.9. Hydraulic fluid samples from ZK -NEB analysed  since the nose landing gear door actuator was 
replaced in March 2011 have been satisfactory.  

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 10 -010 4.10.  A confounding issue during the investigation, especially after the incident in February 2011, 
was the presence of metal fines on the nose landing gear actuator piston seals .  As Air Nelson 
had no experience of  disassembl ing the actuators, it did not know whether the condition of an 
actuator that had performed  10 000 cycles was similar to that of one that had reached  the 
average overhaul life of more than 30 000 cycles.  However, Messier -Dowty and the various 
examinations indicated  that metal fines were always present and a result of normal wear and 
tear.  
4.11.  The initiating cause of the seal damage was not conclusively determined.  A manufacturing 
defect or incorrect seating of the seal during the assembly of the actuator cannot be excluded.  
Having been damaged, the seal would have been progressively eroded by  normal hydraulic 
pressure fluctuations and by the larger metallic particles that contaminated the hydraulic fluid. 
4.12.  The nose  landing gear extend/retract actuator  has been a reliable component across the 
world -wide Q300 fleet.  The damage to the seals found  in this actuator is therefore considered 
to be unusual.  For this reason the manufacturer has not amended its maintenance 
requirements for the actuator, and the Commission concurs with this decision.  
4.13.  In the 5 weeks before this incident, 2 nose landing gea r defects on ZK -NEB were investigated 
and the aeroplane was released to service without  any definite cause s being found.  The 
intermittent nature of these defects, particularly the retraction event, might now be recognised 
as symptom atic of fluid contamina tion or an actuator defect.  Neither the nose landing gear 
actuator nor the door actuator was replaced.    
4.14.  Air Nelson amended its maintenance response to the contamination of the #2 hydraulic 
system to include replacement of the nose landing gear actuator a nd the nose landing gear 
door actuator, in addition to replacement of the filters and the #2 system fluid.  Air Nelson 
also put a finite life on the nose landing gear door actuators, pending the outcome of the 
investigation referred to above.  
4.15.  The on-condition  main tenance p rocess should pre vent the failure or degradation of a 
component from causing an operational incident by recognising th e imminent  or likely need to 
repair or replace  the component  before that happens.   System redundancies and non-normal 
procedures cater for m ost sudden failures, but the on-condition process is not intended to be 
one of "fit until failure ".  Pilot reports of unusual system  operation  are as much a part of on -
condition monitoring  as obvious defects, such as a leaking seal. 
4.16.  The maintenance response to reported defects is usually straightforward  when the cause s of 
the defect s are  obvious .  When the cause is not so obvious , or if the ma intenance manual 
lacks specific guidance,  troubleshooting will often follow the process  of elimination of 
potential causes , which may mean th e replacement of components .  That process, particularly 
where there is an intermittent defect, may appear to remedy  the defect , only for it to return 
later.   For this reason, maintenance action might i nitially fail to identify the true cause of a 
defect . 
Findings  
The failure of the nose landing gear  to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in 
the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within  the nose landing gear  extend/retract 
hydraulic actuator .  The debris probably  came from damaged seals within the 
actuator.  
The damage to the seals  within the extend/retract hydraulic actuator could have 
initially been caused by a manufacturing defect in the seal s or by  an incorrect 
assembly technique .  The damag e may have been exacerbated by debris in the 
hydraulic fluid that originated from excessive wear in another actuator in the system, 
the one that opened and closed the forward nose landing gear doors.  
 
Report 10 -010 
<< Page 25 >>
 Two instances of unusual operation of the nose landing gear had been  reported in the 
5 weeks prior  to th e failure  to extend at Woodbourne .  The cause of the earlier events  
was probably the same as that of the failure to extend.  
Reason for the f alse down -lock verification  
4.17.  When the pilots  moved  the landing gear selector lever to DOWN  on the approach to 
Woodbourne, the  "Landing ear Inop " caution light did not illuminate , but the  indicators on the 
landing gear panel told them that the nose landing gear was in an unsafe condition .  The u se 
of the "Landing gear fails to extend " procedure  in the Air Nelson QRH  was the appropriate 
action for the  pilots  to take .  The procedure  stated that if either the advisory indicator  on the 
forward panel or the verification light under the alternate extension flap w as green, the 
corresponding  landing gear leg was down  and locked .  The 2 indication systems were 
independent  of each other .  
4.18.  The text of the QRH removed any doubt  for the pilots .  It clearly stated that if either light was 
green , the relevant landing  gear leg was down and locked.   When the pilots saw the green 
verification light for all 3 landing gears, including the nose landing gear , the pilots  had every 
right  to believe the verification light, and halt the "Landing gear fails to extend " procedure . 
4.19.  The captain said that in his capacity as the airline 's flight operations representative at 
Bombardier customer seminars , he had heard the saying "a green is a green " used to 
emphasise the dependability  of the verification system.  His  comment that "a green  is a 
green ", made when he declined the first officer's suggestion to fly past the control tower and 
have the nose landing gear  position checked by the controller, reflected his confidence  in the 
verification system.   Most other pilot s would have conclude d at that point that all of the 
landing gear was down.   Notwithstanding that confidence , shortly afterwards he requested a 
second check of the verification light, and both pilots confirmed that it was  still green . 
4.20.  Clearly, the nose landing gear down -lock v erification had been false . That error was replicated 
the following day  during  ground  checks .  Laboratory testing confirmed that the verification 
sensor would be activated  if the taxi light was ON before the nose landing gear  had extended  
fully.  The operator's normal procedure was to s witch  the taxi light ON immediatel y after the 
landing gear selector lever was put to DOWN .  There was no reason to believe that the pilots 
on this flight had deviated from that p rocedure .  Therefore it was almost certain that the taxi 
light had been  ON when the verification lights  were checked  and that with the nose landing 
gear in the partially extended position, the bright taxi light caused the false  indication . 
4.21.  The cause of the false  indication the da y after the incident, wh ile the taxi light was OFF,  was 
not determined , but it could have  been  that the sunshine  reflected from the concrete apron 
was bright enough  to activate the sensor  that illuminated the green indicator light in the 
cockpit . The manufacturer had not recognised th e possibility  of stray light activating the 
sensor when the taxi light position was shifted from the external nose cone, where it had been 
on earlier Dash 8 models, to the nose landing gear  strut.  The  manufacturer issued a service 
letter in April 2011 and a dded a note to the QRH to remind pilots to ensure that the taxi lig ht 
was OFF when checking the verification lights . 
4.22.  The change to the QRH resolves the issue  of stray light from the taxi light causing a false 
indication.  However, the incident in New Guinea in March 2012, involving an aeroplane  that 
did not have the taxi light on the nose landing gear  strut , showed that the re must be other 
cause s for  false  indications.   Air Nelson  had identified at least 2 other causes: moisture 
ingress and the chafing of wires.  
4.23.  These defects and  reports of occasional false  in-flight  verification s suggest ed that  the 
reliability of the verification system for the Q300 (and Dash 8  series ) did not warrant the trust 
placed in it by the manufacturer . 

<< Page 26 >>
 Report 10 -010 4.24.  The Commission recommend s that the Director of the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority 
work with  Transport Canada to require the manufacturer to improve the reliability and 
dependability of the l anding gear down -lock verification system . 
Findings  
With the nose landing gear stuck in a partially  extended position, light from the taxi 
light was likely detected by the sensor for the down -lock verification system, causing it 
to give a false green light.  
The false green light on the verification system misled t he pilots of ZK -NEB into 
believing  that the nose landing gear was fully down and locked . 
The verification system for checking if the landing gear is down and locked on the 
Dash 8 series of air craft is not reliable enough  for pilots to place total trust in it when 
trying to establish the status of the landing gear.  
Other means of extending the nose landing gear  
4.25.  After the nose of ZK -NEB was lifted from the runway, the nose landing gear lowered u nder its 
own weight, which confirmed  that the up -lock had released .  The fact that the actuator then 
moved freely  indicated that it was no longer jammed , possibly because the partly extended 
wheels had been forced  back into the wheel well during the landin g.  That r everse actuator 
movement could have dislodged any debris in the actuator.  With th is possibility  and the 199 5 
incident  in mind , the Commission consider ed whether the nose  landing gear might have been 
exten ded by another method.    
4.26.  The false down -lock indication caused the pilots , in accordance with  the QRH , to stop the  
"Landing gear fails to extend " procedure .  Therefore they had no reason  to try the alternate 
extension procedure.  However, i t is probable that t hey would have tried that procedure if they 
had known  (for example,  from having asked the controller)  that the nose landing gear , in spite 
of the verification light showing otherwise,  was definitely not down.  
4.27.  During an alternate extension procedure, hydraulic pressure is equali sed within  the landing 
gear system .  Whether simply depressurising the hydraulic system would allow any debris to 
dislodge from the "retract " (up) restrictor would depend on the size of the debris and how 
solidly it was entrapped there .  The debris was likely to have be en forced into the orifice of the 
restrictor under  hydraulic pressure  as the nose landing gear tried to extend.  It is unlikely 
therefore that the debris would simply have fallen out when the hydraulic pressure was 
removed.  
4.28.  For the alternate extension proc edure to have succeeded, the debris would have to have 
dislodged, or as discussed earlier, been forced out by hydraulic fluid flowing through the 
restrictor in the opposite direction.  If the pilots had not been given 3 green verification lights , 
they woul d have gone straight to the alternate extension procedure.  There would therefore 
have been no opportunity for such a reverse flow of hydraulic fluid through the restrictor.  For 
this reason it is unlikely that the alternate extension procedure would have succeeded in 
extending the nose  landing gear  in this case.  
4.29.  The troubleshooting and the 2 earlier events had show n that the defect was intermittent.  The 
nose landing gear moved in the retract direction when the nose wheels were pushed back into 
the wheel w ell during the landing.  Therefore c ycling the landing gear up and then down again 
could have dislodged any debris caught in the actuator and allowed the nose landing gear to 
lock down.  However, the QRH did not at th at time provide  for the landing gear to  be cycled.  
4.30.  Air Nelson confirmed that its training followed the manufacturer's advice that the landing gear 
selector lever should not be moved following an unexpected landing gear condition, unless the 
QRH direct ed otherwise.  The reason given for this was that if the gear stops in an unsafe 
Report 10 -010 
<< Page 27 >>
 condition, one reason could be that the sequence of doors opening, landing gear extending 
and doors closing again is disrupted.  Cycling the landing gear in this case could cause 
damage such as driving the wheels int o out -of-sequence landing gear doors.  Therefore the 
pilots' decision not to cycle the landing gear selector lever was appropriate.  
4.31.  Since then the manufacturer has issued a service letter that  discusses  resetting the alternate 
extension system , if it has been used  without success , and situations when cycling the landing 
gear might be an option .  Such an action would be  a last resort  and at the captain's discretion . 
4.32.  Cycling the landing gear might be prudent for a situation where only one side of the main 
landing gear is down and locked , because there is a higher risk of an unsuccessful landing  
with that configuration .  In that case the captain has nothing to lose by cycling the landing 
gear.  If , however , both sides of the landing gear are down and locked and the nose landing 
gear is not, as in this case,  the captain would need to consider whether cycling the landing 
gear could exacerbate the problem.  The captain would have to choose between landing with 
only the nose landing gear retracted , or cycling the landing gear and potentially encountering a 
problem with the main landing gear  as well or instead.  
Findings  
Had the pilots known that the nose landing gear was not down and locked and then 
tried  the alternate extension procedure, th at acti on would have been  unlikely  to 
succeed because debris would probably still have been bloc king the restrictor within 
the hydraulic actuator . 
Assuming that the reason for the nose landing gear not fully extending was debris in the 
hydraulic fluid, it is possible that cycling the landing gear up and down again would 
have succeeded in getting all of the landing gear down and locked .  However , that 
action was not recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.  
The pilots ' responses to  the aur al warnings  
4.33.  The verification light indicated to the pilots that the nose landing gear was down and locked, 
and that conclusion was reinforced by the text in the QRH.  As the verification system was 
independent of the proximity sensors and relied simply on having an unobstructed light beam, 
the green light also strongly suggested that the advisory light on the landing gear panel must 
be wrong.  Both pilots said they therefore assumed that the landing gear status , as 
determined by the proximity sensor logic  and used by other systems , was wrong.  This led 
them to disregard the landing gear warning horn and the ground proximity warning system 
alert that sounded shortly before landing . 
4.34.  The captain said he had expected the aural warnings, but he omitted to forewarn the first 
officer.  A lthough each pilot said he had decided th at th e aural warnings were false, neither 
clearly stated this  to the other .  Warnings, especially ground proximity system warnings, should 
not be ignored  without the involved pilots agr eeing that the proposed action will be 
acceptable.   By not doing so, the pilots have no opportunity to express any doubt and resolve 
it. 
4.35.  The first officer later added  that, as the runway was in sight, there had been no risk of a 
collision with terrain.  Th at explanation suggested he had not interpreted correctly the cause 
of the active ground proximity warning mode .  The alert "Too low gear " refers to the aeroplane 
not being in the correct configuration for landing, rather than a n impending  collision with t he 
ground as such.  His further comment that he had been confident yet uneasy at the same time 
suggested that he may have been hasty in his response to the warnings . 
4.36.  The Proximity Switch Electronics Unit determines that the nose landing gear is locked down  
when both down -lock sensors signal that condition.  One faulty nose landing gear down -lock 
sensor could cause the Proximity Switch Electronics Unit to determine that the nose landing 

<< Page 28 >>
 Report 10 -010 gear is not locked down, and therefore the nose landing gear "unsafe " and "doors open " lights 
would remain illuminated.  These  were the indications seen in this incident.   Because the 
green verification light showed (falsely) that the nose landing gear was locked down, the pilots 
reason ed that a faulty sensor  was the cause . 
4.37.  A configuration warning, such as "too low gear ", is not considered by the system manufacturer 
to be a  hard warning, like "Terrain! Pull up! ", which requires a mandatory, immediate escape 
manoeuvre.  The normal response for a pilot is to correct the condition  causing the alert ; 
namely,  extend the landing gear .  However, by design these alerts occur late in an approach 
and as there will be  little time or height available , the best response is invariably to go ar ound 
and, when at a safe height, to review the sit uation.  
4.38.  The pilots said that they had had enough fuel to go around  again .  Had they done so, one 
would expect that they would  have asked the controller to report  the nose landing gear  
position , as the first officer had earlier suggested they do.  
4.39.  Had the controller said that the nose landing gear did not appear to be down, the pilots would 
have realised that the aural warnings were genuine.  It would  then  have been logical for them 
to disregard the (false) green verification lights  and go back to the "Land ing gear fails to 
extend " checklist .  This would  have directed them to perform the alternate extension 
procedure .  However , as mentioned above, that procedure would have been  unlikely to   
succe ed in this case, because the actuator was jammed.  
4.40.  A fly-by cannot confirm absolutely that a  landing gear leg is locked down, especially at night, 
but an observer can report the landing gear appearance.  In the case of the nose landing gear 
on the Q300, if the wheels appear down and the forward doors are c losed, th at is useful 
information, because th e Proximity Switch Electronics Unit must sense that the landing gear is 
down and locked  before it will signal the doors to close.  
4.41.  The pilots could have sought technical advice from the operator  and likely would have done so 
had they gone around in response to the aural warnings .  If it had been confirmed that the 
nose landing gear was not locked down, the checklist would have led the  pilots  to silence the 
potentially distracting warnings and they would have instr ucted the flight attendant to prepare 
the cabin for an emergency landing.  
4.42.  The operator later clarified the action it expected its pilots to take, including making use of an 
external observer, when there was a disagreement between landing gear position indi cations.  
4.43.  The pilots' CRM training covered general problem -solving techniques , but in this case they did 
not use all of the  available resources , in particular the use of external observers and  taking 
action that would give them  more time.   The f light attendant  demonstrated her alertness and 
initiative by check ing that th e main landing gear  was down  when she heard the warnings .  
However, she had not been told of the earlier abnormal gear indication  and her training told 
her not to interrupt the pilots a t a late stage in the approach , especially if only to tell them that 
the main landing gear  looked norma l. 
Finding s 
The aural warnings that not all of the landing gear was locked down were genuine 
warnings.  Pilots must respect warnings.  In this case, the pilots should have 
responded by performing a go -around, which would have given them more time to 
consider the situation . 
The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear 
position.  If they had asked the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing 
gear, it is likely th at th ey would have taken further action  in an  attempt to get the nose 
landing gear  locked down.  
 
Report 10 -010 
<< Page 29 >>
 Other crew resource management issues  
4.44.  The following further examples of crew interaction  are discussed as lessons for the better 
handling of abnormal situations : 
 the lack of information to the flight attendant  
 the carrying out o f the QRH checklist . 
Informing the flight attendant  
4.45.  Flight attendants are on board  aircraft primarily for the safet y of passengers.  The operator's 
CRM training emphasised the communication and co -ordination that should occur between 
the flight deck and flight attendant so that all of the crew are  properly informed of any matter 
that might affect the safety of the aeroplane and those on board, or affect the discharge of 
their respective duties.   Communication with flight attendants is particularly important for 
those who work alone in the cabin, as  with this operator.  
4.46.  The training for flight attendants includes  the prepar ation of the cabin and the advice to give 
passengers in the event that an emergency or abnormal landing is anticipated and the 
emergency evacuation of the aeroplane after landing.  The operator required its flight 
attendant s to carry out a silent self-brief before every take -off and landing so that they would  
be better prepare d for unexpected emergenc ies. 
4.47.  A go-around from a landing approach  is not common, but this flight attendant ha d been on 
board flights when this had occurred .  The captain did not advise her o f the reason for the go -
around , because soon afterwards he believ ed there was no problem  and a normal landing 
would follow .  However, the Commission thinks he ought to have done this.  I t would have 
taken just half a minute to explain  the situation t o her .  Under most circumstances that could 
be done using the  public address  system , thereby inform ing the passengers  at the same time .  
Being less accustomed than flight attendan ts to go -arounds, some passengers could be 
anxious , and information can dispel anxiety.  
4.48.  Had th is experienced flight attendant known what had led to the go -around, she might  have 
considered abnormal landing condition s and her s ilent s elf-brief  could have been more 
pertinent.  Even though she was unconcerned  by the continuing aural warnings , with 
knowledge of what had happened she would  have been better primed for action had the 
landing been  less favourable .  Then s he would have been justified in commanding the 
passengers "Head down, stay down " at the first sound and sign that the landing was not , in 
fact, normal.  
Finding  
The captain  should have  explained to the flight attendant the reason for the go -
around, even though he believed  that the situation had been resolved .  The flight 
attendant would h ave been better prepared should the landing have been less 
favourable.  
 
The carrying out of the QRH  checklist  
4.49.  Through his company appointment and participation in the manufacturer's seminars , the 
captain had considerable knowledge of the global Q300 operational experience, abnormal 
landing gear conditions, and the development of QRH checklists.  When the first officer 
advised him that the nose landing gear  appeared to be not down , the captain a nticipated that 
they would have to perform the alternate extension procedure.  

<< Page 30 >>
 Report 10 -010 4.50.  Perhaps it was t his anticipation  that led the captain to interrupt the first officer 's read ing of 
the QRH checklist.   In a couple of instances, the captain pre -empted the first officer 's 
responses , but between them all of the checklist items were covered . 
4.51.  The captain's comment while the first officer was  checking the verification lights  that they 
were  "not the problem " suggested a predetermination of the problem and interfer ed with the 
proper  following of the  checklist.  The first officer took the comment to mean th at he would 
see 3  verification lights , meaning all of the landing gear was down .  When he did see  3 green 
verification lights,  that indicated  to him that the nose landing gear advisory light s on the 
instrument panel were wrong .  The false  verification light s supported the first officer's 
interpretation of the captain's comment and probably  influence d his later belief that the aural 
warnings  were false. 
4.52.  However, the captain 's explanation was he did not expect to see a green verification light for 
the nose landing gear  and he expected that an alternate extension would follow .  Having 
interrupted the first officer's checklist responses, the captain was then surprised by hearing 
there were 3 green lights and he twice asked the first officer to confirm that.  The captain later  
asked for the verification lights  to be checked once more before they landed . 
4.53.  Unvoiced assumptions and doubts when faced with a problem are the antithesis of good crew 
communication and problem -solving.  Interrupting the reading of a checklist, especially one 
from the QRH , breaks the flow of the checklist, and can lead to items being missed , 
misunderstood or having to be repeated.  Even if a captain has a well-founded  expectation of 
what will eventuate, the non-flying pilot should be allowed to read a QRH checklist fully and 
without interruption . 
Finding  
The captain's predetermination of what was going to be required to get the landing 
gear down and locked interfered with the proper following of the QRH  checklist ; 
nevertheless, all of the items were covered.  
 
 
  
Report 10 -010

 5. Findings  
5.1. The failure of the nose landing ge ar to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the 
hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator.  
The debris probably came from damaged seals within the actuator.  
5.2. The damage to the seals within th e extend/retract hydraulic actuator could have initially been 
caused by a manufacturing defect in the seal s or by  an incorrect assembly technique .  The 
damage  may have been exacerbated by debris in the hydraulic fluid that originated from 
excessive wear in another actuator in the system, the one that opened and closed the forward 
nose landing gear doors.  
5.3. Two instances of unusual operation of the nose landing gear had been  reported in the 5 
weeks prior to the failure to extend at Woodbourne.  The cause of the earlier events was 
probably the same as that for the failure to fully extend . 
5.4. With the nose landing gear stuck in a partially  extended position, light from the taxi light was 
likely detected by the sensor for the do wn-lock verification system, causing it to give a false 
green light.  
5.5. The false green light on the verification system misled the pilots of ZK -NEB into believing that 
the nose landing gear was fully down and locked.  
5.6. The verification system for checking if t he landing gear is down and locked on the Dash 8 
series of aircraft is not reliable enough for pilots to place total trust in it when trying to 
establish the status of the landing gear.  
5.7. Had the pilots known that the nose landing gear was not down and locke d and then tried the 
alternate extension procedure, that action would have been  unlikely to succeed because 
debris would still have been blocking the restrictor within the hydraulic actuator . 
5.8. Assuming that the reason for the nose landing gear not fully extending was debris in the 
hydraulic fluid, it is possible that cycling the landing gear up and down again would have 
succeeded in getting all of the landing gear down and locked .  However , that action was not 
recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.  
5.9. The aural warnings that not all of the landing gear was locked down were genuine warnings .  
Pilots must respect warnings.  In this case, the pilots should have responded by performing a 
go-around, which would have given them more time to consider the situation.  
5.10.  The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position.  
If they had asked the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing gear, it is likely that 
they would have taken furth er action in an attempt to get the nose landing gear locked down.  
5.11.  The captain  should have  explained to the flight attendant the reason for the go -around, even 
though he believed that the situation had been resolved .  The flight attendant would have 
been be tter prepared should the landing have been less favourable.  
5.12.  The captain's predetermination of what was going to be required to get the landing gear down 
and locked interfered with the proper following of the Q RH checklist ; nevertheless, all of the 
items we re covered.

 Report 10 -010 6. Key lessons  
6.1. When critical systems begin intermittently to malfunction or behave abnormally, this is often  a 
precursor to total failure.  For this reason the diagnosis of these problems  should be 
exhaustive  and multifac eted. 
6.2. The more a pilot knows about aircraft systems, the better armed they will be to deal with 
emergency and abnormal situations.  
6.3. Aircraft warning systems are designed to alert pilot s to abnormal conditions.  Alerts should not 
be dismissed without considering all other availabl e information.  
6.4. Pilots must retain sufficient knowledge of aircraft systems to deal with situations not 
anticipated by Quick Reference Handbooks .

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission that would otherwise have resulted in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation; and  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety  issues that 
would not normally have resulted in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  that pre -empted issuing a recommendation  
7.2. On 21 April 2011 Bombardier published Flight Operatio ns Service Letter DH8 -SL-32-030A "to 
remind Flight Crew o f the appropriate procedures for operating the gear utilizing the normal or 
alternate extension systems ".  The service letter also addressed aspects of the second 
incident of a Q300 landing without the nose landing gear  extended on 9 February 2011, and 
suggested  "considerations for Flight Crew if confronted with an abnormal gear configuration, 
which cannot be rectified with the existing Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) procedures established 
within the scope of certification requirements ". 
As well as repeating procedures and considerations already included in the aircraft flight 
manual and QRH, the service letter included  the following:  
 flight crew should check the serviceability of indication lights when an expected 
configuration was not observed  
 cycling the gear as a step to achieve an all gear down -and-locked indication was 
not approved or recommended  
 the alternate gear indication lights should be checked with the taxi light OFF.  
 However, although Bombardier did not approve or recommend  cycling the landing gear , this 
service letter introduced the option, at the captain's sole discretion, of resetting the alternate 
extension system (if it had been used without success) and cycling the landing gear in a 
further attempt to get al l of the landing gear down and locked.  
7.3. In July 2011 Air Nelson amended its Q300 QRH to incorporate the above procedural changes 
and advice from Bombardier.  
7.4. On 28 October 2011 Bombardier issued Service Bulletin SB -8-32-173, Landing Gear - Special 
Inspection and Rectif ication - Alternate Downlock Indication System applicable to most Dash 
8 models including that operated by Air Nelson.  The Bulletin stated the following:  
Reason  
Problem: Potential for the landing gear alternate downlock indication  system to 
provide a false 'down and locked' indication.  
Cause:  In conjunction with a reported case of NLG [nose landing gear] collapse 
on landing, a review of the alternate downlock indicating system was carried 
out.  The review has revealed that the system can provide a false 'down and 
locked' indication due to a wiring fault.  This was not the cause of the reported 
NLG collapse.  
Solution: T his Special Inspection and Rectification  Bulletin provides a 
functional check procedure for the NLG and MLG [main la nding gear] alternate 
indication phototransistors . 

<< Page 34 >>
 Report 10 -010 All operators of the Dash 8 were advised by email of the bulletin, but the procedure was 
inadvertently  described as being applicable to the 100 series only.  When made aware of its 
applicability to its fleet, Air Nelson undertook the required inspections.   
7.5. On 15 March 2012 Air Nelso n issued an operational notice that required pilots to obtain a 
third -party report on the landing gear position in  any future instance of a conflict between the 
landing gear position advisory lights and the verification lights .  In the case of the main landing 
gear, that could be provided by the flight attendant.  For the nose landing gear , a fly-by of a  
ground observer, for example a n air traffic controller, w as recommended.  
7.6. On 7 May 2012 Bombardier advised that its Engineering group had identified the need to 
change the "alternate downlock indication system " and was working on a solution.  A 
prototype of a new version had been successfully tested on the bench.  
 Safety a ctions  addressing other issues  
7.7. Air Nelson fitted better filters to its hydraulic ground rig and amended the rig operating 
procedures to further reduce the likelihood of hydraulic fluid contamination . 
7.8. Air Nelson added cleaning of the nose landing gear lenses of t he down -lock verification system 
as an A -check task.  The cleaning of the lenses on the main landing gear legs w as already an 
A-check task.

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue or give notice of recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Civil  Aviation Authority , with 
notice of these recommendations given to Transport Canada . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in t he 
future.  
Recommendations  
8.3. On 28 June 2012 the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge 
Transport Canada to : 
 note the instances of false  verification of landing gear position reported for the Q300 
and some related aeroplanes and the potential for a false  indication to cause an 
accident  
 require Bombardier Aerospace to take action to improve the reliability and 
dependability of the down -lock verification system . (027/12)  
8.4. On 23 August 2012 the Director of Civil Aviation replied that he:  
will accept the recommendation by co -ordinating with Transport Canada on the 
safety issues as outlined.  
8.5. On 28 August 2012 the Director General, Civil Aviation,  of Transport Canada responded, in 
part:  
Transport Canada Civil Aviation National Aircraft Certification, Continuing 
Airworthiness Corrective Action engineers are working with Bombardier with 
respect to this accident and the highlighted discrepancies.  It has been 
identified that aircrew are not performing alternate gear extension and are 
relying solely on the secondary indication system. Consequently, Bombardier 
has re -evaluated their risk assessment and has implemented a Service Bulletin 
which requires an  inspection to verify the operation and integrity of the 
alternate downlock indication system and AFM [Aircraft Flight Manual] and 
QRH revisions which require the use of the alternate landing gear extension 
procedure for any malfunction not covered by a sp ecific procedure.  
The AFM Temporary  Amendment has been issued and is found in Section 4 for 
each individual aircraft model type AFM …  The accompanying QRH change is 
pending and is expected to appear in Revision 21 of the QRH.   
8.6. On 28 June 2012 the Commissi on recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
monitor the progress of the investigations by Air Nelson and Bombardier Aerospace into the 
causes of excessive wear  in Q300 nose landing gear  door actuators (part number 82910016 -
009) and liaise with  Transport Canada in order to produce acceptable corrective actions . 
(028/12)  
8.7. On 23 August 2012 the Director of Civil Aviation replied that he:  
considers that provisions for monitoring are already in place under Rule 12, 
and this aspect will address future  occurrences. The CAA will continue to work 
with Air Nelson in terms of monitoring the specific issue.
