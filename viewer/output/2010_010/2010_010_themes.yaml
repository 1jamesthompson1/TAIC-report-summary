- name: Hydraulic System Contamination
  explanation: Hydraulic system contamination is a safety theme relevant to this accident because debris in the hydraulic fluid was identified as the primary cause of the nose landing gear's failure to fully extend. The report states that "The failure of the nose landing gear to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator" (5.1). Additionally, the debris was likely from "damaged seals within the actuator" (5.1), and the presence of metallic particles and organic compounds in the fluid was confirmed by analyses (4.6). This contamination compromised the reliability of the landing gear system, directly impacting the safety of the aircraft during landing operations.
- name: Faulty Down-Lock Verification System
  explanation: The faulty down-lock verification system is a significant safety theme because it provided the pilots with a false indication that the nose landing gear was fully extended and locked when it was not. The report highlights that "With the nose landing gear stuck in a partially extended position, light from the taxi light was likely detected by the sensor for the down-lock verification system, causing it to give a false green light" (5.4). This false indication led the pilots to believe that the landing gear was secure, as evidenced by the captain's confidence in the verification system and the saying "a green is a green" (4.19). The unreliability of the verification system is underscored by the report's finding that "The verification system for checking if the landing gear is down and locked on the Dash 8 series of aircraft is not reliable enough for pilots to place total trust in it" (5.6).
- name: Inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM)
  explanation: Inadequate CRM is a safety theme in this accident, as the crew did not fully utilize all available resources to verify the status of the nose landing gear. The report indicates that "The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position" (5.10). This includes not asking the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing gear, which could have led to further action to secure it (5.10). Additionally, the report discusses the pilots' failure to communicate effectively and use problem-solving techniques, such as not informing the flight attendant of the abnormal gear indication and not performing a go-around in response to the aural warnings (4.43, 5.9).
- name: Inadequate Maintenance Procedures
  explanation: Inadequate maintenance procedures are a safety theme because the report suggests that the maintenance response to reported defects was not effective in identifying the true cause of the defects, which contributed to the incident. The report states that "maintenance action might initially fail to identify the true cause of a defect" (4.16) and that the intermittent nature of previous defects might now be recognized as symptomatic of fluid contamination or an actuator defect (4.13). Furthermore, the report notes that the "on-condition maintenance process should prevent the failure or degradation of a component from causing an operational incident" (4.15), implying that the existing maintenance processes were insufficient in preventing the incident.
- name: Design Flaws in Aircraft Systems
  explanation: Design flaws in aircraft systems are a safety theme because the report identifies issues with the design of the landing gear verification system that contributed to the incident. The report discusses the design of the verification system that falsely indicated the nose landing gear was down and locked (4.3) and the manufacturer's lack of recognition of the possibility of stray light activating the sensor (4.21). The Commission recommended that the manufacturer improve the reliability and dependability of the landing gear down-lock verification system (4.24), highlighting the need to address design flaws that can lead to safety risks.
- name: Response to Aural and Visual Warnings
  explanation: The response to aural and visual warnings is a safety theme because the pilots' reaction to the warnings was influenced by the false verification light, leading them to disregard genuine warnings. The report notes that the pilots disregarded the landing gear warning horn and the ground proximity warning system alert due to their belief that the verification system was correct (4.33). The pilots' decision not to perform a go-around after receiving the aural warnings is highlighted as a missed opportunity to reassess the situation (5.9). This theme emphasizes the importance of appropriately responding to warnings and the potential consequences of misinterpreting or ignoring them.
