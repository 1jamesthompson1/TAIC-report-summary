2010_010,027/12,"""On date the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he urge Transport Canada to:
- note the instances of false verification of landing gear position reported for the Q300 and some related aeroplanes and the potential for a false indication to cause an accident, and
- require Bombardier Aerospace to take action to improve the reliability and dependability of the down-lock verification system""",,"Assuming that the reason for the nose landing gear not fully extending was debris in the hydraulic fluid, it is possible that cycling the landing gear up and down again would have succeeded in getting all of the landing gear down and locked. However, that action was not recommended by the aeroplane manufacturer at the time.
