- name: Operating Conditions and Environmental Factors
  explanation: Operating conditions and environmental factors are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the jet boat was operating under "unfavourable conditions" (3.3) and specifically in "flat light conditions" which degraded the driver's ability to identify obstacles in the water (3.9, 3.10). The river level was also lower than usual, increasing the risk of submerged rocks and other obstacles being exposed (3.11). These conditions made it more challenging to navigate safely, highlighting the importance of adapting speed and operational decisions to the environment.
- name: Alcohol Impairment
  explanation: Alcohol impairment is a significant safety theme in this accident. The driver's "blood alcohol concentration was about three times the legal blood alcohol limit for driving a car on the road" (3.18), and the Commission found that alcohol consumption "almost certainly impaired the driver's ability to make good decisions and to operate the jet boat safely" (4.4). Despite the driver's confidence in their ability to navigate, the alcohol in their bloodstream "had almost certainly impaired their ability to make good decisions" (3.20), which is a critical factor in the accident's occurrence.
- name: Speed and Navigation
  explanation: Speed and navigation are crucial safety themes as the jet boat was traveling at a speed of "about 35-50 kilometres per hour" (3.13), which was not adjusted to match the deteriorating light conditions (3.14). The Commission suggests that a reduced speed would have likely provided "more time to identify any hazards ahead of the boat" (3.15) and could have lessened the impact's consequences (3.16). The driver's failure to adjust speed according to the conditions contributed to the accident's severity.
- name: Experience and Familiarity with the Route
  explanation: The driver's experience and familiarity with the route are safety themes because, although the driver was experienced, they did not possess the same level of knowledge as a commercial jet boat driver and were not anticipating the gravel bar in the river (3.12). This lack of specific knowledge about the safer route through the river contributed to the accident, as the driver attempted to navigate a shallower and more hazardous channel.
- name: Use of Safety Equipment
  explanation: The use of safety equipment is a relevant safety theme because, despite the accident, the driver had essential lifesaving and communication equipment on board, including a personal locator beacon (3.2). The activation of the beacon and the subsequent search and rescue operation demonstrate the importance of carrying such equipment. However, the presence of safety equipment did not prevent the accident, indicating that while essential, equipment alone is not sufficient to ensure safety without proper operational decisions.
- name: Data and Regulatory Oversight
  explanation: Data and regulatory oversight are safety themes because there is "limited data to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug use in the new zealand recreational maritime sector and its impacts on recreational boating accidents" (3.16). The lack of specific powers to test recreational boat drivers for alcohol or drugs after accidents (3.21) and the absence of enforceable drug and alcohol limits in the recreational sector (3.25) are regulatory gaps that hinder the understanding and management of such safety risks. The Commission has made recommendations to address these issues, emphasizing the need for improved data and regulations (3.26, 3.27).
