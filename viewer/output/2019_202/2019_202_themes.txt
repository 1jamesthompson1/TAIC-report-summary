Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Unfavorable operating conditions: The report highlights the importance of planning a jet boating trip and proceeding at a safe speed, particularly when navigating in unfavorable operating conditions. The driver's inability to adapt to changing light conditions and recognize obstructions in the river contributed to the accident.

2. Alcohol consumption: The driver and passengers had been consuming alcohol throughout the afternoon, and the driver's blood alcohol concentration was about three times the legal limit. Alcohol impaired the driver's ability to navigate safely and make good decisions, increasing the risk of the accident.

3. Lack of regulatory oversight: There is limited data available to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug use in the recreational maritime sector and its impact on boating accidents. The report highlights the need for appropriate legislation or rules to prohibit impaired individuals from operating recreational vessels, but such measures have not been implemented. This lack of regulatory oversight contributes to the ongoing risk of accidents caused by impaired operators.
