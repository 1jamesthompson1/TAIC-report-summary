  \ The private g roup was on an annual recreational jet-boating trip to the Hollyford\
  \ River . \nDuring the trip, a member of the group suffered a fatal injury when\
  \ the jet boat  on which \nthey were travelling made contact with a rock and c ollided\
  \ with  a gravel bar. The jet boat \nwas in good working order and the accident\
  \ was not a result of any  mechanical \nmalfunction.  \n3.2. The driver of the jet\
  \ boat  was an experienced recreational jet boat  operator  who carried \nessential\
  \ lifesaving and communication equipment on board , including a personal \nlocator\
  \ beacon .  Once the personal locator beacon  had been activated and  the signal\
  \ \nreceived , a search and rescue operation was initiated by the Rescue Coordination\
  \ Centre \nNew Zealand .  The survivors  were located and  airlifted to hospital\
  \ , two were suffering \nfrom serious injuries and showing signs of hypothermia.\
  \    \n3.3. There were a  number of unfavourable conditions that existed at the\
  \ time of the accident , \nwhich are discussed in the  analysis together with  the\
  \ importance of planning a jet \nboating  trip, even if it is only a  simple or\
  \ short  journey , and the need to proceed at a safe \nspeed , particularly when\
  \ navigating in unfavourable  operating conditions .    \n3.4. The Commission found\
  \  that al cohol was a factor contributing to the accident. The \nanalysis also\
  \ discusses the issue of  there being  limited data to show  the exten t of \nalcohol\
  \ - and drug -related accidents  in the recreational maritime boating sector in\
  \ New \nZealand.  \nOperating  conditions  \n3.5. Driving a jet boat  under normal\
  \  operating  conditions require s attention, skill and \nplanning . When environmental\
  \ conditions  are unfavourable , as was the case in this  \naccident,  it is even\
  \ more important to plan the trip thoroughly  and drive to the \ncondition s. This\
  \ may i nclude  the driver  recognising the limits of their own ability, \nreducing\
  \ speed to match the operating environment  and re-evaluating whether to \ncontinue\
  \ the journey  should operating conditions deteriorate . The unfavourable  \noperating\
  \ environment in which the jet boat  was operating at the time of the accident is\
  \ \ndiscussed in detail below . \nVisibility  \n3.6. The Hollyford River  is a class\
  \ 3 river , with some  sections containing  rocks , logs and \nshallows.  Class\
  \ 3 rivers are considered difficult to navigate even under favourable  \nconditions\
  \ . Skills are required and they are not recommended for families . \n3.7. Figure\
  \ 8 is a photo graph  of the gravel bar area  taken three days  after the accident\
  \ , and is \nrepresentative of the light condition s at the approximate time of\
  \ t he accident.  \n \nFinal report MO -2019 -202 \n<< Page 9 >>\n  \nFigure 8:\
  \ Photo graph  of the gravel bar area , taken at 2010 on 21 March 2019  \n3.8. When\
  \ the jet boat  departed from Lake McKerrow  Hut sometime after 1930 , visibility\
  \ was \nstarting to  deteriorat e due to the reduction in the amount of daylight.\
  \  The exact time of \nthe accident is unknown , but it is estimated to have occurred\
  \ at about 2010  based on \ninterviews and references to actual lighting conditions\
  \ at the time.  As the boat \nprogressed upriver it is very  likely that the driver's\
  \ eyes would have been constantly \nadjusting to the changing light levels. Figure\
  \ 9 is a sequence of photo graph s of the \ngravel bar area  showing how quickly\
  \ the lighting conditions can change. The \nphoto graph s were  taken between 1942\
  \ a nd 2025  on 21 March 2019, three days after the \naccident . \n3.9. A commercial\
  \ jet boat driver with more than 1,000 hours of experience on the Hollyford \nRiver\
  \ advised that the jet boat would have been travelling under flat light conditions\
  \ if \nthe lighting conditions at the time of the accident were similar to those\
  \ in Figure 8. Flat \nlight is a term used to describe the lighting condition when\
  \ the sun has gone behind the \nmountains and the light is fading.  Under flat light\
  \ conditions, depth perception is \ndegraded and it is harder than in daylight to\
  \ distinguish features in the water; the \nshadows cast by the forest on the banks\
  \ of the river could have distorted its true width, \nmaking it appear narrower\
  \ and harder to read.  \n3.10. It is likely that when the driver was approaching\
  \ the left-hand  turn in the river the natural \nlight conditions had degraded .\
  \  With the driver trying to adapt his eyesight to the \nchanging light conditions\
  \ and it becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish features, \nthe driver's\
  \ ability to id entify any obstructions in the river would have been  significantly\
  \ \nreduced.   As a result,  the driver would have been  unable to take any avoidance\
  \ action \nbefore impact.  \n\n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report MO -2019 -202 \
  \ \nFigure 9: Photo graph s of the gravel bar area taken at 1942 , 2010 , 2015 \
  \ and 2025  hrs \nRiver level  \n3.11. The river level was lower than usual and\
  \ continued to drop overnight. T his increased the \nrisk of submerged rocks and\
  \ other obstacles  being  expos ed.  Under flat light conditions, \nit would have\
  \ been harder for the driver to see obstacles from a safe distance.  \nExperience\
  \  \n3.12. The driver, although an experienced recreational jet boat driver, did\
  \ not have the same \nlevel of knowledge and skill as that o f a commercial jet\
  \ boat  driver a nd was not \nanticipating the gravel bar in the ri ver.  It is\
  \ very likely that the driver  was not aware that \nthe safer route , used by commercial\
  \ jet boat drivers , was through the narrower but \ndeeper channel south of the\
  \ gravel bar , not the shallower northern channel the driver \nattempt ed to navigate.\
  \  \nSpeed  \n3.13. The jet boat  was travelling at about 35-50 kilometres per hour\
  \  at the time of the \naccident, the same speed it was travelling on the downstream\
  \  trip when the lighting \ncondition was good .  \n3.14. However, on the return\
  \ trip to Lake Alabaster Hut the operating environment, specifically  \nthe light\
  \ condition s, deteriorated and reduced the driver's ability to navigate  the jet\
  \ boat  \nsafely .  \n3.15. Had the driver chosen to reduce speed on the return\
  \ trip to match the operating \nenvironment , it is likely that the re would have\
  \  been  more time to identify any hazards \nahead of the boat and, if necessary\
  \ , take avoiding action.  \n3.16. Importantly , had the boat been proceeding at\
  \ a safe speed appropriate to the conditions \nand still made contact with the same\
  \ rock , it is likely that the consequences of the impact \nwould have been considerably\
  \ reduced.   \n \n\n \nFinal report MO -2019 -202 \n<< Page 11 >>\n Alcohol consumption\
  \  \nSafety issue: There is limited data to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug\
  \ use in the \nNew Zealand recreational maritime sector and its impacts  on recreational\
  \ boating \naccidents.  \n3.17. The driver and passengers on the jet boat  had been\
  \ consuming alcohol through out the \nafternoon . The driver's blood alcohol concentration\
  \ was tested7 and found to be within \nthe approximate range of 135 -195 milligrams\
  \ per 1 00 millilitres  at the time of the \naccident . The legal blood alcohol\
  \ limit in New Zealand  for a car driver on the road, 20 \nyears old or over, is\
  \ 50 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood. No -one on the jet boat , \nincluding\
  \ the driver , felt they were intoxi cated or incapacitated . The driver reported\
  \ \nbeing confident of being able to navigate the jet boat  safely at all times\
  \ .  \n3.18. The Commission found that it was virtually certain that  the driver\
  \ of the jet boat was \nimpaired and their ability to navigate safely compromised.\
  \  The driver's blood alcohol \nconcentration was about three  times the legal blood\
  \ alcohol limit for driving  a car on the \nroad.   \n3.19. The detrimental effects\
  \ of alcohol on cognitive ability are well documented.  Alcohol can \nimpair co\
  \ -ordination and judg ement and is a major cause of road injury in New Zealand.\
  \  \nMaritime New Zealand's website states  that alcohol will:  \nDecrease your\
  \ coordination and ability to perform a simple task, such as \nputting on a lifejacket\
  \  \nIncrease your sense of disorientation  \nMake it harder for you to stay afloat\
  \ in the water  \nLower concentration of blood going to your brain and muscles,\
  \ contributing \nto muscle heat and fluid loss  \nReduce your ability to hold your\
  \ breath  \nSuppress your airway protection flexes and make it easier  for you to\
  \ inhale \nwater  \nGive you a false sense of your situation , causing you to attempt\
  \ tasks beyond \nyour abilities  \nReduce your awareness of the onset of hypothermia\
  \  \n3.20. The driver  was unaware of the extent of their intoxica tion, and perceived\
  \ the risk of \nproceeding through the Hollyford River under flat light conditions\
  \  to be low . However , \nthe amount of alcohol in the driver's bloodstream had\
  \ almost certainly  impaired their \nability to make good decisions and to operate\
  \ the jet boat  safely under what were \nalready difficult operating conditions.\
  \  \nRegulatory oversight  \n3.21. Maritime New Zealand records show that since\
  \ January 2015 , 79 people have died in \nrecreational boating accidents in New\
  \ Zealand. Between January 2019 and October 2019, \n19 people died in recreatio\
  \ nal boating accidents. It is unclear how many of these fatal \naccidents were\
  \  a consequence of the skipper s being impaired , because there are no \n     \
  \                                                   \n7 At the Institute of Environmental\
  \ Science and Research Limited . The blood specimens were collected \non 19 March\
  \ 2019 at about 0249.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report MO -2019 -202 specific\
  \ powers to test recreational boat drivers and skippers for the presence of alcohol\
  \ \nor drugs if they are involved in accident s.  \n3.22. The detrimental effects\
  \ of alcohol and drugs on cognitive ability have been described \nand documented\
  \ by researchers in the transport sector. For example, the 2018 \nrecreational boating\
  \ statistics released by the United States Coast G uard found that \nalcohol was\
  \ the leading known contributing factor in fatal boating accidents in the \nUnited\
  \ States , accounting for 100 deaths or 19 percent of total fatalities in the United\
  \ \nStates recreational boating sector.   \n3.23. The Commission has previously\
  \  recommended appropriate legislation or rules to \nprohibit people in safety -critical\
  \ roles being impaired by alcohol or drugs. The \nrecommendation included people\
  \ operating recreational vessel s. The Commission \nconsiders this to be a long-standing\
  \ and serious  transport safety concern and it remains \non the Commission's watchlist8.\
  \ The Ministry of Transport undertook policy work in \nresponse to the recommendation,\
  \ including commissioning a report by the New Zealand \nInstitute of Economic Research\
  \  on a cross -modal risk analysis of substance impairment.   \nThe report noted:\
  \  \nMaritime NZ (2008) noted that alcohol was consumed in 18% of boating \nfatalities\
  \ based on post -mortem testing investigations. This percentage is \nconsidered\
  \ to be a conservative estimate due to the li mited opportunity for \ntesting and\
  \ gathering information on factors contributing to maritime \nfatalities. For the\
  \ purpose of our analysis we have assumed that substance \nimpairment is a contributing\
  \ factor in 25% of recreational maritime fatalities.  \n3.24. The New Z ealand Institute\
  \ of Economic Research  estimated there were about 43 \nrecreational boating fatalities\
  \ in the period 2002 -2011 where substance impairment \nmight have been a factor.\
  \  \n3.25. New Zealand  Police and Maritime New Zealand have expressed support for\
  \ enforcea ble \ndrug and alcohol limits in the recreational sector, and the New\
  \ Zealand Safer Boating \nForum's 2014 strategy recommended mandatory alcohol limits\
  \ for recreational skippers. \nHowever, the Ministry of Transport considers that\
  \ the current data on alcohol - and drug - \nrelated incidents do es not justify\
  \ the higher levels of intervention proposed by the \nCommission's recommendation.\
  \ The Ministry has indicated  that the decision could be \nreconsidered if new data\
  \ gathered by the regulators indicate d a widespread problem.  \n3.26. The Commission's\
  \ recommendation remains open and the fatal consequences in this \naccident highlight\
  \ the ongoing risk of not implementing safety action s to address this  \nrecommendation\
  \ . Furthermore, the Commission believes that the estimated 43 deaths in \nthe 2002\
  \ -2011 period show that the risk is not as low as reasonably practicable and more\
  \ \nneeds to be done to address the Commission's recommendation.  \n3.27. We acknowledge\
  \ the work  that Maritime New Zealand  has done in developing its fatal \naccident\
  \ database and encourage further work on the database. A recommendation has \nbeen\
  \ made to Maritime New Zealand to address the need to improve the quality of the\
  \ \ndata so that the industry is better able to understand the role of alcohol and\
  \ drugs in \nrecreational boating accidents.  \n  \n                           \
