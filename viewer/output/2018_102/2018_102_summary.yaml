    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 40
  explanation: Human error and assumptions played a significant role in the incident. The team leader inadvertently set the points in the wrong direction, which was a lapse in human factors terms (3.18). Additionally, the train driver had confirmation bias, which resulted in the decision not to stop at the Red light (3.24). These errors and assumptions directly contributed to the wrong-routing of the train and the subsequent SPAD.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While there is no direct mention of inadequate training leading to the incident, the document does highlight the importance of non-technical skills and the need for better communication and practice of these skills (3.31). This suggests that training and competency, particularly in non-technical skills, could be an underlying factor.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document indicates that staff who are appropriately trained within work groups liaise directly with train control to obtain permission to stable equipment on a crossing loop (3.13). However, the error made by the team leader in setting the points suggests a possible lack of familiarity with the equipment or procedures, contributing to the incident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Crew Resource Management issues are evident in the lack of cross-checking and verification of important tasks (3.18). The incident could have been prevented with better teamwork and communication, which are key components of CRM.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The incident was caused by a failure to adhere to safety procedures. The work group did not follow the correct procedures for protecting the rail vehicles stabled in the loop (3.27), and the train controller did not challenge the work group into following the proper procedure (3.28).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not explicitly discuss organizational safety culture, but the procedural failures and lack of challenge by the train controller suggest that safety culture may have played a role in the incident (3.27, 3.28).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Risk management and analysis could have prevented the incident if potential hazards had been identified and mitigated. The failure to verify that the required protection had been put in place indicates a lapse in risk management (4.1).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not provide specific information on regulatory oversight and compliance issues. However, the failure to follow established rules and procedures implies that compliance may have been a factor (3.27, 3.28).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The train driver's situational awareness was compromised by the confirmation bias, leading to the SPAD (3.24). This indicates that situational awareness was a contributing factor to the incident.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of emergency response preparedness or its impact on the incident in the provided document. Therefore, it is not applicable as a safety theme in this context.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The incident was not related to the maintenance or inspection of equipment, as the points were manually set incorrectly by a staff member (3.18). Therefore, this theme does not apply to the incident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The use of automation is not mentioned as a contributing factor to the incident. The crossing loop was semi-automatic, and the points were supposed to be manually set and isolated (3.6). Therefore, automation is not a relevant safety theme in this case.
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions are not mentioned as a factor in the incident. The report does not indicate that weather played any role in the decision-making process or the outcome of the event.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Although communication between the train controller and the workgroup team leader was mentioned, it was not characterized as a breakdown. The issue was more related to the incorrect information being communicated and the lack of verification (3.17, 3.20).
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the incident outside of those already defined.
