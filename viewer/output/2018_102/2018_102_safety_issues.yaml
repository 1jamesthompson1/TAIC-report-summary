- safety_issue: 'The crossing loops'' semi-automatic system lacks visibility for train control regarding how the points are set or what the signals are displaying, requiring manual input from train drivers to activate the points to enter a crossing loop.

- safety_issue: 'The procedure for manually setting and isolating points at crossing loops to prevent automatic resetting and ensure trains pass straight on the main line was not correctly followed, leading to the freight train being wrongly routed into the loop.

- safety_issue: 'The lack of a requirement for a second person to verify the correct setting and isolation of points at crossing loops introduces a risk of single-person errors leading to incidents.

- safety_issue: 'Miscommunication between the workgroup team leader and train control regarding the status of points, and the failure to confirm and correctly document the points'' status, contributed to the incident.

- safety_issue: 'The train driver''s reliance on incorrect information received from train control and the workgroup team leader, without verifying the points'' setting at the crossing loop, led to a signal passed at danger (SPAD) incident.

- safety_issue: 'The absence of trackside distance markers to support the stabilised approach braking technique potentially compromises the ability of train drivers to control train speed and stop before signals at crossing loops.
