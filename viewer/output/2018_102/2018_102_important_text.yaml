  \ The wrong -routing of the freight train into the crossing loop was a serious event.\
  \  A \ncollision between a loaded freight train and heavy track maintenance rail\
  \ vehicles has the \npotential to cause significant  damage , and injury to persons.\
  \  In examining the various \nKiwiRail rules and stand ard operating procedures,\
  \ it appears that if they had all been \nfollowed  correctly , the route for the\
  \ train would not have been set for the loop, and even \nif it had been, the train\
  \ driver would have stopped the train before it entered the loop . \n3.2. The following\
  \ analysis discusses the circumstances that led to the incident , and several \n\
  factors that either directly or indirectly contributed to the incident . \n \nWhat\
  \ happened  \nCrossing loops  \n3.3. Crossing loops allow trains travelling in opposite\
  \ directions on a single -track section of \nline to cross safely.  Train control\
  \ issues track warrant s that specify which crossing loops \nwill be used to cross\
  \ opposing trains.  The track warrant s tates  which train will use the \nmain line\
  \ and which will enter the loop.  The crossing loops of the type at Taimate are\
  \ \nsemi-automatic .  Train control has no visibility of how the points are set\
  \ or what the \nsignals  are displaying .  Some manual input is required from train\
  \ drivers to activate the \npoints to enter a crossing loop.   \n3.4. When a train\
  \ is required to enter a crossing loop for an opposing train, the train driver \n\
  stops the train short of the signal and unlocks the manual input box (see Figure\
  \ 4).  The \ntrain will have activat ed the track circuit9 located 400 m back from\
  \  the cro ssing loop .  The \ntrain driver is able to press the 'loop' button to\
  \ set the points to access to the loop.  A n \n'L' illuminates on the signal when\
  \ the points are set.  Once the train has entered the loop, \nthe points and signals\
  \ automatically reset to allow t he opposing  train to pass on the \nadjacent main\
  \  line.  When the opposing  train has passed clear of the crossing loop track \n\
  circuits , the points and signals automatically reset to allow the train sitting\
  \ in the loop to \ndepart  through the opposite end of the loop. \n3.5. The points\
  \ then automatically reset to their standard position , for trains to pass straight\
  \ \nthrough on the main  line.  All signals then return to Red until the next  train\
  \ triggers one \nof the track circuits within 400  m of the crossing loop.  See\
  \ Appendix 1 for diagrams.  \n                                                 \
  \       \n9 An insulated joint separating two adjacent lengths of rail track that\
  \ enables sensors to detect when a \ntrain moves from one section of rail across\
  \ the insulated joint to the next section of rail.  At a crossing \nloop within\
  \ a Track Warrant controlled are a, only those tracks within 400m of loop are fitted\
  \ with \nsensors.  \n  \nFinal Report RO -2018 -102 \n<< Page 7 >>\n  \nFigure 4:\
  \ Crossing loop layout  \n3.6. With track maintenance machines stabled in the crossing\
  \ loop , the points at both ends \nwere supposed to have been  manually set for\
  \ trains to pass straight through on the main  \nline, and isolated (left in manual\
  \ operation mode).  This  would have  prevent ed the \ncrossing loop automatically\
  \ setting the points to allow the maintenance equipment out \nof the loop after\
  \ a train had passed by.   \n3.7. Points isolation is accomplished by removin g\
  \ a crank handle from the locked crank \nhandle box (see Figure 4)  by the points\
  \ and hand winding10 them into the correct \nposition, before placing the crank\
  \ handle loosely in the bottom of the crank handle box.  \nThis means the crossing\
  \ loop is no longer autom atic, and train drivers approaching the \ncrossing loop\
  \ encounter a Red signal that does not automatically change to yellow as the \n\
  trains approach.   The team leader of the workgroup had overall responsib ility\
  \ for \nensuring that the points were  correctly set and isolated11. \n3.8. Stabling\
  \ track machines on a crossing loop is an acceptable practice within the rail \n\
  operating rules . However , in doing so operating flexibility may be compromised\
  \ by \nleaving one less cro ssing point  available , which  could  have an effect\
  \ on s chedules and \nproduction.  When possible , it is preferable to stable track\
  \ machines in a siding or other \nsuch area and leave crossing loops clear.   Utilising\
  \ sidings also means the equipment is \nfurther removed from the mainline and therefore\
  \ reduc es risk. \n                                                        \n10\
  \ Sometimes referred to as 'hand winding points'; refers to manually operating a\
  \ set of points by \nutilising a hand crank or lever to set the route.  \n11 Rule\

  \ -102 The worksite - communications and responsibilities  \n3.9. Train control\
  \ has overall responsibility for the safe movement of rail vehicles and track \n\
  access on the controlled network.  This includes directing and recording the movements\
  \ \nof all trains on a train control diagram (see Appendix 2), as well as authorising\
  \ \nmaintenance work groups to work on track.   \n3.10. Within track w arrant territory,\
  \ train control authorises an RPO of a multiple worksite  \nprotected work area\
  \  to occupy the appropriate section of track by iss uing a track \nwarrant12. \
  \ If a train is required to pass through the track warrant controlled area, the\
  \ \ntrain driver liaise s with the RPO to ensure  that the track is safe and clear\
  \ before the \nmovement is authorised  to enter the protected area . \n3.11. When\
  \ the RPO c alls train control and cancels  the track warrant , this only confirms\
  \ that \nthe mainline is clear and available for normal traffic to resume.  A track\
  \ warrant does not \ncover sidings, yards or other non -main -line areas such as\
  \ crossing loops.  \n3.12. KiwiRail Rule 90213 explains the  flow of information\
  \ through a multiple worksite \nprotected work area (see Figure 5).  Each individual\
  \ worksite has a site protector who co -\nordinates with the RPO,  who in t urn\
  \ communicates directly with train c ontrol to control \nthe movement  of rail vehicles\
  \ through the protected work area . \n \n \nFigure 5: Hierarchy of control and communications\

  \ RPOs and site protector s are not required to be trained or authorised to operate\
  \ signals \nor points , but work group team leader s and the drivers of maintenance\
  \ rail vehicles  are.  \nStaff who are  appropriately trained within work groups\
  \ liaise directly with train control to \nobtain permission to , in this case, \
  \ stable equipment on a crossing loop.  It is then their \nresponsibility to ensur\
  \ e that  the points at both ends of the loop are properly set and \nisolated, and\
  \ pass this information to train control (see Figure 5 - dotted blue line).  \n\
  The day before the incident  \n3.14. The above procedure was not carried out the\
  \ day before  the incident.  The equipment \nwas stabled on the Taimate crossing\
  \ loop without the points being manually set and \nisolated.  When the team leader\
  \ called train control to let them know  that the \nmaintenance vehicles were occu\
  \ pying the loop for the night, the train controller on duty \nat the time did not\
  \ confirm  the status of the points with them  and did not mark the \nstatus of\
  \ the points on the train control diagram.  Consequently, the crossing loop was\
  \ \nleft in semi -automatic mo de for the entire night , with maintenance vehicles\
  \ essentially \nunprotected .  Fortunately,  no trains were scheduled through the\
  \ area that night.  \n3.15. The train controller  did not confirm the status of\
  \ the points with the workgroup team \nleader based on an  interpret ation  that\
  \ the points had not failed and were not subject to \nan outage  (see Figure 6)\
  \ .  That controller' s interpretation was not shared by other senior \ncontrollers\
  \ who were asked which was the correct procedure to apply .  Correct practice \n\
  would se e the  train controller  confirm  with the workgroup  the points were correctly\
  \ set \nand isolated, and then mark the train control diagram accordingly.  \n \n\
  Figure 6: Train control diagram conventions  \n3.16. Even if there was some doubt,\
  \ it would  have been good non -technical -skills practice  to \nconfirm anyway,\
  \ rather than relying on an assumption that the points were set for trains \nto\
  \ pass by on the main line.  \nThe day of the incident  \n3.17. On the day of the\
  \ incident, the work group at Taimate called the train controller on \nduty14 to\
  \ say the track machines were stabled on the crossing loop.  The train controller\
  \ \nreminded the work group  that they needed to manually set and isolate the points\
  \ to \nprotect the track machines15 (as per Rule 914).  Once this protection was\
  \ confirmed, the \n                                                        \n14\

  \ >>\n Final Report RO -2018 -102 train controller  noted on the train control diagram\
  \ that the track machines were on the \nloop and that the points had been set and\
  \ isolated in the normal (main  line only) \nposition.  \n3.18. The correct proc\
  \ edure was applied on this day.  The is sue was that the team leader had  \ninadvertently\
  \ set the points in the wrong direction, so the information passed to the train\
  \ \ncontroller was incorrect.  This failure in human factors terms is called a lapse\
  \ , and was a \nfailure in the first procedure designed to protect the stabled vehicles\
  \ from collision .  The \nfact that nobody else was cross -checking such an important\
  \ task is a failure in itself.  \nHuman s make mistakes, and if the system requires\
  \ no alternative means of ve rification, \nthese one -person errors can result in\
  \ incidents (in this case) or accidents in other \ncircumstances.   The potential\
  \ for the same error to occur at the opposite end of the \ncrossing loop also existed\
  \ without a second person confirmation.  \nThe train  driver's perspective  \n3.19.\
  \ The train driver was travelling in a car when the train controller and the team\
  \ leader were \ndiscussing the status of the Taimate crossing loop  points  on the\
  \ radio .  The car had a \nKiwiRail portable radio  inside , so the train driver\
  \ ove rheard the conversation.  The \nconversation was of interest to  the train\
  \ driver because they would be taking the next \nnorthbound train  through Taimate\
  \  later that evening.  The train driver noted  that the \nworkgroup team leader\
  \ and train controller confirm ed that the route w as set for all trains \nto travel\
  \ straight through on the main line.  \n3.20. The train driver took over the freight\
  \ train and was later issued with a track warrant by \nthe same train controller\
  \ , authorising the train to proceed from  Pines to Seddon, through \nTaimate and\
  \ several other locations .  Despite having overheard the earlier conversation \n\
  between the team leader  at Taimate and the train controller, the train driver still\
  \ \nconfirmed with the train controller that the points at Taimate had been \"isolated\
  \ in the \ncorrect normal position \". \n3.21. The train driver had then twice received\
  \ confirmation that the route would be set straight \nthrough Taimate on the main\
  \ line.   The conversation  the train driver overheard  between \nthe workgroup\
  \ and train control contained incorrect information, which was later  \nrepeated\
  \ by train control directly to the train driver.  \n3.22. The signal at the crossing\
  \ loop was Red, and that was what t he train driver was expecting \nto see.  Effectively\
  \ , the track warrant authorise d the train to pass the Red signal without \nfurther\
  \ communication with train control , but only after the train driver had complied\
  \ \nwith Rule 422 of the Operating Rules and confirm ed that the route was correctly\
  \ set.   \n3.23. Rule 422 states that on encountering a Red Stop signal with no\
  \ 'A' light illuminated at a \ncrossing loop , the first action should be to stop\
  \ at the signal before confirming the \nreason for the signal being at Red  (see\
  \ Figure 7) .  In this case the train drive r had \nreceived several  reports confirm\
  \ ing that  the signal was Red due  to the points being \nmanually set for the correct\
  \ mainline route . \n  \n                                                      \
  \  \nincluding but not limited to 'Setting a diverging route'.  When MTMVs [track\
  \ machiner y] are required to \nberth on a crossing loop \u2026 Train Control permission\

  \  \nFigure 7: Rule 422, actions on Red signal at a crossing loop  \n3.24. Even\
  \ though the  train driver expected the route to be set correctly, t he train approached\
  \ \nthe Taimate crossing loop  signal cautiously  at about 20 km/h.  However, the\
  \  train driver \nhad stopped braking and was preparing to let the train coast through\
  \ the station when \nhe noticed in the locomotive headlights that the points ahead\
  \ were set for the loop.  The \ndriver had receiv ed information th at the points\
  \ were correctly set  on two previous \noccasions and as a result  likely  had confirmation\
  \ bias16, which resulted in  the decision to  \nnot stop at the Red light .  The\
  \ train c oasted through the Red signal and in doing so it \nresulted in  a SPAD\
  \  (signal passed at danger) .  \n3.25. The result was that the train was not able\
  \ to stop before entering the loop, in spite of the \nemergency brakes being applied.\
  \  In other words , the train was travelling too fast to st op \nin the visual distance\
  \ ahea d, a second  failure in defences designed to protect the vehicles \nstabled\
  \ on the loop.  \nSummary  \n3.26. There were a number of procedural failures, of\
  \ which some did not directly contribute to \nthe incident but are nevertheless\
  \ of concern.  \n3.27. The day before the incident, the correct procedures for protecting\
  \ the rail vehicles \nstabled in the loop had not been followed by the work group,\
  \ and the ir error had not \nbeen picked up or challenged by the train controller\
  \ on duty at the time.  \n3.28. It is about as likely as not that the same would\
  \ have  occurred on the day of the incident \nhad it not been for a different train\
  \ controller on duty challenging the work group into \nfollowing the proper procedure\
  \ .  In spite of the work group being reminded of the proper \nprocedure, an error\
  \ resulted in the south -end points being left in the wrong position \nanyway. \
  \ \n3.29. The train driver, having twice received confirmation that the points would\
  \ be correctly set \nfor the train, then assumed that to be the case and did not\
  \ slow the train sufficiently to \nstop, resulting  in a SPAD . \n3.30. KiwiRail\
  \ undertook a range of safety actions to address those procedural errors, negating\
  \ \nthe need for the Commission to make safety recommendations  (see section 6).\
  \ \n3.31. There were several examples in the incident sequence where better communication\
  \ and \nthe practice of good non -technical skills could have detected one or more\
  \ of the errors \nmade and prevented the incident.  The Commission has previously\
  \ commented on the \nstandard of non -technical skills in the rail industry in its\
  \ report RO 2011 -10117.  This  \nrecommendation is repeated in section 7 of this\
  \ report . \nStabilised approach technique  \n3.32. The stabilised braking approach\
  \ is a relatively new KiwiRail initiative where  train drivers  \nare taught to\
  \ reduce the speed of their train s to certain targets at specifie d distances \n\
  \                                                        \n16 The tendency to interpret\
