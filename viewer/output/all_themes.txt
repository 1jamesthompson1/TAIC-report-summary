Themes for 2011_201: 
The causes of the accident outlined in the accident investigation report are as follows:

1. The design of the SPTDL-150P lifeboat davit does not allow for thorough examination or effective lubrication of the wire falls where they pass around the fixed guides. Lack of proper lubrication can lead to rapid corrosion and possible premature failure of the wire rope.

2. The design of the SPTDL-150P davit allows the outer ends of the fixed arm to flex towards the adjacent moving trolley beam when the load is taken by the wire falls, causing the trolley beam structure to contact the wire guides and possibly the wire falls. This can result in excessive wear and premature failure of the wire rope.

Given these causes, the following recommendations have been made:

1. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should alert all owners of vessels fitted with the SPTDL-150P stored-power telescopic lifeboat davits about the accident and provide instructions for immediate inspections and maintenance to prevent wire rope failures.
  
2. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should conduct a technical assessment of other lifeboat davit models it has produced to identify similar safety issues and alert owners of those davits to take necessary inspections and maintenance actions.
  
3. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should review the design of the SPTDL-150P lifeboat davit system to address the issue of the fixed davit arm flexing inward under load and potentially causing premature failure of components.

1. Breakdown in bridge team performance: The deviation from the planned passage was attributed to a breakdown in bridge team performance, indicating a lack of coordination and communication among the bridge team members.
2. Lack of adherence to bridge resource management (BRM) practices: The report highlights that the bridge team did not strictly follow the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, which are part of BRM practices.
3. Insufficient training and familiarity with BRM: The bridge team members on board the Monte Stello had varying levels of formal BRM training, and the crew composition was ad hoc, leading to a lower standard of bridge resource management compared to other vessels operated under KiwiRail's safety management system.
Themes for 2011_203: 
Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Catastrophic engine failure: The report identifies that the failure of the engine connecting rod assembly is a common cause of catastrophic engine failure. In this case, the failure occurred when the connecting rod bolts failed in overload, leading to severe damage to the engine components.

2. Maintenance regime: The report highlights that the maintenance regime followed by Fullers did not correspond to the engine manufacturer's recommended maintenance program. There was a discrepancy between Fullers' extended replacement program and the manufacturer's recommended interval for bearing replacement. The report suggests that the timing or quality of maintenance may have contributed to the engine failure.

3. Lubrication and cooling: The report discusses the role of lubrication and cooling in engine failure. It mentions that a reduction in flow of cooling water or lubricating oil can result in overheating or localized overheating of the engine. The report also notes that the lubricating oil analysis program did not detect any significant deterioration in the engine condition, but the lubricating oil was within normal parameters.

4. Emergency response: The report evaluates the emergency response to the engine failure and identifies two safety issues. Firstly, only half of the fixed CO2 fire-suppression system was released into the engine room, which may not have been sufficient to extinguish a sustained fire. Secondly, the procedure for abandoning ship when another vessel is involved was not documented or practiced during evacuation drills.

5. Ship-to-ship passenger transfer: The report suggests that in the congested Hauraki Gulf, it is highly likely that abandoning ship would involve a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers and crew. The report recommends including this scenario in emergency response training and drills, as well as considering design changes to facilitate ship-to-ship passenger transfers.

6. Root cause determination: The report acknowledges that due to the severity of the damage to engine components, it was not possible to determine the exact root cause of the failure. However, it suggests that localised overheating caused by fluctuating lubricating oil and cooling water pressures could not be excluded as a contributing factor.

The causes of the accident on the Easy Rider can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the vessel was heavily loaded with cargo, which affected its stability and buoyancy. Secondly, the skipper of the vessel did not hold the necessary qualification to be in command, which may have led to poor decision-making and navigation. Lastly, the weather conditions at the time of the accident were not ideal, with overcast skies and rain, increasing the risk of capsizing. These factors combined to create a dangerous situation that ultimately led to the accident.
Themes for 2012_202: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Navigation and Charting: The skipper was aware of the risks associated with navigating close to rocks and reefs, but the accuracy of underwater charting surveys in the area was limited. The collision with the rock could have been avoided or minimized if the skipper had kept the vessel's speed to a minimum until clear of the rocky area.

2. Passenger Overload: The Torea was carrying 24 passengers when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers. The skipper assumed that the trip leader was aware of the maximum limit, and the crew did not physically count the number of passengers before departure. This safety issue could have resulted in not enough lifejackets for all passengers in the event of an emergency.

3. Safety Management System: Skippers of commercial vessels should be aware of the maximum permitted number of persons on board. The vessel's fit-for-purpose certificate takes into consideration factors such as the crew-to-passenger ratio. Not being aware of passenger overload can lead to delays in search and rescue response and potential serious injury or death. The operator has since changed procedures to address this safety issue.

4. Lack of knowledge about safe working loads: The report highlights that the port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual safe working loads of the mooring bollards on the wharf. This lack of knowledge made it impossible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe.

5. Inadequate response to high wind warning: The port's response to the high wind warning was rudimentary and did not automatically trigger the necessary support and resources for the vessel. The report suggests that a more robust port response and effective promulgation of weather information could have improved the safety of vessels berthed at the port.

6. Failure to implement previous recommendations: The report notes that there were similarities between this accident and a previous accident in 2015. Despite control measures being implemented as a result of the previous accident, further work was still required to improve safety. This highlights a failure to fully implement previous recommendations and lessons learned.
Themes for 2017_205: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate risk mitigation: The operator's safety management system did not fully mitigate the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, despite a previous incident with similar circumstances. The use of high-powered incandescent reflector lamps in ships' cargo holds is commonplace, but alternative lighting options that do not produce high temperatures, such as LED lamps, should be considered. Procedures should be in place to ensure that cargo hold lighting systems are turned off or isolated at an appropriate time to prevent fire hazards.

2. Lack of clear responsibilities: The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties. There should be a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies.

3. Inadequate training: The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires. There should be more information and training for FENZ crews on fighting fires on board ships in port or near coastal situations to achieve a more common approach when ship and shore-based crews are jointly involved in firefighting operations.

Themes for 2018_203: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate passage planning and execution: The report highlights that the bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk fell short of achieving good industry practice for both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management. This includes not following the agreed passage plan, relying too much on visual navigation, and not utilizing electronic navigation aids effectively.

2. Lack of situational awareness: The bridge team, including the pilot, failed to fully use the available electronic navigation aids, resulting in a loss of situational awareness. They did not recognize that the ship was deviating from the planned track, leading to the grounding. This lack of situational awareness was exacerbated by navigating primarily by eye and not verifying their observations with the ship's electronic navigation systems.

3. Complacency and inadequate teamwork: The report suggests that complacency played a role in the grounding, as the bridge team may have relaxed when the pilot embarked and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right. There were indications that the bridge team was not truly working as one team, with the pilot using his own PPU and not effectively communicating with the rest of the bridge team. This lack of teamwork and complacency contributed to the grounding.

4. Organizational factors: The report highlights shortcomings in the safety management systems of both the ship operator and the port operator. The ship's crew did not fully follow the company's policies and procedures for navigating in pilotage waters, and the port operator's safety management system fell short of achieving good industry standards for pilot training and safety management. These organizational factors contributed to the inadequate bridge operations and overall safety culture.

5. Human factors: The report identifies several human factors that contributed to the grounding, including teamwork, complacency, situational awareness, alerting, and safety culture. These factors highlight the importance of effective communication, vigilance, and a strong safety culture in preventing accidents.

This lack of training and formal procedures for maintaining and updating the PPUs contributed to the inadequate use of electronic navigation aids and the loss of situational awareness.
Themes for 2018_204: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Distraction and loss of situational awareness: The skipper became distracted by simultaneously following a pod of dolphins and giving a passenger commentary, leading to a loss of situational awareness and the vessel running aground on rocks.

2. Lack of safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions when skippers were working alone in the wheelhouse.

3. Ineffective use of electronic navigation aids: The skipper and some other skippers in the operator's fleet did not routinely use the electronic navigation aids to their full effect, which could have prevented the grounding. There were available features, such as geo-fencing hazards and setting depth sounder alarms, that were not utilized effectively.

4. Lack of defenses and risk mitigation: The skipper was effectively working alone in a high-risk situation without sufficient defenses in place to prevent errors that led to the grounding.

5. Actions taken by the operator: The operator has implemented safety actions to minimize the risk of distractions and improve navigation safety, such as prohibiting significant commentary while navigating and requiring a second crew member in the wheelhouse in certain cases.
Themes for 2018_205: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate safety measures: The report highlights that the safety measures in place relied heavily on administrative controls and operator compliance, rather than engineering controls. The guarding solutions were difficult to fit, resulting in a lack of interlocked guarding and inadequate labeling of emergency stops. This led to increased risks and confusion among the crew.

2. Lack of risk assessment: The accumulator, which posed an injury risk, did not have its own risk assessment or safe operating procedure. The hazards associated with the vertical movement of the accumulator floor and framework were not identified and assessed. This lack of risk assessment contributed to the accident.

3. Impairment and fitness for duty: The report suggests that the freezerman's decision-making abilities may have been adversely affected by some form of impairment, potentially due to the consumption of methamphetamine. The use of performance-impairing substances and the risk of fatigue were identified as hazards to the correct functioning of the machinery and the safety of the crew.

4. Inadequate drug and alcohol policy: The operator's drug and alcohol policy, although over and above industry guidelines, did not effectively deter crew members from using illicit drugs at sea. The testing regime was not able to detect substances like methamphetamine, which can be cleared from the body in a matter of days.

5. Fatigue and stress: The shift pattern of six hours on and six hours off, combined with the potential consumption of stimulant drugs, raised the risk of fatigue-related accidents. The report highlights the importance of fatigue management and the need for crew members to be aware of the effects of fatigue on their performance and judgment.

6. Lack of communication and training: There was confusion among the crew regarding the emergency stops and their configuration. The investigation found that poor awareness of the emergency stop configuration had been passed on through training. This lack of communication and training contributed to the confusion and potential access to running machinery after pressing an incorrect emergency stop.
Themes for 2018_206: 
Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Environmental conditions: The report mentions that the prevailing winds were from the east, which was not usual for the port. The wind direction and strength, along with the sustained wind and sea conditions, may have contributed to the incident.
2. Vessel maneuverability: The wind acting on the starboard side of the vessel caused the stern to move to port, resulting in the vessel veering to starboard. The reduction in engine speed and propeller wash past the rudder further reduced the vessel's maneuverability.
3. Bridge resource management: The level of bridge resource management on the bridge did not meet industry good practice. There was a lack of communication and teamwork among the bridge team, and no specific pilot plan or monitoring parameters were in place to address the weather conditions and deviations from the plan.
4. Pilot training and proficiency: The pilot was overdue for an annual assessment of proficiency, indicating that South Port's pilot assessment regime was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan.
5. Readiness of critical standby equipment: The anchors did not deploy when ordered by the pilot, and it could not be established why they failed to do so. The operator's safety management system categorized the anchor windlasses as critical standby equipment, but the cause of the malfunction could not be determined.
6. Electronic navigational aids: The absence of electronic charting and information aids, such as ECDIS or portable pilot units, limited the bridge team's situational awareness and ability to predict the vessel's movements and stay within safe navigation zones.
Themes for 2019_201: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Mechanical failure: The accident was caused by a mechanical failure in the jet unit steering system, specifically the breaking of stud-bolts that rendered the steering nozzle and reverse bucket ineffective. The failure was due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient pre-tension in the stud-bolts.

2. Maintenance system failure: The operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the manufacturers' specifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system. The torque on the stud-bolts had not been checked, and other nuts in the jet unit assembly were not tightened using a torque wrench.

3. Hazard identification failure: The operator's hazard identification system did not identify the risk that a system critical to the safety of the jet boat could fail. The hazards identified primarily related to operating conditions and driver performance, but not to maintenance and safety critical systems.

Themes for 2019_203: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Overload of the foot wire: The foot wire failed as a result of overload, causing the securing equipment to strike an able-bodied seaman. The load being applied by the crane, when multiplied by the configuration of the blocks, was sufficient to overload the foot wire.

2. Lack of proper procedures and equipment: Turnbuckles were not rigged between the wiggle wire and foot wires, which meant that the crane was used to tension the wiggle wire. The crew did not identify the hazards associated with wires under tension and had not implemented appropriate mitigation measures. The cargo securing manual did not provide guidance on a safe system of work for cargo-securing operations.

3. Ineffective safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not include a safety assessment of cargo-securing operations. This resulted in ineffective controls to mitigate the risks to the crew when completing these tasks. The operator had not undertaken a fulsome risk assessment for log-securing operations, leading to a lack of guidance on the dangers associated with wires under tension and other hazards.
Themes for 2019_204: 
Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Insufficient consideration of weather conditions: The operator did not have defined weather criteria in their Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP), leading to the skipper making a critical safety decision without any criteria to assess it. This lack of consideration of weather conditions increased the likelihood of the accident occurring.
2. Lack of risk assessment for capsize: The operator did not assess the risk of a capsize occurring and did not have documented controls in place to prevent or minimize the consequences of a capsize. This lack of risk assessment and control measures contributed to the vessel being overwhelmed by steep and unpredictable seas.
3. Self-perceived pressure to operate: The absence of communication facilities at Freshwater Hut resulted in a self-perceived pressure on the skipper to pick up the passengers.

Themes for 2020_201: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of situational awareness: Both the bridge team on board the Rose Harmony and the watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo had low situational awareness of other marine traffic in the vicinity. This was due to factors such as distraction, improper use of radar equipment, and failure to plot the track of the other vessel.

2. Poor bridge resource management: The situational awareness of the bridge team on the Rose Harmony was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters.

3. Inadequate training: The deckhand keeping watch on board the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to be left in sole charge of the watch. The training system for deckhands in watchkeeping practices was not consistent with the requirements of Maritime Rules, leading to a lack of understanding of the risks and proper actions to be taken.

4. Failure to follow collision-prevention rules: The collision between the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo occurred because neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules. Both vessels were power-driven vessels in a head-on situation that required each to alter its course to starboard.

5. Distraction and presence of non-essential personnel: The presence of passengers on the bridge of the Rose Harmony and the distraction caused by their presence affected the bridge team's ability to manage the conduct of the vessel effectively. This highlights the importance of controlling access to the bridge to prevent distractions.

6. Inadequate use of radar equipment: Both vessels failed to properly use radar equipment, including long-range scanning, to obtain early warning of the risk of collision. This contributed to the low situational awareness and failure to detect the other vessel in a timely manner.
Themes for 2020_202: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Malfunctioning main engine: The main engine of the vessel was unable to generate full power due to a malfunctioning fuel injection control unit. This resulted in the vessel losing control and deviating from the channel.

2. Ineffective communication: There was a lack of effective communication between the master and chief engineer, leading to the master being unaware of the malfunctioning main engine prior to departure. This lack of communication hindered the bridge team's ability to address the issue and inform the pilot.

3. Adverse environmental conditions: The vessel embarked on a pilotage passage in marginal environmental conditions, which exceeded the safety considerations in the pilotage plan. The combination of the malfunctioning main engine and adverse environmental conditions rendered the vessel's navigational control ineffective.

4. Crew resource management: There was a lack of departmental communication between the engine room and the bridge, specifically between the master and chief engineer. This lack of communication hindered the flow of safety-critical information and affected the decision-making process.

5. Port of Tauranga safe operating procedures: The environmental conditions at the time of departure were at the upper end of the allowable limits described in the port's safety management plan. The vessel's main engine malfunction was not relayed to the pilot prior to departure, highlighting the need for a reassessment of the allowable weather windows for pilotage.

6. Injection control unit malfunction: The malfunction of the injection control unit was likely caused by coking debris that had entered the system and interfered with the operation of the valves. The use of low-sulphur fuel contributed to the coking and affected the performance of the marine diesel engine. The lack of a comprehensive document addressing the effects of low-sulphur fuel on injection control unit maintenance further complicated the situation.
Themes for 2020_204: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of situational awareness: The crew member's reduced situational awareness of their own safety led to them stepping too close to the mooring winch and getting trapped between the rope and the winch drum.

2. Operational limitation of the mooring winch: The mooring winch had not been operated as recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and this increased the risk of injury to the crew operating the winch. The presence of transverse bars on the winch reduced the clearance and increased the risk of the rope getting stuck.

3. Inadequate risk assessment for unmooring operations: The risk assessment for mooring and unmooring operations on board the vessel did not comply with the company's safety management system. There was a lack of sufficient personnel, blind spots on the mooring deck, and a lack of training and experience that were not properly mitigated.

4. Lack of proper communication and coordination: The crew did not conduct a proper toolbox meeting to discuss hazards and mitigation strategies before commencing the unmooring operation. This led to a lack of communication between the winch operator and the crew handling the ropes, increasing the risk of accidents.

5. Inadequate implementation and auditing of the safety management system: The safe job analysis for mooring operations deviated from the intent of the safety management system, indicating that there were control measures lacking or insufficiently mitigating the identified risks. This suggests a need for improvement in internal and external audits of the safety management system.

6. Insufficient planning and coordination of unmooring operations: The forward mooring team did not sufficiently plan the unmooring operations to mitigate the risk of crew members operating in blind spots. A proper toolbox meeting may have identified the need for changes in the unmooring plan to address the reduction in crewing available on the forward mooring deck.
Themes for 2020_205: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Failure to implement hot-work precautions: The ship's crew did not fully implement the requirements set out in the safety management system and the hot-work permit, leading to a lack of supervision and readiness of firefighting equipment.

2. Ignition source and fire spread: The fire was likely ignited by molten material from gas-cutting activities, which ignited nearby sawdust. The tight stowage of the cargo made it difficult to control the ejection of hot slag beads and sparks, contributing to the fire's spread.

Themes for 2021_203: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Poor standard of watchkeeping: Both vessels had poor watchkeeping practices, failing to properly assess the risk of collision and take necessary action to avoid each other. Assumptions were made about right of way and size-based expectations, leading to a lack of appropriate action.

2. Fatigue: Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor to the collision. The skipper of the F.V. Commission had been awake for approximately 20 hours and was experiencing a natural dip in alertness. Insufficient rest hours and non-compliant practices of sleeping while drifting and assuming other vessels would keep out of the way contributed to the fatigue.

3. Inadequate training and resourcing: The deckhands on the F.V. Commission were not sufficiently trained in watchkeeping, and the vessel lacked adequate crew members to manage the risk of fatigue and maintain proper watchkeeping. This issue is not uncommon in the smaller fishing fleet, indicating a broader problem in the industry.
Themes for 2021_204: 
Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of planning and preparation: The fishing trip was planned hastily and the participants were not well-prepared to survive a maritime incident. They did not bring food or extra water, and the skipper's experience was not underpinned by formal maritime training.

2. Alcohol impairment: The skipper's coordination and judgment were likely impaired by alcohol consumption. This affected their risk perception and may have led to the decision to navigate over the bar instead of taking the safer route through the South Channel.

3. Insufficient use of personal flotation devices (PFDs): Although there were enough PFDs on board, the skipper was the only one wearing one. The other two passengers removed theirs when they started fishing. If everyone had been wearing appropriate PFDs, their chances of survival would have been better.

4. Dangerous harbor bar conditions: Navigating over the bar placed the vessel at a high risk of encountering conditions in which it would be prone to capsize and swamping. The Manukau bar is known for its unpredictable and dangerous waves, and the skipper's decision to navigate over the bar instead of taking the safer route contributed to the accident.

5. Lack of regulation and licensing for recreational boaters: New Zealand's recreational boating sector has little regulation, and there is no requirement for recreational skippers to demonstrate a minimum standard of competency. This lack of regulation and licensing may contribute to unsafe boating practices and accidents.

Themes for 2022_206: 
Based on the information provided, the causes of the accident can be summarized as follows:

1. Missing sealant and hose clamp: A portion of the sealant had broken away, leaving a section of the primary vent hose connection exposed. This indicates a failure in the design and construction of the fuel system, as it did not adequately protect against hazards such as moving parts and hot surfaces.

2. Inadequate inspection of the fuel system: The survey reports did not show any inspection of the fuel system below the deck plate, and the surveyors did not identify that the secondary fuel tank vent was ineffective. The lack of specific regulatory requirements to survey the entire fuel system and the reliance on the surveyors' judgment have led to undetected high-risk deficiencies in fuel systems, increasing the potential for accidents.

3. Insufficient assurance of fuel system integrity and safety: The Maritime New Zealand survey system does not adequately assure the integrity and safety of fuel systems because the rules do not require the inspection of the complete fuel system. This lack of requirement increases the potential for hidden deficiencies and poses a potential risk to other vessels in the domestic fleet.

Overall, the accident highlights issues with the design, construction, and inspection of fuel systems, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring, periodic testing, and comprehensive inspections to ensure the safety and integrity of fuel systems on vessels.
