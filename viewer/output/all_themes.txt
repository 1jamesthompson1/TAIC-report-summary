Themes for 2019_106: 
Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it highlights the lack of effective communication between the train controller, the driver, and the onboard service manager (OSM). The train controller did not communicate with the driver after the train was wrong routed, which led to the passengers disembarking without proper oversight or protection ("the train controller did not attempt to contact the driver of train 804 after the train passed 12R signal" (3.24)). Additionally, the driver did not include the OSM in the decision-making process for passenger disembarkation, which could have provided alternative safe options ("the OSM was left out of the communication and decision-making process" (3.22)). This lack of communication increased the risk to passengers and could have been mitigated with effective communication protocols.

Inadequate Situational Awareness
Inadequate situational awareness is another safety theme relevant to this accident. The driver's partial view of the signal and subsequent actions based on incomplete information led to the wrong routing of the train ("the driver only observed a proceed signal on the bottom unit and acted on it in the expectation that the route was correctly set for the passenger train" (3.13)). Furthermore, the train controller's distraction with other tasks prevented them from setting the correct route for the passenger train ("the train controller had become distracted with other train controlling tasks" (4.1)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates how a lack of full awareness of the operational environment can lead to unsafe conditions.

Non-Technical Skills Deficiency
Non-technical skills deficiency is a safety theme that played a significant role in this accident. Despite the personnel involved having undergone training in non-technical skills, the incident showed that these skills were not effectively utilized ("the incident highlighted the dangers that can still occur when non-technical skills are not used, or not used effectively" (3.33)). The failure to confirm the full signal indication and to communicate effectively among the crew members are examples of this deficiency. The theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of non-technical skills such as communication, decision-making, and situational awareness in ensuring safe rail operations.

Procedural Non-Compliance
Procedural non-compliance is a safety theme that emerges from this accident due to the absence of a rule stipulating that passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at Rolleston and the lack of instructions for actions to take if a passenger train is berthed on the West Main Line ("there was no rule that stipulated passenger trains must travel via the East Main Line at Rolleston" (4.3)). The driver's decision to disembark passengers without consulting train control or the OSM also reflects a deviation from expected safety procedures. This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for clear and enforced procedures to guide the actions of train crews in non-standard situations.

Inadequate Risk Assessment
Inadequate risk assessment is a safety theme relevant to this accident, as evidenced by the driver's decision to allow passengers to disembark onto the ballast and cross the track without a comprehensive safety evaluation involving all responsible parties ("The driver made no attempt to contact train control after becoming aware that the train had been wrong routed" (3.20)). The driver's unilateral risk assessment did not consider the broader operational context that train control could have provided. This theme is relevant because it shows the importance of thorough risk assessments that include input from all relevant parties to ensure passenger safety.

Insufficient Training Emphasis on Safety Principles
Insufficient training emphasis on safety principles is a safety theme identified in this accident. Although all personnel involved had been trained in non-technical skills, the incident demonstrated that these principles were not at the forefront of their actions during the event ("This incident highlighted the importance of ensuring that the principles remain prominent in workers' minds as an important tool in planning for any safe-working scenario" (3.38)). The theme is relevant as it suggests that ongoing reinforcement and application of safety training are necessary to ensure that safety principles are consistently applied in practice.
Themes for 2013_107: 
Wheel-bearing Failures
Wheel-bearing failures are a critical safety theme as they can lead to derailments. In this accident, the "evidence points clearly to a wheel-bearing failure resulting in a 'screwed' axle journal and the consequential dropping of the bogie side frame onto the rail" (4.1.4). The failure of the wheel-bearing was the direct cause of the derailment (5.1), and the report discusses the processes in place to mitigate the risks of such failures (4.1.5). The wheel-bearing that failed had been in use for approximately seven years and had traveled 330,000 kilometers before failing (4.3.6), indicating that the longevity and usage of wheel-bearings are factors that need to be monitored to ensure safety.

Inadequate Monitoring Systems
The accident highlighted the inadequacy of the RailBAM system in place at the time to detect and prevent wheel-bearing failures. The RailBAM system "had the potential to have detected the pending failure of the wheel-bearing and trigger the removal of the wagon from service before the bearing failed" (5.4), but it was not fully implemented or adequately resourced to achieve this outcome. Prior to the derailment, the Te Puna RailBAM had generated 20 fault records for the failed wheelset, but no action was taken to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). This indicates that the monitoring systems in place were not effective in preventing the accident, making it a significant safety theme.

Brake System Issues
Problems with the braking system are a safety theme as they can lead to wheel and wheel-bearing damage, which in turn can cause derailments. The report suggests that "problems with the wagon's braking systems leading to an unusually high number of fused brake block events led to wheel and wheel-bearing damage" (5.2). The derailed wagon had a high incidence of brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure (4.1.6), and the frequency of unscheduled work on the wagon's brake system in 2013 was surprising, given that it was not placed on a "watch list" or removed from service (4.3.10). This indicates that issues with the brake system were a contributing factor to the accident and represent a broader safety concern.

Inspection and Maintenance Practices
Inspection and maintenance practices are a safety theme because inadequate practices can fail to detect impending failures. The scheduled inspections of the derailed wagon had been carried out at the required frequency, but neither the pre-departure inspection nor the roll-by inspection detected any signs of the impending bearing failure (4.3.3, 4.3.4). The report also notes that the visual inspection regime is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure (4.3.13). This suggests that the inspection and maintenance practices in place at the time of the accident were insufficient to detect and prevent the wheel-bearing failure that led to the derailment.

Risk Management and Response
Risk management and response is a safety theme because the lack of appropriate action in response to identified risks can lead to accidents. Despite the RailBAM system generating multiple fault records for the failed wheelset, KiwiRail did not take action to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). Additionally, there was no dedicated RailBAM analyst position or agreed process for monitoring and reviewing RailBAM data at the time of the derailment (4.4.12). This indicates that the risk management and response to the identified bearing faults were inadequate, which is a significant safety theme related to this accident.

Organizational Oversight
Organizational oversight is a safety theme as it encompasses the broader systemic issues that can lead to accidents. The report indicates that KiwiRail had not addressed the issue of high brake block replacement frequency with an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule (4.1.6), and there was no "watch list" or removal from service despite the frequency of unscheduled brake system work (4.3.10). Furthermore, the lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst and an agreed RailBAM process (4.4.12) points to organizational shortcomings in addressing safety risks. This theme is relevant as it reflects on the organizational practices and decision-making processes that failed to prevent the accident.
Themes for 2020_102: 
Compliance with Track Warrant Conditions
Compliance with track warrant conditions is a critical safety theme in this accident. The track warrant control method of protection relies on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions ("Safety issue: The track warrant control method of protection was reliant on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions" (3.6)). In this incident, the track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed the specified location before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track, leading to the collision ("The track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed Limeworks Road public level crossing before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track and in the path of the approaching train" (4.4)).

Effective Use of Crew Resource Management
Effective use of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles is another safety theme related to this accident. The train controller did not apply CRM principles effectively by not providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road ("When issuing the track warrant to the track ganger, the train controller did not apply Crew Resource Management principles by providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road" (4.3)). This lack of communication contributed to the track ganger's incorrect assumption about the train's location and subsequent unsafe actions.

Verification of Train Movements
Verification of train movements before authorizing track occupancy is a crucial safety theme. The track warrant system requires that certain conditions be met before a warrant becomes valid, such as verifying the passage of another train. In this case, the track ganger overlooked the requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the specified mark before the track warrant became valid ("The requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the 429 km mark before the track warrant became valid was overlooked entirely" (3.21)). This oversight directly led to the hi-rail vehicle being on the track at the time of the collision.

Adherence to Operating Rules and Procedures
Adherence to operating rules and procedures is a safety theme that was not followed, contributing to the accident. The train controller issued the track warrant in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures, but the track ganger failed to adhere to these rules by not ensuring the departing train had cleared the area ("The train controller issued a track warrant to the track ganger conditional on the departure of Train 932 from Limeworks Road, in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures" (4.2)). This non-adherence to procedures resulted in the hi-rail vehicle being in the path of the oncoming train.

Decision-Making in Emergency Situations
Decision-making in emergency situations is a safety theme that played a role in the severity of the accident. The train driver chose to apply full-service braking instead of emergency braking, which would have reduced the train's speed more rapidly and possibly lessened the severity of the impact ("The train driver decided to make a full-service brake application rather than apply the emergency brakes, and as a result the train struck the hi-rail vehicle at a higher speed and took longer to stop than it would have had the emergency brake been applied" (4.5)). The driver's decision-making in this emergency situation affected the outcome of the accident.

Technological Defenses Against Human Error
The lack of technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The track warrant control system relies on compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms, and the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses ("however, the track warrant control system is reliant on the level of compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms and read back to train controllers. the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error" (3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This reliance on human compliance without technological backup increases the risk of accidents due to human error, as seen in this incident.
Themes for 2011_003: 
Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control
Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control is a safety theme that involves the helicopter's main rotor blades diverging from their normal plane of rotation, leading to a loss of control and potential in-flight break-up. This theme is relevant to the accident as the evidence indicated that "the main rotor blades had flapped up and down to the limit stops and the blades had flexed beyond their normal flexible range, causing permanent creases on the upper and lower surfaces" and "both main rotor blades had struck and separated the tail boom" (4.2.27). The report also states that "the cause of the in-flight break-up was main rotor blade divergence caused by a possible combination of the following factors: the helicopter entering low-gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of turbulence), turbulence, excessive movements of the cyclic control, low main rotor blade RPM" (5.2).

Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters
Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters is a safety theme that involves the lack of sufficient guidance and mandatory requirements from the regulatory body to minimize the risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report identifies that "The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations" (5.5). The report also highlights differences in regulatory approaches between the FAA and CAA, particularly after 1998, which may have influenced the accident rates in the respective countries (4.3.18).

Flight manual clarity and terminology
Flight manual clarity and terminology is a safety theme that concerns the way critical safety information is presented in the flight manual, including the use of terms like "Warning" and "Caution." This theme is relevant to the accident as the report finds that "The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and situations that could result in serious injury or death" (5.6). The report also notes that the flight manual's "Limitations" section did not mention any airspeed limit for the helicopter in turbulent and windy conditions, which is a critical safety aspect given the R22's susceptibility to in-flight break-ups in such conditions (4.3.36).

Turbulence and wind conditions
Turbulence and wind conditions is a safety theme that involves the impact of atmospheric conditions on helicopter flight, particularly for light helicopters like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter was flying in conditions of "strong wind and moderate to extreme turbulence" at the time it broke up in flight (5.1). The report also mentions that "turbulence was likely to have been one of the main factors contributing to the in-flight break-up" (4.2.15).

ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices
ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices is a safety theme that involves the reliability of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) during crashes and the use of flight tracking devices to locate downed aircraft. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter's ELT activated but was severely damaged and unable to transmit a usable location signal (4.4.3). The report also acknowledges the common concern of ELT failures after crashes and the potential benefits of flight tracking devices, which in this case, guided search aircraft to the general location of the crash (4.4.4, 4.4.11).

Pilot experience and training
Pilot experience and training is a safety theme that involves the level of knowledge and skill pilots have, particularly when flying helicopters with known handling characteristics and limitations like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report suggests that "The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence" (5.4). The report also highlights the diversity in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and the theory behind the Robinson safety awareness training (4.3.25).
Themes for 2012_105: 
Human Error in Manual Route Setting
Human error in manual route setting is a significant safety theme as it directly contributed to the wrong-routing of the train. The report states that "the train controller was qualified to control any of the Auckland control zones and was familiar with multitasking between the zones and across several computer screens," yet he made a mistake in setting the route manually due to the increased risk of human error during the morning peak train control workload (4.2.1, 4.2.2). This theme is relevant because the train controllers were in a transition period, becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line and were required to set routes manually, which increased the risk of error (5.1, 5.2).

Misinterpretation of Signals by Train Driver
Misinterpretation of signals by the train driver is another safety theme. The driver, despite being qualified and familiar with the route, failed to recognize that the signal was indicating a wrong route for his train. The report notes that "the driver assumed that the route ahead had been correctly set for his train" and "selectively read the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803 but did not recognize that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risk associated with drivers making assumptions about their routes and the importance of correctly interpreting signals to prevent accidents.

Inadequate Communication During Recovery
Inadequate communication during the recovery process is a critical safety theme. The report identifies a safety issue where "the radio communication between the train controller and the train driver was open loop," leading to a situation where "neither party really understood the other's intentions" (4.4). This miscommunication resulted in the train being driven back towards Puhinui Station without the required protection from other train movements, creating a potential head-on collision with another passenger train (5.4, 5.5). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that clear and precise instructions were not issued at a critical moment, which could have averted the violation of rail operating rules (5.6).

Lack of Automatic Route Setting
The lack of automatic route setting is a safety theme that underpins the incident. At the time of the incident, "train controllers had to set routes manually because the construction works at Wiri Junction were still in progress" (4.2.2). The report indicates that KiwiRail planned to provide automatic route setting within the train control system, which would have reduced the likelihood of a wrong-route being set (4.2.8). This theme is relevant as the manual setting of routes was a temporary measure until the completion of track layout changes, and the subsequent commissioning of automatic route setting has since reduced the risk of such incidents.

Training and Familiarity with Safety Procedures
Training and familiarity with safety procedures is a safety theme that emerges from the driver's actions during the incident. The driver had been trained in the use of the SWA-01 procedure required for setting back a train, but had not used one in his two years of driving. The report suggests that "he should have been familiar enough with the rules to realise that what he was about to do required a SWA-01 procedure to be completed before setting his train back" (4.4.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of not only training but also the practical application and familiarity with safety procedures to ensure they are followed correctly in real-world situations.

Crew Resource Management and Standardized Communication
Crew resource management and standardized communication is a safety theme that is highlighted by the report's findings on the need for clear communication and the use of all available resources to ensure safe operations. The report discusses the concept of crew resource management, where "rail participants make use of all the resources available to ensure they all work with consistent information to ensure a successful execution of the plan/task" (4.4.6). The relevance of this theme is demonstrated by the incident, which serves as an example of the need for improvement in the way some rail participants are communicating, particularly during non-routine operations (4.4.8).
Themes for 2019_202: 
Operating Conditions and Environmental Factors
Operating conditions and environmental factors are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the jet boat was operating under "unfavourable conditions" (3.3) and specifically in "flat light conditions" which degraded the driver's ability to identify obstacles in the water (3.9, 3.10). The river level was also lower than usual, increasing the risk of submerged rocks and other obstacles being exposed (3.11). These conditions made it more challenging to navigate safely, highlighting the importance of adapting speed and operational decisions to the environment.

Alcohol Impairment
Alcohol impairment is a significant safety theme in this accident. The driver's "blood alcohol concentration was about three times the legal blood alcohol limit for driving a car on the road" (3.18), and the Commission found that alcohol consumption "almost certainly impaired the driver's ability to make good decisions and to operate the jet boat safely" (4.4). Despite the driver's confidence in their ability to navigate, the alcohol in their bloodstream "had almost certainly impaired their ability to make good decisions" (3.20), which is a critical factor in the accident's occurrence.

Speed and Navigation
Speed and navigation are crucial safety themes as the jet boat was traveling at a speed of "about 35-50 kilometres per hour" (3.13), which was not adjusted to match the deteriorating light conditions (3.14). The Commission suggests that a reduced speed would have likely provided "more time to identify any hazards ahead of the boat" (3.15) and could have lessened the impact's consequences (3.16). The driver's failure to adjust speed according to the conditions contributed to the accident's severity.

Experience and Familiarity with the Route
The driver's experience and familiarity with the route are safety themes because, although the driver was experienced, they did not possess the same level of knowledge as a commercial jet boat driver and were not anticipating the gravel bar in the river (3.12). This lack of specific knowledge about the safer route through the river contributed to the accident, as the driver attempted to navigate a shallower and more hazardous channel.

Use of Safety Equipment
The use of safety equipment is a relevant safety theme because, despite the accident, the driver had essential lifesaving and communication equipment on board, including a personal locator beacon (3.2). The activation of the beacon and the subsequent search and rescue operation demonstrate the importance of carrying such equipment. However, the presence of safety equipment did not prevent the accident, indicating that while essential, equipment alone is not sufficient to ensure safety without proper operational decisions.

Data and Regulatory Oversight
Data and regulatory oversight are safety themes because there is "limited data to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug use in the new zealand recreational maritime sector and its impacts on recreational boating accidents" (3.16). The lack of specific powers to test recreational boat drivers for alcohol or drugs after accidents (3.21) and the absence of enforceable drug and alcohol limits in the recreational sector (3.25) are regulatory gaps that hinder the understanding and management of such safety risks. The Commission has made recommendations to address these issues, emphasizing the need for improved data and regulations (3.26, 3.27).
Themes for 2010_010: 
Hydraulic System Contamination
Hydraulic system contamination is a safety theme relevant to this accident because debris in the hydraulic fluid was identified as the primary cause of the nose landing gear's failure to fully extend. The report states that "The failure of the nose landing gear to extend fully was most likely caused by debris in the hydraulic fluid blocking orifices within the nose landing gear extend/retract hydraulic actuator" (5.1). Additionally, the debris was likely from "damaged seals within the actuator" (5.1), and the presence of metallic particles and organic compounds in the fluid was confirmed by analyses (4.6). This contamination compromised the reliability of the landing gear system, directly impacting the safety of the aircraft during landing operations.

Faulty Down-Lock Verification System
The faulty down-lock verification system is a significant safety theme because it provided the pilots with a false indication that the nose landing gear was fully extended and locked when it was not. The report highlights that "With the nose landing gear stuck in a partially extended position, light from the taxi light was likely detected by the sensor for the down-lock verification system, causing it to give a false green light" (5.4). This false indication led the pilots to believe that the landing gear was secure, as evidenced by the captain's confidence in the verification system and the saying "a green is a green" (4.19). The unreliability of the verification system is underscored by the report's finding that "The verification system for checking if the landing gear is down and locked on the Dash 8 series of aircraft is not reliable enough for pilots to place total trust in it" (5.6).

Inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM)
Inadequate CRM is a safety theme in this accident, as the crew did not fully utilize all available resources to verify the status of the nose landing gear. The report indicates that "The pilots did not use all of the available resources to confirm the nose landing gear position" (5.10). This includes not asking the controller to confirm the status of the nose landing gear, which could have led to further action to secure it (5.10). Additionally, the report discusses the pilots' failure to communicate effectively and use problem-solving techniques, such as not informing the flight attendant of the abnormal gear indication and not performing a go-around in response to the aural warnings (4.43, 5.9).

Inadequate Maintenance Procedures
Inadequate maintenance procedures are a safety theme because the report suggests that the maintenance response to reported defects was not effective in identifying the true cause of the defects, which contributed to the incident. The report states that "maintenance action might initially fail to identify the true cause of a defect" (4.16) and that the intermittent nature of previous defects might now be recognized as symptomatic of fluid contamination or an actuator defect (4.13). Furthermore, the report notes that the "on-condition maintenance process should prevent the failure or degradation of a component from causing an operational incident" (4.15), implying that the existing maintenance processes were insufficient in preventing the incident.

Design Flaws in Aircraft Systems
Design flaws in aircraft systems are a safety theme because the report identifies issues with the design of the landing gear verification system that contributed to the incident. The report discusses the design of the verification system that falsely indicated the nose landing gear was down and locked (4.3) and the manufacturer's lack of recognition of the possibility of stray light activating the sensor (4.21). The Commission recommended that the manufacturer improve the reliability and dependability of the landing gear down-lock verification system (4.24), highlighting the need to address design flaws that can lead to safety risks.

Response to Aural and Visual Warnings
The response to aural and visual warnings is a safety theme because the pilots' reaction to the warnings was influenced by the false verification light, leading them to disregard genuine warnings. The report notes that the pilots disregarded the landing gear warning horn and the ground proximity warning system alert due to their belief that the verification system was correct (4.33). The pilots' decision not to perform a go-around after receiving the aural warnings is highlighted as a missed opportunity to reassess the situation (5.9). This theme emphasizes the importance of appropriately responding to warnings and the potential consequences of misinterpreting or ignoring them.
Themes for 2013_011: 
Runway Excursions
Runway excursions are events where an aircraft departs the runway during takeoff or landing and are considered 'serious incidents' due to their potential to cause significant damage and fatal injuries ("Runway excursions" 4.1). This theme is relevant to the accident because the incident involved an uncommanded turn during takeoff, which led to the aircraft leaving the runway, albeit without injuries or damage due to the crew's appropriate response and the presence of a safe run-off area ("In this incident there were no injuries or damage because the crew responded appropriately and the aeroplane departed the runway at slow speed" 4.2).


Steering System Failure
Steering system failure is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the pilot's ability to control the aircraft during ground operations. In this incident, the uncommanded turn to the left was caused by a faulty steering selector ("The uncommanded turn to the left was determined to have been caused by a faulty steering selector" 4.6). The failure of the steering system is particularly relevant to this accident as it was the primary cause of the runway excursion.


Maintenance and Overhaul Practices
Maintenance and overhaul practices are essential for ensuring the reliability of aircraft components. The steering selector involved in this incident had been overhauled, but the overhaul records did not indicate that the springs in the spring box were replaced ("There was no record that the springs in the spring box were replaced at this time" 4.9). The overhaul facility's practice of not retaining detailed test records also contributed to the inability to determine the defective component within the steering selector ("Because the overhaul facility's test and inspection reports lacked sufficient detail, it could not be determined whether the springs or the rocker spring plungers were the cause of the steering incident at Auckland" 4.14). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of thorough maintenance records and practices in preventing component failures.


Component Life Cycle Management
Managing the life cycle of aircraft components is crucial to prevent failures due to wear and tear. The steering selector had an allowable service life of 10,000 landings or six years, whichever came first, and the incident occurred after 931 landings over 16 months ("The allowable service life was 10,000 landings or six years, whichever came first" 4.6). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that the springs, which were suspected to have caused the fault, were reused during the last overhaul and were not replaced due to common practice and maintenance manual permissions ("According to the overhaul facility the reuse of springs was common practice and permitted by the maintenance manual" 4.9).


Incident Response and Crew Training
The response of the crew to an incident and their training are critical safety themes. In this case, the captain's decision to stop the take-off was timely and correct, and the crew's control of the aircraft using various methods ensured that the airplane was at a slow speed when it left the runway ("The captain's decision to stop the take-off was timely and correct" 4.5). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the importance of crew training and decision-making in mitigating the consequences of an incident.


Component Failure Analysis and Reporting
The analysis and reporting of component failures are vital for understanding the causes of incidents and preventing future occurrences. In this incident, the fault was traced to incorrect spring tensions within the steering selector, which affected the internal hydraulic pressure ("The examination of the steering selector after the incident traced the fault to incorrect spring tensions within the spring box of the steering selector" 4.7). However, due to incomplete overhaul records, the specific defective component could not be determined ("The defective component within the steering selector could not be determined because of incomplete overhaul records" 5.2). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for detailed failure analysis and reporting to enhance safety through better understanding and prevention of component failures.
Themes for 2015_103: 
Role Overload and Conflicting Responsibilities
The safety theme of role overload and conflicting responsibilities is highlighted by the fact that the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader to also take on the safety-critical role of rail protection officer. This dual role placed an excessive burden on one individual, which is not conducive to maintaining high safety standards. The report states that "the responsibility for overseeing the sleeper replacement project and ensuring the safety of the workers should never have been placed on one person" (4.2.1). The rail protection officer was under considerable pressure due to his responsibilities as team leader, which contributed to the incident (4.2.2). KiwiRail later introduced a plan to separate the roles of rail protection officer and work supervisor (team leader) to reduce the risks of track occupation incidents (4.2.9).

Non-Technical Skills Deficiency
Non-technical skills, such as teamwork, communication, and situational awareness, were identified as a safety issue because none of the workers, including the production manager, had been trained in or had any knowledge of KiwiRail's non-technical skills practices (4.3). The lack of non-technical skills training among the workers could have prevented the incident, as these skills help mitigate and manage errors (4.3.3). The report suggests that if the workers had been trained in non-technical skills, they might have questioned the rail protection officer about the whereabouts of the passenger train, which could have prevented the incident (4.3.7, 4.3.8).

Inadequate Scaffolding and Project Delays
The safety theme of inadequate scaffolding and project delays is relevant because the sleeper replacement project was behind schedule, which was partly due to insufficient equipment provided for scaffolding the entire length of the bridge (4.2.3). The need to move scaffolding along small sections of the bridge each day added about two hours of work, adversely affecting the project timeline and contributing to the pressure felt by the rail protection officer (4.2.3).

Organisational and Management Pressure
Organisational and management pressure is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. The rail protection officer was being closely monitored by the production manager and the area engineering manager due to previous performance issues (4.2.4). The presence of the managers on-site increased the pressure on the rail protection officer, who was already overwhelmed with managing all aspects of the project (4.2.5). This pressure likely contributed to the lapse in memory and distraction that led to the error (4.2.6).

Substance Use and Impairment
Substance use and impairment is a critical safety theme as the rail protection officer tested positive for methamphetamine during a post-incident drug and alcohol test (4.4). Although it was unlikely that the rail protection officer was impaired at the time of the incident, the fact that he had not been tested for 10 years indicates that KiwiRail's random testing policy may not have been a sufficient deterrent (4.4.9). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail increase the percentage of random testing to enhance the deterrent effect (4.4.10).

Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a safety theme that emerges from the incident, as the rail protection officer was communicating with the train controller and recording event times in his log book within his vehicle, which was not equipped with external speakers. This setup excluded the workers from hearing the radio transmissions and being aware of the authorisation details for train movements through the worksite (4.3.6). Better communication, possibly facilitated by non-technical skills training, could have prevented the incident by ensuring all workers were informed of the situation (4.3.8).
Themes for 2019_201: 
Mechanical Failure
Mechanical failure is a safety theme that refers to the malfunction or breakdown of mechanical systems, which can lead to loss of control or other hazardous situations. In the case of the Discovery 2 accident, the mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control, resulting in the boat making heavy contact with the canyon wall ("a mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control" (3.3)). The stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit broke due to fatigue cracking, which was a direct cause of the accident ("The stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit failed due to fatigue cracking" (4.3)). This theme is relevant because the mechanical integrity of the boat's steering system was critical to its safe operation, and its failure was the proximate cause of the accident.

Maintenance Procedures
Maintenance procedures encompass the processes and standards used to ensure that equipment is kept in good working order and operates safely. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications ("The operator's maintenance system did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications" (4.5)). Specifically, a torque wrench was not used during routine maintenance to tighten the nuts on the stud-bolts to the specified value recommended by the manufacturer of the jet unit, leading to insufficient pre-tension and eventual failure ("Insufficient pre-tension on the stud-bolts resulted because a torque wrench was not used during routine maintenance to tighten the nuts on the stud-bolts to the specified value recommended by the manufacturer of the jet unit" (4.4)).

Hazard Identification and Risk Mitigation
Hazard identification and risk mitigation involve recognizing potential sources of danger and implementing measures to prevent accidents or minimize their impact. This safety theme is particularly relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's hazard identification and mitigation system had not identified that the failure of the propulsion and steering system was a risk to the safety of the jet boat operation ("The operator's hazard identification and mitigation system had not identified that the failure of the propulsion and steering system was a risk to the safety of the jet boat operation" (4.6)). As a result, there were no risk mitigation measures in place when the jet unit failed, which contributed to the severity of the accident.

Regulatory Compliance
Regulatory compliance refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, and guidelines that govern operations. In the context of the Discovery 2 accident, the operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82, which mandated a maintenance program for every jet boat and propulsion unit ("The operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82: Commercial Jet Boat Operations - River" (3.10)). However, the operator's maintenance program did not fully comply with these rules, as it failed to ensure that the jet unit's components were maintained to the manufacturer's specifications, highlighting a gap in regulatory compliance.

Operator Training and Performance
Operator training and performance are critical to ensuring that personnel are capable of safely managing equipment and responding to emergencies. While the actions of the jet boat driver in the Discovery 2 accident were not contributory ("The actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory to the accident" (4.1)), the theme is still relevant as it underscores the importance of having well-trained operators who can effectively manage unforeseen mechanical failures or other emergencies. The driver's ability to respond efficiently and effectively after the accident was a positive aspect of the operator's training and performance ("In this accident, the actions of the jet boat driver and the operator's response to the accident were both efficient and effective" (3.25)).

Equipment Design and Survivability
Equipment design and survivability pertain to the inherent safety features of equipment and its ability to protect occupants in the event of an accident. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident as the survivability of the boat was a significant recovery risk control available to jet boat operators ("A significant recovery risk control available to jet boat operators is the survivability of the boats" (3.34)). The design of the Discovery 2, including compliance with requirements for side deck height and the absence of projections and sharp edges, likely prevented more severe injuries or ejections from the boat during the accident ("The Discovery 2 complied with that requirement, which likely prevented one passenger being completely ejected from the boat into the water" (3.37)). However, the lack of padded seat backs may have aggravated some injuries, indicating that design improvements could enhance survivability ("However, it is likely that some injuries were aggravated when passengers were thrown into the unpadded seat backs in front of them" (3.38)).
Themes for 2013_006: 
Runway and Taxiway Lighting Intensity
The theme of runway and taxiway lighting intensity is relevant to this accident because the intensities of the taxiway centreline lights and the runway lights at the time of the incident did not meet the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommended settings. "The intensities of the taxiway centreline lights and the runway lights at the time of the incident did not meet those recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization" (5.3). This discrepancy in lighting intensity could potentially affect a pilot's ability to accurately align the aircraft on the runway centerline, as proper lighting provides critical visual cues for ground maneuvering.

Reporting of Incidents
Reporting of incidents is a significant safety theme because the captain's decision not to report the misalignment incident to the tower controller put subsequent flights at risk from debris on the runway. "The captain's decision to not report the incident to the tower controller as soon as practicable after take-off put the following flights at risk from debris contaminating the runway" (5.5). Timely reporting of incidents is crucial for ensuring that any hazards, such as debris, are promptly addressed to maintain runway safety.

Adherence to Safety Standards
Adherence to safety standards is a critical theme as the report identified variances from ICAO standards in the lighting systems at Auckland Airport, which could contribute to pilot error. "adherence to the icao standards provides pilots anywhere in the world with consistent cues for ground maneuvering, so any variance from the standards can contribute to a pilot making an error" (4.4.12 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Ensuring that aerodrome lighting and other safety-critical systems comply with international standards is essential for preventing accidents.

Use of On-board Navigation Systems
The use of on-board navigation systems is a relevant safety theme because the pilots did not utilize available navigation features that could have indicated the aircraft's position relative to the runway centerline. "The aeroplane had some navigation system features that could have shown the aeroplane's position relative to the runway centreline" (4.2.12). The failure to use these systems reduced the opportunity for the pilots to recognize their misalignment before take-off.

Pilot Procedures and Checklists
Pilot procedures and checklists are a pertinent safety theme as the captain lost situational awareness while conducting last-minute checks, leading to the misalignment. "While the pilots were conducting last-minute checks and tasks before the take-off, the captain lost awareness of precisely where his aeroplane was in relation to the runway centreline" (5.1). Proper execution of checklists and maintaining situational awareness during critical phases of flight are essential to prevent such incidents.

Regulatory Framework Ambiguity
Regulatory framework ambiguity is a safety theme because the report highlights administrative errors and phraseology differences in the advisory circular AC139-6 that could lead to inconsistent application of compliance with aerodrome design requirements. "The Commission is concerned that [administrative errors and differences] could contribute to accidents in the future" (5.4). Clarity and precision in regulatory documents are necessary to ensure that safety standards are uniformly understood and applied.
Themes for 2010_009: 
Weight and Balance Management
Weight and balance management is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the aircraft's handling characteristics and controllability. In this accident, the aircraft's center of gravity was "at least 0.122m rear of the maximum permissible limit," which created a tendency for the nose to pitch up and was the "most significant factor contributing to the accident" (5.7). The aircraft also became airborne early and at too low an airspeed to prevent uncontrollable nose-up pitch (5.2). The pilots failed to conduct weight and balance calculations on the aircraft, resulting in the aircraft being routinely flown overweight and outside the aft center of gravity allowable limit whenever it carried 8 parachutists (5.9).

Compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
Compliance with civil aviation rules is a fundamental safety theme to ensure that aircraft operations adhere to established safety standards. In this case, the aeroplane owner and their pilots did not comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow good, sound aviation practice by failing to conduct weight and balance calculations on the aeroplane (5.9). Additionally, the engineering company that modified the aircraft for parachuting operations did not follow proper processes required by civil aviation rules and guidance (5.4). The flight manual for the aircraft had not been updated to reflect its new role, limiting its usefulness for calculating weight and balance (5.5).

Aircraft Modification and Certification
Aircraft modification and certification are crucial to ensuring that any changes to an aircraft's configuration do not adversely affect its airworthiness. The engineering company involved in the conversion of the aircraft did not obtain permission for several modifications, and the documentation covering the modification was incomplete (4.3.4, 4.3.5). The flight manual was not amended as required, and it contained obsolete data related to its former agricultural role (4.3.6). These oversights in the modification and certification process could have safety implications for the aircraft's operation.

Pilot Training and Competency
Pilot training and competency are essential for safe aircraft operation, particularly when new types of aircraft or operational roles are introduced. The pilot in this accident was considered competent and had completed conversion training, including several parachute-drop flights under observation (4.6.7). However, the pilots should have made a full weight and balance calculation before each flight, which they did not do (5.8). This oversight suggests a gap in the training or adherence to training that directly impacted the safety of the flight.

Regulatory Oversight
Regulatory oversight ensures that aviation operations are conducted safely and in accordance with established standards. In this case, the CAA's oversight and surveillance of commercial parachuting were not adequate to ensure that operators were functioning in a safe manner (4.6.16). The CAA had mechanisms to regulate the parachuting industry but did not effectively use them pending the introduction of Rule Part 115 (4.6.16). The accident highlighted the need for the regulator to maintain good oversight of aircraft modifications and airworthiness (4.5.7).

Use of Safety Restraints
The use of safety restraints is a safety theme that can reduce injuries and save lives in survivable accidents. Although the impact in this accident was not survivable, the use of safety restraints could prevent passengers from sliding rearward and altering the aircraft's center of gravity, which could be a factor in other accidents (4.8.2). The reluctance of some parachutists to wear safety restraints due to fear of getting caught up indicates a need for education and potentially the development of restraint systems that are suitable for parachuting operations (4.8.3).
Themes for 2019_204: 
Weather Criteria and Decision Making
Weather criteria are essential for making informed decisions about whether to operate a vessel safely. In the case of the Henerata, the absence of predefined weather criteria in the operator's Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP) meant that the skipper had to make a critical safety decision without any specific criteria to assess the weather conditions against. "The operator had not included predefined weather criteria in its MTOP" (3.26). This lack of criteria could lead to inconsistent decision-making and potentially unsafe operations, as skippers are left to rely solely on their own judgment without a standardized reference. "If the operator had developed and set predefined weather criteria, all the appropriate considerations in this incident would have been taken into account, resulting in a more consistent approach to deciding when to sail" (3.25).

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management are crucial for preventing accidents and minimizing their consequences. The operator of the Henerata did not assess the risk of a capsize occurring, which meant there were no documented controls in place to prevent a capsize or to minimize the consequences should one occur. "The operator of the Henerata had not assessed the risk of a capsize occurring" (3.28). A thorough risk assessment could have led to a review of operations to prevent a capsize and to the implementation of measures such as a float-free EPIRB, handholds, and emergency procedures to assist skippers and passengers in an emergency.

Stability and Buoyancy Information
Stability and buoyancy information is vital for operators to understand the capabilities and limitations of their vessels, especially in adverse conditions. The Henerata's operator lacked sufficient stability information to make informed decisions, as there was no requirement for small commercial craft to be provided with stability data. "Operators have insufficient stability information to make informed decisions, because there is no requirement for small commercial craft to be provided with stability data" (3.29). Without this information, it is challenging to define safe operating limits and to measure the margin by which a vessel may be approaching or exceeding designed buoyancy and stability criteria.

Communication Facilities and Perceived Pressure
The availability of communication facilities can influence operational decisions, particularly in remote locations. The absence of communication facilities at Freshwater Hut meant that passenger pick-up services were rarely canceled, leading to a self-perceived pressure on the skipper to operate the service despite adverse conditions. "due to the absence of any communication facilities at freshwater hut, passenger pick-up services from freshwater hut were rarely canceled" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This pressure could compromise safety by pushing skippers to proceed with operations when it might be safer to delay or cancel.

Safety Equipment Accessibility and Suitability
The accessibility and suitability of safety equipment are critical in emergency situations. In the Henerata incident, the passengers were not wearing lifejackets at the time of the capsize, and the EPIRB was not activated because the skipper could not reach it. "At the time of the capsize the passengers were not wearing their lifejackets" (3.16), and "the skipper was unable to reach and activate it when the vessel capsized" (3.17). Ensuring that safety equipment is fit for purpose, readily accessible, and that passengers are aware of and use the equipment properly can significantly affect survival outcomes.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency preparedness and response are essential for ensuring the safety of passengers and crew during unexpected events. The Henerata's capsize highlighted the need for emergency procedures and the importance of re-examining risks when conditions change. "the skipper's decision to carry on should have prompted a re-examination of the risks to which the passengers were potentially exposed" (3.13). Proper emergency response includes providing safety instructions, mustering passengers, and making safety calls, which were not adequately addressed in this incident.
Themes for 2010_007: 
Meteorological Conditions and Terrain Awareness
The challenging weather conditions and mountainous terrain around Queenstown Aerodrome are a significant safety theme, as they make aircraft operations more hazardous than at most other airports in New Zealand. The incident highlighted the importance of pilots and controllers having an accurate understanding of the meteorological conditions, especially behind Deer Park Hill, which is critical for maintaining visual contact with the terrain during circling approaches and departures. The report states that "the inability of air traffic controllers and pilots of aircraft taking off to observe the meteorological conditions behind Deer Park Hill, an area in which pilots must be able to maintain visual contact with terrain, is a safety issue that needs to be resolved" (4.2, 4.11, 4.12, 5.2).

Compliance with Approach Procedures
Compliance with PANS-OPS requirements and Civil Aviation Rules during non-precision approaches is another safety theme. The report found that pilots, especially those of jet airplanes, cannot always keep the runway in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude, which is a requirement for such approaches. This non-compliance with procedures is a safety issue, as it can lead to misunderstandings between pilots and controllers regarding the expected flight paths during circling maneuvers. "Pilots, particularly those of jet airplanes, making non-precision approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome cannot fully meet the PANS-OPS requirements for such approaches because the runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude" (4.3, 4.16, 4.17, 5.3).

Clarity and Consistency of Operational Documentation
The clarity and consistency of operational documentation, such as the AIP, airline operations manuals, and the Manual of Air Traffic Services, are crucial for ensuring that pilots and controllers have a shared understanding of procedures. The report identified inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the documentation, which contributed to the misunderstanding between the pilots and controllers about the protection of the missed approach while circling. "The controllers and the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same understanding of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific Blue was circling. The different texts in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services at that time contributed to that misunderstanding" (4.24, 4.47, 4.48, 5.12).

Separation Assurance and Communication Failures
Ensuring the minimum required separation between IFR aircraft is a safety theme that emerged from the incident. The approach clearance issued to Qantas did not account for a potential communications failure and was based on an incorrect assumption by controllers that Pacific Blue would remain in the visual circuit if it did not land. This assumption and the lack of a positive instruction for Pacific Blue to enter the visual circuit in the event of not landing led to a situation where separation was not assured. "The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes was not assured because the approach clearance issued to Qantas did not allow for a potential communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing" (4.27, 4.29, 4.30, 4.35, 5.7).

RNAV Procedure Familiarity and Waypoint Naming
The familiarity with RNAV procedures and the naming of RNAV waypoints is a safety theme related to this incident. Pilots who are not approved for or familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints, creating a communication gap that can affect safety. Additionally, the use of similar titles for different RNAV approach procedures to the same runway can lead to confusion and potentially result in an aircraft flying the wrong approach. "Pilots who are not approved for or not familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand radioed position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints. The communication gap that this potentially creates is a safety issue" (4.51, 4.52, 4.53, 5.13).

System Drift and Unintended Deviations
System drift and unintended deviations from expected standards are a safety theme that encompasses the gradual changes and less-strict adherence to procedures over time. These incremental changes can aggregate and raise the risk profile of operations, as evidenced by the acceptance of circling approaches that at times cannot comply with the rules and the lack of guidance on the acceptability of approaches when there is cloud below the minimum descent altitude. "Seemingly unrelated incremental changes and the condoning of a less-strict adherence to procedures can, over time, aggregate to produce unintended adverse effects on system safety and performance" (4.57, 4.58, 4.59, 4.60, 4.61, 4.62).
Themes for 2015_202: 
Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
The use of appropriate personal protective equipment is a critical safety theme in this accident. The bosun was not wearing a buoyancy vest when he fell into the water, which "would have significantly enhanced his chances of surviving after falling overboard" (5.1). Additionally, both the bosun and the deck trainee were wearing safety harnesses, indicating an awareness of the need for correct PPE (4.2.1). However, the bosun attempted to rig the handrails without waiting for the deck trainee to return with the buoyancy vests (4.2.3), which was a deviation from the usual safety practices and contributed to the severity of the accident.

Adequacy of Safety Equipment and Procedures
The adequacy of safety equipment and procedures is another safety theme related to this accident. The wire rope to which the bosun attached his safety harness was not fit for purpose, as it broke when he fell, leading to his fall into the sea (5.2). The wire rope was significantly weakened by corrosion, which went undetected due to the plastic coating, preventing proper inspection and maintenance (5.3). Furthermore, there was no formal procedure on board to guide the crew in proper safety precautions for rigging the accommodation ladder (5.4), indicating a lack of consistent safety procedures.

Inspection and Maintenance of Safety Equipment
Inspection and maintenance of safety equipment is a crucial safety theme in this incident. The wire rope's failure was due to severe corrosion, which was not detected because of the plastic sheathing (4.3.6). The wire was not entered into the planned maintenance system or wire rope register, and there was no record of it ever having been examined, maintained, or tested (4.3.5). This lack of inspection and maintenance of critical safety equipment directly contributed to the accident.

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management is a safety theme that is highlighted by this accident. The non-wearing of a personal flotation device by the bosun appeared to be an exceptional violation, which indicates a failure in risk assessment and management (4.2.7). A proper risk assessment for rigging an accommodation ladder would have identified the necessary strong points for attaching fall arresters, and a procedure would have prevented the use of unsafe practices (4.4.8). The absence of a risk assessment and a formal procedure for rigging the accommodation ladder increased the risk of such an accident occurring (4.4.10).

Emergency Response and Training
Emergency response and training is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The shipboard emergency response did not follow best industry practice, which could have been critical in different circumstances (5.5). The crew did not follow the man-overboard procedures incorporated in the Madinah's safety management system (4.5.1), and the most recent man-overboard drill had been held six weeks prior to the accident (4.5.4). This indicates a potential gap in the effectiveness of emergency response training and the application of procedures during an actual emergency.

Safety Culture and Compliance
Safety culture and compliance with established safety procedures is a theme that is evident in this accident. The responsibility for ensuring compliance with legislation and company operating procedures rests with the ship owner or operating company and senior staff on board (4.4.9). In this case, the managing company had not conducted a risk assessment nor developed a formal procedure for rigging the accommodation ladders, and neither had the senior on-board management or the crew performing the task (4.4.10). This indicates a breakdown in the safety culture and compliance with safety procedures, which could lead to accidents.
Themes for 2010_101: 
Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as ineffective communication was identified as a common factor across all four incidents. The report highlights multiple instances where poor communication contributed to the sequence of events leading to the accident. For example, the Otahuhu signal box controller did not provide clear information to the Auckland signal box controller about the train running order, leading to confusion and the wrong route being set for the passenger train ("The first reason for the Auckland signal box controller confusing the order of trains arriving at Tamaki was that the Otahuhu signal box controller did not give him clear information on which passenger train the shunt was following" (5.2)). Additionally, the use of non-standard phraseology by the No.2 person-in-charge of the work gang misled the train driver regarding the speed at which he could proceed, contributing to the train passing through a turnout at an unsafe speed ("The non-standard phraseology used by the No.2 person-in-charge of the work gang when calling the passenger train to the worksite area contributed to the driver's assumption that his train was clear to proceed at maximum speed from Panmure Station" (5.9)).

Crew Resource Management
Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a safety theme that emerged from the accident due to the lack of teamwork and shared situational awareness among the train crew and other rail participants. The report suggests that better CRM could have prevented the incidents, as it would have encouraged more effective communication and coordination among the crew and other parties involved. For instance, after the train was incorrectly routed, the driver made an assumption about the route ahead without consulting the train controller or the signal box controller, which led to a signal passed at danger (SPAD) ("Instead he had made an incorrect assumption about the route ahead set for his train without communicating with either the train controller or the signal box controller" (5.10)). Furthermore, the train manager did not intervene after the initial over-speed crossing, which could have been mitigated by effective CRM ("a train crew familiar with and used to operating with good crew resource management would have handled this situation better, and possibly prevented the fourth incident, the signal passed at danger" (4.6.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Adherence to Operating Procedures
Adherence to operating procedures is a safety theme that is relevant to this accident because deviations from established procedures played a significant role in the events that unfolded. The report identifies several instances where procedures were not followed, leading to unsafe conditions. For example, the Auckland signal box controller did not contact train control before taking manual control of the Tamaki signal box, which was against proper rail operating procedure and resulted in a lack of awareness about the protected worksite within the Tamaki signal box control zone ("The proper rail operating procedure was for signal box controllers to contact train control before taking manual control of signal boxes in order to obtain important information such as the correct running order of approaching trains and any worksite activities within the signal box control zones" (5.3)). Additionally, the signal box controller's relief shift duties, which deviated from normal patterns, may have contributed to a loss of situational awareness ("It is possible that this disruptive work pattern contributed to his losing awareness of the trains he was signalling and consequently the order of trains arriving at Tamaki" (5.4)).

Signal and Alert System Effectiveness
The effectiveness of signal and alert systems is a safety theme in this accident, as the installed systems did not effectively assist the train driver in maintaining situational awareness. The signal alert system in the train cab, designed to remind the driver of caution signals, was not used by the driver and was not widely used by other drivers due to its intrusive nature ("The signal alert system that had been installed in the train cab to help the driver to remember if the last signal his train had passed was a caution was not used by the driver on this occasion and was not widely used by other drivers" (5.8)). This indicates a need for revisiting the design and implementation of such systems to ensure they are effective and user-friendly in operation.

Workforce Training and Familiarity
Workforce training and familiarity with procedures and equipment is a safety theme because the report indicates that the driver and signal box controller may not have been fully aware or cognizant of the procedures and systems in place. For instance, the driver was not familiar with the wrong-line-running procedure for Tamaki and had never experienced being diverted to the Down Main line at Tamaki, which contributed to his incorrect assumptions about the signal ahead ("The driver said that he had never had his train diverted to the Down Main line at Tamaki, and he had not been informed of any wrong-line-running procedure for Tamaki at the time" (4.3.16)). Additionally, the Auckland signal box controller made errors in the train register that could indicate a lack of focus or confusion about the control desk he was operating ("These errors individually were minor, but they could have been an indication that the Auckland signal box controller was not focused entirely on the task at hand or that he was confused about which signal box control desk he was operating at the time" (4.2.17)).

Physical and Mental State of Operators
The physical and mental state of operators is a safety theme because the report discusses the potential impact of the signal box controller's shift pattern and the driver's state after the initial incident on their performance. The Auckland signal box controller's shift pattern, which was different from his normal patterns, may have affected his mental state and contributed to a loss of situational awareness ("The Auckland signal box controller's relief shift duties required him to switch between signal box desks or move to other locations 5 times within 4 hours" (5.4)). Moreover, the driver's ability to operate the train safely after the over-speed crossing to the Down Main line was questioned, suggesting that he may not have been in a fit state to continue driving ("The driver of the passenger train was unlikely to have been in a fit state to drive his train farther after experiencing the shock of his train crossing to the Down Main line through the low-speed turnout at about twice the permitted speed limit" (5.11)).
Themes for 2016_206: 
Decision to Cross the Kaipara Harbour Bar
The decision to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar was a critical safety theme in this accident. The skipper chose to cross the bar despite the forecasted weather conditions and the state of the tide, which were not suitable for a safe return. The report states, "The forecast weather conditions, in combination with the state of the tide, were not suitable for the Francie to head out over the Kaipara Harbour bar and make a safe return" (5.1). Additionally, the skipper's decision-making process was flawed, as he had a propensity to accept a high level of risk when deciding whether to cross the bar, which was known but not reported by others in the industry and community (5.3, 5.4).

Use of Lifejackets
The use and type of lifejackets were significant safety themes in this accident. It is very likely that only three of the 11 people on board were wearing lifejackets of some description when the Francie capsized, and no one was wearing a lifejacket provided on board in accordance with the Maritime Rules (5.6). The report also highlights that people have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing a lifejacket that is well fitted and of a type appropriate to the location and conditions where it will be used (5.8). Furthermore, the lifejackets on board the Francie that were approved for use under the Maritime Rules were not of a type appropriate for the nature of the Francie operation, which included crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar and operating off an exposed coastline (5.9).

Risk Perception and Acceptance
The skipper's perception and acceptance of risk were central safety themes. The report indicates that the skipper had a propensity to accept a high level of risk when deciding whether to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar (5.3). This acceptance of risk was also evident in the skipper's history of crossing the bar in adverse conditions, which was known within the industry and community but not reported (5.4). The skipper's decision to cross the bar in the forecast weather conditions is an indication that he did not understand the risk he was taking or that the risk had become normalized over time and therefore not considered to be high (4.4.4).

Reporting of Safety-Related Concerns
The lack of a formal process for reporting safety-related concerns within Maritime New Zealand was a safety theme identified in the report. Some people were using the accident and incident reporting process to raise safety concerns because there was no dedicated, formal process for submitting reports on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected breaches of maritime legislation (4.5). This theme is critical as it suggests that there were missed opportunities for intervention that could have prevented the accident (5.5).

Vessel Operating Limits and Required Lifejackets
The vessel's operating limits and the types of lifejackets required by Maritime Rules were a safety theme. The Francie was approved to operate within restricted limits, which included crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar, but the lifejackets on board were not of a type appropriate for the conditions encountered (4.7.1, 4.7.2). The Maritime Rules did not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on exposed coastlines, where higher-specification lifejackets would be more appropriate (4.7). This theme is relevant because it highlights a regulatory gap that affected the survivability of the Francie's passengers and crew (5.9).

Safety Culture and Training
The safety culture and training within the Francie's operation were underlying safety themes. The skipper's non-compliance with Maritime Rules and his low experience were factors that contributed to the accident (4.4.2). Additionally, the skipper's own written procedures around operational limits and bar crossings were exemplary on paper, but his actions did not reflect this understanding (4.4.3). The report also mentions that the skipper did not require everyone on board to wear a lifejacket when crossing the bar, which was not unusual among other skippers operating fishing charters on Kaipara Harbour (4.6.11, 4.6.12). This theme is relevant as it points to a discrepancy between written safety procedures and actual practices, as well as a broader issue of non-compliance and inadequate safety culture within the maritime community.
Themes for 2010_202: 
Inadequate Monitoring of Vessel Progress
Inadequate monitoring of vessel progress is a safety theme that refers to the failure to continuously and accurately track the position and movement of a vessel against a planned route or passage plan. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate did not adequately monitor the ship's progress against the passage plan and the master's night orders. The report states, "The Anatoki ran aground because the mate was not adequately monitoring the progress of the ship against the passage plan and the master's night orders" (5.1). Additionally, the mate's failure to monitor the vessel's progress is further emphasized by the fact that "in the period immediately before the grounding, [the mate] could not have been monitoring the progress of the vessel at all" (5.1).

Lack of Bridge Watch Navigational and Alarm Systems
The lack of bridge watch navigational and alarm systems is a safety theme that involves the absence of equipment or systems designed to assist a watchkeeper in maintaining awareness of the vessel's position and to alert them to potential dangers. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the vessel did not have a working bridge watch navigational and alarm system that could have mitigated the risk of one-man bridge operations. The report indicates that "A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations" (5.2). The absence of such a system meant that the mate might not have been alerted in time to prevent the grounding (5.2).

Self-Imposed Sleep Deprivation
Self-imposed sleep deprivation refers to situations where individuals do not take advantage of available opportunities to rest, leading to fatigue and impaired performance. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate did not take enough of the ample opportunity he had to rest before being required for watchkeeping duties (5.3). The report also suggests that "The mate's performance was likely to have been adversely affected by his only having a maximum of 3.5 hours sleep in the preceding 21 hours" (5.4). The combination of limited sleep and the possible effects of alcohol consumption on the quality of sleep could have contributed to the mate's impaired performance (4.3.10).

Alcohol Consumption and Policy Non-Compliance
Alcohol consumption and policy non-compliance is a safety theme that involves the use of alcohol by crew members in violation of company policies, potentially impairing their ability to perform duties safely. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate consumed "4 to 5 pints of beer" before going on duty, and the master's tacit acceptance of this behavior indicated that the company's drug and alcohol policy was not being complied with (4.4.4). The report also finds that "The company drug and alcohol policy was not at the time of this accident complied with by the Anatoki's master and crew" (5.7).

Ambiguity in Navigation Orders
Ambiguity in navigation orders refers to unclear or impractical instructions given to the crew for navigating a vessel, which can lead to confusion and errors. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate deviated from the passage plan in accordance with the master's ambiguous night orders, which instructed to "stay 5 miles off the coast" if arriving early (4.2.2). The ambiguity of these instructions and their impracticality given the vessel's planned proximity to the coast contributed to the confusion and the eventual grounding of the vessel (4.2.2).

Inadequate Post-Incident Testing for Alcohol and Drugs
Inadequate post-incident testing for alcohol and drugs is a safety theme that involves the failure to promptly and effectively screen crew members for substance use following an accident, which can hinder the investigation into the causes of the incident. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the post-incident testing for alcohol and drugs was not carried out until more than 10.5 hours after the grounding, by which time it was unlikely that any alcohol would have remained in the crew's bodies (4.3.6). The report highlights that "For post-incident screening for alcohol and drugs in a person's body to be effective the screening should be carried out as soon as possible after the incident" (4.3.6).
Themes for 2011_001: 
Engine Performance Monitoring
Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme that involves the regular assessment and tracking of engine parameters to ensure the engine is functioning correctly. In this accident, the pilot reported "a sudden, large decrease in engine power" (4.1.1) and was unable to recall critical engine parameters such as the N1, which would have indicated the power the engine was developing (4.1.1). The lack of detailed engine performance data hindered the diagnosis of the problem, emphasizing the importance of effective engine monitoring for safety.

Pilot Training and Emergency Response
Pilot training and emergency response preparedness are essential for handling unexpected situations such as power loss. In this incident, the pilot "took the appropriate immediate action of putting the helicopter into an autorotative descent" (4.2.2) and managed to execute a well-executed ditching despite the firm landing (4.2.4). However, the pilot's inability to recall other engine indications (4.2.3) and the absence of a recollection of yaw (4.2.5) suggest that training on situational awareness and emergency procedures is relevant to this accident.

Maintenance and Inspection Procedures
Maintenance and inspection procedures are crucial to ensure that aircraft components function correctly and reliably. The investigation found that "no significant defect was found during the inspections of the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor" (4.2.10), but there were discrepancies in maintenance records (4.2.14). These findings highlight the importance of thorough and accurate maintenance and inspection practices as a safety theme related to this accident.

Fuel Management
Fuel management encompasses the proper handling, quality control, and monitoring of fuel to prevent issues such as fuel starvation or contamination. In this case, the pilot ensured that the fuel tank was topped up (4.2.12), and tests confirmed the fuel quality was acceptable (4.2.12). Despite the engine power loss, "fuel continued to reach the engine" (4.2.13), indicating that fuel management was not the cause of the accident but remains a critical safety theme.

Survival Equipment and Procedures
Survival equipment and procedures are vital for increasing the chances of survival in the event of an accident, especially over water. The pilot operated without a life jacket on board, "contrary to Civil Aviation Rules" (5.3), and his rescue was "due to the fortuitous presence of witnesses on shore" (5.4). This accident underscores the importance of having appropriate survival gear and following procedures to enhance post-accident survivability.

Flight Planning and Monitoring
Flight planning and monitoring involve the preparation and tracking of a flight to ensure its safety and to facilitate search and rescue operations if necessary. The pilot did not arrange flight-following (4.3.2), and there was no certainty that anyone would have reported him missing if the accident had not been witnessed (4.3.2). This accident illustrates the safety theme of the need for proper flight planning and monitoring to ensure timely rescue in the event of an emergency.
Themes for 2012_001: 
Pilot Impairment Due to Substance Use
Pilot impairment due to substance use is a critical safety theme in this accident. The pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre, which was likely the result of recent use of cannabis shortly before the flight and longer-term use that redistributed into his blood after death ("the pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre. This was likely the result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the flight (considered highly likely), and residual THC from his having ingested cannabis over a longer term that redistributed into his blood after he died" (5.9)). The possibility that the pilot's performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded, and the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot ("The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot. The possibility that the pilot's performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded" (5.10)).

Inadequate Regulatory Oversight
Inadequate regulatory oversight is another significant safety theme. The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public ("The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public" (5.12)). This theme is relevant because the oversight did not effectively address the safety risks associated with commercial ballooning, which could have contributed to the accident.

Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules, which showed a disregard for complying with the rules ("The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules. This was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way, but it did show a disregard for complying with the rules" (5.8)). Although it did not directly contribute to the accident, this non-compliance indicates a broader issue of adherence to safety regulations.

Lack of Private Balloon Licence Requirements
The lack of private balloon licence requirements is a safety theme because there is no requirement for private ballooning in New Zealand to hold a licence, which is at variance with International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines and those of other countries with similarly developed histories of ballooning ("It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge or medical certificate can take non-paying passengers for a balloon flight" (5.13)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the potential risks associated with unregulated private ballooning activities.

Pilot's Decision-making and Judgement
The pilot's decision-making and judgement is a central safety theme in this accident. The pilot made several errors in judgement, such as allowing the balloon to descend below the level of power lines and attempting to out-climb the power lines instead of initiating an emergency descent ("The pilot allowed the balloon to descend below the level of power lines surrounding a paddock in which he did not intend to land" (5.2), "the pilot exercised poor judgement by attempting to out-climb the power lines, and the balloon collided with them" (5.4)). These errors were critical in the sequence of events that led to the accident.

Emergency Procedures and Equipment Knowledge
Emergency procedures and equipment knowledge is a safety theme because the passengers were not briefed on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines, which could have been crucial in the event of the pilot's incapacitation ("a balloon pilot would not normally brief passengers on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines" (4.5.7)). This theme is relevant as it pertains to the preparedness of passengers to respond to emergency situations, which could potentially mitigate the severity of an accident.
Themes for 2016_006: 
Wind Assessment and Approach Planning
Wind assessment and approach planning is a critical safety theme in helicopter operations, especially in mountainous terrain. In this accident, the pilot made the final approach to the south, expecting a westerly crosswind, but the wind was actually from the north, resulting in a downwind approach. This misjudgment of wind direction and strength is a common challenge in mountain flying and can lead to reduced performance and control issues. The report states, "the pilot made the final approach to the south, expecting a westerly crosswind...the wind was from the north. therefore it was very likely that the landing approach was made downwind" (4.3.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The relevance of this theme is further emphasized by the fact that "It is usually preferable to land a helicopter into wind" (4.3.2), and the pilot's failure to confirm the anticipated wind direction led to a tight turn to a short final approach, which did not allow him time to confirm the anticipated wind (5.3).

Helicopter Performance and Handling
Helicopter performance and handling is a safety theme that encompasses the aircraft's ability to respond to pilot inputs and environmental conditions. In this accident, the helicopter's performance was not a contributing factor, as it had sufficient power to approach, hover, and land at the altitude of the landing site (4.5.2). However, the pilot's handling of the aircraft during the approach and go-around was critical. The pilot's misjudgment of the wind led to a loss of translational lift without a compensatory increase in power, resulting in the helicopter sinking and striking the ground (4.3.8). The report also notes that "The helicopter responded correctly to flight control inputs and to the demanded power increase" (4.5.7), indicating that the handling of the helicopter during the go-around was a significant aspect of the accident.

Pilot Decision Making and Training
Pilot decision making and training is a safety theme that involves the choices made by pilots based on their training, experience, and situational awareness. In this case, the pilot's decision to not fly a reconnaissance pattern prior to the approach, due to familiarity with the landing site, and the subsequent misjudgment of the wind direction were key factors in the accident (4.3.6, 4.6.1). The report highlights the importance of careful flight planning and vigilance when approaching unprepared landing sites in mountainous terrain (4.6.1). Additionally, the operator arranged additional human factors training for pilots following the accident, covering topics such as decision-making and situational awareness (4.6.2), indicating the relevance of this theme to the accident.

Emergency Response and Equipment
Emergency response and equipment is a safety theme that includes the effectiveness of emergency procedures and the reliability of emergency equipment. In this accident, the helicopter's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) failed to alert the search and rescue network promptly due to antenna disconnection during the crash (4.8.5). This had the potential to delay search and rescue operations, adversely affecting survivability (5.8). The report also notes the importance of pilots advising their flight-following services of any changes to their flight plans to ensure an effective emergency response (4.8.9).

Organizational Safety Management
Organizational safety management is a safety theme that involves the policies, procedures, and culture of an aviation operator that contribute to overall safety. The operator in this accident had experienced four serious landing accidents in three years, prompting a recommendation for a review of the operator's safety management system (4.7.8). The report also mentions that the operator had made changes to organizational systems and policy as a result of previous accidents (4.7.3). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the finding that "the operator had had four significant landing accidents in three years, for which the factors were not determined conclusively" (5.7).

Approach and Landing Techniques
Approach and landing techniques are a safety theme that includes the methods and procedures used by pilots during the critical phases of flight leading up to landing. In this accident, the pilot's approach was at a relatively high speed, low, and close to the landing site, which did not allow time to confirm the wind direction and resulted in a tight turn to a short final approach (5.3). The report states that "a longer, descending final approach, offset from rather than perpendicular to the ridgeline, would have been preferable" (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the pilot did not conform with the operator's stated principle of conducting constant attitude approaches (5.6), and the approach technique used negated the intended escape route, preventing a successful go-around (5.5).
Themes for 2019_203: 
Overloading of Securing Equipment
Overloading of securing equipment is a safety theme that emerged from the accident, where the foot wire was subjected to a load exceeding its breaking strength. The metallurgical examination concluded that "the failure of the rope most likely occurred as a result of overload" (3.7). Additionally, the destructive test showed that the load required to part the wire was 26.21 tonnes, and the foot wire was not significantly weakened since its manufacture, indicating that the crane was applying a load that resulted in the foot wire being overloaded and parting (3.9, 3.10, 3.11). This theme is relevant because it directly contributed to the equipment failure that led to the accident.

Lack of Awareness of Load Limits
The crew's lack of awareness of the load limits and the actual loads being applied during the securing operation is a safety theme in this accident. The cargo securing manual did not record the maximum securing load of the foot wire, and the crew were unaware of the value when interviewed, increasing the risk of inadvertently exceeding the breaking load (3.12). Furthermore, the crew did not realize that the foot wire was experiencing a load three to four times greater than the load being applied by the crane (3.14). This lack of awareness is relevant because it prevented the crew from recognizing the risk of overloading and taking appropriate precautions.

Inadequate Use of Equipment
The inadequate use of equipment, specifically the absence of turnbuckles, is another safety theme. The accident occurred in part because turnbuckles, which allow tension to be increased or decreased manually, were not rigged between the wiggle wire and the foot wires (3.15). Instead, the crane was used to apply tension, which increased the risk of overloading the foot wire. The crew's reliance on the crane for tensioning, without a means to measure the tension, exposed them to the risk of equipment failure (3.16). This theme is relevant as the proper use of turnbuckles could have prevented the need for excessive tension applied by the crane and reduced the likelihood of overloading.

Ineffective Safety Management Systems
The operator's ineffective safety management system (SMS) is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. The SMS did not support an effective safety assessment of log-cargo-securing operations, which should have identified the hazards present (3.18). The audits did not identify the use of an out-of-date IMO Code of Safe Practice, resulting in missed amendments that would have made the operation safer (3.25). The lack of a fulsome risk assessment meant there was no guidance on the dangers associated with wires under tension or safe areas to stand when a crane was being used (3.29). This theme is relevant because an effective SMS would have provided the necessary guidance and controls to mitigate the risks to the crew.

Insufficient Pre-Work Safety Meetings
The absence of routine pre-work safety meetings, or 'toolbox talks', is a safety theme that reflects a missed opportunity for the crew to discuss safety implications and consider alternative solutions to standing in hazardous places (3.17). Such meetings could have prompted the use of recommended turnbuckles to reduce the amount of tension required in the wiggle wire, potentially avoiding the accident. This theme is relevant as it highlights a lack of procedural safeguards that could have enhanced crew awareness and safety during hazardous operations.

Inadequate Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Inadequate risk assessment and mitigation is a safety theme where the crew's risk assessments did not identify significant hazards such as the potential for wires under tension to part (3.28). The SMS did not provide a safe operating procedure for the crew to follow, and the operator had not undertaken a fulsome risk assessment for log-securing operations (3.29). This theme is relevant because a comprehensive risk assessment would have likely identified the hazards and allowed for the implementation of effective mitigation measures, reducing the risks to the crew.
Themes for 2011_103: 
Communication Plan and Procedures
The communication plan and procedures are a critical safety theme in this incident. The initial communication plan agreed upon by the track ganger and the person in charge complied with KiwiRail procedures and likely would have prevented the incident ("A communication plan was considered by and agreed between the track ganger and the person in charge of the worksite. That initial plan complied with KiwiRail procedures and most probably would have prevented the incident" (5.7)). However, the amended communication plan increased the risk because the protection person could not see the work gang and it added an additional step using another means of communication ("The amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance operation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less likely to have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the work gang; and it added an additional step using another means of communication" (5.8)). The protection person's failure to follow the amended communication plan was the final act that contributed to the incident ("The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed" (5.10)).

Planning and Coordination of Track Maintenance
Planning and coordination of track maintenance work is another safety theme that played a role in this incident. The timing of the maintenance work was planned around the availability of the person in charge rather than optimizing efficiency with the least disruption to rail services ("The timing of the maintenance work was planned around the availability of the person in charge rather than optimising efficiency with the least disruption to rail services" (5.3)). Additionally, KiwiRail's system for planning track maintenance did not promote the coordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation, which could have reduced the risk of conflicts between maintenance gangs and rail vehicles ("KiwiRail's system for planning track maintenance did not promote the co-ordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation" (5.5)).

Training and Certification of Maintenance Staff
The training and certification of maintenance staff is a critical safety theme because KiwiRail's safety system could not ensure that infrastructure staff were competent to perform their roles. The track ganger and protection person had completed their Level C track protection theory training, but it could not be determined from KiwiRail's training records whether they had been assessed for and demonstrated competency in their respective roles ("Both the track ganger and the protection person had completed their Level C track protection theory training but it could not be determined from KiwiRail's training records whether they had been assessed for and demonstrated competency in their respective roles" (5.11)). This suggests that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day of the incident ("The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day" (5.13)).

Use of Performance-Impairing Substances
The use of performance-impairing substances is a significant safety theme because the protection person had been a regular user of cannabis, which is contrary to KiwiRail's drug and alcohol policy. Although it could not be determined if the protection person was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident, the use of cannabis by staff performing safety-critical tasks is of concern ("the protection person had been a regular user of cannabis, and subsequent testing confirmed that he had probably continued to use cannabis during the month following the incident" (6.1)). This issue is highlighted by the fact that the protection person did not follow the communication plan, which was a critical failure leading to the near miss ("The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed" (5.10)).

Distraction from Personal Electronic Devices
Distraction from personal electronic devices, specifically mobile phones, is a safety theme that emerged from this incident. The protection person was exchanging text messages with his partner around the time he was supposed to be protecting the safety of the work gang on the tracks, which could have distracted him from his duties ("The protection person cited personal circumstances that were distracting him at the time he was supposed to be protecting the safety of the work gang on the tracks. His mobile phone records do show that he was exchanging text messages with his partner around that time" (4.5.7)). Mobile phone use has been recognized as a major distractor in other accidents investigated by the Commission, and this behavior was evident in the protection person's actions during the incident ("Mobile phone use has proven to be a major distractor in other rail, air and marine accidents that the Commission has investigated" (4.5.9)).

Adherence to Safety Procedures and Rules
Adherence to safety procedures and rules is a safety theme that was not properly followed in this incident. The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence, leading to unclear roles and methods of operation ("The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence" (5.6)). Furthermore, the track ganger's decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority are indicative of a lack of adherence to established safety procedures and rules ("The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day" (5.13)).
Themes for 2019_001: 
Aerodynamic Stability of External Loads
The aerodynamic stability of external loads, such as monsoon buckets, is a critical safety theme in this accident. The investigation found that the monsoon bucket became aerodynamically unstable during flight, which likely resulted in the bucket moving into close proximity to the helicopter and the lifting line striking the tail rotor. This instability was attributed to the hook-and-loop fastener system of the bucket potentially coming undone during operations, which was identified as a safety issue ("the initial design of the cloudburst monsoon bucket meant the hook-and-loop fastener system had the potential to come undone during operations" (3.12)). The instability of the bucket was further evidenced by previous occurrences where similar buckets became unstable in flight (3.13-3.16).

Equipment Design and Modification
The design and subsequent modification of equipment used in external load operations is another safety theme related to this accident. The monsoon bucket's initial design included a hook-and-loop fastener system that had the potential to come undone, posing a risk during operations. Although the manufacturer developed design improvements to reduce this likelihood, these modifications were not mandatory ("The bucket manufacturer had developed design improvements to reduce the likelihood of the hook-and-loop fastener tabs coming undone, but these modifications were not mandatory" (4.5)). The investigation highlighted the importance of ensuring that equipment design evolves to enhance safety and that modifications addressing known issues are implemented.

Dissemination of Operational Information and Limitations
The dissemination of operational information and limitations by equipment manufacturers is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. The manufacturer of the monsoon bucket had developed operational information and limitations for its use but did not proactively share this information with operators ("The bucket manufacturer had developed operational information and limitations for the use of its monsoon buckets, but did not proactively promulgate this information to operators" (4.6)). This lack of communication meant that operators may not have been aware of the best practices or limitations associated with the equipment, potentially increasing the risk of accidents.

Lifting Line Length for External Load Operations
The appropriate length of lifting lines for external load operations is a safety theme that is directly relevant to this accident. The investigation found that the monsoon bucket lifting line was of a length that likely increased the risk of the external load coming into contact with the tail rotor ("The monsoon bucket lifting line was of a length that likely increased the risk of the external load coming into contact with the tail rotor" (4.7)). Additionally, there was insufficient guidance available to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations, which is a safety issue that could affect future operations ("There was insufficient guidance available to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations" (4.8)).

Reporting and Learning from Previous Occurrences
Reporting and learning from previous occurrences is a safety theme that was highlighted by the investigation. The operator had experienced a previous incident with the same bucket but had not reported it through their internal quality and safety management system, missing an opportunity to promote awareness or improve operational procedures ("The operator had not reported their earlier incident with this same bucket (see 3.14) through their internal quality and safety management system" (3.46)). This theme underscores the importance of capturing and sharing safety-related information within and across organizations to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents.

Regulatory Framework and Guidance for External Load Operations
The regulatory framework and guidance for external load operations constitute a safety theme in this accident. The investigation indicated that while Civil Aviation Rules are in place to minimize risks associated with helicopter external load operations, there was no requirement for a manufacturer to promulgate any operational information or limitations, and the existing guidance was insufficient ("As the aviation regulatory framework did not cover this type of external load equipment, there was no requirement for a manufacturer to promulgate any operational information or limitations" (3.32)). This theme suggests the need for more comprehensive regulations and guidance to ensure the safe conduct of external load operations.
Themes for 2011_203: 
Maintenance Practices
Maintenance practices are a critical safety theme in this accident, as the maintenance regime followed by Fullers did not correspond to the engine manufacturer's recommended maintenance program. The document states, "the maintenance regime that Fullers followed did not correspond to Wärtsilä's (the engine manufacturer's) recommended maintenance programme" (4.1.5). Furthermore, Fullers extended the 16,000-hour replacement program to 24,000 hours based on its engine lubricating oil monitoring program, which deviated from the manufacturer's guidelines (4.3.2). This theme is relevant because improper maintenance can lead to mechanical failures, as evidenced by the catastrophic engine failure in this case.

Engine Monitoring and Performance Analysis
Engine monitoring and performance analysis is another safety theme related to this accident. The engine room was normally unmanned, with most engine monitoring done remotely, which could affect the timeliness and effectiveness of detecting issues (4.1.2). Additionally, the lubricating oil analysis program did not detect that the Jet Raider's starboard engine condition was deteriorating compared to the port engine, although the oil was still within "normal" parameters (4.3.4, 4.3.7, 4.3.9). This theme is relevant because effective monitoring can provide early warning signs of potential failures, allowing for preventative measures to be taken before a catastrophic event occurs.

Emergency Response Preparedness
Emergency response preparedness is a crucial safety theme, as the document highlights issues with the emergency response, particularly the procedure for releasing the engine room fixed CO2 fire-suppression system (4.4.2). Only half of the required CO2 fire-suppression system was released into the engine room due to a misunderstanding of the vessel's configuration, which could have been insufficient to extinguish a sustained fire (4.4.4, 4.4.6). This theme is relevant because a well-prepared and correctly executed emergency response is vital for the safety of passengers and crew in the event of an accident.

Training and Drills
Training and drills are a significant safety theme as the document indicates that the system of transferring passengers to another vessel as a means of evacuation was not documented or practiced during evacuation drills (4.1.5). Additionally, crews did not practice transferring passengers from one vessel to another or bringing one vessel alongside another, despite this being a likely scenario in the congested Hauraki Gulf (4.4.11). This theme is relevant because regular training and drills ensure that crew members are prepared to handle emergencies effectively and can significantly impact the outcome of an incident.

Engine Design and Operation
Engine design and operation are pertinent to this accident, as the failure sequence analysis suggests that the engine's design, which linked the flow of cooling water and lubricating oil to engine revolutions, could contribute to localized overheating under certain operating conditions (4.2.16). The document also mentions a previous incident involving the same engine type, where local overheating was determined to be the cause of failure (4.2.17, 4.2.19). This theme is relevant because the design and operational characteristics of an engine can influence its reliability and the likelihood of failure, which in turn affects the safety of the vessel's operations.

Manufacturer's Support and Communication
Manufacturer's support and communication is a safety theme that emerges from the document, as Fullers had previously asked Wärtsilä for the rationale behind its recommended maintenance program, but Wärtsilä had not responded (4.3.4). The lack of clear communication from the manufacturer regarding maintenance schedules and the rationale behind them can lead to uncertainty and potentially inadequate maintenance practices. This theme is relevant because effective communication between manufacturers and operators is essential for understanding and implementing proper maintenance and operational procedures to ensure safety.
Themes for 2015_003: 
Fatigue and Cycle Calculations during Certification
Fatigue and cycle calculations during certification is a safety theme that relates to the process of determining the expected service life of critical aircraft components based on the stresses and cycles they are expected to endure. This theme is relevant to the accident because the helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying, which involves increased loads and cycles that were not considered when calculating the service life of the rotor blades. The document states, "the helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying. the manufacturer had therefore not been required to consider the increased loads and cycles of agricultural flying when calculating the service life of the rotor blades" (4.5.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Additionally, "Robinson's fatigue-life calculations and safe-life limits for components used in standard flight operations were unlikely to be valid for helicopters routinely used for agricultural operations" (4.4.5).

Major Aircraft Modifications and Role Changes
Major aircraft modifications and role changes is a safety theme that involves assessing the impact of significant alterations to an aircraft's design on its operational use and the service life of its components. This theme is pertinent to the accident because the installation of spray equipment was a major modification that changed the usage of the helicopter, subjecting it to flight stresses not envisaged by the manufacturer. The document highlights, "The fitting of a spray system to the R44 was a major modification that changed the usage of the helicopter and subjected it to flight stresses that had not been envisaged by the helicopter manufacturer" (4.1.4). Furthermore, "the design organisation's stress analysis during the spray system's design and testing did not take into account, and was not required to take into account, the increased loads and cycles imposed on the dynamic components of a helicopter used for agricultural flying" (4.6.8).

Operational Factors Considered
Operational factors considered is a safety theme that encompasses the operational practices and conditions under which an aircraft is flown, including power settings, load management, and maneuvering techniques. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter had been flown mostly on spraying operations at high power settings, likely exceeding the allowable take-off limit at times, and the types of turns used during spraying subjected the main rotor blades to stresses above their design, contributing to the onset of fatigue. Evidence for this includes, "the helicopter had been flown mostly on spraying operations at high power settings, which were likely to have exceeded the allowable take-off limit at times" (4.3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) and "the types of turn used during spraying, particularly when the helicopter was at heavy weights, likely subjected the main rotor blades to stresses above those for which the blades were designed and contributed to the onset of fatigue at the chord transition radius" (4.4.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).

Component Fatigue and Material Limitations
Component fatigue and material limitations is a safety theme that deals with the susceptibility of aircraft components to accumulated fatigue and the inherent limitations of the materials used in their construction. This theme is relevant to the accident as the main rotor blade failure was attributed to metal fatigue, and the NTSB examination concluded that the cracks contained features consistent with fatigue failure. The document states, "The point of origin of the crack in the main rotor blade trailing edge had features consistent with metal fatigue" (5.2) and "The NTSB examination report concluded that there were no manufacturing defects in the materials or in the construction of the blade, with all components of the blade meeting the design specifications" (4.2.3).

Manufacturer's Design and Testing Procedures
Manufacturer's design and testing procedures is a safety theme that involves the processes and methodologies used by aircraft manufacturers to design, test, and certify aircraft components. This theme is relevant to the accident because the manufacturer, Robinson, had not anticipated the in-service stresses at the chord transition to be as high as they were during agricultural operations. The document notes, "The fracture of the blade at the chord transition indicated that in-service stresses at the chord transition were higher than Robinson had anticipated" (4.5.2) and "Robinson advised that under design operating conditions the shift would not have been an issue, because even allowing for the additional stress of intensive agricultural operations, Robinson had calculated that there was still an adequate margin above the 2,200 hours' stated service life" (4.5.2).

Regulatory Oversight and Certification Processes
Regulatory oversight and certification processes is a safety theme that refers to the role of aviation authorities in the approval and oversight of aircraft design changes and modifications. This theme is relevant to the accident because the regulatory framework did not require a stress analysis or fatigue assessment of the aircraft with the modification installed, which would have helped determine the impact of the spray equipment on the fatigue life of the helicopter's components. The document indicates, "There was no requirement under CAR Part 146 for a stress analysis or fatigue assessment of the aircraft with the modification installed" (4.6.3) and "National aviation authorities, like the CAA, that issue type certificates or type acceptance certificates appear to be best placed to obtain the co-operation of aircraft manufacturers in assessing the effects of a proposed modification on continuing airworthiness" (4.6.8).
Themes for 2017_201: 
Voyage Planning and Navigation Conduct
Voyage planning and navigation conduct is a critical safety theme as it involves the preparation and execution of a ship's route to ensure safe passage. In the case of L'Austral, the voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management did not meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards or the guidelines published in other leading industry publications ("Voyage planning and conduct of navigation" section). This inadequacy in planning and execution led to the vessel inadvertently entering a 300-metre exclusion zone and making contact with an uncharted rock ("Findings" section 5.1, 5.2). The master and navigation officer failed to maintain situational awareness and did not have an agreed plan or effective communication, which are essential components of bridge resource management ("Bridge resource management" section 4.3.1-4.3.8).


ECDIS Operation and Chart Accuracy
The operation of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) and the accuracy of the charts used are vital for safe navigation. In this incident, L'Austral's ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator's safety management system ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)" section). The ECDIS was loaded with an unofficial ENC, which had a lower Category Zone of Confidence (CATZOC) than the paper chart, indicating a lower level of confidence in the data ("Chart accuracy" section 4.4.1-4.4.5). Additionally, the bridge team was not fully familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the ECDIS and did not make the best use of it, which contributed to the vessel entering an unauthorized zone ("Findings" section 5.7, 5.8).


Bridge Resource Management
Bridge resource management involves the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, procedures, and equipment, to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel. In the case of L'Austral, the standard of bridge resource management did not meet good industry practice. There was a lack of effective leadership, communication, and a shared understanding of the navigation plan on the bridge, which are key aspects of bridge resource management ("Bridge resource management" section 4.3.1). The master's focus on recovering the RHIBs and the navigation officer's uncertainty about the master's intentions due to a lack of briefing led to a situation where the vessel's position was not adequately monitored, resulting in the grounding ("Findings" section 5.6).


Crew Training and Familiarity with Navigation Systems
Proper crew training and familiarity with navigation systems are essential for the safe operation of a vessel. The navigation officer on L'Austral had received type-specific training for the ECDIS in-house, which may not have been adequate, and did not comply with the IMO standard. Furthermore, after spending 20 months ashore, there was a strong case for refresher training to ensure full familiarity with the ECDIS, which did not occur ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)" section 4.4.8-4.4.9). This lack of training and familiarity likely contributed to the ineffective use of the ECDIS and the subsequent accident.


Risk Assessment and Maritime Expertise
Conducting formal risk assessments using appropriate maritime expertise is crucial for ensuring the safety of navigation and protecting the environment. The Department of Conservation granted a coastal permit allowing L'Austral to navigate up to 300 metres from the shoreline without conducting a formal risk assessment and without sufficient maritime expertise to assess the risks to ships and the environment ("Department of Conservation permits" section 4.5.4, "Findings" section 5.9). This oversight allowed the vessel to operate in a potentially hazardous area without the necessary risk controls in place, leading to the grounding.


Compliance with Maritime Regulations and Permits
Adherence to maritime regulations and permits is a fundamental aspect of maritime safety. L'Austral was not permitted to operate within 300 metres of the shoreline under the conditions of its coastal permit, yet it made contact with an uncharted rock closer than 300 metres to the shore ("What happened" section 4.2.5). This breach of the coastal permit and the ship entering an area where the master had decided not to take it are indicative of a safety issue with the standard of planning and bridge resource management ("What happened" section 4.2.8).
Themes for 2013_002: 
Maintenance Procedures and Oversight
Maintenance procedures and oversight are critical for ensuring the airworthiness of aircraft components. In this accident, a simple maintenance error was identified as the most likely cause of the engine power loss. Specifically, "an oil slinger was omitted during a maintenance procedure" (5.1), which led to engine oil accumulating in the magneto. This oversight in maintenance procedures compromised the magneto's function, directly contributing to the incident. Additionally, the engine and its accessories had not been subjected to the inspections and maintenance required for continued airworthiness before being released to service (5.2), highlighting the importance of thorough maintenance and adherence to established procedures.

Inspection of Used Parts
The inspection of used parts, especially those of unknown origin, is a safety theme that is relevant to this accident. The engine involved in the incident was second-hand and lacked proper documentation to reflect its airworthiness status (4.3.1). The guidelines for inspecting such parts were not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were inadequate (5.3). This resulted in the engine being released to service without the necessary inspections and maintenance, which could have identified the omission of the oil slinger and prevented the power loss.

Compliance with Mandatory Service Bulletins
Compliance with mandatory service bulletins is a safety theme that ensures aircraft components are maintained according to the latest safety standards and manufacturer recommendations. In this case, the engine's logbook did not record the manufacturer's mandatory service bulletins as having been carried out, nor were they completed by Aeromotive before the engine was released to service (4.3.9). This lack of compliance with mandatory service bulletins could have led to undetected issues with the engine components, such as the magnetos, which were found to have cracked distributor blocks after the incident (4.2.4).

Engine Accessory Inspection and Testing
The inspection and testing of engine accessories are crucial for identifying potential issues that could lead to engine failure. The engine and its accessories were not functionally checked during the conformity inspection, or prior to the issue of the Form One (4.3.7). This oversight meant that the malfunctioning right magneto, which was likely the cause of the engine power loss, was not identified and rectified before the engine was put into service.

Training and Guidance for Conformity Inspections
Training and guidance for carrying out conformity inspections of aircraft parts are essential for ensuring that maintenance personnel are adequately equipped to assess the airworthiness of components. The CAA had not released training material specifically for engineers who carried out this type of conformity inspection, and it was left up to the Part 145 companies to train their staff in the procedures involved (4.3.14). The procedures used during the conformity inspection in this case did not ensure that the engine was acceptable for installation, suggesting a need for improved guidance and training (4.3.14).

Life Jacket Usage in Over-Water Operations
The use of life jackets in over-water operations is a safety theme that can significantly reduce the risk to occupants in the event of a ditching. Although the operator had complied with the regulatory requirement for the carriage of life jackets, the occupants were not required to wear them under normal circumstances (4.4.1). The incident highlights the importance of not only carrying but also wearing quick-donning life jackets, especially in single-engine helicopter operations where a ditching could occur with little notice (4.4.4).
Themes for 2010_011: 
Data and Research Limitations
The theme of data and research limitations is highly relevant to this accident because the Commission found a significant lack of recent research examining the factors contributing to occurrences specifically in the context of flying training, both in New Zealand and overseas. This scarcity of information makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the state of flying training safety and to identify appropriate safety strategies. "There was virtually no recent research in New Zealand or overseas that examined the factors contributing to occurrences specifically in the context of flying training" (6.2). Additionally, the CAA's occurrence database has limitations that prevent accurate and meaningful analysis of flying training accident causal factors and historical safety trends, which further exacerbates the issue. "limitations in the caa's existing safety occurrence reporting and monitoring system... prevented an accurate and meaningful analysis of flying training accident causal factors and historical safety trends" (6.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).

CAA's Safety Reviews and Reporting
The theme of the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) safety reviews and reporting is pertinent to this accident because the CAA has not widely or periodically published comprehensive safety reviews that emphasize accident and incident trends, analyses of precursors, contributing factors, and lessons learned. This lack of systematic safety reporting hinders the enhancement of stakeholders' safety focus and the ability to identify systemic safety issues, trends, and risks within the flying training sector. "compared with other countries, the caa has not widely or periodically published any comprehensive safety reviews of aviation in new zealand... that have a major emphasis on accident and incident trends, and analyses of precursors, contributing factors and lessons learned" (6.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).

Quality of Flight Training
The quality of flight training is a significant safety theme because the Commission was unable to conclude whether the standard of flight training in New Zealand presents risks to flight training safety. Without specific research examining the quality of the flight training system, it is challenging to determine if there are significant gaps that could contribute to safety risks. "The Commission was unable to conclude whether the standard of flight training in New Zealand presents risks to flight training safety" (7.4). Furthermore, there is a noted data gap regarding flight instructor demographics, performance, and competency levels, which should be addressed to ensure the quality of training. "General information about flight instructor demographics (e.g., qualifications, experience levels, age), performance and competency levels is difficult to obtain" (7.5).

Effects of Increasing Air Traffic
The effects of increasing air traffic on flying training and aviation safety are uncertain due to insufficient data and research on the matter. While international research suggests that increasing traffic could be a contributing factor to flying training occurrences, it is not a dominant cause. However, the risk is likely to be elevated with increased traffic. "The effects of increasing aviation activity in New Zealand on flying training and aviation safety in general are uncertain" (7.6). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for more data to understand how growing aviation activity impacts safety and to develop strategies to mitigate potential risks.

English Language Proficiency
English language proficiency is a relevant safety theme because poor English language skills have been identified as contributing factors in significant international accidents and some New Zealand occurrences. Although New Zealand has a framework for testing English language proficiency in civil aviation, anecdotal evidence suggests that language issues may still contribute to occurrences. "Anecdotal evidence suggests that poor English language proficiency and comprehension of English may have been contributing factors in some New Zealand occurrences" (7.9). Ensuring that pilots have adequate English language skills is crucial for maintaining safety in aviation operations.
Themes for 2017_102: 
Communication and Coordination
Effective communication and coordination between signallers and other personnel are crucial for safe railway operations. In this incident, there was a breakdown in communication and coordination, as evidenced by the fact that "Signaller A gave verbal authority to the RCO on the shunt locomotive to pass the red signal and proceed to the next red signal near the track fault" (3.2.11), based on the incorrect belief that the route was set correctly. Additionally, the maintainer confirmed with Signaller A that the points were in the correct position for the shunt locomotive to proceed (3.2.9), but this was not the case. The miscommunication and lack of proper coordination led to the shunt locomotive being incorrectly routed, which could have resulted in a collision.

Signal and Point Operation
The proper operation of signals and points is essential for directing trains safely along the correct routes. In this accident, the signal and point operation were compromised due to a track fault and a misunderstanding of the track layout. Signaller B, under the direction of Signaller A, set the route for the shunt locomotive, but due to the single slip switch configuration, the actual route did not correspond with the one displayed on the mimic screen (3.2.8). This discrepancy between the intended route and the actual track configuration directly contributed to the near-miss incident.

Reliability of Signalling Equipment
The reliability of signalling equipment, including mimic screens and track switches, is a fundamental aspect of railway safety. In this case, the mimic screen misled the signallers by displaying an incorrect route (3.2.8), which suggests a potential issue with the reliability or design of the signalling system. The fact that the actual configuration of the single slip switch did not allow for the route displayed on the mimic screen to be followed indicates a safety concern related to the signalling equipment's ability to accurately reflect the real-world track layout.

Human Factors and Workload Management
Human factors, such as workload and task distribution among signallers, can significantly impact railway safety. Signaller A was multitasking, handling telephone and radio communications with train drivers and maintenance staff (3.2.3), while also overseeing the signal operations. This high workload and the division of responsibilities may have contributed to the oversight in route setting and the subsequent miscommunication with the RCO (3.2.11). The incident underscores the importance of managing workload and ensuring that signallers can focus on critical tasks without being overburdened.

Response to Unusual Situations
The ability to respond effectively to unusual situations, such as equipment faults, is a key safety theme. The track fault observed by the signallers affected train movements (3.2.1), requiring manual operation of the points (3.2.2) and special handling of signal authorizations (3.2.11). The signallers' response to the track fault, including the decision to give verbal authority to bypass a red signal, played a role in the near-miss. This highlights the need for robust procedures and training for handling unexpected or non-standard operating conditions.

Situational Awareness
Maintaining situational awareness is essential for railway safety, particularly for signallers who control train movements. In this incident, there was a lapse in situational awareness as the signallers were unaware that the route set for the shunt locomotive was incorrect due to the single slip switch configuration (3.2.8). The RCO's realization that the track he was on was leading to a different location (3.2.12) prevented a potential accident, indicating the critical role that situational awareness plays in identifying and mitigating risks.
Themes for 2010_206: 
Navigation Over a Bar
Navigation over a bar is a significant safety theme as it involves the complex interplay of natural conditions and ship handling. The document states that "navigating over a Bar requires extreme caution" due to the unpredictable and treacherous wave conditions that can occur (4.2). The presence of a bar at the entrance to a harbor creates special challenges and additional risks for shipping, as the position of navigable channels is always changing in response to environmental factors (4.1). This theme is relevant to the accident because the Spirit of Resolution encountered larger waves after almost completing the bar crossing, which supports the master's decision but also highlights the risks involved in such navigation (4.8).

Ship's Propulsion and Handling in Shoaling Waves
The ability of a ship to maintain propulsion and handling in the presence of shoaling waves is a critical safety theme. The document explains that ships must have "sufficient propulsion to drive through shoaling waves" and that maintaining propeller immersion can be difficult when a ship is pitching into waves (4.3, 4.4). This is relevant to the accident as the Spirit of Resolution was unable to make headway against the shoaling waves and was eventually carried out of the main channel into shallower water where its rudder struck the seabed (4.9).

Weather Forecasting and Risk Assessment
Weather forecasting and risk assessment are key safety themes, as they provide crucial information for decision-making. The Ports of Auckland had conducted a risk assessment and set a four-metre maximum observed wave height restriction for ships crossing the Manukau Bar (4.6). However, the forecast predicted wave heights to build beyond this limit on the day of the accident (4.6). The master's decision to proceed across the Bar might have been influenced by the availability of more accurate information on actual wave conditions (4.11). This theme is relevant because the accident occurred when the ship was crossing the bar right on the limit of maximum safe operating conditions, which were forecast to deteriorate (4.10).

Availability and Reliability of Navigational Aids
The availability and reliability of navigational aids is a safety theme that affects the ability of ships to safely navigate challenging areas such as bars. The document mentions that Ports of Auckland has not attempted to install a wave-rider buoy near the Manukau Bar due to difficulties in maintaining navigation buoys and beacons in the area (4.12). This theme is relevant to the accident as the lack of real-time data on wave conditions could have contributed to the master's decision to cross the Bar under risky conditions (4.15).

Operational Decision-Making
Operational decision-making is a safety theme that encompasses the judgment calls made by ship masters and crew based on available information and experience. The document highlights that the master's decision to proceed across the Bar was a major factor contributing to the accident (4.11). The master and bridge crew believed the wave conditions were acceptable for making the crossing, which turned out to be a misjudgment as the conditions deteriorated (4.7, 4.8). This theme is relevant because it underscores the importance of making informed decisions in the face of uncertain and changing conditions.

Emergency Response and Ship Resilience
Emergency response and ship resilience are safety themes related to the ability of a ship to withstand adverse conditions and the crew's actions in response to emergencies. The Spirit of Resolution's loss of its rudder on the Bar and the subsequent extraordinary effort to clear the Bar into deeper waters highlight the importance of these themes (4.9, 4.10). The ship's design, with its accommodation block near the stern, and the master's use of the bow thruster were factors that helped in clearing the Bar (4.10). This theme is relevant as it relates to the ship's capability to handle extreme conditions and the crew's emergency maneuvers.
Themes for 2011_004: 
Inadequate Maintenance Practices
Inadequate maintenance practices were a significant factor in this accident, as evidenced by the series of defects and incidents involving the nose landing gear assembly that were attributed to improper repair and maintenance spanning several years and multiple maintenance organizations. The report states that "improper repair and maintenance practices spanning several maintenance organisations and individual maintenance engineers over several years contributed to a series of defects and incidents involving the nose landing gear assembly on the aeroplane" (4.44). This theme is relevant because it highlights the systemic nature of the maintenance deficiencies that led to the accident.

Use of Incorrect Parts
The use of incorrect parts in the maintenance of the aircraft was a direct contributor to the accident. The report details that "the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane allowed the nose wheel to turn in excess of the nominal 20°" (5.2.a), and that the incorrect housing was installed due to a part number error (4.8). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of using the correct parts for maintenance to ensure the proper functioning of critical aircraft systems.

Lack of Compliance with Maintenance Procedures
The accident was also related to a lack of compliance with prescribed maintenance procedures. The report indicates that "some of the maintenance had not been performed in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules, particularly in regard to compliance with prescribed maintenance procedures" (4.17). This theme is relevant because it points to the necessity of adhering to established maintenance procedures to maintain aircraft safety.

Recurring Defects Not Properly Addressed
The failure to properly address recurring defects is another safety theme related to this accident. The report finds that "repairing and replacing defective components without identifying the reason for their failure in the first place is a serious safety issue that will likely result in repeat accidents and incidents for the same reasons" (5.4). This theme is relevant as it emphasizes the need for thorough investigation and understanding of the root causes of defects to prevent their recurrence.

Inadequate Supervision and Oversight
Inadequate supervision and oversight of maintenance activities contributed to the accident. The report mentions that "proper supervision should ensure that appropriate fault-finding is carried out" (4.32) and that the high turnover of maintenance controllers hindered the recognition of an emerging trend with the performance of the aeroplane nose wheel landing gear (4.40). This theme is relevant because it highlights the role of supervision in ensuring maintenance quality and in identifying and addressing potential trends that could lead to accidents.

Insufficient Independent Checks
The lack of independent checks after maintenance, especially for non-control systems like the landing gear, is a safety theme related to this accident. The report states that "although much aircraft maintenance is done under supervision, the requirement for a duplicate check after maintenance is limited to a few defined control systems. The landing gear is not one of those systems" (5.5). This theme is relevant as it suggests that additional safeguards, such as independent checks, could help detect and correct maintenance errors that might otherwise lead to serious incidents or accidents.
Themes for 2012_202: 
Passenger Overloading
Passenger overloading is a critical safety theme as it directly impacts the vessel's stability, safety equipment adequacy, and emergency response effectiveness. In the case of the Torea, the vessel was carrying "24 passengers on board when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers" (4.3 (invalid formatted quote)). This overloading could have resulted in a lack of lifejackets for all passengers since "if the Torea had had only the required number of lifejackets on board, not all of the passengers would have had lifejackets in the event of them having to enter the water" (4.3.6). Moreover, overloading can affect the vessel's handling and potentially contribute to the severity of an accident.

Navigation in Hazardous Areas
Navigation in hazardous areas, such as near reefs and rocky outcrops, is a safety theme that is highly relevant to this accident. The Torea's skipper was fishing in an area known for "uncharted rocks" and had to maneuver "close to rocks and rocky outcrops at slow speed" (4.2.1). Despite the skipper's experience and the use of a navigation system that "showed all his previous tracks in the area" (4.2.3), the vessel still collided with a rock. This indicates that navigating in such areas requires additional caution and possibly better risk mitigation strategies.

Crew Communication and Coordination
Effective crew communication and coordination are essential for maintaining safety on board. In the Torea incident, a crew member was in the process of alerting the master about the reducing water depth when the collision occurred (4.2.4). This suggests that either the communication was not timely or the coordination between the crew's observations and the master's actions was insufficient to prevent the accident. Additionally, the deckhand failed to verify the number of passengers, relying instead on the trip leader's incorrect information (4.3.4). These communication and coordination lapses are significant safety themes in this context.

Adherence to Vessel Certification Limits
Adherence to vessel certification limits is a safety theme that encompasses the vessel's operational parameters, including passenger capacity. The Torea was not compliant with its certification, as it exceeded the maximum number of passengers allowed (4.3). The skipper's responsibility to ensure compliance with these limits is crucial for safety, as the certification "takes into consideration more than just the available life-saving equipment" (4.3.7). This theme is relevant because non-adherence can compromise the vessel's safety and the effectiveness of emergency responses.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency preparedness and response is a safety theme that involves the readiness of the crew to handle emergencies and the effectiveness of the rescue operations. In the Torea's case, the crew's actions post-collision were "well thought out and co-ordinated" (4.1.4), and the emergency services responded rapidly and effectively, resulting in the rescue of all passengers and crew without injury. This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of having a well-prepared crew and efficient emergency services, which can significantly reduce the severity of outcomes in maritime accidents.

Reliance on Past Experience and Technology
Reliance on past experience and technology for navigation is a safety theme that can have both positive and negative implications. The Torea's skipper relied on his "previous experience" and a "computerised navigation system" to navigate around hazardous areas (4.2.2, 4.2.3). While these tools are generally beneficial, the accident demonstrates that they are not infallible. The skipper's decision to increase speed based on his interpretation of the navigation data led to the collision (4.2.4). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for continuous situational awareness and caution, even when technology suggests safety.
Themes for 2013_202: 
Pilotage Procedures and Compliance
The theme of pilotage procedures and compliance is highly relevant to this accident as it highlights the discrepancy between the actual practices of the pilots and the established rules and regulations. The report indicates that "the pilot handed control of the navigation of the idas bulker to the master while the vessel was still in the compulsory pilotage area, and without an arrangement for remote pilotage" (4.4.5). This action was contrary to the requirements of the Maritime Rules and the Hawke's Bay Regional Council Navigation Safety Bylaws, which state that a pilot should be in control of the navigation within the pilotage area (4.4.4). Furthermore, the report finds that "the procedures used by Napier pilots as contained in Port of Napier's Outward Pilotage procedures have not been aligned with the appropriate rules and legislation since 2003" (5.6). This misalignment between practice and regulation is a significant safety theme as it directly impacts the safe navigation of vessels within the pilotage area.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation by Ship's Master
The theme of risk assessment and mitigation by the ship's master is central to this accident, as it involves the decision-making process of the master of the IDAS Bulker when faced with a navigational challenge. The master was concerned about the proximity of an inbound vessel and decided to navigate south of North Pania Buoy to increase separation (5.2). To mitigate the risk of navigating closer to Pania Reef, the master "confirmed with the second officer the depth of water available and fixing the position of the vessel more frequently" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates the master's proactive approach to ensuring the safety of the vessel in the absence of a pilot, which was a direct result of the aforementioned non-compliance with pilotage procedures.

Navigational Aids and Buoyage System Understanding
Understanding of the navigational aids and buoyage system is a safety theme that emerges from the accident, as it pertains to the correct interpretation and use of navigational marks like the North Pania Buoy. The report explains that the North Pania Buoy is a north cardinal mark under the IALA System "A" and indicates that the deepest and safest water lies to the north (4.2.6). However, it also notes that "it does not mean that the north cardinal mark cannot be safely passed to the south by vessels that have sufficiently shallow draughts" (4.2.6). The master's decision to pass south of the buoy, while unconventional, was based on his understanding of the buoyage system and the vessel's draught, which is a critical aspect of safe navigation.

Pilotage Area Boundaries and Legal Definitions
The theme of pilotage area boundaries and legal definitions is relevant to this accident as it highlights the confusion and lack of clarity regarding the extent of the pilotage area and the responsibilities of pilots and masters within it. The report finds that "napier pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the napier pilotage area and that the outward pilotage limit was not legal" (4.5.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Additionally, the report states that "no-one in the Regional Council or the Port Authority and none of the pilots themselves realised that the procedures for outward pilotage were in error" (5.8). This lack of awareness and understanding of the legal definitions and boundaries of the pilotage area could lead to unsafe practices and is therefore a significant safety theme.

Communication and Coordination Between Vessels
Communication and coordination between vessels is a safety theme that arises from the master of the IDAS Bulker's actions to ensure a safe passing distance from an inbound vessel. The master "called the other vessel to agree on passing arrangements, as the pilot had suggested he should" (4.2.1). This theme is relevant because effective communication and coordination are critical for the safe navigation of vessels, especially in situations where there is a potential for close-quarters situations or when the pilot is not on board to assist.

Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement
Regulatory oversight and enforcement is a safety theme that is implicated in this accident due to the apparent lack of adherence to established maritime rules and the failure to correct these deviations over time. The report indicates that "the procedures used by napier pilots as contained in port of napier's outward pilotage procedures had not been aligned with the appropriate rules and legislation since 2003" (5.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) and that opportunities to identify and correct the errors were missed during reviews of the Bylaws (4.5.6). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for effective oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that maritime operations are conducted in accordance with the relevant safety regulations.
Themes for 2011_202: 
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) Practices
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that encompasses the methodology and behavior covering all aspects of bridge operations, including the use of all available resources to prevent accidents. In the case of the Monte Stello, the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance, which is a key aspect of BRM ("the monte stello collided with the rock because it deviated from the planned passage. there was, however, evidence that the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Furthermore, the error in rudder direction was not picked up in time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as BRM, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team ("The error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team" (5.4)).

Shared Mental Model
A shared mental model is a concept where the members of a team share the same understanding of the operation to be performed and the teamwork involved. This theme is relevant to the accident because the bridge team did not have a shared mental model, which would have allowed them to notice, challenge, and correct the deviation from the expected actions ("An underlying principle of eradicating error within teams is the concept of a shared mental model" (4.2.7)). The lack of a shared mental model contributed to the accident as the bridge team did not engage effectively as a team, sharing the same understanding of where the ship was and what was planned next ("aside from what the helmsman thought, had the bridge team been more engaged as a team, sharing the same understanding of where the ship was and what was planned next, it is more likely the helmsman and/or lookout would have recognized that for the master to give a starboard helm order in that situation would be unusual" (4.3.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Closed Loop Communication
Closed loop communication is a method of communication where an instruction is given, acknowledged, and then confirmed to ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the parties involved. This theme is relevant because the accident occurred partly due to the failure to use closed loop communication consistently, which allowed the error in rudder direction to go uncorrected ("Closed loop communication was not used and hence the opportunity to correct the error was lost" (4.3.7)). The importance of closed loop communication is emphasized in the Fleet Operating Procedures manual and its failure was a contributing factor to the accident ("The process they followed was a textbook example of closed loop communication as described in KiwiRail's Fleet Operating Procedures manual" (4.3.5)).

Pilot/Co-Pilot System
The pilot/co-pilot system is a procedural defense where one officer is responsible for executing maneuvers while another officer follows up on all maneuvers and navigation made by the pilot. This theme is relevant because the pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes, which contributed to the accident ("The pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was ordered to a location where he was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes" (4.3.13)). The breakdown of this system meant that there was no cross-checking of the master's orders, which allowed the error to occur and go uncorrected.

Safety Management System Audits
Safety management system audits are evaluations of the practices and procedures in place to ensure safe operations. This theme is relevant because both internal and external audits had previously found that generally BRM practices were operating effectively, but they also raised questions about the level of BRM training given to the bridge teams, including for existing junior officers and for new crew ("Both internal and external audits found that generally BRM practices were operating effectively. However, they also both raised questions about the level of BRM training given to the bridge teams" (4.4.7)). The Monte Stello had not been fully integrated into KiwiRail's safety management system and was only on a short-term charter, which may have contributed to the ineffective implementation of BRM practices on the accident voyage ("Arguably the standard of navigation and BRM on the Monte Stello posed the biggest risk to KiwiRail" (4.4.9)).

Crew Familiarity and Composition
Crew familiarity and composition refer to the level of experience and the ability of the crew to work together effectively as a team. This theme is relevant because the accident voyage was the first time the bridge team had worked together to transit Tory Channel, and the helmsman had neither acted as helmsman on the Monte Stello nor through the entrance to Tory Channel before ("However, the accident voyage was the first time the bridge team had worked together to transit Tory Channel" (4.3.4)). The lack of familiarity among the crew members, especially in critical roles such as the helmsman, contributed to the breakdown in bridge team performance and the subsequent accident.
Themes for 2019_105: 
Track Geometry and Alignment
Track geometry and alignment is a critical safety theme as it pertains to the physical condition and configuration of the railway track, which can directly influence the risk of derailment. In this accident, the track alignment was identified as a contributing factor to the derailment. The curve radius leading up to the point of derailment (POD) was "significantly tighter than the absolute minimum prescribed in the current standard" (3.12), and when combined with other track defects and the absence of lubrication on the rail, it likely contributed to the derailment (3.12). Furthermore, the track faults identified during a routine inspection were closed out without repair (4.2), indicating a lapse in maintaining the track geometry within safe operational limits.

Wheel/Rail Interface
The wheel/rail interface is a safety theme that involves the interaction between the train wheels and the rail, which is fundamental to safe railway operations. In this incident, the wheel flange surface roughness of the wagon was found to be outside the specified limits, "exceeding the maximum permitted by a factor of two to four" (3.23). This increased friction at the wheel/rail interface and, in combination with the track geometry issues, increased the likelihood of a wheel climb derailment (3.24). The condition of the wheel/rail interface is thus directly relevant to the accident as it was a factor that increased the risk of derailment.

Maintenance and Inspection Compliance
Maintenance and inspection compliance is a safety theme that involves adhering to established standards and schedules for the upkeep and examination of railway equipment and infrastructure. In this case, there were lapses in compliance with maintenance standards. The KiwiRail Mechanical Code specified a maximum wheel flange surface roughness of 12.5 micrometres, but the actual roughness was estimated to be between 25-50 micrometres (3.23). Additionally, track faults identified by the track evaluation car were not closed out in accordance with company standards (3.14-3.17), indicating a failure to comply with maintenance and inspection protocols, which is relevant to the accident as it allowed for the persistence of conditions that contributed to the derailment.

Load Distribution and Wagon Design
Load distribution and wagon design are safety themes related to how cargo is loaded onto wagons and the design of the wagons themselves, which can affect the stability of the train. In this accident, wagon UKK9599 was carrying an evenly loaded, 40-foot container (3.28), and no load imbalance was identified (3.28). However, the design of the UKK-class wagon, when conveying a 40-foot container, slightly reduced the wagon's ability to negotiate long-wheelbase track twists (3.29). This theme is relevant because the ability of the wagon to negotiate the track safely was at the limit, contributing to the derailment (4.2).

Speed Management
Speed management is a safety theme that involves controlling the speed of the train to ensure it is appropriate for the track conditions and operational environment. In this incident, the train was traveling at 25 km/h when the driver reduced power to slow the train to what they understood was the maximum authorised line speed of 20 km/h, coinciding with the derailment of wagon UKK9599 (3.31). Although the Commission determined that the speed was unlikely to have contributed to the derailment (3.32), speed management remains a relevant safety theme as it is a critical factor in the safe operation of trains and the prevention of accidents.

Organisational Safety Culture
Organisational safety culture is a safety theme that encompasses the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. The report indicates that KiwiRail could not provide evidence that certain track faults had been inspected and repaired by the target dates (3.15, 3.17), and the fault had been recorded as closed out without inspection or repair (3.15). This suggests issues with the safety culture within the organisation, as proper procedures for addressing safety issues were not followed. The relevance of this theme to the accident is underscored by the fact that unaddressed track faults and wheel condition were contributing factors to the derailment (4.2).
Themes for 2010_006: 
Communication Procedures
Communication procedures are critical for ensuring that all parties operating within an airport environment are aware of each other's actions and intentions. This theme is relevant to the accident because the Avsec officer made a radio call before entering the runway, but the pilots did not hear it, likely due to being engaged in the critical touchdown phase of flight ("the avsec officer did make a radio call immediately prior to entering the runway, but the pilots did not hear it" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). Furthermore, the Avsec officer assumed that by making the call, he had the right of way to the runway, showing a lack of understanding of the need for communication to be received and acknowledged by others ("The Avsec officer knew that he had to make a radio call, but it would seem that he assumed that by having made the call he had the right of way to the runway" (4.9)).

Training and Awareness
Training and awareness of airport operations and procedures are essential for all personnel to ensure the safety of airport operations. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer lacked a thorough knowledge of the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting, which contributed to the incident ("Had the Avsec officer had a more 'thorough knowledge of the operational environment', including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting, the incident would likely not have occurred" (4.16)). Additionally, the officer had not been trained to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules, which would have included an understanding that illuminated runway lights indicated an active runway ("This lack of awareness, together with the speed with which he entered the runway without conducting an effective visual check to ensure it was clear, suggested that the officer had not been trained in these aspects to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules" (4.13)).

Procedural Compliance
Adherence to established procedures is a fundamental aspect of aviation safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because there was no procedure for Avsec officers to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before entering the runway outside normal hours of ATC, which was a missed opportunity that could have averted the near collision ("There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before the officer entered the runway outside the normal hours of ATC" (4.7)). Moreover, the Avsec officer's decision to enter the runway was influenced by an established unauthorized practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable, which was against the airport company's procedures ("A factor contributing to the Avsec officer's decision to enter the runway was the established unauthorised practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable" (5.4)).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves understanding the current and future states of the environment to make informed decisions. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer did not appreciate that flights could be delayed or that aircraft movements could occur at any time, nor did he understand that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active ("The Avsec officer's decision was also probably influenced by his not expecting any aircraft movements at that time" (4.13)). The officer's tunnel focus on completing his own tasks with little regard for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation also indicates a lack of situational awareness ("The Avsec officer's actions were indicative of a 'tunnel' focus on completing his own tasks with little regard for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation" (4.9)).

Coordination Between Personnel
Effective coordination between personnel is necessary to ensure that all operational activities are conducted safely and in harmony. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer did not liaise with the airport company night security agent and was therefore unaware of the impending aircraft arrival ("Having not liaised with the airport company night security agent, the Avsec officer did not know about the impending aircraft arrival" (4.5)). Additionally, the absence of a procedure to allow access to the runway when ATC was not in attendance and no requirement for a pre-shift briefing or coordination with the airport company meant that the Avsec officer was inadequately prepared to make the proper decision about entering the runway ("The absence of a procedure to allow access to the runway when ATC was not in attendance, and no requirement for a pre-shift briefing or co-ordination with the airport company meant that the Avsec officer was inadequately prepared" (5.5)).

Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions, such as weather, can significantly impact visibility and the ability to detect hazards. This theme is relevant because the heavy rain and darkness reduced visibility to the extent that the pilots did not see the vehicle on the runway and were unaware of the high collision risk until later ("the combination of rain and darkness reduced the visibility to the extent that the pilots did not see the vehicle on the runway" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). The rain and reflected lights also reduced the night security agent's ability to assess the position of the Avsec vehicle, which contributed to the incident ("The rain and reflected lights also reduced the agent's ability to assess the position of the Avsec vehicle" (4.8)).
Themes for 2020_103: 
Habituation to Routine
Habituation to routine is a safety theme where the repetition of a task leads to a reduction in conscious attention to the task, potentially resulting in a lack of preparedness for unexpected events. This theme is relevant to the accident because the driver had been employed by Uzabus for five years and had been on the same daily route since 9 days prior to the accident, crossing the level crossing 10 times per day. This repetition likely led to habit formation, where "neural activity is limited to the start and finish of the task, with relatively little activity during the task itself" (3.3.6 (invalid formatted quote)). The driver's behavior at the level crossing would likely have followed a habitual pattern, and it is likely that the driver did not expect to encounter a train on the crossing and had not previously encountered a train there (3.3.7).

Driver Expectation and Attention
Driver expectation and attention is a safety theme that involves how a driver's expectations and where they focus their attention can influence their ability to detect and respond to hazards. In this accident, the driver's attention was likely on the road ahead, judging a gap in the traffic to turn through, rather than on looking to see if the lights were flashing at the level crossing (3.3.8). The driver's expectation, based on their routine, would not have included encountering a train, which likely contributed to the driver not registering the level crossing warning devices in time to react and stop the bus before the level crossing (4.2).

Effectiveness of Level Crossing Warnings
The effectiveness of level crossing warnings is a safety theme that examines how well warning devices capture the attention of drivers and prompt the appropriate response. In this case, the level crossing protections were found to be in accordance with the relevant manual and operating correctly immediately prior to the accident (3.1.4). However, the driver may not have seen or registered the level crossing warning devices due to their attentional focus on oncoming road traffic (3.3.8). This suggests that while the warning devices were functioning, they may not have been effective in capturing the driver's attention in this particular context.

Regulatory Changes and Compliance
Regulatory changes and compliance is a safety theme that looks at how changes in laws and rules can influence the behavior of individuals and the safety of operations. The report mentions that prior to 2009, passenger service vehicles were required to stop before all level crossings unless exempt signs or barrier arms were installed. However, amendments made to the Land Transport (Road User) Rule 2004 removed the requirement for a passenger service vehicle to stop at a level crossing if active protection like flashing signals was installed (3.4.1). This change in regulation may have influenced the driver's behavior by removing the habit of stopping at the crossing, which could have reduced the risk of collision (3.4.14).

Interaction with Road Intersections
Interaction with road intersections is a safety theme that considers the additional risks posed by level crossings that are in close proximity to road intersections. The report indicates that the amendments to the Rule did not consider the risks to road and rail users at level crossings near road intersections (3.4.17). The accident occurred as the driver was likely focused on maneuvering the bus through a right-hand turn and did not register the active warning devices in time (4.2). The proximity of the level crossing to the intersection may have contributed to the driver's divided attention and the subsequent accident.

Human Factors in Unexpected Events
Human factors in unexpected events is a safety theme that involves how drivers process and respond to unexpected situations. The report discusses two information-processing modes activated when a driver is faced with an unexpected event: automatic and attentive (3.3.5). In this accident, observing the flashing lights was an unexpected event for the driver, leading to an attentive response that is usually slower and has a greater likelihood of error (3.3.8). The driver's likely attentive response to the flashing lights, as opposed to an automatic response, may have delayed their reaction time, contributing to the accident (3.3.13).
Themes for 2012_102: 
Design and Installation of Emergency Power Systems
The design and installation of the emergency power systems were critical factors in this accident. The project team responsible for the Auckland train control centralisation project lacked the appropriate expertise for designing and installing the emergency power supply system, which resulted in a single electrical fault causing a power outage to a much wider portion of the system than should have been affected. "Weaknesses in the design and installation of the emergency power distribution system for train control resulted in an electrical fault that should have been detected and contained in one part of the electrical distribution system, causing a power outage to a much wider portion of the system" (5.2). Furthermore, the UPS devices were not designed with redundancy in mind, creating a single point of failure for Auckland's train control (4.3.9).

Risk Management Policy
KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy did not adequately consider the safety of passengers and crew for the continuity of core services like train control. The policy was based on freight train operations and did not feature passenger services, which led to an underestimation of the impact of train control failure on passenger safety. "KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy for 'continuity of core services' did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed, causing the widespread stoppage of an entire metropolitan passenger rail system" (5.4).

Circuit Breaker Discrimination
The accident highlighted issues with circuit breaker discrimination within the emergency power supply system. The circuit breakers were not installed with the appropriate discrimination between them, which should have isolated the fault to a smaller section rather than affecting all four Auckland workstations. "Without the appropriate discrimination between the two circuit breakers, after a period of less than one second from the initial fault occurring circuit breaker W14 tripped, causing the loss of power to all four Auckland workstations" (4.2.7).

Management and Maintenance of Emergency Power Supply
The management and maintenance of the emergency power supply system were insufficient to ensure the integrity of what had been designated an "essential service." There was a lack of familiarity with the operation of the UPS among KiwiRail technicians, no regular test program of the emergency power supply system, and no regular checks of UPS loading or alarm status. "The management and maintenance of the emergency power supply system for train control were not sufficient to ensure the reliability of what had been designated an 'essential service'" (5.5).

UPS Capacity and Redundancy
The UPS capacity and redundancy were not properly considered during the design phase, which led to the entire Auckland train control being dependent on a single UPS unit. This lack of redundancy meant that a failure in one part of the system could bring down the entire network. "All four of the Auckland train controller workstations were connected to the same UPS, creating a single point of failure for Auckland's train control" (4.3.9).

Training and Expertise
There was a lack of training and expertise among the personnel involved in the project, which contributed to the accident. The KiwiRail engineer who reviewed the electrical design was not familiar with the plan layout format used in the commercial electrical design specifications, and the UPS support technician allocated to the project team left during the design phase without a knowledgeable replacement. "The electrical design was reviewed by a KiwiRail engineer, but he said he was more familiar with line-type diagrams than the plan layout format used in the commercial electrical design specifications, and he did not see any associated UPS load calculations" (4.3.12).
Themes for 2012_104: 
Human Performance Limitations
Human performance limitations are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the driver's ability to operate safely was compromised by several factors, including potential fatigue, medication, and alcohol intake. The report states that "humans do not operate with absolute accuracy" and that "boredom, distraction, fatigue, illness, anxiety, misunderstanding and sensory problems lead to less-than-optimal performance" (4.1.1). Additionally, the driver had been prescribed medications that "either singularly or collectively had the potential to adversely affect his performance" (4.3.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and he was consuming alcohol at levels that could impair his ability to drive safely (4.3.11). These factors likely contributed to the driver's error in overrunning the limits of his track warrant (4.3.5, 4.3.14).

Inadequate Control Mechanisms
Inadequate control mechanisms are a safety theme in this accident because the existing procedures and technologies were not sufficient to prevent the overrun of the track warrant limit. The report highlights that "there was little or no warning systems built into kiwirail's procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant system failing due to human error" (4.2.15 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Although there were procedures in place designed to capture such an error, they were not effective in this case (4.2.2). The introduction of the 'Watchdog' software application after the incident, which provides automatic alerts when a train exceeds its track warrant limits, addresses this safety issue (4.2.17-4.2.21).

Procedural Non-Compliance
Procedural non-compliance is a safety theme because both the train driver and the train controller did not adhere to the required procedures, which contributed to the incident. The driver did not follow the procedure for checking the limits of his track warrant (4.3.3), and the train controller did not follow the required procedures for checking and monitoring the progress of the southbound train (4.2.9). This non-compliance resulted in a missed opportunity to detect the driver's error and prevent the track warrant overrun (4.2.7, 4.2.9).

Inadequate Health Assessments
Inadequate health assessments are a safety theme because the driver was allowed to continue in a safety-critical role despite medical conditions and medications that could impair his performance. The report identifies that the driver's medical status was not well managed, and the correlation of medical information between health professionals was poor (4.3.16). KiwiRail's health professionals and the driver's manager did not have all the information required to make meaningful assessments of the driver's fitness for duty (4.3.16). The driver was declared "fit for duty" without reporting his current prescribed medications (4.4.9).

Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a safety theme because the driver's misunderstanding of his track warrant limit was not corrected due to a failure in communication between the driver and the train controller. The driver was under the impression that his track warrant terminated at a different station than it actually did, and this error was not caught during the required clause 10 call (4.2.7). The train controller missed the opportunity to correct the driver's mistake due to not complying with the operating instructions (4.2.9).

Training and Knowledge Deficiencies
Training and knowledge deficiencies are a safety theme because the train controller's lack of knowledge contributed to the incident. The train controller had previously demonstrated errors in his understanding of the track warrant control administration during his biennial train control theory assessment (4.2.10). The ambiguity in the instruction regarding the requirement for an 80% pass mark and the subsequent actions taken by KiwiRail did not address the train controller's knowledge deficiencies adequately (4.2.13, 4.2.14). This lack of knowledge was a factor that contributed to the incident (4.2.14).
Themes for 2011_106: 
Assumptions about the locations of trains
The theme of assumptions about the locations of trains is highly relevant to this accident because the train controller authorized a track occupation without verifying the actual location of the passenger train. The controller made an "assumption based on what he was told by the person-in-charge of the worksite" and did not confirm the train's position, which is a violation of KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules (4.2.1, 4.2.2). This assumption led to the near-collision, highlighting the risk and the need for continual and proper management of such assumptions (4.2, 4.2.7).

Visibility of trains on the rail network
The visibility of trains on the rail network is a critical safety theme in this accident because the passenger train was not electronically visible to the train controller when he authorized the track occupation. A significant portion of the rail network is not electronically visible to train control, which requires train controllers to rely on other mechanisms to anticipate and verify train movements (4.3, 4.3.1). The lack of electronic visibility contributed to the train controller's error, as he did not register the absence of the passenger train on his mimic screen (4.3.3).

Train controller wellbeing - nutrition and rest breaks
Train controller wellbeing, specifically regarding nutrition and rest breaks, is a pertinent safety theme because the train controller had not eaten for about 15 hours before the incident, which could have contributed to mental fatigue and the subsequent error (4.4, 4.4.4). The Commission's report emphasizes the importance of train controllers eating properly and regularly during their shifts to maintain peak mental form, as well as the need for KiwiRail to ensure that train controllers treat diet and nutrition seriously (4.4.7, 4.4.8).

Communication clarity and verification
Clear communication and the need for verification is a significant safety theme because the incident was exacerbated by a miscommunication between the person-in-charge and the train controller. The person-in-charge's comment about a "subby" passing led the train controller to make incorrect assumptions about the train's location (4.2.5). Additionally, the train driver's practice of reducing the volume on his radio meant he missed an opportunity to intervene and prevent the conflict (4.5.2).

Adherence to safety protocols and procedures
Adherence to safety protocols and procedures is a central theme, as the train controller did not follow KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules that required verification of all train movements before granting track occupation authorizations (4.2.1). The incident underscores the importance of strict adherence to established safety protocols to prevent such near-misses and potential collisions (4.2.7, 4.2.9).

Use of technology for train monitoring
The use of technology for train monitoring is a relevant safety theme because the lack of real-time electronic visibility of train movements contributed to the incident. The Commission noted that if the train controller had access to global positioning technology, he would have been able to see that it was not safe to authorize the track occupation (4.3.6, 4.3.8). The development of systems like "GeVis" using global positioning technology is a step towards improving safety by providing train controllers with accurate locations of all trains (4.3.9).
Themes for 2016_203: 
Use of Safety Harnesses
The use of safety harnesses is a critical safety theme in this accident. The deck cadet was working at a significant height above the deck and was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall-arrestor device, which is a direct violation of the ship's safety management system requirements. "the deck cadet was working about eight metres above the ship's main deck... he was not wearing a safety harness attached to a fall-arrestor device" (4.2.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The absence of a safety harness directly contributed to the severity of the accident, as "If he had been [wearing a safety harness attached to a fall arrestor] it is virtually certain that he would not have lost his life" (5.2). This theme is relevant because the proper use of safety harnesses could have prevented the fall or at least mitigated the consequences.

Safety Culture
Safety culture is a theme that is deeply intertwined with this accident. The report indicates that not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was normal behavior on the ship, and nobody questioned or called a halt to the unsafe practice. "Not wearing appropriate fall-prevention equipment was normal behaviour on Mount Hikurangi" (4.5.1). This acceptance of risk and the lack of proactive safety measures reflect a poorly developed safety culture onboard, as evidenced by the internal audit findings and the continuation of unsafe practices even after the accident. "The audit findings were indicative of a poorly developed safety culture on board" (4.5.5). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that a strong safety culture could have encouraged compliance with safety procedures and potentially prevented the accident.

Compliance with Safety Procedures
Compliance with safety procedures is a significant safety theme in this accident. The crew's routine non-compliance with the requirement to wear safety harnesses and use fall arrestors when lashing logs on deck is a clear example. "None of the crew was wearing a safety harness on the day of the accident" (4.4.1), and "the crew routinely did not comply with those company requirements" (5.3). This theme is relevant because adherence to established safety procedures is fundamental to preventing accidents, and the lack of compliance in this case was a direct factor in the occurrence and severity of the accident.

Leadership and Example Setting
Leadership and example setting is a theme that played a role in this accident. The deck officers, including the chief officer, did not set an example for the crew by wearing safety harnesses themselves, nor did they insist that the deck crew wear them. "However, the deck officers did not set an example to the crew by wearing safety harnesses themselves" (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because leadership behavior strongly influences crew practices and attitudes towards safety. Effective leadership could have ensured adherence to safety protocols and possibly prevented the accident.

Risk Perception
Risk perception is a theme that is evident in the accident. The crew, including the deck cadet, underestimated the risk associated with working at height near the ship's side. "Their perception of the risk was low" (4.4.4). This theme is relevant because an accurate perception of risk is crucial for recognizing the need for and the use of safety measures. If the crew had a higher awareness of the risks, they might have been more diligent in using fall-prevention equipment.

Training and Mentorship
Training and mentorship is a theme that emerges from the circumstances of the accident. The deck cadet was relatively inexperienced and was expected to be mentored by another officer and taught appropriate safe working practices. "The company's expectation was for the cadet to be mentored by another officer and taught the appropriate safe working practices" (4.4.4). This theme is relevant because proper training and mentorship are essential for ensuring that all crew members, especially new ones, understand and follow safety procedures. In this case, the lack of effective mentorship contributed to the cadet working without fall-prevention equipment, leading to the fatal outcome.
Themes for 2012_101: 
Load Securing Practices
Load securing practices are a critical safety theme in this accident, as the load was not secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, leading to it shifting outside the standard loading gauge. The report states that "the load shifted outside the standard loading gauge, and struck several track-side structures and another train, because it had not been secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code" (5.1). Furthermore, "only half the required number of webbing strops had been used to secure the load and none had edge protectors fitted to prevent them fraying" (5.2), which indicates a failure to properly secure the load as per the established safety guidelines.

Equipment Availability
Equipment availability is another safety theme related to this accident. The MDD class special-movement wagon used to transport the load lacked the appropriate load-securing equipment, which would have been necessary to secure the load in compliance with the Freight Handling Code. The report finds that "the mdd class special-movement wagon allocated to transport the load from dunedin to christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of proper equipment contributed to the inability to secure the load safely.

Staff Training and Familiarity with Safety Codes
Staff training and familiarity with safety codes are central to this accident, as none of the KiwiRail staff involved with loading and securing the load were sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code. The report highlights this issue, stating "None of KiwiRail's staff involved with loading and securing the load was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code" (5.4). This lack of knowledge and training among the staff directly impacted the safety of the load securing process.

Pre-Departure Inspection Procedures
Pre-departure inspection procedures are a relevant safety theme because the report indicates that the pre-departure train inspections failed to identify the non-compliance of the load securing with the Freight Handling Code. The report notes that "the pre-departure train inspection was the final opportunity to identify 'out-of-Code' loads" (4.3.9), yet neither the rail operator at Dunedin nor the one at Timaru identified the issue. This suggests that the inspection procedures were either inadequate or not properly followed.

Safety Management System Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the safety management system is a safety theme in this accident, as the Freight Handling Code was part of KiwiRail's safety management system but was not effectively implemented or followed. The report states that "The Freight Handling Code was an integral component of KiwiRail's safety management system" (4.3.1), yet the staff were not trained accordingly, and the load was not compliant with the Code when it began its journey (4.3.2). This points to a systemic issue in the safety management practices of the organization.

Organizational Oversight and Regular Safety Assessments
Organizational oversight and regular safety assessments are a safety theme because the report identifies a lack of regular formal safety observations of container terminal operators as a safety issue. It mentions that "KiwiRail had no requirement to conduct regular formal safety observations of container terminal operators" (4.3.3), which is a gap in the safety oversight that could lead to non-compliance with safety codes and practices. Regular assessments are necessary to ensure ongoing adherence to safety standards.
Themes for 2016_004: 
Manufacturing Defects
Manufacturing defects are a critical safety theme as they can lead to unforeseen equipment failures during operation. In this accident, the "number 4 cylinder upper spark plug had been manufactured incorrectly" (4.2), which was a direct cause of the in-flight fire. The spark plug's insulator was not swaged during manufacturing, leading to its ejection after 121 hours of service (4.4). This defect was not detected during quality control checks, highlighting the importance of robust manufacturing processes and inspections to ensure the reliability of critical components.

Quality Control in Supply Chain
The quality control in the supply chain is a safety theme that ensures parts are genuine and meet the required standards before being installed in aircraft. In this case, the spark plugs passed through several agents, including automotive suppliers, before reaching the aviation parts supplier (4.11). Although the failed spark plug was confirmed to be a genuine part (4.11), the incident raises concerns about the traceability and inspection of parts within the aviation supply chain. The fact that "spark plugs generally do not have individual or batch identifying marks" (4.11) complicates the traceability and quality assurance of such components.

Component Certification and Usage Approval
Component certification and usage approval are vital to ensure that all parts used in aviation are suitable for their intended use. The DENSO W24EMR-C spark plug was "not approved" for use on aircraft according to the manufacturer, yet it was used in the helicopter's ignition system (4.17). EASA's position that the approval of a part like a spark plug is always as part of an engine, not independently, indicates a potential gap in the certification process (4.19). This theme is relevant as it questions the adequacy of the certification process in verifying the suitability of components for aviation use.

Pilot Response to Emergency Situations
The pilot's response to emergency situations is a safety theme that can significantly affect the outcome of an incident. In this accident, the "pilot's prompt actions were appropriate and commendable" (5.3), as the immediate landing prevented a more serious outcome. This theme is relevant because it underscores the importance of pilot training and decision-making in successfully managing in-flight emergencies.

Fire Risk Management
Fire risk management is a safety theme that involves the prevention, detection, and suppression of fires in aircraft. The in-flight fire in this incident was initiated by the ejection of the spark plug insulator, which led to hot combustion gases impinging on combustible materials (5.1, 5.2). The proximity of flammable components like the fibreglass baffling and carbon-fibre fuselage to potential ignition sources (4.6) highlights the need for careful design and maintenance practices to mitigate the risk of fire.

Rare Component Failure Implications
The implications of rare component failures are a safety theme that considers the broader impact of infrequent but potentially catastrophic events. Although the type of spark plug failure in this accident is "so rare that it does not have significant implications for aviation safety" (5.6), it still resulted in a serious incident. This theme is relevant as it prompts the industry to consider how to address low-probability, high-impact events, including the potential need for changes in design, maintenance, or operational procedures to prevent recurrence.
Themes for 2019_107: 
Distraction Management
Distraction management is a critical safety theme as it directly relates to the driver's ability to maintain focus and avoid prioritizing the wrong tasks during critical operations. In the incident, the Melling train driver became "distracted by an overheard radio conversation" (3.7) at a crucial moment when approaching a Red-Stop signal, leading to a Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) event (4.2). The importance of a train driver's ability to "focus and avoid distraction at critical times" (3.4) is emphasized, and the incident demonstrates the consequences when distraction occurs.

Signalling System Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the signalling system is a pertinent safety theme as it is designed to "prevent unsafe conditions" and "provide adequate separation between trains" (3.9). However, the incident reveals that the signalling system's effectiveness can be compromised when a driver fails to respond to signals due to distraction or other factors (3.12). The fact that "the signals reduced the likelihood of a SPAD occurring, but were dependent on a train driver responding to them" (3.12) underscores the need for additional fail-safe mechanisms.

Fail-Safe Backup Systems
Fail-safe backup systems are a significant safety theme because they serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of human error or system failure. The report indicates that "another control commonly used to minimise the risk of collision is a fail-safe back-up system that automatically activates train brakes in situations like SPADs" (3.13). However, not all signals, including signal 100 which was overrun, were equipped with such systems (3.16), highlighting the need for more comprehensive implementation of fail-safe controls.

Driver Experience and Training
Driver experience and training are crucial safety themes, as the proficiency and preparedness of train drivers play a vital role in preventing accidents. The Melling driver had recently completed training and had "just over three weeks of solo driving experience" (3.3), which suggests that despite training, the driver's relative inexperience may have contributed to the incident. The report emphasizes the importance of training for "managing distraction" and the attributes of a good train driver (3.3, 3.4), indicating that ongoing training and experience are essential for safe operations.

Operational Risk Assessment
Operational risk assessment is a key safety theme, as it involves evaluating the potential risks and consequences of train operations in specific areas. The report states that the likelihood of a head-on collision at Wellington Station "has been assessed as low," but the potential consequences as "major" (3.1). This assessment is relevant to the accident because it underscores the importance of understanding and mitigating risks in congested areas like Wellington Station, where the incident occurred.

Infrastructure Constraints
Infrastructure constraints are a relevant safety theme because physical limitations can impact the effectiveness of safety measures. The report notes that the "geographically constrained area" of Wellington Station provides "insufficient space to facilitate the required overlaps readily" for fail-safe systems (3.14). This constraint is significant in the context of the accident because it limits the ability to implement engineering solutions that could prevent or mitigate the severity of collisions (3.15, 3.16).
Themes for 2015_201: 
Training and Familiarization
The theme of training and familiarization is highly relevant to this accident as the master of the Kea was not properly trained in and familiar with the vessel's propulsion control system. The report states that "the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was properly trained in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5). Furthermore, the master had "a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various back-up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea" (5.3). This lack of adequate training and familiarity with the control system and its emergency procedures contributed to the master's inability to prevent the collision.

Control System Reliability
Control system reliability is a central safety theme in this accident, as the vessel was known to have faults with the follow-up mode of its propulsion control system, which had previously resulted in incidents. The report highlights that "the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow-up mode of operation, despite the company knowing that there were faults with that mode that were resulting in incidents" (4.1.5). The master's unsuccessful attempt to transfer control of the propulsion units, due to either not fully depressing the give-away button or a potential intermittent fault, directly led to the loss of control and subsequent collision (4.2.1, 4.2.5).

Risk Management
Risk management is a significant safety theme as Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service. The report finds that "Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service" (5.5). The company's failure to undertake a proper risk assessment when reliability issues with the control system were known, and the decision to reintroduce the vessel to service without resolving these issues, are indicative of inadequate risk management practices (4.4.1, 4.4.2).

Surveyor Oversight
Surveyor oversight is a pertinent safety theme as neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system. The report indicates that "neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5). The lack of scrutiny by a surveyor, especially given the critical nature of the control system and its known issues, represents a significant oversight that could have provided an additional level of assurance regarding system reliability (4.5.6, 4.5.9).

Audible and Visual Alarms
The functionality and use of audible and visual alarms are a safety theme in this accident, as the master relied on the audible alarm to confirm the transfer of control, which was misleading. The report notes that "it is likely that the master believed he had control of the starboard propulsion by the unfortunate timing of the aural alarms" (5.2). The master did not confirm the transfer with the visual indicators, and the design of the alarm system was such that it could stop sounding even if control had not been successfully transferred (4.2.6, 4.2.8). This reliance on insufficient alarm systems contributed to the master's incorrect belief that he had control of the vessel.

Passenger Safety Measures
Passenger safety measures, specifically regarding the securing of passenger seating, is a safety theme as the unsecured seats contributed to the injuries sustained by passengers during the collision. The report finds that "securing the seats to the deck would have been a well-considered precaution that would likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers" (5.7). The lack of a requirement to secure seats on a vessel with a transit time of less than 30 minutes, as in the case of the Kea, highlights a gap in safety measures that, if addressed, could have mitigated the harm to passengers (4.6.2, 4.6.4).
Themes for 2016_205: 
Inadequate Fall-Protection System
The inadequate fall-protection system is a central safety theme in this accident. The bosun was working at height with an insufficient fall-protection system, which directly contributed to the fatal outcome. The operator's risk assessment process failed to prevent the bosun from working at height with this inadequate system, as "the operator's risk assessment process did not prevent the bosun working at height with an inadequate fall-protection system" (4.3). Furthermore, the bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task, as "the bosun's safety harness was not fit for the task he was performing" (5.3), and the harness should have had a more robust hook and lanyard arrangement, designed to be tied back on itself and with dual lanyards to enable safe transfers between securing points (5.3).

Lack of Proper Risk Assessment
The lack of a proper risk assessment is another significant safety theme. The initial risk assessment did not adequately distinguish between the different risks associated with working at various heights on the ship, particularly on the crane-jib where the accident occurred. The report states that "the initial risk assessment had not distinguished between working at height on the crane-house and working out on the crane-jib" (4.3.3). A task-specific risk assessment should have identified that additional control measures were required (4.3.3), and the risk assessment conducted prior to the wire replacement did not fulfill the requirements of the operator's safety management system because it did not adequately identify and manage the risks associated with the task (5.4).

Inadequate Safety Management and Culture
Inadequate safety management and culture aboard the vessel is a critical safety theme. The safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice, as evidenced by the crew's repeated failures to comply with safe working practices when working at height (5.5). The report highlights that "the safety management system and the underlying safety culture on board did not meet industry good practice" (4.1.2). This poor safety culture is further illustrated by the fact that working at height without wearing fall-protection equipment had been observed on board on two occasions (4.5.5), and the crew did not fully understand fall-prevention systems or the dangers associated with working at height (4.5.6).

Improper Use of Safety Equipment
The improper use of safety equipment is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The bosun's safety harness hook was not designed to be secured in the manner that it was, and the practice of hooking a lanyard back onto itself is not recommended unless the lanyard and hook have been specifically designed for that purpose (4.2.4). The report indicates that "the bosun was seen to be in the process of moving the position of his safety harness lanyard hook when he lost his balance and fell" (4.2.3), and "the practice of hooking a lanyard back onto itself is not recommended" (4.2.4). This misuse of equipment was a direct factor in the accident.

Inadequate Equipment and Lack of Anchor Points
The inadequacy of the equipment provided and the lack of proper anchor points for fall prevention are safety themes relevant to this accident. The bosun had to secure his lanyard to a luffing wire due to the absence of designated fall-prevention anchor points on the cranes (4.2.3). The hooks on the harnesses provided on board were not suitable for looping around an attachment point and back onto the lanyard (4.3.6). This lack of proper equipment and anchor points contributed to the inability to secure the safety harness properly, leading to the accident.

Decision-Making and Planning Deficiencies
Decision-making and planning deficiencies are evident in the decision to change the crane wire while the vessel was on passage, which introduced unnecessary risks. The crew's decision to replace the hoisting wire on number 2 crane during the passage from Bluff to Marsden Point, using a damaged wire that had been removed from another crane, was questionable and indicative of poor planning (4.4.2-4.4.4). The report states that "the decision was made to change the hoisting wire on number 2 crane while the vessel was on passage" (4.4.2), and "it is of concern that the crew were considering placing a used wire that had previously been considered not fit for purpose onto a crane" (4.4.4). This decision-making process did not adequately consider the safety implications of such actions.
Themes for 2010_003: 
Unapproved Maintenance Practices
Unapproved maintenance practices are a significant safety theme as they directly impact the reliability and performance of critical aircraft components. In this accident, the fuel-transfer tubes were cleaned in a milling solution, which was not an approved method by the manufacturer. This improper cleaning process "had the effect of removing the anodised coating and shrinking the overall dimensions of the tubes" (4.2), leading to the o-rings not providing a snug fit and eventually deteriorating, causing a fuel leak. This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of adhering to approved maintenance procedures to ensure the integrity of aircraft parts.

Inadequate Emergency Response
Inadequate emergency response is another safety theme that emerged from this accident. The pilots identified reduced engine performance and a strong smell of fuel, which are indicators of a serious issue, yet they did not make a distress call. The report suggests that "it would, therefore, have been more prudent for the pilot to make a distress call to ensure he obtained priority to land and to alert emergency services" (4.6). This theme is relevant because it underscores the need for proper communication and emergency procedures to be followed in the event of a critical in-flight situation to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.

Reluctance to Use Distress Communication
Reluctance to use distress communication is a safety theme that can have serious implications during an emergency. The report indicates that some pilots are hesitant to use terms like "Mayday" or "Pan Pan" due to a desire not to attract undue attention (4.7). This theme is relevant to the accident because it points to a potential gap in safety culture where pilots may prioritize concerns about reputation over the immediate safety needs of the situation, which could delay the response from emergency services and increase the risk to the aircraft and its occupants.

Faults in Safety Information Systems
Faults in safety information systems represent a safety theme that can lead to misclassification and underestimation of the severity of incidents. In this case, the occurrence was incorrectly classified as "minor" due to a latent fault in the system, which meant that "the Commission was not automatically and immediately notified" (4.8). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates how systemic issues in reporting and classification can hinder the timely and appropriate response to safety incidents, potentially allowing similar issues to go unaddressed.

Use of Non-Specific Parts
The use of non-specific parts in critical aircraft systems is a safety theme that can compromise the performance and safety of the aircraft. Although the o-rings used in this incident were "generic items fit for use" (5.3), the interaction with the out-of-specification fuel-transfer tubes led to a fuel leak. This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of ensuring that all parts used in an aircraft, even if they are deemed fit for use, are compatible with the specific requirements of the aircraft's systems to prevent malfunctions.

Lack of Traceability in Maintenance History
Lack of traceability in maintenance history is a safety theme that can obscure the origins of faulty maintenance practices and hinder corrective actions. In this incident, despite a review of maintenance records and inquiries, "the facility where the tubes had been removed and cleaned in a non-approved manner could not be identified" (4.2). This theme is relevant because it highlights the challenges in tracking the maintenance history of aircraft parts, which is crucial for identifying and rectifying unsafe practices and preventing recurrence of similar incidents.
Themes for 2019_102: 
Speed Management
Speed management is a critical safety theme as it involves the control of train velocity to ensure it remains within safe operational limits. In the case of this accident, excessive speed was identified as a contributory factor to the derailment. The train "reached 31 km/h when it was allowed to coast" (3.6) and "the speed of the train had risen to 37 km/h" (3.9) which was "9 km/h or 36% over the maximum permissible line speed at the crossing loop" (3.10). This indicates that the train was traveling significantly faster than the designated safe speed, which contributed to the dynamic interaction that led to the derailment (3.11).

Driver Distraction
Driver distraction is a safety theme that refers to the loss of attention to critical tasks due to non-driving activities, which can lead to accidents. In this incident, the driver's attention was diverted from controlling the train's speed to reading route paperwork (3.12). This distraction occurred during a "critical time when it was essential to control the train speed on a downhill gradient through low speed points" (3.12), which allowed the train to accelerate beyond the safe speed limit, contributing to the derailment.

Track Condition
Track condition is a safety theme that encompasses the physical state of the railway infrastructure, which can influence the risk of derailments. Although the track twist was within KiwiRail's tolerance limits (3.14), it was still considered a contributory factor to the derailment due to dynamic interaction (3.15). The track twist likely started a rocking motion of the wagons, which, when combined with other factors such as speed and the wagons' high center of gravity, contributed to the derailment (3.15).

Wagon Loading and Center of Gravity
Wagon loading and center of gravity is a safety theme that involves the distribution of cargo within a wagon and its effect on the wagon's stability. The investigation found that the "relatively high center of gravity of the loaded coal wagons" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) was a factor that contributed to the derailment. Although the loading was within permissible limits, the high center of gravity made the wagons more susceptible to destabilizing forces, such as those experienced during dynamic interaction (3.19).

Organizational Practices
Organizational practices encompass the policies, procedures, and decision-making processes within an organization that can impact safety. In this case, a suggestion from the operations department to prevent heavier trains from using the crossing loop was not adopted (3.33). This decision allowed the existing system to continue, which contributed to the circumstances leading to the derailment. KiwiRail has since implemented the suggestion to improve safety (3.34).

Equipment Performance
Equipment performance relates to the functioning and reliability of the hardware used in operations, such as wagons and bogies. The wagons and bogies involved in the accident were overrepresented in KiwiRail's derailment statistics (3.29-3.30). However, the investigation did not find evidence that the equipment contributed to the accident (3.31). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining equipment to ensure it does not pose a safety risk, even though in this instance, it was not a contributing factor to the derailment.
Themes for 2013_005: 
Recognition and Recovery from Un-commanded Rolls
The theme of recognizing and recovering from un-commanded rolls is central to this accident, as the instructional flight was specifically meant to review "the recognition of and recovery from an un-commanded right roll" (4.1.1). The instructor was experienced and had carried out the exercise safely many times before, but during the accident flight, the very event they were meant to avoid occurred (4.1.1). The instructor's failure to follow the recommended procedure for an un-commanded roll that he was about to review with the student is highlighted as a reason for the inquiry (4.1.4). This theme is relevant because it directly relates to the accident's occurrence and the instructor's deviation from standard recovery procedures.

Mast Bumping Hazard
Mast bumping is a significant safety theme in this accident, as the "extreme attitudes reached by the helicopter during the event presented a great risk of a substantial mast bump" (4.1.2). The rotor head damage confirmed that a mast bump did occur (4.1.2). The risk of mast bumping is not confined to Robinson helicopters but is more likely with helicopters that have two-bladed underslung main rotors, such as the R22 involved in this accident (4.3.1). The potential for mast bumping to be catastrophic makes it a critical safety theme.

Low-G Condition Inducement
The inadvertent inducement of a low-G condition is a key safety theme, as the accident's probable cause was "an inadvertent reduction in G during the transition from the flap-forward demonstration to the next exercise" (5.2). The instructor and student's differing recollections of the G-force before the roll and the instructor's higher-than-recommended power setting likely contributed to the high rate of roll if there was a coincident reduction in G (4.2.2, 4.2.4). This theme is relevant because it addresses the flight conditions that likely led to the un-commanded roll.

Special Training Content and Conduct
The content and conduct of special training for Robinson helicopter pilots is a safety theme, as the number of accidents had not decreased as expected following the introduction of special training, and all pilots involved in recorded accidents had received this training (4.1.4). The accident underlines the urgency for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to take effective action regarding the content or conduct of the special training (4.3.8). This theme is relevant because it suggests that the current training may not be effectively mitigating the risks associated with flying Robinson helicopters.

Flight Manual Clarity and Emphasis
The clarity and emphasis of critical safety information in the flight manual is a safety theme, as the Robinson helicopter flight manuals do not conform to the aviation industry practice for the use of "Warnings" to emphasize flight conditions and operating practices that can cause death or serious injury (4.4). The Commission recommended that the FAA require Robinson to amend its flight manuals to include the use of "Warning" for those operating conditions and practices that involve a risk of personal injury or loss of life (4.4.10). This theme is relevant because it addresses how the presentation of safety information can affect pilot understanding and behavior.

Contradictory Regulatory Requirements
Contradictory regulatory requirements are a safety theme, as there is an apparent contradiction between the Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73, which requires dual flight instruction in the effects of low-G maneuvering, and the R22 helicopter flight manual, which prohibits the demonstration of low-G conditions (5.3). This contradiction could lead to confusion among pilots and instructors about the proper training procedures, making it a relevant safety theme for this accident.
Themes for 2018_005: 
FADEC System Malfunction and Pilot Response
The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system malfunction is a central safety theme in this accident. The FADEC system experienced an intermittent fault that resulted in a loss of automatic governing of the engine power ("An intermittent fault in the 'full authority digital engine control' (FADEC) system almost certainly resulted in a loss of automatic governing of the engine power" (4.1)). The pilot did not switch the FADEC system to manual mode, which could have allowed for control of the engine power during the forced landing ("The pilot did not switch the FADEC system to manual mode" (4.3)). This theme is relevant because the malfunction of the FADEC system and the pilot's subsequent actions directly contributed to the inability to control the engine power, leading to a heavy landing and severe injuries to the occupants.

Training and Knowledge of Emergency Procedures
The theme of training and knowledge of emergency procedures is highlighted by the pilot's lack of understanding of the FADEC system and the prescribed responses to various malfunctions. The pilot expressed reluctance to use the manual mode in flight and could not describe its operation correctly ("The pilot expressed a reluctance to use the manual mode in flight and could not describe its operation correctly" (3.59)). Additionally, the pilot's written examination for the MD 600N type rating did not mention the correct actions required involving the auto/manual switch or the use of manual throttle control in the specified situation ("The pilot's written answer had made no mention of the correct actions required involving the auto/manual switch or the use of manual throttle control in the specified situation" (3.61)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that the pilot's training may not have adequately prepared them to handle the FADEC system malfunction, which was a contributing factor in the accident.

Availability of Training Resources
The availability of training resources is a safety theme related to this accident. The helicopter manufacturer did not provide information to assist instructors in training for flying in manual mode, which is a proprietary procedure not available outside the manufacturer's own training organization ("the helicopter manufacturer did not provide information to assist instructors in training for flying in manual mode" (3.70)). This lack of available training resources may have contributed to the pilot's reluctance to use manual mode and the misunderstanding of when its use would be appropriate, which is significant given the role of the FADEC system malfunction in the accident.

Use of Helmets
The use of helmets is a safety theme that, while not directly contributing to the accident, is related to the severity of the injuries sustained by the occupants. Neither the pilot nor any of the occupants were wearing helmets during the accident flight, and there was no Civil Aviation Rule to mandate the wearing of helmets ("Neither the pilot nor any of the occupants were wearing helmets on the accident flight" (3.82)). Research has documented the benefits of wearing helmets on board helicopters to prevent head injuries, especially for pilots during occurrence events when they need to maintain awareness and act quickly ("A significant amount of research exists on the benefits of aircraft occupants wearing appropriate helmets" (3.84)). This theme is relevant as it addresses the potential for mitigating injury severity in accidents.

Pilot's Experience with Non-FADEC Engine Variants
The pilot's experience with non-FADEC engine variants is a safety theme that may have influenced their response to the FADEC system malfunction. The pilot had significantly more experience flying other light helicopters powered by non-FADEC variants of the RR-250 engine and reduced the throttle on the collective twistgrip during the accident flight, which was the prescribed procedure for a fuel control system malfunction resulting in a high rotor RPM with the non-FADEC RR-250 engine variants ("The pilot of the accident flight had significantly more experience in flying other light helicopters powered by non-FADEC variants of the RR-250 engine" (3.65)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that the pilot's prior experience may have affected their decision-making during the emergency, potentially leading to actions that were not appropriate for the FADEC-equipped helicopter involved in the accident.

Inattentional Blindness and Pilot Workload
Inattentional blindness and pilot workload is a safety theme that considers the pilot's mental state and situational awareness during the accident. Studies have identified that during times of high mental workload, cognitive resources can fail to register information that is not subconsciously deemed a priority ("studies on the topic of inattentional blindness have identified that during times of high mental workload, cognitive resources can reach a saturation point and fail to register information that is not subconsciously deemed a priority" (3.47 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Although the reversionary governor took control during a phase of flight coinciding with a comparatively low mental-workload requirement, it is unclear if the pilot suffered from inattentional blindness or if the caution and warning lights had illuminated ("On the accident flight the reversionary governor took control during a phase of flight coinciding with a comparatively low mental-workload requirement" (3.48)). This theme is relevant as it explores the human factors that may have affected the pilot's ability to respond effectively to the emergency.
Themes for 2019_108: 
Inadequate Traffic Management Plan (TMP)
The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing, which is a significant safety theme as it directly relates to the planning and management of the roadwork activity. The TMP approved by the contractor did not include the rail corridor and crossing within the work area, contrary to Waka Kotahi's own guidelines that state "any traffic management plan must consider implications of the work and associated controls on the safe operation of each corridor" ("safety issue: the tmp did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.9 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This oversight in the TMP meant that no added protection was put in place for the crossing during the roadwork activity, increasing the risk to road and rail vehicles ("Safety issue: The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.10-3.12)).

Lack of Permit to Work within Rail Corridor
Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without obtaining a permit, which is a critical safety theme as it bypasses the necessary risk-mitigation actions required prior to the commencement of such work. The absence of a Permit to Enter (PTE) meant that the contractor did not complete the series of checks to ensure no unacceptable risk to KiwiRail assets and users of the rail corridor ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.14-3.17)). This lack of oversight meant that KiwiRail could not consider necessary risk-mitigation actions, such as temporarily lowering the speed of trains through the crossing or promulgating the work site on the daily information bulletin ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.22-3.23)).

Miscommunication and Protocol Deviation
The miscommunication between the contractor and the National Corridor Permit Manager, as well as the deviation from the correct protocol for extending a PTE, highlights a safety theme related to communication and adherence to established procedures. The contractor's request to extend an existing PTE for a different location did not follow the correct protocol, and after a period of correspondence, communication ceased without a PTE being issued for the crossing ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.16-3.17)). This breakdown in communication and protocol adherence contributed to the lack of proper oversight and risk mitigation for the work being conducted near the rail corridor.

Insufficient Consideration of Crossing Risks
The TMP's insufficient consideration of the risks posed by the crossing is a safety theme that reflects a lack of comprehensive risk assessment in the planning phase. KiwiRail may have deduced from the TMP that there had been an insufficient consideration of the risks posed by the crossing if they had been given the opportunity to review the planned work ("safety issue: work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.23 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant because it indicates a systemic issue where the potential dangers associated with the level crossing were not adequately addressed in the TMP, leading to increased risks during the roadwork activity.

Inadequate Protection for Road and Rail Vehicles
The lack of specific protection for the crossing within the work area is a safety theme that underscores the failure to implement additional safety measures during roadwork activities. Vehicles were signaled through the roadworks area towards the crossing without specific protection being put in place to ensure that road users would comply with crossing alarm warning devices as they normally would ("safety issue: the tmp did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it highlights the absence of proactive safety measures to protect both road and rail vehicles at the crossing during the upgrade works.

Contractor's Responsibility and Oversight
The current process placing the onus on contractors to apply for PTEs after TMPs have been approved is a safety theme related to the responsibility and oversight of contractors. This process increases the risk of work going ahead without rail access providers' knowledge or approval, as evidenced by the fact that rail access providers can only provide additional protections if they are aware in advance of the work taking place ("safety issue: work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.26 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant because it points to a gap in the system where contractors may proceed with work without the necessary permits and oversight, potentially compromising safety.
Themes for 2013_009: 
Crew Resource Management
Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a safety theme that involves the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, equipment, and information, to achieve safe and efficient flight operations. In the context of this accident, CRM was a critical factor that enabled the crew to perform as a cohesive unit and make a safe landing in demanding circumstances. The report states, "The incident was a good demonstration of effective crew resource management that enabled a safe landing to be made in demanding circumstances" (4.4.7). This highlights the importance of CRM in managing the unexpected whiteout conditions during the landing at Pegasus Field.

Weather Forecasting and Information Accuracy
Weather forecasting and information accuracy is a safety theme that pertains to the reliability and timeliness of weather data provided to flight crews, which is crucial for safe flight operations, especially in challenging environments like Antarctica. The report indicates that "the forecast sent to the crew of the aeroplane before they reached the PSR was derived from a range of data sources and followed careful analysis by experienced forecasters" (4.1.3), but the expected weather clearance did not occur, leading to near-whiteout conditions. Additionally, there were issues with the timely delivery of weather reports, as "the absence of the 1225 special weather report and the delay in sending the 1332 special weather report, while unlikely to have altered the outcome, need to be examined further to ensure that safety-critical information is passed to crews in a timely manner" (4.3.8).

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management is a safety theme that involves identifying potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate risks. In this incident, the risk assessment process for using the Boeing 757 for Antarctic operations was called into question. The report suggests that "there was a low likelihood of the weather conditions at pegasus field aerodrome deteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return. however, the potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the boeing 757 aircraft, because of the lack of alternative approach procedures and aerodromes suitable for this aircraft type" (4.5.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This indicates that the original risk assessment may not have fully accounted for the specific challenges and potential consequences associated with the Boeing 757 operations in Antarctica.

Instrument Approach Procedures and Calibration
Instrument approach procedures and their calibration are critical for ensuring that aircraft can land safely, especially in poor visibility conditions. The report discusses the importance of validating and calibrating instrument approaches, particularly at the beginning of the Antarctic summer season. It was noted that "the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated with caution prior to calibration flights being conducted early in the summer season" (4.5.9 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The incident revealed that the instrument approach track was offset from the runway centerline, which increased the risk of operations (4.2.3, 4.2.4). This theme is relevant to the accident as it highlights the need for accurate approach procedures to ensure the safety of aircraft during landing, especially in challenging environments.

Alternative Landing Options and Diversion Planning
Alternative landing options and diversion planning are safety themes that involve having contingency plans and options available in case the intended landing site becomes unsuitable. The report points out that "compared with the Hercules, the Boeing 757 had limited alternative approach options or aerodromes available in the event of the weather suddenly deteriorating below instrument approach minima" (4.5.4). This lack of alternatives placed the Boeing 757 in a precarious situation when the weather deteriorated, underscoring the importance of having viable diversion options as part of the flight planning process.

Training and Preparedness for Adverse Conditions
Training and preparedness for adverse conditions is a safety theme that focuses on ensuring that flight crews are adequately trained and prepared for unexpected or challenging situations. In this incident, the crew's training and preparedness were highlighted as factors that contributed to the safe outcome. The report mentions that "The crew of the aeroplane undertook the normal pre-deployment training, which included learning about Antarctic weather and flight planning considerations" (4.2.1) and that "The captain had practised the whiteout landing technique in a simulator" (4.2.1). This theme is relevant to the accident as it demonstrates the importance of comprehensive training in enabling crews to handle emergencies effectively.
Themes for 2018_102: 
Procedural Adherence
Procedural adherence is a safety theme that involves the strict following of established protocols and procedures to ensure safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because there were multiple instances where procedures were not correctly followed. For example, "the correct procedures for protecting the rail vehicles stabled in the loop had not been followed by the work group" (3.27), and "the train controller on duty at the time did not confirm the status of the points with them and did not mark the status of the points on the train control diagram" (3.14). These procedural failures contributed to the incident, highlighting the importance of procedural adherence for safety.

Communication and Information Flow
Communication and information flow is a safety theme that focuses on the accurate and timely exchange of critical information among all parties involved in operations. This theme is significant in the context of the accident because there were failures in communication that contributed to the incident. For instance, "the train controller did not confirm the status of the points with the workgroup team leader" (3.15), and "the conversation the train driver overheard between the workgroup and train control contained incorrect information, which was later repeated by train control directly to the train driver" (3.21). These communication breakdowns led to incorrect assumptions and actions, underscoring the need for clear and reliable communication in rail operations.

Verification and Cross-Checking
Verification and cross-checking is a safety theme that involves confirming the accuracy of critical information or actions, often through independent means. This theme is relevant to the accident as there was a lack of independent verification to ensure that safety procedures were correctly implemented. The report states, "there was no independent verification to confirm that the required protection had been put in place" (4.1), and "the fact that nobody else was cross-checking such an important task is a failure in itself" (3.18). The absence of verification processes allowed errors to go undetected and contributed to the incident.

Human Factors and Error Management
Human factors and error management is a safety theme that addresses the understanding and mitigation of human errors in operational environments. This theme is pertinent to the accident due to the human errors that occurred and were not adequately managed. The report mentions a "lapse" which was "a failure in the first procedure designed to protect the stabled vehicles from collision" (3.18), and the train driver's "confirmation bias" which led to the decision to not stop at the Red light (3.24). These human errors were critical in the sequence of events leading to the accident, highlighting the need for systems that account for and mitigate human error.

Non-Technical Skills
Non-technical skills refer to the cognitive, social, and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance. This safety theme is relevant to the accident as the report identifies opportunities where the application of non-technical skills could have prevented the incident. It is stated that "there were several examples in the incident sequence where better communication and the practice of good non-technical skills could have detected one or more of the errors made and prevented the incident" (3.31). The lack of non-technical skills such as situational awareness and decision-making played a role in the accident.

Safety Culture and Leadership
Safety culture and leadership is a safety theme that involves the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. Leadership plays a crucial role in fostering a positive safety culture. This theme is relevant as the incident report suggests a potential lack of leadership in ensuring safety procedures were followed. The "team leader of the workgroup had overall responsibility for ensuring that the points were correctly set and isolated" (3.7), yet this did not occur as required. The incident highlights the importance of leadership in promoting and ensuring adherence to safety practices.
Themes for 2019_104: 
Adherence to Safety Procedures
Adherence to safety procedures is a critical theme in this accident, as the failure to follow established rules significantly increased the risk of a collision. The report highlights that the rail protection officer (RPO) likely instructed site protectors not to lock off personnel, which is a direct violation of Rule 902 - Managing Multiple Worksites. This rule requires all personnel to return to a designated safe place and lock off before a rail movement is authorized through the worksite ("By incorrectly applying Rule 902, a key safety defence for protecting workers was removed" (3.5)). The RPO's misunderstanding of the work train's intended route and the subsequent incorrect instructions to the site protectors led to a situation where workers were not afforded the protection they should have been under the rule ("the rail protection officer very likely instructed the site protectors to not lock off workgroups, nor require workers to return to a safe place for a rail movement, which contrasted with the requirements of Rule 902" (4.2)).

Effective Communication
Effective communication is another safety theme that played a significant role in this incident. The report indicates that there was a reliance on radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision due to the RPO's decision not to request an additional site protector ("without everyone returning to the designated safe area with the responsible site protector and locking off, it relied on effective radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision" (3.7)). However, the southern site protector misidentified a radio call, believing that workgroup 4 was clear of the track, which led to the authorization of the work train through the worksite while the track was still occupied ("The southern site protector misidentified a radio call, believing that workgroup 4 was clear of the track" (4.4)). This miscommunication was exacerbated by the lack of unique identifiers or call signs for each communicator, which likely resulted in confusion and the misidentification of radio calls ("On this occasion, only the site protectors had allocated call signs, which likely resulted in confusion when workgroups were communicating on the radio" (3.18)).

Non-Technical Skills
Non-technical skills, such as challenge and response, are crucial for ensuring safety, especially when questionable instructions are given. In this incident, the southern site protector initially challenged the RPO's instruction not to lock off track workers, but reluctantly agreed due to the authority gradient and their relative inexperience ("The site protector, who reported to the RPO, was relatively new to the role and less experienced than the RPO" (3.9)). Moreover, other experienced personnel present at the pre-shift briefing did not support the challenge, which could have rectified the unsafe instruction ("None of them challenged the RPO's instruction or supported the southern site protector's challenge" (3.10)). The importance of non-technical skills in preventing incidents has been highlighted in previous Commission reports, and the NZ Transport Agency has been working on developing these skills throughout KiwiRail's workforce ("The NZ Transport Agency has updated the Commission on the status of completed and ongoing work being undertaken by KiwiRail in developing non-technical skills throughout its workforce" (3.12)).

Clarity of Operating Rules
The clarity of operating rules is a significant safety theme, as ambiguity in the rules can lead to misinterpretation and unsafe practices. The New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures did not provide clear guidance on managing work trains within a worksite, which led to the development of locally adopted procedures that had not been formally assessed or approved ("It was likely that the lack of documented procedures for the protection of workers when a work train was carrying out work had led to the development of locally adopted procedures" (3.21)). The rules were open to interpretation and modification at a local level, which contributed to the incident ("As a result, the rule was open to interpretation and modification at a local level" (3.23)). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail review Rule 902 to ensure that procedures for the operation of work trains in Protected Work Areas (PWAs) are appropriate and provide suitable levels of protection for track workers ("The Commission has made a recommendation to KiwiRail to review Rule 902 in light of this incident" (3.24)).

Resource Management
Resource management, particularly the allocation and use of site protectors, is a theme that impacted the safety of the operation. The RPO reassigned one of the original site protectors to act as the pilot for the work train, leaving only two site protectors responsible for two workgroups within each worksite ("the rpo decided it was unnecessary to request an additional site protector, meaning the two remaining site protectors would be responsible for the two workgroups within each worksite" (3.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This decision increased the reliance on radio communication and reduced the effectiveness of visual oversight, which is a critical safety measure ("This was permissible, but without everyone returning to the designated safe area with the responsible site protector and locking off, it relied on effective radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision" (3.7)). The RPO had alternative options available to ensure that each of the geographically isolated workgroups were within sight of a site protector, which would have likely reduced the risk of miscommunication and increased safety ("the RPO had alternative options available to ensure that each of the geographically isolated workgroups were within sight of a site protector" (3.8)).

Response to Safety Challenges
The response to safety challenges is a theme that reflects the organizational culture and the willingness of individuals to adhere to safety protocols. In this case, the southern site protector's initial challenge to the RPO's unsafe instruction was not effectively supported by other experienced personnel, which could have prevented the unsafe practice from being carried out ("The southern site protector recalled reluctantly agreeing not to 'lock off' personnel after initially challenging the instruction" (3.9)). The lack of support for the challenge and the failure to rectify the unsafe instruction indicate a need for a stronger safety culture where individuals feel empowered to speak up and are supported when they do so ("Had they done so effectively, the unsafe instruction may have been rectified" (3.10)). This theme is closely related to the development of non-technical skills and the importance of fostering an environment where safety is prioritized and challenges to unsafe practices are taken seriously.
Themes for 2017_205: 
Inadequate Safety Management Systems
The operator's safety management system failed to fully mitigate the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, despite a previous incident under similar circumstances. This indicates a systemic issue in identifying and addressing potential fire hazards. "The operator's safety management system had not fully mitigated the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar circumstances" (4.2). Furthermore, the operator had not included the risk of fire caused by hot cargo lamps in its fleet safety management system, which demonstrates a lack of comprehensive risk assessment and management within the organization (4.2.11).

Emergency Response Preparedness
The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties, which could lead to confusion and inefficiency during emergency situations. "The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties" (4.3). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of clear and well-understood emergency response plans, which are crucial for effective incident management (4.3.1-4.3.16).

Firefighting Techniques and Training
The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires, which suggests a gap in the preparedness of shore-based firefighting personnel when dealing with maritime incidents. "The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires" (4.4). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for specialized training and knowledge for effectively combating fires on ships, which have unique firefighting challenges compared to land-based structures (4.4.1-4.4.7).

Risk of Incandescent Lighting
The use of high-powered incandescent reflector lamps in ships' cargo holds was identified as a significant fire hazard. The accident investigation confirmed that the cargo lamp produced sufficient heat to ignite the timber cargo, leading to the fire. "The burn pattern on the timber cargo adjacent to the cargo hold light was a strong indication that the heat generated by the reflector lamp was the cause of the fire" (4.2.1). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for safer lighting alternatives in ship design and operation to prevent similar incidents (4.2.7).

Procedural Compliance and Documentation
The absence of written procedures or checklists for ensuring cargo hold lights were switched off before loading flammable cargo or when loading was complete indicates a lack of procedural compliance and documentation. "The ship had no written procedure or checklist for ensuring the cargo hold lights were switched off before flammable cargo was loaded against cargo light recesses, or when loading was complete and hatch lids were closed" (5.2). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of having clear, documented procedures to prevent human error and ensure safety measures are consistently applied (4.2.9).

Coordination Among Responding Agencies
The need for a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies, was evident. "However, it is important that there be a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies" (4.3.12). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of coordination and communication among different agencies during emergency responses to ensure an effective and unified approach (4.3.9, 4.3.13).
Themes for 2016_102: 
Non-adherence to Operating Procedures
Non-adherence to operating procedures is a safety theme that is highly relevant to this accident. The report indicates that the train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedure as described in Operating Rule 124(d) for undertaking the setback movement for the coal train, which was a contributing factor in the incident ("The train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedure as described in Operating Rule 124(d) for undertaking the setback movement for the coal train. His not doing so was a contributing factor in the incident" (5.3)). Additionally, the train controller, the train driver, and the pilot did not share the same concept of the plan for recovering the stalled train, leading to errors and erroneous assumptions that contributed to the incident ("Consequently, a number of errors and erroneous assumptions that contributed to the incident went unchallenged" (5.6)).

Inadequate Communication and Training
Inadequate communication and training is another safety theme related to this accident. The report highlights that neither the train controller, the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124(d), which had replaced the withdrawn local procedure for setting trains back at Paerata ("Neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124(d)" (4.3.22)). This lack of familiarity suggests that the change in procedures was not effectively communicated or that staff were not adequately trained on the new rule, which is a safety issue because it involves a change to a long-established procedure with implications for transport safety ("It is generally not sufficient to make a change, broadcast it by way of a Bulletin, and then assume that all staff will have read and fully understood what is required" (4.3.23)).

Deficient Risk Management
Deficient risk management is a safety theme that emerges from the report, as it was found that the system of change management at KiwiRail was not effective in communicating to staff a change in procedures for setting back trains at Paerata and ensuring that the change was fully implemented ("The KiwiRail system of change management was not effective in communicating to staff a change in procedures for setting back trains at Paerata and ensuring that the change was fully implemented" (5.5)). This indicates a broader issue with how the organization manages and mitigates risks associated with procedural changes.

Lack of Shared Understanding Among Crew
A lack of shared understanding among the crew is a safety theme identified in the report. The train controller, train driver, and pilot did not have a shared understanding of the procedure that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority, which contributed to the incident ("the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the procedure that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). This lack of shared understanding led to miscommunication and incorrect assumptions during the recovery operation.

Inadequate Post-Incident Procedures
Inadequate post-incident procedures are highlighted as a safety theme in the report. Specifically, the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test as required by KiwiRail's procedures ("the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test" (4.5)). This omission suggests a failure to adhere to established post-incident protocols, which are designed to ensure safety and accountability.

Insufficient Non-Technical Skills Training
Insufficient non-technical skills training is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The report discusses the importance of non-technical skills, such as situational awareness, communication, and decision-making, for safe and efficient task performance in safety-critical roles ("The Rail Safety and Standards Board of Great Britain define non-technical skills as, 'the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance'" (4.4.1)). The lack of non-technical skills training for the train controller, train driver, and pilot may have contributed to the incident, as evidenced by the errors and miscommunications that occurred during the recovery operation.
Themes for 2020_002: 
Flight Path and Glider Positioning
The choice of flight path over Mount Tauhara and the execution of the flight path were significant contributing factors to the accident. The glider's position relative to the mountain, at a very low altitude and downwind of the trig station, reduced the options available to the instructor and increased the risk of an accident occurring. "The significant contributing factor to the accident was the choice of flight path over Mount Tauhara and the execution of it" (3.37). Additionally, flying just downwind of the ridge face in the poor lift zone exposed the glider to disturbed airflow and possibly turbulence, which very likely contributed to the glider's impact with the terrain (3.21).

Airworthiness and Maintenance
The airworthiness of the glider was a safety theme, as it was very likely that the glider was airworthy on the day of the accident flight and immediately before its impact with the mountain (3.10). However, the aircraft logbook showed that all checks and maintenance had been completed as required when due, except for the avionics inspection, which had expired the day before the accident (3.8). Although the overdue avionics inspection would not have affected the safety of the flight, it is still relevant to consider maintenance and airworthiness as a safety theme in aviation accidents.

Weight and Balance
The weight and balance of the glider were within acceptable limits at the time of the accident, which is a critical safety theme in aviation to ensure the aircraft operates within its certified weight and balance limits. "The glider weight and balance were very likely within the acceptable weight and balance limits at the time of the accident" (3.12). Proper weight and balance are essential for the safe operation of any aircraft, including gliders.

Pilot Medical Fitness
Medical fitness of the pilot is a safety theme, as the instructor had a current medical certificate to operate as both a gliding instructor and a tow pilot. The autopsy report found evidence of hypertensive disease, but there was no evidence to suggest pilot incapacitation (3.13). "It is very unlikely that medical factors contributed to this accident" (3.14). Ensuring the medical fitness of pilots is crucial for safe flight operations.

Instructor Training and Competency
Instructor training and competency were identified as safety issues, as the club did not ensure that Gliding New Zealand (GNZ) instructor training procedures were fully implemented, and GNZ audits did not detect this discrepancy. "The standard set by GNZ for instructor training and their continued competency was not followed by the club" (4.6). The accident instructor did not have a current competency review and had not flown with someone authorized to carry out a competency review in the 24 months prior to the accident (3.45). This theme is relevant because the instructor's ability to safely conduct the two trial flights over the mountain was in question due to the lack of formal training and verification of competency (3.36).

Situational Awareness and Speed Control
Situational awareness and speed control are safety themes, as pilots must maintain awareness of their relative positions over ridges and be alert to areas of high risk. The instructor on the first flight allowed the glider's airspeed to drop below the club's minimum safe speed near the ridge (3.27). "regardless, if an instructor's situational awareness is compromised, either by their not perceiving subtle cues that the margins are reducing, or by their not fully comprehending how the glider's current position would affect its future dynamics, recovery from the situation would become increasingly difficult" (3.23 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The ability to control airspeed and maintain situational awareness is critical for avoiding accidents, especially when flying near terrain.
Themes for 2014_002: 
Fuel Management
Fuel management is a critical aspect of aircraft operation, ensuring that engines receive a continuous supply of fuel. In this accident, the engines lost power due to fuel starvation, which occurred because "the pilot did not switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines" (5.1). The pilot's omission was likely due to his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter, as he had "almost exclusively flown the AS350 helicopter type leading up to the incident flight" (4.2.3). The AS350 has a simpler fuel system, which may have led to the pilot inadvertently applying the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350 to the BK117 (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because proper fuel management could have prevented the engines from losing power and the subsequent incident.

Pilot Training and Currency
Pilot training and currency are essential for ensuring that pilots are proficient in operating the specific aircraft types they fly. In this case, the pilot "had not been assessed for his type-specific knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 in the previous five years" (5.2), and he "lacked recent experience on the aircraft type" (5.2). The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that this pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117 (5.3). This theme is relevant because the pilot's lack of recent experience and training on the BK117 contributed to the incorrect fuel system management that led to the incident.

Use of Checklists
The use of checklists is a standard safety practice in aviation to ensure that all necessary procedures are followed. In this incident, the pilot did not use the starting-engine checklist, which would have prompted him to "switch off the fuel prime pumps and switch on the fuel transfer pumps after engine start" (4.2.7). The operator did not require pilots to refer to written checklists if they lacked recent experience on an aircraft type (5.6). This theme is relevant because adherence to the checklist could have captured the pilot's omission and prevented the helicopter from taking off with the fuel transfer pumps switched off, thereby preventing the fuel starvation.

Cockpit Lighting and Warning Systems
Cockpit lighting and warning systems are designed to alert pilots to potential issues that require immediate attention. In this accident, a cockpit lighting modification "adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, when the dimmer switch was on" (5.4). Additionally, the helicopter was not designed to generate an aural warning of a critically low fuel level in the supply tanks (5.5). This theme is relevant because if the caution lights had been visible and an aural warning had been present, they could have alerted the pilot to the incorrectly configured fuel system and the low fuel levels, potentially preventing the incident.

Organisational Oversight
Organisational oversight refers to the systems and processes that an operator has in place to ensure the safety and proficiency of its operations and personnel. In this case, the operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was found lacking (5.3). The shared delegation of training and competency responsibilities between three managers made it harder for the operator to ensure that all training and competency requirements were being met (4.6.4). This theme is relevant because the lack of clear delineation of duties and effective oversight contributed to the pilot not being adequately trained or current on the BK117, which was a factor in the incident.

Aircraft Design and Safety Features
Aircraft design and safety features play a significant role in preventing accidents. The design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if the fuel system was mismanaged (4.1.2). Later helicopter designs incorporated different capacities for fuel supply tanks, allowing more time for pilots to recognize and correct issues before both engines lost power (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the design of the BK117's fuel system contributed to the rapid loss of power in both engines, leaving the pilot with little time to react, which was a factor in the incident.
Themes for 2014_006: 
Low-G Mast-Bumping Susceptibility
Low-G mast-bumping is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it is a known risk factor for in-flight break-ups in helicopters with two-bladed, semi-rigid teetering rotor systems like the Robinson R44. The accident analysis indicates that the helicopter likely encountered a severe downdraught in the lee of Mt Arthur, leading to a prolonged low-G condition and a rapid right roll that was too fast for the pilot to recover from, resulting in mast-bumping and the in-flight break-up. "the helicopter very likely encountered moderate to severe turbulence and an associated severe downdraught in the lee of mt arthur, which likely created a prolonged low-g condition" (4.7.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant because it directly relates to the dynamic behavior of the helicopter's rotor system in low-G conditions and the associated risks of mast-bumping, which were central to the accident's occurrence.

Inadequate Pilot Training for Low-G Conditions
The pilot's training and instinctive reactions to low-G conditions are a significant safety theme. The report suggests that the pilot's reaction to an unexpected right roll, or unintentional movement during severe turbulence or low-G, could lead to mast-bumping. "A pilot's instinctive reaction to an unexpected right roll, or the unintentional movement of a pilot's limbs or upper body during severe turbulence or low-G, could lead to mast-bumping" (5.9). This theme is relevant because it highlights the challenges pilots face in recognizing and correctly responding to low-G conditions, which are not intuitive and require specific training that may not have been adequately emphasized or practiced due to the prohibition of in-flight low-G demonstrations.

Helicopter Performance in Turbulence
The helicopter's performance in turbulence, particularly when lightly loaded, is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The report indicates that the helicopter was more susceptible to turbulence due to being lightly loaded, which likely contributed to the severity of the low-G condition encountered. "The helicopter was lightly loaded, which would have made it more susceptible to turbulence and the effects of reduced G" (4.7.2). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of understanding how different loading conditions can affect a helicopter's behavior in turbulent air and the associated risks.

Flight Operations in Adverse Weather Conditions
Flight operations in adverse weather conditions, including strong winds and turbulence, are a safety theme in this accident. The pilot was flying in conditions that were forecasted to be strong and turbulent, which are known to increase the risk of low-G mast-bumping. "The actual wind and turbulence at the time and location of the accident were very likely to have been the same as, or stronger than, the forecast conditions" (5.4). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risks associated with flying in challenging weather conditions and the need for appropriate limitations and decision-making to avoid such risks.

Helicopter Design and Dynamic Behavior
The unique design features of the Robinson helicopter's rotor system and its dynamic behavior during low-G conditions are a safety theme. The report discusses how the Robinson rotor design, including the delta-three hinge and the location of the pitch change horn, can contribute to rapid right rolls and mast-bumping during low-G conditions. "Due to their unique main rotor design, during a prolonged or severe low-G condition Robinson helicopters can roll rapidly to the right, and likely break up before a pilot can recover" (5.8). This theme is relevant as it pertains to the inherent design characteristics of the helicopter that affect its behavior in critical flight conditions and the associated safety implications.

Safety Measures and Limitations for Inexperienced Pilots
Safety measures and limitations for inexperienced pilots, particularly regarding maximum wind speeds and flying in turbulence, are a safety theme. The report notes that if previous limitations on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots had remained in place, the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the time of the accident. "Had a previous limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots remained in place, as per that for R22 pilots, the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the time of the accident due to the forecast strong winds and turbulence" (5.6). This theme is relevant because it addresses the regulatory and operational controls that are intended to mitigate the risks inexperienced pilots face when operating in challenging conditions.
Themes for 2014_005: 
Weight and Balance Management
Weight and balance management is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the performance capabilities of an aircraft. In this accident, the helicopter was "loaded by an estimated 30 kilograms above the maximum permitted weight of 2,250 kilograms, with its longitudinal centre of gravity an estimated up to 3.0 centimetres forward of the maximum permissible limit" (5.3). This overloading and improper balance likely contributed to the helicopter operating "at or close to the performance limit for an out-ground-effect hover" (5.4), which in turn may have led to the initial sink on the landing approach as the airspeed reduced. The use of standard loading configurations that use standard passenger weights was deemed inappropriate for operations close to permissible limits (5.7), highlighting the importance of accurate weight and balance calculations in flight safety.

Helicopter Performance Understanding
Understanding the performance capabilities of the helicopter is essential for safe flight operations, especially during high-risk activities such as heli-skiing. The accident highlighted the importance of pilots' pre-flight planning to ensure that helicopters will have sufficient performance to conduct intended flights safely (4.3.48). The pilot in this accident did not estimate the total weight accurately and therefore would not have known accurately the combined effect of the total weight, the air temperature, and the pressure altitude (4.3.25). The helicopter began an uncommanded descent during the final phase of the landing, likely because it was approaching an out-of-ground-effect hover with minimal performance capability at that weight, altitude, and temperature (4.3.50).

Seatbelt Usage and Passenger Restraint
Proper use of seatbelts and passenger restraint is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. It was found that "several of the passengers' seatbelts were not securely adjusted" (5.11), which increased the likelihood of passengers being ejected from the aircraft during the accident. The investigation revealed that the lap belts for some seats were found at or near full extension, which would have given a very loose fit around the waist (4.6.8). This loose fitting of seatbelts could have contributed to the ejection of passengers from the helicopter during the crash.

Pilot Training and Competency
Pilot training and competency are crucial for ensuring that flight operations are conducted safely, particularly in specialized and high-risk operations like heli-skiing. The pilot involved in the accident was trained in accordance with the operator's training standards and was experienced in heli-ski operations (5.9). However, the Commission noted a lack of formal recording of issues relating to the pilot's performance (4.4.9), and it was suggested that it would have been good practice for the pilot to undergo a specific heli-ski assessment flight for what is acknowledged as a high-risk operation (4.4.8). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of thorough and well-documented training, especially for operations that involve additional risks.

Operational Culture within the Helicopter Sector
The operational culture within the helicopter sector is a safety theme that has broader implications beyond the individual accident. There are indications that a culture exists among some helicopter pilots in New Zealand of operating their aircraft beyond the published and placarded limits (5.10). Such a culture can adversely affect the safety performance of the helicopter sector and has the potential to contribute to accidents. This theme is relevant to the accident as it reflects on the wider practices and attitudes that can influence pilot decision-making and risk assessment.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency preparedness and response are critical for minimizing the consequences of an accident once it has occurred. In this case, the helicopter was fitted with a 406-megahertz emergency locator transmitter, which activated upon impact and alerted the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (4.6.14). The injured guide was also able to alert another helicopter pilot within minutes of the accident. The prompt alert and response likely aided in the timely rescue of the survivors. This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of having effective emergency response protocols and equipment in place, which can be crucial for the survival and recovery of accident victims.
Themes for 2014_101: 
Sighting Distances at Level Crossings
Sighting distance is a critical factor for ensuring that drivers have enough time to see an approaching train and react accordingly to avoid a collision. In this accident, the sighting distances for road users at the Te Onetea Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards set out in the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual. The report states that "the sighting distances for road users of the te onetea road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards as set out in the nz transport agency's traffic control devices manual" (4.3.8). This inadequacy in sighting distance meant that "fully compliant, long, heavy road vehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would have had insufficient time to clear the level crossing from a standing start" (5.7), which is directly relevant to the accident as it contributed to the truck becoming stuck on the tracks.

Road Profile and Vehicle Ground Clearance
The compatibility of the road profile with the ground clearance of road-legal vehicles is essential to prevent vehicles from becoming stuck on level crossings. In this incident, the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing had a profile that prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, from passing over without becoming stuck. The report highlights that "The profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck" (5.8). This theme is relevant because the truck involved in the accident grounded due to the road profile, leading to the collision with the train.

Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
Adherence to traffic control devices, such as stop signs at level crossings, is crucial for preventing accidents. In this case, the truck driver did not stop at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, which resulted in the truck becoming stuck in the path of the train. The report clearly states, "The driver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, where his trailer grounded and the truck became stuck in the path of the train" (5.4). This theme is relevant as the non-compliance with the stop sign was a key factor in the accident's occurrence.

Audibility of Train Warnings
The ability of vehicle drivers to hear train warnings, such as whistles, is a significant safety factor. In this accident, it was uncertain whether the truck driver heard the train's whistle due to the truck's windows being closed and the engine running. The report mentions that "with the truck engine running and the windows closed, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle" (4.2.9). This theme is relevant because if the truck driver had heard the whistle, it might have alerted him to the approaching train, potentially preventing the accident.

Active Protection at Level Crossings
The presence of active protection measures at level crossings, such as flashing lights and barriers, can significantly reduce the risk of collisions. However, the report indicates that "the installation of active protection at public road level crossings does not eliminate train/motor vehicle collisions at level crossings" (4.1.3). The Te Onetea Road level crossing was only protected by a passive 'STOP' sign (4.1.2), and the accident demonstrates that passive signs alone may not be sufficient to prevent collisions, making this a relevant safety theme.

Vehicle and Train Condition and Operation
The mechanical condition of the vehicles involved and the adherence to operating procedures by train drivers are important safety factors. In this incident, there were no mechanical issues with the train or the manner in which it was driven that contributed to the accident, as "the train's event recorder showed that at the time of the accident the driver was complying with operating procedures" (4.1.4). Additionally, no faults were found on the truck that could have contributed to the accident (4.1.6). This theme is relevant as it confirms that the collision was not due to mechanical failure or improper operation of the train, focusing attention on other contributing factors.
Themes for 2015_102: 
High-Voltage Cable Assembly Management
The management of the high-voltage cable assembly is a critical safety theme as it directly contributed to the accident. The cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months, but the records did not clarify if it was new or repurposed, nor did they detail the results of any tests performed to ensure its serviceability. This lack of clear documentation and testing is a significant safety issue because it means that potentially faulty or unsuitable equipment could be in use without adequate checks, as evidenced by the failure of the cable's insulation leading to an explosion and fire ("the high-voltage cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months, but the records available did not show if it was new or repurposed" (4.3), "A failure of the high-voltage cable plug insulation caused an explosion in the high-voltage cable plug and socket" (5.1)).

Fire Preparedness and Response Training
Fire preparedness and response training is a safety theme that was found lacking and inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators. The report highlights that the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire were inconsistent, which could lead to inadequate responses in emergency situations. This is relevant to the accident as the crew did not have clear procedures or guidelines for action in the event of a fire, potentially putting themselves and others at risk ("the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators" (4.1.3), "Neither the driver nor the pilot of locomotive EF30157 had received any training in the use of the fire extinguishers fitted to their locomotive or the actions to take in the event of a fire" (4.4.4)).

Fire Detection and Suppression Standards
The absence of national standards for fire detection and suppression systems on the New Zealand rail network is a significant safety theme. The report indicates that there are no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems, which means that there is no consistent approach to managing fire risks across the sector. This is relevant to the accident as the lack of such systems may have delayed the response to the fire, and a quicker response could have potentially mitigated the severity of the incident ("the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains on the New Zealand rail network" (4.5), "had fire detection been fitted and activated, a quicker response to the fire may have resulted" (4.5.3)).

Maintenance Record Keeping
Maintenance record keeping is a safety theme that reflects on the organizational practices regarding the documentation of equipment servicing and testing. The report found that KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice, as it failed to show whether the high-voltage cable assembly was new or repurposed and did not record test results. This is relevant to the accident because accurate and detailed maintenance records are essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of critical components, and the lack of such records was a contributing factor to the incident ("KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice, as the available service records did not show whether the high-voltage cable assembly that had been in service for about 10 months was fitted new or repurposed" (5.3)).

Accessibility of Safety Equipment
The accessibility of safety equipment, such as maintenance shut-off valves, is a safety theme that has direct implications for emergency response effectiveness. In the incident, the maintenance shut-off valve was inaccessible, preventing the isolation of the oil supply and contributing to the difficulty in extinguishing the fire. This highlights the importance of designing and maintaining equipment in a way that ensures it can be safely accessed and operated during emergencies ("The maintenance shut-off valve was inaccessible and the oil supply could not be isolated due to its close proximity to the seat of the fire" (4.2.6)).

Information Availability for Emergency Services
The availability of specific information for emergency services is a safety theme that affects the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response. During the incident, firefighters lost vital time as they were not familiar with the locomotive and lacked specific information regarding hazards, layout, and isolation valves. This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for readily available, locomotive-class-specific details that could expedite emergency response and potentially reduce the impact of such incidents ("When the Fire Service arrived at the scene, vital time was lost whilst the firefighters were familiarised with the locomotive" (4.4.2)).
Themes for 2015_009: 
Team Resource Management (TRM)
Team Resource Management (TRM) is a safety theme that involves the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, to optimize safety and efficiency. In the context of this accident, the standard of TRM in the Hamilton ATC tower did not match good industry practice, which contributed to the incidents. The report states that "the assessment that was being conducted of the controller affected the normal team dynamics in the control tower" (4.2.15 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and there was "a breakdown in the team approach to managing the traffic in the aerodrome circuit" (4.3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This indicates that the TRM was not effective, leading to a series of incidents due to a lack of proper teamwork and communication among the controllers.

Air Traffic Control (ATC) Assessment Process
The ATC assessment process is a safety theme that ensures air traffic controllers maintain proficiency in managing air traffic safely. In this accident, the assessment process was compromised as "the standard pre-assessment briefing was not conducted and the expectations of the team during the assessment were not explained" (4.3.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This led to tension and uncertainty within the team, which affected the controller's performance and contributed to the loss of situational awareness (4.3.8, 4.3.9).

Controller Workload and Situational Awareness
Controller workload and situational awareness are critical safety themes in air traffic management. The report highlights that the controller became overwhelmed by the circumstances, leading to a loss of situational awareness (4.2.3). The controller's workload increased due to multiple IFR training aircraft requesting circling approaches, which slowed the circuit flow (4.2.2). This excessive workload and the subsequent loss of situational awareness were primary factors in the occurrence of the incidents.

Experience Level of Aerodrome Controllers
The experience level of aerodrome controllers is a safety theme that affects the ability to manage complex traffic situations effectively. The report notes that "Airways' practice of posting a high proportion of recently qualified aerodrome controllers with limited experience to Hamilton aerodrome" had the potential to raise the risk profile of the ATC unit (4.4.4). The controller involved in the incidents had been working at the Hamilton ATC unit for about 18 months and was still relatively inexperienced (4.2.10), which may have contributed to the controller's inability to manage the traffic effectively.

Airspace Design and Traffic Flow
Airspace design and traffic flow are safety themes that involve the structuring of airspace to minimize the risk of collisions and ensure efficient traffic management. The report discusses how changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone shifted VFR traffic congestion to prominent points outside the zone, likely increasing the risk of collision in those areas (4.5.10, 4.5.11). The redesign of the zone was intended to improve safety, but it also created new hazards by concentrating VFR aircraft in a narrow height band outside the controlled zone (4.5.15).

Communication and Language Barriers
Communication and language barriers are safety themes that can significantly impact the clarity and understanding of instructions between pilots and controllers. The report identifies that some aerodrome controllers were "over-controlling" VFR traffic and providing excessive traffic information, which congested radio frequencies and caused difficulties for pilots, especially those for whom English was a second language (4.5.18, 4.5.19). This over-communication and the presence of strong accents among pilot trainees could hinder effective communication, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and incidents.
Themes for 2015_005: 
Lack of Resilience in Digital Data Network
The lack of resilience in Airways' digital data network was a critical safety theme in this incident. Resilience refers to the ability of a system to recover quickly and provide at least a basic service if some part of it fails or is disabled. The report identified that "airways' digital data network did not have the resilience necessary to support an atc service" (4.2). This was evident as the network's design vulnerabilities had not been adequately considered or tested, leading to an unexpected outage with a greater effect on the ATC system than anticipated (5.6). The network's single point of failure was exposed when a broadcast storm occurred, blocking normal communications and raw radar data traffic to and from the control center (5.1).

Inadequate Risk Management Processes
Inadequate risk management processes were a significant safety theme in this incident. The risk management process used by Airways' network engineers for planned network maintenance did not take proper account of the context of the work or whether it was appropriate to be performed in the production environment, leading to unexpected service disruptions (5.5). The engineers considered the pre-test to be low risk and proceeded without formal approval, exposing the network to a broadcast storm (4.2.3). Additionally, the network team's risk management processes were not mature, as indicated by unexpected problems during maintenance and the lack of automatic transfer to secondary paths when primary paths failed (4.3.25).

Inadequate Design and Documentation Control
Inadequate design and documentation control was a safety theme that contributed to the incident. The design process for the new digital data network did not follow Airways' policy, resulting in uncontrolled, unapproved documentation with errors and omissions, rendering it unfit for purpose (5.4). The detailed design certificate was outdated and did not reflect the system installed, with critical standards omitted or not complied with (4.3.6, 4.3.7). The network design drawings were also not approved or up to date, lacking high-level system information and end-to-end views (4.3.12).

Insufficient Training and Technical Knowledge
Insufficient training and technical knowledge among personnel was a safety theme that played a role in the incident. Airways had not trained the technical coordinators adequately to make informed decisions about the risks to service delivery of proposed maintenance on the digital data network (5.7). The technical coordinators lacked sufficient technical knowledge of the network structure and operation to assess the impact risk of network maintenance tasks on ATC (4.3.36). This lack of knowledge and skills contributed to the inability to prevent or mitigate the incident.

Organizational and Management Deficiencies
Organizational and management deficiencies were a safety theme that underpinned the incident. The team responsible for the design, procurement, installation, and commissioning of the new network did not have sufficient authority to manage significant project risks properly (5.8). The network engineering team's importance had grown, but Airways' organizational structure had not been altered to reflect this, resulting in the team being under-resourced and its approach to risk management being inadequate (4.3.41).

Regulatory Oversight Limitations
Regulatory oversight limitations were a safety theme that emerged from the incident. CAR Part 171, which defines the requirements for an ATN certificate holder, was not contemporary for regulating a modern aeronautical telecommunications system that uses technology such as digital data networks (5.9). The CAA's audit scope was limited to technology from 1992, and the CAA did not have the capability in-house to audit or review the network's performance and management (5.10, 5.11). This lack of regulatory update and expertise meant that the CAA could not effectively oversee the digital data network's design and operation.
Themes for 2013_101: 
Incomplete Coupling Connection
The incomplete coupling connection between the sixth and seventh wagons was a critical factor in the derailment. This safety theme is relevant because the investigation found that "the separation between the sixth and seventh wagons was very likely caused by an incomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected during the terminal brake test undertaken at mission bush before the train departed" (4.1.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The incomplete coupling allowed the hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train descended the gradient from Glenbrook, leading to the train parting and the subsequent collision (4.4, 5.4).

Non-Technical Skills (Crew Resource Management)
Non-technical skills, also known as crew resource management, were identified as a safety theme because the staff did not effectively use these skills to ensure that the train's air brakes were functioning correctly. The report states that "no challenge and confirm actions were taken to complete a fundamental brake test procedure" (4.5), and "there were several opportunities to break the chain of events leading to the derailment. However, non-technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource management) were not being used to good effect" (5.6). The lack of effective communication and adherence to safety protocols among the crew members contributed to the derailment.

Procedural Lapses by Rail Staff
Procedural lapses by the rail staff, including the locomotive servicing staff, train drivers, and train examiner, were a significant safety theme. The report highlights several instances where procedures were not followed correctly, such as "the electrical connection was not fitted correctly by the servicing staff" (4.2.4), and "the required pre-departure train brake test would have revealed that the train brake was not operational, but those involved omitted to perform the test when a third locomotive was attached to the train" (5.3). These lapses in following established procedures were directly related to the accident.

Incorrect Brake Handle Set-Up
The incorrect brake handle set-up in the DL-class locomotives is a safety theme because it resulted in the driver not having brake control over the coupled wagons. The report states that "driver b was able to set the brake handles incorrectly because there was no interlock capability between the two driving cabs of the dl-class locomotives" (4.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and "The train departed Glenbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating. The brakes on all of the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly" (5.1). This issue was a direct contributor to the derailment.

Fatigue and Time of Day
Fatigue and the time of day were considered as factors affecting the performance of the rail staff involved in the accident. The report suggests that "it is likely that the time of day, when cognitive performance is at its lowest due to natural circadian rhythm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the performance of those involved in setting up and checking the train" (5.7). Although there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor, the timing of the procedural lapses at 0430, a time known for reduced cognitive performance, is relevant to the accident (4.6.6, 4.6.7).

Inadequate Detection of Electrical Plug Connection Issues
The inadequate detection of electrical plug connection issues is a safety theme because the incomplete electrical connection between the locomotives went undetected and contributed to the train being declared disabled. The report notes that "the incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff" (4.3) and "the incomplete electrical connection resulted in the two locomotives only intermittently operating together" (4.3.1). This issue was the first in a chain of events that led to the derailment.
Themes for 2017_103: 
Congested Track Layout
The congested track layout within the approaches to Wellington Station is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The limited space in this area increases the risk of trains colliding, as identified in a previous report: "there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested" (4.1.2). This congestion can lead to difficulties in managing train movements and increases the potential for accidents, especially in situations where a train needs to stop unexpectedly, as was the case in this incident.

Inadequate Risk Mitigation Measures
Inadequate risk mitigation measures for the upgraded bidirectional track is another safety theme. The report points out that "a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station" (4.1.2). Specifically, when the line was upgraded to allow trains to run in both directions, the eight-meter separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not identified as a potential issue. This oversight contributed to the incident, as the train stopped in a location that misled the signalling system, indicating that the train had cleared the signal when it had not (4.2.3).

Signalling System Limitations
The limitations of the signalling system represent a safety theme in this accident. The incident was exacerbated by the signalling system's inability to accurately display the train's position to the signaller. The train stopping with its rear bogie within the eight-meter length of track between the insulated joint and Signal 39 caused the mimic panel to incorrectly show that the train had passed the signal: "Having passed over the insulated joint, the track signalling system displayed to the signaller on the mimic panel that the rear of the train had passed Signal 39, when in fact it had not" (4.2.3). This misrepresentation on the mimic screen led the signaller to believe the track ahead was clear, increasing the risk of collision.

Train Monitoring System Inaccuracies
Inaccuracies in the train monitoring system BIOS are a safety theme linked to this incident. The driver's decision to stop the train was influenced by a false indication of a brake issue: "a subsequent maintenance examination revealed no fault with the actual brake system, and an update of the train monitoring system bios resolved the high-brake-pressure reading" (4.2.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The incorrect reading from the BIOS system led to the train stopping in a problematic location, which in turn contributed to the potential collision scenario.

Driver's Response to Perceived Brake Issues
The driver's response to perceived brake issues is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. The driver correctly prioritized safety by stopping the train to check the brakes upon perceiving that they were 'dragging': "Train brakes are a safety-critical system and the driver was right to check them on departure from the platform" (4.2.2). However, the location where the train stopped due to this action inadvertently created a situation where the signalling system was misled, highlighting the need for better protocols or systems to handle such stops without compromising safety.

Insufficient Identification of Potential Issues During Upgrades
The insufficient identification of potential issues during upgrades to the rail system is a safety theme evident in this accident. When the line was upgraded to bidirectional, the separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not recognized as a potential problem: "when the line was upgraded to bidirectional, the eight-meter separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not identified as a potential issue" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This oversight suggests a gap in the risk assessment process during upgrades, which can lead to safety-critical situations as seen in this incident.
Themes for 2013_203: 
Propeller and Shaft Maintenance
Propeller and shaft maintenance is a safety theme that involves the regular inspection, repair, and upkeep of the propeller and shaft components to ensure they are in good working condition and do not pose a risk to the vessel's operation. This theme is relevant to the accident because the failure of the Aratere's starboard propeller shaft was attributed to a fatigue fracture, which was likely exacerbated by the weakened state of the tail shaft due to fretting and corrosion. The Commission found evidence of fretting between the bore of the port and starboard propeller hubs and their respective tail shafts, which "would have decreased the fatigue strength of the tail shafts, making them more susceptible to fatigue cracking due to uniaxial (bending) forces" ("Findings" 13.2). Additionally, the lack of documentation from KiwiRail meant there was no evidence that appropriate checks and balances had been in place to ensure that the new propellers were well fitted ("Findings" 13.16).


Adherence to Manufacturer's Recommendations
Adherence to manufacturer's recommendations is a safety theme that involves following the guidance and specifications provided by the equipment manufacturer to ensure the safe and proper installation and operation of components. This theme is relevant to the accident as KiwiRail did not follow the manufacturer's advice on the best way to fit the new propellers and modify the propulsion system for optimum results. Specifically, KiwiRail decided not to follow Wärtsilä's original advice to withdraw the tail shafts to modify the tail shaft bearings as a result of the lighter propellers, which led to the need to modify the propeller instead and prevented full alignment of the tail shaft ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.3). Furthermore, KiwiRail did not carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers as advised by Wärtsilä ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.4).


Documentation and Record Keeping
Documentation and record keeping is a safety theme that involves maintaining accurate and comprehensive records of maintenance, modifications, and inspections. This theme is relevant to the accident because KiwiRail was unable to provide comprehensive records from the process to fit the new propeller on the Aratere, including confirmation of the fit achieved. The lack of documentation means there is limited evidence about the quality of the final fit achieved when the starboard propeller was replaced ("Recommendations" 15.2.2). The Commission also noted the absence of records for the decision-making process to re-propeller the Aratere, the design brief, specifications and standards for the propellers, and verification that the propellers were suitable for their intended use and properly fitted ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.8).


Vibration Analysis and Propulsion System Integrity
Vibration analysis and propulsion system integrity is a safety theme that involves assessing and monitoring the vibrations within the propulsion system to identify potential issues that could lead to mechanical failures. This theme is relevant to the accident as the Commission found that the misalignment of the entire starboard propeller shaft was worse than that for the port side, which would have likely contributed to vibration within the tail shaft area. Although this factor alone should not necessarily have caused the tail shaft to fracture, it was a contributing factor when combined with the weakened state of the tail shaft ("Findings" 13.9). Additionally, KiwiRail did not carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers as advised by Wärtsilä, which could have identified the interaction between components and helped prevent the failure ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.4).


Manufacturing Tolerances and Standards Compliance
Manufacturing tolerances and standards compliance is a safety theme that involves ensuring that components are manufactured within specified tolerances and comply with current standards to guarantee their performance and safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because the Commission questioned whether the ISO standards for large-propeller manufacturing were suitable for modern, high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins. The propellers were manufactured to ISO standard 484/1-1981 Class I (high accuracy), but propeller design and manufacture have evolved since 1981, and the tolerances contained in ISO standard 484/1 may not be as relevant for modern propellers ("Analysis: ISO standards for manufacturing tolerances" 10.2.2). The Commission recommended that Standards New Zealand submit the report to the ISO Secretariat to consider whether the current standards are appropriate for modern propellers ("Recommendations" 15.2.8).


External Expertise and Oversight
External expertise and oversight is a safety theme that involves seeking and incorporating the knowledge and supervision of external experts, especially when undertaking significant modifications to critical systems. This theme is relevant to the accident as KiwiRail did not follow expert advice during the fitment operation to ensure that the propulsion system had been set up and functioning properly before the vessel re-entered service. KiwiRail's decision not to follow Wärtsilä's advice to withdraw the tail shafts and not to carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers are examples of the lack of external expertise and oversight ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.3, 11.2.4). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail ensure appropriate oversight is in place for significant modifications to vessels, including keeping comprehensive records ("Recommendations" 15.2.1).
Themes for 2017_002: 
Low Rotor RPM and Engine Performance
Low rotor RPM is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it is indicative of insufficient power being delivered by the engine to maintain the rotor blades' rotational speed under load. The report states that "the damage observed on one of the main rotor blades was consistent with the main rotor having 'coned'" and "the illumination of the Low Rotor RPM caution light was also indicative of the main rotor being at low RPM" (3.6). Furthermore, the engine's poor condition, as evidenced by "excessive carbon deposits," "exhaust valve guide wear," and "worn crankcase bearing shells," likely affected its reliability and maximum power output (3.19, 3.20). This theme is relevant because the helicopter's ability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tree canopy and perform necessary maneuvers was likely compromised by the engine's inability to deliver the required power.

Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions, such as wind and visual impairment, are a significant safety theme in this accident. The wind at the time of the accident was "light and variable, but generally it was a tailwind from the south-east," which could have reduced the helicopter's rate of climb during a critical phase of flight (3.11). Additionally, the sun was low on the horizon directly ahead of the flight track, potentially impairing the pilot's vision and ability to determine the helicopter's height above the tree canopy (3.12). These factors are relevant as they could have influenced the pilot's ability to maintain control and situational awareness during the flight, contributing to the collision with the tree canopy.

Helicopter Maintenance and Airworthiness
The maintenance and airworthiness of the helicopter are central safety themes, as the investigation revealed several maintenance issues that were not addressed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions or the Civil Aviation Rules. For instance, "a dent in the tail rotor blade had not been patched in accordance with the Robinson Helicopter Company R22 maintenance manual" and "the under surface of the main rotor blades had started to delaminate and had an unapproved repair" (3.31). Additionally, the helicopter's "main rotor blades had exceeded their 12-year finite calendar life by eight months" (3.34). These issues are relevant because they could have compromised the helicopter's structural integrity and performance, potentially contributing to the accident.

Pilot Decision-Making and Flight Path Selection
Pilot decision-making and flight path selection are crucial safety themes, as the pilot chose to fly over densely forested terrain when alternative paths with less risk were available. The report notes that "the helicopter lifted off and the pilot flew over densely forested terrain, when alternative flight paths were available that offered less risk in the event of an aircraft emergency" (4.4). This theme is relevant because the pilot's decisions regarding the flight path directly affected the outcome of the emergency situation, as the helicopter collided with the tree canopy during an attempt to recover from a low rotor RPM event.

Regulatory Compliance and Oversight
Regulatory compliance and oversight are significant safety themes, as the pilot was found to be operating outside the privileges of a private pilot and not in compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules. The report indicates that "the pilot was intending to carry the hunter for reward without holding a commercial pilot licence or operating under an air operator certificate" (3.35). Moreover, the CAA's regulatory and surveillance controls for the non-commercial aviation sector were based on the assumption that participants would be responsible for safety and comply with regulatory requirements (3.40). This theme is relevant because the lack of adherence to regulations and oversight mechanisms may have allowed unsafe practices to go undetected, potentially contributing to the accident.

Carburettor Icing Conditions
Carburettor icing conditions are a pertinent safety theme, as they presented a moderate risk at the time of the accident and could have affected engine performance. The Pilot's Operating Handbook noted the possibility of ice formation in the induction system under certain temperature and humidity conditions, which were present during the accident (3.14). Although the carburettor heating control was found in the OFF position, the carburettor's damage prevented confirmation of its status at the time of the accident (3.15). This theme is relevant because carburettor icing could have contributed to a reduction in engine power, affecting the helicopter's ability to maintain altitude and clear obstacles.
Themes for 2012_103: 
Track Maintenance and Repair Efficacy
Track maintenance and repair efficacy is a critical safety theme as it directly impacts the stability and reliability of the rail network. In the case of this accident, the system for recording and monitoring the effects of track repair and maintenance was not effective in ensuring that identified track defects were remedied. "Records showed that on 10 occasions between July 2009 and November 2011, KiwiRail's track-evaluation car had identified and reported the same pattern of track twist defects that contributed to this and the derailment six and a half weeks prior" (4.3.1). Despite maintenance staff carrying out repairs, the defects reappeared, indicating that either the repairs had not remedied the track faults or the root cause of the defects had not been addressed (4.3.1).

Wheel Unloading and Dynamic Interaction
Wheel unloading and dynamic interaction are significant safety themes as they describe the conditions that can lead to a derailment. The document states that "when forces are applied in phase, such as when passing over track with irregularities, the amplitude of oscillations can increase rapidly and lead to wheel unloading and eventually wheel climb" (Page 9). In this incident, the combination of track geometry, wagon condition, wagon loading, and train speed led to wheel unloading and wheel climb, resulting in the derailment (5.1). The track twist defects were specifically mentioned as being outside allowable tolerances and should have been rectified at least five weeks before the derailment (5.2).

Asset Management Systems
Asset management systems are a safety theme related to how infrastructure assets are managed and maintained. In this accident, the lack of a robust asset management system contributed to the recurrence of track defects. KiwiRail's previous system did not require track maintenance staff to record the nature of the repair work, materials used, or methods applied, and no records were kept of the track condition after each repair (4.3.1). This was addressed by implementing a new computerized track infrastructure asset management system known as 'Maximo', which includes a review of completed work and provides detailed oversight of repair and maintenance activities (4.3.5).

Monitoring and Quality Assurance
Monitoring and quality assurance are essential safety themes to ensure that maintenance and repair work is effective and that the root causes of defects are addressed. The accident investigation revealed that KiwiRail did not have an adequate system for monitoring the effectiveness of repair work. "The rail de-stressing work and the subsequent track failures that should have been prevented by that work were another example of the system not recording the work done and monitoring its effectiveness" (4.3.2). KiwiRail has since taken steps to improve this by requiring a senior track engineer to review track defect printouts after each track-evaluation car journey and by implementing a re-examination program of the procedures and resources used to manage track de-stressing work (4.3.7, 4.3.9).

Training and Competency of Maintenance Staff
The training and competency of maintenance staff are safety themes that relate to the skills and knowledge required to effectively maintain and repair railway infrastructure. In the context of this accident, there was no evidence that the mechanical condition of the wagons contributed to the derailment, and both wagons had undergone scheduled mechanical examinations shortly before derailing (4.2.5). However, the recurring track defects and ineffective repairs suggest that there may have been issues with the competency of the maintenance staff or the methods they used, as there was no requirement to record the nature of the repair work or the condition of the track after repairs (4.3.1).

Organizational Oversight and Standards Compliance
Organizational oversight and standards compliance are safety themes that involve the processes and regulations in place to ensure safe operations. In this incident, the track twist defects that contributed to the derailment were outside the allowable tolerances according to KiwiRail standards and should have been rectified well before the accident occurred (5.2). The lack of effective oversight and compliance with maintenance standards was a contributing factor to the accident, highlighting the need for organizations to enforce and adhere to safety standards rigorously.
Themes for 2020_003: 
Pilot Experience and Skill Development
Pilot experience and skill development is a critical safety theme, as it directly impacts a pilot's ability to safely operate an aircraft. In this accident, the pilot, although legally qualified, was still in the early stages of gaining experience. The report states that "the pilot, while qualified, was in the early stages of gaining experience and skill" (4.1). Furthermore, the report emphasizes that "flying hours alone do not tell the full story" and that "pilot qualifications are therefore both competency- and experience-based" (3.3). The pilot's lack of experience in monitoring the performance of the helicopter, particularly the airspeed-groundspeed relationship, was a contributing factor to the accident (4.9).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves having an accurate understanding of the current conditions and projecting forward to anticipate future states. This theme is relevant to the accident as the pilot failed to adequately monitor the helicopter's performance during a critical phase of the flight. The report indicates that the pilot did not maintain situational awareness of the airspeed-groundspeed relationship, which led to the helicopter slowing down unexpectedly as it turned downwind towards the beach (4.3, 4.9). The pilot's situational awareness was likely compromised as they were focused on conducting a reconnaissance of the landing area (4.2).

Aircraft Handling Characteristics
Understanding and effectively managing the unique handling characteristics of different aircraft types is essential for safe operation. In this accident, the helicopter's design, specifically the Fenestron tail rotor, required more power at low speeds, particularly in hover, which is a disadvantage that can affect handling (3.20). The report suggests that the helicopter began to yaw left due to insufficient tail rotor thrust and not enough right pedal being applied to counter the torque effect as the helicopter slowed (3.23). This indicates that the pilot may not have fully anticipated or managed the handling characteristics of the helicopter's Fenestron tail rotor during the approach.

Training for Emergency Scenarios
Adequate training for emergency scenarios, such as unanticipated yaw events, is crucial for pilots to respond effectively in unexpected situations. The report notes that the pilot of the helicopter was likely informed and trained in various tail rotor emergencies, including unanticipated yaw scenarios (3.34). However, the pilot's inability to recognize and react immediately and appropriately to the sudden yaw suggests that the training may not have been sufficient or that the pilot's response was not as intuitive as required (3.35). This highlights the importance of effective training that enables pilots to internalize emergency procedures.

Approach and Landing Procedures
Proper approach and landing procedures, including wind assessment and selection of the approach path, are vital for safe aircraft operation. The report discusses the importance of knowing the wind direction and the optimal approach to the landing area, which would have been directly from the south in the prevailing conditions (3.47, 3.48). The pilot's decision to turn downwind towards the beach during the approach phase contributed to the loss of control (4.3). This indicates that the pilot's approach and landing procedures were not aligned with the optimal safety practices for the conditions.

Human Factors and Startle Effect
Human factors, such as the startle effect, can significantly impact a pilot's ability to respond to unexpected events. The report suggests that the sudden and rapid yaw of the helicopter likely startled the pilot, which may have led to disorientation and an inability to take corrective action (3.53, 3.54). The startle effect was cited in several investigations where there appeared to be no recovery action taken after the initial yaw (3.30). This safety theme underscores the need for training that prepares pilots to manage their physiological and psychological responses to sudden emergencies.
Themes for 2014_105: 
Worksite Protection Procedures
Worksite protection procedures are protocols designed to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment when work is being conducted on or near operational infrastructure, such as railway tracks. This theme is highly relevant to the accident because the rail protection officer failed to comply with the procedures for providing protection, which nearly resulted in a collision. The report states that "Failure to comply with any of the processes or procedures for providing protection can potentially result in a collision" (4.1.1). Additionally, the rail protection officer handed back the track warrant without positively establishing that the work group at Bridge 49 was off and clear, which was "a serious breach of KiwiRail rules" (4.2.15).

Fatigue Management
Fatigue management involves strategies to prevent accidents and errors that may occur due to workers being tired or overworked. This theme is relevant to the accident as the rail protection officer was likely fatigued at the time he reported the track as clear when it was not. The report indicates that there was "insufficient management of the rail protection officer's day-to-day workload, which likely contributed to his being fatigued" (4.1.3). Furthermore, the rail protection officer's impaired judgment, which included making the incorrect assumption that the work had been completed, was consistent with fatigue-related performance (4.4.14).

Communication and Coordination
Effective communication and coordination are critical for ensuring safety in operations involving multiple workers and work sites. This theme is relevant because the rail protection officer relied on a verbal instruction and did not confirm that the incoming leading hands had received the instruction to call him when the track was clear (4.2.11). Additionally, the rail protection officer's absence from the site at the critical time to confirm that the protected work area was clear before handing back the track warrant indicates a failure in communication and coordination (4.2.10, 4.2.15).

Planning and Resource Allocation
Planning and resource allocation involve ensuring that work is properly scheduled and that sufficient resources, including personnel, are available to carry out tasks safely. This theme is relevant because the work group was under-resourced to manage the protection and safety of the work group effectively, as indicated by the failure to follow operating procedures at the planning stage (4.3.1). The late application for work and the omission of a communication plan were also factors contributing to the incident (5.3).

Rule Compliance and Enforcement
Rule compliance and enforcement ensure that all personnel adhere to established safety rules and regulations. This theme is relevant because the rail protection officer did not comply with KiwiRail's rules, which required him to be on-site to confirm the work area was clear before handing back the track warrant (4.2.15). The report also mentions that the rail protection officer's behavior indicated that he knew he should have been on-site at the time of giving clearance (4.2.16).

Continuous Improvement and Policy Update
Continuous improvement and policy update refer to the ongoing efforts to enhance safety measures and update policies based on lessons learned from incidents. This theme is relevant as KiwiRail introduced new Track Safety Rule 902 after the incident, which provides clearer guidance on the location of the rail protection officer and the handover of protected work areas (4.2.6, 4.2.7, 4.2.8). The report suggests that had this new rule been in place at the time and complied with, the incident would not have occurred (4.2.9).
Themes for 2018_203: 
Bridge Resource Management and Human Factors
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that involves the effective management of all the resources available to the bridge team, promoting good communication, teamwork, and the ability to respond to dangerous situations and emergencies. In the case of the Leda Maersk grounding, the standard of BRM "fell short of industry good practice" (5.4). The bridge team was not fully following company policies and procedures for navigating in pilotage waters (5.5), and there was a lack of effective teamwork, as evidenced by the bridge team's reliance on the pilot and their failure to actively monitor the ship's progress on electronic navigation equipment (4.6.2). This resulted in a single point of failure when the pilot lost situational awareness, leading to the grounding (4.7.2).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is the understanding of what is happening in one's immediate environment and is critical for safe navigation. In the Leda Maersk incident, the bridge team and the pilot lost situational awareness, as they were navigating primarily by visual means and not fully utilizing electronic navigation aids, which would have shown the ship's deviation from the intended track (4.8.3, 4.8.4). The lack of situational awareness was a significant factor contributing to the grounding (5.2).

Use of Electronic Navigation Aids
The use of electronic navigation aids such as ECDIS and radar is essential for safe navigation, especially in narrow channels and during night operations. In the Leda Maersk grounding, the bridge team and pilot were not fully using these aids, which "clearly showed the ship deviating from the centre of the channel" (5.2). The ECDIS off-track alert was not communicated to the rest of the bridge team, which could have alerted them to the deviation and allowed for corrective action before the grounding (4.9.1).

Compliance with Safety Management Systems
Adherence to safety management systems (SMS) is crucial for ensuring safe ship operations. The Leda Maersk's bridge team did not fully comply with the company's SMS, particularly in monitoring the ship's position and movement and ensuring safe under-keel clearance (4.11.3). The grounding highlighted a failure to follow several policies of the SMS, indicating that procedural failures may not have been confined to this one accident (4.11.12).

Pilotage and Training Standards
Pilotage involves the use of maritime pilots to navigate ships through hazardous or congested waters. The Leda Maersk grounding revealed that Port Otago's safety management system "fell short of achieving industry standards for pilot training" (5.6). The pilot on board had not been subject to an annual assessment or peer review since 2012, and there was no formal policy or training for the use of PPUs (4.11.19, 4.11.20).

Organisational Culture and Safety Culture
Organisational culture and safety culture refer to the collective values, beliefs, and practices regarding safety within an organization. In the case of the Leda Maersk, there were indications that the ship's crew were not following the bridge and navigation aspects of the safety management system, and the port operator's safety management system had not been fully developed (4.10.1, 4.11.18). The grounding suggests that the safety culture may have been compromised, as evidenced by the lack of adherence to safety practices and procedures (4.11.12).
Themes for 2014_202: 
Equipment Maintenance and Inspection
Equipment maintenance and inspection is a critical safety theme as it involves the regular checking and servicing of equipment to ensure it is functioning correctly and to prevent accidents. In the case of the lifeboat accident, the master inspected the launching equipment, including the wire slings, recovery hook, and high-pressure piping of the hydraulic davit before the operation commenced ("Before the operation commenced the master inspected the launching equipment, including the wire slings, recovery hook and high-pressure piping of the hydraulic davit" (3.1.8)). However, despite this inspection, the wire slings failed, leading to the lifeboat falling several meters to the water ("The lifeboat was just clearing railing at the stern when one of the four wire slings parted, followed immediately by the three remaining wire slings in quick succession" (3.1.12)). This suggests that the inspection may not have been thorough enough or that there were issues with the maintenance of the equipment.

Crew Training and Preparedness
Crew training and preparedness is a safety theme that involves ensuring that all crew members are adequately trained and prepared for emergency situations. In this incident, the crew members were required to board the lifeboat, secure themselves in their seats, and commence launch procedures as part of a routine safety drill ("All crew members are required to board the lifeboat, secure themselves in their seats and commence launch procedures" (3.2.1)). However, the third officer had removed his restraints in preparation for disembarking before the accident occurred, which resulted in him being thrown off his seat and sustaining a head injury ("Some time before the wire slings parted, the third officer had removed his restraints in preparation for disembarking" (3.1.13)). This indicates that there may have been a lapse in following safety procedures or a lack of preparedness for the possibility of an accident during the drill.

Safety Equipment Reliability
Safety equipment reliability refers to the dependability of equipment designed to protect the crew and passengers during emergencies. The failure of the wire slings, which were a critical component of the lifeboat's launching system, directly led to the accident ("The lifeboat was just clearing railing at the stern when one of the four wire slings parted, followed immediately by the three remaining wire slings in quick succession" (3.1.12)). This failure raises concerns about the reliability of the safety equipment and whether it was fit for purpose, suggesting that the equipment may not have been adequately tested or maintained.

Emergency Response and Medical Readiness
Emergency response and medical readiness is a safety theme that involves having proper procedures and resources in place to respond to accidents and provide immediate medical attention. After the lifeboat fell, the port staff and ship's crew helped the lifeboat crew ashore, and an ambulance was requested and arrived to transport the injured to the hospital ("The lifeboat crew disembarked on their own and were helped ashore by port staff and the ship's crew. A member of the port staff who had witnessed the incident requested an ambulance to be dispatched" (3.1.14), "At about 1140 an ambulance arrived and the injured third officer and able-bodied seaman were transported to hospital" (3.1.15)). This indicates that there was a response to the emergency and medical services were available, but it also raises questions about the timeliness and effectiveness of the response.

Communication and Coordination During Operations
Communication and coordination during operations is a safety theme that involves ensuring clear and effective communication among crew members and proper coordination of activities during safety-critical operations. In the reported incident, the chief officer communicated with the master to inform him that the crew were secured by their restraints and that the lifeboat was ready to be hoisted ("Once the wire slings were connected to the lifeboat davit, the chief officer radioed the master and informed him that the crew were secured by their restraints and that the lifeboat was ready to be hoisted" (3.1.10)). This demonstrates that there was a communication protocol in place, but the subsequent accident suggests that there may have been a breakdown in coordination or a failure to communicate critical information about the condition of the equipment.

Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards
Regulatory compliance and safety standards is a safety theme that involves adhering to established regulations and standards designed to ensure the safety of maritime operations. The operation was conducted in accordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS), which requires a freefall lifeboat to be lowered from its cradle at least once every three months ("The International Maritime Organization (IMO) International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS) requires a freefall lifeboat to be lowered from its cradle at least once every three months" (3.2.1)). However, the accident indicates that despite compliance with these regulations, there may be gaps in the safety standards or their implementation that need to be addressed to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Themes for 2010_004: 
Adherence to Procedures
Adherence to procedures is a safety theme that involves following established protocols and checklists to ensure the safety of operations. In the context of this accident, the failure to adhere to procedures was a significant factor. The first officer did not check the cargo door as required, which is a critical procedure for ensuring the door's security on a pressurized aircraft ("the first officer not checking that it was locked as he was required to do" (4.2)). Additionally, the crew did not follow the Defence Door Policy Guide (DDPG) requirement for a crew member to check the security of the cargo door, which was a defense against the door inadvertently not being closed properly ("The crew not following that requirement removed that defence" (4.2)). This theme is relevant because the established procedures are designed to prevent such incidents, and the failure to follow them directly contributed to the accident.

Assumption of Actions by Others
Assumption of actions by others is a safety theme where individuals rely on the expected actions of their colleagues without verification. This theme is relevant to the accident as the loader, first officer, and captain all made unchecked assumptions about the actions or intended actions of others regarding the closure and locking of the cargo door ("It also involved a number of unchecked assumptions being made by the loader, first officer and captain about the actions or intended actions of others" (4.2)). The first officer assumed the loader had closed and locked the door, which was a critical error ("the first officer to believe the loader had done so on this occasion" (4.3)). This theme highlights the importance of verifying critical safety actions rather than assuming they have been completed.

Distraction During Critical Procedures
Distraction during critical procedures is a safety theme that recognizes the impact of interruptions or distractions on the performance of essential safety tasks. In this accident, the first officer was distracted during the final walk-around inspection, which led to the omission of a critical check on the cargo door ("The removal of the nose wheel chocks was not normal and was a greater distraction for the first officer" (4.4)). The first officer's routine was interrupted, and he did not return to the point in the checklist where he was interrupted, nor did he start the routine again, as would be the correct procedure ("the person running the checklist should return to the point in the checklist where he or she was interrupted from task, or if that is unclear, start the routine again" (4.4)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates how distractions can lead to oversights that compromise safety.

Visual Confirmation and Indicator Effectiveness
Visual confirmation and indicator effectiveness is a safety theme that involves the use of visual checks and indicators to confirm the status of equipment or systems. In this incident, the faded paint on the visual lock indicator and the faulty cargo door sensor compromised the effectiveness of visual confirmation ("The faded paint on the visual lock indicator meant positive confirmation of the door being closed required a close-up check of the indicator" (4.3), "The faulty cargo door sensor effectively removed a source of warning to the crew that the cargo door might not be properly secured" (5.3)). The reliance on visual indicators without proper verification contributed to the accident, making this theme highly relevant.

Training and Use of Safety Skills
Training and use of safety skills is a safety theme that focuses on the application of learned safety practices and procedures in operations. The crew in this incident had been trained in "threat and error management" (TEM), but they did not apply these skills effectively to prevent the incident ("The use of these TEM skills by the crew could have prevented the incident" (4.8)). The crew failed to recognize the defective cargo door warning system as a "threat" and did not confirm that the necessary actions were taken to manage this threat ("if both pilots had recognised...that the defective cargo door warning system was a 'threat' to safety of flight, they almost certainly would have paid close attention to the ddpg requirement" (4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of not only having safety training but also applying it consistently to ensure safety.

Organizational Safety Culture
Organizational safety culture is a safety theme that pertains to the collective values, attitudes, and behaviors regarding safety within an organization. The report suggests that the operator's instructions and the established safety culture did not sufficiently emphasize the importance of individual responsibility for safety actions ("an operator's instruction that if the cargo door was closed it had to be locked and checked by the person closing it would have reduced the risk of the door being inadvertently left unlocked" (5.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). The lack of robust discussion between the pilots about the cargo door annunciator light also indicates a safety culture that did not promote critical questioning and verification ("The discussion between the 2 pilots was not robust enough to challenge the mindset" (4.7)). This theme is relevant as it highlights how organizational practices and culture can influence individual behaviors and safety outcomes.
Themes for 2013_010: 
Pilot's Spatial Judgement and Approach Misjudgment
The theme of pilot's spatial judgement and approach misjudgment is relevant to this accident as the pilot misjudged his spacing from the parked helicopter during the landing approach, which was a contributing factor to the near-collision and subsequent collision. The analysis indicated that "the pilot clearly misjudged his spacing twice" (4.6.2), and despite the favorable conditions and the parked helicopter serving as an excellent visual reference, the pilot failed to ensure a safe separation (4.6.2). Additionally, the pilot's previous behavior of misjudging approaches was noted, and "the possibility that the pilot had reverted to his previously reported behaviour and misjudged his approach could not be excluded" (6.2).

Visual Reference Loss in Blowing Snow
Loss of visual reference in blowing snow is a safety theme because the pilot likely carried out the go-around due to loss of depth perception and sight of the other helicopter in blowing snow (6.6). The analysis considered the possibility that the pilot might have lost visual reference with the other helicopter due to blowing snow (4.1.3.b). Although it was unlikely that blowing snow significantly affected the pilot's view during the second approach (6.7), the first go-around was attributed to the pilot not discerning the parked helicopter's rotor disc and turning too soon (4.6.3).

Helicopter Performance and Weight Management
Helicopter performance and weight management is a safety theme because the analysis included consideration of whether a performance limit was reached due to the helicopter's weight and center of gravity position (4.4). The helicopter's weight and center of gravity were estimated to be within flight manual limits at the time of the accident (6.9), and the operator's procedures regarding the use of standard loading plans did not ensure compliance with the Civil Aviation Rule that helicopters are to be flown within the limitations published in the flight manual (6.10). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of accurate weight and balance calculations for safe helicopter operations.

Medical or Psychological Conditions Affecting Pilot Performance
The theme of medical or psychological conditions affecting pilot performance is relevant as the investigation considered whether the pilot's actions could be explained by a medical or psychological condition (4.5). There was no evidence to suggest that the pilot had a medical condition that contributed to the accident, but this possibility could not be excluded (6.11). The analysis also explored the potential for an "obscure psychological effect" but found it unlikely to have been a contributing factor (4.6.4).

Flight Following and Communication of Route Changes
Flight following and communication of route changes is a safety theme because the investigation identified a safety issue where pilots do not inform their flight-following organizations of changes to their routes or destinations, which could delay or misdirect any required search and rescue action (5.1). In this case, the pilot radioed the operator's base that the two helicopters were about to land at the Lochnagar Saddle, but the actual landing took place about three kilometers away (5.3). This highlights the importance of accurate and timely communication for effective flight following and search and rescue operations.

Risks Associated with Disembarking with Rotors Turning
The risks associated with disembarking with rotors turning is a safety theme identified during the inquiry, which pertains to the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to a helicopter parked on snow while the rotors are turning (5.1). Although not a factor in this accident, the practice poses a serious risk to people on the ground if a helicopter settles into fresh snow or breaks through a surface crust, potentially reducing clearance between the rotor disc and people walking beneath (5.8). This theme underscores the need for safe procedures during passenger disembarkation and embarkation in snowy conditions.
Themes for 2012_201: 
Vessel Stability and Loading
Vessel stability and proper loading are critical safety themes in maritime operations. In the case of the Easy Rider, the vessel was "loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff" (5.2). The vessel's stability was compromised due to the extra load of cargo on deck and the passengers themselves, which raised the center of gravity and consequently reduced the stability reserve (4.3.7). This made the vessel "tender," meaning it would take only a small force or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel to take on an angle (4.3.8). The vessel's poor stability was a prime factor leading to its capsize when it was hit by a large breaking wave (5.16).

Weather Conditions and Voyage Planning
Weather conditions and voyage planning are essential safety themes in maritime operations. The Easy Rider embarked on its journey despite forecasts of unsuitable weather conditions, including high winds and significant wave heights (4.4.1). The vessel's decision to sail at night with "marginal stability and with passengers on board" was not prudent, especially given the forecasted weather (5.3). Other experienced fishermen had chosen to stay in port that night, indicating that the skipper's decision to depart was influenced by a pre-arranged rendezvous rather than safety considerations (4.4.2).

Safety Equipment and Emergency Preparedness
Safety equipment and emergency preparedness are vital for survival in the event of a maritime accident. The Easy Rider was found to be lacking in life-saving equipment, as there were "as few as 4 approved lifejackets on board the Easy Rider to be shared among 9 people" (5.9). Additionally, the vessel's life-raft, designed for only 4 people, was not able to float free during the sinking (5.10). The manually operated emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) had not been intentionally activated and was still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the vessel sank (5.6). These factors significantly reduced the chances of survival for those on board.

Qualifications and Training of Crew
The qualifications and training of the crew are crucial for the safe operation of a vessel. In the case of the Easy Rider, the skipper did not hold the required qualification to be in charge of the vessel on the accident voyage (5.15). The skipper also lacked the requisite knowledge of ship stability, which is fundamental for any commercial operator (5.16). This lack of qualifications and training contributed to the skipper's inability to recognize the warning signs of poor stability and to load the vessel appropriately, leading to the vessel's capsize.

Regulatory Compliance and Safe Ship Management
Regulatory compliance and adherence to safe ship management practices are essential for ensuring the safety of maritime operations. The Easy Rider had entered the safe ship management system but was not operated in compliance with the rules, as the owner did not understand the principles of safe ship management, and the skipper did not show a willingness to comply (5.13). The owner was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe operation of the vessel as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules (5.14). The vessel was also operating without a valid safety compliance inspection (4.6.22).

Record-Keeping and Information Management
Proper record-keeping and information management are important for maintaining the safety and operational history of vessels. In the investigation of the Easy Rider accident, there was difficulty accessing sufficient information about the vessel due to historical issues with keeping ship operation and safety records (5.16). The loss of important records can hinder the ability to assess a vessel's stability and safety characteristics, as was the case with the Easy Rider, where the stability assessment booklet was lost or not handed on to another owner (4.6.2). A central database of all important safety and operation records is recommended to avoid such issues in the future (5.16).
Themes for 2017_105: 
Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
Compliance with traffic control devices is a safety theme relevant to this accident because the truck did not stop at the compulsory stop sign at the level crossing. The report states, "The data showed that the truck stopped to service bins either side of the level crossing, but did not stop at the level crossing, which was protected by a compulsory stop sign" (4.2.2). This indicates that the truck driver's non-compliance with the stop sign was a contributing factor to the accident.

Sighting Distance at Level Crossings
Sighting distance at level crossings is a critical safety theme as it affects the ability of a road user to detect an oncoming train in time to stop safely. In this accident, "the maximum sighting distance available to the truck driver had been reduced from 423 metres to 83 metres" due to vegetation growth, which meant that "even if the truck had stopped at the yellow limit line, the truck driver would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing safely in the event of a train approaching from just out of the driver's view" (4.4.8). This reduction in sighting distance significantly increased the risk of an accident at the level crossing.

Use of Seatbelts
The use of seatbelts is a safety theme that, while it may not have contributed to the occurrence of the accident, is relevant to the survivability of the collision. The report notes that "After the accident the seatbelt was found to be unlocked. It was therefore unlikely that the driver was wearing a seatbelt at the time of impact" (4.3.1). Although it could not be determined if wearing a seatbelt would have saved the driver, "wearing a seatbelt will generally increase the chances of a person surviving an accident" (4.3.2), highlighting the importance of seatbelt use.

Driver Awareness and Expectation
Driver awareness and expectation is a safety theme related to this accident due to the possibility that the truck driver had a low expectation of encountering a train. The report suggests that "One explanation for the driver not stopping was a low expectation of encountering a train at the level crossing" (4.2.13). With an average of eight trains each day and the possibility that the truck driver had never encountered a train at the crossing before, the driver's expectation could have influenced their decision not to stop.

Vegetation Control Around Level Crossings
Vegetation control around level crossings is a safety theme because it directly impacts the sighting distance and, consequently, the safety of the level crossing. The report identifies that "vegetation growth can relatively quickly render a level crossing unsafe" (4.4.11) and that in this case, vegetation had obscured the view, reducing the sighting distance from 423 metres to 83 metres (4.4.8). This lack of visibility was a significant factor in the accident.

Clarity of Responsibility for Level Crossing Safety
Clarity of responsibility for level crossing safety is a safety theme that emerges from the report's findings. The report points out that "The legislation needs to be clearer on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail users and road users at public level crossings" (5.7). This lack of clarity can lead to inadequate maintenance or safety measures, as was the case with the vegetation control that contributed to the reduced sighting distance at the level crossing.
Themes for 2010_201: 
Enclosed Space Entry Procedures
Enclosed space entry procedures are a set of guidelines and practices designed to ensure the safety of personnel when entering spaces with limited openings, unfavorable natural ventilation, or not designed for continuous worker occupancy. This theme is highly relevant to the accident as the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space without checking the atmosphere, which was found to be oxygen-depleted and contained toxic gases like CO and H2S, leading to his rapid incapacitation and subsequent death. "The accident sequence started when the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space without checking that the atmosphere was suitable for entry and without following the appropriate safety precautions" (4.2.1). Furthermore, the document highlights that "Being a dedicated log carrier, the risk of death by entering enclosed cargo holds containing logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency response training programme" (5.4), indicating that the procedures for safe entry into enclosed spaces were not adequately followed or enforced.

Training and Drills for Emergency Response
Training and drills for emergency response are essential for preparing crew members to handle emergencies effectively. This theme is relevant to the accident as there was no evidence of the crew being trained or drills being conducted for enclosed space rescue in the three months preceding the accident. "No evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed" (5.4). The lack of training and drills contributed to an uncoordinated and delayed response to the emergency, which compromised the potential for a successful rescue. "The rescue response from the vessel's master and crew was not well coordinated or practised" (5.7).

Awareness and Compliance with Safety Regulations
Awareness and compliance with safety regulations are critical for maintaining a safe working environment. This theme is relevant as the document indicates that the chief officer, despite being experienced and responsible for safe working practices, did not adhere to well-documented precautions for enclosed space entry. "the commission was unable to determine why the chief officer... would enter an enclosed space without taking well documented precautions" (4.2.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Additionally, the document suggests that the ship's safety management system failed to ensure compliance with safety regulations, as "no record could be found of specific training for the crew to highlight the danger of entering enclosed cargo holds" (4.4.6).

Hazard Recognition and Risk Assessment
Hazard recognition and risk assessment involve identifying potential dangers and evaluating the risks associated with them. This theme is relevant to the accident as the crew members failed to recognize the hazards associated with the log cargo, which depleted oxygen levels and emitted toxic gases. "Organic cargoes such as logs were known to deplete oxygen in enclosed atmospheres" (4.3.2). The failure to assess the risks properly led to the chief officer entering the hold without precautions and the deck crew member attempting a rescue without recognizing the cause of the chief officer's collapse. "The deck crew member might not necessarily have been aware that the chief officer had collapsed from asphyxiation" (4.2.4).

Effective Communication and Coordination During Emergencies
Effective communication and coordination during emergencies are vital for a timely and organized response to critical situations. This theme is relevant as the document describes the crew's response to the emergency as uncoordinated and independent, with delays in sounding the general alarm and confusion about the accident location. "the response was uncoordinated, with several different parties taking action independently of each other until the general alarm was raised approximately 8 minutes after the event" (4.5.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The lack of effective communication and coordination delayed the rescue efforts and may have impacted the survivability of the victims.

Safety Culture and Leadership
Safety culture and leadership refer to the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety, and the role of leaders in promoting and enforcing a safety-first mindset. This theme is relevant as the document suggests a breakdown in the safety culture and leadership on board the vessel. Despite the bosun's warnings, the chief officer still entered the hold, indicating a possible disregard for safety protocols. "The bosun asked the chief officer twice not to enter the hold because he knew of the dangers" (4.4.7). Additionally, the master's actions during the emergency did not demonstrate effective leadership or control, further indicating issues with the safety culture. "Had the master taken appropriate control of the situation, sounded the alarm and contacted the shore authorities before going to the scene then the rescue may well have been expedited" (4.5.3).
Themes for 2018_206: 
Bridge Resource Management
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Alam Seri, the standard of BRM was not in accordance with good industry practice. The pilot, master, and bridge team had not discussed the pilot's intended actions to execute the passage plan, and no challenge parameters had been set to guide the bridge team on when they should challenge the pilot's actions ("The standard of bridge resource management was not in accordance with good industry practice" (4.6)). This lack of communication and planning could have contributed to the incident as the bridge team was not prepared to effectively monitor and respond to the vessel's progress against the passage plan.

Pilot Training and Proficiency
Pilot training and proficiency are critical for ensuring that pilots have the necessary skills and knowledge to safely navigate vessels in specific pilotage areas. The report indicates that the pilot was seven months overdue for a required annual assessment of proficiency, meaning South Port's pilot assessment regime for the Bluff pilotage area was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan ("The pilot was seven months overdue for a required annual assessment of proficiency" (4.10)). This safety theme is relevant because the lack of up-to-date training and proficiency assessment could have affected the pilot's performance and decision-making during the incident.

Use of Electronic Navigational Aids
Electronic navigational aids, such as Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) and Portable Pilot Units (PPUs), enhance situational awareness and provide real-time information on a vessel's position and predicted movements. The Alam Seri was not fitted with an ECDIS at the time of the incident, and the pilot was not using a PPU, which could have provided valuable information during the transit ("the only real-time means available to the bridge team for determining the vessel's exact movements were radar and visual navigation" (3.31)). The absence of these aids likely reduced the bridge team's situational awareness and their ability to respond effectively to the developing situation ("The bridge team's situational awareness, particularly during the recovery manoeuvres, would likely have been improved had there been an electronic chart display and information system or a portable pilot unit in use at the time of the incident" (4.9)).

Environmental Conditions and Vessel Manoeuvrability
Environmental conditions, such as wind and current, can significantly impact a vessel's manoeuvrability. In the case of the Alam Seri, the wind was from the east-southeast at a strength of about 25 knots, gusting to 32 knots, which acted on the starboard side of the vessel and affected its heading and ability to turn ("The wind acted on the starboard side of the vessel" (3.11)). The vessel's manoeuvrability was further compromised by a reduction in engine speed, which reduced the effectiveness of the rudder ("a reduction in engine speed reduced the effectiveness of the rudder to a point where the rudder could not overcome the turning moment created by strong wind acting on the starboard side of the ship" (4.1)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the challenges faced by the vessel in maintaining its intended course under the prevailing environmental conditions.

Readiness of Critical Standby Equipment
The readiness of critical standby equipment, such as anchors, is essential for emergency situations where immediate action is required to prevent an accident. In this incident, when the order was given to let go the port anchor, it did not deploy as expected, and multiple attempts were needed to release the starboard anchor ("when the order was given to let go the port anchor, the brake was released and the anchor did not deploy" (3.50)). This issue is relevant because the failure of the anchors to deploy promptly could have affected the outcome of the emergency response and the ability to prevent the vessel from grounding.

Adherence to Safety Management Systems
Safety management systems are designed to establish procedures and controls to manage risks and ensure safe operations. The report indicates that South Port's safety management system had measures in place for pilot training and proficiency, but these were not being met as required by the training manual ("meaning South Port's pilot assessment regime for the Bluff pilotage area was not meeting the requirements of its approved pilot training and proficiency plan" (4.10)). This theme is relevant because the lack of adherence to the established safety management system could have contributed to the incident by allowing gaps in pilot proficiency and training to go unaddressed.
Themes for 2011_105: 
Human Error and Error Detection
Human error is a significant safety theme in this accident, as the train controller made critical mistakes that led to the wrong-routing of the freight train onto a closed track. The report states, "The train controller made errors that resulted in his wrong-routing the freight train from the open southbound track across to the closed northbound track" (4.1.1). Furthermore, the errors could have been detected and prevented if there had been a system in place for cross-checking with the person-in-charge that control blocking was in place (4.1.3). The lack of such a system allowed the train controller's errors to go unnoticed for over two hours (5.2).

Crew Resource Management
Crew resource management is another safety theme related to this accident, as it involves the use of all available resources within a group to improve safety. The report highlights that the train driver had an opportunity to avert the incident by voicing his concerns when he noticed the discrepancy in the routing but did not challenge the train controller's instructions (4.4.4). This indicates a need for better crew resource management practices, where all participants are aware of the plan and use all available resources to execute it safely (4.4.1).

Communication and Challenge Culture
Communication and the culture of challenging authority when safety is concerned are crucial safety themes. The train driver was reluctant to challenge the train controller's instruction, which he thought was incorrect (4.1.5). The report suggests that if the train driver had challenged the train controller, the potential collision might have been averted (4.4.4). This highlights the importance of fostering an environment where crew members feel empowered to speak up and question decisions for the sake of safety.

Clarity of Safety Documentation
The clarity and presentation of safety documentation is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The special work bulletin, which contained critical information for the operation, was not presented in a clear and logical format, making it difficult for stakeholders like train drivers and controllers to understand the operational arrangements (4.5.4). The report finds that "The special bulletin outlining the plan for the major infrastructure and maintenance work did not present information to maintenance and operational staff in a clear and logical format" (5.4).

Safety Protocols and Procedures
Safety protocols and procedures are a theme as the accident revealed gaps in KiwiRail's safety rules. Specifically, the rules did not require a cross-check confirmation that appropriate blocking had been applied to protect the section of track closed for maintenance work (4.1.5). The absence of this requirement in the rules meant that the train controller's error went undetected, leading to the incident (4.3.5, 5.2).

Distractions in the Work Environment
Distractions in the work environment constitute a safety theme, as the presence of unauthorized visitors in the train control cubicle could have distracted the train controller from conducting a final check of the train control diagram before authorizing the final movement (4.2.7). Although their presence did not influence the initial error, it is concerning that such visits were allowed contrary to company rules, indicating a potential safety risk (4.2.7).
Themes for 2011_002: 
Inhibit Switch Reliability and System Redundancy
The inhibit switch defect was a critical factor in the accident, as it caused both the loss of nosewheel steering and the failure of the landing gear to extend normally. The report states that "a faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel steering when the aircraft was departing from Hamilton" and "the same faulty inhibit switch was the cause of the landing gear not extending normally when the aircraft was approaching Wellington" (5.1, 5.2). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of system reliability and the need for effective redundancy in critical systems to prevent a single point of failure from leading to an accident.

Crew Training and Familiarity with Emergency Procedures
The training provided to the pilots did not adequately prepare them for the alternate landing gear extension procedure. The report found that "the training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension procedure did not include key information provided by Bombardier concerning the release handle forces, and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure" (5.6). This theme is significant because it underscores the necessity for comprehensive training that includes all relevant information and prepares crew members for emergency situations they may encounter.

Simulator Fidelity and Training Effectiveness
The simulator used for training did not accurately represent the actual forces required to release the uplock, which contributed to the failure of the alternate landing gear extension procedure during the accident. The report indicates that "the simulator that Air Nelson used for training its pilots in the alternate landing gear extension procedure was not representative of the actual forces required to release the uplock" (5.7). This theme is relevant as it emphasizes the importance of high-fidelity simulators in pilot training to ensure that pilots are fully prepared for the physical realities of emergency procedures.

QRH Design and Usability
The design and usability of the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were identified as factors that could lead to errors during emergency procedures. The report notes that "the similarity of text in adjacent steps of the QRH and the lack of numbered steps contributed to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non-normal procedures" (5.8). This theme is relevant because it highlights the need for clear, well-structured emergency procedures to minimize the risk of misinterpretation or omission during high-stress situations.

Communication and Information Sharing
Effective communication and information sharing are crucial in emergency situations. The report discusses opportunities for more effective communication between pilots and between pilots and other airline staff, suggesting that "having pertinent information generally assists with better decision-making" (4.37). This theme is relevant to the accident because timely and accurate communication could have provided the technical staff with the information needed to recognize the connection between the nosewheel steering defect and the failure of the normal landing gear extension, potentially preventing the accident.

Operational Decision-Making and Risk Assessment
The decision to permit operations without the nosewheel steering was based on operational considerations without fully assessing the potential for related system failures. The report states that "The Minimum Equipment List provision that had previously allowed a flight to commence without an operative nosewheel steering system appeared to be based on operational considerations only, and to have not considered the possibility of a related system failure" (5.3). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for thorough risk assessment and decision-making processes that consider all possible outcomes and interdependencies between systems.
Themes for 2011_101: 
Communication and Crew Resource Management
Communication and crew resource management are critical for ensuring that all parties involved in train operations are aware of the plans and can work together effectively to prevent accidents. In this incident, the "KiwiRail train controller's plan to cross Trains 210 and 201 at Papakura was not disseminated to all the parties who needed to know" (5.6), which led to missed opportunities to avert the potential head-on collision. Furthermore, despite previous recommendations to improve communication and crew resource management, "this incident demonstrates that the standard has not reached an acceptable level" (5.7), highlighting the ongoing relevance of this safety theme.

Signaller Training and Certification
The training and certification of signallers are essential to ensure they are prepared to handle the complexities of their role. In this case, the signaller involved "had only 8 months' total experience as a signal box controller and had not worked there in the previous 6 months" (5.4), which may not have been sufficient to deal with the operational complexity at the time of the incident. Additionally, there were "gaps noted relating to her practical training using the mis.60 procedure" (4.1.33 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and she had not undergone the required formal level A safety observations (4.1.34), indicating that her training and certification were not adequate for the demands of the situation.

Workload and Task Complexity
The workload and complexity of tasks assigned to individuals can significantly impact their ability to maintain situational awareness and perform their duties safely. In this incident, the signaller "was likely to have been distracted by other tasks that had been assigned to her" (5.3), contributing to her momentarily losing sight of the train controller's plan. The signaller was also "nervous about managing the complexity of the work at the Papakura signal box" (4.1.20), and the amount of activity and complexity during the upgrade work "should have warranted more resources being provided to the signal box function" (4.1.22), underscoring the importance of this safety theme.

Procedural Compliance and Blocking Systems
Adherence to established procedures and the effectiveness of blocking systems are crucial for preventing accidents. In this incident, the signaller removed a collar that was part of the train signalling "blocking" procedure without seeking the required authorization (4.1.2), and the system in place did not have a "double 'blocking' ability" to remind the signaller that two authorizations were needed (5.2). This failure to comply with procedures and the inadequacy of the blocking system were directly related to the potential for a head-on collision.

Fatigue Management
Managing fatigue is important for ensuring that individuals are able to perform their duties safely. Although in this case, the signaller had worked longer hours than normal and had worked "12 of the previous 13 days before the incident" (4.1.15), it was determined that fatigue due to her roster "was not likely to have contributed to her momentarily losing sight of the train controller's plan" (5.5). Nevertheless, the theme of fatigue management is relevant as it is a common risk factor in the rail industry and can significantly impair performance.

Safety Observations and Audits
Regular safety observations and audits are necessary to identify and correct unsafe practices and ensure compliance with safety procedures. In this incident, the signaller "had not undergone the required formal level A safety observations" (4.1.34), and "Veolia had not performed safety observations for some of its other signallers either" (4.1.36). The audit system had detected this weakness in Veolia's safety system, but "the matter had not been satisfactorily addressed at the time of this incident" (5.9), making this a significant safety theme related to the accident.
Themes for 2020_201: 
Bridge Resource Management
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) refers to the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Rose Harmony, poor BRM was identified as a significant factor contributing to the collision. The situational awareness of the bridge team was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, which was exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters ("safety issue: the situational awareness of the bridge team on the rose harmony was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters" (3.10)). This indicates that the bridge team was not effectively managing the available resources, including the radar equipment and personnel, to maintain situational awareness and prevent the collision.

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and being able to project future status. In this incident, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo suffered from low situational awareness. The Rose Harmony's bridge team had low situational awareness of other marine traffic, which was a significant factor in the collision ("The bridge team on board the Rose Harmony, both during the pilotage and immediately after the pilotage ended, had low situational awareness of other marine traffic in the vicinity" (4.3)). Similarly, the watchkeeper on the Leila Jo did not use radar equipment to plot the track of the Rose Harmony, which had been detected ahead, indicating a lack of situational awareness as to the risk of collision ("The sole watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo had low situational awareness as to the risk of collision with the Rose Harmony because the radar equipment was not used to plot the track of the Rose Harmony" (4.5)). This theme is relevant because it directly impacted the ability of both vessels to detect and respond to the risk of collision.

Adherence to Collision Regulations
Adherence to collision regulations, specifically the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), is crucial for the safe navigation of vessels and the prevention of accidents. In this accident, neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules, which led to the collision ("The collision between the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo occurred because neither of the vessels' crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules" (4.1)). Both vessels were required to alter their course to starboard to pass on the port side of each other, which did not happen ("With reference to the collision-prevention rules, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo were power-driven vessels in a head-on situation that required each to alter its course to starboard so that each passed the other on its port side" (4.2)). This theme is relevant as the failure to follow these regulations was a direct cause of the collision.

Distraction on the Bridge
Distraction on the bridge can significantly impair the bridge team's ability to maintain situational awareness and respond to hazards. In the case of the Rose Harmony, the presence of passengers on the bridge was identified as a contributing factor to the collision due to the distraction they caused ("Distraction due to passengers being on the Rose Harmony bridge, the crew improperly using radar equipment, and the absence of long-range scanning to obtain an early warning of the risk of collision, were significant factors contributing to the bridge team's low situational awareness" (4.4)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of minimizing non-essential activities and personnel on the bridge during critical navigation periods to prevent accidents.

Training and Familiarity with Safety Regulations
Proper training and familiarity with safety regulations, such as the COLREGs, are essential for all crew members responsible for navigational watchkeeping. The watchkeeper on the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to undertake a sole watch, which was a safety issue contributing to the accident ("The watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to undertake a sole watch" (4.6)). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for adequate training and understanding of safety regulations to ensure that crew members can effectively identify and respond to risks.

Effective Communication and Challenge in Hierarchical Structures
Effective communication and the ability to challenge decisions within hierarchical structures are critical for safety, especially in emergency situations. In this incident, the third officer on the Rose Harmony did not escalate their communication to challenge the master's decisions effectively, which could have prevented the collision ("One technique to overcome a power-distance relationship is the use of graded assertiveness communication. Communication escalates from probing to alerting to challenging, and eventually to emergency. The third officer was heard probing and alerting the master to the situation on the voyage data recorder's audio recording, but did not take it to the next level of challenge or emergency" (3.20)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates the importance of assertive communication in safety-critical environments, where hesitation or deference can lead to accidents.
Themes for 2015_002: 
Mast Bumping Phenomenon
Mast bumping is a critical safety theme as it is the central event that led to the in-flight breakup of the helicopter. The report states that "the helicopter suffered a mast bumping event that resulted in a main rotor blade contacting the cabin area and initiated an in-flight break-up" (5.1 (invalid formatted quote)). Mast bumping is a known issue with helicopters, particularly with Robinson helicopters, and has been involved in multiple fatal accidents that "have gone largely unexplained" (4.1.3). The report also notes that there have been 12 investigated accidents or incidents involving Robinson helicopters where mast bumping occurred, indicating a recurring safety concern (4.1.6).

Lack of Flight Data Recording
The absence of flight data recorders in small and medium helicopters is a significant safety theme because it hinders the ability to conclusively determine the causes of accidents like mast bumping. The report highlights that "a remedy for the lack of reliable data concerning specific accidents is to record flight data and cockpit video" (4.1.4). The Commission has made a recommendation to promote the need for cockpit video recorders and/or other forms of data capture to address this safety issue (4.1.5). Without such data, it is difficult to learn from accidents and make meaningful recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future (4.1.3).

Pilot Response to Turbulence
The pilot's response to turbulence is a safety theme because it is one of the factors that can potentially lead to mast bumping. The report discusses that turbulence, combined with pilot control inputs, can contribute to a low-G situation, which is a precursor to mast bumping (4.3.1). Robinson's opinion is that "turbulence alone does not cause mast bumping, but rather it is a pilot's control input in response to turbulence that creates the problem" (4.3.2). This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter may have encountered light to moderate turbulence in the valley (4.3.9), and the pilot's response to such conditions is a critical factor in the safety of flight.

Helicopter Maneuvering and Airspeed
The maneuvering and airspeed of the helicopter at the time of the accident are safety themes because they influence the likelihood of encountering a low-G situation that can lead to mast bumping. The report indicates that "the higher the speed, the greater is the risk of encountering a low-G situation" (4.3.26). In this accident, the helicopter's airspeed was at least 102 knots when the accident occurred (5.4), which is relevant because flying at high speeds increases the onset of low-G events and reduces the time for the pilot to respond appropriately (4.3.3).

Training and Awareness of Low-G Conditions
Training and awareness of low-G conditions are safety themes because they directly affect a pilot's ability to prevent and respond to situations that could lead to mast bumping. The report notes that in-flight demonstrations of low-G are prohibited for Robinson helicopters, yet there is evidence that some instructors in New Zealand have demonstrated the onset of the characteristic right roll that occurs in a low-G situation (4.3.14). This is relevant to the accident as it raises concerns about the adequacy of safety awareness training and the implementation of regulations designed to prevent low-G mast bumping accidents (4.3.32).

Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Performance
The performance of the ELT is a safety theme because it is crucial for guiding search and rescue efforts to an accident site, which can be the difference between survival and not in survivable accidents. In this case, the ELT was activated but torn from its mount, which led to a weaker signal that was not immediately detected by satellites (4.4.2). Although the accident was not survivable, the non-performance of the ELT is of interest as it highlights the need for reliable distress signaling devices, reinforcing the Commission's recommendations for improving the performance of ELTs (4.4.4).
Themes for 2014_102: 
Human Performance Limitations
Human performance limitations are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the driver's performance was likely impaired due to the time of day and the length of his shift. The accident occurred "during early morning when human performance is typically at its lowest and when the driver was nearing the end of a nine-hour shift" (4.1.15, 5.3). These factors are known to affect alertness and decision-making, which in this case may have led to the driver not responding correctly to the trackside signals.

Signalling System Comprehension
Signalling system comprehension is a safety theme because the train driver did not respond to the signals indicating the train was being directed through the Westfield crossover. The driver had "assumed that his train would be directed back to the Otahuhu yard via a path that he was used to" and as a result, "either did not look at, or saw but did not comprehend the significance of, the three preceding signals and one route indicator" (4.1.14, 4.1.15). This indicates a potential issue with how drivers interpret and act upon signal information.

Lack of System Defences
Lack of system defences is a safety theme because at the time of the accident, there were no automatic safeguards in place to prevent an accident if a train driver failed to react correctly to signals. The report states that "the rail system at the time of the accident had no defences in place to mitigate an accident occurring if a train driver did not react correctly to the trackside signals" (4.2, 5.4). This lack of a fail-safe system increased the risk of human error leading to an accident.

Fatigue Management
Fatigue management is a safety theme because the driver's state of fatigue could have contributed to the accident. Although the report suggests that "it is unlikely that fatigue was a factor in the accident" based on the driver's roster and comments (4.1.9), the driver did report feeling tired at the end of his shift (4.1.11). This highlights the importance of managing fatigue in safety-critical roles.

Training and Familiarization
Training and familiarization are safety themes because the driver's expectation based on his experience and training may have influenced his actions. The driver was familiar with the Auckland rail network and had been trained only on the push-pull train type (4.1.6). His expectation that the train would take the usual route may have caused him to overlook the signals directing him otherwise (4.1.15). This suggests that training should include preparing drivers for unexpected route changes.

Communication and Information Sharing
Communication and information sharing are safety themes because the accident could potentially have been prevented if the train controller had communicated the route change to the driver. The report indicates that "additional advice to train drivers about conditions that are likely to affect their trains can help to prevent accidents" (4.3.9). The lack of clear policy and procedures for train controllers to provide route information to drivers is highlighted as an issue (5.6).
Themes for 2014_103: 
Low Rail Adhesion
Low rail adhesion is a safety theme that refers to the reduced friction between train wheels and the rail, which can significantly increase the stopping distance of a train. This theme is relevant to the accident because "low rail-adhesion conditions existed in both of the Melling accidents" (4.1.2), and the wheel-slide protection activities were recorded by the train data loggers, indicating that the trains encountered low adhesion on the tracks. Furthermore, the analysis concluded that "an extended period of dry weather combined with the formation of dew on the rail resulted in a condition of low rail adhesion along the approach to the station" (5.1), which directly impacted the ability of the trains to stop effectively.

Train Brake System Performance
Train brake system performance is a safety theme that encompasses the effectiveness and reliability of a train's braking system, especially under varying conditions. This theme is crucial to the accident as the analysis showed that "a factor contributing to each accident was that the train braking system did not perform as well as it could have in the low-adhesion conditions" (4.1.5). The National Rail System Standards did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard, leading to the train brake system not being optimized for low-adhesion conditions (4.1.6). The subsequent tests revealed that the train brakes "were not performing as well as they could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for optimum braking in low-adhesion conditions" (5.5).

Driver Impairment and Training
Driver impairment and training is a safety theme that involves the physical and cognitive condition of the train driver, as well as the adequacy of their training for operating the train safely. This theme is relevant because the driver of the Melling 2 train tested positive for cannabis metabolites, and while it was not established whether his performance was impaired, "the use of performance-impairing substances by train drivers is a significant safety issue" (4.1.4). Additionally, the training provided to drivers transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type "did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems" (5.8), which could have affected their ability to respond appropriately in low-adhesion conditions.

Infrastructure Risk Management at Terminating Stations
Infrastructure risk management at terminating stations is a safety theme that deals with the design and management of station infrastructure to mitigate the risks of train overruns. This theme is relevant as the report identified that "the operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform at Melling Station and colliding with the stop block had not been adequately considered" (5.4). The stop block was an older design and less effective than modern equivalents, and the pole carrying the overhead traction power line was placed directly behind the stop block, making it prone to damage (4.3.3, 4.3.4).

National Rail System Standards
National Rail System Standards as a safety theme refers to the regulatory framework and standards that govern the rail system's safety requirements. This theme is significant to the accident because the standards "do not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer-controlled brake and wheel-slide protection systems" (5.7). The lack of specific requirements for low-adhesion braking performance in the standards meant that the Matangi trains' braking systems were not optimized for such conditions, which was a contributing factor to the accidents (4.4.11, 4.4.12).

Response to Emergency Situations
Response to emergency situations is a safety theme that involves the procedures and actions taken during an unexpected event, such as a train's brake failure. This theme is relevant as the report indicates that after the Melling 2 accident, the traction controller at the Wellington National Train Control Centre reset the power before the driver could warn train control of the accident, highlighting a risk in promptly resetting the overhead power without establishing the reason for the system tripping (4.3.6). The operator also did not have a best practice for braking in an emergency, leaving it to the drivers' discretion, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially unsafe responses during critical moments (4.5.5, 4.5.6).
Themes for 2010_204: 
Mechanical Reliability and Maintenance
Mechanical reliability and maintenance is a safety theme that involves ensuring that all machinery and equipment on a vessel are functioning correctly and are well maintained to prevent failures that could lead to accidents. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because the automatic main engine slowdown and shutdown events were caused by high cooling-water temperature, which was most likely caused by the malfunction of a 3-way valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water ("The automatic main engine slowdown and shutdown events were caused by high cooling-water temperature, which was most likely caused by the malfunction of a 3-way valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water" (5.1)). The malfunction of this critical component of the engine's cooling system directly contributed to the loss of propulsion and the subsequent grounding of the vessel.

Crew Resource Management
Crew resource management refers to the effective use of all available personnel, their skills, and information to achieve safe and efficient operations. This theme is highly relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident as the standard of crew resource management on board fell well short of international industry best practice, which could have prevented the grounding despite the main engine cooling-water problem ("The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay fell well short of international industry best practice" (5.5)). Furthermore, the master's failure to use English, the official working language of the ship, during the emergency, left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware of the issue they were dealing with, which contributed to the grounding ("The master not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging with the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency management protocols" (5.9)).

Communication Protocols
Communication protocols encompass the methods and standards for information exchange among crew members and between the ship and port authorities to ensure that everyone involved is aware of the situation and can act accordingly. This safety theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because better communication about the developing situation within the bridge team and between the bridge and engine room could have prevented the grounding through the better use of engines, tugs, and anchors ("Better communication about the developing situation within the bridge team and between the bridge and engine room could have prevented the Hanjin Bombay grounding" (5.4)). The lack of effective communication was a key factor that led to the vessel running aground.

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management involve identifying potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate the associated risks. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management system did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel ("Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management system did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel" (5.11)). The oversight in the risk assessment process contributed to the lack of preparedness for such an eventuality.

Use of Tug Escorts
The use of tug escorts is a safety measure that provides additional maneuvering capability and redundancy to a vessel, especially during critical operations such as entering or leaving a port. This safety theme is relevant because the grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive or active escort role ("The grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive or active escort role" (5.10)). The premature release of the tugs, without considering the vessel's condition and the critical phase of the operation, was a contributing factor to the accident.

Emergency Response Preparedness
Emergency response preparedness refers to the readiness of the crew and the vessel to respond effectively to emergencies. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because the facility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to override the automatic main engine shutdown, which might have prevented the vessel from running aground ("The facility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to override the automatic main engine shutdown, which might have resulted in damage to the main engine but probably would have prevented the vessel running aground" (5.3)). The lack of decisive action to use the override facility indicates a lack of preparedness to deal with the emergency situation.
Themes for 2014_004: 
Pilot Decision Making and Maneuvering at Low Altitude
Pilot decision making and maneuvering at low altitude is a critical safety theme as it involves the judgment and actions taken by a pilot when operating an aircraft close to the ground. In this accident, the pilot's decision to perform a low-level maneuver to clear livestock from an airstrip resulted in an aerodynamic stall from which recovery was not possible due to insufficient altitude ("The aeroplane stalled in a turn performed at low level during a stock-clearing manoeuvre" (5.3)). The pilot's decision to turn at low level instead of climbing straight ahead to a safer altitude after the initial pass over the airstrip was a key factor in the accident ("instead of climbing straight ahead after flying along the airstrip he turned at low level in order to make another low-level pass over the airstrip" (4.6.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Stall Recognition and Recovery Training
Stall recognition and recovery training is a safety theme that focuses on a pilot's ability to identify and respond to conditions that may lead to an aerodynamic stall. In this accident, the lack of an aural stall warning may have contributed to the pilot not recognizing the impending stall in time to take corrective action ("The lack of an aural stall warning may have been a factor that prevented the pilot recognising an impending stall and taking action to avoid it" (4.5.10)). This highlights the importance of training pilots to recognize the signs of a stall and to execute recovery procedures effectively, especially during critical phases of flight such as low-level maneuvering.

Fuel Management Procedures
Fuel management procedures are a safety theme that involves ensuring the aircraft has sufficient fuel for the intended operation and managing fuel distribution during flight. Although not a contributing factor in this accident, the pilot's management of the fuel system was thoroughly investigated and found to be in accordance with the operator's procedures ("the pilot's management of the fuel system was considered to have been in accordance with the operator's procedures and was not a contributing factor" (4.3.7)). Proper fuel management is crucial for preventing fuel starvation and ensuring the aircraft can reach its destination or an alternate landing site if necessary.

Operator Procedures and Training
Operator procedures and training is a safety theme that encompasses the guidelines provided by an aviation operator to its pilots and the training conducted to ensure competency in various maneuvers. In this accident, the operator did not have written procedures or guidelines on how to carry out stock clearing, nor had they provided flight instruction or assessed pilot competency in this maneuver ("The operator did not have any written procedures for or guidelines on how to carry out stock clearing" (4.5.16)). This lack of formal guidance and training may have contributed to the pilot's decision to perform a low-level turn that led to the stall.

Regulatory Clarity and Compliance
Regulatory clarity and compliance is a safety theme that involves understanding and adhering to the rules and regulations governing aviation operations. In this accident, there was a lack of clarity on whether stock clearing was a permissible activity under the Civil Aviation Rules, which may have influenced the pilot's decision to perform the low-level maneuver ("There was a lack of clarity on whether stock clearing was a permissible activity under the Civil Aviation Rules" (5.5)). Ensuring that pilots and operators are aware of and comply with regulations is essential for maintaining safety standards.

Aircraft Equipment and Warning Systems
Aircraft equipment and warning systems are a safety theme that focuses on the availability and functionality of systems designed to alert pilots to potential hazards. In this accident, the aircraft was not equipped with an aural stall warning system, which may have delayed the pilot's recognition of the stall condition ("A warning horn could have immediately drawn his attention to the impending stall" (4.5.10)). The presence of appropriate warning systems can provide critical alerts to pilots, allowing them to take timely corrective action to prevent accidents.
Themes for 2018_204: 
Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk elements (pilot, aircraft, environment, and type of operation) that affect safety before, during, and after the flight. In the case of the Dolphin Seeker, the skipper "lost situational awareness" and did not realize the vessel was navigating close to rocks until it ran aground on them (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because maintaining situational awareness is crucial for safe navigation, and the skipper's distraction due to multitasking significantly compromised this, leading to the grounding.

Distraction Due to Multitasking
Distraction due to multitasking occurs when an individual's attention is split between multiple tasks, which can lead to errors in performing safety-critical operations. The skipper of the Dolphin Seeker became distracted by "the simultaneous tasks of following the pod of dolphins and giving the passenger commentary" (4.1.2), which led to a failure to monitor the vessel's proximity to navigation hazards. This theme is relevant as it highlights the risks associated with performing concurrent tasks that can detract from the primary responsibility of ensuring navigational safety.

Lone Working in High-Risk Situations
Lone working in high-risk situations refers to scenarios where an individual is working alone in an environment where there are significant safety risks, without immediate support from colleagues. The skipper was "effectively working alone in a high-risk situation" (5.2), with no one else in the wheelhouse to prompt or assist them. This theme is relevant because the absence of additional crew in the wheelhouse removed a potential layer of defense against single-person errors that could have prevented the accident.

Use of Electronic Navigation Aids
The use of electronic navigation aids is a safety theme that involves the effective utilization of technology to enhance navigation safety. In this incident, the skipper did not "routinely use them to full effect" (4.3.4), and there were features of the electronic navigation aids on board that, if utilized, "could have prevented this grounding" (5.3). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of not only having safety equipment on board but also ensuring that it is used correctly and routinely to mitigate risks.

Safety Management Systems
Safety management systems (SMS) are comprehensive, systematic approaches to managing safety risks. The analysis indicated that the operator's safety management system "did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions" (4.1.3). This theme is relevant because an effective SMS should identify and mitigate all potential risks, including those associated with vessel navigation and operations. The failure to address specific risks can lead to accidents, as was the case with the Dolphin Seeker.

Operator's Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Operator's risk assessment and mitigation involves the processes by which an operator identifies potential hazards and implements measures to reduce the associated risks. The operator had identified the risk of skippers becoming distracted by giving commentary but had "only really identified the risk in certain situations" (4.2.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the need for comprehensive risk assessments that consider all operational scenarios, not just specific or common situations, to ensure that all potential hazards are mitigated.

Pilot incapacitation refers to a situation where a pilot is unable to perform their duties due to a medical or other condition. This theme is relevant to the accident because the investigation found it "about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25). The lack of any corrective action by the pilot, such as discontinuing the take-off or correcting the take-off path, suggests that the pilot may have been incapacitated and therefore unable to perform such actions (3.21, 3.22). The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of the pilot attempting to take remedial action during the take-off sequence, which would be expected from a well-trained and experienced agricultural pilot (3.24).

Mechanical Failure
Mechanical failure encompasses any malfunction or breakdown of aircraft components that can lead to an accident. In this case, the theme is relevant because the investigation considered the possibility of mechanical failure as a causal factor. However, it was determined that the engine was "delivering full power during the take-off roll and at the time of impact" (3.9), and there was no evidence of a failure in the aircraft's systems, such as flight controls or steering (3.10). The undercarriage was dislodged due to a high-impact event during the accident sequence, not as a causal factor (3.11). Thus, mechanical failure was not deemed a contributing factor in this accident, but it was a critical area of investigation.

Airstrip Suitability
Airstrip suitability refers to the appropriateness of an airstrip for the operations being conducted, including its condition and any potential hazards. This theme is relevant because the investigation assessed the airstrip's condition. Witness evidence indicated that the airstrip was suitable for agricultural operations on the day of the accident, and the pilot had not expressed any concerns about the airstrip during the previous flights that day (3.18). The airstrip's suitability was confirmed by another agricultural pilot who considered it a typical farm airstrip with no unusual hazards or challenges (3.18).

Pilot Training and Competency
Pilot training and competency are critical for ensuring that pilots can handle the aircraft and any situations that may arise during flight. This theme is relevant because the pilot in the accident was experienced in agricultural operations and the specific type of aircraft involved (3.15). The pilot had also demonstrated the ability to jettison loads when necessary and had done so in the past (3.16). The investigation found that training and competency were not considered causal factors in this accident (3.17), indicating that the pilot's training and experience were sufficient for the operations being conducted.

Overload
Overload in aviation can refer to the aircraft being over its weight capacity, which can affect its performance and handling. This theme is relevant because the investigation verified the load carried by the aircraft and confirmed that the load on the accident flight was the same as in the previous two flights, and the aircraft would have been lighter on the third take-off due to fuel consumption (3.13). A weight-and-balance calculation confirmed that the aircraft was within flight manual limits (3.14), indicating that overload was not a contributing factor to the accident.

Organisational Influences
Organisational influences include the policies, procedures, and culture within an aviation organization that can impact safety. This theme is relevant because the investigation examined the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals for any historical or systemic issues that could have been relevant to or causal factors in this accident (3.19). No such issues were identified, suggesting that the organisational influences did not contribute to the accident. However, this theme is important as it addresses the broader context in which the accident occurred.
Themes for 2014_203: 
Rope Management and Inspection
Rope management and inspection is a critical safety theme as it involves the procedures for maintaining, inspecting, and retiring ropes that are essential for the safe operation of a vessel. In the case of the Captain M. J. Souza, the rope management plan was inadequate, as evidenced by the fact that "the choker line broke, partly because it was in a deteriorated condition caused by extreme cyclic tension (fatigue) and some degree of abrasion" (5.1). Furthermore, there was "no formal recording or registering of ropes on board the Captain M. J. Souza and there was no requirement to do so" (4.3.1), indicating a lack of systematic approach to rope management. The absence of a robust rope management plan contributed to the accident, as the crew was unable to effectively monitor the condition of the ropes and make informed decisions about their use and retirement.

Fatigue Damage and Material Weakening
Fatigue damage and material weakening is a safety theme that relates to the degradation of materials used in critical operations, such as ropes on a fishing vessel. The accident analysis revealed that "the breaking load tests conducted on the choker line showed that the realized breaking strength of the choker line may have been as low as 6,700 kg, which is significantly lower than the typical 52,700 kg breaking strength of a new 50.8 mm double-braided nylon rope" (4.2.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This significant reduction in strength was attributed to fatigue damage, where "the material, in this case a fibre rope, typically fails at an intensity considerably below its normal breaking strength" (4.2.3). The failure of the choker line due to fatigue damage was a direct contributor to the accident, highlighting the importance of understanding and mitigating material weakening in safety-critical components.

Knots and Splices Integrity
The integrity of knots and splices is a safety theme that focuses on the proper construction and maintenance of connections within ropes, which are vital for the ropes' load-bearing capacity. In this accident, "the bowline knot on the choker line may have considerably reduced the strength of an already weakened rope" (4.2.6), and "the sling failed at the splice" (4.2.8). The use of a bowline knot, which can reduce the strength of a rope by up to 70%, and the failure of the splice, which was not constructed according to industry guidelines, were both factors that contributed to the accident. Ensuring the integrity of knots and splices is crucial to maintaining the overall strength and reliability of ropes used in maritime operations.

Safety Management System Implementation
The implementation of a safety management system (SMS) is a safety theme that encompasses the procedures and practices put in place to ensure safe operations. In the case of the Captain M. J. Souza, although the SMS provided "good guidelines for the management and use of ropes on board," it was found that "neither the crew nor the skipper nor shore management were ensuring that the safety management system was being adequately followed" (5.5). The lack of adherence to the SMS guidelines, such as the failure to replace a deteriorated choker line and the improper positioning of crew during operations (4.4.9), indicates that the SMS was not effectively implemented, which is a safety concern that contributed to the accident.

Crew Training and Familiarity with Equipment
Crew training and familiarity with equipment is a safety theme that involves ensuring that all crew members are knowledgeable about the tools and procedures they work with. The Safe Working Practices document required crewmembers to be familiar with "the breaking characteristics of synthetic ropes" and to ensure that "ropes in use are in good condition and have strength appropriate to their applications" (4.4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). However, the accident revealed that the crew did not adequately inspect the ropes or recognize the signs of deterioration, suggesting a gap in training or familiarity with the equipment. This lack of knowledge and proper training was a contributing factor to the accident.

Load Testing and Material Quality Assurance
Load testing and material quality assurance is a safety theme that deals with verifying the strength and quality of materials used in operations. The choker line's breaking strength was found to be much lower than expected, and "the reported new sample rope of similar construction were removed from on board for testing and examination" (4.3.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The tests showed that even the sample rope, which appeared to be in relatively good condition, had only about 40% of the expected breaking load (4.3.5). This indicates a potential issue with the quality assurance of the materials used, as well as the necessity for load testing to ensure that equipment meets safety standards. The lack of proper testing and quality assurance of the ropes likely contributed to the accident.
Themes for 2019_005: 
NVG Illusions and Spatial Disorientation
The theme of NVG illusions and spatial disorientation is highly relevant to this accident as the pilot was likely deceived by a visual illusion commonly experienced over calm water, which can affect judgment of height and spatial orientation when using Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). This illusion led to a loss of vertical reference and resulted in a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident. The document states, "the pilot met the minimum recency requirement for NVG operations, but was likely deceived by a well-documented visual illusion with NVGs caused by a low contrast surface" (4.5). Furthermore, it is mentioned that "it is commonly experienced over calm water and can affect judgment of height and spatial orientation" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), indicating the direct impact of NVG illusions on the accident.

Inadequate Regulatory Framework for NVIS Operations
The theme of an inadequate regulatory framework for Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) operations is pertinent to this accident as the existing regulations and risk controls defined by the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and NVIS operations were found to be outdated and not fit for purpose. The investigation found that "The New Zealand CAA risk controls that define the minimum safety requirements for HAA and NVIS operations significantly lag other jurisdictions and are no longer fit for purpose" (4.8). This indicates that the regulatory environment did not provide sufficient guidance or performance expectations to manage the risks associated with NVIS operations effectively.

Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training Deficiencies
The theme of Crew Resource Management (CRM) training deficiencies is relevant to this accident due to the lack of comprehensive CRM training qualifications for non-pilot crew members acting as NVIS crew. The investigation highlighted that "The potential for CRM to be an effective risk control with non-pilot NVIS crew members in a single-pilot, VFR, Part 135 operation is undermined by the current rule" (4.10). The document also states that "CAR Part 135 does not set a clear expectation about the role and duties of a non-pilot NVIS crew member, or define an appropriate level of CRM competence that could contribute to the safety of an NVIS flight" (4.10). This indicates that the CRM training was not adequate to ensure effective communication and decision-making during the flight.

Overloading of the Helicopter
The theme of overloading the helicopter is relevant as the aircraft departed for the flight in an overloaded condition, exceeding the maximum certified weight limit by approximately 300 kg. This is a significant safety factor as it can affect the aircraft's performance and handling characteristics. The report states, "The helicopter departed for this flight in an overloaded condition, exceeding the maximum certified weight limit by almost 300 kg" (4.12). Overloading is a known risk that can have serious implications for flight safety.

Inadequate Emergency Equipment Accessibility
The theme of inadequate emergency equipment accessibility is relevant to this accident as the crew, despite being provided with appropriate emergency survival equipment, were unable to locate some of this equipment after the helicopter impacted the sea. The report notes, "Although the helicopter and crew were provided with the appropriate emergency survival equipment and crew training for this operation, they were unable to locate some of this equipment, despite it being accessible" (4.13). This indicates that the placement and accessibility of emergency equipment were not optimal for use in an actual emergency situation.

Lack of Aural Alerting Function on Radio Altimeter
The lack of an aural alerting function on the radio altimeter is a relevant safety theme as it is a recognized safety measure for NVIS operations that could have potentially alerted the pilot to the helicopter's proximity to the sea surface. The investigation found that "the aircraft's radio altimeter was not required to be fitted with an aural alerting function. This function provides significant safety protections for pilots wearing NVGs" (4.9). The absence of such an alert could have contributed to the pilot's lack of awareness of the helicopter's altitude, leading to the CFIT accident.
Themes for 2013_105: 
Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as there was no effective means for the train attendant, who was operating the mobility hoist, to communicate with the train manager. This lack of communication contributed to the premature departure of the train with passengers still on the mobility hoist. The report states, "there was no means provided for the train attendant in the luggage van to communicate with the train manager near the front of the train" (4.2) and "there was no effective means for the train attendant who was operating the mobility hoist to communicate with the train manager" (5.1). This theme is relevant because effective communication is essential to ensure that all safety checks are completed before a train departs.

Procedural Non-Compliance
Procedural non-compliance is another safety theme, as the operation of the mobility hoist was not included in the train manager's pre-departure checks, nor was it written into the departure procedure. The report highlights that "the stowing of the mobility hoist and securing of the luggage van doors did not feature in the train manager's pre-departure checks" (4.2) and "the operation of the mobility hoist had not been written into the departure procedure being followed by the train manager" (5.1). This theme is relevant because adherence to comprehensive procedures is crucial for the safe operation of trains, especially when dealing with passengers requiring special assistance.

Reliance on Human Memory
Reliance on human memory is a significant safety theme, as the train manager was expected to remember the stations where passengers in wheelchairs were to alight and to communicate effectively with the train attendant. The report indicates that "the operation of the mobility hoist relied on the train manager knowing and/or remembering the stations at which any passengers in wheelchairs were to alight" (4.4) and acknowledges that "human memory can be influenced by a number of factors" (4.6). This theme is relevant because relying solely on human memory for critical safety tasks is unreliable and can lead to errors.

Visibility Issues
Visibility issues played a role in this accident, as the train manager could not easily see whether the mobility hoist was in use due to environmental conditions and the lack of high-visibility markings on the hoist. The report notes, "it would have been difficult for the train manager to see the mobility hoist even if it had been deployed onto the platform" (4.7) and "even if it had been deployed, it might not have been visible to the train manager due to the distance, the low ambient light conditions and the lack of high-visibility marking on the hoist" (5.2). This theme is relevant because the ability to visually confirm the status of equipment is essential for safe operations.

Inadequate Safety Systems
Inadequate safety systems are a theme, as the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system, which allowed the train manager to receive a green all-doors-closed signal despite the mobility hoist being deployed. The report states, "the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system" (4.2) and "the status of the luggage van doors was not interlocked with the train door status and control system" (5.1). This theme is relevant because the integration of safety systems is necessary to prevent human error and ensure all parts of the train are secure before departure.

Lack of Procedures for Special Equipment
The lack of procedures for the operation of special equipment, such as the mobility hoist, is a safety theme because KiwiRail did not have a procedure to cover its operation after the instructions had been removed from the Rail Operating Code. The report reveals, "KiwiRail did not have a procedure to cover the operation of the mobility hoist" (4.3). This theme is relevant because having clear, written procedures for the use of all equipment, especially those required for passengers with disabilities, is fundamental to ensuring safety and preventing accidents.
Themes for 2016_101: 
Congested Track Layout
The congested track layout at Wellington Station is a safety theme because it creates a heightened risk of trains colliding due to limited space, which makes the track layout congested. This congestion increases the complexity of train movements and signal recognition, contributing to the potential for accidents. The report states, "there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested" (4.1.2). Furthermore, the report mentions that "the congested nature of the Wellington Station track layout means there are fewer fail-safe back-up systems than would normally be associated with a modern track and signalling system" (5.3), highlighting the relevance of this theme to the accident.

Ineffective Non-Technical Skills
Ineffective non-technical skills (NTS) among the train crew, specifically between the driver, the Train Examiner Officer (TXO), and the signaller, is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The report identifies that "the standard of non-technical skills (NTS), formerly known as Crew Resource Management, between the driver, the TXO and the signaller were ineffective" (4.1.2). The lack of effective communication and coordination among the crew members contributed to the incident, as there was no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before departure (4.2.1), and no conversation reported between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train (4.2.7).

Signal Recognition and Procedures
Signal recognition and procedures are a safety theme because the relay train driver mistook a green signal meant for another train as his own, leading to the near-miss incident. The report indicates that "Instead of stopping his train at the Red signal 100 on his left, the driver of the relay train mistook the Green signal 99 on his right as being for his train" (4.2.4). Additionally, the report discusses the lack of standard procedures for signalling trains through the area and the absence of written guidelines for signallers on how early to pre-set routes (4.4.1, 4.4.6). This theme is relevant as it directly relates to the cause of the accident and the need for better signal recognition and standardized signalling procedures.

Human Error and System Defences
Human error and the lack of system defences to counteract it is a safety theme that is relevant to this accident. The driver's mistake is considered a lapse, possibly due to reduced awareness at the end of his shift (4.2.9). The report emphasizes the importance of having checks or defences in a system to counteract the known risk of human error (4.2.10). The incident demonstrates that the current system was highly reliant on drivers always stopping at a Red light, without sufficient fail-safe mechanisms to prevent a collision in the event of human error (4.3.4).

Communication Protocols
Communication protocols, or the lack thereof, are a safety theme because the absence of effective communication between the train driver and the signaller contributed to the incident. The report notes that there had been no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed (4.2.1), and that better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains could have reduced the risk of collision (4.1.2). The need for improved communication is further highlighted by the suggestion that holding a relay at the platform with a Red signal until the driver is on board would necessitate a call to the signaller to request a light to depart, thereby improving the exchange of critical information (4.4.8).

Infrastructure Modernization and Safety Features
Infrastructure modernization and the implementation of safety features are safety themes because the report identifies the need for modernizing the track and signal infrastructure to reduce the risk of collisions. The Wellington Signalbox controlled area is based on 1930s' vintage signalling principles and lacks modern safety features such as safety overlaps and Automatic Train Protection (4.3.4). The report suggests that to install a system like the European Train Control System (ETCS), a substantial remodel of the current layout would be required to facilitate the necessary safety overlaps (4.3.11). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that the incident occurred within an outdated infrastructure that was not equipped with modern safety features to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such accidents.
Themes for 2019_007: 
Redundancy in Power Supply Systems
Redundancy in power supply systems is a safety theme that involves having multiple independent systems to ensure continuous operation in the event of a failure. This theme is relevant to the accident because the aeronautical telecommunications network equipment at Christchurch ATMC was designed with two independent generator-backed power supply systems, system A and system B, to provide resilience. However, the failure of a capacitor in UPS A and the incorrect power connection of the MPLS network equipment resulted in a complete loss of power when it should have been supported by the redundant system B ("The redundancy in power supply systems was so designed that if one power supply system failed, the equipment would continue to operate from the other power supply system" (3.5), "When power supply system A stopped providing power to the aeronautical telecommunications network equipment, power supply system B should have taken over" (3.12)).

Maintenance Checks and Procedures
Maintenance checks and procedures are critical for ensuring the continued safety and reliability of equipment. This theme is relevant to the accident as the Commission identified a safety issue related to the lack of maintenance checks of essential equipment at Christchurch ATMC. Airways had intended to conduct annual UPS power outage checks but did not perform them as required, which would have likely exposed the incorrect power connection issue and prevented the outage ("The Commission identified one safety issue related to maintenance checks of essential equipment" (3.4), "Airways had not conducted the required maintenance checks on their aeronautical telecommunications network equipment in accordance with their preventative maintenance action procedures" (3.20)).

Risk Management and Mitigation
Risk management and mitigation involve identifying potential risks and implementing measures to prevent or minimize their impact. This theme is relevant to the accident because Airways technicians were aware that the type of capacitors used were prone to failure and had a procedure to replace them within the manufacturer's recommended lifetime. Despite this, a failure still occurred, and the risk was not adequately mitigated due to incorrect power connections that had not been identified or corrected ("Airways technicians were aware that they are prone to occasional premature failure" (3.8), "If Airways had conducted the UPS power outage checks, it would have exposed the incorrect power connection issue" (3.23)).

Equipment Installation and Configuration
Proper equipment installation and configuration are essential to ensure that systems function as intended, especially in safety-critical environments. This theme is relevant to the accident as the MPLS and IPMux network equipment were incorrectly connected to the power supply systems since installation, which contributed to the failure of the redundant power supply system during the outage ("both power supply system connections for the MPLS equipment were plugged into UPS A electrical power outlet distribution" (3.12), "The incorrect power connections to the MPLS and IPMux network equipment had likely existed since installation" (4.4)).

Organizational Oversight and Compliance
Organizational oversight and compliance with established procedures and standards are crucial for maintaining safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because Airways' management deferred the UPS power outage checks in 2018 and 2019, believing that conducting the checks posed a greater risk than not performing them. This decision went against their own preventative maintenance procedures and ultimately led to the outage not being prevented ("Airways' management deferred the UPS power outage checks in 2018 and 2019" (3.22), "Airways had not carried out the required preventative maintenance power outage checks" (4.5)).

Technological Upgrades and Standards
Implementing technological upgrades and adhering to current standards is a safety theme that ensures systems are up-to-date and capable of meeting operational demands. This theme is relevant to the accident because, in 2018, Airways introduced a new cabling standard that used color-coded cables for UPS A and UPS B to prevent confusion. However, the IPMux cabinets involved in the incident had not been updated to this standard, contributing to the incorrect power connections ("in 2018 they introduced a new cabling standard that ensured ups power cables were color coded for ups a and ups b" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The IPMux cabinets involved with this incident at the Christchurch ATMC had not been brought up to this standard" (3.18)).
Themes for 2010_203: 
Maintenance of Safety-Critical Systems
Maintenance of safety-critical systems is a key safety theme in this accident. The CO2 fire-fighting system on the Marsol Pride was a safety-critical system designed to minimize the effects of a fire in the engine room ("Ships‟ engine rooms contain various machinery installations that provide sources of fuel and ignition for a fire; consequently the risk of a fire occurring is high" (4.1.1)). The incident occurred due to failures in the maintenance and testing of this system, specifically the booster valve which was critical to the system's integrity ("The integrity of the booster valve was critical to the integrity of the complete system" (4.3.3)). The failure of this valve was caused by a combination of corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal ("The failure of the valve was caused by a combination of corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal" (5.3)).

Inspection and Testing Procedures
Inspection and testing procedures are another safety theme related to this accident. The report highlights that the integrity of a fixed CO2 fire-fighting system cannot be assured with only a requirement to inspect control valves every 5 years, without periodic pressure testing ("The integrity of a fixed CO2 fire-fighting system cannot be assured when the only requirement is to inspect control valves every 5 years, with no requirement to pressure test them periodically" (5.4)). This suggests that the existing inspection and testing procedures were insufficient to detect the deterioration in the valve performance, which led to the incident.

Risk of Uncontrolled System Activation
The risk of uncontrolled system activation is a safety theme that is central to this accident. The report states that an uncontrolled or unplanned activation of a ship's fixed CO2 fire smothering system is a serious event because it can cause harm to crew members and could immobilize the ship at a critical time ("An uncontrolled or unplanned activation of a ship‟s fixed CO2 fire smothering system is a serious event because it can cause serious harm to crew members and could immobilise the ship at a critical time of its operation or voyage" (5.1)). The inadvertent release of CO2 in the Marsol Pride's engine room was due to the successive and independent failure of two valves, which was an uncontrolled event with serious implications ("An uncontrolled release of CO2 gas into the Marsol Pride‟s engine room occurred owing to the successive and independent failure of 2 valves in the fixed CO2 fire-fighting system" (5.2)).

Human Factors and System Design
Human factors and system design are relevant to this accident as the design of the CO2 system and the actions of the crew in response to the system's activation are important considerations. The report notes that the engine room was not sealed off because there was no fire and it was not the crew's intention to activate the CO2 system ("In this case the supply fans were stopped automatically, but the engine room was not sealed off because there was no fire and it was not the crew‟s intention to activate the CO2 system" (4.2.8)). This indicates that the system's design and the crew's interaction with it during an emergency are critical for safety.

Corrosion and Material Degradation
Corrosion and material degradation are significant safety themes in this accident. The report identifies that the brass booster valve piston and valve seat had been attacked by corrosion in the form of de-zincification, which contributed to the valve's failure ("The laboratory examination revealed that the brass booster valve piston and valve seat had been attacked by corrosion in the form of de-zincification" (4.3.6)). This highlights the importance of material selection and corrosion prevention in the maintenance of safety-critical systems.

Adequacy of Safety Regulations
The adequacy of safety regulations is a theme that emerges from the report's findings. The report suggests that the existing regulations, which required control valves to be internally inspected at least every 5 years, may not be sufficient to ensure the safety of critical systems like the CO2 fire-fighting system ("The IMO guidelines say that control valves should be internally inspected at least every 5 years, which might be sufficient, provided that such valves are tested under operational pressure at more frequent intervals" (4.3.8)). This indicates a need to review and potentially enhance safety regulations to prevent similar incidents.
Themes for 2016_008: 
Fuel Contamination
Fuel contamination is a critical safety theme as it directly impacts engine performance and reliability. In this accident, contaminated fuel was identified as the primary cause of the momentary reduction in engine power, which led to the low rotor RPM condition and ultimately the accident. The analysis found that "contaminants were found in: the fuel filter housing, the fuel hose assembly running to the fuel nozzle, and the fuel nozzle itself" (4.2.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Furthermore, the fuel sample recovered was "a muddy brown colour" indicating contamination that could have "temporarily restricted the fuel flow through the spray tip assembly within the fuel nozzle" (4.2.18). This theme is relevant because the helicopter's engine performance was compromised due to contaminated fuel, which was a direct contributor to the accident.

Fuel Handling Procedures
Fuel handling procedures are a significant safety theme as improper handling can introduce contaminants into the fuel system, leading to engine performance issues. In this case, the operator's refueling procedures "left several opportunities for fuel contamination" (4.3.6). The frequent refueling cycles in a dusty environment increased the risk of fuel becoming contaminated (4.3.13). Moreover, there were "three fuel contamination occurrences in a 15-month period" which suggests that there were opportunities to improve the operator's fuel handling practices (4.3.16). This theme is relevant because lapses in fuel handling procedures contributed to the fuel contamination that caused the accident.

Engine Power Management
Engine power management is a crucial safety theme as it involves the ability of the aircraft's systems to maintain and control engine power output under varying conditions. During the accident, the engine's power turbine governor and fuel control unit failed to correct a decrease in output shaft RPM due to contaminated fuel, as "the expected corresponding increase in the gas temperature did not immediately occur" (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because the inability to manage and maintain engine power was a contributing factor to the low rotor RPM and the subsequent accident.

Pilot Response to Emergency Situations
Pilot response to emergency situations is a key safety theme, as the pilot's actions during an unexpected event can significantly influence the outcome. In this incident, the pilot was forced to attempt a run-on landing when faced with a low rotor RPM situation (4.1.1). The pilot's decision-making and actions during the emergency were critical to the outcome. This theme is relevant because the pilot's response to the low rotor RPM warning was a direct result of the momentary loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.

Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection
Aircraft maintenance and inspection are vital safety themes, as they ensure the aircraft's systems and components are functioning correctly and are free from defects that could lead to an accident. The investigation found no mechanical defects in the engine, power turbine governor, or fuel control unit that could have prevented normal operation (4.2.7). However, the sprag clutch was examined to determine if pre-existing damage contributed to the decrease in rotor RPM (4.4.1). This theme is relevant because the integrity of the aircraft's components, ensured through proper maintenance and inspection, is essential for safe operation.

Operator's Safety Culture and Practices
The operator's safety culture and practices are a safety theme that encompasses the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. In this case, the lack of documented procedures, guidance material, and recorded training for handling aviation fuels indicates a gap in the operator's safety practices (4.3.16). The operator's approach to managing fuel contamination risks and the absence of a proactive safety culture contributed to the accident. This theme is relevant because an operator's commitment to safety can significantly reduce the risk of accidents.
Themes for 2011_104: 
Vehicle Dimensions and Compatibility with Infrastructure
The theme of vehicle dimensions and compatibility with infrastructure is highly relevant to this accident because the bus involved complied with the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass, yet it became stuck at the level crossing due to the road profile and the intersection's design. "the bus complied with all aspects of the land transport rule: vehicle dimensions and mass" (4.2.6), but "the profile of the Beach Road level crossing and the adjacent section of road leading up to the intersection with State Highway 1 were not well suited for long and low road vehicles" (5.2). This indicates that while the bus met regulatory standards, the infrastructure was not suitable for its dimensions, leading to the accident.

Stacking Distances at Level Crossings
Stacking distances at level crossings are a critical safety theme because the accident occurred when the bus could not clear the rail level crossing while waiting at the intersection. "The Beach Road/State Highway 1 intersection did not have a sufficient stacking distance to accommodate this bus, and any other road vehicle over about 10 m in length, without those vehicles encroaching on the rail corridor at the Beach Road level crossing" (5.4). This shows that the design of the intersection did not provide enough space for longer vehicles to wait safely without obstructing the railway, directly contributing to the collision.

Emergency Response Procedures
Emergency response procedures are a significant safety theme as the collision could have been prevented if the bus driver had known how to contact train control and had done so immediately. "The collision could have been prevented if the bus driver had known how to contact train control, and had immediately done so" (5.7). The lack of knowledge and accessibility to emergency contact information for the train control center was a contributing factor to the accident.

Road and Rail Regulatory Interface
The road and rail regulatory interface is a pertinent safety theme because the accident highlighted the need for better coordination between road vehicle standards and rail infrastructure. "Changes in the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass have been made with little formal consideration for the compatibility of long and low road vehicles with existing rail level crossings throughout New Zealand" (5.9). This theme underscores the importance of ensuring that changes in vehicle regulations are compatible with rail level crossing profiles to prevent such accidents.

Driver Awareness and Training
Driver awareness and training are crucial safety themes because the bus driver's assumption that no trains were running contributed to the accident. "Even though on this occasion the bus driver erroneously assumed that no trains were running, he could have contacted train control if the telephone number had been immediately to hand" (4.4.3). This theme suggests that drivers need to be better informed about the potential hazards and emergency procedures at level crossings.

Signage and Warning Systems
Signage and warning systems are essential safety themes as the lack of adequate signage warning drivers of long vehicles about the limited stacking distance at the level crossing was a safety issue. "Had this been considered as recommended in the Traffic Control Devices Manual, signage warning motorists should have been erected as a minimum" (4.2.6). Proper signage could have alerted the bus driver to the risks at the level crossing, potentially preventing the accident.
Themes for 2011_005: 
Engine Surge Management
Engine surge management is a critical safety theme as it pertains to the proper handling of engine stalls or surges, which can be alarming and potentially damaging. The document states that "modern engine design requirements and operating practices have reduced the frequency and severity of these events" (4.2) and that "provided pilots follow the prescribed flight manual procedures, as they did in these incidents, such events are not critical flight safety hazards" (4.3). This theme is relevant to the accident because the crew's correct response to the engine surge by shutting down the engine minimized further damage (4.8), and the San Francisco engineer's decision to release the airplane back to service after the initial surge was deemed appropriate (4.5).

Maintenance Standards for Aging Aircraft
The maintenance standards for aging aircraft is a pertinent safety theme, as it addresses concerns about whether the standard of maintenance declines as airplanes near the end of their service lives. The document questions if "the 3 in-flight shutdowns in a little over 4 months, although involving different airplane and engine types, indicate a reduction in the standard of maintenance of airplanes nearing the end of their service lives with the operator" (4.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). However, it was found that "there were no related circumstances and no evidence that the operator's maintenance practices contributed to any of the events" (5.4), indicating that maintenance standards were upheld despite the aircraft's age.

Predictability and Indicators of Engine Issues
Predictability and indicators of engine issues are a safety theme that involves the ability to foresee and detect potential engine problems before they result in incidents. The document highlights that "prior to the surge, the RB211 engine had been operating within its design performance limits and there had been no indication that a stall or surge could occur at either San Francisco or Auckland" (5.2). This theme is relevant because it underscores the challenges in predicting engine surges and the importance of having robust detection systems to prevent such unpredictable events.

Crew Response to Emergencies
Crew response to emergencies is a crucial safety theme, focusing on the actions taken by flight crew during unexpected events. In this incident, "the crew acted correctly in shutting down the engine to minimize further damage" (4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), demonstrating the importance of proper training and adherence to emergency procedures. This theme is relevant as the crew's response is a critical factor in ensuring the safety of the flight during an engine surge event.

Engine Performance Monitoring
Engine performance monitoring is a safety theme that involves the continuous assessment of engine functionality to ensure safe operation. The document mentions that after the San Francisco surge, "the airplane completed another 2 flights without incident, and engine performance data confirmed that the engine operated correctly during that time" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant to the accident as it highlights the role of ongoing engine performance assessments in validating the airworthiness of an aircraft after an incident.

Impact of Environmental Factors on Engine Performance
The impact of environmental factors on engine performance is a safety theme that considers how external conditions can affect engine behavior. The document suggests that the San Francisco event was likely a result of environmental influences on a high-time but serviceable engine (4.7). This theme is relevant to the accident as it acknowledges that environmental factors such as gusty winds and turbulence can contribute to engine stalls (4.4), and understanding these influences is essential for mitigating risks associated with engine performance.
Themes for 2019_101: 
Communication
Communication is a critical safety theme in this accident, as ineffective communication between the signals technician and the rail protection officer (RPO) led to a misunderstanding of the work being undertaken. The RPO "incorrectly assumed that the work was related to removing the secondary protection in preparation for handing the track back to train control" (3.8), and the signals technician did not clarify that the work on the points "could take some time" (3.10). This lack of clear communication resulted in the RPO not realizing the need to lock on the signals technician for safety, which was a contributing factor to the incident (3.16, 3.17).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is another key safety theme related to this accident. The RPO's situational awareness was compromised, as they were not fully aware of the signals technician's activities and believed the technician was working clear of the track (3.19). This misunderstanding led to the RPO advising train control that electronic blocking could be removed, which "potentially put the signals technician at risk from rail traffic" (3.11). The incident underscores the importance of maintaining situational awareness to ensure the safety of personnel working on or near the tracks (3.14, 3.19).

Adherence to Procedures
Adherence to procedures is a crucial safety theme in this incident. The RPO allowed the signals technician to enter the protected working area (PWA) without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902, which resulted in "a significant safety barrier was breached" (3.2). The failure to follow established safety procedures and protocols directly contributed to the unsafe conditions that led to the incident (3.12).

Non-Technical Skills
Non-technical skills, such as decision-making, cooperation, and workload management, are a safety theme that played a significant role in this accident. The report highlights that all key personnel involved had undergone training in non-technical skills, but the incident demonstrated a failure to effectively apply these skills in practice (3.15). The lack of effective use of non-technical skills, particularly in communication and situational awareness, contributed to the misunderstanding and procedural lapses that led to the incident (3.20).

Challenge and Response
The safety theme of challenge and response is relevant to this accident as there was a missed opportunity for the signals technician to challenge the RPO on the necessity to lock on (3.17). This challenge could have prompted a reassessment of the situation and potentially prevented the incident. The absence of an effective challenge and response mechanism in this scenario highlights a gap in safety practices that could have mitigated the risk (3.15, 3.17).

Training and Continuation Training
Training and continuation training in safety principles is a safety theme that is pertinent to this accident. Although all personnel involved had been trained in non-technical skills, the incident highlighted the need for ongoing training to ensure that these principles remain at the forefront of workers' minds (3.22). The failure to apply the training effectively in the field suggests that reinforcement and continuation training are necessary to maintain a high level of safety awareness and competence (3.15, 3.22).
Themes for 2011_007: 
Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures
Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is a critical safety theme as it ensures that all crew members are aligned with the expected actions and responses during flight operations, especially in emergency or non-standard situations. In this accident, the captain and first officer did not adhere to the company's SOPs for a "monitored approach" to the runway in poor meteorological conditions, which compromised the safety of the flight ("The captain and first officer did not adhere to company standard operating procedures for a 'monitored approach' to the runway in poor meteorological conditions" (4.2)). The captain failed to make the appropriate responses to automated calls prior to reaching the decision height, and the first officer did not challenge the captain for an appropriate response ("The captain did not make the appropriate response to two automated calls prior to the aeroplane reaching the point (decision height)" (5.1)). This non-compliance with SOPs eroded safety margins and contributed to the unsafe continuation of the approach.

Crew Communication and Coordination
Crew Communication and Coordination is a safety theme that focuses on the importance of clear and effective communication between all members of the flight crew to ensure safe flight operations. In this incident, there were multiple breakdowns in crew communication, such as the captain not acknowledging automated calls and the first officer not challenging the captain's lack of response ("The second breakdown in communication was the captain not acknowledging the next automated 'Plus hundred' call at 100 feet above decision height" (4.2.4)). The first officer's hesitation to challenge the captain may have been influenced by the captain's known minimalistic communication style and reputation for saying little on the flight deck ("The captain's communication style and his reputation could well have contributed to the observed breakdown in the communication loop during the approach to Christchurch" (4.2.15)).

Management of Flight Crew Performance
Management of Flight Crew Performance is a safety theme that involves the oversight and intervention by airline operators to ensure that their pilots are performing to the expected standards and adhering to procedures. In this case, the operator was aware of the captain's performance issues and tendency to not always follow standard communication procedures, but the informal method used to address the issue did not result in any measurable improvement ("the operator was aware of the captain's tendency over a period of at least three years to not always follow standard communication procedures" (4.3.4)). The lack of formal action by the company could have shown tacit acceptance of the captain's non-conforming practices, allowing them to continue virtually unchallenged ("The operator had not followed its own procedures for managing the previously identified performance issues with the captain" (5.6)).

Stress and Cognitive Functioning
Stress and Cognitive Functioning is a safety theme that recognizes the impact of stress on a pilot's ability to perform necessary tasks and make critical decisions during flight. The captain in this incident was likely operating under a level of stress that interfered with his cognitive functioning, as evidenced by his failure to initiate a missed approach when required ("The only appropriate decision was for the captain to commence a missed approach. He did not make that decision probably because he was operating under a level of stress, where anxiety was interfering with his cognitive functioning" (5.3)). The psychologist's review suggested that the captain was under evaluative stress due to the check flight, which could have affected his performance ("The psychologist's opinion was that from this captain's perspective, the check flight changed the normal dynamics on the flight deck" (4.2.20)).

Crew Resource Management Training
Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training is a safety theme that involves training flight crews to use all available resources, including each other, to ensure safe flight operations. The presence of the check captain on the flight deck and its effect on crew dynamics and communications had not been thoroughly discussed during the pre-flight briefing, which could have blurred the boundaries of individual involvement in the flight deck operations ("The presence of the check captain on the flight deck and its effect on crew dynamics and communications had not been thoroughly discussed during the pre-flight briefing" (5.5)). This lack of clarity may have contributed to the first officer's uncertainty about when to intervene and challenge the captain, highlighting the need for effective CRM training to manage such situations.

Monitoring and Intervention by Check Captains
Monitoring and Intervention by Check Captains is a safety theme that pertains to the role of check captains in observing and, if necessary, intervening in flight operations to ensure safety. In this incident, the check captain's role and the extent to which they would allow a situation to develop before intervening were not clearly defined, which may have contributed to the lack of timely intervention during the approach ("A common dilemma for check pilots is how far they let a situation develop to enable key lessons to be demonstrated before it becomes unsafe" (4.3.3)). The check captain's presence and the dynamics it introduced to the cockpit environment were factors in the incident, as they potentially influenced the first officer's actions and the captain's stress levels.
Themes for 2017_202: 
Inadequate Use of Navigation Systems
The theme of inadequate use of navigation systems is highly relevant to this accident as the primary electronic navigation system, the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), was not utilized to its full potential. The crew were not fully conversant with its safety features, which compromised the ship's ability to navigate safely. "The primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral, the ECDIS, was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features" (4.1.5). Furthermore, the ECDIS safety parameters were not set appropriately for the confined channel navigation, reducing its effectiveness as a monitoring system "Not changing safety parameters to match the mode of navigation degraded the usefulness of the ECDIS as a system for monitoring the progress of the ship in a confined channel" (4.2.25).

Poor Bridge Resource Management
Poor bridge resource management is a significant safety theme in this accident. The standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral during the Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice. The bridge team failed to effectively challenge and respond to the pilot's actions, which led to the vessel deviating from the planned track without intervention. "The standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral during the Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice" (4.1.5). Additionally, there was a reluctance among the bridge team to question the person in command, which is a fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management "At the time of this and a previous accident, the reluctance of the bridge team to question the person in command or control of the ship was preventing effective challenge and response, a fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management" (5.8).

Reliance on Faulty Equipment
The reliance on faulty equipment is another safety theme that contributed to the accident. The rate-of-turn indicator, which was crucial for the pilotage, was known to be functioning erratically and had been a long-standing issue. The bridge team's decision to use a rate-of-turn method for conducting the pilotage despite the faulty indicator likely contributed to the accident. "The remote rate-of-turn indicator at the centre-front of the bridge was behaving erratically, deviating several degrees either side of the true value" (4.2.5). This equipment unreliability led to challenges in monitoring the ship's turn rate effectively "The unreliability of the rate-of-turn equipment questions the efficacy of conducting the pilotage based on the rate of turn, instead of issuing helm orders to maintain the desired track" (4.2.7).

Inadequate Pilotage Planning and Execution
Inadequate pilotage planning and execution is a central safety theme in this incident. The pilot initiated the turn earlier than planned without challenge from the crew, and there was no prior agreement on how far from the planned track the ship would be allowed to deviate. "The pilot later explained that he preferred to start his turns slowly and gradually increase the rate of turn. This was a departure from the agreed passage plan" (4.2.9). The lack of a clear understanding and adherence to the pilotage plan contributed to the loss of situational awareness and the subsequent grounding "The chain of events that led to the L'Austral grounding began when the pilot initiated the turn earlier than expected" (4.2.16).

Insufficient Risk Assessment for Blind Pilotage
Insufficient risk assessment for blind pilotage by the regional authority, Environment Southland, is a safety theme that has broader implications for maritime operations in the area. The absence of visual navigation aids and the reliance on electronic navigation systems during blind pilotage in confined waters were risks that had not been fully considered. "conducting blind pilotage with large ships in confined waters represented risks that had not been fully considered by environment southland" (4.1.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The recommendation for Environment Southland to review its risk assessment for the area underscores the importance of this safety theme "The Commission recommends that Environment Southland review its current risk assessment for the area and consider what measures could be introduced to improve navigational safety within the Fiordland region" (4.3.11).

Ineffective Communication and Monitoring
Ineffective communication and monitoring among the bridge team is a safety theme that played a critical role in the accident. The alarms from the radar and ECDIS indicating deviation from the planned track were not acted upon, and the bridge team did not voice their concerns or effectively monitor the ship's progress against the agreed plan. "None of these alarms caused any of the bridge team to voice their concern over the progress of the ship in the turn" (4.2.12). The lack of effective communication and monitoring is further highlighted by the master's failure to verbally intervene when noticing the deviation "The master said that he noticed the ship deviating significantly from the planned track, and that instead of voicing his concern as he was standing next to the pilot he made a hand gesture in the dark for him to turn further to port" (4.2.13).
Themes for 2013_007: 
Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Management
Foreign Object Debris (FOD) management is a critical safety theme that involves the prevention, detection, and removal of foreign objects that can cause damage to aircraft and compromise safety. In this accident, a rag was left inside the aircraft, which became trapped under a control cable on the forward cable drum of the stabiliser trim system, compromising the manual control integrity ("The integrity of the aeroplane's stabiliser trim system manual control was compromised by a rag that became trapped under a control cable" (5.1)). This incident underscores the importance of stringent FOD management practices to ensure that such objects do not pose a threat to aircraft operation ("foreign objects left inside an aircraft...are a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft" (4.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
Maintenance procedures and compliance are essential to ensure that aircraft are serviced correctly and safely. The relevance of this theme to the accident is evident in the fact that the rag likely entered the electronics and equipment compartment during cleaning, inspection, or maintenance at the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility ("It was highly likely that the rag ended up in the aeroplane's electronics and equipment compartment following cleaning, inspection, or maintenance conducted at the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility" (5.2)). The incident highlights the need for thorough adherence to maintenance procedures to prevent foreign objects from being left behind after maintenance ("Procedures developed to prevent foreign objects being left behind after maintenance must be adhered to in order to avoid similar incidents occurring in the future" (4.14)).

Quality Control and Inspection
Quality control and inspection are vital safety themes that involve the verification of aircraft components and systems to ensure they meet safety standards. The accident demonstrates the importance of this theme as the Boeing manufacturing process includes numerous inspections and quality-control processes that would normally prevent the delivery of an airplane with a rag left in a compartment where safety-critical systems are located ("The Boeing manufacturing process involves numerous inspections and quality-control processes that would normally prevent the aeroplane being delivered with a rag left in a compartment where safety-critical systems were located" (4.4)). Despite these measures, the rag was left in the aircraft, indicating a lapse in the quality control and inspection processes.

Housekeeping During Maintenance Operations
Housekeeping during maintenance operations is a safety theme that focuses on the organization and cleanliness of the work environment to prevent safety hazards. This theme is relevant to the accident as it was possible for an engineer to carry a rag while working near the trim cables, which could have been left behind or dropped, leading to the incident ("It is possible that an engineer carried a rag on them while working near the trim cables, which was either left behind or dropped and later became drawn onto the forward cable drum and under the cable windings" (4.10)). Good housekeeping practices are crucial to prevent such occurrences ("this incident...highlight the importance of good housekeeping during maintenance operations" (4.12 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Training and Awareness of Maintenance Personnel
Training and awareness of maintenance personnel are crucial to ensure that they are knowledgeable about the risks associated with their work and the importance of following procedures. The accident suggests a need for improved training and awareness as the rag was likely introduced into the aircraft during maintenance activities at the Sydney facility, and despite existing measures, rags were left in the aircraft ("It was highly likely that the rag ended up in the aeroplane's electronics and equipment compartment following cleaning, inspection, or maintenance conducted at the Qantas Sydney maintenance facility" (5.2), "Despite these measures being in place at the maintenance facilities, rags were left in the aircraft" (4.13)). This indicates that personnel may not have been fully aware of the consequences of leaving foreign objects in critical areas or the importance of thorough inspections.

Documentation and Record Keeping
Documentation and record keeping are important for tracking maintenance activities and ensuring accountability. This safety theme is relevant as the use of rags was not required to be controlled or recorded, making it impossible to determine when the rag may have been introduced into the flight deck or the electronics and equipment compartment ("It was not possible to determine when a rag may have been introduced into either the flight deck or the electronics and equipment compartment, because the use of rags was not required to be controlled or recorded" (4.9)). Proper documentation and record keeping would facilitate the identification of potential lapses in procedure and help prevent similar incidents.
Themes for 2019_103: 
Track Condition and Maintenance
The track condition and its maintenance were significant factors in the derailment. The report identified that there was no procedure for identifying, evaluating, and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature, which can promote unintended oscillation of wagons and potentially result in derailment. "Currently there is no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature that promote the unintended oscillation of wagons, potentially resulting in a derailment" (3.12). Additionally, the post-derailment manual track measurements showed a series of twists before and after the point of derailment (POD), which were within the allowed tolerances individually but not considered for their combined effect (3.10, 3.19).

Train Speed Compliance
Adherence to authorized line speeds is crucial for safe train operations, especially through points. In this accident, the train was traveling at nearly 36% above the authorized line speed, which was close to its critical rocking speed, contributing to the derailment. "The train was travelling at 9 km/h or 36% above the maximum authorised line speed when it derailed" (3.17). The train's speed in combination with the track condition likely accentuated harmonic oscillations, pushing the wagon's stability to the boundary of instability (3.19).

Wagon Design and Maintenance
The design and maintenance of the wagon, particularly its suspension system, were contributing factors to the derailment. The report found that the leading bogie of the derailed wagon had ineffective damping due to broken springs and out-of-code float readings. "A combination of three broken springs and out-of-code float readings resulted in wagon UKN143 having ineffective damping on its leading bogie" (4.4). Moreover, the last full overhaul of the wagon occurred over 12 years prior to the accident, indicating potential shortcomings in the maintenance regime (4.5).

Load Distribution and Center of Gravity
The center of gravity of the loaded wagon affects its stability, especially when traversing curves. The relatively high center of gravity of the loaded log wagon, while within allowable limits, was likely to have had a destabilizing effect, contributing to the wagon's ability to climb the rail and pass over the railhead. "While within the allowable limits, the relatively high centre of gravity of wagon UKN143 was about as likely as not to have had a destabilising effect" (3.34). This theme is relevant as it directly impacts the dynamic behavior of the wagon during operation.

Driver Training and Performance
The performance of the train driver and their adherence to operational protocols are critical for safety. In this case, the driver did not ensure that the rear of the train was clear of station limits before exceeding the authorized speed, and the train was traveling above the maximum authorized line speed at the time of derailment. "The driver had not ensured that the rear of the train was clear of station limits before the train speed could exceed 25 km/h" (3.17). Although fatigue was considered, the Commission was unable to determine if it contributed to the driver's actions (3.41).

Safety Management and Oversight
Effective safety management and oversight are essential to identify and mitigate risks. The lack of procedures for dealing with cyclic track twists and the absence of a recent full overhaul for the derailed wagon's bogies suggest gaps in safety management practices. "Currently there is no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature" (3.12) and "More than 12 years had passed since a full overhaul check had taken place on wagon UKN143" (4.5). These gaps could allow for the accumulation of conditions that increase the risk of accidents.
Themes for 2015_101: 
Pedestrian Awareness
Pedestrian awareness is a critical safety theme that involves the attentiveness and situational awareness of individuals in the vicinity of moving vehicles or trains. In the context of this accident, the pedestrian's awareness was compromised as he "was seen to be using his mobile phone while he walked down the platform ramp and he had bud-style earphones inserted in his ears" (3.1.8). The use of a mobile phone and earphones likely distracted the pedestrian from the auditory and visual cues that could have alerted him to the approaching train, contributing to the accident.

Auditory Warning Signals
Auditory warning signals are meant to alert pedestrians and motorists of an approaching train. This safety theme is relevant to the accident as the data recorders confirmed that "the flashing lights, audible bells and physical barriers at the Morningside Drive road level crossing were operating correctly and continuously for both trains" (3.1.9). Despite the correct operation of these warning systems, the pedestrian was wearing earphones connected to his mobile phone, which may have prevented him from hearing the train's whistle that was "used appropriately to warn pedestrians that the train was approaching" (3.1.9 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).

Visual Warning Systems
Visual warning systems, such as flashing lights and physical barriers, are designed to provide visual cues to indicate the presence of an oncoming train. This theme is pertinent as the accident report indicates that the "flashing lights, audible bells and physical barriers at the Morningside Drive road level crossing were operating correctly" (3.1.9). However, the pedestrian's focus on his mobile phone could have detracted from his ability to notice these visual warnings, leading to the fatal incident.

Train Operation and Speed
The operation and speed of the train in relation to the surrounding environment and safety measures is a significant safety theme. In this case, the "Waitākere-bound train was being driven at below the maximum line speed" (3.1.9), which suggests that the train was operating within the prescribed speed limits and the driver was adhering to safety protocols. This indicates that the train's operation was not a contributing factor to the accident, highlighting the importance of other safety themes such as pedestrian awareness and the effectiveness of warning signals.

Pedestrian Access Points
The design and location of pedestrian access points at train stations and crossings are crucial for ensuring safe passage. The accident occurred when the pedestrian "turned right through an opening and stepped out in front of the train" (3.1.7). This suggests that the access points and their design may need to be reviewed to ensure they provide clear visibility and do not inadvertently lead pedestrians into the path of oncoming trains.

Distraction by Personal Electronic Devices
The use of personal electronic devices, such as mobile phones and earphones, is a modern safety theme that has become increasingly relevant. In this incident, the pedestrian's use of these devices likely contributed to his lack of awareness. He "was seen to be using his mobile phone while he walked down the platform ramp and he had bud-style earphones inserted in his ears" (3.1.8), which could have distracted him from the operational warning signals and the approaching train, ultimately leading to the tragic outcome.
Themes for 2010_001: 
Weather Information Dissemination
The dissemination of weather information, particularly SIGMETs, is a critical safety theme in this accident. The crews of both flights may not have been aware of SIGMETs 28 and 31, which directly affected their planned routes and levels, due to limitations in the operator's dispatch system for updating flight information ("which weather briefings were used could not be confirmed, and it was possible that neither crew was aware of SIGMETs 28 and 31" (3.2)). Furthermore, the responsibility for ensuring that crews had the latest weather information was shared by the operator, the pilot-in-command, and ATC, indicating a systemic issue in the communication and updating of severe weather information that could affect aircraft operations ("The Rules indicated that the responsibility for ensuring that crews had the latest weather information was shared by the operator and the pilot-in-command, and ATC where an ATC service was provided" (3.5)).

Flight Crew Preparedness and Training
Flight crew preparedness and training is another safety theme highlighted by the accident. The pilots' prior experience and training were crucial in recognizing and recovering from the turbulence-induced upsets without incurring injury or damage ("The suggestions by some of the pilots that the aeroplanes' behaviour during the turbulence was very similar to that experienced in earlier simulator training proved the value of such training" (3.12)). This theme underscores the importance of realistic simulator training for handling severe weather conditions and unusual attitudes.

Air Traffic Control (ATC) Procedures and Communication
ATC procedures and communication with flight crews during emergencies is a significant safety theme. The first controller's passive response to the PAN call from NZ5046 and the lack of immediate clearance to deviate from altitude when the crew reported difficulty maintaining altitude indicate a need for improvement in ATC's handling of urgent situations ("the first controller did not hear the pan call from nz5046... the controller did not clear the flight to deviate from altitude as required" (3.13 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). In contrast, the replacement controller's proactive approach to managing NZ5034's flight by offering flexibility and increasing minimum vertical separation demonstrates the effectiveness of assertive ATC support during adverse conditions (3.14).

Pilot Reporting and Use of PIREPs
The use and dissemination of pilot reports (PIREPs) is a safety theme that emerged from the incident. PIREPs are essential for updating weather forecasts and informing other pilots of real-time conditions. The failure of the first controller to pass on the PIREP from NZ5046 suggests a procedural gap within ATC ("the first controller said he decided not to pass on the pirep from NZ5046" (3.15)). Additionally, the suggestion to include PIREPs in the AIP list of information that ATC would pass to aircraft indicates the need for better integration of PIREPs into in-flight services for the mutual benefit of all pilots (3.16).

SIGMET Interpretation and Clarity
The interpretation and clarity of SIGMETs are crucial for flight safety, as evidenced by this accident. The report highlights the importance of pilots and flight dispatchers interpreting SIGMETs correctly, as the abbreviated text can be misleading ("It was important that pilots and flight dispatchers interpreted SIGMETs correctly, because the abbreviated text, although standardised, could be misleading" (3.19)). The recommendation for greater use of plain language within SIGMETs and clearer reference to recognizable geographic regions addresses the safety issue of potential misinterpretation due to lack of clarity (3.20).

Flight Deck Preparedness for Turbulence
Ensuring the flight deck is prepared for turbulence is a safety theme that arose from the dislodging of items during the turbulence encounter. The report suggests that pilots should take more care to secure items under their control, just as they expect the cabin and its occupants to be secured ("The report of loose objects on one flight deck suggested pilots should take more care to secure items under their control" (3.10)). This theme emphasizes the importance of pre-flight preparation and securing all items to prevent potential hazards during unexpected severe turbulence.
Themes for 2013_103: 
Low Rail Adhesion Conditions
Low rail adhesion conditions are a significant safety theme as they directly impact the braking performance of trains, increasing the distance required to stop. This theme is relevant to the accident because "low rail-adhesion conditions existed in both of the Melling accidents" (4.1.2), and the wheel-slide protection activities recorded by the train data loggers confirm this condition (4.1.2). The analysis also indicates that "low adhesion was a common factor" in both accidents (4.2.11), and the weather conditions preceding the accidents were conducive to creating a low-adhesion layer between the rail and the train wheels (4.2.14, 4.2.15).

Train Braking System Performance
The performance of the train braking system, particularly in low-adhesion conditions, is a critical safety theme. In the Melling accidents, a contributing factor was that "the train braking system did not perform as well as it could have in the low-adhesion conditions" (4.1.5). The National Rail System Standards did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard, leading to the system not being optimized for low-adhesion conditions (4.1.6). The subsequent tests showed that the train brakes were not performing to their optimum in low-adhesion conditions (4.5.5), highlighting the importance of this safety theme.

Substance Impairment of Train Drivers
Substance impairment of train drivers is a significant safety theme as it can affect the cognitive functions necessary for safe train operation. The driver of the Melling 2 train tested positive for cannabis metabolites, and while it was not established whether his performance was impaired, "the use of performance-impairing substances by train drivers is a significant safety issue" (4.1.4). Cannabis is known to impair executive cognitive functions crucial for a train driver to operate safely (4.2.8), making this theme highly relevant to the accident.

Adequacy of Safety Standards
The adequacy of safety standards, particularly concerning braking performance in low-adhesion conditions, is a safety theme that emerged from the accidents. The National Rail System Standards (NRSS) did not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions for modern metropolitan passenger trains (5.7). The NRSS was silent on several critical aspects, including low-adhesion brake performance and wheel-slide prevention systems (4.4.11), which is a safety issue that needs to be addressed to prevent future occurrences.

Driver Training and Knowledge
Driver training and knowledge regarding the operation of train brake and wheel-slide protection systems is a safety theme that has implications for accident prevention. The training for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type did not provide drivers with sufficient information about the design and correct operation of these systems, especially in low-adhesion conditions (5.8). The lack of understanding of the differences between the two braking systems and the preference for using dynamic brakes in the Matangi trains contributed to the accidents (4.5.2, 4.5.3).

Infrastructure Risk Management at Terminating Stations
Infrastructure risk management at terminating stations, such as the design of stop blocks and the placement of overhead power lines, is a safety theme that affects the severity of accidents. In the Melling accidents, the operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform and colliding with the stop block had not been adequately considered (5.4). The concrete stop block installed in 1954 lacked impact-absorbing qualities, and the terminal pole for the overhead power was directly in the path of an overrun, exacerbating the consequences of the collisions (4.3.3, 4.3.4).
Themes for 2013_008: 
Cabin Pressurization System Reliability
The reliability of the cabin pressurization system is a critical safety theme in this accident because the incident involved an unexplained loss of cabin pressure. The analysis revealed that "no definite cause was found for the loss of cabin pressure" (4.1.2), and "an intermittent defect within the air-conditioning and pressurisation system could not be excluded as the cause of the loss of cabin pressure" (5.2). This indicates that the reliability of the system is in question, and any potential defects or intermittent issues within the system pose a significant safety risk.

Adherence to Emergency Procedures
Adherence to emergency procedures is a key safety theme because the pilots did not follow the emergency checklist actions exactly as prescribed, which "increased the risk of an action being omitted or a required sequence of actions being altered" (5.3). Specific deviations included not making a cabin announcement to warn the cabin crew of the emergency descent, not selecting the flight deck 'passenger oxygen' switch on, and not conducting checklist reviews out loud (4.5.4-4.5.7). These deviations from established procedures could have had serious consequences in a different situation.

Crew Training and Familiarity with Equipment
Crew training and familiarity with emergency equipment is a significant safety theme because the actions of some cabin crew members during the incident indicated a lack of familiarity with the oxygen equipment and the importance of fitting a mask without delay (5.4). The senior flight attendant did not activate the oxygen generator and had an incorrect interpretation of the oxygen mask flow indicator (4.5.16), and another flight attendant delayed fitting a mask (4.5.18). This suggests that the training did not adequately prepare the crew for a range of scenarios or familiarize them sufficiently with the equipment.

Communication During Emergencies
Effective communication during emergencies is a crucial safety theme, as evidenced by the pilot's omission of the internationally recognized urgency signal "PAN, PAN, PAN" during the radio call to air traffic control (4.5.10). This could have led to misunderstandings about the severity of the situation. Additionally, the lack of a cabin announcement by the pilot flying could have left the cabin crew uncertain about the nature of the emergency (4.5.5).

Maintenance and Inspection of Safety Equipment
The maintenance and inspection of safety equipment is a relevant safety theme because the incident revealed potential issues with the packing and maintenance of oxygen masks. Improper packing of the oxygen mask was identified as the likely reason for the failure of an oxygen generator to activate (4.5.17). This highlights the importance of proper maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the functionality of critical safety equipment.

Manual Mode Procedures After Emergency Checklists
Procedures for manual mode operation of the pressurization system after emergency checklists are a pertinent safety theme. The incident brought to light that the Cabin Altitude Warning checklist did not require pilots to ensure that the airplane was depressurized before landing, which could lead to difficulties in opening cabin doors on the ground (4.6.1-4.6.2). This oversight in the checklist could have serious implications for passenger evacuation in an emergency.
Themes for 2018_101: 
Rail Manufacturing and Quality Control
Rail manufacturing and quality control is a critical safety theme as it directly impacts the integrity of the rail infrastructure. In this accident, the fracture of the switch rail was initiated at a "manufacturing defect where a chamfer had been machined on the foot of a switch rail" (5.3). This defect "likely resulted in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture resistance of the rail" (4.3.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), which was located at a point of maximum in-service rail loading (5.4). The presence of chatter marks, a machining defect, at the fracture initiation point underscores the importance of stringent quality control during the manufacturing process to prevent such defects that can lead to critical failures (4.3.7).

Inspection and Detection Methods
Inspection and detection methods are vital for identifying potential rail defects before they result in incidents. In this case, the chatter marks on the outer foot of the rail, which led to the fracture, "could no longer be observed by current inspection procedures" once the switch rail had been installed (4.5.1). Additionally, ultrasonic testing, which is part of the regular inspection regime, has limitations and is "unable to detect a defect from the foot of the rail unless such a defect propagated into the web" (4.5.6). The derailment occurred despite regular visual and ultrasonic inspections that did not detect the defect (4.5.3, 4.5.7), highlighting the need for improved inspection methods capable of identifying such critical defects.

Signalling and Train Control Systems
Signalling and train control systems are designed to maintain safe train operations and prevent collisions. However, they may not always detect track defects such as broken rails. In this incident, the signalling system provided a proceed signal into the damaged section because "the electrical circuit was complete" despite the broken switch rail (4.2.4). The axle-counter system used in Auckland, which does not rely on track circuitry, "is not an entirely reliable method of detecting broken rails" and is estimated to indicate an occupied track in no more than 60% of cases involving a broken rail (4.6.3). This accident demonstrates the limitations of current signalling systems in detecting certain types of track failures and the need for additional safety measures.

Supplier Quality Assurance and Compliance
Supplier quality assurance and compliance are essential to ensure that rail components meet the necessary standards and specifications. In this accident, KiwiRail was "unable to provide the Commission with the certificate of compliance" for the switch rail that fractured (4.4.5). The lack of a certificate of compliance raises concerns about the supplier's adherence to quality standards and KiwiRail's recordkeeping practices. Furthermore, the supply agreement did not specify a surface roughness standard for machined components, which could have prevented the chatter marks that led to the rail fracture (4.4.4). Ensuring suppliers meet quality standards and maintaining proper documentation are crucial for rail safety.

Rail Infrastructure Design and Maintenance
Rail infrastructure design and maintenance are key factors in preventing accidents. The design of the switching equipment allowed for a proceed signal to be given even when the switch rail was fractured (4.2.4). Additionally, the rail fracture occurred at a location of maximum in-service loading, which suggests that the design may not have adequately accounted for the stresses experienced by the rail in operation (5.4). Regular maintenance and design reviews are necessary to identify and mitigate potential weaknesses in rail infrastructure.

Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures
Emergency response and evacuation procedures are critical for ensuring the safety of passengers and crew in the event of an accident. In this incident, the driver's immediate activation of the train's emergency brake and the subsequent evacuation were conducted "appropriately and in accordance with the operator's procedures" (5.6). The Commission found no safety issues with the first response to the accident (5.6), indicating that effective emergency response and evacuation procedures were in place and followed correctly, which is essential for minimizing the consequences of such incidents.
Themes for 2018_205: 
Lack of Specific Risk Assessments and Safe Operating Procedures
The absence of a specific risk assessment and safe operating procedure for the accumulator is a significant safety theme in this accident. The report states that "the accumulator did not have its own risk assessment or safe operating procedure, and therefore the risk of an operator becoming trapped in the framework while it was operational had not been identified" (4.3). This lack of specific safety measures meant that the risks associated with the accumulator were not fully understood, and the safety controls relied heavily on the machine operator following generic instructions and procedures (3.3). The failure to identify and assess the hazards posed by the vertical movement of the accumulator floor and associated framework contributed to the accident (3.14).

Inadequate Guarding and Interlock Systems
Inadequate guarding and interlock systems are another safety theme related to this accident. The report indicates that the gate between the weighing and packing station and the back of the accumulator was not fitted with an interlock, allowing the freezerman to enter the ring-fenced area without the machinery shutting down automatically (3.13). Furthermore, the report suggests that "had the advice from the earlier safety assessments been heeded and interlocks fitted at access points to the guarded area, the risk could have been minimised and not been reliant on administrative controls alone" (3.20). This highlights the importance of physical safety barriers and automated systems to prevent access to hazardous areas.

Reliance on Administrative Controls Over Engineering Controls
The reliance on administrative controls over engineering controls is a critical safety theme in this accident. The report discusses that due to operational issues, fitting interlocks was impractical, leading to a focus on administrative controls such as procedures and instructions (3.10, 3.11). However, these controls depend on operators following procedures, which can be less reliable than engineering controls like physical guards or interlocks (3.1). The report emphasizes that "once inside the guarded area, the only safety controls available to the operator of the accumulator were basic training in machine safety and an area-specific safe operating procedure" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), underscoring the vulnerability of relying on administrative controls.

Training and Confusion Around Emergency Stops
Training and confusion around emergency stops are directly related to the safety of the operation and are a theme in this accident. The report notes that there was confusion among the crew regarding which emergency stops serviced which system, and this confusion was likely the result of poor awareness passed on through training (3.15, 3.16). Although it was unlikely that this issue contributed directly to the accident, it indicates a potential risk where crew could access running machinery after pressing an incorrect emergency stop (3.16).

Impairment and Fitness for Duty
Impairment and fitness for duty are significant safety themes in this accident. The freezerman's decision-making abilities were likely adversely affected by some form of impairment, which could have been due to the presence of methamphetamine in their system (3.8, 3.24). The report states that "the combined effects of drug use, shift work and possible fatigue on an essentially unsupervised factory operator very likely increased the risk of an accident occurring" (3.27). This theme highlights the importance of ensuring that all personnel are fit for duty, especially when operating complex machinery.

Fatigue and Shift Work
Fatigue and shift work are recognized as factors that can compromise safety and are relevant to this accident. The operator acknowledged that shift work contributes to fatigue, which in turn is a risk to health and safety (3.32). The report also mentions that the freezerman was working alone in the early hours of the morning, a time when human performance can be adversely affected (3.2, 3.34). The consumption of stimulant drugs in a shift work environment could temporarily mask tiredness but ultimately exacerbate fatigue, increasing the risk of an accident (3.34).
Themes for 2017_106: 
Adherence to Safety Procedures
Adherence to safety procedures is a critical theme in this accident, as there was "poor adherence to existing safety procedures" (4.1.2). The pilot did not fully check the setting of the points to the maintenance depot, which led to the incorrect routing of the locomotives (4.3.8). This lack of adherence to procedures contributed to the accident, highlighting the importance of following established safety protocols.

Audit and Compliance Testing
The level of audit and compliance testing is another significant safety theme, as the report indicates that the "level of audit and compliance testing of the invercargill joint operating plan were not robust in detecting and addressing compliance issues in the invercargill yard" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of effective auditing allowed non-conformities and non-compliance to go unchecked, which directly contributed to the accident (4.3.12).

Clarity and Availability of Procedures
The clarity and availability of procedures are a safety theme because the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan did not have "procedures for the completion of safety-critical tasks" that were either adequate or existing (4.1.2). Additionally, the plan did not document a requirement for the derailer to be padlocked in place (4.2.5), which is a clear example of the lack of detailed procedures that could have prevented the accident.

Equipment Compatibility and Design
Equipment compatibility and design are relevant to this accident, as the derailer's design was not compatible with the cowcatcher on the lead locomotive, which resulted in the derailer being torn off before it could derail the locomotive (4.2.11). This incompatibility is a safety issue that should have been identified and addressed to ensure the derailer could perform its intended safety function.

Division of Responsibilities
The division of responsibilities between staff is a safety theme, as there was a split of responsibility that required operations staff to liaise with mechanical staff for removing maintenance depot protection (4.3.2). However, the practice of operational staff removing and reinstating depot protection was a violation of the Joint Operating Plan (4.3.4), indicating a breakdown in the understanding and execution of assigned responsibilities.

Situational Awareness of Pilots
Situational awareness of pilots is a theme because the pilot assumed the points were set correctly without verifying them, due to the presence of the derailer and stop-disc (4.2.8). This assumption and the subsequent lack of visual confirmation of the locomotives' path (4.2.10) demonstrate a lapse in situational awareness that is critical for safe rail operations.
Themes for 2012_002: 
Engine Performance Monitoring
Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme as it involves the detection and management of potential engine issues before they result in an incident. In this accident, the engine failure was a direct result of damage from a bird strike that was not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control (MOC) due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system ("Indications that the right-hand engine was not performing well were not detected by the Maintenance Operation Control due to programming logic errors in the automated engine condition report system" (4.3.7)). The failure to detect the engine's deteriorating performance meant that the crew and MOC were not alerted to the potential problem, which could have allowed for earlier intervention and possibly prevented the engine compressor stall event on landing at Auckland.

Wildlife Hazard Management
Wildlife hazard management is a safety theme that addresses the risk of wildlife, such as birds, interacting with aircraft, which can lead to dangerous situations like bird strikes. This accident was initiated by a bird strike event when a black-backed gull was ingested into the engine core ("It is highly likely that this contained engine failure was the result of a single bird strike event on the previous flight when the aeroplane was landing at Wellington Aerodrome" (5.1)). Although Wellington International Airport had an effective bird management program in place ("Wellington International Airport is providing an effective bird management programme that is keeping the risk of bird strikes as low as reasonably practicable" (5.5)), the incident underscores the importance of continuous improvement and vigilance in wildlife hazard management programs.

Maintenance Procedures and Inspections
Maintenance procedures and inspections are a safety theme that involves the processes and checks carried out to ensure aircraft are fit for flight. In this case, the engineer who inspected the aircraft at Wellington followed the prescribed procedure for a bird strike and performed additional actions to identify any damage. Despite these efforts, no damage was found, and the aircraft was released back into service ("The engineer who carried out the inspection at Wellington followed the prescribed procedure for a bird strike" (4.1.2)). The subsequent engine failure early in the 10-hour allowance highlights the importance of effective maintenance procedures and the potential need for more stringent inspection protocols following incidents such as bird strikes.

Risk Management and Analysis
Risk management and analysis is a safety theme that involves assessing potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate risks. The engine manufacturer performed risk assessments and developed maintenance manual inspection schedules based on these assessments, including the fly-on allowance under which the engine in this incident was released ("The engine manufacturer performed mathematical risk assessments based on the regulator's requirements and developed the aircraft maintenance manual inspection schedules based on the mathematical results" (4.2.5)). However, the occurrence of the engine failure within the fly-on allowance period suggests that the risk analysis may need to be revisited to ensure it adequately accounts for the potential severity and likelihood of similar incidents.

Crew Response and Training
Crew response and training is a safety theme that focuses on the actions taken by flight and cabin crew during an emergency and their preparedness for such situations. In this incident, the crew's initial actions on becoming aware of the problem with the right engine on approach to Auckland were in accordance with the quick reference handbook checklist, and the captain made appropriate decisions under the circumstances ("The crew's initial actions on becoming aware of a problem with the right engine on approach to Auckland were in accordance with the quick reference handbook checklist" (4.5.2)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of crew training and the ability to respond effectively to in-flight emergencies.

Regulatory Oversight and Certification
Regulatory oversight and certification is a safety theme that involves the standards and approvals set by aviation authorities to ensure aircraft safety. The engine's design, which contained damage to inside the engine after the bird strike, is a required feature for which the engine is certified ("The containment of damage to inside the engine is a required design feature for which the engine is certified" (4.2.3)). This theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the role of regulatory bodies in certifying aircraft components and the need for continuous evaluation of certification standards in light of new data and incidents.
Themes for 2017_204: 
Mooring Equipment Integrity
The integrity of mooring equipment, specifically the bollards, was a critical factor in the Seabourn Encore accident. The bollards failed to withstand the forces imparted on them by the ship's mooring lines during the weather event, leading to the vessel breaking away from its berth. The report states that "the mooring bollards failed because the unique method with which each had been fastened to the wharf and/or the strength of the underlying wharf structure meant they were unable to withstand the forces" (5.3). Additionally, the bollards were not secured in a way consistent to achieve their designed safe working load, making it virtually impossible to establish a known safe working load for each (4.3.16).

Mooring Procedures Adherence
The adherence to mooring procedures is another safety theme highlighted by the accident. The port's mooring procedures were not strictly followed, which increased the vulnerability of the mooring arrangement. For instance, "one stern line had been placed over a timber bollard, and two stern lines had been placed over steel bollard 26, a refurbished bollard used for servicing cruise vessels" without approval from the duty pilot, which was a departure from the procedure (4.5.9). This non-adherence to procedures contributed to the failure of the mooring bollards.

Weather Preparedness and Response
Weather preparedness and response is a significant safety theme in this accident. The port company's documented response to a predicted weather event was not strictly followed, resulting in neither the ship's crew nor the port company resources being fully prepared to respond in a timely manner (5.7). The report also notes that the duty pilot attempted to alert the master with advance warning of the predicted increase in wind strength, but the ship's staff did not act on the information (4.5.4). This lack of effective response to weather warnings increased the risk of the accident.

Knowledge of Safe Working Loads
Knowing the safe working loads of mooring bollards is crucial for safe ship operations, and the lack of this knowledge is a safety theme related to the accident. The port company had virtually no knowledge of the actual safe working loads of the various mooring bollards on the wharf (5.6). The report emphasizes that "the safe working loads of the bollards on Number One Wharf were unknown and therefore it was not possible to determine whether the mooring plan for any ship was safe" (4.4).

Structural Condition of the Wharf
The structural condition of the wharf is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The engineering assessment of Number One Wharf identified deficiencies in the condition of the supporting timber structure, which led to a program of replacing decaying timber (4.4.1). However, the assessment did not examine bollards or the outer edge of the wharf (4.4.2). The failure of the bollards due to the underlying structure's inability to withstand the loads highlights the importance of the wharf's structural integrity.

Effective Communication of Weather Information
Effective communication of weather information is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The report indicates that the duty pilot passed on a message advising the vessel of the approaching southerly wind, but the warning failed to trigger any direct response from the port and effectively left the ship to its own devices (4.2.13). The lack of effective communication and response to the high wind warning contributed to the ship not being adequately prepared for the weather event.
Themes for 2011_102: 
Risk Management Approach to Assessing and Managing a Safety-Critical Function
The theme of risk management approach to assessing and managing a safety-critical function is highly relevant to this accident as it highlights the failure to properly assess and manage the increased risks associated with merging the Otira/Rolleston section and the West Coast area during the daytime. The Commission found that "KiwiRail did not properly assess the implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section and the West Coast area during the daytime" (5.3). This resulted in a higher-than-usual level of risk for train control because it required one train controller to manage two normally busy lines (5.2). The lack of a proper risk assessment and management strategy for this change in the normal roster was a significant oversight that contributed to the accident (5.4).

Stress and Mental Fatigue
Stress and mental fatigue is a critical safety theme in this accident as it directly impacted the train controller's performance. The train controller was found to be "stressed, mentally fatigued and operating well below an optimal level when she made her error" (5.6). The Commission noted that during the train controller's last hour of her shift, she dealt with a greater number of calls than usual, which contributed to her stress and fatigue (5.5). Furthermore, there was a lack of awareness within train control of the train controller's growing stress and mental fatigue, even though she was performing a safety-critical function with a higher-than-usual level of risk (5.7). This lack of awareness and support for managing stress and fatigue was a significant factor in the accident.

Supervision and Support
Supervision and support, or the lack thereof, is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The train controller "received no support and minimal supervision during her 5-hour shift" despite the high demands of working a merged desk and the higher-than-usual level of risk associated with this arrangement (5.11). The absence of proper supervision meant that no one within train control was aware of the train controller's workload and her increasingly stressed state in the last hour of her shift (5.12). This lack of supervision and support contributed to the environment in which the train controller made the critical error.

Rest Breaks and Workload Management
The theme of rest breaks and workload management is relevant to this accident as the train controller was unable to take breaks during her shift due to her high workload. The Commission found that "train control protocols required train controllers to work their shifts without scheduled breaks" and that the train controller believed she could not leave her room during her 5-hour shift because of her high workload (4.6.1, 4.6.2). This resulted in her not having a rest, getting something to eat or drink, or going to the toilet during her shift, which was unsafe for her and those relying on her judgment (4.6.6, 4.6.7). The lack of scheduled breaks and the high workload without proper management of the risks associated with such an approach were significant safety issues.

Planning and Coordination of Track Infrastructure Activity
Poor planning and coordination of track infrastructure activities is a safety theme that exacerbated the complexity of the train controller's work on the day of the incident. The train controller had to deal with a high volume of routine and unplanned track infrastructure activities, which increased the complexity of her role and the likelihood of making mistakes (4.7.1, 4.7.2). The Commission noted that "the poor planning and co-ordination of these activities unnecessarily exacerbated the complexity of her work" (4.7.10 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The lack of proper processes to coordinate and manage track infrastructure activity was a contributing factor to the accident.

Visibility of Rail Vehicles on the Network
The visibility of rail vehicles on the network is a safety theme that relates to the train controller's ability to monitor train movements. The Commission pointed out that "a large number of rail movements and track activities are not electronically visible to train control at any given time" (4.7). The Midland Line, including the Otira/Rolleston section, operates with single-line automatic signalling, which relies heavily on train controllers' memories and situational awareness (4.8.2, 4.8.3). The lack of electronic visibility increased the complexity of the train controller's job and the potential for error. Since the incident, KiwiRail has introduced a system to improve the electronic visibility of trains, which would have aided the train controller in this case (4.8.4, 4.8.5).
Themes for 2019_003: 
Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)
Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) is a situation where an airworthy aircraft under the control of the pilot is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle. In this accident, the aircraft descended below the minimum safe altitude and struck the terrain in a straight and level attitude, which is characteristic of a CFIT accident. The pilots were likely unaware of the danger until it was too late, as evidenced by the fact that "the aeroplane struck the terrain at about 4,500 feet (1,371 m) in about a straight and level attitude" (3.1) and the nature of the accident has "the characteristics of a 'controlled flight into terrain' accident" (3.2).

Flight Authorization and Planning Procedures
The flight authorization and planning procedures are critical for ensuring that flights are conducted safely and in accordance with the operator's requirements. In this accident, the pilot self-authorized the flight as a 'refresher or rental' without following the operator's procedures that required authorization by a training management instructor. This lack of adherence to the authorization procedures is a significant safety issue because "the pilot did not follow the operator's authorisation procedures" (4.9) and "the operator's flight-authorisation procedures were not sufficiently robust to prevent students and qualified pilots conducting flights without the requisite authorisation from supervising instructors" (4.10).

Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) Adherence
Adherence to the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) is essential for preventing CFIT accidents. In this case, the aircraft descended below the MSA for the sector, which was a contributing factor to the accident. The pilots did not effectively validate the new route after deviating from the planned track, leading to a descent below the MSA, as indicated by "the aeroplane was descended below the specified minimum safe altitude for the area in which the aeroplane was being flown" (4.1) and "the aeroplane descending below 7,800 feet, the sector MSA, indicates that an effective validation of the new route was not performed by either pilot" (3.29).

Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS)
Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS) are designed to prevent CFIT by alerting pilots of potential terrain conflicts. In this accident, it is very likely that the aeroplane's terrain proximity awareness system was either excessively dimmed or not selected, so the terrain ahead was not displayed during the descent. This safety issue is highlighted by the finding that "it was very likely that the aeroplane's terrain proximity awareness system was either excessively dimmed or not selected" (4.5) and the fact that the aircraft was not equipped with an impending-terrain-collision warning (3.34).

Pilot Experience and Supervision
The experience of the pilot and the level of supervision provided are important factors in flight safety. In this accident, the pilot and safety pilot had little experience in night instrument-flight-rules navigation, and the pilot's experience and training status required appropriate supervision that should have been provided by the operator's flight-authorization procedures. The relevance of this theme is evident as "the pilot and safety pilot were appropriately licensed and qualified for the flight, but had little experience in night instrument-flight-rules navigation" (4.7) and "the pilot's experience and training status required appropriate supervision that should have been provided by the operator's flight-authorisation procedures" (4.8).

Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Functionality
The functionality of the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is crucial for the timely location of an aircraft following an accident. In this case, the ELT did not function as designed, which is a safety issue because it could affect the speed and effectiveness of search and rescue operations. This is highlighted by the finding that "the emergency locator transmitter did not function as designed" (4.12).
Themes for 2012_203: 
Fire Detection Systems
Fire detection systems are critical for early identification of a fire, allowing for prompt response and containment. In the case of the Amaltal Columbia, the absence of fire detectors within the fishmeal bagging room was a significant safety issue. The report states, "There was a fire detector located outside the compartment and another above the fish processing plant, but none had been fitted inside the bagging room" (4.4.1). This lack of internal fire detection delayed the crew's awareness of the fire, as "When the crew noticed smoke the fire had taken hold and spread quickly" (4.4.2). The installation of fire detectors in all critical areas, especially enclosed spaces, is essential to improve safety and reduce the risk of fire spreading undetected.

Flammability of Materials
The flammability of materials used in ship construction and operation can significantly influence the spread and intensity of a fire. In this incident, the flammability of polypropylene bags and the plastic lining used in the fish processing factory contributed to the fire's propagation. The report highlights that "Polypropylene is a highly flammable material" (4.2.8) and that "the plastic lining melted and appeared to have burnt during the fire" (4.6.2). These materials not only fueled the fire but also produced "thick, acrid smoke that hindered initial firefighting efforts" (4.6.2). Ensuring that materials used in ship construction and operation are fire-retardant or have low flammability is crucial for reducing the risk of fire spread and intensity.

Ventilation System Design
The design of ventilation systems can impact the ability to contain a fire by controlling the oxygen supply. The Amaltal Columbia's ventilation system had flaps that were not "quick, easy and intuitive to operate" (4.5.5), which complicated the crew's efforts to contain the fire by closing off the air supply. The report notes that "the crew found it difficult to close the flaps when unable to see the mechanism through the dense smoke" (4.5.4). The design of such critical systems should facilitate rapid and straightforward operation, especially during emergencies, to enhance fire containment and crew safety.

Electrical System Safety
The safety of a ship's electrical system is paramount in preventing fires. In this case, an electrical extension lead that did not comply with industry best practice was identified as a potential source of ignition. The report states that "the extension lead did not comply with industry best practice" and "was free to abrade against the bulkhead" (4.2.14), which could lead to "an earth-fault or short-circuiting and consequent arcing or a build-up of heat" (4.2.17). Ensuring that electrical systems are installed and maintained according to best practices is essential to minimize the risk of electrical fires.

Crew Training and Emergency Response
Effective crew training and emergency response are critical for dealing with fires on board ships. In this incident, the crew's response was well-conducted and followed standard procedures (4.1.2). The report states, "when they discovered the fire the crew responded quickly and their actions were in accordance with the instructions contained in the safe ship management manual" (4.3.1). This highlights the importance of regular drills and clear procedures to ensure that the crew is prepared to respond effectively to emergencies.

Risk-Based Approach to Safety
Adopting a risk-based approach to safety management allows for the identification and mitigation of potential hazards beyond the minimum compliance with maritime rules. The report emphasizes that "owners and operators should take a risk-based approach to their operations" (4.7.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) and that "several improvements could have been made that may have prevented or minimised the consequences of this fire" (4.7.4). This approach involves assessing potential risks and implementing measures to reduce them to as low as reasonably practicable, which is crucial for enhancing overall safety on board ships.
Themes for 2013_003: 
Mast Bump and Main Rotor Blade Contact
Mast bumping is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it was the direct cause of the in-flight break-up. The report states that "a mast bump had preceded the in-flight break-up" and that "severe in-flight mast bumping usually results in main rotor shaft separation and/or rotor blade contact with the fuselage" (4.1.2). The mast bump was likely triggered by moderate or greater turbulence, which resulted in a low-G condition, exacerbated by the helicopter's light weight and high airspeed (5.2). This theme is relevant because it identifies the mechanical failure that led to the accident and the conditions that precipitated it.

Turbulence and Low-G Conditions
Turbulence and low-G conditions are significant safety themes as they are environmental factors that contributed to the mast bump. The report indicates that the helicopter encountered "moderate or greater turbulence" which likely resulted in a low-G condition (5.2). The pilot's potential response to this turbulence with inappropriate control inputs could have caused the mast bump (4.2.12). This theme is relevant as it highlights the environmental and operational conditions that can rapidly lead to catastrophic events in helicopters with sensitive rotor systems.

Pilot Training and Handling Characteristics
Pilot training and understanding of the helicopter's handling characteristics are safety themes because the report suggests that the lack of special pilot training requirements for the R66 may have been a contributing factor. The R66 was certified without special training requirements or operating restrictions, unlike the smaller R22, which has the same main rotor design (4.3.1). The report also states that "the possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot contributed to the mast bump cannot be excluded" (5.3). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of adequate pilot training to safely operate helicopters, especially in challenging conditions.

Flight Manual Warnings and Guidance
The adequacy of flight manual warnings and guidance is a safety theme because the report found that "the Robinson helicopter flight manuals did not adequately warn pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump" (5.6). The report also notes that the safety notices were not part of the FAA-approved flight manual, and there was no reference to turbulence in any FAA-approved Robinson flight manual at the time of the accident (4.5.3). This theme is relevant as it addresses the need for clear and explicit guidance to pilots regarding the risks associated with their aircraft and operating environment.

Helicopter Design and Certification
Helicopter design and certification processes are safety themes because the report discusses the R66's certification process and the similarities in main rotor design with the R22 and R44, which have experienced similar types of accidents (4.4.13). The report also mentions that the R66 certification program did not require testing the helicopter's response to low G, despite this being a known risk for mast bump in the R22 and R44 (4.4.17). This theme is relevant as it highlights potential gaps in the certification process that may not fully account for the operational risks associated with certain helicopter designs.

Knowledge of Rotor System Dynamics
The industry's knowledge of the dynamic behavior of lightweight, teetering, underslung rotor systems is a safety theme because the report identifies a lack of understanding as to why Robinson helicopters are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events (5.7). The report suggests that further research into the dynamic behavior of such rotor systems could help eliminate mast bump accidents (4.6.10). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for advanced research to improve the safety of helicopters with this type of rotor system, which could lead to design improvements or operational guidelines to prevent similar accidents.

The bilge pumping system's lack of an automatic alert for abnormal water levels in the fish hold was a significant safety issue. The crew was not alerted when the water in the fish hold reached a critical level, which likely contributed to the sinking. "the bilge pumping system on the jubilee was not fitted with any means of automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level" (4.3.40). Additionally, the absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse to alert the crew when the bilge pump was running meant that the system was non-compliant with Maritime Rules, leaving the crew unaware of the accumulating water. "There was no other means fitted to the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew to excess water in the fish hold" (4.3.40).

Vessel Stability and Buoyancy
The vessel's stability and buoyancy were compromised due to water ingress, which is a fundamental aspect of maritime safety. The analysis showed that the fish hold only needed to be between 60% and 70% full before down-flooding occurred into other compartments, leading to the vessel sinking by the stern. "the calculations carried out by the naval architect showed that the fish hold only needed to be between 60% and 70% full before down-flooding occurred into other compartments" (4.3.24 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of watertight compartments and the critical nature of managing free surface effects on stability.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
The crew's inability to effectively respond to the emergency situation suggests a lack of preparedness. The crew tried to make a phone call and issued a distress call but were unable to escape the wheelhouse. "The skipper and crew of the Jubilee were aware that they were in trouble. They tried to telephone the Legacy but the call was not answered" (4.4.1). The fact that all three crew members were trapped inside the wheelhouse with the sliding door shut indicates that emergency response measures were insufficient. "Whatever happened occurred quickly, because all three crew members were trapped inside the wheelhouse with the sliding door leading onto the main deck shut" (4.4.6).

Means of Escape and Evacuation
The design of the vessel did not provide adequate means of escape in an emergency, which is a critical safety theme. The wheelhouse had limited escape options, and the secondary means of escape through the forecastle and chain locker did not lead directly to the open deck, potentially not meeting the intent of the Maritime Rules. "the means of escape from the jubilee's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency afforded the crew too few options for escaping in the event of capsize or sinking" (4.4.20 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of having multiple and accessible escape routes for crew safety during emergencies.

Watchkeeping and Crew Alertness
The designated watchkeeper's role is crucial for monitoring the vessel's condition and responding to alarms or unusual movements. In this case, the crew's alertness was compromised, possibly due to sleep or distraction. "Someone who was asleep or distracted by using a mobile phone would have been less likely to notice any unusual attitude or movement of the vessel as it was taking on water" (4.2.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of maintaining a proper lookout and the potential consequences of inattention or fatigue on crew performance and safety.

Compliance with Maritime Rules
Compliance with Maritime Rules is a fundamental safety theme, as these rules are designed to ensure the safety of maritime operations. In this incident, the vessel's bilge pumping system was found to be non-compliant with the rules, lacking a visual indicator to alert the crew when the bilge pump was running. "The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alerted the crew when the bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping system was non-compliant with Maritime Rules" (4.3.40). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the potential safety implications of non-compliance and the need for vessels to adhere to established safety standards.
Themes for 2010_102: 
Landslide Risk Management
Landslide risk management is a critical safety theme for rail operations in hilly terrains, as landslides pose a significant threat to the safety of trains. In the case of the Wellington metropolitan rail network, the topography is hilly, making landslides a natural and predictable event, especially during heavy rain which can trigger such occurrences. The report highlights that "The landslide was a predictable event because heavy rain could trigger landslides and they had occurred at that site before" (4.1.2). Furthermore, KiwiRail had a slope ranking system to evaluate landslide risks, but the report found that "KiwiRail had not conducted a complete risk assessment for each identified location to identify what action could be taken to reduce the risk in the meantime" (5.5). This indicates that while there was an awareness of the risk, the measures in place were not sufficient to prevent the accident, making landslide risk management a relevant safety theme.

Emergency Response Coordination
Emergency response coordination is a safety theme that involves the preparedness and effectiveness of responding to accidents. The report states that "the emergency response to the accident was effective and generally well-coordinated" (5.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), indicating that the response to this particular incident was handled well. However, it also notes that "Improvements were identified in the subsequent emergency response debrief for inclusion in the relevant emergency response plans" (4.1.5), suggesting that there is always room for improvement and learning from each incident to enhance future responses. This theme is relevant because the effectiveness of the emergency response can significantly affect the outcome of an accident, including the safety and well-being of passengers and crew.

Weather Monitoring and Response
Weather monitoring and response is a safety theme that deals with how railway operations are adjusted in response to severe weather conditions that could affect safety. In this accident, there was a failure to adequately respond to severe weather warnings, which contributed to the incident. The report notes that "the network control manager did not send any of the updates to the severe weather warning to the area manager as he should have done" (4.3.3) and that "a speed restriction had not been put in place for the area of the cutting" (4.3.11). This indicates that the existing weather monitoring and response systems were not effectively utilized to mitigate the risk of the landslide, making this a relevant safety theme for the accident.

Train Crashworthiness
Train crashworthiness refers to the ability of a train to protect its occupants in the event of a collision or derailment. The report discusses the crashworthiness of the Ganz trains involved in the accident, stating that "The driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during the collision sequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their driving positions before impact they would likely have been fatally injured" (5.8). It also mentions that the Ganz trains "did not perform as well as a modern train during a similar front-end collision" (5.9). This theme is relevant because the structural integrity and design of the trains directly impact the safety of the drivers and passengers during accidents.

Communication Systems
Communication systems are essential for ensuring safety in rail operations, particularly in the event of an emergency. The report identifies a significant issue with the communication systems on the Wellington commuter fleet, noting that "Most of the passenger trains in the Wellington commuter fleet are not equipped with selcall-capable radio equipment" (5.7). This lack of capability meant that "there could be a critical delay in train control being alerted in time to prevent the event escalating" (5.7). The absence of effective communication systems was a contributing factor to the severity of the accident, making this a pertinent safety theme.

Operational Practices and Speed Restrictions
Operational practices and the implementation of speed restrictions are safety themes that involve the procedures and decisions made by railway staff to ensure safe train operations. The report indicates that there were lapses in operational practices, such as the failure to conduct a special track inspection despite the severe weather warning and the location being prone to landslides (4.3.2). Additionally, the absence of a speed restriction at the time of the accident was highlighted as a factor that could have prevented or minimized the collision, as "A 25 km/h temporary train speed restriction would likely have prevented Train 6247 from colliding with the stationary derailed Train 6250" (5.2). This theme is relevant because proper operational practices and the timely implementation of speed restrictions are crucial for maintaining safety, especially during adverse weather conditions.
Themes for 2013_104: 
Maintenance Procedures and Documentation
The lack of documented task instructions for safety-critical tasks, such as those related to the maintenance of the Ganz Mavag fleet, is a significant safety theme. The Wellington metro maintenance depot had no means of recording progress against individual steps in a task, which contributed to the omission of fitting retaining split pins on the bolts securing the spring park brake assembly. This omission led to the brake assembly becoming disconnected and ultimately causing the derailment ("there were no documented task instructions setting out how safety-critical tasks were to be performed on the Ganz Mavag fleet" (4.2.1)). The absence of such documentation and the reliance on institutional knowledge over formal procedures increased the risk of maintenance errors ("depot management had relied on the institutional knowledge and experience of its staff to conduct proper maintenance" (4.2.1)).

Safety-Critical System Identification and Checks
The failure to systematically assess and identify safety-critical systems and their components, as well as the lack of mandatory checks by independent personnel, is another safety theme. The braking system is a safety-critical system, and a simple check by an appropriate person could have prevented the accident ("A simple check by an appropriate person to confirm that the split pins had been inserted in the hanger bolts would have prevented this accident" (4.2.2)). The absence of such systematic assessments and checks allowed the omission of the split pins to go unnoticed, leading to the derailment ("no systematic assessment had been undertaken to identify safety-critical systems and their components" (4.2.3)).

Emergency Response and Risk Management
The emergency response to the accident and the balance between immediate assistance and the risks associated with a derailed train in contact with a high-voltage overhead traction contact wire is a safety theme. The Commission concluded that the emergency response was appropriate under the circumstances, highlighting the importance of risk management during such events ("For first responders to a train accident there will inevitably be a delicate balance between the need to provide assistance immediately and the risks associated with a derailed train in contact with a high-voltage overhead traction contact wire" (4.1.6)). The driver's initiative to lower the pantographs and the delayed evacuation until the overhead traction line was isolated and earthed demonstrate effective risk management practices ("the driver took the initiative to lower the pantographs that connected the train to the overhead line" (4.1.7)).

Maintenance Standards and Best Engineering Practices
Adherence to maintenance standards and best engineering practices is a critical safety theme. The accident revealed issues with the standard of maintenance for a safety-critical braking system and the need for procedures to ensure maintenance is conducted according to best engineering practices ("The safety issues arising from this accident relates to the standard of maintenance for a safety-critical braking system" (4.1.8)). The Commission's previous recommendations for the Auckland metro maintenance depot, which included adhering to engineering standards and following manufacturers' instructions, are equally applicable to the Wellington depot, indicating a broader issue with maintenance practices across different locations ("The previous recommendation to address the Auckland situation is equally applicable to the safety issue identified with the Wellington metro maintenance depot" (4.2.5)).

Independent Verification of Maintenance Work
The absence of independent verification of maintenance work on safety-critical systems is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. There was no requirement for work on such systems to be checked and signed off by people not directly involved in the work, which could have detected or prevented the omission of the split pins ("no requirement for work on safety-critical systems, and their components, to be checked and signed off by people not directly involved in the work" (5.4)). The need for independent checks is underscored by the fact that such a process would likely have caught the error before the coach was released to service, preventing the derailment ("Had there been it is highly likely that the omission would have been avoided, or at least detected and rectified, before the coach was released to service" (5.4)).

Institutional Knowledge vs. Formal Training
The reliance on institutional knowledge instead of formal training and documented procedures is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The maintenance depot's dependence on the experience of its staff without formalized procedures increased the risk of critical maintenance steps being overlooked ("depot management had relied on the institutional knowledge and experience of its staff to conduct proper maintenance" (4.2.1)). This reliance on institutional knowledge is problematic because it does not provide a consistent and reliable method for ensuring that all safety-critical tasks are completed correctly, as evidenced by the omission that led to the derailment.
Themes for 2010_005: 
Simultaneous Opposed Circuits
The simultaneous use of opposed circuits is a safety theme that was identified as a contributing factor in the incident. The controller expected the aeroplane to fly a left-hand pattern which could lead to a conflict with the helicopter's right-hand circuit. The controller mitigated this risk by informing the aeroplane pilots that the helicopter was in a right-hand circuit and asking if they had it in sight before clearing them for the joining procedure. However, the potential for conflict was not fully managed, as the controller did not instruct the aeroplane pilots to 'pass behind the helicopter' or to join for a right-hand circuit, which could have avoided the identified potential conflict (4.8-4.9). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risks associated with having aircraft operate in opposing traffic patterns without clear management of the associated collision risks.

See-and-Avoid Principle
The limitations of the see-and-avoid principle for collision avoidance is another safety theme. The incident depended on the pilots of both aircraft applying the see-and-avoid principle, especially the pilots of the aeroplane keeping the helicopter in sight. However, both aeroplane pilots lost sight of the helicopter and continued with the procedure without advising each other or ATC (4.25-4.30). This theme is relevant as it underscores the inherent limitations of relying solely on visual detection for collision avoidance, particularly when one aircraft loses sight of the other.

ATC Traffic Information and Instructions
Misinterpretation of ATC traffic information and instructions is a safety theme that played a role in the incident. The controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace, but he did not manage the increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane descending to circuit altitude in the opposite direction (5.1). Additionally, some VFR pilots continue to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in Class C and D airspace as the provision of traffic separation (5.10). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of clear communication and understanding between ATC and pilots regarding traffic management and the level of separation provided.

Non-Standard Traffic Situations
The ambiguity in interpreting Civil Aviation Rule 91.223 in non-standard traffic situations is a safety theme. The rule can be interpreted ambiguously, which could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes (5.3). This theme is relevant because it indicates that the existing rules may not be sufficiently clear to guide pilots' actions in situations where one aircraft is operating in a non-standard circuit, as was the case in this incident.

Overhead Circuit Joining Procedure
The correct interpretation and application of the overhead circuit joining procedure is a safety theme. There was potential for misinterpretation of the procedure due to the subtle distinction between the direction of the traffic circuit and the general circuit procedure (4.20-4.24). This theme is relevant because it suggests that pilots may not have a consistent understanding of how to join a circuit safely, particularly when preceding traffic is operating in a non-standard pattern.

Participation in Local Aerodrome User Groups
The benefit of participation in local aerodrome user groups is a safety theme. Such groups provide information about their respective activities, which can help manage operational risks (5.8). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of information sharing and collaboration among aerodrome users to enhance situational awareness and safety. In this incident, the helicopter instructor's lack of participation in the user group may have contributed to a lack of awareness of helicopter characteristics among other aerodrome users (4.33).
Themes for 2016_201: 
Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
Fire detection and alarm systems are critical for early identification of a fire, which allows for timely evacuation and firefighting efforts. In the case of the PeeJay V, the vessel "very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed" (4.3 (invalid formatted quote)), which is a significant safety issue. The absence of such systems meant that "the crew had less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life-saving apparatus" (5.2). This lack of early detection systems contributed to the severity of the incident by delaying the crew's response to the fire.

CO2 Fire Suppression System Effectiveness
The effectiveness of CO2 fire suppression systems is contingent upon the ability to seal the protected space to prevent the escape of CO2 and the re-entry of air. In this incident, the CO2 system "could not be fully effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed down" (4.4). The engine room had multiple points where air could enter, such as ventilation flaps that were not closed and ducts without closure mechanisms (4.4.6). This compromised the integrity of the CO2 system and allowed the fire to reignite, demonstrating a critical safety issue in the vessel's design and firefighting preparedness.

Crew Training and Familiarity with Safety Systems
Adequate crew training and familiarity with onboard safety systems are essential for effective emergency response. The crew of the PeeJay V "did not fully appreciate the principles underlying how a fixed fire-fighting co2 flooding systems works" (4.6 (invalid formatted quote)), which is a safety issue that affected their ability to respond to the fire. Their limited understanding of the CO2 system's operation meant they "lacked the knowledge to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire" (5.4). This lack of training and understanding hindered their ability to effectively use the CO2 system to suppress the fire.

Vessel Construction and Compartmentalization
The construction of a vessel plays a crucial role in fire safety, particularly the ability to compartmentalize and contain a fire. In the PeeJay V incident, the construction of the engine room "did not allow the compartment to be fully sealed, which rendered the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system ineffective" (5.3). The presence of ducts and openings that could not be sealed compromised the fire integrity of the engine room (4.5.4). This safety issue highlights the importance of considering fire containment in the design and construction of vessels.

Life-Saving Equipment Accessibility
The accessibility of life-saving equipment is paramount during an emergency evacuation. For the PeeJay V, the speed of the fire's spread obstructed access to life-jackets and the Carley float, which "could not be accessed" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). The life-jackets were stored in locations that became quickly filled with smoke, preventing the crew from distributing them to passengers (4.7.5). This incident underscores the safety theme of ensuring life-saving equipment is stored in such a way that it remains accessible in all foreseeable emergencies.

Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards
Compliance with maritime safety regulations and standards is intended to minimize the risk of accidents. However, the PeeJay V incident reveals a safety issue where "maritime rules do not require fire detection or automatic fire alarms to be fitted on board a restricted-limits vessel less than 24 metres" (4.3.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This regulatory gap meant that the vessel was not equipped with fire detection systems despite the significant risk posed by a fire on board. The accident highlights the need for a review and potential enhancement of maritime safety regulations to better protect passengers and crew.
Themes for 2015_007: 
Organisational Oversight and Compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
Organisational oversight refers to the responsibility of senior management to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with established rules and regulations. In the context of this accident, the operator's senior management failed to provide effective oversight of compliance systems and processes, particularly in relation to pilot training and supervision. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had identified significant non-compliances with the operator's training system and managerial oversight, which should have warranted intervention before the accident occurred. The report states that "the operator's system for training its pilots was ill-defined and did not comply fully with the civil aviation rules" (4.8 (invalid formatted quote)) and "the operator's training system did not have sufficient oversight by the designated senior persons" (5.9). Furthermore, the CAA had "identified significant and repetitive non-compliance issues with the operator's training system and managerial oversight that warranted intervention long before this accident occurred" (5.10).

Pilot Training and Experience
Pilot training and experience are critical to ensuring that pilots are capable of making safe operational decisions and handling unexpected situations during flight. In this accident, the pilot was not properly trained and lacked the appropriate level of experience expected under the operator's categorisation scheme to fulfill the role and responsibilities of a senior (A-category) pilot. The report highlights that "the pilot had not been properly trained and did not have the appropriate level of experience expected under the operator's categorisation scheme to fulfil the role and responsibilities expected of a senior (A-category) pilot in this type of operation" (5.7). This lack of training and experience was a contributing factor to the accident, as the pilot was prematurely put in a position to make operational decisions unchecked (4.7.5).

Weight and Balance Compliance
Weight and balance compliance is essential for the safe operation of an aircraft, as it affects the aircraft's performance and handling characteristics. The report indicates that throughout the flight, the all-up weight of the helicopter almost certainly exceeded the maximum permitted weight (5.2). This non-compliance with weight and balance limits could have restricted the pilot's options for maneuvering the helicopter at low speed (4.3.22) and contributed to the accident by affecting the helicopter's performance.

Weather Conditions and Decision Making
Weather conditions play a significant role in aviation safety, particularly for visual flight rules (VFR) operations. The weather on the day of the accident was unstable and unsuitable for conducting a scenic flight, with localized conditions likely frequently below the minimum criteria required by the Civil Aviation Rules (5.5). The pilot's decision to continue the flight under such conditions was imprudent (4.4.9), and it is very likely that when the helicopter took off from Chancellor Shelf, the pilot's perception of the helicopter's height above the terrain was affected by adverse weather conditions (5.6).

Regulatory Surveillance and Enforcement
Regulatory surveillance and enforcement are necessary to ensure that aviation operators adhere to safety standards and regulations. In this case, the CAA's surveillance activity failed to ensure that deficiencies identified in the operator's compliance were formally recorded and addressed. The report criticizes the CAA for not taking appropriate action to either cause change or remove the threat from the system before an accident occurs, stating that "the CAA cannot reasonably be expected to ensure total compliance by all participants in the sector. However, its surveillance activity should ensure that where deficiencies are found they are formally recorded so that regulatory decisions can be informed" (4.7.3). The lack of decisive action by the CAA allowed the operator to continue with little change to improve its training and management system (4.7.4).

Visual Cues and Spatial Disorientation
Visual cues are essential for pilots to maintain orientation and control of the aircraft, especially during VFR operations. Spatial disorientation can occur when visual cues are lost or obscured, leading to a loss of control. The report suggests that the pilot likely lost awareness of the helicopter's height above the glacier due to conditions such as cloud, precipitation, flat light conditions, or condensation on the windscreen (5.6). This loss of visual reference could have led to the pilot's inability to avoid a collision with the terrain.
Themes for 2019_002: 
Visual Identification and Confirmation Bias
Visual identification is a critical aspect of maintaining separation during visual approaches. In this incident, the flight crew of LINK285 misidentified an A320 as the aircraft they were supposed to follow, which was actually a Dash-8. This misidentification was influenced by confirmation bias, where the crew looked for information that supported their preconceptions and ignored conflicting data. "The flight crew in LINK285 looked ahead for LINK235 where they expected it to be and saw an aeroplane. They agreed it was LINK235 but they had likely experienced confirmation bias" (3.36). This theme is relevant because it highlights the human factors and perceptual challenges that can lead to serious incidents, emphasizing the need for robust verification processes and cross-checking of visual identifications.

Situational Awareness in Visual Approaches
Situational awareness is crucial for pilots conducting visual approaches under IFR conditions. The flight crew's ability to maintain awareness of their position in the landing sequence is essential for safe operations. In this case, the flight crew lacked complete situational awareness of the aircraft sequence, which contributed to the incident. "The flight crew of LINK285 had not developed a complete mental image of other aircraft relative to their own position in the landing pattern before they took over responsibility for maintaining their visual separation from the aeroplane they had identified ahead" (4.4). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of situational awareness and the potential consequences when it is compromised.

Communication and Radio Frequency Management
Effective communication and proper radio frequency management are vital for air traffic control and flight crew coordination. In this incident, the approach controller was unable to establish immediate communication with LINK285 after they changed to the tower frequency, which delayed the resolution of the conflict. "By allowing a flight crew on a visual approach to change radio frequency at their discretion, based on other clearance actions, meant the approach controller was unable to establish immediate communication with an aircraft within their control sector" (4.8). This theme is relevant because it highlights the procedural gaps that can lead to a loss of communication at critical moments, increasing the risk of incidents.

Use of Available Resources and Systems
The use of available resources and systems, such as Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS), is a key safety theme. In this incident, the flight crew did not utilize the TCAS to validate their visual identification of the aircraft they were following. "Further resources, such as Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems and the air traffic control guidance available to the flight crew to help validate their mental models of their situation, were not used" (4.6). This theme is relevant as it points to the importance of using all available systems and resources to ensure safety and prevent reliance solely on visual identification, which can be fallible.

Preservation of Evidence
The preservation of evidence, particularly cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, is essential for post-incident investigations and learning. In this incident, the CVR recordings were not protected immediately after the incident, resulting in the loss of critical voice recordings. "After this serious incident, neither the flight crews from LINK235 and LINK285 nor the operator's ground crew isolated the cockpit voice recorders immediately after the incident flight" (4.9). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the procedural and regulatory requirements for preserving evidence and the consequences of failing to do so, which can hinder investigation efforts and the opportunity to learn from incidents.

Air Traffic Control Procedures and Information Provision
Air traffic control (ATC) procedures and the provision of information to flight crews are fundamental to maintaining safe operations. In this incident, the approach controller did not provide the flight crew with their position in the landing sequence, which is crucial information for maintaining situational awareness during a visual approach. "The current air traffic rules are inconsistent on the minimum information controllers are required to provide to pilots conducting a visual approach" (3.43). This theme is relevant as it identifies the need for consistent and comprehensive information provision by ATC to flight crews, particularly during visual approaches where the flight crew is responsible for maintaining separation.
Themes for 2016_204: 
Passage Planning
Passage planning is the process of developing a comprehensive, step-by-step navigational plan from berth to berth, including any necessary course changes, speed adjustments, and considerations for environmental conditions. This theme is relevant to the accident because the vessel's bridge team and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of a common passage plan before the pilotage began, leading to different understandings of the planned track and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan. "Consequently, the pilot and the vessel's bridge team had different understandings of the planned track to be followed and their respective roles in monitoring against the plan" (4.1.2). Additionally, the IMO has set standards for passage planning that vessels must adhere to, but there is no corresponding requirement for the passage plans that pilots create and use to meet those same standards (4.1.2).

Bridge Resource Management (BRM)
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) refers to the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. This theme is significant in the context of the accident because the standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice. "The standard of BRM on board the Molly Manx during the Otago pilotage did not meet good industry practice" (4.1.2). The bridge team, including the pilot, did not effectively monitor the vessel's progress, and there was a lack of communication and challenge among the team members, which could have prevented the grounding (4.5.1, 4.5.6).

Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) Configuration
The Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) is a computer-based navigation system that complies with IMO regulations and can be used as an alternative to paper navigation charts. The relevance of this theme to the accident is highlighted by the fact that the crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred. "The crew were not using the ECDIS in the correct configuration required by the IMO and company standards when the grounding occurred" (4.1.2). The ECDIS safety settings were not appropriate for the intended passage into Port Otago, and the cross-track distance alarm would not activate until the vessel was significantly outside the channel (4.4.4).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves the perception of environmental elements, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. It is a critical component of safe navigation. In this accident, the grounding occurred because the bridge team, including the pilot, lost situational awareness and did not realize that the vessel had deviated so far starboard of the intended track. "The grounding occurred because the bridge team, including the pilot, lost situational awareness and did not realise that the vessel had deviated so far starboard of the intended track" (5.1). The pilot and bridge team were not effectively monitoring the vessel's progress by all available means, contributing to the loss of situational awareness (5.2).

Pilot Integration into Bridge Team
The integration of a pilot into the bridge team is crucial for ensuring that the pilot and the vessel's officers work together effectively during pilotage. This theme is relevant because, in this case, the pilot was not fully integrated into the bridge organization, which affected the cohesion of the team and their shared understanding of the passage plan. "At this stage the pilot needs to be fully integrated into the bridge organisation so that the whole team works as a cohesive body and has a shared understanding of the passage plan" (4.3.1). The lack of a shared understanding and the absence of the OOW and helmsman from the briefing with the pilot contributed to the ineffective BRM (4.5.2).

Communication and Challenge
Effective communication and the willingness to challenge decisions are key aspects of a well-functioning bridge team. This theme is relevant to the accident because there was a failure in communication and challenge among the bridge team members. Neither the master nor the officer of the watch spoke up when they noticed the vessel was off track, missing an opportunity to avert the grounding. "Neither the master nor the officer of the watch speaking up when they both noticed that the vessel was to starboard of the track according to their passage plan was a lost opportunity to avert the grounding" (5.5). The pilot also expressed that he was working very much on his own, indicating a lack of active engagement from the bridge team (4.5.5).
Themes for 2018_001: 
Reserve Parachute Malfunction
The reserve parachute malfunction is a critical safety theme in this accident. The reserve parachute developed a tension knot during deployment, which the tandem master was unable to clear, leading to a deformed canopy and an uncontrolled descent. "The reserve parachute developed a tension knot as it opened that the tandem master was unable to clear. The tension knot deformed the right rear part of the canopy, and this resulted in the tandem pair descending in a steep, right-hand spiral turn until they struck the water at Lake Wakatipu" (4.3). The cause of the tension knot could not be conclusively determined, highlighting the unpredictability and severity of such malfunctions in parachute operations (4.4).

Inadequate Emergency Response Plan
The operator's emergency response plan did not account for the minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water, making it an important safety theme. "The operator's plan did not ensure parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for survival in the conditions, nor did it have a vessel to implement such a recovery" (3.82). The water temperature, which was about 10° Celsius, limited the likely survival time of the tandem pair, and the operator's water emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of their entering the water at Lake Wakatipu (3.83, 3.84).

Lifejacket Serviceability and Maintenance
The serviceability and maintenance of lifejackets are a safety theme due to the operator's lack of a maintenance and inspection program for lifejackets. "The operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets to ensure they remained in a serviceable condition" (4.8). The tandem rider's lifejacket could not be inflated sufficiently to support the rider's head above water, and the reason for the lifejacket not inflating fully could not be conclusively determined (4.6, 4.7).

Parachute Packing Technique
The parachute packing technique is a safety theme as it likely contributed to the asymmetric inflation of the main parachute, leading to a line twist and subsequent malfunction. "the main parachute's packing likely contributed to its opening asymmetrically" (4.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The Commission was unable to determine with any certainty if the way the reserve parachute was packed influenced the formation of the tension knots in the reserve parachute's lines (3.65).

Lack of Regulatory Clarity for Water Operations
The lack of regulatory clarity for operations near significant bodies of water is a safety theme because the Civil Aviation Rules for parachuting near a significant body of water are not well defined. "The Civil Aviation Rules for parachuting near a significant body of water are not well defined in Part 105" (5.7). This lack of clarity can lead to procedures implemented by Part 115 parachute operators that do not meet minimum levels of safety (5.7).

Data Collection and Reporting for Parachuting Occurrences
Data collection and reporting for parachuting occurrences is a safety theme as the CAA dataset for parachuting occurrences did not include key fields, reducing its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector. "The Civil Aviation Authority dataset for parachuting occurrences did not include key fields, which likely reduced its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector" (4.13). The mismatch between submitted occurrence data from operators and the reduced subset of data recorded by the CAA was a lost opportunity for the CAA to gain national insights into the safety performance of the parachute sector (3.89).
Themes for 2018_202: 
Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
The fire detection and alarm systems are a critical safety theme in this accident because they failed to detect the fire and sound the general alarm, which delayed the firefighting response. The document states that "the fire-detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm" (3.12) and that "the crew responsible for testing the fire alarm system explained that the fire alarms were 'tested', but they were unable to describe anything that resembled a routine regime for checking that all components of the fire alarm system were functional" (3.14). This indicates that the fire detection and alarm systems, which are supposed to alert the crew early to enable a swift response, did not operate as intended, contributing to the severity of the incident.

Crew Response and Firefighting Procedures
The crew's response to the fire and the firefighting procedures they followed are another safety theme, as some aspects of the crew's response did not meet industry good practice. The report highlights that "some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice" (3.3) and that "the crew's response to the fire did not comply fully with company procedures and good industry practice" (4.3). This suggests that the crew's actions, or lack thereof, were not in line with established protocols, which could have mitigated the fire's impact had they been followed correctly.

Fire-Resistant Design and Construction
Fire-resistant design and construction is a safety theme because the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701 did not meet contemporary standards, which was a factor in the rapid spread of the fire. The report indicates that "the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701, although complying with the relevant Maritime Rule, did not meet contemporary standards" (4.4) and that "the internal corridor bulkheads and cabin doors on the Dong Won 701 were of hardboard or similar wood-product construction and suffered complete combustion in the fire" (3.38). This lack of contemporary fire-resistant design and construction allowed the fire to spread more quickly and intensely.

Application of Maritime Rules
The application of Maritime Rules, specifically Rule 40D, is a safety theme because inconsistencies in its application may have resulted in vessels not fully complying with the relevant safety standards. The report states that "inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D: Design, Construction and Equipment - Fishing Ships may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards" (3.3) and that "due to the inconsistency of how maritime rules part 40d was applied to ships entered into the new zealand fishing ship register after 2004, there are up to 12 ships that likely do not meet the standards required of the rule" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This indicates that the inconsistent application of safety rules could lead to vessels being less safe than intended.

Grandparent Rights and Vessel Age
Grandparent rights and the age of vessels are a safety theme because older vessels are allowed to operate without meeting contemporary safety standards, potentially putting crews at greater risk. The document mentions that "a further 50 fishing vessels have been afforded grandparent rights that will allow them to operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards under the current maritime rules" (3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) and that "an adverse effect of applying grandparent rights to older standards is that the crews are not afforded the same level of safety" (3.36). This suggests that the practice of grandparent rights may compromise safety by permitting outdated safety standards to persist.

Emergency Preparedness and Training
Emergency preparedness and training is a safety theme because, despite the crew having received approved shore-based firefighting training, their actions during the emergency suggest that training and preparedness were insufficient. The report notes that "the crew of the Dong Won 701 had all received approved shore-based firefighting training" (3.20), yet "several important procedures were not followed" (3.21) and "this uncoordinated response to the fire continued until FENZ arrived and took command of the scene" (3.26). This indicates that the crew's training did not translate into effective action during the actual emergency.
Themes for 2013_102: 
Door Alert System Design
The design of the door alert system is a safety theme because it relies on a single white light to indicate the safe condition of all passenger doors being closed, which is not in line with the conventional color coding of red for danger and green for safe. The absence of a red light to indicate an unsafe condition, such as open doors, failed to alert the trainee that the doors were open when the train departed ("The extinguished passenger door-status light on the driver's control panel failed to alert the trainee sufficiently that the doors were open when the train departed Wingate station" (5.2)). This design choice dates back to the first electric multiple unit sets and has been replicated in subsequent models for consistency, but this incident demonstrates that it can lead to misinterpretation or failure to recognize door status lights (4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.7).

Interlocking Systems
The absence of an interlocking system on the Ganz Mavag sets, which would prevent the train from being powered up with any operational passenger doors still open, is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The newer Matangi sets have such interlocks, and the incident would not have occurred had an interlock been fitted to the Ganz Mavag sets ("This incident would not have occurred had an interlock been fitted to the Ganz Mavag sets" (4.1.4)). The reliance on driver performance and the door-alert system design due to the absence of interlocks on the Ganz Mavag sets is a significant safety issue (4.1.5).

Crew Communication Equipment
The availability and use of communication equipment for train crews is a safety theme, as the train manager and assistant train manager were left on the platform without a radio to make immediate contact with the trainee to stop the train ("Once the train manager and assistant train manager were left on the platform, they had no radio by which they could make immediate contact with the trainee to stop the train" (4.1.7)). The recommendation for train managers to be provided with portable radios was not fully implemented by Tranz Metro, which preferred to have radios permanently installed on charging units near the drivers' cabs and issued mobile phones to train managers instead (4.3.4, 4.3.5). This policy limited the train crew's ability to manage effectively an emergency on board their own train (4.3.6).

Training and Oversight
The training and oversight of trainee drivers is a safety theme, as the trainee had practiced the departure procedure many times before without recorded issues, but still failed to notice the door-status light was not illuminated, which could be attributed to inexperience (4.1.3). The minder driver's oversight was deemed appropriate for the stage of the trainee's training program, but Tranz Metro still implemented safety initiatives to improve the training program following the incident (4.1.6). This suggests that the training and oversight procedures in place may not have been sufficient to prevent the incident.

Operational Procedures
The adherence to and design of operational procedures are safety themes, as the trainee powered up the train without having received the required right-away signal from the train manager (5.1). The right-away procedures were similar for different train sets, but the absence of an interlock on the Ganz Mavag sets placed greater reliance on these procedures being followed correctly (4.1.4, 4.1.5). The incident highlights the importance of robust operational procedures that are less dependent on individual performance.

Emergency Response
The ability of train crews to respond to emergencies is a safety theme, as the incident showed that the train managers were unable to quickly and effectively communicate with the trainee to stop the train once they were left on the platform (4.3.7). The recommendation for train crews to be able to communicate quickly and effectively in any emergency situation was not fully realized due to the policy of not carrying portable radios (4.3.8). This limitation in emergency response capability is a safety issue that needs to be addressed to ensure train crews can manage emergencies effectively.
Themes for 2019_006: 
Situational Awareness and 'See and Avoid' Principle
Situational awareness is crucial for pilots, especially in uncontrolled airspace where they are solely responsible for maintaining safe separation from other aircraft. The 'see and avoid' principle is the primary defense against mid-air collisions in such airspace. In this accident, the pilot of ZK-WAK likely never saw ZK-CBY approaching, and the pilot of ZK-CBY did not see ZK-WAK in time to take action to avoid the collision. This indicates a breakdown in situational awareness and the effectiveness of the 'see and avoid' principle, which is a recurring safety theme in aviation accidents ("the pilot of ZK-WAK would very likely have been looking forward and focusing on preparing to land, not back and to the right" (3.18), "the pilot of ZK-CBY's view of ZK-WAK would have been obscured by the aeroplane's engine cowling" (3.20)).

Non-Standard Procedures and Non-Compliance
Non-compliance with established procedures and the adoption of non-standard practices can significantly increase the risk of accidents. In this case, the pilot of ZK-CBY was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, which had become an accepted practice at the aerodrome. This non-compliance was not challenged or reported, leading to its normalization and increasing the risk of an accident for pilots who were not familiar with the ad hoc procedure ("The pilot of ZK-CBY was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, as this was how the pilot had been instructed to join" (4.3), "Local pilots were aware of the non-standard join, which had become accepted practice on the aerodrome" (4.4)).

Radio Communication and Traffic Awareness
Effective radio communication is essential for traffic awareness and collision avoidance. In this accident, both pilots made appropriate radio calls, but neither pilot responded to the other's calls, indicating they either did not consider the other aircraft a threat or were not actively listening. This lack of response and the failure to use radio communication to clarify positions or intentions contributed to the collision ("The calls from ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not interfere with any of the other calls and suggest that the two pilots were able to hear radio transmissions from other aircraft" (3.22), "That the calls made by the pilots of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not elicit any response from each other indicates that the pilots either did not consider the other aeroplane to be a threat or they were not actively listening to the content of the calls" (3.24)).

Oversight and Regulatory Compliance
The level of regulatory oversight and support for non-certificated aerodromes is less than for certificated aerodromes, leading to potential safety risks. The investigation found that non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules (CARs) was more prevalent at unattended aerodromes, and there was a lack of communication between regulatory bodies regarding the responsibilities and support required for the safe operation of these aerodromes ("Non-certificated aerodromes and aerodrome managers did not have the same level of regulatory oversight and support as certificated aerodromes" (4.12), "There was no communication between CAA and other regulatory and local bodies as to the responsibilities and support required for the safe operation of unattended aerodromes, their operators and managers" (4.13)).

Pilot Training and Qualifications
Adequate pilot training and meeting qualification requirements are fundamental to aviation safety. In this incident, the pilot of ZK-CBY did not meet the flight time requirement for a commercial parachute drop rating, which, while not a direct contributing factor to the collision, highlights the importance of ensuring pilots are fully qualified for the operations they are conducting ("The pilot of ZK-CBY did not meet the flight time requirement for the issue of a commercial parachute drop rating, but this was almost certainly not a contributing cause of the mid-air collision" (4.2)).

Incident Reporting and Safety Culture
A robust safety culture includes the willingness to report incidents and manage risks. The under-reporting of incidents at uncontrolled aerodromes and the passive acceptance of non-compliant behavior at Masterton indicate a deficient safety culture. This lack of reporting and acceptance of non-standard practices can lead to an increased risk of accidents, especially for those unfamiliar with local ad hoc procedures ("The passive acceptance of the non-compliant behaviour, the absence of proactive safety reporting and the resistance to adopting an aerodrome SMS indicate that the safety culture at Masterton was deficient" (3.39), "Should a non-compliant action or procedure go unchallenged or be accepted it risks becoming normalised" (3.43)).
Themes for 2011_204: 
Inadequate Passage Planning and Watchkeeping Standards
Inadequate passage planning and watchkeeping standards were a significant safety theme related to the Rena accident. The Rena's passage plan from Napier to Tauranga did not meet the standards documented in the CIEL safety management system, the International Maritime Organization Voyage Planning Guidelines, or best industry practice as documented in The Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - A Practical Guide. The second mate deviated from the passage plan to take the Rena closer to Astrolabe Reef to save time, which unnecessarily increased the risk of the ship running aground and contributed directly to the grounding. The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena for the accident voyage, particularly during the watch period when the grounding occurred, did not comply with the requirements of the STCW Convention, the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines, the CIEL safety management system, or industry best practice ("the rena's passage plan from napier to tauranga on the accident voyage did not meet the standards documented in the ciel safety management system or the international maritime organization voyage planning guidelines" (4.2.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the second mate deviated from the passage plan to take the rena closer to astrolabe reef to save time" (4.2.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the standard of watchkeeping on board the rena for the accident voyage, and particularly for the watch period during which the grounding occurred, in almost all respects did not comply with the requirements of the stcw convention" (4.2)).

Fatigue Management
Fatigue management was another safety theme relevant to the accident. The master's work and sleep schedule in the days preceding the accident placed him at risk of impaired cognitive performance due to fatigue. The second mate's work and sleep schedule also indicated at least a mild to moderate risk of cognitive performance impairment due to fatigue. The performance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period leading up to the grounding, although there was insufficient evidence to determine whether their actions leading up to the grounding were attributable to fatigue ("the master's work and sleep schedule in the three days preceding the accident placed him at risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue" (4.4.10 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the second mate's work and sleep schedule in the three days before the accident meant that there was, at least, a mild to moderate risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue" (4.4.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Deficiencies in Safety Management Systems
Deficiencies in safety management systems were a critical safety theme in this accident. The crew of the Rena were not following navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the safety management system onboard the Rena for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding. The number of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena and its detention for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicate that the safety management system as applied onboard the Rena was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code ("the master and crew of the rena were not following navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the safety management system onboard the rena for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding" (4.5), "the number of port state control deficiencies identified against the rena and its detention in fremantle for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicate that the safety management system as applied onboard the rena was not meeting the objectives of the ism code" (5.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Inadequate Seafarer Training and Certification Systems
Inadequate seafarer training and certification systems were identified as a safety theme. Independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training, and certification system did not meet the standards specified by the STCW Convention at both systemic and training institute levels. The Liberian Registry recognized by endorsement certificates issued by the Philippines in accordance with STCW Convention Regulation I/10, when independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training, and certification system did not meet the standards specified in the STCW Convention ("Independent audits had found that the Philippine seafarer training system did not meet the standards specified by the STCW Convention at both systemic and training institute levels" (4.6.14), "The Liberian Registry recognised by endorsement certificates issued by the Philippines in accordance with STCW Convention Regulation I/10, when independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training and certification system did not meet the standards specified in the STCW [95] Convention" (4.6.30)).

Lack of Transparency in Seafarer Training Audits
Lack of transparency in seafarer training audits emerged as a safety theme. The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries' maritime education, training, and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess easily whether to recognize the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant with STCW standards. Better transparency of this process could avoid unnecessary duplication and expedite the harmonization of global seafarer training and certification systems ("the stcw convention protocols for auditing countries' maritime education, training and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess easily whether to recognise the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant with stcw convention standards" (4.6.36 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Inadequate Use of Navigational Aids
Inadequate use of navigational aids was a safety theme related to the accident. Although Astrolabe Reef was well displayed as a danger to navigation on the chart being used by the Rena bridge team, the absence of a physical light beacon on the reef was noted as a factor that, if present, likely would have prevented the grounding. The use of modern and accurate navigation systems for avoiding such navigational dangers, and the potential for future advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation, were also discussed ("a light beacon placed on astrolabe reef is another measure that probably would have alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of astrolabe reef, and would likely have prevented the rena grounding" (4.9), "the use of virtual aids to navigation could be one alternative method for highlighting dangers to navigation" (4.9.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
Themes for 2014_104: 
Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme related to this accident. The accident was precipitated by a "breakdown in communication at the work area assembly point" (4.2.3). The rail protection officer assumed that the work group overheard his authorization for the train to pass through the work area, and his 'thumbs up' signal was misinterpreted by the excavator driver as an indication to begin work (4.2.3, 4.2.4). This miscommunication directly led to the excavator being on the track when the train arrived, resulting in the collision.

Non-Adherence to Safety Procedures
Non-adherence to established safety procedures is another theme that is highly relevant to this accident. The report identifies "non-compliance with KiwiRail's procedures by the track maintenance work group and the network authority" (4.3.19). Specifically, the rail protection officer did not follow the correct procedure when extending the 'clear by' time for track occupation (4.3.12), and a pre-shift safety briefing, which is a KiwiRail operating rule, was not held on the day of the accident (4.3.10). These deviations from standard operating procedures contributed to the unsafe conditions that led to the accident.

Inadequate Planning and Resourcing
Inadequate planning and resourcing of the work group is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. The planning stage of the work assignment failed to follow KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures, resulting in the work group being under-resourced to manage the protection and safety of the track maintenance workers effectively (4.3.4-4.3.6). This lack of resources left the rail protection officer with the unrealistic task of managing the safety of all personnel within a 7.5-kilometre-long work area (4.3.6).

Training and Certification Lapses
Training and certification lapses are a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The excavator driver had not undergone a safety observation by KiwiRail personnel since 2010, and therefore his qualification was deemed to have expired (4.3.17). This lack of current certification and potentially inadequate training may have affected the excavator driver's understanding of safety protocols and contributed to the accident.

Ineffective Use of Safety Equipment
The ineffective use of safety equipment is a theme that emerged from this accident. The excavator driver was not wearing the seatbelt fitted to the excavator, which was confirmed by the train driver and the attending police officer (4.2.8). Had the seatbelt been worn, "the severity of his injuries would have been reduced" (4.2.8). This highlights the importance of using safety equipment properly to mitigate the consequences of accidents.

Vulnerability to Procedural Failures
The vulnerability of controls to procedural failures is a safety theme identified by the NZ Transport Agency's investigation into the accident (4.3.20). The investigation concluded that the failings fell into categories including "the vulnerability of controls to procedural failures" (4.3.20). This theme encompasses the various instances where procedures were not followed or were insufficient to prevent the accident, indicating a systemic issue with the robustness of safety controls in place.
Themes for 2013_108: 
Signal Compliance and Automatic Protection
Signal compliance and the lack of automatic protection systems are central safety themes in this accident. The passenger train passed Signal 38 at red, which indicates a failure in signal compliance by the train driver ("Twenty seconds later the passenger train passed Signal 38 at red while travelling at 42 km/h with 15% braking applied" (4.2.1.8)). Additionally, the absence of an automatic signal trip device at Signal 38 meant there was no system in place to automatically stop the train in the event of such a signal breach ("Signal 38 was not equipped with a signal trip device, so in the event of an overrun there was no automatic means of stopping a train before it reached the crossover points" (3.2.4)).

Driver Distraction
Driver distraction is a significant safety theme in this incident. The driver of the passenger train was engaged in a conversation with the train manager, which led to missing the red signal at Signal 38 ("He also acknowledged that the reason for his not noticing the red signal was his becoming engrossed in his conversation with the train manager" (3.1.2)). This distraction is a recognized issue, as KiwiRail's records indicated that 42% of signals passed at red were partly or wholly attributable to driver distraction (3.3.3).

Signaller Vigilance
The vigilance of the signaller was a critical safety theme that prevented the collision. Upon noticing the passenger train's failure to stop at Signal 38, the signaller immediately broadcast an urgent message to the train driver to stop, which led to the train halting before a collision could occur ("Meanwhile the signaller saw on his mimic screen that the passenger train had failed to stop at Signal 38. He immediately broadcast an urgent message over the local radio channel for the passenger train driver to stop his train" (4.2.1.9)).


Risk Management at Converging Lines
The management of risk at converging lines is a safety theme highlighted by this incident. The near collision occurred at a point where several busy metro passenger lines converge, which is a natural area of conflict requiring careful management ("The near collision occurred at the convergence of several busy metro passenger lines and there was no automatic protection applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a driver failing to stop at Signal 38" (3.1.5, 4.2.1)). The report suggests that this area lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent collisions in the event of human error.

Adherence to Operating Rules
Adherence to operating rules is a safety theme that was breached in this incident. KiwiRail's operating rules explicitly state that non-operational conversations with train drivers should be avoided to prevent distraction ("Locomotive Engineers must not participate in an attempted conversation where it is unsafe to do so. Conversations must be brief and confined to essential or urgent operating matters only" (3.3.1)). The driver and train manager's engagement in conversation was contrary to these rules, contributing to the near miss.

Post-Incident Procedures and Testing
The implementation of post-incident procedures and testing is a safety theme that was followed in this case. After the incident, the driver and train manager were relieved of their duties and underwent drug and alcohol testing, which returned negative results ("The driver and train manager on the passenger train were relieved of their duties. Both underwent post-incident drug and alcohol testing in accordance with KiwiRail's procedures, and both returned negative results" (4.2.1.10)). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the organization's commitment to safety and adherence to protocols following a safety-related incident.
Themes for 2017_203: 
Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
The maintenance and inspection regimes for pressure vessels on board ships are a critical safety theme related to this accident. The nitrogen cylinder that burst was "overdue for maintenance and testing, and should not have been in service at the time of the accident" (4.1.2). The maintenance schedule was calendar-based, and the hydrostatic pressure testing of nitrogen cylinders was scheduled every 10 years, but the failed cylinder was overdue for testing by one year and five months (4.3.4). This indicates that the maintenance and inspection schedules were not adequately followed or enforced, leading to the use of equipment that was not fit for purpose. Additionally, the maintenance regime did not detect the severe corrosion that weakened the cylinder (4.2.1), highlighting the inadequacy of the inspection processes in place.

Corrosion Protection and Environmental Exposure
Corrosion protection and environmental exposure of pressure vessels are significant safety themes in this accident. The cylinder that failed was "severely weakened by corrosion" due to "very little to no protection from sea spray" (4.1.2). The location of the cylinders exposed them to a harsh marine environment, which can accelerate corrosion if not adequately protected (4.4.6). The failure to protect the cylinders from environmental factors and to detect the onset of corrosion through regular and thorough inspections contributed to the accident.

Training and Certification of Inspection Personnel
The training and certification of personnel responsible for inspecting stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders are crucial safety themes. The accident highlighted that "technicians who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and five-yearly inspections of lifeboat-launching installations are not required to have specific training and certification for inspecting any stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders" (4.1.3). The technician who inspected the cylinders prior to the accident did not have the formal training to assess that the cylinder was not fit for purpose and posed a serious safety risk (4.5.5). This lack of specialized training for inspectors could lead to oversight of critical safety issues, as was the case in this incident.

Global Standards for Pressure Cylinder Inspection
The establishment of global minimum standards for the inspection, testing, and rejection of pressure cylinders is a safety theme that emerges from this accident. The analysis identified that "there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy systems on lifeboat launching installations" (4.1.3). This lack of standardized procedures has resulted in "a wide variation in, and in some cases inadequate, standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised service providers" (4.4). The absence of consistent global standards contributed to the failure to identify the compromised condition of the nitrogen cylinder.

Protective Coatings and Material Selection
The use of protective coatings and the selection of materials for pressure vessels are safety themes relevant to this accident. The report suggests that "other options could include the use of better coating and steel protection systems for steel bottles, such as galvanising" (4.3.7). The cylinder that failed was not adequately protected from the corrosive marine environment, leading to severe corrosion and eventual failure (4.2.1). The choice of materials and protective coatings is essential to ensure the longevity and safety of pressure vessels in marine settings.

Inspection and Maintenance Documentation
Proper documentation of inspection and maintenance activities is a safety theme related to this accident. The deck team's cosmetic-focused inspections were not logged as a matter of record, which could mask potential problem areas (4.3.9). The lack of thorough records and documentation of maintenance activities can prevent the detection of issues that may compromise the safety of pressure vessels. The failure to document and address the corrosion on the cylinder that burst indicates a gap in the ship's maintenance practices.
Themes for 2020_101: 
Distracted Driving
Distracted driving is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the truck driver's attention was diverted from the truck's surroundings, leading to the vehicle's slow forward crawl onto the level crossing. The Commission's analysis suggests that the driver was likely aware of the active warning signals but became distracted by an undetermined source within the truck's cab, causing them not to maintain sufficient pressure on the brake pedal. "the truck's slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the lead-up to the collision was very likely due to its driver not applying sufficient pressure to the brake pedal" (12.4 (invalid formatted quote)). Additionally, the driver's peripheral vision was likely restricted, preventing them from detecting the truck's subtle forward movement, which further supports distracted driving as a significant safety theme in this incident. "it is very likely that the truck driver's peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted" (12.5 (invalid formatted quote)).

Inadequate Risk Assessment and Management for Level Crossings
Inadequate risk assessment and management for level crossings is another safety theme, as the accident occurred at a level crossing that had undergone assessment under the LCSIA process, but no formal SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) assessment was conducted for the recommended risk treatments. "in response to mulcocks road's lcsia report, no formal sfairp assessment was undertaken for recommended risk treatments" (22.6 (invalid formatted quote)). This indicates a systemic issue with how risks at level crossings are evaluated and managed, which is characteristic of an organizational or systemic influence on safety.

Lack of Effective Prioritization for Level Crossing Upgrades
The lack of effective prioritization for level crossing upgrades is a safety theme that emerges from the report, as it was found that the selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs and upgrades is not effectively prioritized towards those representing the greatest risk. "selection of level crossings for regular risk review lcsias, and indeed upgrade in many cases, is not being effectively prioritised towards those representing the greatest risk" (22.8 (invalid formatted quote)). This theme is relevant because it highlights a broader issue with how resources and efforts are allocated to mitigate risks at level crossings, which could have implications for future safety.

Insufficient Implementation of Safety Recommendations
Insufficient implementation of safety recommendations is a safety theme related to this accident, as the LCSIA report's recommended risk treatments, such as the closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing or the installation of half-arm barriers, were not acted upon. "neither the council nor kiwirail could provide a documented sfairp assessment for the lcsia report's recommendation to close mulcocks road level crossing" (14.3 (invalid formatted quote)). The failure to implement these recommendations, which could have prevented the accident, points to a systemic issue in the follow-through of safety measures.

Inadequate Guidance for Risk Treatment Assessments
Inadequate guidance for risk treatment assessments is a safety theme because the industry lacks documented processes and minimal guidance on how to undertake SFAIRP assessments for level crossing risk treatments. "sfairp assessments were not being routinely carried out for risk treatments recommended in lcsia reports. no documented process, and minimal guidance, on sfairp assessment for level crossing risk treatments was available in industry documents" (22.7 (invalid formatted quote)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that there is a gap in the knowledge or procedures necessary to properly assess and manage risks at level crossings.

Ambiguity in Risk Assessment Conversion Thresholds
Ambiguity in risk assessment conversion thresholds is a safety theme identified in the report, as there is confusion in the guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values, particularly in the 20.0 - 20.6 range. "the guidance for converting alcam risk scores to lcss values is ambiguous for alcam risk scores in the 20.0 - 20.6 range" (22.9 (invalid formatted quote)). This ambiguity could lead to inconsistencies in risk assessments and potentially impact the prioritization and treatment of level crossing risks.
Themes for 2013_201: 
Fire Detection and Response Systems
Fire detection and response systems are critical on ships due to the high risk of fire spreading quickly in the presence of machinery spaces and cargo holds adjoining accommodation blocks. These systems are designed to be self-sufficient, as ships cannot rely on shore-based fire services while at sea. The importance of these systems is highlighted by the fact that the crew's knowledge of how to respond to fires is paramount, and international conventions require crews to be trained in firefighting and to participate in fire drills at least once each month ("The system for preventing, detecting and extinguishing fires on ships is designed around ships needing to be self-sufficient" (4.1.2)). In the case of the Taokas Wisdom, the crew was able to bring the fire under control through their actions alone, and the shore fire personnel followed up to extinguish the fire fully, indicating that the shipboard systems for detecting and responding to fires played a crucial role in the incident ("In this case the crew were able to bring the fire under control through their actions alone" (4.1.4)).

Fire Containment Practices
Fire containment is a safety theme that involves practices to prevent the spread of fire, such as using fire-resistant construction methods and ensuring that spaces on fire are enclosed to minimize damage. In the incident on the Taokas Wisdom, the fire was initially contained within a single cabin, but the decision to open the cabin door without sufficient firefighting resources ready led to the fire no longer being contained and beginning to spread across the alleyway ("Having first reported to the bridge he went to the scene of the fire. There he ordered that the cabin door be opened so that he could tackle the fire with a portable fire extinguisher" (4.3.9)). This demonstrates the importance of proper containment practices and the potential consequences of not adhering to them.

Command and Control in Emergency Situations
Command and control in emergency situations refer to the establishment of a structured response with clear leadership and coordination among the crew. In the case of the Taokas Wisdom, the lack of an effective command and control system was identified as a factor that likely reduced the effectiveness of the shipboard firefighting response. The master did not report to the bridge to take control, no crew muster was conducted, and no one from the ship alerted the shore authorities to the fire, leading to an ad-hoc assembly of firefighting teams ("In this case the master did not report to the bridge and take control from there. No crew muster was conducted and no-one from the ship alerted the shore authorities to the fire" (4.3.5)). This highlights the need for a well-defined command structure to manage emergency responses effectively.

Training and Familiarity with Emergency Procedures
Training and familiarity with emergency procedures are essential for ensuring that all crew members know their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire. The Taokas Wisdom's firefighting drills were found to be ineffective in achieving this aim, as evidenced by the second officer's unawareness of his team's responsibility for controlling ventilation and the master's uncertainty about which officer was in charge of which fire party ("the second officer had been on board the taokas wisdom for 9 months... however, he was still unaware that his team was responsible for controlling ventilation in the event of a fire" (4.4.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This safety theme is relevant to the accident because it underscores the importance of effective drills and training in preparing the crew for real emergency situations.

Ventilation Control During Fires
Ventilation control during fires is a critical aspect of firefighting on ships, as it involves closing down ventilation systems to starve the fire of oxygen. In the incident, the automatic closing of the recirculation air damper restricted the supply of air to some extent, but the fire in AB-3's cabin was being force-fed air because the supply-air damper on the A-deck did not close automatically, and no fire dampers were closed manually ("however, the second officer was not aware that he was supposed to be in charge of the ventilation team. consequently no fire dampers were closed manually, which meant the fire in ab-3's cabin was being force-fed air" (4.3.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for proper management of airflow to effectively extinguish a fire and prevent its spread.

Investigation and Preservation of Evidence
Investigation and preservation of evidence are crucial for determining the cause of a fire and for learning lessons to prevent future incidents. In the case of the Taokas Wisdom, the Commission was unable to identify a definitive cause for the fire, mainly due to the cleanup efforts of the crew, which disturbed the evidence before investigators could conduct their examinations ("the commission was unable to identify a definitive cause for this fire, mainly due to the cleanup efforts of the crew once the fire was extinguished" (4.1.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This safety theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the importance of preserving the scene of an incident for a thorough investigation to take place.
Themes for 2017_007: 
Use of Automation
The use of automation is a safety theme relevant to this accident because the flight crew elected to use an 'open descent' procedure rather than the fully automated 'managed descent' mode. This decision required a higher level of human intervention to keep the airplane within permissible limits on the arrival route ("The flight crew elected to use an 'open descent' procedure rather than the available, fully automated 'managed descent' mode" (5.2)). The reliance on manual monitoring over automated systems increased operational risk by placing more reliance on human performance ("this increased operational risk by placing more reliance on human performance" (5.3)).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is a critical safety theme in this accident as the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their airplane's location in relation to the standard arrival route, leading to the descent below the published minimum safe altitude ("The aeroplane descended below a published minimum safe altitude for a segment of the arrival procedure, because the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their aeroplane's location in relation to the standard arrival route" (5.1)). The crew's lack of situational awareness was a direct contributor to the altitude breach ("Rather the issue was the flight crew not maintaining full situational awareness" (4.3.23)).

Crew Resource Management
Crew resource management (CRM) is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. CRM involves the effective use of all available resources for flight crew personnel to assure a safe and efficient operation, reducing error, avoiding stress, and increasing efficiency ("crew resource management" (4.3.1)). The flight crew's failure to communicate and cross-check at key points, which are important aspects of CRM, contributed to the loss of situational awareness and non-compliance with altitude restrictions ("Communication and cross-checking at key points are important for pilots maintaining situational awareness" (4.3.16)).

Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures
Adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) is a safety theme because the operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate use of the airplane's automated navigation systems, which increased the reliance on human performance ("The operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate use of the aeroplane's automated navigation systems" (5.3)). The flight crew's deviation from SOPs by not using managed-descent mode and not actively using on-board systems like the navigation display to monitor their compliance with altitude restrictions was a factor in the incident ("The crew could have followed the operator's procedures more actively" (4.3.24)).

Air Traffic Control Procedures
Air traffic control (ATC) procedures are a relevant safety theme as the air traffic controller observed the airplane's descent below the minimum safe altitude but did not follow the required procedures to alert the flight crew until after the airplane had landed ("The air traffic controller observed the aeroplane's descent below the minimum safe altitude, but did not follow the required procedures and alert the flight crew until the aeroplane had landed" (5.4)). The controller's inaction and deviation from standard procedure could have compromised safety and contributed to the normalization of non-standard responses to air traffic situations ("To do otherwise would risk normalising non-standard responses to air traffic situations" (4.3.20)).

Training and Familiarity with Routes
Training and familiarity with routes is a safety theme because the captain's lack of recent experience flying domestically within New Zealand and unfamiliarity with the route between Wellington and Christchurch contributed to the incident ("The captain had not flown domestically within New Zealand for several years, and was therefore less familiar with flying between Wellington and Christchurch than the first officer" (4.2.1)). This lack of familiarity may have affected the crew's ability to manage the descent profile effectively and maintain situational awareness ("In following these rules, the crew could have given more consideration to the captain's unfamiliarity with the route" (4.3.13)).
Themes for 2014_201: 
Ageing and Material Degradation
Ageing and material degradation is a safety theme that refers to the weakening of vessel materials over time due to continuous use and exposure to operational stresses. In the case of the Dream Weaver, the hull's fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) laminate had degraded after approximately 16 years of operation, which is symptomatic of fatigue failure mechanisms ("The general degradation and delamination of the Dream Weaver's hull shell laminate was symptomatic of the fatigue failure mechanism described by Eric Greene Associates" (4.2.2)). The Dream Weaver's hull failure was a direct result of this material degradation, particularly in the high-stress bridge deck area near the bow ("After 16 years of continual operation the Dream Weaver's hull failed in a typically high stress area for catamaran vessels: in the bridge deck structure near the bow" (5.2)).

Design Limitations and Operational Awareness
Design limitations and operational awareness encompass the understanding and adherence to a vessel's operational parameters based on its design characteristics. The Dream Weaver was operated outside of its permitted wave-height/speed limitations, which contributed to the hull rupture at its most vulnerable point ("The Dream Weaver was being driven too hard, outside its permitted wave-height/speed limitations, for the sea conditions at the time, causing the hull to rupture at its most vulnerable point: the weakened areas near the bow" (5.3)). The crew's lack of awareness of these limitations was a significant factor in the accident, as the skipper rarely considered the wave-height/speed restriction table when operating the vessel ("The skipper was vaguely aware of the wave-height/speed restriction table, but rarely considered it when operating the Dream Weaver" (4.2.26)).

Crew Training and Emergency Preparedness
Crew training and emergency preparedness refer to the adequacy of crew training for handling emergency situations and the knowledge of operating emergency systems. In the Dream Weaver incident, the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements, which was crucial in responding to the flooding ("the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements" (5.4)). Additionally, the most recent documented training in the use of the bilge-pumping system had been in 2010, and the deckhand had received no training in the use of the secondary emergency bilge-pumping systems (4.3.2).

Housekeeping and Equipment Maintenance
Housekeeping and equipment maintenance involve the proper upkeep and condition of the vessel's equipment and spaces to ensure safety. Poor housekeeping practices on the Dream Weaver led to blocked bilge suctions, which prevented the bilge pumps from effectively removing water from the flooded hull ("These items were blocking the bilge suctions and were highly likely the reason for the primary pump being unable to keep up with the ingress of water through the ruptured hull" (4.3.5)). The operator's safety management system failed to maintain an adequate standard of housekeeping on board the vessel ("the operator's safety management system for the dream weaver did not ensure that an adequate standard of housekeeping was maintained on board the vessel" (5.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Structural Modifications and Stress Distribution
Structural modifications and stress distribution concern changes made to a vessel's structure that can affect its stress points and overall integrity. The Dream Weaver had undergone modifications such as lengthening the vessel, fitting more powerful engines, and adding a hydrofoil, all of which altered or increased the stress field in the bow structure ("Other factors that would have altered or increased the stress field in the bow structure were the lengthening of the vessel, fitting more powerful engines and fitting the hydrofoil near the bow" (4.2.12)). These modifications likely contributed to the vessel's vulnerability to failure under operational stresses.

Safety Management System Effectiveness
The effectiveness of a safety management system (SMS) is a safety theme that evaluates how well an SMS identifies and mitigates risks. In the case of the Dream Weaver, the SMS did not ensure that critical operating parameters were conspicuously promulgated and enforced, nor did it ensure that the crew were adequately trained for emergency procedures ("the operator's safety management system for the dream weaver did not ensure that wave-height/speed operating restrictions for the vessel were conspicuously promulgated and enforced" (5.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). The omission of safety-critical operating parameters in the SMS was a significant oversight that went undetected by the vessel owner and operator (4.2.28).
Themes for 2015_001: 
Turbine Blade Maintenance and Specifications
The theme of turbine blade maintenance and specifications is highly relevant to this accident as the initial cause of the engine failure was a fractured compressor turbine blade. The fracture originated from a fatigue crack in the blade's trailing edge, which was below the specification for a new blade ("A fractured compressor turbine blade caused the engine failure" (4.1.1)). The overhauled blades, which had been through a strip and recoat repair process, did not have the same measurement specifications as new blades, leading to the possibility of failure before the next inspection interval ("Blades that had been through that repair process, without verification of critical dimensions, might fail before the next 3,000-hour inspection" (4.1.5)). This indicates that the maintenance and specification standards for overhauled blades were a significant factor in the accident.

Training in Emergency Procedures
Training in emergency procedures is a critical safety theme in this accident, as evidenced by the pilot's actions during the emergency. The pilot's decision to bail out through the cockpit window rather than the cabin rear door, and his immediate deployment of his parachute, were contrary to the operator's training and emergency procedures ("The pilot unwittingly jeopardised the evacuation by baling out through his cockpit window rather than from the cabin rear door" (4.1.3)). This suggests that the pilot's training in emergency procedures may have been inadequate, which is supported by the finding that "it was likely that the operator's training of the pilot in emergency procedures was inadequate" (5.8).

Compliance with Airworthiness Instructions
Compliance with airworthiness instructions is a safety theme that emerged from the accident due to the maintenance provider's potential oversight in following the engine manufacturer's recommended inspection procedure. The report suggests that the maintenance provider may not have fully followed the borescope inspection requirements, which could have allowed the detection of the fatigue crack in the compressor turbine blade ("It was likely that the maintenance provider had not followed fully the engine manufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor turbine blades" (5.6)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of adhering to the latest maintenance procedures to ensure the continued airworthiness of aircraft components.

Use of Overhauled vs. New Components
The use of overhauled versus new components is a pertinent safety theme in this accident. The investigation identified that the overhauled compressor turbine blades did not meet the same specifications as new blades, which could lead to premature failure ("The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same as those for new blades" (4.1.5)). This theme is relevant because it underscores the risks associated with using overhauled components that may not meet the stringent specifications required for safe operation.

Pilot Equipment and Survival Gear
Pilot equipment and survival gear is a safety theme related to this accident, as the pilot was not equipped with a lifejacket or flotation device despite the potential for having to ditch the aircraft or bail out over water ("Parachute drop pilots were not required to wear lifejackets or flotation devices if their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land" (4.4)). The report identified this as a safety issue, noting that it downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to make an emergency water landing ("this was a safety issue, because the scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to make a ditching, or bail out and drift to a water landing" (4.4.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for appropriate survival gear to increase the survivability of pilots in emergency situations.

Engine Operating Limits and Handling Procedures
Engine operating limits and handling procedures are a safety theme related to this accident. The report discusses the importance of observing engine speed and temperature limits to protect the engine from damage that could shorten the lifespan of turbine components ("The flight manual has operating limits for engine speed and temperature, which pilots must observe in order to protect the engine" (4.2.9)). While the operator's engine handling policy did not contribute to the engine failure, this theme is still relevant as it emphasizes the need for proper engine management to prevent cumulative damage and ensure the reliability of aircraft engines.
Themes for 2013_106: 
Fatigue Management
Fatigue management is a critical safety theme as it relates to ensuring that individuals who perform safety-critical roles are well-rested and alert. In the context of this accident, the train controller's performance was "highly likely impaired by fatigue" (4.4.15), and the roster did not provide "sufficient opportunity for the train controller to recover from any sleep debt" (5.3). The sleep expert concluded that the train controller's fatigue was likely due to "a cumulative sleep debt due to insufficient opportunities to recover from previous periods of work" (4.4.13). This theme is relevant because fatigue can lead to lapses in attention and judgment, which are crucial in roles such as train control where the consequences of errors can be severe.

Human Error and Assumptions
Human error and the reliance on assumptions are safety themes that highlight the importance of strict adherence to procedures and the dangers of deviating from established protocols. In this accident, the train controller "authorised the work vehicles to cross the rail bridge in the path of the approaching train" without verifying the train's location, acting on an assumption rather than verified information (5.1). This assumption did not comply with KiwiRail's rules and created a significant risk (5.2). The Commission had previously identified the issue of train controllers acting on assumptions and had recommended that KiwiRail ensure that track occupations are authorized based on verified information only (4.2.10). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for rigorous checks and balances to prevent accidents resulting from incorrect assumptions.

Roster and Shift Patterns
Roster and shift patterns are a safety theme that deals with the scheduling of work hours to minimize fatigue and ensure adequate rest periods for employees. The train controller's roster "did not offer the train controller sufficient opportunity to recover from any sleep debt incurred after a shift cycle" (4.3). The sleep expert's analysis indicated that the roster allowed for the potential accumulation of a sleep debt, which was not adequately addressed by the shift patterns (4.4.2, 4.4.4). This theme is relevant to the accident as improper rostering can lead to fatigue among employees, which in turn can impair cognitive performance and increase the risk of accidents.

Training and Performance Monitoring
Training and performance monitoring are safety themes that focus on the continuous development of employee skills and the oversight of their performance, especially in safety-critical roles. Despite the train controller having been involved in previous incidents and identified as having concentration and focus issues, KiwiRail continued to allow him to perform the role without addressing these performance issues adequately (4.7). The Commission recommended increased frequency of safety observations for this train controller due to his performance issues (4.7.2). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for effective training and monitoring to ensure that employees maintain the required standards of performance, particularly when their roles directly impact safety.

Workplace Culture and Practices
Workplace culture and practices are a safety theme that encompasses the attitudes, values, and behaviors within an organization that can influence safety outcomes. In this case, a local practice had evolved where maintenance staff would not request time on track before trains known to them had passed, leading the train controller to make an unsafe assumption (5.2). The Commission's previous recommendations pointed to the need for KiwiRail to address issues related to workplace culture, training, and education regarding stress and fatigue management (4.8.3). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates how informal practices and cultural norms can undermine safety protocols and contribute to accidents.

Stress and Psychological Well-being
Stress and psychological well-being are safety themes that consider the mental health and emotional state of employees, particularly in high-pressure work environments. The train controller had been experiencing increased pressure and stress, which affected his sleep quality and ability to rest (4.3.1). The clinical psychologist noted that chronic sleep disturbance due to shift work could negatively impact cognitive functions such as attention and memory, which are critical for a train controller's performance (4.5.3). This theme is relevant as it shows that an employee's psychological state can have a direct impact on their ability to perform safety-critical tasks effectively, thereby influencing the risk of accidents.
Themes for 2017_101: 
Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
Fatigue and alertness are critical human factors in transportation safety, particularly for operators of vehicles like train drivers. In this incident, the driver likely experienced microsleeps due to fatigue, which led to missing the warning and compulsory stop boards. The driver's susceptibility to microsleeps was attributed to a combination of factors, including suffering from mild obstructive sleep apnea, a poor night's sleep before the shift, and being awake for over 10 hours during a night shift. This is evidenced by the findings that "the driver was likely experiencing microsleeps at the time" (5.2) and "the driver was very likely susceptible to experiencing microsleeps due to a combination of the following factors" (5.3).

Medical Assessment and Health Monitoring
The medical assessment and health monitoring of safety-critical workers are essential to ensure they are fit for duty. In this case, the driver's undetected mild obstructive sleep apnea was a contributing factor to the incident. The safety benefits of KiwiRail's health assessment program were not fully realized, as indicated by the finding that "the safety benefits derived from the KiwiRail safety-critical worker health assessment were not fully realised by those involved, and as a result the driver's sleep apnoea had gone undetected" (5.4). This highlights the importance of effective health monitoring systems that capture accurate data directly from the subjects being assessed.

Fatigue Risk Management Systems
A comprehensive fatigue risk management system is necessary to manage the risks associated with fatigue among safety-critical personnel. KiwiRail's draft fatigue risk management system policy was still under development at the time of the incident. The existing system did not provide sufficient guidance to drivers to evaluate their condition before attending shifts, as noted in the finding that "Had the current system been able to provide additional guidance to drivers, it may have helped them to evaluate their condition better before attending shifts" (5.5). This theme is relevant because it addresses the organizational and operational components required to ensure personnel perform at adequate levels of alertness.

Technical Failures and System Reliability
Technical failures in safety systems can have severe consequences, as seen in this incident where the eProtect system failed to prevent the train from entering the worksite without authorization. The failure was due to an undetected technical error in the processing unit on board the locomotive. The eProtect system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service, which is a significant oversight in system reliability and safety assurance, as stated in the findings: "The system did not work on this occasion because a technical error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected and rectified by KiwiRail staff" (5.6) and "The error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected because the eProtect system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service" (5.7).

Safety Communication and Information Dissemination
Effective communication and dissemination of safety information are crucial for ensuring that all personnel are aware of potential hazards and the necessary precautions. In this incident, the driver had noted the planned worksite at Bridge 107 and highlighted the entry in the daily information bulletin, but still entered the worksite without authorization nearly nine hours later. This suggests a potential issue in how safety information is communicated and retained by personnel over time, as indicated by the analysis that "At the start of the shift the driver collected a copy of the daily information bulletin from the Kawerau depot. The driver noted the planned worksite at Bridge 107 and highlighted the entry because it would affect the route for the train's return journey that day" (4.2.1).

Organizational Safety Culture
The safety culture within an organization influences how safety procedures are followed and how seriously safety protocols are taken by its employees. In this case, there is evidence that the importance of the medical assessment program was not fully appreciated by those involved, which could be indicative of a broader issue with the organization's safety culture. This is supported by the finding that "It is an indication that the importance and safety benefits of the medical assessment programme were not fully realised by those involved" (4.3.15). An organization's commitment to safety culture is fundamental to preventing accidents and ensuring the well-being of its employees and the public.
Themes for 2011_006: 
Weight and Balance Management
Weight and balance management is a critical aspect of flight safety, ensuring that an aircraft is loaded within its permissible limits for safe operation. In the Pauanui incident, the primary reason for the aircraft's failure to take off was that its "centre of gravity was well forward of the maximum permissible limit" (5.1). The pilot and Great Barrier Airlines had not calculated the actual weight and balance of the airplane prior to the flight (5.2), and the airline had not provided the necessary portable scales for the pilot to comply with the airline's procedures for determining the airplane weight and balance (5.3). This theme is relevant to the accident as improper weight and balance management directly impacted the aircraft's take-off performance, contributing to the runway excursion.

Pilot Training and Supervision
Adequate pilot training and supervision are essential to ensure that flight operations are conducted safely and in accordance with established procedures. In this incident, systemic deficiencies within the management of Great Barrier Airlines' operation, including the pilot check and training program, contributed to the accident (5.8). The pilot did not adequately plan for the flight, had a low understanding of scheduled performance, and did not comply with some of Great Barrier Airlines' policies and procedures (4.3.2). These deficiencies indicate that the pilot training and supervision were below the required standard, which is a safety theme relevant to the accident as it highlights the lack of preparedness and oversight that could prevent such incidents.

Regulatory Oversight
Regulatory oversight is intended to ensure that aviation operators adhere to safety standards and correct any deficiencies in a timely manner. In the case of Great Barrier Airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had recurring concerns for the management and standard of operations at the airline during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions taken to address those concerns had been largely ineffective (4.4). The CAA should have taken more decisive action to address the serious safety concerns identified in consecutive audits (5.10). This theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the role of regulatory bodies in enforcing safety standards and the potential consequences when oversight is not sufficiently rigorous or effective.

Aircraft Performance Understanding
Understanding aircraft performance is crucial for pilots to make informed decisions about the feasibility of flight operations under various conditions. In the Pauanui incident, the pilot did not fully understand the variables of airplane performance, as evidenced by her expectation that the take-off performance at Pauanui would be similar to what she was used to at North Shore, despite the different runway conditions (4.2.16). This lack of understanding is a safety theme relevant to the accident because it contributed to the pilot's decision to attempt take-off under conditions where the aircraft was too heavy for the runway and the safety margin required by Civil Aviation Rules (5.4).

Aerodrome Suitability and Performance Assessment
Ensuring the suitability of an aerodrome for the specific aircraft and flight operation is a key safety consideration. In this incident, the aeroplane exceeded the equivalent single wheel load for the Pauanui runway (5.5), and the aerodrome operator did not know the origin of the published maximum equivalent single wheel load values nor had it determined the effects of subsurface irrigation on the runway strength (5.7). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of assessing aerodrome conditions and aircraft compatibility, which in this case, were factors that could have affected the safety of aerodrome operations by reducing the take-off performance of the aircraft using the runway.

Organizational Safety Culture
An organization's safety culture influences the behavior and decision-making of its employees, including adherence to safety procedures and reporting of safety concerns. The Pauanui incident revealed a culture of acceptance of non-conforming practices within Great Barrier Airlines (5.9), and internal audits had failed to identify frequent non-compliance with the airline's standard operating procedures (5.8). This safety theme is relevant to the accident as it reflects the broader organizational environment that allowed safety deficiencies to persist, ultimately contributing to the occurrence of the incident.
Themes for 2017_003: 
Corrosion and Material Failure
Corrosion and material failure is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the locking springs of the landing gear failed due to intergranular corrosion followed by stress corrosion cracking and fatigue, which ultimately led to the springs breaking in overload. The corrosion was likely initiated by salt depositing on the springs and reacting with the stainless steel, exacerbated by the aircraft operating in a 'severe' corrosion environment ("The corrosion was likely initiated by salt depositing on the springs and over time reacting with the stainless steel" (3.7), "The aeroplane was operating in a corrosion environment that was classified as 'severe'" (3.6)).

Maintenance and Inspection Procedures
Maintenance and inspection procedures are a safety theme in this accident as the routine maintenance inspection program for the locking springs was unlikely to detect the corrosion cracking prior to their failure. There was also no required preventive maintenance on the locking springs to limit the extent of corrosion damage. This indicates a potential gap in the maintenance program's ability to prevent such failures ("The maintenance inspection programme for the locking springs would have been unlikely to detect the corrosion cracking in the locking springs prior to their failing" (4.5), "there was no required preventive maintenance on the locking springs to limit the extent of corrosion damage" (4.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Design and Redundancy
Design and redundancy are pertinent safety themes as the landing gear was designed with two locking springs, each capable of holding the gear in the down position. The failure of one spring did not induce additional stress on the remaining spring, which suggests that redundancy was a considered safety feature. However, this incident was the first dual in-service failure, indicating that the redundancy may not have been sufficient in preventing the unsafe condition ("The manufacturer's assessment of a (single) locking spring failure was that it would have 'No Safety Effect'" (3.16), "This occurrence, the 14th, was the first dual in-service failure" (3.10)).

Environmental Operating Conditions
Environmental operating conditions are a safety theme because the aircraft operated in an environment with a high potential for corrosion, which contributed to the failure of the locking springs. The Federal Aviation Administration's Advisory Circular classified the operating environment as 'severe', and the aircraft was subject to a Corrosion Prevention and Control Programme that did not specifically address the landing gear ("The aeroplane was operating in a corrosion environment that was classified as 'severe'" (3.6), "The CPCP was in place for the entire life of the aeroplane, and was designed to limit the extent of corrosion damage to the aeroplane and its components" (3.31)).

Crew Decision-Making and Procedures
Crew decision-making and adherence to procedures are safety themes because the flight crew's actions to recycle the landing gear multiple times before the emergency landing were outside documented procedures and had the potential to exacerbate the condition. This highlights the importance of following established procedures and the potential safety implications when deviations occur ("The recycling of the landing gear several times before the emergency landing was outside documented procedures, and had the potential to exacerbate the condition" (4.8), "Pilots should, therefore, always adhere to a checklist to ensure an appropriate response to a situation" (3.37)).

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency preparedness and response is a safety theme as the crew's decision to divert to Palmerston North Aerodrome was sound, and the preparation for the emergency landing was well conducted in accordance with company procedures. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the crew's emergency response and the importance of having robust emergency procedures in place ("The crew's decision to divert to Palmerston North Aerodrome was sound and the preparation for the emergency landing was well conducted and in accordance with company procedures" (4.7)).
Themes for 2017_104: 
Vulnerability to Vandalism
The vulnerability of the suburban rail network to vandalism is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The report indicates that there is an active subculture that targets suburban rail networks for spray-paint attacks, seeking notoriety within that subculture ("Suburban rail networks throughout the world have long been the target of spray-paint attacks" (4.1.1)). The incident in question involved the deliberate immobilization of a passenger train to facilitate such an attack, highlighting potential safety and security vulnerabilities within the rail passenger operation ("However, the deliberate act of immobilising a passenger train in order to carry out an attack highlighted potential safety and security vulnerabilities within the rail passenger operation" (4.1.2)).

Emergency Door Release Misuse
The misuse of emergency door release (EDR) systems is another safety theme. The attackers used the EDR to immobilize the train, which was not the intended use of the system ("It was virtually certain that activating the emergency door release levers was a deliberate act to immobilise the train" (4.2.1)). The design of the EDR system is such that it should deter unauthorized use while allowing access in emergencies, but in this case, the design did not prevent the planned immobilization by the group ("However, in the circumstances of this incident it is unlikely that any design deterrent would have prevented the group carrying out a planned immobilisation of the train" (4.3.11)).

Crew Response to Unusual Situations
The lack of policies or procedures to guide train crew in responding to unusual situations is a critical safety theme. The report states that Transdev had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train crew in responding to unusual situations, such as the one encountered during the incident ("transdev had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train crew in responding to unusual situations" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). The crew's response was limited by their training and the absence of clear guidelines for such scenarios ("However, it was likely that this course of action was taken simply because the train crew was not trained in alternative options" (4.4.8)).

Communication with Emergency Services
Effective communication with emergency services is a safety theme that emerged from this incident. The train crew did not contact the police directly, which led to delays and potential inaccuracies in the information relayed to first responders ("As neither the driver nor the train manager contacted the Police communications centre directly, the call takers were receiving some of the information from parties who were not at the scene" (4.5.5)). The report suggests that direct communication with emergency services by the train crew could have provided more accurate and timely information ("Had the train crew contacted emergency services directly, it is likely that the necessary information would have been passed on with more accuracy and in a timelier fashion" (4.5.8)).

Emergency Door Release Design Balance
Striking the right balance in the design of emergency door release systems is a safety theme related to this accident. The design must deter unauthorized use while allowing quick access in emergencies. The report acknowledges the challenge in achieving this balance and notes that the design of the Auckland trains' emergency door releases met the intent of industry recommendations, despite the misuse in this incident ("The design of the emergency door releases on the Auckland trains meets the intent of these recommendations" (4.3.10)). The incident highlighted the difficulty in preventing misuse while maintaining accessibility for emergencies ("It is not easy to strike the right design balance between deterring unauthorised use of the emergency door release system and allowing entry and egress in an emergency" (4.3.11)).

Passenger Safety During Vandalism
Ensuring passenger safety during acts of vandalism is a safety theme that arises from this incident. The train crew's primary responsibility was the safety of the passengers, which they maintained by not confronting the vandals and keeping passengers on board the train ("Their prime responsibility was for the safety of the passengers, but they were also faced with a group of people intent on damaging the train, which could have potentially put the passengers at risk" (4.4.1)). The crew's decision to avoid confrontation helped prevent potential physical altercations and ensured passenger safety ("This avoided the potential for physical confrontation" (4.4.7)).
Themes for 2020_104: 
Communication and Non-Technical Skills
Effective communication and non-technical skills are crucial for ensuring safety in rail operations. In this incident, the rail protection officer (RPO) and the train controller had a "different understanding of where the blocking was required" (4.4), leading to a situation where both parties had "different mental models of the area that was being protected and the Protection Work Area limits" (4.4). The use of "poor non-technical skills between the rail protection officer and Train Control resulted in procedural errors being made that went undetected" (4.7). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of clear communication and the correct use of non-technical skills to prevent misunderstandings that could lead to safety incidents.

Familiarity with Operational Area
Familiarity with the operational area is important for the personnel responsible for safety. The RPO in this incident was "unfamiliar with the area of operation" (4.3), which likely contributed to the misunderstanding of the work area limits. The RPO's lack of local knowledge is considered a limitation and "should be considered by rail operators when planning similar operations in the future" (3.36). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for personnel to have a good understanding of the local area to make informed decisions and actions for safety.

Administrative Control Measures
The reliance on administrative control measures alone can be insufficient to ensure safety. The incident demonstrates that "the use of a single administrative control measure to establish a PWA was ineffective and did not provide the track worker with adequate protection" (6.3). The report suggests that "more effective engineering controls should ideally be the preferred option to reduce the frequency of similar accidents occurring in the future" (3.41). This theme is relevant because it points to the need for robust control measures beyond administrative procedures to mitigate the risk of human error and enhance safety.

Pre-Work Planning and Documentation
Proper pre-work planning and documentation are essential for safe operations. In this case, the RPO had "partially completed the Mis 71 form before commencing the blocking procedure with Train Control" (4.5), which contributed to the incident. If the RPO had "completed the Mis 71 form during the process of requesting track occupation with the train controller it is likely that the discrepancy may have been identified" (4.6). This theme is relevant as it emphasizes the importance of completing safety-critical documentation in real-time to capture accurate information and prevent miscommunication.

Engineering Control Measures
Engineering control measures can provide an enhanced level of protection for track workers. The report identifies a safety issue where "the use of an administrative control measure was not effective on its own, and the adoption of engineering control measures when establishing PWAs would provide an enhanced level of protection for track workers" (5.2). The recommendation to incorporate engineering controls (6.4) is based on the understanding that they can minimize risks that human factors play in effective protection for track workers. This theme is relevant as it suggests that integrating engineering solutions can significantly improve safety outcomes.

Training and Competency
Adequate training and competency of personnel are critical for maintaining safety. The report notes that both the train controller and the RPO had undergone training in non-technical skills (3.30), yet human error occurred due to poor communication. The incident underscores the need for continuous improvement in training programs to ensure that personnel are competent in both technical and non-technical aspects of their roles, which is essential for preventing safety incidents.
