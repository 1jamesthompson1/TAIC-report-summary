Themes for 2019_201: 
Mechanical Failure
Mechanical failure is a safety theme that involves the malfunction or breakdown of mechanical systems, which can lead to loss of control or other hazardous situations. In the case of the Discovery 2 accident, the mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control, resulting in the boat making "heavy contact with the canyon wall" (3.3). The specific mechanical failure was due to the stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit breaking, which rendered the steering nozzle and reverse bucket ineffective (3.5). This theme is relevant because the mechanical integrity of the boat's steering system was directly responsible for the accident.

Maintenance Procedures
Maintenance procedures are a safety theme that encompasses the processes and standards used to keep equipment in proper working order. This theme is relevant to the accident because the operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications (4.5). The failure analysis concluded that the stud-bolts had fractured due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient torque being applied to the nuts, indicating inadequate maintenance procedures (3.8). The operator's maintenance checks did not include the use of a torque wrench for the stud-bolts that broke, which was a contributing factor to the accident (3.12).

Hazard Identification and Mitigation
Hazard identification and mitigation is a safety theme that involves recognizing potential risks and implementing measures to prevent accidents or minimize their impact. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's hazard identification system had not identified the risk that a system critical to the safety of the jet boat could fail (3.15-3.21). The operator's maintenance program recognized certain components as critical to safe operation, but the mechanical failure of the steering and control system had not been identified as a hazard, and specific risk mitigation for such an event was absent (3.21). This lack of hazard identification and mitigation contributed to the accident.

Regulatory Compliance
Regulatory compliance is a safety theme that involves adhering to rules and regulations designed to ensure safety. This theme is relevant because the operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82, which stated that "a commercial jet boat operator must have, and apply, a maintenance programme for every jet boat and propulsion unit" (3.10). However, the operator's maintenance programme did not ensure that the manufacturers' specifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system (3.10). The accident highlighted the need for operators to not only comply with regulations but also to exceed minimum standards when necessary to ensure safety (3.39).

Training and Performance
Training and performance is a safety theme that focuses on the skills and actions of personnel, such as operators and maintenance staff, to prevent accidents and respond effectively when they occur. While the actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory to the accident (4.1), the maintenance staff's performance in applying the correct torque to the stud-bolts was inadequate (3.8). The operator's maintenance system did not ensure that maintenance was carried out to manufacturers' specifications, which is indicative of a training or performance shortfall (4.5). Proper training and performance standards are crucial for maintaining safety-critical systems.

Equipment Design and Specifications
Equipment design and specifications are a safety theme that pertains to the technical aspects of equipment that ensure its safe operation. This theme is relevant to the accident because the stud-bolts, washers, and nuts were all part of the HJ212 jet unit model, and the manual for this model contained prescriptive specifications, including the required torque for various nuts and bolts fitted to the jet unit (3.9). The accident occurred due to a deviation from these specifications, highlighting the importance of adhering to equipment design and specifications for safety.
Themes for 2010_101: 
Communication Breakdown
Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as ineffective communication was identified as a common factor across all four incidents. The report highlights multiple instances where poor communication contributed to the sequence of events leading to the accident. For example, the Otahuhu signal box controller did not provide clear information to the Auckland signal box controller about the train running order, leading to confusion and the wrong route being set for the passenger train ("the Otahuhu signal box controller did not give him clear information on which passenger train the shunt was following" (5.2)). Additionally, the use of non-standard phraseology by the No.2 person-in-charge misled the train driver regarding the speed at which to proceed through the worksite ("The non-standard phraseology used by the No.2 person-in-charge of the work gang when calling the passenger train to the worksite area contributed to the driver's assumption that his train was clear to proceed at maximum speed from Panmure Station" (5.9)).

Crew Resource Management
Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a safety theme that involves the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, to enhance safety. The report indicates that better CRM could have prevented the incidents, as there were multiple opportunities for intervention that were missed due to inadequate CRM practices. For instance, after the train was incorrectly routed, the driver made an assumption about the route ahead instead of communicating with the train controller or signal box controller ("Instead he had made an incorrect assumption about the route ahead set for his train without communicating with either the train controller or the signal box controller" (5.10)). Furthermore, the train manager had the opportunity to intervene and discuss the incident with the driver but did not do so ("In this case the train manager was in the same rail car as the driver, so had the opportunity to intervene and discuss the incident with the driver" (5.13)).

Adherence to Operating Procedures
Adherence to operating procedures is a safety theme that emerged from the report, as the established rail operating procedures were not followed, which compromised the safety of rail operations. The report notes that the proper procedure was for signal box controllers to contact train control before taking manual control of signal boxes to obtain important information, but this was not done for the Tamaki signal box ("The proper rail operating procedure was for signal box controllers to contact train control before taking manual control of signal boxes in order to obtain important information such as the correct running order of approaching trains and any worksite activities within the signal box control zones" (5.3)). This lack of adherence to procedures led to the signal box controller being unaware of the protected worksite within the Tamaki signal box control zone.

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is a safety theme that refers to the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within a given time and space that affect safety. In this accident, the driver's situational awareness was compromised, as evidenced by his failure to remember the caution signal displayed on the previous warning signal ("The most likely reason for the driver expecting the next signal, 16AC, to be displaying green was that while stopped at Panmure Station he forgot about the caution signal displayed on the previous warning signal" (5.7)). Additionally, the track worker's lack of situational awareness nearly resulted in a collision with the passenger train ("the track worker was nearly hit by the passenger train because he did not follow the rules for the track occupation method he was using at the time" (5.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Human Factors and Error Management
Human factors and error management is a safety theme that recognizes the role of human error in accidents and the importance of managing these errors to enhance safety. The report discusses the need for a just culture that acknowledges human errors and the importance of error management strategies ("CRM also depends on a change in attitude towards human error; the development of a just culture that recognises that human errors occur all the time and that everybody can make errors at any time" (4.6.7)). The driver's incorrect assumption and failure to use the signal alert system are examples of human errors that contributed to the accident ("The signal alert system that had been installed in the train cab to help the driver to remember if the last signal his train had passed was a caution was not used by the driver on this occasion" (5.8)).

Work Patterns and Mental Demand
Work patterns and mental demand is a safety theme related to the impact of work schedules and task complexity on an individual's performance. The report suggests that the Auckland signal box controller's relief shift duties, which required frequent switching between tasks and locations, may have contributed to a loss of situational awareness and the confusion of train order at Tamaki ("The Auckland signal box controller's relief shift duties required him to switch between signal box desks or move to other locations 5 times within 4 hours, which required him to adjust mentally to the signal box he was working while at times having to anticipate his task at the next signal box" (5.4)). This theme highlights the importance of considering the cognitive demands placed on individuals in safety-critical roles.
Themes for 2011_001: 
Engine Performance Monitoring
Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme that involves the regular assessment and tracking of engine parameters to ensure the engine is functioning correctly. In this accident, the pilot reported "a sudden, large decrease in engine power" (4.1.1) and was unable to recall critical engine parameters such as the N1, which would have indicated the power the engine was developing (4.1.1). The pilot's vague recollection of engine performance and the lack of diagnostic information highlight the importance of effective engine performance monitoring for identifying and addressing potential issues before they lead to an accident.

Pilot Training and Emergency Response
Pilot training and emergency response preparedness are essential for ensuring that pilots can effectively manage unexpected situations. In this case, the pilot "took the appropriate immediate action of putting the helicopter into an autorotative descent" (4.2.2) and managed to execute a well-executed ditching despite the firm landing (4.2.4). However, the pilot's inability to recall other engine indications during the descent (4.2.3) and the lack of helicopter underwater escape training (4.3.6) suggest that additional training could have potentially improved the pilot's response and situational awareness during the emergency.

Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection
Aircraft maintenance and inspection are crucial for identifying and rectifying technical defects that could lead to in-flight emergencies. The investigation found no significant defect in the fuel control unit and power turbine governor (4.2.10), and no pre-existing mechanical defect or foreign object damage in the engine (4.2.11). However, the inability to functionally test these components due to impact damage (4.2.10) and discrepancies in maintenance records (4.2.14) indicate that more rigorous maintenance and inspection protocols might be necessary to ensure the reliability of critical aircraft systems.

Fuel Management
Fuel management encompasses the proper handling, storage, and quality control of aviation fuel to prevent fuel-related engine issues. In this incident, the pilot had topped up the fuel tank from his fuel trailer, and the fuel was later tested and found to be of acceptable quality (4.2.12). The pilot also performed the required water check before the flight (4.2.12), indicating that fuel management was not a contributing factor to the accident. However, the thorough investigation into the fuel quality and management practices underscores its importance as a safety theme.

Emergency Equipment and Procedures
The availability and use of emergency equipment and adherence to emergency procedures are vital for increasing the chances of survival in the event of an accident. The pilot operated over water without a life jacket on board, which was "contrary to Civil Aviation Rules" (5.3), and not wearing a life jacket reduced his chances of survival (5.3). Additionally, the lack of an emergency flotation system and the pilot not wearing a life jacket (4.3.1) highlight the need for proper emergency equipment and procedures, especially when operating over water.

Flight Planning and Communication
Flight planning and communication are key to ensuring that flights are conducted safely and that in the event of an emergency, rescue operations can be initiated promptly. The pilot did not arrange flight-following (4.3.2) and did not make an emergency radio call due to the rapid descent to the sea (4.3.2). The pilot's rescue was fortuitous due to witnesses on shore (5.4), but had he arranged flight-following and made a timely emergency radio call, his rescue might have been more assured (5.4). This emphasizes the importance of flight planning and communication as a safety theme.
Themes for 2012_001: 
Pilot Impairment Due to Substance Use
Pilot impairment due to substance use is a critical safety theme in this accident. The pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre, which was likely the result of recent use and longer-term ingestion of cannabis ("the pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre. This was likely the result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the flight (considered highly likely), and residual THC from his having ingested cannabis over a longer term that redistributed into his blood after he died" (5.9)). The possibility that the pilot's performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded, and the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot ("The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot. The possibility that the pilot's performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded" (5.10)). This theme is relevant because the impairment could have affected the pilot's cognitive functions and decision-making abilities during the flight, contributing to the accident.

Inadequate Regulatory Oversight
Inadequate regulatory oversight is another significant safety theme. The report highlights that the regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the public ("The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public" (5.12)). This theme is relevant because the lack of adequate oversight could lead to systemic issues within the industry, such as insufficient safety standards and practices, which may have contributed to the accident.

Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules is a safety theme that emerged from the pilot's disregard for the rules, as evidenced by his expired medical certificate ("The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules. This was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way, but it did show a disregard for complying with the rules" (5.8)). This theme is relevant because it indicates a pattern of non-compliance that could lead to unsafe practices and increased risk of accidents.

Lack of Private Balloon Licensing Requirements
The lack of private balloon licensing requirements is a safety theme identified in the report. It is considered a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge, or medical certificate can take non-paying passengers for a balloon flight ("It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge or medical certificate can take non-paying passengers for a balloon flight" (5.13)). This theme is relevant because it points to a gap in regulations that could allow unqualified individuals to operate balloons, potentially leading to accidents.

Decision-making and Judgement Errors
Decision-making and judgement errors by the pilot are a central safety theme in this accident. The pilot's poor judgement in attempting to out-climb the power lines and his subsequent actions after the balloon collided with them were identified as contributing factors to the accident ("A last-minute change in wind direction carried the balloon towards power lines that the loaded balloon was probably not capable of out-climbing. In any event, the pilot exercised poor judgement by attempting to out-climb the power lines, and the balloon collided with them" (5.4)). This theme is relevant because it directly relates to the pilot's actions that led to the collision with the power lines and the subsequent tragic outcome.

Emergency Procedures and Equipment Familiarity
Emergency procedures and equipment familiarity is a safety theme that arises from the passengers' lack of knowledge about the emergency equipment and procedures. The report suggests that the passengers were not briefed on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines, which could have been crucial in an emergency situation ("a balloon pilot would not normally brief passengers on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines" (4.5.7)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of ensuring that passengers are aware of and can access emergency equipment and procedures, which could potentially mitigate the severity of an accident.
Themes for 2019_001: 
Aerodynamic Stability of External Loads
Aerodynamic stability of external loads is a critical safety theme in helicopter operations involving underslung loads, such as monsoon buckets. In this accident, the aerodynamic instability of the monsoon bucket was a key factor. The bucket became aerodynamically unstable after the hook-and-loop fastener system came undone, which allowed the stainless-steel ring to become dislodged, changing the shape of the bucket and causing it to fly higher and closer to the helicopter, ultimately contacting the tail rotor ("the displaced tubular, segmented, stainless-steel ring very likely allowed the shape of the bucket to change in the airflow, resulting in the bucket suddenly moving into close proximity to the helicopter" (4.4)). This theme is relevant because the instability of the bucket in flight increased the risk of it coming into contact with the helicopter, which is what occurred in this accident.

Equipment Design and Modification
Equipment design and subsequent modifications are a safety theme that relates to the potential for equipment to fail or become unsafe during operations. In this accident, the initial design of the Cloudburst monsoon bucket's hook-and-loop fastener system had the potential to come undone during operations, which was a contributing factor to the accident ("the monsoon bucket had a hook-and-loop fastener system that had the potential to come undone during operations" (4.5)). Although the manufacturer developed design improvements to reduce this likelihood, these modifications were not mandatory, which is relevant to the accident as the failure of the fastener system led to the aerodynamic instability of the bucket.

Dissemination of Operational Information and Limitations
The dissemination of operational information and limitations is a safety theme that involves the communication of critical operational data and constraints to operators. In this case, the manufacturer had developed operational information and limitations for the use of its monsoon buckets but did not proactively promulgate this information to operators ("The bucket manufacturer had developed operational information and limitations for the use of its monsoon buckets, but did not proactively promulgate this information to operators" (4.6)). This theme is relevant because the lack of communicated information could have contributed to the operator's unawareness of the potential risks and the necessary precautions to mitigate them.

Appropriate Lifting Line Length
The appropriate lifting line length for external load operations is a safety theme that affects the risk of the load coming into contact with the helicopter. In this accident, the lifting line length was such that it likely increased the risk of the external load contacting the tail rotor ("the monsoon bucket lifting line was of a length that likely increased the risk of the external load coming into contact with the tail rotor" (4.7)). This is relevant because a longer lifting line could have reduced the likelihood of the bucket coming into close proximity to the tail rotor, potentially preventing the accident.

Reporting and Learning from Previous Occurrences
Reporting and learning from previous occurrences is a safety theme that involves capturing and sharing information about incidents to improve safety. The operator had not reported an earlier incident with the same bucket through their internal quality and safety management system, which resulted in a missed opportunity to promote awareness or improve operational procedures ("The operator had not reported their earlier incident with this same bucket (see 3.14) through their internal quality and safety management system" (3.46)). This theme is relevant to the accident because the earlier occurrence could have provided valuable insights into the risks associated with the bucket's design and operation, potentially preventing the accident.

Regulatory Framework and Guidance
The regulatory framework and guidance for external load operations is a safety theme that encompasses the rules and recommendations provided by authorities to ensure safe operations. In this accident, there was insufficient guidance available to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations ("There was insufficient guidance available to pilots on the appropriate line length for monsoon bucket operations" (4.8)). This theme is relevant because clear and specific regulatory guidance could have informed the operator's procedures and potentially prevented the bucket from coming into contact with the tail rotor.
Themes for 2017_201: 
Voyage Planning and Navigation Conduct
Voyage planning and navigation conduct is a critical safety theme as it involves the preparation and execution of a ship's route to ensure safe passage. In the case of L’Austral, the voyage planning for the time in the Snares Islands and the standard of bridge resource management did not meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards or the guidelines published in leading industry publications ("Voyage planning and conduct of navigation", 4.3). This inadequacy in planning and execution led to the vessel inadvertently entering a 300-metre exclusion zone and making contact with an uncharted rock ("Findings", 5.1, 5.2). The lack of an agreed plan and effective communication on the bridge further contributed to the accident ("Bridge resource management", 4.3.3-4.3.4).


Bridge Resource Management
Bridge resource management encompasses the effective use of all available resources, including personnel, to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel. In this incident, the standard of bridge resource management on board L’Austral did not meet good industry practice, as evidenced by the lack of effective communication and an agreed plan between the master and the navigation officer ("Bridge resource management", 4.3.4). Additionally, there was an indication that bridge team members were reluctant to intervene with the actions of the master, which is contrary to the principles of good bridge resource management and leaves the ship vulnerable to one-person errors resulting in accidents ("Bridge resource management", 4.3.7-4.3.8).


Use of Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS)
The use of ECDIS is a safety theme that involves the proper utilization of electronic navigation systems to enhance maritime safety. In the case of L’Austral, the operation of the ECDIS did not meet good practice as defined in the IMO guidance or the standards set out in the operator’s safety management system ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)", 4.4). The crew were not fully familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the equipment and were not making the best use of it, which contributed to the vessel entering an unauthorised zone and an area the master had intended to avoid ("Findings", 5.7, 5.8).


Hydrographic Information and Chart Accuracy
Hydrographic information and chart accuracy are essential for safe navigation, especially in uncharted or poorly surveyed areas. The rock with which L’Austral made contact was uncharted and not detected during a hydrographic survey of the islands in 1999 ("Introduction", 4.1.2). The ECDIS on board L’Austral was loaded with an unofficial ENC, which had a lower Category Zone of Confidence (CATZOC) value, indicating a lower level of confidence in the accuracy of the underlying data ("Chart accuracy", 4.4.4-4.4.5). This discrepancy in chart accuracy and the use of unofficial charts contributed to the vessel's grounding.


Regulatory Compliance and Risk Assessment
Regulatory compliance and risk assessment are key safety themes that involve adhering to maritime regulations and conducting thorough risk evaluations to prevent accidents. The Department of Conservation granted a coastal permit allowing L’Austral to navigate up to 300 metres from the shoreline in all of the sub-Antarctic islands, without conducting a formal risk assessment using the appropriate maritime expertise to ensure that the necessary risk controls were in place ("Department of Conservation permits", 4.5.4, "Findings", 5.9). This lack of formal risk assessment and maritime expertise in the permitting process was a contributing factor to the vessel's accident.


Crew Training and Familiarity with Navigation Equipment
Crew training and familiarity with navigation equipment are crucial for the safe operation of a vessel. The navigation officer of L’Austral had completed type-specific training for the ECDIS, but there was a strong case for the ship operator to arrange refresher training to ensure full familiarity with the ECDIS after the officer had spent 20 months ashore ("Electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS)", 4.4.9). The lack of refresher training and the potential inadequacy of the in-house training provided may have affected the navigation officer's ability to effectively use the ECDIS and contribute to the safe navigation of the vessel.
Themes for 2013_002: 
Maintenance Procedures and Oversight
Maintenance procedures and oversight are critical for ensuring the airworthiness of aircraft components. In this accident, the omission of an oil slinger during the reassembly of the right magneto was a direct cause of the engine power loss. The report states, "it is highly likely that the omission of the oil slinger when reassembling the right magneto contributed to the engine loss of power" (4.2.9). Additionally, the report highlights that the imported second-hand engine and its accessories "had not been subjected to the inspections and maintenance required for continued airworthiness before they were released to service" (5.2). This theme is relevant because proper maintenance procedures could have prevented the accumulation of oil in the magneto, which was the most likely cause of the engine power loss.

Inspection of Used Aircraft Parts
The inspection of used aircraft parts is a safety theme that ensures parts are airworthy and suitable for use. The report indicates that the engine's history and the lack of appropriate accompanying documentation meant it should have been subjected to more rigorous inspections (4.3.9). The failure to perform mandatory service bulletins and the lack of adherence to CAA guidance for inspecting used parts of unknown origin (4.3.15) are also highlighted. This theme is relevant to the accident because the engine, sourced from overseas, was not properly inspected or documented, which could have contributed to the oversight in maintenance that led to the engine power loss.

Regulatory Guidelines and Compliance
Regulatory guidelines and compliance are essential for maintaining safety standards in aviation. The report points out that the regulator's guidelines for inspecting used parts of unknown origin were not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were not adequate (5.3). Furthermore, the report notes that the standards of maintenance and inspection for the import and eventual release to service of the helicopter engine did not meet the standards of aviation maintenance best practice (4.3.9). This theme is relevant because the lack of clear guidelines and non-compliance with existing regulations contributed to the improper inspection and maintenance of the engine, leading to the accident.

Engine and Accessory Serviceability
Engine and accessory serviceability is a theme that focuses on the proper functioning of all engine components and accessories. The report discusses the cracked distributor blocks in both magnetos and the substantial amount of engine lubricating oil found inside the breaker compartment of the right magneto (4.2.3, 4.2.5). These issues directly affected the timing and strength of the ignition spark, leading to a decrease in engine performance and ultimately the loss of engine power (4.2.7). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of ensuring that all engine components are in good condition and function correctly to prevent power loss incidents.

Training and Expertise in Maintenance
Training and expertise in maintenance are crucial for the proper handling and servicing of aircraft components. The report reveals that the CAA had not released training material specifically for engineers who carried out conformity inspections, and it was left up to Part 145 companies to train their staff in the procedures involved (4.3.14). The lack of specific training may have contributed to the oversight during the maintenance procedure that led to the engine power loss. This theme is relevant because adequate training and expertise are necessary to ensure that maintenance personnel can correctly identify and rectify potential issues during inspections and servicing.

Life Jacket Usage and Safety Equipment
Life jacket usage and safety equipment are important themes in aviation safety, particularly for flights over water. The report discusses the benefits of aircraft occupants wearing life jackets on flights over water, although it was not a factor in this incident (4.1.3). It also recommends that the risk to people involved in helicopter operations over water will be reduced if quick-donning life jackets are worn at all times where there is the potential for the helicopter to ditch with short notice (4.4.4, 5.4). This theme is relevant as it addresses the preparedness for emergency situations, such as ditching, and the importance of having and using appropriate safety equipment to reduce the risk of injury or fatality.
Themes for 2011_202: 
Bridge Resource Management (BRM)
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that refers to the effective use of all available resources, including people, procedures, and equipment, to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel. It is relevant to this accident because the report indicates that the Monte Stello's deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance, which is a key aspect of BRM ("the monte stello collided with the rock because it deviated from the planned passage. there was, however, evidence that the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Furthermore, the report states that the error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team ("The error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team" (5.4)).

Shared Mental Model
A shared mental model is a safety theme that involves the members of a team sharing the same understanding of the operation to be performed and the teamwork involved. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report highlights that the lack of a shared mental model among the bridge team members contributed to the accident. The report notes that if a team member deviates from what is expected, then other team members will notice, challenge, and correct the error, which did not happen in this case ("An underlying principle of eradicating error within teams is the concept of a shared mental model" (4.2.7)). The master did not discuss the plan with other bridge team members, assuming familiarity with the routine maneuver, which led to a lack of shared understanding and contributed to the accident ("He did not discuss the plan with the other bridge team members, as he thought that entering Tory Channel was a routine manoeuvre which he expected the other bridge team members would be familiar with" (4.3.3)).

Closed Loop Communication
Closed loop communication is a safety theme that ensures clear and confirmed communication within the bridge team. It is relevant to this accident because the report identifies that closed loop communication was not consistently used, which allowed for a critical error to go uncorrected. The report provides an example of how closed loop communication should work and notes that it was not used for one helm order, which led to the rudder being put the wrong way ("Closed loop communication was not used and hence the opportunity to correct the error was lost" (4.3.7)). The lack of closed loop communication was a contributing factor to the vessel's deviation from the planned passage and subsequent collision with the rock.

Red Zone Vigilance
Red Zone vigilance is a safety theme that involves heightened awareness and safety procedures during high-risk operations. This theme is relevant to the accident because the entrance to Tory Channel was recognized as a high-risk "Red Zone" area, yet the declaration of a Red Zone did not lead to the expected heightened level of vigilance from the crew ("The declaration of a Red Zone was intended to trigger a heightened level of crew vigilance and safety for operations" (4.2.11)). The report indicates that the Red Zone declaration had little effect on the actions of the bridge team other than increased manning level, which suggests that the intended safety benefits of the Red Zone were not realized during the accident voyage ("However, it appears to have had little effect on the actions of the bridge team other than the increased manning level" (4.3.12)).

Pilot/Co-Pilot System
The pilot/co-pilot system is a safety theme that involves clear roles and responsibilities for the bridge team, particularly during navigation and maneuvering. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report indicates that the pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes ("The pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was ordered to a location where he was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes" (4.3.13)). The master's failure to ensure that the co-pilot could monitor his actions contributed to the error in rudder direction not being detected and corrected in time to prevent the grounding.

Safety Management System Auditing and Training
Safety management system auditing and training is a safety theme that involves the regular review and improvement of safety practices, as well as ensuring that all crew members are adequately trained. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report discusses the importance of ongoing training and auditing to maintain effective BRM practices. It notes that not all bridge team members had received formal BRM training and that the master and third mate had not wholly embraced the concept, which affected the implementation of the safety management system ("Of the four bridge team members on board the Monte Stello, only the master and third mate had received formal BRM training" (4.4.2)). The report also highlights that the Monte Stello had not been fully integrated into KiwiRail's safety management system and that the crew's ad hoc makeup posed a risk ("Arguably the standard of navigation and BRM on the Monte Stello posed the biggest risk to KiwiRail" (4.4.9)).
Themes for 2012_101: 
Load Securing and Compliance with Freight Handling Code
Load securing is a critical safety theme in this accident, as the load was not secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code, leading to it shifting outside the standard loading gauge and causing damage. The report states that "The load shifted outside the standard loading gauge, and struck several track-side structures and another train, because it had not been secured in accordance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code" (5.1). Furthermore, "Only half the required number of webbing strops had been used to secure the load and none had edge protectors fitted to prevent them fraying" (5.2), which indicates a failure to adhere to the specific requirements of the Code for load securing.

Training and Familiarity with Safety Protocols
Training and familiarity with safety protocols is another significant safety theme, as the staff involved with loading, shifting, and securing the wagon body were not sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code. This lack of knowledge contributed to the non-compliance with the Code. The report highlights that "None of KiwiRail's staff involved with loading and securing the load was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code" (5.4). This indicates a systemic issue with training and knowledge dissemination within the organization.

Availability of Appropriate Load-Securing Equipment
The availability of appropriate load-securing equipment is a safety theme that directly impacted the accident. The MDD class special-movement wagon used to transport the load lacked the necessary equipment to secure the load in compliance with the Freight Handling Code. The report finds that "the mdd class special-movement wagon allocated to transport the load from dunedin to christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of equipment made it impossible for staff to secure the load properly, even if they had been aware of the correct procedures.

Adequacy of Safety Management Systems
The adequacy of safety management systems is a theme that underlies the accident, as the Freight Handling Code is a part of KiwiRail's safety management system, yet it was not effectively implemented or followed. The report mentions that "The Freight Handling Code was an integral component of KiwiRail's safety management system" (4.3.1), but the failure to train staff and the absence of necessary equipment suggest that the safety management system was not adequately supporting safe operations.

Pre-Departure Inspections and Load Assessment
Pre-departure inspections and load assessment are crucial safety themes, as the failure to identify non-compliant loads during these inspections contributed to the accident. The report indicates that "The pre-departure train inspection was the final opportunity to identify 'out-of-Code' loads" (4.3.9), yet the rail operators at Dunedin and Timaru did not identify the securing issues. This suggests a need for more thorough inspections and better training on special load assessments.

Organizational Response to Previous Incidents
Organizational response to previous incidents is a safety theme, as prior occurrences had already highlighted the need for better training and application of the Freight Handling Code. The report references an internal investigation from 2008, which "identified the training in, knowledge of and application of the Freight Handling Code as contributory factors" (4.3.11) in separate incidents. This indicates that the organization may not have adequately addressed known safety issues, allowing similar contributing factors to persist until the time of this accident.
Themes for 2015_201: 
Training and Familiarization
The theme of training and familiarization is highly relevant to this accident as the master of the Kea was not properly trained in and familiar with the vessel's new propulsion control system. The Fullers training and familiarization system failed to ensure that the master was adequately prepared to operate the new system, which contributed to the collision. The master had limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various backup functions that could have been used to regain control of the Kea ("the Fullers training and familiarisation system failed to ensure that the master was properly trained in and familiar with the Kea's propulsion control system" (4.1.5), "The master had not received adequate training on the Kea's new control system. He had a limited understanding of the system's functionality and the various back-up functions he could have used to regain control of the Kea" (5.3)).

Control System Reliability
Control system reliability is a central safety theme in this accident. The Kea was allowed to enter and continue service using a follow-up mode of operation despite known faults with that mode, which had already resulted in incidents. The Fullers system did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service, leading to the accident ("the Fullers system allowed the Kea to enter and continue service using the follow-up mode of operation, despite the company knowing that there were faults with that mode that were resulting in incidents" (4.1.5), "The Kea should not have re-entered service with the follow-up mode of control active once it had been established that the system was faulty and unreliable" (5.4)).

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management is a significant safety theme as Fullers did not perform a proper risk assessment to establish the risks associated with the control system's reliability issues, nor did they put in place measures to mitigate those risks. This oversight allowed the Kea to re-enter service with a faulty control system, which was a direct contributor to the accident ("No risk assessment was undertaken to establish what the risks were, and what could be put in place to mitigate the risks" (4.4.1), "Fullers did not adequately manage the risks associated with the replacement of the Kea's propulsion control system and the vessel's re-entry to service" (5.5)).

Surveyor Oversight
Surveyor oversight is another safety theme identified in this accident. Neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the Kea's propulsion control system. The lack of scrutiny by a surveyor during the replacement and commissioning of the critical control system could have provided an additional level of assurance regarding system reliability ("neither the operator nor the surveyor ensured an appropriate level of surveyor oversight of the project to replace the kea's propulsion control system" (4.5 (invalid formatted quote)), "The Kea's propulsion control system was a critical system, the failure of which could have had serious consequences. The replacement of the whole control system should have been afforded a greater level of scrutiny by a surveyor" (5.6)).

Audible and Visual Alarms
The functionality and user interaction with audible and visual alarms is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The master relied on the audible alarm to confirm that a transfer of control had occurred, but was not aware that it would sound three times and stop, irrespective of whether the controls were accepted at the receiving control station. This led to a false belief that the transfer was successful, contributing to the loss of control over the starboard propulsion system ("He relied on the audible alarm to confirm that a transfer had occurred, but was not aware that it would sound three times (about 10 seconds) and stop, irrespective of whether or not the controls were accepted at the receiving control station" (4.3.6), "It is likely that the master believed he had control of the starboard propulsion by the unfortunate timing of the aural alarms" (5.2)).

Passenger Safety Measures
Passenger safety measures, specifically regarding the securing of passenger seating, is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The unsecured seats on the Kea contributed to the number and severity of injuries when the vessel collided with the wharf. Although not required by the maritime rules for the type of voyages the Kea was engaged in, securing the seats would have been a reasonable precaution to protect the safety of passengers ("Many passengers were thrown out of their seats and injured. A number of injuries were caused by unsecured seats landing on top of the passengers" (4.6.1), "Securing the seats to the deck would have been a well-considered precaution that would likely have reduced the number and severity of injuries to passengers" (5.7)).
Themes for 2014_002: 
Fuel Management
Fuel management is a critical aspect of aircraft operation, ensuring that engines receive a continuous supply of fuel. In this incident, the engines lost power due to fuel starvation, which occurred because "the pilot did not switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines" (5.1). The pilot's omission was likely due to his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter, as he had "almost exclusively flown the AS350 helicopter type leading up to the incident flight" (4.2.3). The AS350 has a simpler fuel system, which may have led to the pilot inadvertently applying the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350 to the BK117 (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because proper fuel management would have prevented the engines from running dry and the subsequent loss of power.

Pilot Training and Competency
Pilot training and competency are essential for safe aircraft operation. The pilot involved in the incident had not been assessed for his type-specific knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 in the previous five years (5.2). The pilot's lack of recent experience on the aircraft type was a contributing factor to the incident, as he did not use the starting-engine checklist, which would have prompted him to switch on the fuel transfer pumps (4.2.7). The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that the pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117 (5.3). This theme is relevant because adequate training and competency checks could have ensured the pilot was familiar with the BK117's fuel system and procedures, potentially preventing the incident.

Use of Checklists
The use of checklists is a standard safety practice in aviation to ensure that all necessary procedures are followed. In this case, the pilot did not refer to a written checklist, which would have prompted him to switch the fuel transfer pumps on and turn the dimmer switch off (5.6). The operator did not require pilots to refer to written checklists if they lacked recent experience on an aircraft type (5.6). This theme is relevant because adherence to the checklist could have captured the pilot's omission and prevented the helicopter from taking off with the fuel transfer pumps switched off (4.2.7).

Cockpit Lighting and Warning Systems
Cockpit lighting and warning systems are designed to alert pilots to potential issues that require immediate attention. In this incident, a cockpit lighting modification adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight when the dimmer switch was on (5.4). The helicopter was not designed to generate an aural warning of a critically low fuel level in the supply tanks, which could have alerted the pilot to the potential loss of engine power (5.5). This theme is relevant because if the caution lights had been visible or an aural warning had been present, it could have alerted the pilot to the incorrectly configured fuel system and the low fuel levels in the supply tanks, potentially preventing the incident.

Aircraft Design and Systems
The design of an aircraft's systems can significantly impact its safety. In this incident, the design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if the fuel system was mismanaged and the low-fuel-level warnings were not seen (4.1.2). Later helicopter designs incorporated fuel supply tanks of different capacities, allowing more time for a pilot to recognize and correct issues before both engines lost power (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the aircraft's fuel system design contributed to the rapid loss of power in both engines, leaving the pilot with little time to react.

Organizational Factors and Oversight
Organizational factors and oversight play a crucial role in maintaining safety standards. In this case, the operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough (5.3). The shared delegation of training and competency responsibilities between three managers made it harder for the operator to ensure that all training and competency requirements were being met (4.6.4). This theme is relevant because a clear delineation of duties and effective oversight could have ensured that the pilot was adequately trained, current, and competent, which might have prevented the incident.
Themes for 2014_101: 
Sighting Distances at Level Crossings
Sighting distance is a critical factor for ensuring that drivers have enough time to see an approaching train and react accordingly. In this accident, the sighting distances at the Te Onetea Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards set out by the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual. The report states that "the sighting distances for road users of the te onetea road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards" (4.3.8) and that "it was possible that fully compliant, long, heavy road vehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would have had insufficient time to clear the level crossing from a standing start" (5.7). This indicates that the truck driver may not have had adequate time to react to the approaching train, contributing to the accident.

Road Profile and Vehicle Ground Clearance
The compatibility of the road profile with the ground clearance of road-legal vehicles is essential to prevent vehicles from becoming stuck on level crossings. In this case, the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing had a profile that prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, from passing over without becoming stuck. The report highlights that "the profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck" (5.8). This issue directly contributed to the accident as the truck became immobilized on the tracks.

Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
Adherence to traffic control devices, such as stop signs at level crossings, is crucial for preventing collisions. The report indicates that the truck driver did not stop at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, where the truck became stuck. "The driver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing" (5.4). This non-compliance with traffic control devices removed the opportunity for the truck driver to observe the train and react, leading to the collision.

Audibility of Train Whistles
The ability of a road vehicle driver to hear an approaching train's whistle can be a vital warning to prevent collisions. However, in this incident, the truck's windows were closed, and with the engine running, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle. "The accident reconstruction showed that with the truck engine running and the windows closed, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle" (4.2.9). This factor may have prevented the truck driver from becoming aware of the approaching train in time to take evasive action.

Active Protection at Level Crossings
The presence of active protection measures at level crossings, such as flashing lights and barriers, can significantly reduce the risk of collisions. However, the report notes that even with active protection, collisions can still occur. "Statistics show that the installation of active protection at public road level crossings does not eliminate train/motor vehicle collisions at level crossings" (4.1.3). While this crossing only had passive signs, the theme is relevant as it highlights the need for effective protection measures and possibly suggests that this crossing could have benefited from more active safety measures.

Vehicle Inspection and Mechanical Integrity
Ensuring that vehicles involved in collisions are mechanically sound is important for ruling out vehicle defects as contributing factors. In this accident, the truck was examined, and no faults were found that could have contributed to the accident. "The road vehicle was examined by a qualified inspector at a secure facility the following day. No faults were found on either the semi-trailer or the driving unit" (4.1.6). Although mechanical failure could not be entirely excluded due to the collision damage, the mechanical integrity of the truck was not identified as a contributing factor, focusing attention on other safety themes.
Themes for 2013_101: 
Incomplete Coupling Connection
The incomplete coupling connection is a safety theme that played a critical role in this accident. The report states that "the separation between the sixth and seventh wagons was very likely caused by an incomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected during the terminal brake test undertaken at mission bush before the train departed" (4.1.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This undetected incomplete coupling allowed the hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train descended the gradient from Glenbrook, leading to the train parting and the subsequent derailment (4.4, 5.4).

Non-Technical Skills (Crew Resource Management)
Non-technical skills, also known as crew resource management, are essential for ensuring safety in railway operations. The report highlights that "non-technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource management) were not being used to good effect" (5.6). Specifically, the failure to perform a fundamental brake test procedure after coupling a third locomotive at Glenbrook, which would have ensured that the train's air brakes were functioning correctly, is an example of a lapse in non-technical skills (4.5). The lack of effective communication and challenge and confirm actions among the staff members contributed to the chain of events leading to the derailment (4.5.5, 4.5.9).

Brake System Configuration and Testing
The brake system configuration and testing is a safety theme that was directly related to the accident. The report finds that "the train departed Glenbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating" because "the driver had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly when changing from one driving cab to the other" (5.1). Additionally, the required pre-departure train brake test, which would have revealed that the train brake was not operational, was not performed when a third locomotive was attached to the train (5.3). This oversight allowed the train to depart with a non-operational train brake, contributing to the inability to control the train's speed and the eventual derailment (4.5.9).

Electrical Plug Connection
The incomplete electrical plug connection is a safety theme that initiated the chain of events leading to the derailment. The report indicates that "the incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff" and resulted in the two locomotives only intermittently operating together (4.3). This poor locomotive performance led to the train being unnecessarily declared as disabled at Glenbrook, which was the first event in the chain leading to the derailment (4.3.1).

Fatigue and Circadian Rhythm
Fatigue and circadian rhythm are safety themes that can affect the performance of rail staff. The report discusses the possibility of fatigue as a contributory factor, noting that "it is likely that the time of day, when cognitive performance is at its lowest due to natural circadian rhythm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the performance of those involved in setting up and checking the train" (5.7). Although there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor, the procedural lapses occurred during the period when circadian rhythm is at its lowest, which may have affected cognitive performance (4.6.6, 4.6.7).

Procedural Lapses and Compliance with Operating Practices
Procedural lapses and compliance with operating practices are safety themes that encompass the actions of the train drivers and train examiner. The report identifies several procedural lapses, such as the incorrect fitting of the electrical connection by servicing staff, the incomplete coupling not detected during the terminal brake test, and the incorrect configuration of brake handles in the rear cab of the lead locomotive (4.2.4). These lapses indicate non-compliance with train operating practices and contributed to the derailment (4.6, 5.2).
Themes for 2017_002: 
Low Rotor RPM Event
The theme of a low rotor RPM event is relevant to this accident as it is a critical factor that affects the helicopter's ability to maintain lift and control. The report indicates that "a low-rotor-speed event likely occurred" (4.1) and that the damage observed on the main rotor blades was consistent with the main rotor having 'coned' (3.6), which is a result of insufficient power to maintain the rotor blades' rotational speed under load. The illumination of the Low Rotor RPM caution light further supports this theme (3.6). The pilot's response to a low rotor RPM condition, as recommended by the FAA, would have been to apply additional throttle or lower the collective (3.7), but the engine power setting was low just before impact, indicating that the pilot was likely responding to a low rotor-RPM event at this time (3.8).

Engine Performance and Maintenance
Engine performance and maintenance is a significant safety theme in this accident. The engine's condition could have prevented it from producing maximum specified power, which is crucial for maintaining flight, especially during take-off with a heavy load (4.3). The report details that the engine had various issues, such as not sealing properly, excessive wear, and incorrect spark plug types (3.19). These findings suggest that the helicopter had not been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and the Civil Aviation Rules (4.6). The engine's poor condition likely affected the reliability and maximum power available, which could have contributed to the accident (3.20).

Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions at the time of the accident are a relevant safety theme because they can significantly impact the pilot's ability to control the aircraft. The report mentions that the wind was light and variable but generally a tailwind from the southeast (3.11), and there were short periods of wind gusts that could have reduced the helicopter's rate of climb during a critical phase of flight (3.11). Additionally, the sun was low on the horizon directly ahead of the flight track, which could have affected the pilot's vision and ability to determine the helicopter's height above the tree canopy (3.12). These environmental factors had the potential to affect the safe conduct of the flight (4.2).

Flight Path and Obstacle Clearance
The chosen flight path and obstacle clearance are critical safety themes, as they determine the risk exposure during flight. The report indicates that the helicopter lifted off and flew over densely forested terrain when alternative flight paths were available that offered less risk in the event of an aircraft emergency (4.4). The pilot's inability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tree canopy could have been a factor in the accident (4.5). The investigation could not conclusively determine why the helicopter struck the tree canopy, but it was likely due to either engine power issues or the pilot not maintaining suitable clearance (4.5).

Regulatory Compliance and Pilot Conduct
Regulatory compliance and pilot conduct are safety themes that address the adherence to aviation rules and the responsibilities of the pilot. The report found that the pilot conducted a commercial flight without holding a commercial pilot license or operating under an air operator certificate, which was beyond the privileges of the pilot's private pilot license (4.7). Additionally, the helicopter had not been maintained in accordance with the Civil Aviation Rules, and there were multiple examples of the pilot/owner operating outside the privileges extended to a private pilot or aircraft owner (3.36). This non-compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules is a safety issue that could adversely affect the safety of future operations (3.44).

CAA Oversight and Safety Assurance
The Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) oversight and safety assurance mechanisms are a safety theme that pertains to the effectiveness of regulatory controls in ensuring aviation safety. The report discusses the CAA's allocation of fewer regulatory resources to the non-commercial sector, relying on participants being responsible for safety and complying with regulatory requirements (3.38). However, when participants do not take self-responsibility for compliance, regulatory and surveillance activities are the only controls in place to provide safety assurance (3.41). The investigation found that the pilot/owner had allowed the helicopter's review of airworthiness to expire before the accident, and the CAA did not detect non-compliance in this instance (3.42). This theme highlights the importance of effective oversight and the challenges in controlling risk within the non-commercial aviation sector (3.44).
Themes for 2012_201: 
Vessel Stability and Loading
Vessel stability and proper loading are critical for the safety of maritime operations. In the case of the Easy Rider, the vessel was "loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff" (5.2). The vessel's stability was compromised due to the extra load of cargo on deck and the passengers themselves, which raised the center of gravity and consequently reduced the stability reserve (4.3.7). This made the vessel "tender," meaning it would take only a small force or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel to take on an angle (4.3.8). The vessel's poor stability was a prime factor leading to its capsize when it was hit by a large breaking wave (5.16).

Weather Conditions and Voyage Planning
Weather conditions and proper voyage planning are essential for ensuring the safety of maritime travel. The Easy Rider embarked on its journey despite forecasts of unsuitable weather conditions, including high winds and significant wave heights (4.4.1). The vessel ventured across Foveaux Strait at night with "marginal stability and with passengers on board," which was not suitable given the weather conditions (5.3). The skipper's decision to proceed with the voyage was influenced by a pre-arranged rendezvous with a helicopter, which may have pressured the decision to sail despite the weather (5.4).

Safety Equipment and Emergency Preparedness
The availability and proper use of safety equipment and emergency preparedness are vital for survival in the event of a maritime accident. The Easy Rider did not have sufficient life-saving equipment for the nine persons on board, and the life-raft was not able to float free to the surface because it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as the vessel was sinking (5.10). Additionally, the vessel's manually operated emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) had probably not been intentionally activated and was found still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the vessel sank (5.6). The lack of adequate life-saving equipment and the failure to activate the EPIRB significantly reduced the chances of survival for those on board.

Qualifications and Training of Crew
The qualifications and training of the crew are crucial for the safe operation of a vessel. In this incident, the skipper of the Easy Rider did not hold the qualification required to be in charge of the vessel on the accident voyage (5.15). The skipper also lacked the requisite knowledge of ship stability, which is fundamental for any commercial operator and is covered in the qualifications he was required but failed to have (5.16). This lack of proper qualifications and training contributed to the skipper's inability to recognize the vessel's compromised stability and the risks associated with the voyage.

Regulatory Compliance and Safe Ship Management
Compliance with maritime regulations and adherence to safe ship management practices are essential for the safety of maritime operations. The Easy Rider was not operated in compliance with safe ship management obligations, as the owner did not understand the principles of safe ship management, and the skipper did not show a willingness to comply with the rules (5.13). The vessel was operating as a commercial fishing vessel without the necessary dispensation to operate as a pleasure vessel for the accident voyage, and it should not have been carrying any person other than its crew (5.12). The failure to comply with regulatory requirements and safe ship management practices was a significant factor in the accident.

Record-Keeping and Information Management
Proper record-keeping and information management are important for maintaining the safety of vessels over time. In the case of the Easy Rider, there was difficulty accessing sufficient information about the vessel due to historical issues with record-keeping standards (5.16). The lack of a central database for important safety and operation records for vessels in the system can lead to the loss of critical information that could inform safety practices and prevent future accidents (5.14). The absence of accurate and complete records on the Easy Rider's modifications and stability assessments hindered the ability to fully understand and address the vessel's stability issues.
Themes for 2010_201: 
Enclosed Space Entry Procedures
Enclosed Space Entry Procedures are a set of guidelines and practices designed to ensure the safety of individuals entering spaces with limited openings, unfavorable natural ventilation, or not designed for continuous worker occupancy. This theme is relevant to the accident because the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space without checking if the atmosphere was suitable for entry and without following the appropriate safety precautions, leading to asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation ("The accident sequence started when the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space without checking that the atmosphere was suitable for entry and without following the appropriate safety precautions" (4.2.1)). Furthermore, the document highlights that despite the introduction of recommendations on entry into enclosed spaces by the IMO in 1997, accidents continued to happen, indicating a persistent safety issue in the maritime industry ("Despite the introduction of the recommendations on entry into enclosed spaces by the IMO in 1997, accidents continued to happen" (4.4.3)).

Oxygen Depletion and Toxic Gas Awareness
Oxygen Depletion and Toxic Gas Awareness is the understanding of the risks associated with the depletion of oxygen and the presence of toxic gases in enclosed spaces. This theme is crucial to the accident as the log cargo in the hold depleted the oxygen levels to a critically low range that could not sustain life for more than a few minutes, and the presence of other toxic gases such as CO and H2S was likely ("oxygen levels in the cargo hold would have been depleted by the organic decomposition of the logs and toxic gases such as co, co2 and h2s may also have been present" (4.3)). The chief officer's lack of awareness or disregard for these dangers was a direct contributing factor to the fatalities ("The chief officer would not have been able to detect the presence of 3 of the toxic gases produced by the logs" (4.3.2)).

Emergency Response Training and Drills
Emergency Response Training and Drills involve preparing crew members through education and practice to respond effectively to emergencies, such as rescuing individuals from enclosed spaces. This theme is relevant because the document indicates that there was no evidence of enclosed space rescue drills or training performed on the ship in the previous three months leading up to the accident, which could have increased the crew's preparedness and possibly prevented the fatalities ("Being a dedicated log carrier the risk of death by entering enclosed cargo holds containing logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency response training programme, yet no evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed" (5.4)).

Safety Culture and Compliance
Safety Culture and Compliance refer to the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety, as well as adherence to safety regulations and procedures. This theme is relevant as the document suggests a breakdown in the chain of responsibility for ensuring compliance with safety legislation and company operating procedures, which may have contributed to the accident ("Having rules, regulations and guidelines does not in itself ensure compliance with them" (4.4.4)). The chief officer's decision to enter the hold despite warnings from the bosun indicates a lapse in safety culture and compliance ("it could not be established why the chief officer, a veteran of the sea, and senior officer on board would have ignored the warnings given by the bosun and entered the cargo hold" (5.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Risk Assessment and Management
Risk Assessment and Management involves identifying potential hazards, assessing the risks associated with them, and implementing measures to control or eliminate the risks. This theme is relevant to the accident as the document indicates that the ship's Safety Management System (SSM) failed to mitigate the known high-risk of entering enclosed cargo holds, suggesting inadequate risk assessment and management practices ("The SSM failed to mitigate what was known to be a high-risk to the crew" (4.4.6)). The absence of specific training for the crew on the dangers of entering enclosed cargo holds and the lack of enclosed space drills further underscore the failure in risk management ("No record could be found of specific training for the crew to highlight the danger of entering enclosed cargo holds, nor had an enclosed space drill been held" (4.4.6)).

Coordinated Emergency Response
Coordinated Emergency Response is the organized and efficient reaction to an emergency situation, ensuring that all responders act in a unified and effective manner. This theme is relevant as the document describes the crew's response to the emergency as uncoordinated and independent, which delayed the rescue efforts and potentially impacted the survivability of the victims ("The way in which the crew responded to the emergency was indicative of insufficient knowledge and inadequate training on board the TPC Wellington" (4.5.1)). The lack of a coordinated response is further highlighted by the master's and third officer's actions, which were not aligned and led to further delays ("The master, on receiving the call, rather than sounding the alarm, went to see what was happening, as did the third officer" (4.5.3)).
Themes for 2011_101: 
Communication and Crew Resource Management
Communication and crew resource management are critical for ensuring safety in rail operations. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report highlights that the "KiwiRail train controller's plan to cross Trains 210 and 201 at Papakura was not disseminated to all the parties who needed to know" (4.1.31). This lack of communication led to missed opportunities to avert the potential head-on collision. Furthermore, despite previous recommendations to improve communication standards, "this incident demonstrates that the standard has not reached an acceptable level" (4.1.27, 5.7).

Signaller Training and Certification
The adequacy of signaller training and certification is a safety theme because it directly impacts the ability of personnel to manage complex rail operations safely. In this incident, the signaller "had only 8 months' total experience as a signal box controller and had not worked there in the previous 6 months" (5.4), which may not have been sufficient to deal with the complexity of operations. Additionally, there were "gaps noted relating to her practical training using the mis.60 procedure" (4.1.33 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), indicating that the signaller was not fully prepared for the tasks required during the incident.

Workload and Task Complexity
Workload and task complexity are safety themes because they can affect the performance of personnel responsible for safety-critical tasks. The report suggests that the signaller "was likely to have been distracted by other tasks that had been assigned to her" (5.3), which contributed to her losing sight of the train controller's plan. The signaller was also "nervous about managing the complexity of the work at the Papakura signal box" (4.1.20), indicating that the complexity of the tasks exceeded her comfort level and experience.

Procedural Compliance and Blocking Procedures
Procedural compliance and the effectiveness of blocking procedures are safety themes because they are designed to prevent accidents like the potential head-on collision described in the report. The incident occurred when the signaller "removed a collar that was supposed to remind her to seek authorisation from train control before changing the aspect on Signal 3A to green" (4.1.2). The report also identified a design flaw in the "blocking" procedure (4.1.4), which failed to provide the necessary double reminder for the signaller.

Fatigue Management
Fatigue management is a safety theme because fatigue can impair the performance of personnel responsible for safety-critical functions. The report examined the signaller's work roster and fatigue from extended working hours (4.1.14). Although it was determined that fatigue due to the roster alone was "unlikely to have been suffering from fatigue at the time of the incident" (4.1.17), the theme is still relevant as the signaller had worked "12 of the previous 13 days before the incident" (4.1.15), which could have affected her alertness and cognitive function.

Safety Observations and Performance Monitoring
Safety observations and performance monitoring are safety themes because they ensure that personnel maintain compliance with safety procedures and performance standards. The report found that "Veolia had not properly managed the new function of providing signallers for 3 signal boxes in the Auckland metro train network" (5.8) and that "5 of its 8 signallers, including the one involved in this incident, had not undergone the required safety observations" (5.8). This lack of oversight and monitoring contributed to the incident.
Themes for 2020_201: 
Bridge Resource Management
Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Rose Harmony, poor BRM was identified as a significant factor contributing to the collision. The situational awareness of the bridge team was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters (3.11). Additionally, the report highlights the importance of good communication and coordinated actions as part of effective BRM, which was lacking during the emergency situation (3.18, 3.19).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and accurately anticipating potential future events. In this accident, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo suffered from low situational awareness. The Rose Harmony's bridge team had low situational awareness of other marine traffic, which was a contributing factor to the collision (4.3). Similarly, the sole watchkeeper on the Leila Jo had low situational awareness as to the risk of collision with the Rose Harmony because the radar equipment was not used to plot the track of the Rose Harmony (4.5).

Adherence to Collision Regulations
Adherence to collision regulations is crucial for the prevention of accidents at sea. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) provide rules to be followed to prevent collisions. In this incident, neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules, which directly led to the collision (4.1). Both vessels were required to alter course to starboard to pass on the port side of each other, which did not occur (4.2).

Use of Radar Equipment
Proper use of radar equipment is essential for early detection of potential collisions and for maintaining situational awareness. In the case of the Rose Harmony, the radars were set on short range for the entire pilotage, which likely delayed the detection of the Leila Jo (3.13). The crew's improper use of radar equipment and the absence of long-range scanning were significant factors contributing to the low situational awareness (4.4).

Training and Familiarity with Safety Regulations
Adequate training and familiarity with safety regulations are fundamental for ensuring that crew members can effectively perform their duties. The deckhand on the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to be left in sole charge of the watch, which was a safety issue contributing to the accident (3.25, 3.27, 3.37). The report also notes that the training system in place was not consistent with the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 31, which requires owners, skippers, and watchkeepers to take account of the standards of STCW-F (3.38).

Distraction by Non-Essential Personnel
The presence of non-essential personnel on the bridge can be a significant source of distraction for the bridge team, affecting their ability to manage the vessel's conduct effectively. During the pilotage of the Rose Harmony, the presence of passengers on the bridge was problematic and affected the bridge team's performance at a critical time (3.21, 3.23). The report cites previous incidents where distraction by passengers on the bridge led to adverse outcomes, emphasizing the relevance of this safety theme to the accident (3.24).
Themes for 2020_001: 
Pilot Incapacitation
Pilot incapacitation refers to a situation where a pilot is unable to perform their duties due to a medical or other physical condition. This theme is relevant to the accident because the investigation found it "about as likely as not that the pilot was incapacitated early in the take-off roll" (3.25). The lack of any corrective action by the pilot, such as discontinuing the take-off or correcting the take-off path, suggests that the pilot may have been incapacitated and therefore unable to perform such actions (3.21, 3.22). The absence of evidence of any corrective action supports the possibility of incapacitation (3.24).

Mechanical Failure
Mechanical failure encompasses any malfunction or breakdown of aircraft components that can lead to an accident. In this case, mechanical failure was considered but ultimately ruled out as a causal factor. The investigation found no evidence of a failure in the aircraft's powerplant, as the engine was "delivering full power during the take-off roll and at the time of impact" (3.9). Similarly, there was no indication of a failure in the airframe systems, such as flight controls or steering, during the take-off roll (3.10). The undercarriage was dislodged due to a high-impact event during the accident sequence, not as a cause of the accident (3.11).

Airstrip Suitability
Airstrip suitability refers to the condition and appropriateness of the airstrip for the intended operation. This theme is relevant because the airstrip's condition was assessed as part of the investigation. Witness evidence indicated that the airstrip was suitable for agricultural operations on the day of the accident, and the pilot had not expressed any concerns about the airstrip condition during the previous flights that day (3.18). Another pilot also commented that the airstrip posed no unusual hazards or challenges (3.18).

Pilot Training and Competency
Pilot training and competency are critical factors in ensuring that pilots can handle the aircraft and respond to emergencies appropriately. In this accident, the pilot's training and competency were examined and found not to be causal factors. The pilot had undergone a competency check six months prior to the accident and was very experienced in agricultural operations and the specific type of aircraft involved in the accident (3.15). Additionally, there was evidence that the pilot had previously shown no reluctance in jettisoning loads when required, indicating their competency in handling emergency procedures (3.16).

Organizational Influences
Organizational influences include the policies, procedures, and safety culture of the operating entity. The investigation looked into the operator's Safety Management System, incident register, exposition, and manuals but did not identify any historical or systemic issues that could have been relevant or causal factors in this accident (3.19). This suggests that organizational influences were not a contributing factor to the accident, but their examination is a standard part of accident investigations to ensure comprehensive analysis.

Substance Use
Substance use by pilots can impair their ability to operate an aircraft safely. In this accident, toxicology examinations were conducted post-mortem, and apart from caffeine, no other drugs were detected in the pilot's blood (3.20). This indicates that substance use was not a factor in the accident, but it is a safety theme that is typically investigated to rule out impairment as a cause of aviation accidents.
Themes for 2016_101: 
Ineffective Non-Technical Skills (NTS)
Non-Technical Skills (NTS), formerly known as Crew Resource Management, refer to the cognitive, social, and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance. In the context of this accident, the NTS between the driver, the Train Examiner Officer (TXO), and the signaller were ineffective, as there was no communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed, and no conversation reported between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train ("there had been no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed Platform 7" (4.2.1), "No conversation is reported to have taken place between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train" (4.2.7)). This lack of communication and coordination could have contributed to the driver's error and the near-miss incident.

Signal Recognition and Visibility
Signal recognition and visibility are crucial for train drivers to make correct decisions. In this incident, the driver mistook a green signal meant for another train as his own due to the non-illuminated and non-reflective arrows on the signals, which were difficult to see in the dark and rain ("Instead of stopping his train at the Red signal 100 on his left, the driver of the relay train mistook the Green signal 99 on his right as being for his train" (4.2.4), "the arrows are not illuminated or reflective and are difficult to see in the dark and the rain" (4.2.4)). This indicates that the signal visibility was not adequate under all operating conditions, leading to the potential for misinterpretation and accidents.

Congested Track Layout
The congested track layout near Wellington Station increases the risk of train collisions due to limited space and a complex track layout that has remained relatively unchanged since 1937 ("there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested" (4.1.2), "The track layout and associated control system between Wellington Station platforms, and the lines into and out of Wellington and those to the surrounding storage yards or maintenance depots, have remained relatively unchanged since 1937" (4.3.1)). This outdated and congested layout contributes to the risk of accidents, as it complicates train movements and signal interpretation.

Lack of Modern Safety Systems
The absence of modern safety systems such as Automatic Train Protection or the European Train Control System (ETCS) in the Wellington area means that the system is highly reliant on drivers always stopping at a red light, without additional technological safeguards to prevent collisions ("the existing layout means there are no safety overlaps designed into this area and few fail-safe back-up systems in place in the event of a spad" (4.3.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The Wellington Signalbox controlled area is based on 1930s' vintage signalling principles" (4.3.4)). This reliance on human performance without modern safety systems increases the risk of accidents due to human error.

Inconsistent Signalling Procedures
Inconsistent signalling procedures can lead to confusion and errors by train drivers. In this case, there were no written guidelines or procedures on how early a signaller can preset part of the route prior to a planned departure, leading to a lack of consistency in how signallers should signal and route a given movement ("kiwirail had no written guidelines, instructions or procedures on how early a signaller can preset part of the route prior to a planned departure" (4.4.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "Without procedures or guidelines, signallers can achieve the same movement multiple different ways" (4.4.7)). This lack of standardization can create situations where drivers are unsure of the correct signals, increasing the risk of accidents.

Inadequate Risk Mitigation Measures
The measures in place to mitigate the risk of trains colliding in the Wellington Station area did not reduce the risk as far as reasonably practicable. The system relied on drivers stopping at red signals without sufficient checks or defenses to prevent collisions in case of human error ("train drivers failing to stop their trains at red signals is a known and foreseeable risk. there should therefore have been checks or defenses built into the system" (5.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The measures relied on to mitigate the risk of trains colliding in the Wellington Station area did not reduce the risk as far as reasonably practicable" (5.4)). This indicates that the existing risk mitigation strategies were insufficient to address the known risks adequately.
Themes for 2019_101: 
Communication
Communication is a critical non-technical skill that involves the exchange of information, clarification of tasks, and confirmation of actions to ensure mutual understanding. In the context of this accident, communication failures were a significant factor. The RPO and the signals technician did not effectively communicate the nature and potential implications of the technician's work, leading to a misunderstanding about the necessity of locking on for safety ("Had the signals technician and RPO communicated more effectively regarding the nature and potential implications of the signals technician's intended work" (3.16)). This lack of clear communication contributed to the RPO's incorrect assumption about the technician's work and the subsequent removal of electronic blocking, which put the technician at risk ("Instead, they had incorrectly assumed that the work was related to removing the secondary protection" (3.8)).

Situational Awareness
Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and anticipating potential future states. It is relevant to this accident because the RPO lacked situational awareness regarding the signals technician's location and activities. The RPO believed the technician was working clear of the track and did not realize the technician was at risk when the electronic blocking was removed ("Unknown to the technician, the RPO believed that the technician was working clear of the track" (3.11)). This misunderstanding was a direct result of the RPO's lack of situational awareness, which could have been improved with better communication and a shared mental model of the work being undertaken ("this transfer of knowledge would have also likely improved the rpo's situational awareness" (3.16 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).

Procedural Adherence
Procedural adherence refers to the consistent application of established protocols and procedures to maintain safety. In this incident, the RPO allowed the signals technician to enter the PWA without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902, which was a significant breach of safety protocol ("On this occasion the RPO allowed a signals technician to enter the PWA without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902" (3.2)). This lapse in procedural adherence was a direct contributor to the unsafe conditions that led to the accident.

Non-Technical Skills Training
Non-technical skills training encompasses the development of cognitive, social, and personal resource skills that complement technical skills. Despite all key personnel having undergone training in non-technical skills, the incident highlighted the importance of these skills in creating a safe working environment and preventing misunderstandings ("Nevertheless, the incident highlighted the importance of these skills in creating a safe working environment and ensuring that there are no misunderstandings" (3.15)). The failure to effectively apply non-technical skills, such as communication and situational awareness, was a contributing factor to the accident.

Challenge and Response
Challenge and response is a safety practice where personnel are encouraged to question unclear or potentially unsafe situations and expect a clarification or correction. This practice was not effectively utilized in the incident, as there was a missed opportunity for the signals technician to challenge the RPO on the necessity to lock on, which could have led to a better understanding of the proposed work and potentially prevented the accident ("There was a missed opportunity for the signals technician to challenge the RPO on the necessity to lock on" (3.17)).

Fatigue Management
Fatigue management involves strategies to prevent accidents that may occur due to personnel being tired or overworked. Although the work period was extended by one hour, there was no evidence of fatigue having been a factor in this occurrence, indicating that fatigue management protocols were likely followed ("Although the work period was extended by one hour, there was no evidence of fatigue having been a factor in the occurrence" (3.25)). However, it remains a relevant safety theme as extended work periods can contribute to accidents if not properly managed.
Themes for 2015_101: 
Pedestrian Awareness
Pedestrian awareness is a critical safety theme that involves the attentiveness and situational awareness of individuals in the vicinity of moving vehicles or trains. In the context of this accident, the pedestrian's awareness was compromised as he "was seen to be using his mobile phone while he walked down the platform ramp and he had bud-style earphones inserted in his ears" (3.1.8). The use of mobile devices and earphones can distract pedestrians from their surroundings, including auditory warnings such as train whistles, which in this case "the driver used the train whistle appropriately to warn pedestrians that the train was approaching" (3.1.9). The pedestrian's lack of awareness due to distraction is a significant safety theme related to this accident.

Auditory Warning Signals
Auditory warning signals are designed to alert individuals of impending danger, such as the approach of a train. This safety theme is relevant to the accident as the data recorders confirmed that "the flashing lights, audible bells and physical barriers at the Morningside Drive road level crossing were operating correctly and continuously for both trains" (3.1.9). Despite the correct operation of these warning systems, the pedestrian was wearing earphones connected to his mobile phone, which may have prevented him from hearing the auditory warnings, including the train whistle, thereby contributing to the accident.

Visual Distractions
Visual distractions can divert a pedestrian's attention away from potential hazards. In this incident, the pedestrian's attention was likely focused on his mobile phone, as he "was seen to be using his mobile phone while he walked down the platform ramp" (3.1.8). This distraction could have prevented him from noticing the approaching Waitākere-bound train, despite the presence of safety measures such as flashing lights and physical barriers, which were confirmed to be functioning properly (3.1.9). The pedestrian's visual distraction by the mobile phone is a pertinent safety theme in this accident.

Compliance with Safety Barriers
Compliance with safety barriers is a theme that involves individuals adhering to the protective measures put in place to prevent accidents. In this case, the pedestrian did not comply with the safety barriers as he "turned right through an opening and stepped out in front of the train" (3.1.7). The presence of "physical barriers at the Morningside Drive road level crossing" (3.1.9) indicates that there were measures in place to prevent such incidents, but the pedestrian's actions suggest a lack of compliance with these barriers, making this theme relevant to the accident.

Train Operation and Speed
Train operation and speed refer to how trains are driven and managed on the tracks, including adherence to speed limits and the use of warning signals. This theme is relevant as the report indicates that "the Waitākere-bound train was being driven at below the maximum line speed and the driver used the train whistle appropriately" (3.1.9). Although the train operation met safety standards, the accident still occurred, suggesting that other factors, such as pedestrian behavior and awareness, played a more significant role in this incident.

Level Crossing Safety Measures
Level crossing safety measures include all the engineered systems and warnings in place at intersections where roads and railway tracks meet. This theme is relevant to the accident as it occurred at a level crossing, and the report confirms that "the flashing lights, audible bells and physical barriers at the Morningside Drive road level crossing were operating correctly and continuously for both trains" (3.1.9). Despite these measures, the accident happened, indicating that while the safety measures were functioning, their effectiveness can be compromised by factors such as pedestrian distraction and non-compliance.
Themes for 2010_001: 
Weather Information Dissemination
Weather information dissemination is a critical safety theme in aviation, as it pertains to the processes and systems used to communicate weather-related hazards to flight crews. In this accident, the effectiveness of the system for reporting and updating severe weather information was a central focus of the inquiry ("The focus of this inquiry was on the effectiveness of the system for the reporting and updating of severe weather information that could affect aircraft operations" (3.1)). The crews may not have been aware of SIGMETs 28 and 31, which directly affected their planned routes and levels, due to limitations in the operator's dispatch system for updating flight information ("However, which weather briefings were used could not be confirmed, and it was possible that neither crew was aware of SIGMETs 28 and 31" (3.2), "Limitations in the operator's dispatch system for updating flight information might have been a cause of the crews not receiving updated weather information" (3.4)). This theme is relevant because the lack of awareness of updated weather information may have contributed to the crews encountering severe turbulence.

Crew Preparedness and Training
Crew preparedness and training are essential for ensuring that pilots can effectively respond to in-flight emergencies, such as severe turbulence. The report highlights the value of simulator training in preparing the pilots to recognize and recover from the upsets experienced during the turbulence ("The suggestions by some of the pilots that the aeroplanes' behaviour during the turbulence was very similar to that experienced in earlier simulator training proved the value of such training" (3.12)). This theme is relevant to the accident because the pilots' prior experience and training likely assisted them in managing the severe turbulence without incurring injury or damage, demonstrating the importance of robust training programs for flight safety.

Communication Protocols
Communication protocols are a safety theme that involves the procedures and standards for effective communication between flight crews and air traffic control (ATC). In this incident, the first controller did not recognize the urgency of the situation when the crew of NZ5046 reported their inability to maintain altitude, responding with a non-committal 'Roger' instead of taking action to assist the flight ("The first controller did not hear the PAN call from NZ5046" (3.13)). This theme is relevant because effective communication is critical during emergencies, and the controller's passive response did not contribute to the management of the severe turbulence event.

Pilot Decision Making
Pilot decision making is a safety theme that encompasses the cognitive processes by which pilots determine their actions in response to various situations. In this case, the pilots' decision to cruise at flight level 170 above the turbulent level forecast in SIGMET 24 was based on their expectation of moderate turbulence ("Both crews had expected moderate turbulence to be present along the route, and had therefore chosen to cruise at flight level 170" (3.2)). This theme is relevant because the pilots' decisions regarding route and flight level selection were based on the weather information they had, which may not have included the latest updates, affecting their ability to avoid or mitigate the severe turbulence.

Air Traffic Control Procedures
Air traffic control (ATC) procedures are a safety theme related to the standardized practices that controllers follow to manage air traffic safely. The report discusses the Airways procedure for providing weather information to pilots upon first contact as a defense against last-minute changes that might affect a flight ("The Airways procedure for providing this information when a pilot made first contact was a useful defence against ‘last minute' changes that might affect a flight" (3.5)). This theme is relevant to the accident because the procedures followed by ATC, or lack thereof, can significantly impact flight safety, as evidenced by the controller's failure to pass on the pirep from NZ5046, which could have improved the procedure within ATC ("The delay in ATC passing the pirep from NZ5046 to MetService had no bearing on the subsequent encounter by NZ5034, but suggested the procedure within ATC could be improved" (4.8)).

SIGMET Interpretation and Clarity
The interpretation and clarity of SIGMETs (Significant Meteorological Information) are crucial for pilots and flight dispatchers to understand and respond appropriately to weather-related hazards. The report identifies a safety issue where SIGMETs can be misleading or lack clarity due to insufficient reference to recognizable geographic regions ("the commission made a recommendation to the director of civil aviation that he address the safety issue whereby sigmets can be misleading or lack clarity because of insufficient reference to recognizable geographic regions" (3.20 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant to the accident because the correct interpretation of SIGMETs is vital for flight planning and safety, and any ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and potential exposure to hazardous weather conditions.
Themes for 2018_101: 
Rail Fracture and Material Defects
Rail fracture and material defects are a critical safety theme as they directly impact the structural integrity of the railway infrastructure. In this accident, the derailment was caused by a fractured switch rail, which was a result of a manufacturing defect where a chamfer had been machined on the foot of the switch rail. This defect "likely resulted in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture resistance of the rail" (4.3.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The fracture initiated at this defect, which was located at a point of maximum in-service rail loading (4.4.3, 4.4.9). The presence of chatter marks, a type of machining defect, was identified as the point of fracture initiation (4.3.7). This theme is relevant because the physical condition of the rail infrastructure is fundamental to train operation safety, and defects in the materials can lead to catastrophic failures such as derailments.

Inspection and Detection Methods
Inspection and detection methods are a safety theme that encompasses the procedures and technologies used to identify potential rail defects before they result in an incident. In this case, the chatter marks on the outer foot of the rail, which led to the fracture, could not be observed by current inspection procedures once the switch rail had been installed (4.5.1). Ultrasonic testing, which is part of the regular inspection regime, has limitations and is unable to detect defects originating from the foot of the rail unless they propagate into the web (4.5.6). This theme is relevant to the accident because effective inspection methods are essential for the early detection of rail defects, which can prevent derailments and ensure the ongoing safety of rail operations.

Signalling System Limitations
Signalling system limitations are a safety theme that refers to the constraints of the signalling technology in detecting track occupancy and potential rail breaks. In this accident, the signalling system provided a proceed signal into the damaged section because the electrical circuit was completed despite the broken switch rail (4.2.4). The axle-counter system used in Auckland, which does not require the track to be circuited, is not designed to detect broken rails (4.6.4-4.6.9). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for signalling systems to have the capability to detect broken rails to prevent accidents, as regular inspections alone may not be sufficient.

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
Manufacturing and quality assurance are safety themes that relate to the processes and standards in place to ensure that rail components are produced without defects that could compromise safety. The switch rail that fractured had been manufactured with a defect introduced during the machining process (4.4.3). The supply agreement did not specify a surface roughness standard for machined components, which allowed for the presence of chatter marks (4.4.4). Additionally, KiwiRail was unable to provide a certificate of compliance for the order, which raises concerns about the quality assurance process (4.4.5). This theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the importance of stringent manufacturing and quality assurance practices to prevent the introduction of defects that can lead to rail failures.

Emergency Response Procedures
Emergency response procedures are a safety theme that includes the actions taken by train personnel and emergency services in the event of an accident. In this incident, the driver immediately realized something was wrong and activated the train's emergency brake, stopping the train close to a concrete wall (4.2.7). The operator has instructed drivers on the actions to take in the event of a derailment, emphasizing the importance of the emergency mushroom and communication with train control (4.7.4). This theme is relevant as it highlights the critical role of effective emergency response in mitigating the consequences of an accident and ensuring the safety of passengers and crew.

Rail Infrastructure Maintenance and Upgrade History
Rail infrastructure maintenance and upgrade history is a safety theme that considers the historical context of the rail components and their maintenance records. The switch rail that fractured was part of a set of points installed during a Christmas closedown in 2012 (4.4.2). There had been no failures of a similar nature on the New Zealand network since electronic recordkeeping began in 1995 (4.4.7). This theme is relevant because understanding the history of rail infrastructure components, including their installation and maintenance, can provide insights into potential safety risks and inform future safety improvements.
Themes for 2016_201: 
Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
The absence of fire detection equipment and automatic fire alarms was a significant safety issue in the accident involving the PeeJay V. The vessel, certified to carry up to 90 passengers and operating up to 12 nm from the coast, "very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed" (4.3 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of early detection systems meant that the crew had "less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life-saving apparatus" (5.2), which is crucial in managing a fire emergency effectively and ensuring the safety of passengers and crew.

CO2 Fire Suppression System Effectiveness
The CO2 fixed fire-fighting system installed in the engine room of the PeeJay V was rendered ineffective due to the inability to fully close down the space it was protecting. The report states that "the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system installed in the engine room could not be fully effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed down" (4.1.3). This was due to several factors, including ventilation flaps that were not closed in time and other openings that allowed air to enter the engine room (4.4.6). The crew's lack of understanding of the importance of sealing the engine room before activating the CO2 system contributed to the system's ineffectiveness (4.6.1).

Crew Training and Familiarity with Safety Systems
The crew's insufficient familiarity with the principles of the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system was a contributing factor to the accident. The report indicates that the crew and operators "did not fully appreciate the principles underlying how a fixed fire-fighting co2 flooding systems works" (4.6 (invalid formatted quote)). Their training was limited to instructions printed on a notice and did not encompass a comprehensive understanding of the system's operation (4.6.2). This lack of knowledge meant they were unable to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire (5.4).

Engine Room Construction and Integrity
The construction of the engine room did not allow for it to be fully sealed, which was a critical factor in the failure of the CO2 fire suppression system. The engine room had at least two ducts that could not be closed or sealed in the event of a fire, and the surveyor was unaware of this, which allowed CO2 to escape and fresh air to enter the engine room (4.5.4). This design flaw demonstrates "limited appreciation of a critical feature of CO2 flooding systems" (4.5.6) and directly impacted the ability to control the fire.

Life-Saving Equipment Accessibility
The placement and storage of life-saving equipment on the PeeJay V were well thought out, but the rapid spread of the fire obstructed access to most of the life-jackets and the Carley float. The report states that "the speed with which the fire obstructed access meant a high percentage of the life-jackets and the carley float could not be accessed" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This issue highlights the importance of not only having life-saving equipment on board but also ensuring that it is accessible in all emergency scenarios.

Maritime Safety Regulation Compliance
The PeeJay V complied with existing maritime safety regulations, but the regulations did not mandate the installation of fire detection or automatic fire alarms for a vessel of its size, which was under 24 meters in length (4.3.7). This regulatory gap meant that the vessel operated without these critical safety features, which could have provided an earlier warning and more effective response to the fire. The report suggests that maritime rules are minimum standards and that operators can install a greater level of safety commensurate with the risk involved (4.3.8).
Themes for 2018_001: 
Reserve Parachute Malfunction
The reserve parachute malfunction is a critical safety theme in this accident. The reserve parachute developed a tension knot during deployment, which the tandem master was unable to clear, leading to a deformed canopy and an uncontrolled descent. "The reserve parachute developed a tension knot as it opened that the tandem master was unable to clear. The tension knot deformed the right rear part of the canopy, and this resulted in the tandem pair descending in a steep, right-hand spiral turn until they struck the water at Lake Wakatipu" (4.3). The cause of the tension knot could not be conclusively determined, highlighting the unpredictability and severity of such malfunctions (4.4).

Inadequate Emergency Response Plan
The operator's emergency response plan did not account for the minimum survival time for people immersed in cold water, making it an important safety theme. "The operator's plan did not ensure parachutists were rescued in a time appropriate for survival in the conditions, nor did it have a vessel to implement such a recovery" (3.82). The water temperature, which was about 10° Celsius, limited the likely survival time of the tandem pair, and the operator's water emergency response plan could not get rescuers to a parachutist within five minutes of their entering the water at Lake Wakatipu (3.83, 3.84).

Lifejacket Malfunction
The malfunction of the lifejacket used during the parachute descent is a significant safety theme. The tandem rider's lifejacket could not be inflated sufficiently to support the rider's head above water, and the reason for the lifejacket not inflating fully could not be conclusively determined (4.6, 4.7). Additionally, the operator did not have a maintenance and inspection programme in place for its lifejackets to ensure they remained in a serviceable condition (4.8).

Parachute Packing Technique
The parachute packing technique is a safety theme related to the accident, as it likely contributed to the main parachute's asymmetric inflation and subsequent line twist. "the main parachute's packing likely contributed to its opening asymmetrically" (4.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The independent industry advisor believed that the packing likely contributed to the asymmetrical main canopy inflation, leading to a line twist (3.41).

Lack of Regulatory Clarity for Water Operations
The lack of clear regulatory requirements for parachuting operations near significant bodies of water is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. "The Civil Aviation Rules for parachuting near a significant body of water are not well defined in Part 105" (5.7). This lack of definition in the rules could lead to procedures implemented by Part 115 parachute operators that do not meet minimum levels of safety when operating near water (5.7).

Inadequate Data Collection for Safety Management
Inadequate data collection for safety management in the parachute sector is a safety theme, as the CAA dataset for parachuting occurrences did not include key fields, which likely reduced its effectiveness as a tool for safety management in the sector (4.13). "This mismatch between submitted occurrence data from operators and a reduced subset of data recorded by the CAA was a lost opportunity for the CAA to gain national insights into the safety performance of the parachute sector" (3.89).
Themes for 2018_202: 
Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
The theme of fire detection and alarm systems is highly relevant to this accident because the automatic fire-alarm and fire-detection system installed on the Dong Won 701 failed to detect the fire and sound the general alarm. "During this fire the fire-detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm" (3.12). This failure delayed the firefighting response, which is critical for the safety of ship and crew, as early detection allows for immediate response and potential extinguishment of the fire before it escalates (3.11). The reasons for the system's failure to activate could include a fault with the smoke detector, an interruption in power supply, or the system being left in manual mode (3.15). The crew also did not use manual push-button alarms to raise the alarm for everyone on board (3.18).

Crew Response and Firefighting Procedures
The crew's response to the fire and their adherence to firefighting procedures is a significant safety theme because the crew's actions did not meet industry good practice. "Some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice" (3.3). The crew did not follow the vessel's emergency checklists appropriately, did not evacuate the vessel until ordered by the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ), and failed to account for all crew members (3.21). Additionally, after initial attempts to fight the fire, the crew left doors and ventilation flaps open, allowing the fire to spread rapidly (3.22-3.23). The uncoordinated response continued until FENZ took command (3.26).

Fire-Resistant Design and Construction
Fire-resistant design and construction is a pertinent safety theme because the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701 did not meet contemporary standards, which contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. "The structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701, although complying with the relevant Maritime Rule, did not meet contemporary standards" (4.4). The vessel was considered a pre-2004 ship and was 'grandparented,' meaning it was deemed compliant with Rule 40D without meeting modern safety standards (3.34). This resulted in features such as corridor bulkheads and cabin doors made of combustible materials and stairwells without fire-resistant doors, which allowed the fire to spread quickly (3.37-3.38).

Maritime Rules and Regulatory Consistency
The theme of maritime rules and regulatory consistency is relevant to this accident due to inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D, which may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels not fully complying with the relevant safety standards. "Inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D: Design, Construction and Equipment – Fishing Ships may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards" (3.3). The lack of clarity in the rules and inconsistent application by surveyors prior to 2017 led to a situation where older vessels could operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards (3.40-3.46).

Training and Safety Drills
Training and safety drills are a critical safety theme because, despite the crew of the Dong Won 701 having received approved shore-based firefighting training, their response to the actual fire did not fully comply with company procedures or good industry practice. "The crew of the Dong Won 701 had all received approved shore-based firefighting training" (3.20), yet they did not follow the vessel's firefighting procedures during the emergency (3.21). Regular training and drills are intended to ensure that crew members are prepared to respond effectively in an emergency, but this incident demonstrates a gap between training and actual performance.

Vessel Age and Modern Safety Standards
The age of the vessel and adherence to modern safety standards is a safety theme because the Dong Won 701, being an older vessel, was allowed to operate without meeting newer safety standards due to 'grandparent rights.' "An adverse effect of applying grandparent rights to older standards is that the crews are not afforded the same level of safety" (3.36). This discrepancy in safety standards between older and newer vessels poses a risk to crew safety, as older vessels may not have the same fire-resistant features and may not be equipped with the latest fire detection and suppression technologies (3.37-3.39).
Themes for 2020_101: 
Distracted Driving
Distracted driving is a safety theme relevant to this accident as the truck driver's attention was diverted from the truck's surroundings to an undetermined distraction within the truck's cab. The Commission's analysis suggests that the truck driver was likely aware of the active level crossing signals, as evidenced by the truck slowing down significantly before reaching the level crossing, indicating an intention to stop ("Separate independent accounts from the witness and the train driver observed the truck slowing significantly before it reached the level crossing" (12)). However, the driver's failure to maintain sufficient pressure on the brake pedal and the witness' observation of the driver looking down and reaching into the passenger side area suggest that the driver was distracted and unaware of the truck's forward movement ("The truck’s slow forward crawl towards the level crossing in the lead-up to the collision was very likely due to its driver not applying sufficient pressure to the brake pedal" (12), "It is very likely the truck driver’s peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted" (12)).


Inadequate Risk Assessment and Management for Level Crossings
Inadequate risk assessment and management for level crossings is a safety theme that is central to this accident. The LCSIA report's recommended risk treatments, such as the closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing or the installation of half-arm barriers, were not formally assessed for their practicability using the SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) principle. No documented SFAIRP assessments were provided by the Council or KiwiRail for the recommended risk treatments, which could have prevented the accident if implemented ("Neither the Council nor KiwiRail could provide a documented SFAIRP assessment for the LCSIA report’s recommendation to close Mulcocks Road level crossing" (14), "As with crossing closure, no documented SFAIRP assessment could be provided by the Council or KiwiRail for the installation of half-arm barriers" (15)).


Insufficient Use of Mobile Phones While Driving Legislation
The insufficient use of mobile phones while driving legislation is a safety theme in this accident. Although New Zealand law prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving, the Commission was unable to determine if the truck driver was using the hands-free mounting at the time of the accident. The mobile phone being found outside the truck's cab after the collision does not provide conclusive evidence due to the forces involved in the collision. The driver's engagement in a mobile phone call, while not explaining the lack of visual attention, likely contributed to their overall level of distraction and lack of situational awareness ("The Commission was unable to determine if the truck driver was utilising the hands-free mounting fitted to the truck dashboard at the time of the accident" (13), "The truck driver being engaged in a mobile phone call does not itself explain why their visual attention was not on the truck’s surroundings, but still likely contributed to their overall level of distraction" (13)).


Ineffective Prioritization of Level Crossing Upgrades
Ineffective prioritization of level crossing upgrades is a safety theme that emerges from the analysis of this accident. The selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs and subsequent upgrades is not effectively prioritized towards those representing the greatest risk. The Commission's review indicated that many level crossings with lower ALCAM risk scores were selected for upgrades over those with higher scores, demonstrating a misalignment between estimated risk and prioritization for upgrades ("Selection of level crossings for regular risk review LCSIAs, and indeed upgrade in many cases, is not being effectively prioritised towards those representing the greatest risk" (18), "Figure 11 indicates where selection for ‘regular risk review’ LCSIAs has not been effectively prioritised by ALCAM data" (18)).


Lack of Situational Awareness
Lack of situational awareness is a safety theme related to this accident, as the truck driver's attention was not focused on the truck's surroundings, which included the approaching train. The position of the sun may have further limited the peripheral vision cues available to the truck driver, although sun-strike itself was judged very unlikely to have significantly contributed to the accident. The driver's lack of situational awareness was a critical factor in the truck moving onto the level crossing and into the path of the train ("It is very likely the truck driver’s peripheral vision cues outside of the cab were restricted" (12), "Sun-strike itself is therefore judged very unlikely to have significantly contributed to this accident, but may have further limited the peripheral vision cues available to the truck driver" (13)).


Ambiguity in Risk Assessment Guidance
Ambiguity in risk assessment guidance is a safety theme that, while not directly contributing to the accident, represents a systemic issue in the assessment of level crossing risks. The guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values is ambiguous for scores in the 20.0 – 20.6 range, which could lead to misleading LCSS values in future assessments. This ambiguity could affect the prioritization and decision-making process for level crossing upgrades and risk treatments ("The guidance for converting ALCAM risk scores to LCSS values is ambiguous for ALCAM risk scores in the 20.0 – 20.6 range" (20)).
Themes for 2013_201: 
Firefighting Training and Drills
Firefighting training and drills are essential for ensuring that all crew members are familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report indicates that the drills conducted on board the Taokas Wisdom were not effective in preparing the crew for a real fire event. The report states, "The firefighting drills held on board the Taokas Wisdom were not effective in ensuring that all crew members were familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire" (4.4.3, 5.3). Additionally, the second officer was unaware of his responsibility for controlling ventilation during a fire, which is a critical aspect of firefighting on a ship (4.4.4, 4.3.14).

Command and Control during Firefighting
Establishing an effective command and control system during a firefighting response is crucial to manage the situation efficiently and minimize damage. This theme is relevant because the report highlights the lack of an effective command and control system as a factor that likely reduced the effectiveness of the shipboard firefighting response. The master did not report to the bridge to take control and coordinate the firefighting efforts, and no crew muster was conducted to account for all crew members (4.3.5, 4.3.6, 5.2).

Containment of Fire
Containing a fire to prevent it from spreading is a fundamental aspect of firefighting on ships. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report points out that the fire was not contained within the cabin until the firefighting teams were fully ready to engage. The chief officer attempted to tackle the fire with a portable extinguisher without wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and had to retreat, likely leaving the door open, which allowed the fire to spread (4.3.9, 5.2).

Denying Oxygen to the Fire
Denying oxygen to a fire is essential to extinguishing it, and this can be achieved by closing down the air supply to the space that is on fire. This theme is relevant because the report indicates that the supply of air to the cabin where the fire was located had not been shut down, which allowed the fire to continue burning and spreading. The automatic closing of the recirculation air damper restricted the airflow to some extent, but the fire was force-fed air due to the failure to manually close other dampers (4.3.11, 4.3.14, 5.2).

Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
Fire detection and alarm systems are critical for early fire detection and initiating a prompt response. This theme is relevant as the report discusses the importance of shipboard systems for detecting and responding to fires. Although not directly implicated in the ineffectiveness of the firefighting response in this incident, the report emphasizes the role of early detection systems in mitigating the risk of fire spreading quickly (4.1.1).

Fire Investigation and Evidence Preservation
Conducting a thorough fire investigation and preserving evidence are key to understanding the cause of a fire and preventing future occurrences. This theme is relevant because the report mentions that the Commission was unable to identify a definitive cause for the fire, mainly due to the cleanup efforts of the crew, which disturbed the evidence before a proper investigation could be conducted (4.1.3, 5.1).
Themes for 2014_201: 
Ageing and Material Degradation
Ageing and material degradation is a safety theme that refers to the weakening of vessel materials over time due to continuous use and exposure to operational stresses. This theme is relevant to the accident because the "Dream Weaver" had been in operation for approximately 16 years, and the hull's glass fibre materials had degraded to a point where they were significantly less strong than when initially built (4.2.1, 4.2.6). The general degradation and delamination of the hull shell laminate were symptomatic of fatigue failure mechanisms, which can lead to failure from the general degradation of the material (4.2.2, 4.2.3). The vessel's hull failed in a typically high-stress area for catamaran vessels: in the bridge deck structure near the bow (5.2).

Operating Limitations Awareness
Operating limitations awareness is a safety theme that involves the crew's understanding of the vessel's operational boundaries, such as maximum wave height and speed restrictions. This theme is crucial to the accident because the "Dream Weaver" was being driven too hard, outside its permitted wave-height/speed limitations, for the sea conditions at the time, causing the hull to rupture at its most vulnerable point (5.3). The skipper was vaguely aware of the wave-height/speed restriction table but rarely considered it when operating the vessel, and the table was not incorporated into the Safe Ship Management manual nor clearly placarded at the conning position (4.2.26, 4.2.27).

Design Evolution and Modernization
Design evolution and modernization is a safety theme that addresses the advancements in vessel design and construction methods over time. This theme is relevant because the "Dream Weaver" was built with a hull design typical for the period it was constructed, and since then, both the design and construction methods have evolved (4.1.1, 4.1.2). The bridge deck was closer to the waterline than more modern-style catamarans, which have higher bridge decks to reduce wave slamming forces, indicating that the vessel's design may not have been optimal for current operational conditions (4.1.1).

Emergency Systems Knowledge
Emergency systems knowledge is a safety theme that pertains to the crew's ability to operate on-board emergency systems effectively. This theme is significant to the accident because the crew had not been trained in the operation of the bilge-pumping arrangements, which contributed to their inability to pump out the flooded bow compartment (5.4). The most recent documented training in the use of the bilge-pumping system had been in 2010, and the deckhand confirmed that he had received no training in the use of the secondary emergency bilge-pumping systems (4.3.2).

Housekeeping Practices
Housekeeping practices is a safety theme that involves maintaining cleanliness and order to ensure the safe operation of the vessel. This theme is pertinent to the accident because poor housekeeping practices were identified as a safety issue on board the "Dream Weaver." Small items of equipment and refuse found in the bilge well during the post-accident inspection were blocking the bilge suctions, preventing the primary pump from keeping up with the ingress of water (4.3.5). Additionally, there were other examples of questionable housekeeping practice on board, such as the storage of the LPG gas bottle on the deck (4.3.7).

Structural Modifications and Repairs
Structural modifications and repairs is a safety theme that deals with changes made to the vessel's structure and the implications of such alterations on the vessel's integrity. This theme is relevant because the "Dream Weaver" had undergone modifications such as lengthening the vessel, fitting more powerful engines, and fitting a hydrofoil near the bow, which could have altered or increased the stress field in the bow structure (4.2.12). Previous repairs noted around the vessel, including in the area where the rupture occurred, were evidence that supported the conclusion that the glass laminate in the bow region was significantly less strong than when it had been built (4.2.6).
Themes for 2015_001: 
Turbine Blade Maintenance and Specifications
The theme of turbine blade maintenance and specifications is highly relevant to this accident as the primary cause of the engine failure was a fractured compressor turbine blade, which originated from a fatigue crack in the blade's trailing edge. The blade in question was part of a set of overhauled blades and had been operated for less than half the time before the next inspection was due. The safety issue identified was that the measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same as those for new blades, which could lead to premature failure before the next 3,000-hour inspection ("The measurement specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat repair process were not exactly the same as those for new blades" (4.2)). This indicates that the maintenance and specifications of turbine blades are critical for ensuring the reliability and safety of the aircraft's engine.

Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
Training and preparedness for emergency procedures is a significant safety theme in this accident. The pilot's actions during the emergency evacuation were not in accordance with the training provided by the operator, indicating potential inadequacies in the emergency training program. The pilot baled out through his cockpit window rather than from the cabin rear door and deployed his parachute immediately, which was likely due to natural anxiety and, in part, to inadequate training in emergency procedures by the operator ("The pilot unwittingly jeopardised the evacuation by baling out through his cockpit window rather than from the cabin rear door, and by deploying his parachute immediately" (4.1.3)). Furthermore, the pilot's training had been completed so recently that the correct procedures, if they had been thoroughly understood, should have been fresh in his mind, yet his actions suggested that the training was not adequate ("However, his training had been completed so recently that the correct procedures, if they had been thoroughly understood, should have been fresh in his mind" (4.4.13)). This theme is relevant as proper training and preparedness are essential for ensuring the safety of all occupants during an emergency.

Compliance with Maintenance Procedures
Compliance with maintenance procedures is a critical safety theme as it was likely that the maintenance provider had not fully followed the engine manufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor turbine blades. This oversight could have potentially allowed an existing crack to go undetected ("It was likely that the maintenance provider had not followed fully the engine manufacturer's recommended procedure for inspecting the compressor turbine blades" (5.6)). The importance of adhering to current procedures for tasks related to airworthiness is emphasized, as failure to do so can undermine the intent of the procedures and compromise safety ("If staff do not check that they are using the current procedures for tasks related to airworthiness, the intent of the procedures can be undermined and safety compromised" (4.3.5)). This theme is relevant because the reliability of the aircraft and the safety of its operations are directly affected by the adherence to prescribed maintenance practices.

Use of Overhauled vs. New Components
The use of overhauled versus new components is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. The investigation identified that the specifications for overhauled compressor turbine blades were not as well defined as those for new blades, and that overhauled blades might fail to reach the stated inspection intervals, which is particularly important for operators of single-engine aircraft ("It is a safety issue that the specifications for compressor turbine blades that had been through a strip and recoat process were not as well defined as those for new blades" (4.2.5)). The decision to use overhauled components introduces new risks, and operators must make commercial decisions weighing these risks against the benefits ("An operator will usually make a commercial decision on whether to install new or overhauled turbine blades" (4.2.5)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the potential safety implications of using overhauled parts in aircraft maintenance.

Equipment and Preparedness for Water Emergencies
Equipment and preparedness for water emergencies is a safety theme related to this accident due to the fact that parachute drop pilots were not required to wear lifejackets or flotation devices if their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land. This downplayed the possibility of having to ditch an airplane or use the emergency parachute when over or near water ("Parachute drop pilots were not required to wear lifejackets or flotation devices if their flights were expected to remain within gliding distance of land" (4.4)). The operator did not require tandem masters to wear lifejackets, and the pilot was not equipped with a lifejacket, which was identified as a safety issue ("The operator did not equip its pilots with lifejackets and was not required to do so" (4.4.6)). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of being prepared for water emergencies, even when the likelihood seems low.

Registration and Compliance with Maintenance Programs
Registration and compliance with maintenance programs is a safety theme because the operator had maintained the engine in accordance with an approved alternative maintenance program, but the registration of the engine into that program had not been completed. Although this administrative oversight did not affect the reliability of the engine or contribute to the blade failure, it highlights the importance of proper registration and compliance with maintenance programs for ensuring the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft ("the operator had maintained the engine in accordance with an approved, alternative maintenance program, but the registration of the engine into that program had not been completed" (5.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it points to the potential risks associated with administrative lapses in the maintenance and oversight of aircraft components.
Themes for 2017_101: 
Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
Fatigue and alertness are critical human factors in transportation safety, particularly for operators of vehicles like train drivers. In this incident, the driver likely experienced microsleeps due to a combination of factors including mild obstructive sleep apnea, poor sleep quality prior to the shift, and being awake for over 10 hours during a night shift. These factors contributed to the driver not seeing the warning and compulsory stop boards, leading to an unauthorized entry into the worksite. "The reason for the driver not seeing the outer warning and compulsory stop boards was that the driver was likely experiencing microsleeps at the time" (5.2). "the driver was very likely susceptible to experiencing microsleeps due to a combination of the following factors: the driver suffered from mild obstructive sleep apnoea, which was affecting the quality of sleep; the driver had experienced a poor night's sleep before beginning the night shift, due to the hot ambient temperature; the driver had been awake for more than 10 hours and was nearing the end of a 10½-hour night shift" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).

Medical Assessment and Health Monitoring
The medical assessment and health monitoring of safety-critical workers are essential to ensure they are fit for duty. In this case, the driver's undetected mild obstructive sleep apnea was a contributing factor to the incident. The medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee completed the online medical questionnaire themselves, which could have led to an underestimation of the driver's sleepiness and risk of microsleeps. "The safety benefits derived from the KiwiRail safety-critical worker health assessment were not fully realised by those involved, and as a result the driver's sleep apnoea had gone undetected" (5.4). "In this case the driver reported that someone else had completed the online medical questionnaire part of the medical assessment for the driver, before the health assessment" (4.3.15).

Fatigue Risk Management Systems
A comprehensive fatigue risk management system is necessary to ensure that personnel perform at adequate levels of alertness. KiwiRail's draft fatigue risk management system policy was still under development at the time of the incident. A more mature system might have provided additional guidance to drivers to better evaluate their condition before attending shifts, potentially preventing the incident. "KiwiRail has a draft fatigue risk management system policy that is still under development. Had the current system been able to provide additional guidance to drivers, it may have helped them to evaluate their condition better before attending shifts" (5.5).

Technical Failures - eProtect System
Technical failures in safety systems can lead to incidents when they are relied upon as a defense against human error. The eProtect system on the locomotive failed to alert the driver or apply the train brakes automatically due to a hardware fault in the processing unit, which had been transmitting error messages for three weeks prior to the incident. This failure was not detected because the system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service. "The eProtect system was a safety defence for preventing trains inadvertently entering worksites without authorisation. The system did not work on this occasion because a technical error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected and rectified by KiwiRail staff" (5.6).

Safety System Monitoring and Response
Continuous monitoring and timely response to safety system alerts are crucial for preventing incidents. In this case, the eProtect system's error messages were not acted upon because the eProtect activity database was not actively monitored by KiwiRail for this type of occurrence. This oversight allowed the technical fault to persist and contributed to the incident. "The error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected because the eProtect system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service" (5.7).

Organizational Safety Culture
An organization's safety culture influences the effectiveness of safety measures and the likelihood of incidents. In this incident, the importance and safety benefits of the medical assessment program were not fully realized by those involved, indicating a potential gap in the safety culture at KiwiRail. Ensuring that employees understand and adhere to safety procedures is essential for preventing incidents. "It is an indication that the importance and safety benefits of the medical assessment programme were not fully realised by those involved" (4.3.15).
