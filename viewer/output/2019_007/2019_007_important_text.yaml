  \ power supply  systems in the Christchurch ATMC were designed  to be resilient\
  \ to \nequipment failure. This analysis examines  how the electrical power supply\
  \ system A for \nthe aeronautical t elecommunications network did not have the resilience\
  \ expected \nfrom the design  and, when it failed , how it disrupted the provision\
  \ of domestic air \ntraffic services.  \n3.2. The outage  to the Christchurch ATMC\
  \ aeronautical telecommunications network \nresulted in Airways ' sector controllers\
  \  not be ing able to provide normal air traffic \nservices  for the duration of\
  \ the outage.  \n3.3. The scope of this analysis is limited to the loss of air traffic\
  \ services  and to the \nassociated equi pment, personnel and procedures . Relevant\
  \ safety actions taken after  \nthe outage are also covered . \n3.4. The Commission\
  \ identified one safety issue related to maintenance checks of essential  \nequipment.\
  \  \nWhy the outage occur red \n3.5. The aeronautical telecommunications network\
  \ equipment had two independent \ngenerator -backed power supply systems, system\
  \ A and system B. The redundancy in \npower supply systems was so designed that\
  \ if one power supply system failed, the \nequipment would continue to operate from\
  \ the ot her power supply system.  \n3.6. The outage involved three significant\
  \ technical factors:  \n\u2022 the failure of a capacitor in UPS A  \n\u2022 a short\
  \ circuit that tripped  a circuit breaker , which  disconnected  UPS A as a power\
  \ \nsupply  \n\u2022 the incorrect power connection of the MPLS  network equipment\
  \ .  \n3.7. The initiating point  for the Airways outage was the failure of a capacitor\
  \  in the inverter \nof UPS A . The capacitor 's external casing was compromised\
  \  in the failure, allowing \ndebris from inside the capacitor to be spread over\
  \ surrounding circuit boards  (see \nFigure 3) and exposed copper terminals . This\
  \ debris was  very conductive and created a \nshort circuit inside the UPS cabinet.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 6 >>\n Final Report AO -2019- 007  \n3.8. These type of electrolytic\
  \ power capacitors  are under high electrical loads and Airways \ntechnicians were\
  \ aware that they are prone to occasional premature failure. Airways \nhad managed\
  \ this  risk by replacing the capacitors within  the manufacturer 's \nrecommended\
  \ reliable operating lifetime of  six years. The capacitor that failed had \nbeen\
  \ replaced 12 months before this outage .  \n3.9. The capacitor failure caused an\
  \  internal problem in UPS  A when the debris from the \ncapacitor exploded  within\
  \ the UPS. The UPS  detected the internal capacitor failure and \nswitched to the\
  \ reserve supply. However, the conductive debris from the capacitor \nfailure created\
  \ a short circuit inside the UPS.  \n3.10. The short circuit created an overload\
  \ on the reserve supply, which tripped the reserve circuit breaker at the main switchboard.\
  \ This removed all power to the UPS A \nconnected loads.   \n3.11. The essential\
  \ network equipment  (see appendix 1 ) was provided with dual internal \ndirect\
  \ current (DC) power supplies. These were intended to provide power supply redundancy\
  \ to the equipment and to be fed from two different external power supply \nsources\
  \ , systems A and B.  \n3.12. When power supply system A stopped providing power\
  \ to the aeronautical \ntelecommunications network equipment , power supply system\
  \ B should have taken \nover. However, both  power supply system connections  for\
  \ the MPLS equipment  were \nplugged into UPS  A electrical power outlet distribution\
  \  (EPOD)  (see Figure 4). The \ndashed  cable from EPOD A to MPLS B indicates the\
  \ incorrect power connection. The \ncorrect connection should have been from EPOD\
  \ B to MPLS  B, as shown in the diagram \nin appendix 1. \n3.13. Therefore, when\
  \ UPS A stopped providing power, the MPLS equipment  experienced a \ncomplete loss\
  \ of power and stopped functioning .  \n3.14. The MPLS network equipment is duplicated\
  \ in a separate cabinet to provide resilience \nand redundancy . That separate equipment\
  \ should have been operational and \nmaintained air traffic control services. However,\
  \ the incorrect connection was repeated \nin both cabinets,  so all the MPLS network\
  \ equipment lost power.  \n \nFigure 3: Failed capacitor from UPS  A \n \n \nFinal\
  \ Report AO -2019- 007 \n<< Page 7 >>\n   \nFigure 4: MPLS and IPMux  incorrect\
  \ power connection schematic  \n \n3.15. The power loss to the MPLS  equipment \
  \ in Christchurch caused a degradation to the \nsurveillance information presented\
  \ to domestic air traffic controllers and a loss of their \nprimary voice communications\
  \ systems.  \n3.16. A second incorrect cabling issue was detected with the network\
  \ equipment, although \nthis cabling error did not contribute to the outage. Both\
  \ power supply system \nconnections for the IPMux equipment were plugged into UPS\
  \ B EPOD (see Figure 4). \nThe dashed cable from EPOD B to IPMux  A indicates the\
  \ incorrect power connection. \nThe correct connection should have been from EP\
  \ OD A to IPMux A , as shown in the \ndiagram in a ppendix 1.  \n3.17. The MPLS\
  \ and IPMux  incorrect power  connections had likely  existed since installation\
  \ , \nbefore the network outage in 2015.  \n3.18. At the time of the outage in 2015,\
  \ Airways used black cables for all UPS power supply \nsystem connections. In 2018\
  \ they  introduced a new cabling standard that ensured UPS \npower cables were colour\
  \ coded  for UPS A and UPS B. The IPMux cabinets  involved \nwith this incident\
  \ at the Christchurch ATMC had not been brought up to this standard \nbecause they\
  \ would become redundant after Airways relocated operations in 2023 \nfrom the Andy\
  \ Heard Building to the new ATMC being built nearby . \n \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final\
  \ Report AO -2019- 007 Essential equipment  resilience  \nSafety issue:  Airways\
  \ did not conduct m aintenance checks of essential equipment  to ensure it  \nwas\
  \ resilien t to a power supply failure.   \n3.19. Airways  intended to conduct a\
  \ nnual UPS power outage checks to ensure that all \nessential equipment had a dual\
  \ power supply from system s A and B.  \n3.20. The Commission  found  Airways had\
  \ not conducted the required maintenance checks \non their  aeronautical telecommunications\
  \  network equipment in accordance with their \npreventative maintenance action\
  \ procedures.  \n3.21. Airways had conducted significant work on the network equipment\
  \ cabinets  before the \n2015 outage. Airways ' technicians had predicted that incorrect\
  \ power connections \ncould exist and defined a maintenance checking procedure in\
  \ 2018 (UPS power outage \nchecks).  \n3.22. Airways ' management deferred  the\
  \ UPS power outage checks  in 2018 and 2019. At the \ntime they believed  that there\
  \ was a greater risk of an outage to air traffic services from \nconduct ing the\
  \ UPS power outage checks than not.  \n3.23. If Airways had conducted the UPS power\
  \ outage checks, it would have exposed the incorrect power connection issue with\
  \ the MPLS and IPMux network equipment. This \nwould have provided the opportunity\
  \ for Airways to co rrect the power connection \nissue s, thereby preventing the\
  \ 2019 outage.    \n \n \nFinal Report AO -2019- 007 \n<< Page 9 >>"
