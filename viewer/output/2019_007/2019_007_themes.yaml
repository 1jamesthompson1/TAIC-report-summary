- name: Redundancy in Power Supply Systems
  explanation: Redundancy in power supply systems is a safety theme that involves having multiple independent systems to ensure continuous operation in the event of a failure. This theme is relevant to the accident because the aeronautical telecommunications network equipment at Christchurch ATMC was designed with two independent generator-backed power supply systems, system A and system B, to provide resilience. However, the failure of a capacitor in UPS A and the incorrect power connection of the MPLS network equipment resulted in a complete loss of power when it should have been supported by the redundant system B ("The redundancy in power supply systems was so designed that if one power supply system failed, the equipment would continue to operate from the other power supply system" (3.5), "When power supply system A stopped providing power to the aeronautical telecommunications network equipment, power supply system B should have taken over" (3.12)).
- name: Maintenance Checks and Procedures
  explanation: Maintenance checks and procedures are critical for ensuring the continued safety and reliability of equipment. This theme is relevant to the accident as the Commission identified a safety issue related to the lack of maintenance checks of essential equipment at Christchurch ATMC. Airways had intended to conduct annual UPS power outage checks but did not perform them as required, which would have likely exposed the incorrect power connection issue and prevented the outage ("The Commission identified one safety issue related to maintenance checks of essential equipment" (3.4), "Airways had not conducted the required maintenance checks on their aeronautical telecommunications network equipment in accordance with their preventative maintenance action procedures" (3.20)).
- name: Risk Management and Mitigation
  explanation: Risk management and mitigation involve identifying potential risks and implementing measures to prevent or minimize their impact. This theme is relevant to the accident because Airways technicians were aware that the type of capacitors used were prone to failure and had a procedure to replace them within the manufacturer's recommended lifetime. Despite this, a failure still occurred, and the risk was not adequately mitigated due to incorrect power connections that had not been identified or corrected ("Airways technicians were aware that they are prone to occasional premature failure" (3.8), "If Airways had conducted the UPS power outage checks, it would have exposed the incorrect power connection issue" (3.23)).
- name: Equipment Installation and Configuration
  explanation: Proper equipment installation and configuration are essential to ensure that systems function as intended, especially in safety-critical environments. This theme is relevant to the accident as the MPLS and IPMux network equipment were incorrectly connected to the power supply systems since installation, which contributed to the failure of the redundant power supply system during the outage ("both power supply system connections for the MPLS equipment were plugged into UPS A electrical power outlet distribution" (3.12), "The incorrect power connections to the MPLS and IPMux network equipment had likely existed since installation" (4.4)).
- name: Organizational Oversight and Compliance
  explanation: Organizational oversight and compliance with established procedures and standards are crucial for maintaining safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because Airways' management deferred the UPS power outage checks in 2018 and 2019, believing that conducting the checks posed a greater risk than not performing them. This decision went against their own preventative maintenance procedures and ultimately led to the outage not being prevented ("Airways' management deferred the UPS power outage checks in 2018 and 2019" (3.22), "Airways had not carried out the required preventative maintenance power outage checks" (4.5)).
- name: Technological Upgrades and Standards
  explanation: Implementing technological upgrades and adhering to current standards is a safety theme that ensures systems are up-to-date and capable of meeting operational demands. This theme is relevant to the accident because, in 2018, Airways introduced a new cabling standard that used color-coded cables for UPS A and UPS B to prevent confusion. However, the IPMux cabinets involved in the incident had not been updated to this standard, contributing to the incorrect power connections ("in 2018 they introduced a new cabling standard that ensured ups power cables were color coded for ups a and ups b" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The IPMux cabinets involved with this incident at the Christchurch ATMC had not been brought up to this standard" (3.18)).
