","0.0","1.667","The document does not indicate that the accident was caused by human error or assumptions made by the crew or maintenance personnel.
","2.887","26.667","The accident was significantly influenced by the lack of adequate training and competency. The report states that ""The training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension procedure did not include key information provided by Bombardier concerning the release handle forces, and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure"" (5.6). Additionally, pilots were not familiar with the actual force required to release the uplock during the alternate landing gear extension procedure (4.13, 4.18).
","5.774","30.0","The accident was also influenced by the pilots' lack of familiarity with the equipment, specifically the force required to release the landing gear uplocks manually. The report indicates that ""the simulator did not accurately simulate or differentiate the forces required in the aeroplane"" (4.21), and ""had the simulator more closely represented the actual forces required, it is likely that the first officer would have succeeded with the procedure and that the occurrence would have been avoided"" (4.23).
","0.0","3.333","While CRM was not a direct cause of the accident, there were opportunities for more effective communication between the pilots, and between them and other airline staff, which could have potentially influenced the outcome (4.35-4.37).
","2.887","8.333","The report suggests that there were minor errors made in reading the QRH procedures, which did not contribute to the accident, but highlights the importance of adherence to safety procedures (4.27-4.29, 5.8).
","2.887","3.333","The organizational safety culture at Air Nelson may have contributed to the accident, as the report indicates that the airline's training and simulator did not accurately represent the forces required for the alternate landing gear extension, which is a reflection of the organization's approach to safety and training (4.13, 4.21, 4.23).
","5.774","8.333","The report highlights that the Minimum Equipment List provision that allowed a flight to commence without an operative nosewheel steering system was based on operational considerations only and did not consider the possibility of a related system failure (5.3). This indicates a lack of thorough risk management and analysis.

","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the accident.
","0.0","8.333","The faulty inhibit switch, which was a maintenance issue, was the initial cause of the accident, as it led to the loss of nosewheel steering and the failure of the landing gear to extend normally (5.1, 5.2).
