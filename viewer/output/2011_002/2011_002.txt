The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken  for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.  
 
These report s may be reprinted in whole or in part without charge, providing acknowledgement is made

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 9 February 2011 a Bombardier DHC -8-311 aeroplane (known as a "Q300 ") operated by Air 
Nelson Limited departed from Hamilton Aerodrome on a scheduled flight to Wellington 
Aerodrome.  On board were 2 pilots, a flight attendant and 41 passengers . 
1.2. Prior to t aking off from Hamilton, the nosewheel steering malfunctioned because an "inhibit 
switch " in the cockpit was faulty.  The faulty switch caused a loss of hydraulic pressure to the 
nosewheel steering .  The nosewheel steering system was considered non -essenti al, so in 
accordance with the approved Minimum Equipment List, the aeroplane departed Hamilton 
with the system inoperative.  The trip towards Wellington was uneventful . 
1.3. The nosewheel steering hydraulic power came from the extend side of  the landing gear  
hydraulic system .  On the approach to Wellington, none of the landing gear extended when it 
was selected down.  The pilots carried out a go -around to give them time to perform the 
relevant procedures  provided in a Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) .  The Q300 was fitted 
with an alternative system for lowering the landing gear when the normal system failed.  The 
"Alternate Gear Extension " procedure succeeded in getting the main landing gear to extend , 
but not the nose landing gear.2  That remained locke d in its retracted position . 
1.4. There was nothing mechanically wrong with the alternate landing gear extension system.  The 
nose  landing gear  did not extend because the pilots did not pull hard enough on the handle 
that s hould have released  the uplock .  If the uplock had released,  the nose  landing gear would 
have lower ed under gravity and lock ed down . 
1.5. The pilots decided to divert to Woodbourne Aerodrome and to land with the nose landing gear 
retracted.  No -one was injured in the landing.  The damage to the aeroplane was confined to 
the area around the nose landing gear and the lower forward fuselage.  
1.6. The Minimum Equipment List appeared to have considered the operational consequences 
only of allowing a Q300 to depart with inoperative nosewheel steering.  The link between a 
failure of the nosewheel s teering  and a potential failure in the hydraulic system, which would 
affect  the landing gear , did not appear to have been considered .  The manufacturer has since 
amend ed the Minimum Equipment List to  requir e a check of the hydraulic system pressure 
before allowing a depart ure with the nosewheel steering  inoperative . 
1.7. The operator's pilots were not made aware through their training o f how hard one had to pull 
the handle to release the nose  landing gear  uplock.  A much lesser pull was required when 
practi sing the procedure in the operator's flight simulator  and the Alternate Gear Extension 
procedure did not , at the time,  give any guidance  as to the force required . 
1.8. Air Nelson  modified its flight simulator so that the forces were more typical of t hose found on 
the actual aeroplane , and provided its pilots with  more technical information on the Alternate 
Gear Extension procedure.  The aeroplane manufacturer provided all operators of the Q300 
with a more comprehensive  description of the Alternate Gear Extension procedure and 
provided options for pilots to consider should the procedure be unsuccessful.  
1.9. A recommendation  was made to the Director of Civil Aviation t hat he liaise with Transport 
Canada t o make other  National Aviation Authorities  aware of this incident and of the 
desirability of flight simulato rs closely representing the actual forces required for a n alternate  
landing gear extension.  
1.10.  Although not contributory to the accident, the report discusses the design of checklists and 
how they can lead to pilots making errors or missing important items d uring times of high 
workload.  The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) had 
commented on this issue in a previous inquiry.  A recommendation  was made to the Director 
of Civil Aviation regarding the format of QRHs . 
                                                        
2 Although 'alternative' is the more correct word , the industry -accepted 'alternate' is used in this report.   

<< Page 2 >>
 Report 11 -002 1.11.  The Commission mad e findings  about the cause of the nosewheel steering and landing gear 
extension failures , about crew training in alternative procedures , and the importance of having 
well designed QRHs.  
1.12.  The Commission also identified the following key lessons : 
 in their simulator training pilots should be taught how to perform emergency and non -
normal procedures as robus tly and rigorous ly as if the procedures were being performed 
on the actual aircraft  
 pilots should be informed of flight simulat or characteristics that differ from those in the 
aircraft to ensure that  pilots are not mi sled during actual flight operations  
 QRHs should be designed to minimise the potential for error as they are used by pilots  
during times of high workload  and, potentially,  high stress  when dealing with 
emergencies .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 9 February 2011  Air Nelson Limited (the operator) advised the Commission of the accident 
soon  after it ha d ha ppened .  The Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand notified the 
Commission very soon afterwards in accordance with section 27 of the Civil Aviation Act 1990 .  
Although t he circumstances appeared similar to those of an incident then  under investigation 
by the Commission (inquiry 10 -010), a separate inquiry was opened under section  12 of the 
Transport Accident Investigation  Commission  Act 1990 . 
2.2. The Commission  gave permission for the aeroplane to be remove d from the runway before the 
investigator  in charge  arrived on site early the next day .  Following an initial examination of the 
aeroplane, the inquiry shifted to the operator's maintenance and operational base at Nelson 
Aerodrome.  The aeroplane was flown  to Nelson on 10 February 2011 for troubleshooting of 
the defect and repair of the dama ge. 
2.3. A field service representative of Bombardier Aerospace, the manufacturer , was based at 
Nelson  at the time and provided assistance t hroughout  the inquiry.  
2.4. On 10 February 2011  the Transportation Safety Board of Canada , the State of Manufacture,  
appointed  an Accredited Representative in accordance with section 5.18 of Annex 13 to the 
International Convention on Civil Aviation (Annex 13).  The Accredited Representative  assisted 
the Commission by supervising the examination of landing gear system components that had 
been  returned under quarantine to the aeroplane manufacturer.  Specialist examination s of 
the components w ere conducted at the facilities of the component manufacturers in Canada.  
2.5. On 15 February 2011  the cockpit voice recorder was taken to the Aus tralian Transport Safety 
Bureau laboratory in Canberra for d ownload.  The Bureau appointed an Accredited 
Representative to assist the Commission, as provided for in section 5.23 of Annex 13.  The 
downloaded information was protected in accordance with Aust ralian legislation .3  The 2 pilots 
assisted with the transcript of the record ing.  A further cockpit recording, taken during an 
alternate landing gear extension in another Q300, was analysed by the Bureau t o help 
determin e whether the nose landing gear  uplock  had released on the accident flight . 
2.6. On 14 March 2011  the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States appointed 
an Accredited Representative , as provided for in section 5.23 of Annex 13,  who arranged the 
supervision of a specialist exa mination of components at the manufacturers' facilities in the 
United States.  This was a consequence of  United States legislation.4 
2.7. The following processes also took place during the inquiry:  
 interviews of the crew members and discu ssions with operational and maintenance 
personnel from Air Nelson  
 analysis of the recorded flight data  
 examination of the  landing gear operation on other Q300 aeroplanes  
 discussions and correspondence with the aeroplane and component  manufacturers' 
repre sentatives  
 discussions with representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority  
 reviews of the safety occurrence databases in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and 
the United Kingdom for relevant occurrences . 
2.8. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the Natio nal Transportation Safety Board . 
2.9. On 29 August 2012  the Commission approved the draft report for circulation to Interested 
Persons for comment.   Submissions were rece ived from the  2 pilots, Air Nelson, Bombardier 
Aerospace, the Civil Aviation Authority  and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau .  The 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada had no comment.  Neither did Transp ort Canada

 3. Factual information  
3.1. History of the flight  
3.1.1.  The aeroplane involved in this accident was a Bombardier DHC -8-311 aeroplane , known as a 
Q300.  It was registered ZK -NEQ and operated by Air Nelson.  At 1235 o n 9 February 2011  the 
aeroplane taxied for depart ure from Hamilton Aerodrome on a scheduled air transport flight to 
Wellington  Aerodrome .  On board were 2 pilots, one flight attendant  and 41 passengers.  
3.1.2.  While taxiing for departure , the nosewheel  steering did not respond to the captain's  hand  
control  and t he NOSE STEERING  caution light illuminated.   The captain centred the hand 
control and cycled the system switch off then back on, which initially extinguished the light, 
but the fault remained .  The pilots then confirmed that they had carried out the actions 
required by the operator's QRH  (see Appendix).  
3.1.3.  They also referred to the Minimum Equipment List5 and confirmed that further flight was  
permitted with the steering system inoperative.  The Minimum Equipme nt List  included an 
operational limit of 20 knots of crosswind for take -off and landing, which could be met on that 
sector, and a maintenance requirement to remove the electrical power for the steering 
system, which the  pilots did by pulling the appropriate  circuit breakers . 
3.1.4.  The pilots considered that the defect was minor and would be attended to by an engineer after 
they arrived at Wellington.  Therefore they did not inform the Air Nelson  maintenance control 
centre  of the defect before taking off .  Before commencing the approach to Wellington , the 
captain noted that the crosswind was below 20 knots , and the first officer radioed the Air 
Nelson o perations o ffice at Wellington  with a request for a  terminal  gate that would not 
require tight  turns whi le taxiing.6 
3.1.5.  On the approach  to Wellington , when the landing gear selector lever was moved to DOWN , the 
landing gear system did not respond .  It was later determined that a  faulty Landing Gear Down 
Select Inhibit Switch  (inhibit switch) , which blocked  hydraulic pressure to the down (extend)  
side of the landing gear system, had caused th is failure and the earlier steering defect at 
Hamilton . 
3.1.6.  The captain commenced  a go-around  and, not knowing the cause  of the landing gear problem,  
instructed the first officer to leave the selector lever in the down  position .  The pilots  advised 
air traffic control that they had a landing gear problem and flew clear of the aerodrome in 
order to carry out  the QRH  "Landing gear fails to extend " procedu re (see Appendix ). 
3.1.7.  The first steps in this procedure were to ensure that the flight deck controls were correctly 
configured for normal extension of the landing gear, including that the inhibit switch was in the 
guarded NORMAL position, which it was.  
3.1.8.  The alternate release  door, referred to in the checklist, is a flap in the flight deck ceiling above 
the first officer's seat (see Figure 1) and the alternate extension  door is a flap in the flight 
deck floor (see Figure 2).  
                                                        
5 The Minimum Equipment List is a manual that l ists those items that may be inoperative for flight and any operational or 
maintenance conditions to be met before commencing a flight with a specific item inoperative .  The manual can be 
referred to and its provisions applied at any time before take -off. 
6 Communications between the crew members  and air traffic control , and flight deck sounds, were obtained from the 
cockpit voice recorder .

 3.1.9.  The first officer misread part of the "Landing gear fails to extend " checklist , as shown in the 
comparison between the QRH and the cockpit voice recording below (item 3 in the excerpt ; 
emphasis added):

means that that gear leg is down and 
locked  [Not read out. ] 
8 Is at least one green light illuminated for 
each Gear Leg position? - YES/NO  Is at least one green light illuminated? No.  
 
3.1.10.  With the landing gear still not extended, the checklist directed the pilots to carry out the 
Alternate Gear Extension procedure ( see Appendix).  Before doing this, th e captain infor med 
the passengers of the situation.  
3.1.11.  The Alternate Gear E xtension procedure checklist was headed:  
 
 
 
When the first officer pulled the main landing gear uplock  release handle in the ceiling, the 
main landing gear extended and locked down.  After he pulled the nose landing gear uplock 
release handle in the floor  (see Figure 2), the nose landing gear doors opened  almost 
immediately , but  the pilots did not hear the  sound of the gear leg locking down .  The first 
officer checked the downlock verification lights , which showed  that the left and right main 
landing gear  legs only w ere down.  
3.1.12.  The first officer then quickly read through the QRH considerations for landing wi th the nose 
landing gear not extended  (see Appendix).  He misread the item "If the nose landing gear  is 
not extended …" as "If the nose landing gear  is not retracted… ", and misidentified the line 
"Continued on next page " as a part of th is checklist .  Althou gh t hese errors were 
inconsequential  in this case , their relevance to QRH design and use is discussed in the 
Analysis section of this report . 
3.1.13.  The captain con sidered diverting to another  aerodrome  - either Palmerston  North, the 
planned alternate, or Woodbourne - rather than obstruct  the busy Wellington runway by 
landing without t he nose landing gear  extend ed.  The Woodbourne weather was fine with a 
southeast crosswind of about  12 knots  at the time , good visibility and  the lowest cloud at 
2000 feet.  WARNING  
Landing gear will not retract following this procedure  
 

<< Page 8 >>
 Report 11 -002 3.1.14.  The Wellington controller then advised that the nose landing gear doors appeared to be open , 
but the gear leg was not extended fully .  At about this time, the first officer, apparently without 
direction from the captain , gave the nose landing gear  uplock release handle another pull.  He 
described it as "an easy pull to the stop ", with the handle coming up to a height about level 
with the top of the centre instrument console .  However, the uplock still did not release.  
3.1.15.  After 17 minutes ' holding in the Wellington area , the pilots  advised the controller that they 
would divert to Woodbourne for an emergency landing and they requested that emergency 
services  attend .   
3.1.16.  En route, the captain briefed the flight attendant  and instruct ed her to prepare the cabin for 
an emergency landing .  He indicated that they would land in about 15 minutes.   Six minutes 
later, he made a further announcement to inform the passengers .  The pilots completed most 
of the Q RH items  for a landing wit h the nose landing gear  not extended , apart from some 
items that they completed shortly before the final approach at Woodbourne . 
3.1.17.  The pilots decided that another visual check of the landing gear position by the Woodbourne 
control ler was not required .  Photo graphs taken from the ground at Woodbourne showed that 
the nose landing gear forward doors were open , but the gear leg was not extended.  
3.1.18.  Air Nelson had been alerted to the problem by the Wellington controller.  When the aeroplane 
arrived at Woodbourne , the pilots were asked to hold while Air Nelson technical and 
operational staff considered t he defect and whether a normal landing could be achieved.  
Their questions were passed by  telephone to the Woodbourne air traffic control ler, who 
relayed them to the  pilots .  ZK -NEQ was the only aircraft in the Woodbourne control zone 
during the 20 minutes these exchanges  took place.  
3.1.19.  While in the holding  pattern , the pilots a sked the controller to pass to the Air Nelson staff 2 
sets of information concerning  the nosew heel steering defect at Hamilton .  The staff did not 
recall receiving that information.  The controller passed to the pilots  a report that the  nose 
landing gear  front left door appeared to be partially open , and a request from the engineers 
for the pilots to make a low pass so that a ground observer could attempt to confirm the nose 
landing gear  position .  Following the low pass, the pilots considered that they had enough fuel 
for another circuit before t hey should land.  
3.1.20.  The pilots asked what had been observed during the low pass , but no feedback was given .  
The controller passed on an Air Nelson  suggest ion that there could be dirt in the hydraulic 
lines that might shift if the pilots cycled the landing gear.  However , the pilots opt ed not to do 
so because th ey had no procedure  for reversing the Alternate Gear Extension procedure  and 
there was doubt about the door positions .  The pilots  then informed the flight attendant and 
passengers that they were about to make the final approach t o land , but 4 minutes later the 
controller relayed a further "strong recommendation " from the engineers  to cycle the landing 
gear.  Again, the pilots declined to do so . 
3.1.21.  The checklist for landing without the nose landing gear extended called for the cabin 
announcement "Attention! Attention! Brace  for impact !" to be made wh en the aeroplane was 
500 feet above the ground, which would normally be about 50 seconds before  touchdown.  In 
this case, the announcement was made much earlier  in order to complete  the checklist , apart 
from selecting the final landing flap .  As a result, the flight attendant began yelling the 
command "Head down ! Stay down! " to the passengers  early , and continued doing so until the 
aeroplane touched down  more than 2 minutes  later . 
3.1.22.  At about 1440 the aeroplane landed  and the captain lowered the nose until the nose landing 
gear doors contacted the runway.  The doors collapsed before the aeroplane came to a stop 
on the centreline.  The pilots shut down the engines, turned off the  electrical power and 
ordered a precautionary evacuation of the aeroplane.  No -one was injured  and there was no 
fire. 
3.1.23.  Damage was confined to the nose landing gear doors and surrounding structure, and 3 
antennae on the lower fuselage (see Figure 3).

Damage to ZK -NEQ 
3.2. Aircraft information  
3.2.1.  The Q300 is a Bombardier Aerospace development of the de Havilland Canada "Dash 8 " 
series of aeroplanes .  It is a high -wing, pressurised aeroplane powered by 2 turbo -prop 
engines.  The aero plane, as  configured by Air Nelson , had  a crew of 2 pilots and one flight 
attendant and 50 passenger  seats.  The type certification authority for the Q300 is Transport 
Canada . 
3.2.2.  Air Nelson  had a fleet of 23 Q300 aeroplanes that had entered service between Ju ly 2005 
and June 2009.  ZK-NEQ had been  manufactured in March 2007 and entered service with Air 
Nelson  that month .  At the time of the accident, it had accrued 8791  flight hours and 10 508 
cycles .7 
3.2.3.  According to Air Nelson 's records, the aeroplane had been maintained in accordance with the 
approved maintenance programme.  The previous scheduled maintenance had been a 7-day 
line check completed on 2 February 2011.  
3.2.4.  No nose steering  defect had been reported on ZK -NEQ since the aeroplane  entered service 
and no relevant landing gear defect had been logged on the aeroplane during the 14 months 
prior to the incident.  On 9 February 2011 there were 3 deferred maintenance items in the 
aeroplane  maintenance log , but none  was relevant to this occurrence . 
Hydraulic sys tem 
3.2.5.  Hydraulic power to operate various items  on the aeroplane is provided by 2 independent 
systems.  The No.2 hydraulic system is pressurised by a pump driven by the right engine and 
powers the landing gear and nosewheel st eering.   Filters in the pressure and return lines 
remove foreign debris  from the hydraulic oil .  The oil is usually analysed at least once a year .

 Report 11 -002 Landing gear description  and operation  
3.2.6.  The Q300 has a retractable, tricycle landing gear.  The nose landing gear retracts forward into 
the fuselage nose.  Figure 4 shows some of the nose landing gear  components referred to in 
this report.   
3.2.7.  The landing gear operation is controlled by moving the cockpit landing gear selector lever to 
the UP or DOWN position.  This sends an electrical signal to the appropriate solenoid in the 
landing gear selector valve  to allow the corresponding landing gear hydraulic lines to be 
pressurised .  The extend solenoid of the selector valve remains energised  when  the landing 
gear is dow n to allow hydraulic pressure to the nosewheel steering.8  When the landing gear is 
selected UP, t he extend solenoid de-energises, removing hydraulic  pressure from the extend 
lines . 
3.2.8.  The nose landing gear is enclosed by 2 sets of doors when retracted.  The forward doors are 
operated hydraulically and the rear doors are mechanically linked to the landing gear leg.  
When the selector lever is moved to DOWN, hydraulic pressure is applied simultaneously to:  
 the door actuator, to open the forward doors  
 the drag s trut actuator, to release the uplock  
 the nose landing gear extend/retract actuator.  
3.2.9.  Sequence valves ensure that the components move in the correct order and delay the nose 
landing gear actuator operation to allow time for the forward doors to open fully before the 
landing gear leg extends.  Once the nose landing gear is locked down, the forward doors close.  
A "Land ing Gear INOP " caution light illuminates if any of the landing gear legs and their 
hydraulically operated doors move out of sequence.  
3.2.10.  A 2-position (NORMAL and INHIBIT) inhibit switch is located beside the alternate release door 
in the flight deck ceiling (see Figure 1).9  The switch is used in the "Landing Gear INOP " 
procedure to prevent landing gear extension when a door might be closed or closing, and it 
can also be used to simulate a landing gear failure condition.  
3.2.11.  If the switch i s put to INHIBIT while the landing gear is retracted, the extend solenoid of the 
landing gear selector valve cannot  energise .  Therefore, no landing gear legs will extend when  
the landing gear selector lever is next moved to DOWN.  
3.2.12.  If the switch is put to INHIBIT wh ile the landin g gear is extended, the extend  solenoid will de -
energise and hydraulic pressure will be removed from the landing gear system, including the 
nosewheel steering .  However , the landing gear remains in the extended position because of 
the mechanical over-centr e downlocks .  The position of the switch does not affect l anding gear  
retraction . 
Alternate landing gear extension  
3.2.13.  The alternate landing gear extension controls include:  
 the main landing gear uplock release handle, behind the alternate release door in the 
flight deck ceiling above the right -hand pilot's seat (see Figure 1)  
 the nose landing gear uplock release handle under the alternate extension  door in the 
floor by the right -hand pilot's seat (see Figure 2).

Figure 4 
Q300 nose landing gear  
3.2.14.  The action of opening the overhead alternate release door  connects the pressure and return 
lines of the landing gear hydraulic system , thereby bypassing the actuators . 
3.2.15.  When the nose landing gear uplock release handle  in the floor is pulled, the attached cable 
releases the forward door lock followed by r elease  of the uploc k.  The nose landing gear leg 
should then lower freely  under gravity , with t he airflow assis ting it to lock down . 
3.2.16.  A very light force is required to release the door locks, because their opening is facilitated by a 
spring.  There are no mechanical restrictions, such as a detent , in the sequence for a n 
alternate  landing gear release, but the much higher force required to release the uplock, 
compared with that to open the doors, is perceived , and was described,  as a detent.   The Air 
Nelson Q300 System s Training Manual stated:10

 Report 11 -002 [The] uplock release handles are detented.  Pulling to the first detent releases 
the door uplocks and pulling the rest of the way releases the gear uplocks.  The 
first detent is to facilitate opening the gear doors for ground servicing.  During 
an alternate extension, the handles should be pulled as far as they will go in 
one motion . 
3.2.17.  The Bombardier Q300 Maintenance Manual also referred to a detent when pulling the handle 
to open the doors in order to perform maintenance on part  of the nose landing gear.11 
3.2.18.  The nose landing gear retraction actuator will not extend freely  until the forward doors have 
opened completely and the locking mechanism has been  fully released .  If the pull on the 
release handle is relaxed while the doors are in the process of  opening and before the locking 
mechanism  has released, spring tension in the locking mechanism can re-engage the lock .  
This possibility was not widely known among pilots at the time  of the accident . 
3.2.19.  The nose landing g ear uplock release handle is operated p rior to an aeroplane's first flight 
each day .  A pull of approximately 6 to 8 kilograms (kg) is required on the handle to open  the 
nose landing gear  forward doors  so that pilots  can inspect the inside of the wheel well. 
Training in alternate landing gear extension procedure  
3.2.20.  Procedures such as the Alternate Gear Extension  were once p ermitted to be p ractised during  
air transport flights, which ensured that pilots were aware of the actual force s needed  to 
release the u plock s, but  training for such  non-normal  procedure s now has to be performed  in 
a flight simulator.12  In this case the 2  pilots had not performed an alternate landing gear 
extension in the aeroplane.  
3.2.21.  The pilot in the right seat usually performs the procedure, including pulling the uplock release 
handle, but all of the Air Nelson  pilots had practised the procedure in flight simulator s during 
their aeroplane type rating course s.  Thereafter, it was p ractised when t he recurrent t raining 
programme  for pi lots included a scenario with that requirement , which was nominally every 18 
months . 
3.2.22.  The captain and the first officer had completed their  Q300 ground training course s with Air 
Nelson staff, and their simulator  training had been  conducted by a certificated  training 
organisation.  The organisation  advised that it had stressed to trainees that when pulling the 
release handle the door lock would be felt to have release d but the pull had to be continued 
as hard as possible until the green position advisory light illuminated .  The green light  
indicate d that th e nose landing gear had locked down .  If the procedure was not successful, it 
could be repeated, using both hands on the handle.   Air Nelson said that its ground course at 
the time did not address  the Bo mbardier advice to pull the handle to the stops and to repeat 
the action if necessary until the landing gear was  down and locked.  
3.2.23.  In 1997 Bombardier published a Safety of Flight Supplement that noted that the pull forces 
required during an alternate landing g ear extension "may exceed those experienced during 
practice extensions, particularly those experienced in flight simulators ".13  That statement was 
included in the Bombardier flight manual.  While Air Nelson said that it s practice was to  assess  
Safety of Flight Supplement s and to incorporate relevant material into manuals and training  
courses , it acknowledged that the information in the Safety of Flight Supplement concerning 
the alternate landing gear extension  procedure had not been included in  the ground training 
course notes provided to the 2 pilots  involved in this accident , nor had it been incorporated 
into company manuals  at the time .

Report 11 -002 
<< Page 13 >>
 3.2.24.  In late 1997  the Commission published a report on a Dash 8 accident  that had occurred in 
1995 ("the 1995 accident ") while the pilots were performing an alternate extension of the 
main landing gear.14  The report noted that the involved airline  (Ansett New Zealand, which  
ceased operations in 2001 and had no connect ion with Air Nelson) had not include d any 
refer ence to the required pull force in its QRH  (Transport Accident Investigation Commission, 
1997, p.86) . 
3.2.25.  At the time of the ZK -NEQ accident in February 2011, the  Air Nelson QRH Alternate Gear 
Extension procedure stated that the uplock release handle should be  "pull[ed] fully up ", but 
did not give a  force required, nor state that the handle had to be pulled as hard and held for 
as long as it took to release the uplock.  Th e QRH s of both Air Nelson and Bombardier were 
subsequently  amended to draw attention to the forces required . 
Nosewheel steering  
3.2.26.  The nosewheel steer ing system is electrically controlled and hydraulically operated, using a 
hand control next to the left -hand  pilot's seat or by moving the rudder pedals.  The hydraulic 
pressure comes from the DOWN , or extend,  side of the landing gear selector valve . 
3.2.27.  A fault in the electronic control unit is indicated  by the NOSE STEERING caution light.  In that 
case or if the s ystem is switched off, the steering actuator is depressurised and th e nose wheel 
castor s freely.  The aeroplane can then be steered using differential brak es and power . 
Flight recorders  
3.2.28.  The aeroplane was fitted with a Honeywell flight data recorder , but parameters  relat ing 
specifically to the nosewheel steering or to the alternate extension of the landing gear were  
not recorded .  
3.2.29.  The aeroplane was also fitted with a Honeywell cockpit voice recorder with a 2 -hour recording 
duration.  Radio transmissions, intercom and cabin announcements, and cockpit area 
ambient sounds were recorded  on the cockpit voice recorder .  The recorder  was taken to the 
Australian Transport Safety Bureau laboratory in Canberra where the audio recording was 
downloaded  and examined .  The separate audio tracks that recorded the last 30 minutes of 
the captain's and the  first officer's intercom and radio transmissions were of good quality  and 
included the landing at Woodbourne .  The combined 2 -hour track was also of good sound 
quality, but after commencing with a short segment (about 90 seconds) on the ground at 
Hamilton  it skipped to  the climb after departing Hamil ton.  The remainder of the flight  was 
recorded continuously on the combined track .15  The 2 pilots later assisted the Commission to 
prepare  a transcri pt of  the recording.  
3.2.30.  The sound of the nose landing gear  uplock releas ing on the recording might  have been 
present on the recording and obscured by a radio call made to the Wellington controller  at the 
same time  as the release handle was pulled .  The recording was compared with another made 
on a  different Q300 in an attempt  to isolate the "signature " of the uplock releas ing.  This 
confirmed that the sound of the nose landing gear  uplock releas ing was not recorde d during 
the alternate extension procedure carried out at Wellington .

 Report 11 -002 3.3. Tests and research  
Initial tests  
3.3.1.  After the accident , the doors  in the flight deck that cover ed the uplock release handles  for the 
main and nose landing gear were found open.  The aeroplane nose was lifted off the runway 
with a crane. The nose landing gear  was found in the uplock , but it extended under its own 
weight when the uplock release handle was pulled . 
3.3.2.  On 10 February 2011, after taking the required  engineering action and obtaining regulatory 
approval , the aeroplane was flown to the Air Nelson base at Nelson Aerodrome with t he 
landing gear locked down and the forward nose landing gear  doors removed . 
3.3.3.  Initial test s found no anomalies in the electrical circuits from the landing gear selector handle 
to the landing gear selector valve solenoids.  
Failure of all landing gear to extend by the  normal system  
3.3.4.  The landing gear selector valve and hydraulic sequencing valve were examined at the 
premises of the manufacturer, Eaton Aerospace, under the supervision of an investigator of 
the United States National Transportation Saf ety Board on behalf of the Commission.  Both 
components passed all functional tests.  
3.3.5.  During functional testing of the landing gear after the aeroplane had been repaired , an 
intermittent fault was found with the inhibit switch .  The landing gear did not ext end when it 
was selected DOWN with the switch in t he NORMAL position , but correct operation could be 
obtained by bumping the switch.  
3.3.6.  The connection between the nosewheel steering defect at Hamilton and the landing gear not 
extending by the normal system at  Wellington was then apparent .  After the inhibit switch was 
replaced, all functional checks, including those of the nosewheel steering, were satisfactory.   A 
check of Air Nelson 's Q300 fleet did not find any more defective inhibit switches.  
3.3.7.  Switches with the same part number were used on the Q300 flight deck for 2 bleed air control 
switches and for the propeller synchrophaser switch.  Those 3 switches were used daily and 
Air Nelson had no history of defects with them.  In contrast, the inhibit switch was r arely used.  
Bombardier advised that the calculated mean time between unscheduled removals of this 
type of  switch was more than  220 million flight hours.  
3.3.8.  On 12 February 2011  Air Nelson  suspended the use of the Minimum Equipment List provision 
to operat e with an inoperative  nosewheel steering  system , because , unless the cause of the 
defect could be positively determined, normal extension of the landing gear could also be 
affected .  Bombardier later amended the Minimum Equipment List Procedures Manual to 
require verification  that hydraulic pressure was available for the normal extension of the nose 
landing gear  before commencing a flight  with an inoperative nosewheel steering system.  
Failure of nose landing gear  to extend by the  alternate system  
3.3.9.  The followin g potential causes of this failure were examined : 
 the method used by the first officer to pull the uplock  release  handle  
 a failure of the release cable  to open  the uplock  
 a restriction or failure of an hydraulic actuator  
 a failure of the bypass valve  (when opening the alternate release door)  
 incorrectly rigged mechanical components  
 a mechanical obstruction of the nose landing gear  doors, wheels or strut.   
  
Report 11 -002 
<< Page 15 >>
 3.3.10.  The first 2 possibilities are discussed fully in the next section.  
3.3.11.  The rigging of the bypass valv e and the nose landing gear  assembly , including the doors, were 
checked and no fault  was found.   There was no indication of mechanical binding or 
obstruction.  
3.3.12.  The nose landing gear  actuator and the drag strut actuator were removed and examined by 
their man ufacturer, Messier -Dowty INC, under the supervision of an investigator from the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada on behalf of the Commission.  No faults were found.  
3.3.13.  The nose landing gear  door actuator, mechanical sequence valve and steering manifold 
assembly and steering actuator were examined .  No fault was found.  
Nose landing gear  alternate extension  rigging and operation  
3.3.14.  The nose landing gear  uplock did not release at Wellington in spite of the first officer pulling 
the release handle  with what he b elieved was a lot of force.  He took part in subsequent 
testing and observed that there was a more marked change in the force required between the 
doors opening and the uplock releasing than there had been on the accident aeroplane, but 
that the handle pulled out about as far .  Some of the Air Nelson training captains who took 
part in these t ests expressed surprise at the force required to release the uplock.  
3.3.15.  The rigging of the nose landing gear  alternate extension system on ZK -NEQ was checked  and 
no discrepancy was found.  
3.3.16.  The Q300 Maintenance Manual procedure for rigging the alternate extension system did not 
specify a value or range for the uplock release force or for the cable extension.  Bombardier 
advised that no values had been  specified because aeroplanes had individual mechanical 
characteristics.  It said that pilots should pull the handle with whatever force and for as long 
as it takes to release an uplock , and that the release handle should be pulled in one 
movement.  Air Nelson's training had generally emphasis ed that it was a single movement, 
noting that after the doors had opened the required force would seem to increase  until the 
uplock was released.   
3.3.17.  Air Nelson  undertook a fleet -wide inspection of the nose landing gear alternate extension 
system and measured the forces required to open the doors and release the uplocks.  There 
was some variability according to whether the handle was pulled swiftly in one movement, or 
the tension held while  the doo rs opened and then increased until  the uplock re lease d. 
3.3.18.  The results of the fleet inspection are summarised below:  
 if the  uplock release  handle was pulled i n one movement, the highest force was 65 
kg.  The force increased proportionally with the rate  at which the handle was pulled  
 if an arbitrary 5 -second delay was observed  between the door  locks releasing and 
making a further pull to release the uplock , the peak force reduced to as little as 25 
kg 
 if the handle was pulled beyond th e point at which the doors opened until an increase 
in pull force was felt and then held, the additional force required to release the u plock 
was significantly reduced  
 the time for the doors to open fully was consistent ly about 2 sec onds16 
 the release handle could  be pulled fully up  in less than 2 sec onds .  
3.3.19.  Air Nelson  later advised its pilots when carrying out an alternate extension of the nose landing 
gear to use a 2 -stage pull: the first was that usually applied  to open the doors for the pre -flight 
check , followed by a pause for up to 5 second s to allow  the doors to open , and then  a strong, 
continu ous pull until the advisory position light showed that the nose landing gear had locked 
                                                        
16 Bombardier later submitted t hat the time for the nose landing gear doors to open i s reduced for an  aircraft in flight . 

<< Page 16 >>
 Report 11 -002 down .  Air Nelson  said that with this technique an average force of 30 k g was enough to 
release th e nose landing gear  uplock.   
3.3.20.  ZK-NEQ was returned to service on 24 March 2011.  
Other occurrences  
3.3.21.  Air Nelson pilots  had resorted to the Alternate Gear E xtension procedure successfully 5 times 
on air transport flights, with 4 of those occasions having been caused by a loss of system 
hydraulic pressure.  Th e procedure had not been required previously to deal with  the landing  
gear not extend ing when selected DOWN.  Even with the 2 recent occurrences, Air Nelson 's 
rate of landing gear failure -to-extend incidents  was marginally be tter than  the global rate 
advised by Bombardier (0.029 per 1000 flight hours).  
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  On 9 February the  crew reported for duty at 0655 after an overnight and 10 hours free of duty 
at Invercargill.  They  flew 3 sectors in ZK -NEQ before arriving at Hamilton . 
3.4.2.  The captain  had joined Air Nelson  in January 2006  and obtained a Q300 type rating , as a first 
officer , in September 2007.  He had been  promoted to captain in March 2009.   He held an 
airline transport pilot licence (aeroplane) , issued in December 2008 , and a valid Class 1 
medical certificate with no conditions, restrictions or endorsements.   His total flight time 
experience to 8 February 2011  was about 5550 hours, of which about 2310 hours were on 
the Q300.   The capt ain's previous flight crew competency check had been  conducted on 29 
October 2010 and his previous line check on 26 August 2010 . 
3.4.3.  The captain said that during the Invercargill overnight he had had 7 hours of good sleep.  His 
last rostered day off had been on 5 February  2011 .  He had flown about 56 hours in the 30 
days prior to 9 February 2011,  and about 23 hours i n the 7 days prior.  
3.4.4.  The first officer had joined Air Nelson  in August 2008  and completed the Q300 type rating 
course that month.  He held an air tr ansport pilot licence (aeroplane) , issued in August 2010 , 
and a valid Class 1 medical certificate with no conditions, restrictions or endorsements .  His 
total flight time experience to 9 February 2011 was about 2443 hours, of which abou t 1315 
hours were on  the Q300.   The first officer had completed a flight crew competency check on 7 
December 2010 and his previous line check had been  conducted on 1 November 2010 . 
3.4.5.  The first officer said that during the Invercargill overnight he had had  7 hours of broken, but  
sufficient sleep.  His last rostered day off had been on 5 February 2011.  He had flown about 
39 hours in the 30 days prior to 9 February 2011 , and 26 hours in the 7 days prior . 
3.4.6.  The flight attendant had joined the company in  August 2006 and qualified as a flight 
attendant on both Saab 340 and Q300 aeroplanes.  Her previous line check had been 
completed on 24 January 2011.  
3.5. Aerodrome information  
3.5.1.  Woodbourne Aerodrome is 6 kilometres west of Blenheim in a broad valley.  The  circuit for the

 3.6. Other information  
Flight simulator requirements  
3.6.1.  An aircraft flight simulator that is used for type rating training is certificated by the National  
Aviation Authorities  of the simulator operator and of the airline and pilots who wish to obtain 
credit for its use.  The certification level depends on the simulator fidelity , that is, how 
faithfully the simulator  reproduces the flight and system characteristics , or the "look and feel ", 
of the aircraft.   The e valuation of si mulators entail s objective and subjective tests.17  Objective 
testing is performed on primary flight controls only, and requires a computer -based 
comparison of the simulator performance with that of the actual aircraft, using validated 
reference data .  Each test must meet mandated tolerances.  Generally , the primary flight 
control forces ex erted by pilots must be within 2.25 k g of the reference forces.   The secondary 
controls, such as  the alternate landing gear mechanism, are subjectively assessed for their 
function and performance by approved pilots . 
3.6.2.  The Civil Aviation Authority approved simulators in accordance with Civil Aviation Rule 121.11, 
which stated in part:  
121.11 Flight simulator and other training device approval  
(a) A holder of an air operator certificate must ensure that each flight simulator, 
or training device, that is used in the certificate holder's training programme is 
specifically approved for — 
(1) use by the certificate holder; and  
(2) the aeroplane type and, if applicable, the particul ar variant within that 
type, for which the training or check is being conducted; and  
(3) the particular manoeuvre, procedure, or crew member function 
involved.  
(b) The certificate holder must ensure that any flight simulator or any training 
device that is used to accrue flight credits — 
(1) maintains the performance, functional, and other characteristics that 
are required for approval; and  
(2) is modified to conform with any modification to the aeroplane being 
simulated that results in changes to performance , functional, or other 
characteristics required for approval; and …  
3.6.3.  The Civil Aviation Authority said that the simulator procedure for an alternate landing gear 
extension did not require specific approv al.  Prior to Air Nelson  installing a  Q300 simulator  in 
Auckland,  its pilots had been trained in simulators in Canada and Australia .  The National  
Aviation  Authorities  of these  3 countries confirmed that the simulated Q300 u plock release 
force was assessed subjectively.  Transport Canada explained that the we ar caused by 
unusually frequent use of the simulator alternate landing gear extension mechanism and the 
variability of wear across operators' fleets made  the isolation of a representative force very 
difficult .  The Civil Aviation Safety Authority  of Austra lia noted that a recent check of the 
Australian Q300 simulator "found subjectively that there was sufficient resistant and release 
forces to indicate to the pilot that the gear up -locks  had been released and the gear had 
extended ".   
3.6.4.  The forces required for the alternate nose landing gear extension procedure in Air Nelson's 
simulator were measured with the same strain gauge that was used for the fleet check .  The 
average forces were  6.5 k g to open the doors and 8.1 k g to release the uplock .  Depending on 
the technique used, the actual force required to release the uplock averaged 30 k g on the 
fleet check, and the maximum measured was 65 k g.

 Report 11 -002 QRH  procedures  
3.6.5.  The requirement for an operator to provide pilots with a flight check system is given in Civil 
Aviation Rule 121.77, which states in part:  
The certificate holder shall ensure that the system enables safe real -time decision 
making and aeroplane management by conforming with the principles —  
(1) contained in the aeroplane flight manual; and  
(2) conta ined in the manufacturer 's technical and safety instructions.  
3.6.6.  A QRH provide s pilots with the necessary procedures and guidance to deal with most non-
normal  and emergency situations that might occur.  It is derived from, but subordinate to, the 
approved aircraft flight manual and is not evaluated as a part of the aircraft type certification 
process.  Operators may adapt aircraft manufacturers ' QRH s to suit their flight operations 
philosophy and practice.  Amendments to a QRH must  be notifi ed to the Civil Aviation 
Authority, but do not require its approval . 
3.6.7.  The preface to the Bombardier Q300 QRH was similar to those in the QRH s of other aircraft 
manufacturers in stating (Bombardier, 2009, p.i, ii):  
It is th e operator's responsibility to ensure the checklists are applicable to their 
type of operation.  In the event of an inconsistency between any checklist and the 
approved [aircraft flight manual], the [aircraft flight manual] takes precedence.  
Pilots must be  aware that checklists cannot be created for all conceivable 
situations and are not intended to preclude good judgement.  In some cases 
deviation from the checklists may, at the discretion of the [pilot in command], be 
necessary…  
The Non -normal/Emergency c hecklist assumes that if an indicating light 
associated with a system is not illuminating, the integrity of the bulb is checked 
prior to referring to the checklist.  
3.6.8.  The Air Nelson Q300 training course and its QRH had not, prior to this accident , included t he 
notes in the Bombardier aircraft flight manual concerning the forces required when pulling the 
landing gear alternate release handles.  The absence of that important information , 
particularly from  the QRH,  had not been noticed when the Civil Aviation Au thority determin ed 
the acceptability of Air Nelson's training and operational manual suite.     
3.6.9.  Air Nelson  was one of a number of Q300 operators that had asked Bombardier to provide a 
specific procedure  for a landing gear leg not extending when selected DOWN, and for landing s 
with non-normal  gear configuration s, for example with the nose landing gear  retracted.  In 
response, in March 2008 Bombardier  issued a Service Letter containing considerations for 
pilots  if the Alternate Gear Extension procedure did not result in all of the gear lock ing down.18 
3.6.10.  Air Nelson had customised a procedure, "Landing gear fails to extend ", that was not in the 
Bombardier QRH , but which was based on information in Bombardier Service Letters .  The Air 
Nelson procedure firstly checked that a normal extension had not been prevented by the flight 
deck switches being incorrectly configured, and also involved checking the verification lights.  
If those checks did not correct the condition, the procedure led to the Alternate Gear 
Extension procedure . 
3.6.11.  After this accident, Air Nelson amended its QRH "Landing gear fails to extend " procedure by 
adding an initial step to cycle the landing gear selector lever .  However, that change was 
reversed after Bombardier issued Service Letter DH8 -SL-32-030A in Jul y 2011, stating that 
cycling the landing gear should be considered only as a last resort . 
3.6.12.  During this accident, the first officer m isread the adjacent items "alternate release door " and 
"alternate extension door ' in the QRH checklist for "Landing gear fails to extend " (see 
                                                        
18 Bom bardier Flight Operations Service Letter DH8 -SL-32-026, 10 March 2008.

 paragraph 3.1. 9).  A similar error had occurred prior to the 1995  accident, referred to earlier, 
even though in that case  the 2 items were separated by another action .19  The steps are also 
separated in the "Alternate gear extension or 'LDG GEAR INOP ' (Caution Light) " procedure  in 
the Bombardier flight manual . 
3.6.13.  The report on the 1995 accident cited the similarly named items in close proximity within an 
un-numbered checklis t as a contributory factor in that accident .  At that time, t he Commission 
recommended to Ansett New Zealand that similar equipment names  be eliminated , but t he 
airline  replied that t he naming of items was a matter for the manufacturer .  The Commission 
did not then repeat the recommendation to Bombardier .  After  the February 2011 occurrence , 
Bombardier said that it considered that a pilot mistaking the 2 items in the Alternate Gear 
Extension procedure was a tra ining issue.  
3.6.14.  In its report on the 1995 accident, the Commission quoted from  a Flight Safety Foundation 
report that had recommended n umbering the steps of a non-normal  or emergency procedure 
checklist as a method for reducing checklist reading errors  (Flight Safety Foundation, 1995, 
p.5).  However, the Commission at the time did not explicitly make that recommend ation .  
Bombardier noted after th e February 2011 occurrence  that checklist procedural steps were 
numbered in its Q300 aeroplane flight manual.  The Commission observed that the practice of 
numbering the procedural steps in QRH checklists was increasingly followed  for newer aircraft 
types.

 Report 11 -002 4. Analysis  
4.1. The landing gear did not extend on arrival at Wellington because of a fault with the inhibit 
switch.  The aeroplane was required to have  an alternat ive system to extend the landing gear 
when the normal system failed .  The alternative extension system was capable of getting all of 
the landing gear down and locked on this occasion.  There was  no technical reason for the 
nose landing gear not extend ing. 
4.2. The main point of discussion in the following analysis is centred on why the crew actions did 
not succeed in getting the nosewheel down and locked using the alternate extension 
procedure.  
4.3. The lo ss of nosewheel steering prior to  departure from Hamilton was also linked to the faulty 
inhibit switch .  The first event was therefore a precursor to the second  and this is also 
discussed.  
4.4. Although not contributory to the ac cident , some safety issues around the design and use of 
QRH checklists and how they are followed were identified.  These are discussed also.  
Inhibit switch defect  
4.5. The pilots had no in formation to suggest what had caused  the nosewheel steering failure  at 
Hamilton .  Their reference to  the QRH and Minimum Equipment List and their decision to 
continu e the flight w ere appropriate  responses .  However, w ithout  nosewheel steering the 
aeroplane  was restricted to taking off and landing in  crosswind s of less than  20 knots and 
would have had difficulty using some airport gates with tight turning circles.  For these reasons 
it would have been prudent for the pilots to advise  the operator sooner of the defect.  
4.6. The nosewheel steering failure  was caused by an intermittent defect in the inhibit switch.  
Although the switch was in the NORMAL position, the defect caused the landing gear extend 
solenoid  to de -energise .  Consequently  the landing gear system hydraulic extend lines  did not 
pressurise.  The nosewheel steering system is pressuri sed by the  extend line , which is why  it 
stopped working.  
4.7. The inhibit switch position does not affect landing gear retraction .  When the landing gear was 
selected UP after take -off from Hamilton , the extend solenoid would have gone to the de-
energise d state  in any case .  However , when the landing gear was selected DOWN at 
Wellington , the defective  inhibit switch  prevented the extend solenoid energising .  Therefore 
hydraulic pressure was not directed to extend the landing gear. 
4.8. The decision to permit operati ons without the nosewheel steering appears to have been based  
on operational considerations  only and to have not considered the potential for a related 
system failure.  
4.9. Air Nelson considered the inhibit switch to have excellent r eliability , and global data from 
Bombardier confirmed that.  However, in order to reduce  the chance of a similar defect 
causing multiple system failure s, Bombardier promptly amended the Q300 Minimum 
Equipment List to require confirm ation  that hydraulic pressure was available for norm al 
landing gear extension before an aeroplane may be dispatched with the nosewheel steering 
system  inoperative . 
4.10.  If the revised requirements  had been in place at the time , the pilots would have  return ed to 
the gate .  Maintenance staff would have found that no hydraulic pressure was available and 
the problem would have been rectified before the a eroplane  was released to service.  The 
landing gear would then have lowered normally when next selected DOWN . 
  
  
Report 11 -002 
<< Page 21 >>
 Findings :  
A faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel steering when the aircraft was 
departing from Hamilton.  
The same faulty inhibit switch was the cause of the landing gear not extending 
normally when the aircraft was approaching Wellington.  
The Minimum Equipment List provision that  had previously  allow ed a flight to 
commence without  an operative  nosewheel steering system appeared to be based on 
operational considerations  only, and to have not considered the possibility of a related 
system failure . 
 
 
Failure of nose landing gear  to extend by alternate system   
4.11.  The nose landing gear was found to be r etracted  when the aeroplane nose was raised from 
the runway .  The uplock released readily when the release handle was pulled.  Photographs 
confirmed that the nose landing gear had not extended  before the landing , but they could not 
prove whether  the uplock had released  during the Alternate Gear E xtension procedure .  
However, that possibility was discounted for 2 reasons.  The cockpit voice recorder had not 
recorded the sound of the uplock relea sing; and the aeroplane had settled onto the open nose 
landing gear doors after touchdown , and not  onto partially  extended nosewheels  that w ould 
have been  pushed back into the wheel well . 
4.12.  If the uplock did not release either time that the first officer pul led the release handle , even 
though he  was sure that he had pulled the handle hard enough, he must have been mistaken  
as to the force required.   No other explanation wa s found for the nose landing gear not 
extend ing. 
4.13.  Bom bardier subsequently published a Service Letter that advis ed that up to 40 k g of force 
was required to release the landing gear  uplock s manually .  Air Nelson found that t he average 
force required was 30 k g.  The first officer did manage to release the main landing gear 
uplock , but there we re at least 3 factors  that might have contributed to his not releas ing the 
nose landing gear uplock : 
 the technique described in the Air Nelson publications for pulling the nose landing 
gear uplock release handle was not consistent , and the information in the Bombardier 
flight manual and in Safety of Flight Supplement No.7 had not been provided to pilots  
 pilots were  very used to pulling the nose landing gear uplock release handle  a short 
distance, enough  to open the forward doors, f or which an average force of 8 k g was 
sufficient .  They were not used to  the greater  force required to release the uplock  
 the flight simulator did not accurately reproduce or differentiate the actual forces 
required to open the nose landing gear doors and uplock on the aeroplane.  
4.14.  The Air Nelson  Q300 Systems Training Manual described the change in  the required force  
when the nose landing gear alternate release handle was pulled  as a detent.  Although there 
was not an actual mechanical detent, p ilots were used to feeling a change in the force  
requirement from  their experience of open ing the doors only for daily pre -flight external 
inspection s.  As springs assist ed the doors to open, a light pull force was enough  for that . 
4.15.  However, t he Training Manual also instructed pilots to pull the handle "in one contin uous 
motion " when performing an actual alternate extension .  Air Nelson  trials showed that if  the 
handle was pulled quickly , the uplock would  release immediately , but the mechanical 
sequence valve could  prevent the landing gear leg mov ing until the forward doors were  open .  
In that case, a n apparently strong  pull on the handle might  have been  ineffective  if it was 
relaxed  too early and the uplock then re-engage d before the nose landing gear had begun to 
move down . 

<< Page 22 >>
 Report 11 -002 4.16.  Following this accident Air Nelson amended its Q300 pilot training to recommend a 2 -stage 
pull on the uplock release handle during an alternate extension procedure, a technique that 
the airline considered reduce d the maximum force required.  If pilots pause after re leasing the 
door locks, then pull the handle hard  and maintain the tension until the uplock release s, the 
alternate extension procedure should  be successful.  
4.17.  The nose landing gear forward doors were open w hen the first officer  tried again to release the 
uplock .  It is likely that h e used a similar force as on his  first attempt, as he described it as "an 
easy pull ".  Even if he had pulled harder  and with considerably more force t han he was used to 
when open ing just the doors, that force might still have been less than was needed  to release 
the uplock.  There fore,  his training and experience , and the QRH procedure at the time,  had 
not give n him  adeq uate guidance as to the force r equired.  
4.18.  During the alternate landing gear  extension s conducted in the hangar after the accident, some 
senior Air Nelson  pilots expressed surprise at the force required to release the uplock.  Th eir 
reaction s confirmed that not all of the operator's pilots had been adequately trained for the 
alternate extension procedure.  
4.19.  Alternate extensions of the landing gear are performed d uring periodic maintenance and 
occasional troubleshooting .  Airlines could use th ese maintenance opportunities to give their 
pilots experience of the actual force s required to release the uplock s. 
4.20.  If a simulate d characteristic differs significantly from that on the actual aircraft, pilots should 
be made aware of that during their training and reminded of this in any relevant QRH 
procedure.  Bombardier and Air Nelson later amended their QRH procedures for alterna te 
landing gear extension s to include the note (from the Bombardier flight manual) that the 
release handle forces could  be greater than those experienced in training.  
4.21.  On the aeroplane, the force to open the doors only ranged between 6 and 8 k g, and the 
simulator also needed only a pull of 6 k g.  Pilots frequently open ed the doors only, so their arm 
muscles w ere likely to have a "memory " of th e force  required .  However, whereas a pull of 25 
to 50 kg or more was required to release the uplock  in the aeroplane, the simulator  force was 
only 8 kg.  Therefore the simulator did not accurately simulate or differentiate the forces 
required in the aeroplane.  
4.22.  The Civil Aviation Authority and 2 other National Aviation Authorities said that subjective 
testing of the simulated alternate landing gear extension mechanism was sufficient.  The 
difficulty of determining a reference uplock release force , which would be necessary for 
objective test ing, is acknowledged .  However, the simulated force  should do more  than simply 
"indicate to the pilot that the gear up -locks had been released and the gear had extended ".  
As this accident showed, a major goal of the exercise should be to make pilots familiar with 
the magnitude of t he force required to release the uplock  compared with that for releasing the 
door locks .  Therefore , the simulated forces should be very similar t o the actual forces 
required.   
4.23.  The previously light forces in the Air Nelson  simulator had resulted in p ilots being mis -trained.   
Had the simulator more closely represented the actual forces required, it is likely that the first 
officer would have succeeded with the procedure and that the occurrence would have been 
avoided.    
4.24.  Air Nelson later modified its Q300 flight simulator so tha t the forces were at the high end of 
the range of forces  encountered on the aeroplane . 
4.25.  Although the sole Dash 8/ Q300 simulator in New Zealand has been modified, the Commission 
recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation liaise with Transport Canada to make other 
National Aviation Authorities aware of this incident and of the desirability of Dash 8 flight 
simulat ors closely represent ing the actual forces required for a landing gear alternate 
extension.  
4.26.  The captain's  decision not to cycle the landing gear  and attempt another alternate extension , 
as the technical staff  recommended , was reasonable .  More than  20 minutes had been spent 
circling while technical staff sought a solution, so the aeroplane fuel state was low.  He was 
  
Report 11 -002 
<< Page 23 >>
 responsible for the safety of the aeroplane and t he QRH procedure began w ith a warning that 
the landing gear  could not be retracted after an alt ernate extension .  At the time, there was no 
published procedure for reversing the steps of the Alternate Gear Extension  procedure .  A 
method for retracting the landing gear could have been deduced , and might have been 
successful , but it would have put the pilots in the unusual position of having to assess the 
acceptability of an unfamiliar  procedure.  
Finding s:  
There was no defect with the alternate extension system that would have prevented 
any of the landing gear extend ing and locking down.  
The nose landing gear uplock did not release during the alternate extension procedure 
because the release handle had not been pulled hard enough or had not been held for 
as long as it took for the uplock to release.  
The training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension 
procedure did not include  key information provided by Bombardier  concerning the 
release handle forces , and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure.  
The simulator that Air Nelson used for training its pilots in the alternate landing gear 
extension procedure was not representative of the actual forces  required to release 
the uplock . 
 
 
QRH format  and use  
4.27.  When reading the QRH checklists, t he first officer  made 2 inconsequential errors  that could 
have been caused , in part,  by his reading them too quickly .  The considerations listed with a 
QRH non-normal  or emergency procedure must be evaluated carefully if t he procedure is  to be 
effective , so time must be allowed for both pilots to assimilate each step . 
4.28.  The misreading of the QRH also highlighted the importance of checklists being formatted so 
that reader s do not lose their place and omit potentially critical steps, as appeared to happen 
when the first officer was reading  the "Landing gear fails to extend " procedure  (see paragraph 
3.1.9).  The tone of his voice suggested that he might have thought he was repeat ing the step 
for the alternate release  door, then  omitte d the step for the alternate extension door .  
However, the captain later said that he had seen from the first officer's hand movements that 
both steps were completed , and both doors were found open after the landing . 
4.29.  Similarly, the first officer appe ared to  lose his  place before reading the sixth  step in that 
excerpt , perhaps because successive lines in the checklist beg an with the words "Landing 
gear".  These minor errors , neither of which contributed to the accident,  show how the 
checklist format can lead to a step being mistaken or omitte d. 
4.30.  The potential for confusing  similar items, like  "alternate release door " and "alternate 
extension door ", when the y are adjacent items in a checklist was referred to  in the report into  
the 1995 accident . 
4.31.  Air Nel son had reduced this risk in its "Alternate gear extension " checklist by adding the 
location of the item (see Appendix, 
<< page 3 >>
) .  The airline later advised th e Commission th at the 
"Landing gear fails to extend " checklist would be similarly improved as part of a project then 
underway to align its manuals with "airline industry best practice ". 
4.32.  An additional safeguard against losing one's place when reading a checklist is to number each 
step in the procedure , as the Commission  recommended to Ansett New Zealand in it s report 
on the 1995 accident .  In February 2011 the emergency and non -normal procedures in the 
Bombardier  Q300 flight manual  had numbered steps .  However, neither the Bombardier nor  

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 11 -002 the Air Nelson QRH did.  Air Nelson later advised that its manual review project would include 
improvements to QRH  readability, including the numbering of procedural steps . 
4.33.  The Commission noted with concern that although these QRH formatting issues were 
identified many years a go, some airlines had been slow to adopt the associated 
recommendations.  
4.34.  As the content and format of a QRH are not regulated, unlike the associated aircraft flight 
manual, and may be varied by operators, the Commission recommends that the Director of 
Civil Aviation urge operators to adopt QRH checklist formats that reduce the possibility of 
misreading or omitting a procedural step.  
Finding  
The similarity of text in adjacent steps of the QRH  and the lack of numbered steps  
contributed to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non-
normal  procedures.   However, these errors did not contribute to the accident.  
 
Communications  
4.35.  The pilots kept the flight attendant well  informed, and the passengers we re well informed by 
both the pilots and  the flight attendant.  The following observations consider opportunities for 
more effective communication between the pilots , and between them and other airline staff.  
4.36.  Under normal flight conditions , procedur es that are routine and standardised  are performed 
by pilots with a minimal amount of direction and co-ordination , and often using  non-verbal 
communication such as gestures .  However , when a non-normal  or emergency procedure  is 
required , the actions will be less familiar and the outcomes less certain .  It is important that 
each pilot knows what the other is doing  when dealing with a non-normal  situation .  In that 
respect, the first officer ought to  have clearly checked with the captain before  trying to releas e 
the nose landing gear uplock  the second time . 
4.37.  The captain was not required to inform Air Nelson of the nosewheel steering defect before the 
flight depart ed Hamilton .  However, although the pilots later asked for details of the defect to 
be passed to the operator, th e operator's staff could not recall having received that 
information .  If the technical staff had known of the steering defect sooner, th ey might have 
recognise d the connection with the failure of the normal landing gear  exten sion.  Whether that 
knowledge would have prevent ed the accident cannot be said , but having pertinent  
information generally assists with better decision -making . 
4.38.  The QRH procedure for landing with a  non-normal  landing gear configuration specified making 
the cabin  announcement "Brace  for impact " when the aeroplane was passing 500 feet, or 
about 45  seconds before touchdown.  On the accident flight the captain made the 
announcement 2 minutes before landing, in order to complete the checks and let the pilo ts 
concentra te on the landing.  While the intention was understandable , it resulted in the 
"Brace! " call being  made much too soon , and obliged the flight attendant to repeat her 
comman ds over and over  until the aeroplane landed .  The long wait for the landing would have 
been  likely to cause unnecessary stress  in the cabin  and could have led to some passengers 
looki ng up from the brace position.  The pilots ought to have adhered to the QRH  guidance . 
4.39.  The relaying of questions and suggestions between Air Nelson technica l staff and the pilots, 
via the air traffic control tower, was necessary in this case, but cumbersome .  Fortunately the 
controller had diverted other traffic from the control zone , an option that was  not usually 
possible .  Communication through a third par ty takes longer, hinders full discussion and can 
lead to misunderstanding s and "lost" information , all of which are undesirable when trying to 
resolve an airborne emergency.  The different reports about whether or how many of the nose 
doors were open  also did not help the pilots to  understand the situation  correctly .  Having the 
capability for d irect air-ground -air communication assists airlines in the operational control of  
their aircraft .

 5. Findings  
5.1. A faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel  steering when the aircraft was departing 
from Hamilton . 
5.2. The same faulty inhibit switch was the cause of the landing gear not extending normally when 
the aircraft was approaching Wellington . 
5.3. The Minimum Equipment List provision that had previously allowed a flight to commence 
without an operative  nosewheel steering system appeared to be based on operational 
considerations only, and to have not considered the possibility of a related system failure.  
5.4. There was no defect with the alternate extension system tha t would have prevented any of the 
landing gear extending and locking down.  
5.5. The nose landing gear uplock did not release during the alternate extension procedure 
because the release handle had not been pulled hard enough or had not been held for as long 
as it took for the uplock to release.  
5.6. The training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension procedure 
did not include  key information provided by Bombardier concerning  the release handle forces , 
and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure.  
5.7. The simulator that Air Nelson used for training its pilots in the alternate landing gear extension 
procedure was not representative of the actual forces required to release the uplock.  
5.8. The similarity of text  in adjacent steps of the QRH and the lack of numbered steps  contributed 
to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non -normal procedures .  
However, these errors did not contribute to the accident.

 Report 11 -002 6. Key lessons  
6.1. In their simulator training pilots should be taught how to perform emergency and non -normal 
procedures as robustly and rigorously as if the procedures were being performed on the actual 
aircraft.  
6.2. Pilots should be informed of flight simulat or characteristics that differ from those in the 
aircraft t o ensure t hat pilots are not  misled during actual flight operations.  
6.3. QRHs should be designed to minimise the potential for error as they are used by pilots during 
times of high workload and, potentially, high stress when dealing with  emergencies .

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission that would otherwise have result ed in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally  have  result ed in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
 Safety a ctions  that pre -empted issuing a recommendation  
7.2 On 17 February 2011,  8 days after the accident, Bombardier amended the Minimum 
Equipment List Procedures Manual item 32 -3 to require verification that hydraulic pressure 
was available for the normal extension of nose landing gear before oper ating with an 
inoperative nosewheel steering system.  
7.3 On 2 1 April 2011 Bombardier published Flight Operations Service Letter DH8 -SL-32-030A "to 
remind Flight Crew of the appropriate procedures for operating the landing gear  utilizing the 
normal or alternate  extension systems ".  The Service Letter also provided "considerations for 
Flight Crew if confronted with a non-normal  landing gear  configuration, which cannot be 
rectified with the existing Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) procedures established within the sc ope 
of certification requirements ". 
7.4 As well as repeating procedures and considerations already  included in the aircraft flight 
manual  and Bombardier QRH , the Service Letter noted the following:  
 flight crew should check the serviceability of indication lights when an expected 
gear configuration is not observed  
 cycling the gear as an intermediate step to achieve an all gear down -and-locked 
indication is not approved or recommended  
 the main and nose  landing gear  release handles are pulled with sufficient force 
(may exceed 90 pounds [40 kilograms]) to release the doors and uplocks.  Pull 
forces in the air will likely be greater than th ose experienced on the ground or in 
a simulator .  Continue pulling with whatever force is necessary to achieve release 
of all gear uplock s 
 ensure the alternate gear indication lights are checked with the taxi light OFF . 
7.5 The Service Letter noted that a defect that prevented normal and alternate extension s of the 
landing ge ar was outside the aircraft certification standards and would usually result in an 
emergency landing with an unusual landing gear  configuration.  For such a case , Bombardier 
introduced with this Service Letter a procedure for  resetting the alternate extens ion system  
and retracting the landing gear.  If successful, that would give the captain the option of cycling 
the landing gear  in an  attempt to get all of the landing gear  down and locked.  
7.6 On 28 May 2011 Bombardier advised Air Nelson  that it would add the following note, which 
was already in the aircraft flight manual,  to the Bombardier QRH  Alternate Gear Extension  
procedure : 
[Landing] g ear release handle loads may exceed those experienced during 
practice extensions.  
7.7 In July 2011 Air Nelson am ended its Q300 QRH to incorporate the above procedural changes 
and advice from Bombardier.  
7.8 During 2011 Air Nelson modified its Q300 simulator so that the landing gear uplock release 
handle loads were m ore representative of those required  on the aeroplane.

 Report 11 -002 7.9 On 8 May 2012 Bombardier advised operators of the Dash 8 series of aeroplanes, which 
included the Q300, that t he following notes would be added to the aircraft flight manuals at 
the next revision:  
NOTE  
The main landing gear release handle pull force will be significantly higher 
than experienced during practice alternate landing gear extensions.  The 
required pull force to release the main landing gear uplocks can be as high as 
ninety pounds [40 kilograms ].  It may require a repeated pull effort to achieve 
a main landing gear down and locked indication.  
 
NOTE  
The nose landing gear release handle pull force will be significantly higher 
than experienced during practice alternate landing gear extensions.  The 
required pull force to release the nose landing gear uplock can be as high as 
ninety pounds [40 kilograms] .  It may require a repeated pull effort to achieve 
a nose landing gear down and locked indication.  
 
7.10 On 31 July 2012 Air Nelson advised the Commission that it was well underway with a project 
to review all of its policies and procedures to ensure that they  were aligned with recognised 
airline industry best practice.  Improvement s to the QRH format w ere included in that process.  
7.11 On 2  December 201 2 the Civil Aviation Authority  advised that it had "strengthened its 
certification process  for air operator exposi tions to include an evaluation of operator flight 
procedures for large aircraft against the criteria specified in [Civil Aviation  Rule] 121.77, and 
in cases where an operator has developed its own procedures, confirmation that these 
procedures included all  pertinent information provided by the manufacturer ".

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1 The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to the Civil Aviation Authority . 
8.2 In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recomm endation s 
8.3 On 14 December 2012  the Commission  recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
liaise with Transport Canada to make other National Aviation Authorities aware of this incident 
and of the desirability of Dash 8 flight simulators closely representing the actual forces 
required for a landing gear alternate extension .  (036/12)  
8.4 On 14 December 2012  the Commission recommend ed to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
urge operators to adopt QRH checklist formats that reduce the possibility of misreading or 
omitting a procedural step .  (037/12 ) 
8.5 On 16 Januray 2013 the Director of Civil Aviation confirmed that the recommendations would 
be implemented by the Aircraft Cetification Group and the Air Transport and Airworthiness 
Group (036/12 and 037/1 2, respectively.  Implementation dates had yet to be finalised.
