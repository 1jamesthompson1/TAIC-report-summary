- name: Inhibit Switch Reliability and System Redundancy
  explanation: The inhibit switch defect was a critical factor in the accident, as it caused both the loss of nosewheel steering and the failure of the landing gear to extend normally. The report states that "a faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel steering when the aircraft was departing from Hamilton" and "the same faulty inhibit switch was the cause of the landing gear not extending normally when the aircraft was approaching Wellington" (5.1, 5.2). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of system reliability and the need for effective redundancy in critical systems to prevent a single point of failure from leading to an accident.
- name: Crew Training and Familiarity with Emergency Procedures
  explanation: The training provided to the pilots did not adequately prepare them for the alternate landing gear extension procedure. The report found that "the training that Air Nelson gave its pilots on the alternate landing gear extension procedure did not include key information provided by Bombardier concerning the release handle forces, and there was no guidance in the QRH procedure" (5.6). This theme is significant because it underscores the necessity for comprehensive training that includes all relevant information and prepares crew members for emergency situations they may encounter.
- name: Simulator Fidelity and Training Effectiveness
  explanation: The simulator used for training did not accurately represent the actual forces required to release the uplock, which contributed to the failure of the alternate landing gear extension procedure during the accident. The report indicates that "the simulator that Air Nelson used for training its pilots in the alternate landing gear extension procedure was not representative of the actual forces required to release the uplock" (5.7). This theme is relevant as it emphasizes the importance of high-fidelity simulators in pilot training to ensure that pilots are fully prepared for the physical realities of emergency procedures.
- name: QRH Design and Usability
  explanation: The design and usability of the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were identified as factors that could lead to errors during emergency procedures. The report notes that "the similarity of text in adjacent steps of the QRH and the lack of numbered steps contributed to the first officer making minor errors in reading the landing gear non-normal procedures" (5.8). This theme is relevant because it highlights the need for clear, well-structured emergency procedures to minimize the risk of misinterpretation or omission during high-stress situations.
- name: Communication and Information Sharing
  explanation: Effective communication and information sharing are crucial in emergency situations. The report discusses opportunities for more effective communication between pilots and between pilots and other airline staff, suggesting that "having pertinent information generally assists with better decision-making" (4.37). This theme is relevant to the accident because timely and accurate communication could have provided the technical staff with the information needed to recognize the connection between the nosewheel steering defect and the failure of the normal landing gear extension, potentially preventing the accident.
- name: Operational Decision-Making and Risk Assessment
  explanation: The decision to permit operations without the nosewheel steering was based on operational considerations without fully assessing the potential for related system failures. The report states that "The Minimum Equipment List provision that had previously allowed a flight to commence without an operative nosewheel steering system appeared to be based on operational considerations only, and to have not considered the possibility of a related system failure" (5.3). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for thorough risk assessment and decision-making processes that consider all possible outcomes and interdependencies between systems.
