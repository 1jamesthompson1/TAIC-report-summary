2010_102,022/12,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency monitor the development of current prototype improvements in crashworthiness for the Ganz Mavag rail fleet and requires that such improvements be adopted for any trains that are to remain in service for an appreciable time.,"The driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during the collision sequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their driving positions before impact it was likely that they would have been at least seriously injured.  Although the Ganz Mavag trains were generally strong and well-built and had met the crashworthiness standards at the time of build some 30 years earlier, they did not perform as a more modern train would have been expected to perform during a similar front-end collision, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the driver and possibly passengers seated near the ends of the trains.
","The absence of selcall capability on the Wellington passenger fleet meant there was a delay in train control being made aware of the collision and in turn calling the emergency services. In this case the next train coming from the opposite direction arrived at about the same time that the derailment occurred. In other circumstances a delay in train control becoming aware of such an event in double-track territory is a lost opportunity to warn other trains in the vicinity. The delay can be overcome by fitting an improved radio system with selcall capability to the Wellington commuter rail fleet.

","Most of the passenger trains in the Wellington commuter fleet are not equipped with selcall-capable radio equipment, which means that in the event of an emergency brake application or other event that causes a rapid reduction in air brake pipe pressure, there could be a critical delay in train control being alerted in time to prevent the event escalating.

2010_102,021/12,"KiwiRailâ€™s predecessors determined that the Wellington rail electric multiple unit commuter service was not a single-person operation.  Irrespective of whether these trains were a ""single-person"" or a ""two-person"" operation, as a consequence, the radio system fitted to these trains did not have selcall capability and could not send an alert to train control automatically when there was a rapid drop in brake pipe pressure such as when the driver makes an emergency brake application.  Any delay in train control being alerted to an accident or incident within the double-tracked commuter network is a safety issue.  The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of NZ Transport Agency that he address this safety issue.",,"The absence of selcall capability on the Wellington passenger fleet meant there was a delay in train control being made aware of the collision and in turn calling the emergency services.
