2010_102,022/12,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency monitor the development of current prototype improvements in crashworthiness for the Ganz Mavag rail fleet and requires that such improvements be adopted for any trains that are to remain in service for an appreciable time.,"The driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during the collision sequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their driving positions before impact it was likely that they would have been at least seriously injured.  Although the Ganz Mavag trains were generally strong and well-built and had met the crashworthiness standards at the time of build some 30 years earlier, they did not perform as a more modern train would have been expected to perform during a similar front-end collision, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the driver and possibly passengers seated near the ends of the trains.

2010_102,021/12,"KiwiRailâ€™s predecessors determined that the Wellington rail electric multiple unit commuter service was not a single-person operation.  Irrespective of whether these trains were a ""single-person"" or a ""two-person"" operation, as a consequence, the radio system fitted to these trains did not have selcall capability and could not send an alert to train control automatically when there was a rapid drop in brake pipe pressure such as when the driver makes an emergency brake application.  Any delay in train control being alerted to an accident or incident within the double-tracked commuter network is a safety issue.  The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of NZ Transport Agency that he address this safety issue.",
