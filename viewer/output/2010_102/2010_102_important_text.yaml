  \ \n4.1.1.  The topography around much of the Wellington metropolitan rail network\
  \ is hilly.  Nature has a \nway of both creating and eroding hills over time.  Landsl\
  \ ides are a natural event; they are one \nmechanism of erosion.  If a road or railway\
  \ track is cut into a hillside, the risk of landslide will \nalways be present.\
  \  The risk can be mitigated using good design and drainage of the slope \nabove,\
  \ and also by good op erational practice.  \n4.1.2.  The landslide was a predictable\
  \ event because heavy rain could  trigger landslides and they \nhad occurred at\
  \ that site before.  The report discusses the system for evaluating the risks \n\
  created by a landslide at the accident site , whether it had been reasonably predicted,\
  \ and \nwhat operational factors, if any, could have prevented or minimised the\
  \ impact with the \nlandslide.  \n4.1.3.  Both trains in this event were being operated\
  \ within allowable parameters.  The landslide had \noccurred since the last t rain\
  \ had passed through the area 28 minutes before the arrival of \nTrain 6250.  There\
  \ was little more the driver could have done to prevent his train striking it. \
  \ \nThe arrival of Train 6247  from the other direction about 2 seconds after Train\
  \ 6250 had \nderai led and stopped was unfortunate timing ; a few minutes later\
  \ and the derailment could \nhave been reported and all other trains stopped.  Communication\
  \ after an accident is \ntherefore important.  The report discusses this issue in\
  \ respect of train design and e mergency \npreparedness.  \n4.1.4.  None of the\
  \ passengers and crew w as seriously injured in the collision.  The report discusses\
  \ \nwhy that was, but also discusses the crashworthiness of the Ganz trains and\
  \ how that might \nbe enhanced to improve safety for passengers and  crew in future.\
  \  \n4.1.5.  The emergency response to any accident can affect the outcome.  Nobody\
  \ was seriously \ninjured in this accident; nevertheless, under different circumstances\
  \ they could have been , so \nthe inquiry looked into this aspect in some detail.\
  \  Some o f this detail has been included in the \nfactual section of this report.\
  \  It is unlikely that any 2 emergency responses will be identical , so \ninevitably\
  \ there will be lessons to take away from every response.  The Commission has found\
  \ \nthat in this case the emergency response was effective and well-co-ordinated\
  \ , and that any \nlessons were  identified in the debrief that followed.  \nFinding\
  \ : \nThe emergency response to the accident was effective and generally well-co-ordinated\
  \ .  \nImprovements were identified in the subsequent emergency response debrief\
  \ for \ninclusion in the relevant emergency response plans.  \n4.2. Evaluating risk\
  \ of the  landslide  \n4.2.1.  An ex amination of historical aerial photographs\
  \ and records confirmed that this event was not \nthe first landslide to occur within\
  \ the cutting.  Indeed , KiwiRail had taken into account such \nhistorical events\
  \ when assessing the slope stability and assigning a slope rating to the cutting.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  The fundamental question to ask was: why did the landslide event occur\
  \ on this particular day \nand not during previous periods of heavy rainfall?  There\
  \ were several factors that could have \ncontributed.  Based on KiwiRail's geotech\
  \ nical assessment , the most likely causes were a \ncombination of the following:\
  \  \n the relative steep angle of the cut slope for the material  types  \n the\
  \ moderately high rainfall throughout the day combined with the highest April \n\
  to September cumulative rainfall recorded in the previous 20 years    \n \nReport\
  \ 10 -102 \n<< Page 15 >>\n \n the local groundwater flow collecting and being trapped\
  \ in a localised \ndepression formed wher e the relatively free -draining sand/silt\
  \ surface material  \nwas in contact with the underlying clay-dominated weathered\
  \ rock . \n4.2.3.  When taking into account previously reported landslide events\
  \ within the cutting, this \nlandslide was likely to have been a reactivation of\
  \ an existing flow feature rather than a new \nevent.   \n4.2.4.  In the 2 years\
  \ leading up to the collision , KiwiRail  had adopted a system atic approach with\
  \ its \nassessment and rat ing of slopes adjacent to the corridor to identify those\
  \ slopes within the \nWellington metro area where there was a risk of slope failure\
  \  that could affect the safe \nrunning of trains .  It used  a points -based system\
  \ : the higher the rating , the higher the level of \nrisk.   \n4.2.5.  When the\
  \ cutting where the landslide occurred was rated  there were 30 slopes within the\
  \ \nWellington metro network  that had been  assessed with a higher rating .  Since\
  \ then KiwiRail \neither has implemented mitigation strategies or has work currently\
  \ underway on 15 of the \nhigher -rated sites.   \n4.2.6.  As a result of this accident\
  \ KiwiRail has  given some priority to  the 324 m long cutting wher e \nthe landslide\
  \ occurred, and remedial work is well underway to stabilise the slope, which \n\
  mean s the Commission has not needed to make a recommendation for it to do so. \
  \ \n4.3. Operational response to risk of the landslide  \n4.3.1.  When the network\
  \ control manager informed  the area manager of the severe weather \nwarning, the\
  \ KiwiRail process made it the area manager's responsibility to determine whether\
  \ \na special inspection was required anywhere within his area.  On this occasion\
  \ the area \nmanager was told at 1625 the day bef ore the predicted rain.  The area\
  \ manager did send the \ninformation to his track staff, but instead of making any\
  \ decision himself, he left it to the \nindividual track gangers to decide for the\
  \ respective sections of track they maintained.  Some \ndecided to m ake special\
  \ inspection s, but not the ganger in charge of the section of track \nbetween Plimmerton\
  \ and Pukerua Bay where the landslide occurred.   \n4.3.2.  Given that the location\
  \ where the accident happened was listed as an \"essential feature \" \nbecause\
  \ of previous lan dslides that had occurred there, a special inspection should have\
  \ \nbeen called for and that decision should have come from the area manager in\
  \ consultation \nwith the section ganger.  That does not mean that the derailment\
  \ would have been prevented \nhad one be en carried out, but it might  have  resulted\
  \ i n a temporary speed restriction, which \nwould have reduced the risk . \n4.3.3.\
  \  The network control manager did not send any of the updates to the severe weather\
  \ warning \nto the area manager as he should have done.  Whether this would have\
  \ changed the area \nmanager's response is a matter of conjecture, but it would\
  \ have reinforced to him that the \nsevere weather warning was real and was specifically\
  \ targeted at his area of responsibility.  \n4.3.4.  The landslide occurred some\
  \ time within the 28 minutes before the arrival of Train 6250.  We \nknow this because\
  \ 2 other trains had crossed in the area 28 minutes before the accident \nhappened.\
  \  T he 2 train drivers might not necessarily have notice d any precursor to a landslide\
  \ \nas their trains pass ed the cutting, but a properly trained inspector who knew\
  \  what to look for \nand knew  that the cutting was on the essential features list\
  \ might have at least picked up \nsigns of a pending landslide.  In that case a\
  \ speed restriction could have been put in pla ce or \nthe site closely monitored,\
  \ or both .  For example, a 5 km long temporary speed restriction was \nin place\
  \ between Upper and Maymorn on the same day following a special track inspection.\
  \    \n4.3.5.  A speed restriction would probably not have prevented Train 625 0\
  \ striking the landslide \nbecause of the limited view the driver had of the track\
  \ ahead.  A slower speed , however , might \nhave resulted in less displacement\
  \ from the track when the train derailed, which would have \nlessened the impact\
  \ of the collision.  \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Report 10 -102 4.3.6.  More i mportantly\
  \ however, Train 6247 coming from the opposite direction would also have \nbeen\
  \ travelling at a reduced speed .  The driver of this train had an almost 500  m\
  \ sighting \ndistance to the derailed train ahead of him.  The National Rail System\
  \ Standard (Se ction 6) \nrequired Ganz trains travelling at 100 km/h to stop within\
  \ 460 m on flat and level track, even \nin wet conditions.  Even though Train 6247\
  \ was travelling down a 1 in 57 gradient , it is highly \nlikely that the driver\
  \ would have been able to stop his train within the clear distance ahead.  A \n\
  speed restriction therefore would have created 2 opportunities to either prevent\
  \ or minimise \nthe seriousness of this collision.  \n4.3.7.  KiwiRail 's Rule 6\
  \ require d the network control manager to arrange for the special cond itions in\
  \ \nthe speed restriction system to be updated when MetService  issue d a severe\
  \ weather \nwarning.  \n4.3.8.  At the time of the derailment there was a severe\
  \ weather warning in place that covered the \nWellington metro network.  KiwiRail's\
  \ network control centre had first received a warning from \nMetService  at 1016\
  \ the previous day (Wednesday 29 September) , forecasting 70 mm to  \n120 mm of\
  \ rain to fall  in the Wellington metro area from Thursday morning to early Friday\
  \ .   \n4.3.9.  Later on that same day the network control ma nager had added the\
  \ severe weather warning \ncondition status to the speed restriction system effective\
  \ from 0900 the next day.  This action \nshould have sent an auto -print command\
  \  to the printer in the Tranz Metro operations office.  \nHowever, the automatic\
  \ p rinting of the pending restrictions did not occur  because of the \nsoftware\
  \ problem . This system error could have been avoided had complete end -to-end testing\
  \ \nbeen undertaken when changes were made to the software.   \n4.3.10.  At 2100\
  \ that day  the network control manager received an update d MetService severe \n\
  weather warning  and a t 2115  updated  the condition status within the speed restriction\
  \ \nsystem  to bring forward the start time for the severe weather warning period\
  \ to 2100 .  Again , \nthe updat e failed to create an auto -print command to the\
  \ Tranz Metro operations office \nprinter.  \n4.3.11.  Because the automatic print\
  \ function failed to operate, no drivers of the passenger trains were \naware that\
  \ a severe weather warning had been issued.  This situation is concerning but is\
  \ not \nlikely to have affected the outcome of this accident.  It was the fact that\
  \ a speed restriction \nhad not been put in place for the area of the cutting that\
  \ is more concerning.  When a speed \nrestriction is put in place, speed boards\
  \ are  placed before the affected area and train drivers \nalready on the network\
  \ are verbally informed by train control.  \n4.3.12.  Commission inquiry 06 -108\
  \ reported on an incident in which passenger Train 9328 travelling \nfrom Wellington\
  \ to Johnsonville struck a slip and d erailed.  At the time, MetService had issued\
  \ \na severe weather warning but the network control manager had yet to promulgate\
  \ the \nwarning.  \n4.3.13.  The Commission identified the lack of effective severe/adverse\
  \ weather forecasting and real -\ntime monitoring of rainfall  in the Johnsonville\
  \ Line and other areas as a safety issue .  The \nCommission recommended that the\
  \ Director of the NZ Transport Agency  address th at safety \nissue.  \n4.3.14.\
  \  During 2011 KiwiRail established a series of rainfall monitoring sites within\
  \ the Wellington \nmetro  network where there was a high risk of landslide failure.\
  \  The forecast rainfall could  \nthen be reconciled with real -time gauge data\
  \  and responsive action taken . The Commission \nclosed its recommendation \"acceptable\"\
  \ based on that follow -up action .  An interim decision -\nmaking  matrix has now\
  \ been developed to facilitate decision -making  in the event of either \nforecast\
  \ high -intensity rainfall or actual rainfall recorded during the previous  28 days.\
  \   This \nmatrix is shown below.  \n  \n \nReport 10 -102 \n<< Page 17 >>\n Rainfall\
  \ forecast for \nthe n ext  \n24 hours  Rainfall recorded during \npreceding 4 -week\
  \ period   Rainfall recorded during \npreceding 4 -week period  \n < 150 mm  > 150\
  \ mm  \n< 25 mm  Condition 0: Normal operation  Condition 1: General warning  \n\
  25-50 mm  Condition 2: General warning  Condition 3: Track inspection  \n50-75 mm\
  \  Condition 4: Track inspection  Condition 5: Track inspection \nand 40 km/h speed\
  \ restriction  \n> 75 mm  Condition 6: Track inspection \nand 40 km/h speed restriction\
  \  Condition 7: Track inspection \nand 25 km/h speed restric tion \n General warning\
  \ : Notification to line managers of elevated risk due to either \n    saturation\
  \ of soils or a specific predicted event  \n Track inspection:  Periodic track inspection\
  \ s in areas of elevated risk. The  \n    frequency and location s of inspections\
  \ will depend on the \n    geotechnical hazard , train schedule and severity of\
  \ the event  \n Speed restriction:  Graduated speed restrictions depending on the\
  \ risk level and \n    location  \n Stop train movements:  This action would be\
  \ a direct response t o a reported event.   \nHad the interim decision -making \
  \ matrix been operational at  the time of this accident, a special \ntrack inspection\
  \ would have been required and the maximum permitted line speed reduced to \n25\
  \ km/h . \nFindings : \nA 25 km/h temporary train spe ed restriction would  likely\
  \ have prevented Train 6247 \ncolliding with the stationary derailed Train 6250.\
  \  \nA 25 km/h temporary train speed restriction might  not have allowed the driver\
  \ of  \nTrain 6250 to stop the train short of the landslide debris , but it wou\
  \ ld have reduced the \nrisk of a derailment and the subsequent collision.  \nThe\
  \ location of the landslide where the derailment and collision happened was prone\
  \ to \nlandslides during periods of heavy rain and ground saturation.  Given the\
  \ predicted \nrainfall for t he area , and that the location was on the essential\
  \ features list, a special \ntrack inspection should have been made and a speed\
  \ restriction should have been put in \nplace.  \nKiwiRail's  slope ranking system\
  \ for evaluating the landslide risk on the rail network was \nan effective tool\
  \ for prioritising remedial work at locations that were prone to landslides . \n\
  However,  KiwiRail had not conduct ed a complete risk assessment for each identified\
  \ \nlocation to identify what action could be taken to reduce the risk in the meantime,\
  \ such as \nmonitoring rainfall, applying temporary speed restrictions and conducting\
  \ special track \ninspections.  \n \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Report 10 -102 The KiwiRail\
  \ rainfall monitoring system and risk management framework put in place \nsince\
  \ the accident, which  includes information from the slope ranking system , is a\
  \ more \neffective tool for managing the risk of landslides . \n  \n4.4. Communication\
  \  \n4.4.1.  Radio communication is an important component of a safe rail operation.\
  \  The National Rail \nSystem Standard required all locomotives and self -propelled\
  \ rail vehicles to be fitted with \nradio equipment capable of transmi tting communi\
  \ cation s to, and receiving communication s \nfrom, train controllers and other\
  \ rail vehicles on the networ k.  \n4.4.2.  For a single -person train operation\
  \ on the rail network, the lead motive power unit must be \nfitted with a very-high-frequency\
  \ E -band radio  equipped with at least 4 channels.  Channel 1 is \ndedicated to\
  \ short -range communication , including to a driver on a different train, a signal\
  \ box \ncontroller and train examination and maintenance personnel.   \n4.4.3. \
  \ The Standard required the driving cabs of all rail vehicles to be equipped with\
  \ vigilance \nsystem s to monitor driver alertness by requiri ng the driver s to\
  \ respond to indicator lights \nand/or audible warning devices within a maximum\
  \ period of 70 seconds.   \n4.4.4.  The vigilance cycle is reset when the driver\
  \ presses the vigilance cancellation button , makes a \nchange to either the air\
  \ brake or throttle  control setting or sound s the whistle.  If the vigilance \n\
  system is not cancelled by the driver within 10 seconds of the in -cab alarm sounding,\
  \ the air \nbrake is applied automatically and the train is stopped and an alert\
  \ sent to train control.  \n4.4.5.  Brake pipe p ressure is monitored continuously\
  \ and when a sudden reduction of air pressure \nfrom 550 kilopascals to 350 kilopascals\
  \ in less than 10 seconds is detected , such as when an \nemergency brake application\
  \ is made, the vigilance system automatically sends an emer gency \nvigilance alarm\
  \  to train control through the radio system.  When the alarm activates , the \n\
  scanner sends the alarm signal until train control acknowledges by calling the driver.\
  \  The \nalarm sequence is repeated every 30 seconds, up to 30 times.  For th is\
  \ to occur the radio \nmust be capable of \"selective calling \" (selcall).  \n\
  4.4.6.  When receiving an emergency alarm , the train controller is required to\
  \ contact the driver \nimmediately to determine the reason for the activation. \
  \ Should the first attempt be \nunsuccess ful, the train controller is required\
  \ to make further calls during the next 2 minutes.  \nIf there is still no response,\
  \ the train controller is required to send a person to the train to find \nout what\
  \ caused the alarm activation.  \n4.4.7.  At the time the Ganz fleet w as commissioned,\
  \ selcall radios were not available.  When they did \nbecome available  later ,\
  \ they were fitted to main  line locomotives as a safety precaution when \nthe \"\
  second  person \" was removed from locomotive -hauled freight trains in 1987.  KiwiRail's\
  \  \npredecessors determined that the operation of the passenger trains on the Wellington\
  \ \ncommuter network was not a single -person operation because the passenger train\
  \  had a crew \nof at least 2 people, namely  a driver and a train manager , plus\
  \ passenger operat ors \ndepending on the number of passenger cars on a train. \
  \ The consequence of this was that the \nradio system fitted to the fleet of Ganz\
  \ units did not have a selcall capability.  Therefore \ndespite emergency brake\
  \ applications having been made on Train 6250  and Train 6247 \nbefore the collision,\
  \ train control did not and could not receive the a lerts automatically.   \n4.4.8.\
  \  The Tranzlog event recorder s from the leading and trailing ends of  Train 6247\
  \ shut down  0.6 \nseconds after the collision.  The driving compartment on EM1223\
  \  was damaged to such an \nextent that the train radio equipment was unusable ,\
  \ and because the battery supply failed, all \nelectrical power was lost throughout\
  \ the train.  With no electrical power, the radio equipment \nin the undamaged \
  \ driver's cab at the trailing end  was also unusable.   \n  \n \nReport 10 -102\
  \ \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.4.9.  The absence of selcall capability on the Wellington\
  \ passenger fleet meant there was a delay in \ntrain control being made aware of\
  \ the collision and in turn calling the emergency services.  In \nthis case the\
  \ next train coming from the opposite direction arrived  at about the same time\
  \ that \nthe derailment occurred.  In other circumstances a delay in train control\
  \ becoming aware of \nsuch an event in double -track territory is a lost opportunity\
  \ to warn  other trains in the vicinity.  \nThe delay can be overcome by fitting\
  \ an improved radio system with selcall capability to the \nWellington commuter\
  \ rail fleet .  A recommendation has been made to address th is issue.  \nFindings\
  \ : \nMost of the passenger trains in th e Wellington commuter fleet are not equipped\
  \ with \nselcall -capable radio equipment, which means that in the event of an emergency\
  \ brake \napplication or other event that causes a rapid reduction in air brake\
  \ pipe pressure , there \ncould be a critical delay in train control being alerted\
  \ in time to prevent the event \nescalating . \n \n4.5. Crashworthiness  \n4.5.1.\
  \  Crashworthiness is a term used to describe a vehicle 's ability to absorb impact\
  \ forces  and \nprotect the occupants from serious injury .  The leading passenger\
  \ vehicle of n orthbound Train \n6250 hit the landslide material, derailed and 2\
  \ seconds after stopping  was struck by \nsouthbound Train 6247 , travelling at\
  \ 54 km/h on the adjacent line.  Train 6247 stopped  \nabout 77 m past the initial\
  \ point of impact  and remained on the trac k. \n4.5.2.  The driving compartment\
  \ s of both trains were  severely deformed during the collision \nsequence , with\
  \ significant loss of what is known as driver surviva ble space.  Had both drivers\
  \ \nnot evacuate d their driving position s, they would likely have been at leas\
  \ t seriously injured . \n4.5.3.  When commissioned  nearly 30 years ago , the Ganz\
  \ train was considered to be a well-designed  \nand well-built vehicle with appropriate\
  \ crashworthiness features  for the time .  However, w hen \ncompared with current\
  \ design standards , the Ganz units lack the same structural energy \nabsorption\
  \ at the corner and end posts, and do  not have the same \" anti-climb \" features\
  \ . \nCorner posts and end posts either side of the central end door are an integral\
  \ part of modern \npassenger vehicle design .  The purpo se of corner posts is to\
  \ deflect corner impacts and \ncontain damage to energy -absorbing deformation.\
  \  These c orner posts are particularly \nimportant on these vehicles where  the\
  \ driver position is offset to  the right , which means the \ndriver is closer to\
  \  trains approaching on the adjacent main line.  Additionally, because the \ncommuter\
  \ network is also used by freight trains , the corner post  helps  to protect the\
  \ driver \nfrom  any overhanging  load on a passing train . \n4.5.4.  At the time\
  \ of the collision both trains we re lightly loaded with all passengers seated.\
  \ None of \nthe passengers suffered serious injury . \n4.5.5.  Since the collision,\
  \ i mprovements to the rupture resistance of the Ganz fleet have been \nrecommended\
  \ to be included as part of the scope for any future refurbishme nts.  These would\
  \ \ninclude the  fitting of an \"end mask \". \n4.5.6.  The anti -climb feature\
  \ that is typically found on modern passenger cars provide s some \nprotection against\
  \ over -riding, considered by the industry to be the most dangerous accident \n\
  scenario.  These features have been present  on the New Zealand locomotive fleet\
  \ since the \n1980s and on the SD driving trailer cars used on the diesel -hauled\
  \ , push/pull commuter trains \nthat have been operating on the Auckland com muter\
  \ rail network since 2004.   They also \nfeature on the newer Matangi fleet introduced\
  \ to the Wellington network in 2011.  \n  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Report 10 -102\
  \ 4.5.7.  While it might not be economically feasible to modify the older fleet\
  \ to meet the \ncrashworthiness standards of modern trains, project s such as trialling\
  \ end masks on the Ganz \nfleet, installing anti -climb devices and restoring structural\
  \ attachment points to original or \nbetter standards should be included in any\
  \ future upgrade if the fleet is to remain in service \nfor any appreciable leng\
  \ th of time.   A recommendation has been made to address this safety \nissue. \
  \ \nFindings : \nThe driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during\
  \ the collision \nsequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their\
  \ driving positions befor e \nimpact they would likely have been fatally  injured.\
  \  \nThe Ganz  trains were generally strong  and well-built and had met the crashworthiness\
  \ \nstandards at the time of build some 30 years earlier , but they did not perform\
  \ as  well as  a \nmodern train during a similar front -end collision , thereby\
  \ increasing the risk of injury to \nthe driver s and possibly passengers seated\
  \ near the ends of the train s. \n \nReport 10 -102 \n<< Page 21 >>"
