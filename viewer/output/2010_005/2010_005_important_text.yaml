  \ pilots of the aeroplane , who were co nduct ing an \noverhead circuit joining\
  \ procedure , descended through the downwind leg of the circuit of the \nhelicopter\
  \ , which  was established in a  non-standard circuit fo r the same runway.  The\
  \ pilots of  \nboth aircraft had been cleared by ATC f or their respective procedures\
  \ , and they and the \ncontroller had recognised  that th e aeroplane 's descent\
  \  could  conflict with the helicopter 's \ncircuit . \n4.2. The controlle r issued\
  \ the clearance to the aeroplane after its  pilots said they had the  \nhelicopter\
  \ in sight .  Within Class D airspace  such as th e New Plymouth control zone, \n\
  separation was not applied by ATC between VFR aircraft , therefore each pilot-in-command\
  \ was \nresponsible for seeing and avoiding the other  aircraft .  The situation\
  \ increase d the risk of a \ncollision , but there was an expectation that the risk\
  \ would be mitigated by the aeroplane p ilots \nperforming the joining procedure\
  \ safely  and all of the pilots exercising an effective lookout . \n4.3. However,\
  \ both of the aeroplane pilots lost sight of the helicopter before beginning the\
  \ descent  \nand continued with  the procedure with out advising each other or ATC.\
  \  The helicopter pilots \nwere unable to look for the aeroplane until they were\
  \ on the cross wind leg of their circu it, and \nthe controller  had not specifically\
  \ advise d them that the aeroplane was relevant traffic.  \n4.4. This incident occurred\
  \ at a  controlled aerodrome, and although no collision resulted, some of \nthe\
  \ circumstances were similar to those of the collision  at the uncontrolled Paraparaumu\
  \  \nAerodrome  in 2008 .  After that accident, the Commission made r ecommendations\
  \  that were \nintended to prevent a recurrence .  However, the present  investigation\
  \ found that t he aviation \ncommunity , from regulator to operators,  had not acted\
  \ in concert or consistently to reduc e the \nmid-air collision risk at aerodromes\
  \ . \n4.5. The following  safety issues were identified and are discussed more fully\
  \ below:  \n the simultaneous use of opposed  circuits  \n the correct interpretation\
  \ of the overhead circu it joining procedure.  \n4.6. The following factors are\
  \ also discussed:  \n the limitations of the see -and-avoid principle for collision\
  \ avoidance  \n pilots' understanding of the ATC services provided to VFR aircraft.\
  \  \n4.7. Environmental and aircraft factors were relevant only to the extent that\
  \ they affected the \nconspicuity of the helicopter and hence the effectiveness\
  \ of the see -and-avoid principle.  \nSimultaneous opposed  circuits  \n4.8. Apart\
  \ from the passenger aeroplane that had l anded, the helicopter  and the training\
  \ \naeroplane  were the only 2 aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome.  The controller\
  \ expected \nthat the aeroplane  would fly a le ft-hand pattern to runway 14, which\
  \  he recognised  could lead \nto a conflict with the helicopter .  The controller\
  \  mitigated thi s risk to some extent by informing \nthe aeroplane pilots  that\
  \ the helicopter was in a right -hand circuit and asking the pilots if they \nhad\
  \ it in sight before he cleared them f or the joining procedure .  Although not\
  \ s pecifically \nstated, t he traffic information  was intended to  caution t he\
  \ pilots  of the aeroplane  that a \ndescent on the \u2017non-traffic ' side of\
  \ the left-hand circuit would pass through the altitude and \ndownwind leg of the\
  \ helicopter's circuit.  \n4.9. After passing th e traffic information to the aeroplane\
  \ pilots, t he controller could have avoided \nthe identified potential conflict\
  \ had he instructed them to \u2017pass behind the helicopter ', or \ninstructed\
  \ them  to join for a right -hand circuit, a variation with which  a student  pilot\
  \ about to \nsit their flight test should have easily coped.  \n4.10.  However,\
  \ after the aeroplane pilots reported that the helicopter  was in sight, the weight\
  \ of \nresponsibility for collision avoidance shifted from the controller to them\
  \ .  If the helicopter \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Report 10 -005    pilots had sighted\
  \ the aeroplane  early enough , the collision risk should have  reduce d further\
  \ , \nbut they did not see it until a collision nearly  occurred.  \n4.11.  The\
  \ instructor in the aeroplane  said he would not have flown a circuit opposed to\
  \ that of the \nprecedin g traffic if he had be en at an uncontrolled aerodrome\
  \ .  However, compliance with Civil \nAviation Rule  91.2 23 was required at uncontrolled\
  \ and controlled aerodromes.   Therefore, it \nappeared that the instructor's instinct\
  \ to reduc e the collision risk was overridden by his \nunderstanding of how  to\
  \ comply with the clear ance for the standard joining procedure.  \n4.12.  The incident\
  \ drew attention to what should be an obvious threat: a situation of simultaneous\
  \ \nopposed circuits means there is no \u2017non -traffic side' for a joi ning aircraft\
  \ to descend to circuit \naltitude, which increases the risk of collision.  While\
  \ controllers need to have the flexibility to \ndirect a specific aircraft to operate\
  \ contrary to a published circuit, they should not do so if that \ncreates a n unmanageable\
  \  risk of collision, and a ll affected  pilots should be  aware of such an \nabnormal\
  \ situation .  Unless a controller is providing  separation , the situations when\
  \ an aircraft \ncan be safely cleared to perform an opposed circuit will be limited\
  \ . \nFindin g  \nThe controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace,\
  \ but he did not manage \nthe increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane\
  \ descending to circuit \naltitude in the opposite direction . \n \n4.13.  That\
  \ such a situation could be \u2017set up' at a controlled aerodrome suggested that\
  \ the lessons \nof the Paraparaumu accident  in 2008  had not been understood by\
  \ all pilots and controllers .  \nAfter the Paraparaumu accident , the Director\
  \ indicated that he would encourage the formation \nof aerodrome user groups and\
  \ expect them to develop local procedures to minimis e the risk of \ncollisions.\
  \  Ironically , it was a user group that developed a local procedure incorporating\
  \ \nopposed circuits that were a factor in the incident at Palmerston North in October\
  \ 2010 . \n4.14.  The Commission's recommendations after the Paraparaumu accident\
  \ might have been \ninterpreted by some industry participants as applying to uncontrolled\
  \ aerodromes  only.  \nHowever, the role of ATC in the New Plymou th incident and\
  \ the industry cross -section that was \ninvolved in formulating the Palmerston\
  \ North user group procedures suggested t hat the \naviation community ha d not\
  \ fully understood  or taken effective action at all aerodromes to \nremove , or\
  \ at least reduce,  the co llision risk associated with opposed circuits . \n4.15.\
  \  In September 2009 , the CAA advised the Commission that it had not identified\
  \ any safety \nissues as sociated with opposed circuits as  long as pilots complied\
  \ with the Civil Aviation Rule s \nand the aerodrome  operational conditions . \
  \ In a submission made to the Commission during \nthe present inquiry, the CAA stated\
  \  its preference for aerodrome operators to take more \nresponsib ility for assessing\
  \ and mitigating the operational risks at their aerodromes , rather \nthan have\
  \ the CAA intervene.  The use of  opposed  circuits to segregate a mix of aircraft\
  \ types \nor activities  was one such risk to be managed .  This preference of the\
  \ CAA was in line with the  \nproposed amendment to Civil Aviation Rule s Part 139\
  \ .  In the interim, t he CAA has worked \nwith some aerodrome operators and Airways\
  \  to mitigate identified risks (see  section 6.2 ). \nFinding  \nThe aviation community,\
  \ including  the regulator , Airways, aerodrome operators and \naircraft  operators,\
  \ does not have a con sistent approach to reducing the collision risk s \nassociated\
  \ with simultaneous opposed circuits at aerodromes.  \n4.16.  The requirements of\
  \ sub -sections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of Civil Aviation Rule  91.2 23 could be read\
  \ \nas conflict ing, when applied to the circumstances  of th e New Plymouth  incident.\
  \  The rule \nstated, in part:  \n  \n  Report 10 -005 \n<< Page 17 >>\n (a) Except\
  \ as provided in paragraph (b), a pilot of an aeroplane operating on or in the \
  \ \nvicinity of an aerodrome must \u2014 \n(1) observe other aerodrome traffic for\
  \ the purpo se of avoiding a collision; \nand \n(2) unless otherwise authorised\
  \ or instructed by ATC, conform with or avoid \nthe aerodrome traffic circuit formed\
  \ by other aircraft; and  \n(3) perform  a left -hand aerodrome traffic circuit\
  \ when approaching for a \nlanding at and after take -off from an aerodrome that\
  \ is  published in the \n[Aeronautical Information Publication] NZ unless \u2014\
  \ \n    (i) the pilot is otherwise authorised or instruc ted by ATC; or...  \n4.17.\
  \  As the controller had not instruct ed the aeroplane  to fly a different circuit\
  \ from that of  the \nhelicopter , its pilots would seem to have been required by\
  \ (a)(2)  to fly the same right-hand \ncircuit  as the helicopter  (or remain clear\
  \ ), but (a)(3) also appeare d to require them to fly the \npublished left-hand\
  \ circuit  for runway 14 . \n4.18.  Specialist ATC staff of the CAA and Airways\
  \  advised that a non-standard circuit required  a \nspecific clearance,  so in\
  \ their view the pilots of the aeroplane  were correct in joining for the \npublished\
  \  left-hand circuit, in a ccordance with sub -section (a)(3 ).  As a left-hand\
  \ circuit did not \nconform with th at of the helicopter , the pilots of the aeroplane\
  \  were therefore obliged by sub -\nsection (a)( 2) to avoid the helicopter' s circuit.\
  \  In pra ctice, th ey might  have achieve d that by \njudging  carefull y the timing\
  \ and flight path of the ir descen t from 2000 ft  to the circuit altitude . \n\
  4.19.  Although Civil Aviation Rule  91.223(a)(2) reflected the corresponding ICAO\
  \ standard  and the \ninvolved persons in the New Plymouth incident had the same\
  \ expectation of which way the \naeroplane  would turn, the correct applica tion\
  \ of the  rule to a situation like that, in which the \naircraft ahead was flying\
  \ a non -standard circuit, was un clear .  The ATC specialists disagreed, \nnoting\
  \ that the controller  had not given specific alternative instructions to the aeroplane\
  \ .  \nHowever, i f an ATC presence was required to understand  the rule, the rule\
  \ was less likely to be \napplied correctly at an uncontrolled aerodrome .  An u\
  \ nclear rule for right-of-way procedures \nand collision avoidance w as a safet\
  \ y issue that needed  address ing. \nFinding  \nCivil Aviation Rule 91.22 3 can\
  \ be interpreted ambiguously  in non -standard traffic \nsituations , which could\
  \ contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes.  \nThe o verhead  circuit  joining\
  \ procedure  \n4.20.  Although ATC c ould instruct an aircraft to join a circuit\
  \ via the overhead procedure in order to \nestablish or maintain a traffic sequence,\
  \ the procedure was c arried out more often at \nuncontrolled aerodromes.  The pilots\
  \ of the aeroplane  requested the procedure to practi se \nwhat the s tudent  would\
  \ likely be required to demonstrate on his flight test .  New Plymouth \nAerodrome\
  \ was controlled at the time  of the incident and the pilots had been listening\
  \ to the \ntower frequ ency , so they knew the conditions and traffic before reaching\
  \ the overhead .  The \nbenefit s of the practi ce were primarily in the student\
  \ sighting the traffic and flying the correct \npattern.  \n4.21.  The Aeronautical\
  \ Information Publication 's description of the stand ard overhead joining \nprocedure\
  \ required a pilot, having determined the runway in use, to \u2017make all subsequent\
  \ \nturns in the direction of the traffic circuit ' (Aeronautical Information Publication\
  \ , p.AD1.5 -4) \n[emphasis added] .  There was potential for the direction of the\
  \ joining procedure to be \nmistaken  because of the subtle distinction between\
  \ the direction of the traffic circuit , which \nimplied preceding traffic, and\
  \ th e general circuit procedure of making all turns \u2017in the direction \nappropriate\
  \ to the ru nway in use ' [emphasis added] .  When there was preceding traffic,\
  \ Civil \nAviation Rule  91.2 23 required the joining aircraft to conform with or\
  \ avoid the established \ncircuit , but the rule did not address  the possibility\
  \ of the preceding aircraft being in a non-\nstandard circuit . \n \n\n<< Page 18\
  \ >>\n Report 10 -005    4.22.  The di fferent interpretations of required turn\
  \ direction are shown by the controller and the \ninvolved pilots expecting the\
  \ aeroplane  to join for the left-hand circuit , appropriate to t he \nrunway  in\
  \ use, while the direction of the traffic circuit  flown by the helicopter  was\
  \ right -hand .  \nSpecialist ATC staff of the CAA insisted that the correct interpretation\
  \ of the joining procedure \nwas that the runway in use was determined by the pilot\
  \ of the first aircraft to arrive, or by ATC, \nand the circuit direction was then\
  \ that published for the chosen runway .  At a controlled \naerodrome, specific\
  \ clearance was required for an aircraft to fly a non -standard circuit.  \nTherefore,\
  \ the specialists advised, as the helicopter  was operating in the ru nway 14 circuit,\
  \ \nthe correct circuit direction for the aeroplane  was left -hand, unless cleared\
  \ otherwise by ATC . \n4.23.  The pilot of a n aircraft joining from overhead need\
  \ s to identify the  non-traffic side of the circuit \nso th at th e descent to\
  \ circuit altitude c an be acc omplished safely.  As an aircraft joins a circuit\
  \  \nbefore operating in the circuit, it could be argued that  if the traffic conditions\
  \ cause a conflict , \nthe joining requirement to \u2017make all subsequent turns\
  \ in the direction of the traffic circuit'  \nshould have precedence  over the general\
  \ circuit procedure of making all turns in the direction \nappropriate to the runway\
  \ in use .  At New Plymouth, had the pilots of the aeroplane  advised \nthat they\
  \ would follow the helicopter  and join for a  right -hand circu it, or had they\
  \ requested or \nbeen instructed to do so, the potential conflict that th ey all\
  \ recognised  likely would have been \neliminated . \n4.24.  Discussion s with some\
  \ very experienced flight instructors confirmed different opinion s \nregarding\
  \ the correct way to join in  circumstances like those of this incident.  The lack\
  \ of \nagreement could be due to the Aeronautical Information Publication  and Civil\
  \ Aviation Rule  \ninterpretations noted earlier , but the CAA Flight Instructor\
  \ 's Guide was clear in stating that the \ncircuit direction for a joining aircraft\
  \ was th e same as that  being flown by an aircraft already i n \na circuit , and\
  \ that the aircraft ahead had priority.  The CAA had discussed the overhead joining\
  \ \nprocedure in a Vector  article (C AA, 2010b, p.15), but as there were continuing\
  \ \nmisunderstandings in regard to a common flight manoeuvre, which ha s been implicated\
  \ in \ncollisions, the relevant Civil Aviation Rule  and references in the Aeronautical\
  \ Information \nPublication  and Flight Instruc tor's Guide should be clarified\
  \ . \nFinding  \nThe descriptions of and requirements for the standard overhead\
  \ circuit joining \nprocedure that are published in Civil Aviation Rule s, the Aeronautical\
  \ Information \nPublication  and the Flight Instructor 's Guide can be  misinterpreted\
  \ or misapplied in \nnon-standard traffic situations .  This could contribute to\
  \ the collision risk at \naerodromes.  \n \nThe see -and-avoid principle  \n4.25.\
  \  The controller and instructors of both aircraft realised  that the aeroplane\
  \ , in joining overhead \nfor a left -hand circuit , might conflict with the helicopter\
  \  operating in a right -hand circuit for the \nsame runway.  Reducing that risk\
  \ depended on the pilots of both aircraft applying the see-and-\navoid principle\
  \ and, in particular, the pilots of the aeropl ane keep ing the helicopter  in sight.\
  \  \n4.26.  Pilots should be taught from their earliest instructional flights how\
  \ to combine a thorough look -\nout with an attentive  radio  listen -out in order\
  \ to form an accurate understanding of the traffic \nsituation .  Pilots learnt\
  \  how to project the flight paths of other aircraft and to alternate looking \n\
  out for the traffic with the performing of essential activities within the cockpit,\
  \ such as \ncompleting checks.  If there was a heightened risk of collision, continuous\
  \ sighting of the \ntraffic was required.  \n4.27.  Pilots are assisted in looking\
  \ for traffic by receipt of traffic  information  from ATC , when an air \ntraffic\
  \ service is provided, combined with their own  continuous radio listening watch.\
  \   \nHowever, i n practice pilots tend  to var y the attention given to others'\
  \ transmissions , \nparticularly i f a transmission does not contain the pilot's\
  \ call -sign or if the y are engaged in \nflight instruction  or dealing with an\
  \ emergency.  \n  \n  Report 10 -005 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.28.  The Manual of Air\
  \ Traffic Services  described collision a voidance in Class D airspace as a \n\u2017\
  collaborative exercise' between ATC and pilots, but it also required controllers\
  \ to avoid conflict  \nsituations and to pass traffic information to all affected\
  \ aircraft.  The controller at New \nPlymouth expected the pilots o f the helicopter\
  \  to have overheard him when he advised their \nposition to the aeroplane .  However,\
  \ th e situation was one of  recognised potential conflict , and  \nmutual traffic\
  \ information  should have been passed.  Although the helicopter pilots started\
  \ \nlooking for the aeroplane as soon as they could,  it was unlikely, even with\
  \ specific advice,  that \nthey would have seen it any earlier.  \nFinding  \nThe\
  \ controller recognised the potential for a conflict, but he provided traffic \n\
  information to the pilots of the aeroplane only , and not to the pilots of the helicopter\
  \ . \n \n4.29.  The controller had provided a height buffer between the joining\
  \ aeroplane and the helicopter \ncircuit, and the aeroplane pilots should have maintained\
  \ that buffer until they were assured \nthat their descent would remain clear of\
  \ the helicopter.  They did not have to descend as soon \nas ATC had cleared them\
  \ for the procedure.  \n4.30.  The pilots of the aeroplane  reported seeing the\
  \ helicopter  when advised by ATC and when the \nhelicopter  was on the crosswind\
  \ leg of its circuit.   However, as the aeroplane  continued its left \nturn before\
  \ start ing the descent, the helicopter \u2017just disappeared'.  It was possible\
  \  that as the \n2 aircraft turned towards each other, there was a period of no\
  \ apparent relative motion .  \nMovement is one of the strongest cues for detecting\
  \ another aircraft.  Each aeroplane pilot \nshould have realised as soon as he lost\
  \ sight of the helicopt er that unless the other pilot still \nhad the helicopter\
  \ in sight,  it would not be  safe to descend .  However, they both lost sight of\
  \ it \nand did not tell each other, and commenced the descent.  \n4.31.  The lowered\
  \ wing of the aeroplane  would have obscured  the helico pter, which was flying\
  \ a \ncircuit pattern  much closer  to the runway than aeroplanes flew.  In addition,\
  \ the controller had \nasked the helicopter pilots to keep their circuit \u2017\
  tight', so  the aeroplane pilots, being unfamiliar \nwith helicopter circuit s anyway\
  \ , misjudged where to look to re -sight the helicopter . \nFinding  \nThe incident\
  \ would not have occurred had either of the aeroplane pilots stopped the \ndescent\
  \ when he lost sight of the helicopter.  \n4.32.  If a pilot was asked by ATC to\
  \ report sighting certain traffic before being cleared for a \nprocedure, it was\
  \ impli ed that the cleared pilot had to k eep the traffic in sight .  That was\
  \ an \nexplicit requirement under IFR, and if visual contact was lost with the aircraft\
  \ ahead, ATC had \nto be advised.  However , a VFR pilot is not explicitly required\
  \ to do so .  The instructor in the \naeroplane  did not ensure that he or his student\
  \ kept the helicopter  in sight during the joining \nmanoeuvre, even though he recognised\
  \ the increased risk of collision initially ; and when he \ndid lose  sight of the\
  \ helicopter , he mistook the spacing of the helicopter's downwind leg.  The \n\
  correct action would have been to advise ATC that the helicopter  was no longer\
  \ in sight  and to \nhave discontinued the descent . \nFinding  \nThe incident would\
  \  have  been less likely to occur had the aeroplane pilots \nimmediately broadcast\
  \ that they had lost sight of the helicopter.  \n4.33.  The aeroplane instructor's\
  \ unfamiliarity with the light helicopter circuit was likely due to the \nlow frequency\
  \ of helicopter training at the aerodr ome.  The aerodrome users might have been\
  \ \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Report 10 -005    more aware of helicopter characteristics\
  \ had the helicopter instructor joined the user group \nwhen he started business\
  \ and informed the group of his planned activity . \n4.34.  The planned establishment\
  \ of a new flight training business at an aerodrome was an example \nof a potential\
  \ change in risk profile that the CAA believed an aerodrome operator should \nidentify\
  \ and assess.  The involvement of aerodrome user groups in aeronautical s tudies\
  \ \nshould ensure greater awareness of planned changes and improved safety.  The\
  \ p roposed  \namendment to Civil Aviation Rule Part 139 w as intended to assist\
  \ the CAA and operators \ntowards that goal.       \nFinding  \nLocal aerodrome\
  \ user groups benefit their participants by providing information about \ntheir\
  \ respective activities.  Aerodrome operators , in order to manage their operational\
  \ \nrisks, should require  their relevant tenants and users to participate fully\
  \ in such \ngroups . \n4.35.  Once the aeroplane  and the helic opter  entered the\
  \ cone of invisibility above the tower, the \ncontroller w ould have been restricted\
  \ in his ability to  offer traffic avoidance advice, even if  the \naeroplane  pilots\
  \ had advised losing sight of the helicopter .  The potential for the controller\
  \ t o \nlose sight of the traffic would appear to be another reason to provide m\
  \ utual traffic \ninformation . \n4.36.  The see -and-avoid principle, in spite\
  \ of its well documented limitations, was effective  in \nprevent ing a collision\
  \ in this case .  The principle  remain s an essential tool for collision \navoidance,\
  \ particularly  where there is  low relative speed , but its application require\
  \ s pilots and \ncontrollers to seek, share and use the best available information\
  \ regarding other traffic . \n4.37.  Even for aircraft fitted with air borne collision\
  \ avoidance system s, the first action by the pilot s \non receipt of a \u2017traffic\
  \ advisory' is to try to sight the other traffic.  Furthermore, airborne \ncollisi\
  \ on avoidance systems do not generat e traffic advisor ies under some  conditions\
  \ , \nespecial ly at low heights,  therefore  pilots still  have to look for and\
  \ sight potentially conflicting \ntraffic.  \nFinding  \nThe see -and-avoid principle\
  \ continue s to have relevance, provided pilots and \ncontrollers counter its well-known\
  \  limitations by the appropriate sharing of traffic \ninformation.  \n \n  \n \
  \ \n  Report 10 -005 \n<< Page 21 >>\n Air traffic control of VFR aircraft  \n4.38.\
  \  At controlled aerodromes  in New Zealand , which were designated Class C or Class\
  \ D airspace, \nATC procedures for sequencing VFR traffic were formalised an d applied\
  \ with little variation . So \nit was not surprising that procedures that were intended\
  \ to achieve s afe operations and \nexpeditious traffic flow  often had the same\
  \ outcome as formal separation standards . \n4.39.  For example, by requiring the\
  \ aeroplane  to join overhead at 2000 ft, rather than the usual \n1600 ft  (which\
  \ was 500 ft above the circuit altitude), the controller created  a 500 ft buffer\
  \ \nbetween the aeroplane  and helicopter  circuit altitude s.  The pilot s of the\
  \ aeroplane  were \nrequired  to comply w ith the instruction , which separat ed\
  \ them  from the helicopter , until the y \nhad sighted the helicopter  and were\
  \ cleared for the joining procedure .  The controller called \nthis \u2017segregation'\
  \  rather than separation . \n4.40.  ATC does not separate  VFR aircraft9, apart\
  \ fr om runway and wake turbulence separation .  \nHowever , the involved instructors\
  \ were not alone in observing that ATC instructions often gave \nan impression of\
  \ being de facto  separation.  The CAA acknowledged this in a recent Vector  \n\
  article (CAA, 2010c, p.13 ) and in Advisory Circular 172 -2. \n4.41.  The aerop\
  \ lane instructor's comment that his  application of Civil Aviation Rule  91.2 23\
  \ \ndepended on whether ATC was in attendance  was a correct interpretation of the\
  \ rule,  to a \npoint .  However, the comment, and his not advisi ng ATC that visual\
  \ contact with the helicopter  \nhad been lost , might have re flected a misplaced\
  \ reliance on ATC and a misunderstanding  that \nan ATC instruction  to a VFR aircraft\
  \ meant se paration  was being applied . \n4.42.  The CAA has attempted , with an\
  \ article in Vector, to clarify pilots' understanding of the \nservices provided\
  \ to VFR traffic in different classes of airspace , and has taken action in \nconjunction\
  \ with Airways as described in section 6.2(b) . \nFinding  \nSome VFR pilots continue\
  \ to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in \nClass C and D airspace\
  \ as the provision of traffic separation.  \n  \n                              \
