- name: Simultaneous Opposed Circuits
  explanation: The simultaneous use of opposed circuits is a safety theme that was identified as a contributing factor in the incident. The controller expected the aeroplane to fly a left-hand pattern which could lead to a conflict with the helicopter's right-hand circuit. The controller mitigated this risk by informing the aeroplane pilots that the helicopter was in a right-hand circuit and asking if they had it in sight before clearing them for the joining procedure. However, the potential for conflict was not fully managed, as the controller did not instruct the aeroplane pilots to 'pass behind the helicopter' or to join for a right-hand circuit, which could have avoided the identified potential conflict (4.8-4.9). This theme is relevant because it highlights the risks associated with having aircraft operate in opposing traffic patterns without clear management of the associated collision risks.
- name: See-and-Avoid Principle
  explanation: The limitations of the see-and-avoid principle for collision avoidance is another safety theme. The incident depended on the pilots of both aircraft applying the see-and-avoid principle, especially the pilots of the aeroplane keeping the helicopter in sight. However, both aeroplane pilots lost sight of the helicopter and continued with the procedure without advising each other or ATC (4.25-4.30). This theme is relevant as it underscores the inherent limitations of relying solely on visual detection for collision avoidance, particularly when one aircraft loses sight of the other.
- name: ATC Traffic Information and Instructions
  explanation: Misinterpretation of ATC traffic information and instructions is a safety theme that played a role in the incident. The controller's instructions were valid for Class D airspace, but he did not manage the increased risk of collision presented by the aeroplane descending to circuit altitude in the opposite direction (5.1). Additionally, some VFR pilots continue to misconstrue ATC traffic information and instructions in Class C and D airspace as the provision of traffic separation (5.10). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of clear communication and understanding between ATC and pilots regarding traffic management and the level of separation provided.
- name: Non-Standard Traffic Situations
  explanation: The ambiguity in interpreting Civil Aviation Rule 91.223 in non-standard traffic situations is a safety theme. The rule can be interpreted ambiguously, which could contribute to the collision risk at aerodromes (5.3). This theme is relevant because it indicates that the existing rules may not be sufficiently clear to guide pilots' actions in situations where one aircraft is operating in a non-standard circuit, as was the case in this incident.
- name: Overhead Circuit Joining Procedure
  explanation: The correct interpretation and application of the overhead circuit joining procedure is a safety theme. There was potential for misinterpretation of the procedure due to the subtle distinction between the direction of the traffic circuit and the general circuit procedure (4.20-4.24). This theme is relevant because it suggests that pilots may not have a consistent understanding of how to join a circuit safely, particularly when preceding traffic is operating in a non-standard pattern.
- name: Participation in Local Aerodrome User Groups
  explanation: The benefit of participation in local aerodrome user groups is a safety theme. Such groups provide information about their respective activities, which can help manage operational risks (5.8). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of information sharing and collaboration among aerodrome users to enhance situational awareness and safety. In this incident, the helicopter instructor's lack of participation in the user group may have contributed to a lack of awareness of helicopter characteristics among other aerodrome users (4.33).
