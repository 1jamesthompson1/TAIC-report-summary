- Unfortunately, the text provided seems to be incomplete and does not contain the full safety issue. The safety issue starts with "the aviation community, including the regulator, Airways, aerodrome operators and aircraft operators, does not have a consistent approach to reducing the collision risks associated with simultaneous opposed circuits at aerodromes," but it appears to be cut off. To extract the complete safety issue, I would need the full text that contains the entire description of the safety issue. Please provide the complete section of text that includes the entire safety issue for accurate extraction.
- the aviation community, including the regulator, Airways, aerodrome operators and aircraft operators, does not have a consistent approach to reducing the risk of simultaneous opposed circuits at aerodromes. Simultaneous opposed circuits can exist as a result of locally agreed procedures.
