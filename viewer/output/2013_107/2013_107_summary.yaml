- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue management being a contributing factor to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, it is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document states, "There was nothing in the way the driver was handling his train that should have caused the derailment" (4.1.3), indicating that human error and assumptions were not contributing factors. Thus, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no information in the document suggesting that a lack of training and competency contributed to the accident. Therefore, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide evidence that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment was a factor in the accident. Hence, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in the accident as there is no mention of crew interactions or resource management issues contributing to the accident. Therefore, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that the wagon that suffered the wheel-bearing failure "was not put under an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule" despite a high incidence of brake block replacement (4.1.6). This suggests a lack of adherence to safety procedures that could have mitigated the risk, warranting a weighting of 10.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document suggests that there were organizational issues, such as the wagon not being placed on a "watch list" or removed from service until the primary cause of the braking issue was determined and rectified (4.3.10). This indicates a potential deficiency in the organizational safety culture, justifying a weighting of 10.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document mentions that the wagon had a higher than normal brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure, yet it was not subjected to enhanced monitoring (4.1.6). This indicates a lack of effective risk management and analysis, leading to a weighting of 10.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of regulatory oversight and compliance issues contributing to the accident in the document. Therefore, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that situational awareness was a factor in the accident. Thus, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Emergency response preparedness is not discussed as a contributing factor to the accident in the document. Therefore, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 40
  explanation: The document highlights issues with the maintenance and inspection regimes, such as the wagon not being placed on an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule despite a high incidence of brake block replacement (4.1.6), and the failure to detect the impending bearing failure during routine or departure checks (4.3.13). These issues were significant contributors to the accident, warranting a weighting of 40.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The document discusses the RailBAM system, which is an automated bearing acoustic monitor designed to detect and provide an advance warning of potential bearing failures (4.4.5). However, at the time of the accident, the system had not been fully implemented and was not adequately resourced (4.4.14). This lack of effective use of automation contributed significantly to the accident, justifying a weighting of 30.
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions and decision making are not mentioned as factors in the accident within the document. Therefore, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence in the document to suggest that communication breakdown was a contributing factor to the accident. Thus, this theme is assigned a weighting of 0.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the accident outside of those predefined. Therefore, the "Other" category is assigned a weighting of 0.
