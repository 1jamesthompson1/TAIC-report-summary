2013_107,001/16,The Commission recommends that the chief executive of KiwiRail closely monitor the replacement of brake blocks on individual wagons to provide another predictive tool for preventing premature wheel-bearing failures.,,"The high incidence of brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure, was not addressed by putting the wagon under an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule.
",inferred,Confirmed
2013_107,001/16,The Commission recommends that the chief executive of KiwiRail closely monitor the replacement of brake blocks on individual wagons to provide another predictive tool for preventing premature wheel-bearing failures.,,"The visual inspection regime for wheel-bearings is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure, as it failed to detect the impending failure in this case.

2013_107,001/16,The Commission recommends that the chief executive of KiwiRail closely monitor the replacement of brake blocks on individual wagons to provide another predictive tool for preventing premature wheel-bearing failures.,,"The RailBAM system, while operational, did not effectively prevent the derailment due to the procedures in place at the time, which did not prioritize the investigation and remediation of detected faults unless they reached a severity level that was considered critical.

2013_107,001/16,The Commission recommends that the chief executive of KiwiRail closely monitor the replacement of brake blocks on individual wagons to provide another predictive tool for preventing premature wheel-bearing failures.,,"The lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst position and an agreed process for monitoring, reviewing, and acting on RailBAM data contributed to the failure to adequately address detected bearing faults before the derailment occurred.
