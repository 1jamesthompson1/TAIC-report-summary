  \  not only result in damage to rolling stock and rail infrastructure \nequipment\
  \ but can present significant risk to people and the environment.  Freight trains\
  \ \ntravel close to major state highways, past station platforms and across some\
  \ 1600 level \ncrossings on the rail network.   This accident occurred in the early\
  \ hours of the morning, when \ntraffic volume on the normally congested expressway\
  \ was low.  \n4.1.2.  There is an additional risk associated with double trac k\
  \ areas, where a derailment on one line \ncan affect trains travelling on the adjacent\
  \ line, as happened on this occasion.  \n4.1.3.  There was nothing in the way the\
  \ driver was handling his train that should have caused the \nderailment .  Nor\
  \ was t here any track abnorma lity that contributed to the derailment . \n4.1.4.\
  \  The evidence points clearly to a wheel -bearing failure resulting in a \"screwed\
  \ \" axle journal and \nthe consequential dropping  of the bogie side  frame  onto\
  \ the rail .  This sequence is described \nin more detail in the fo llowing analysis.\
  \  \n4.1.5.  The following analysis also discusses  the safety issue with derailments\
  \ in general, and the \nprocesses in place to mitigate the risks of wheel -bearing\
  \  failures , which often result in a \nderailment.   \n4.1.6.  A safety issue arising\
  \ from the derailmen t was t he high incidence of brake block replacement , \nwhich\
  \ can contribute to premature bearing failure. T he wagon that suffered the wheel\
  \ -bearing  \nfailure had a higher than normal brake block replacement, yet it was\
  \ not put under an \nenhanced monitoring and inspection schedule.   \n4.2. The derailment\
  \  \n4.2.1.  Evidence from site observations showed  that the bearing journal had\
  \ separated from the left -\nhand side of the number 3 axle of Wagon PKK321 as the\
  \ train  approached Mercer.   The first \nimpact marks from the derailment were\
  \ evident on the rail .  The train came to a stop 630 \nmetres  further on . \n\
  4.2.2.  The bearing that failed was destroyed completely and most of the components\
  \ were not \nfound.  Therefore, the evidence that may have indicated the probable\
  \ cause of the failure was \neither not available or destroyed.   \n4.2.3.  An ax\
  \ le journal screwing6 off in the man ner described and shown in Figure 3 is a typical\
  \ result \nof a total bearing seizure .  Once the bearing journal is separated from\
  \ the axle, the bogie side \nframe and axle are no longer able to maintain their\
  \ configuration.  The bogie side frame then \ndrop s onto the rail .  This then\
  \ allows the unrestrained wheel to lift and derail.   The markings \non the rail\
  \ at the accident site are consistent with this scenario.  \n4.2.4.  The train continued\
  \ and eventually the derailed wagon turned on its side after the derailed \nwheelset\
  \ struck the north end crossover points at Mercer.  The rear of the train continued\
  \ to \npush into the derailed wagon, forcing the following two wagons to also derail.\
  \  The wagon \nbehind came to rest on the highway 6.4 metres from the track centreline.\
  \  Its two  container s \nseparated from the wagon with the extremity of one container\
  \ some 8.1 metres from the \ncentre of the track .  One wheelset of the second \
  \ wagon back also derailed  but that wagon \nremained upright . \n4.2.5.  This derailment\
  \ is an example of the potential co nsequences of a mainline derailment.  It was\
  \ \nfortuitous that the bearing failure and consequential derailment occurred when\
  \ the train was \nslowing for a 40 kilomet re per hour speed restriction.  If it\
  \ had occurred at a higher speed, the \ndamage to the train, i ts cargo and the\
  \ rail infrastructure would almost certainly have been \nworse.  This would also\
  \ have been the case  if the southbound train on the adjacent track had \n     \
  \                                                   \n6 The term \"screwed journal\"\
  \ is a rail industry term that describes the failure of a wheel -bearing and the\
  \ \nconsequential separation of the wheelset from the axle journal on which the\
  \ bearing was fitted.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -107 been travelling\
  \ at the normal line speed.  The southbound train would be less likely to have \n\
  been able to stop before colliding with the derailed wagon that was obstructing\
  \ its track.   \n4.2.6.  Because the derailment occurred during the early hours\
  \ of the morning, the road traffic on the \nadjacent State Highway One Expressway\
  \ was relative ly light.  Wagons and containers spilling \nonto the road pose  a\
  \ significant risk to road users.  \n4.3. Wheel -bearings  \n4.3.1.  There are a\
  \ number of reasons why a wheel -bearing may fail in service:  \n\uF0B7 inadequate\
  \ lubrication  \n\uF0B7 inadequate overhaul standards  \n\uF0B7 inadequate fitting\
  \ practices  \n\uF0B7 leaving the  bearing in service too long  \n\uF0B7 overheating\
  \  \n\uF0B7 shock loading caused by wheel flats . \n4.3.2.  The inspection of rail\
  \ bearings has traditionally been of a visual nature only.  If the bearing did \n\
  not show any external signs of damage or grease leakage then the internal components\
  \ of the \nbearing were assumed to be in working condition.  It was only when the\
  \ wheel profile reached \nthe condemning limit , or the wagon was due  for its 10\
  \ -year check , that the bearing condition \nwas checked internally.  As a general\
  \ rule however, a complete wheelset change out was \nperformed at the 10 -year check.\
  \  \n4.3.3.  The scheduled inspections of the derailed wagon had been carried out\
  \ at the required \nfrequency.  Additionally, ni ne B -check inspections had been\
  \ carried out on the wagon in 20 13, \nwith the most recent on 19 August 2013, 14\
  \ days before the derailment.  \n4.3.4.  Neither the pre -departure inspection of\
  \ the stationary train nor the roll -by inspection of the \ntrain as it departed\
  \ fro m Tauranga noted any visual or audible signs of the impending bearing \nfailure.\
  \    \n4.3.5.  The bearing that failed was fitted to a new axle at KiwiRail's Hutt\
  \ Workshop on 17 December \n2005.  The bearing check -sheet showed that the package\
  \ bearing  installation compli ed with \nKiwiRail's Wheelset Manual M6000 in that:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the press force to fit the bearing  of 45 tonnes  was at the maximum\
  \ allowable range of \n40 to 45 tonnes  \n\uF0B7 the bearing cap bolt torque7 was\
  \ to the required 220 newton metres  \n\uF0B7 the bearing lateral end play of seve\
  \ n thousandth s of an inch was within the allowable \nrange of between one and\
  \ fifteen thousandth s. \n4.3.6.  Records show that the bearing had been in  use\
  \ since  mid-2006 (about seven  years)  and the \nwagon had travelled  330,000 kilometres\
  \ before the bearing failed . \n4.3.7.  Packaged bearings are fitted as a sealed\
  \ unit and do not require re -greasing while in service. \nThe normal running temperature\
  \ for wheel -bearing was between 30 and 50 degrees \ncentigrade.  Generally, when\
  \ a wheel -bearing assembly becomes too hot to be touche d it is \nconsidered to\
  \ be running over temperature and the wagon should be withdrawn from service \n\
  for further inspection.  A \"hot box \"8 will develop when the wheel -bearing is\
  \ permitted to \noperate at excessive temperatures.  If a hot box is not identified\
  \ an d the wagon continues \n                                                  \
  \      \n7 Torque is a measure of the turning force applied to an object such as\
  \ a bolt.  The magnitude of torque \ndepends on the force applied, the length of\
  \ the lever arm and the angle between the force and the lever arm.  \n8 A hot box\
  \ is the overheating of the bearing/axle journal assembly.  \nFinal report RO -2013\
  \ -107 \n<< Page 11 >>\n running, the bearing may seize and develop a \"screwed\
  \ journal \" and then the wagon will \neventually derail if permitted to continue\
  \ running.  \n4.3.8.  The enclosed arrangement of a packaged bearing ma kes it impossible\
  \ to visually inspect its \ninternal moving parts without disassembly, which only\
  \ occurred nominally every 10 ye ars \nwhen a wheelset overhaul was required because\
  \ the wheel profile was at condemning limits.   \nA study of overheated roller bearing\
  \ data for 2008 to 2010 conducted by the Asso ciation of \nAmerican Railroads concluded\
  \ that the following defects accounted for more than 90% of \nconfirmed overheated\
  \ roller bearing failures:  \n\uF0B7 fatigue spalling  31.9%  \n\uF0B7 water etching9\
  \ 25.8%  \n\uF0B7 mechanical damage 14.6%  \n\uF0B7 loose bearing  10.9%  \n\uF0B7\
  \ [bearing] adapter defect  4.6%  \n\uF0B7 wheel defect 3.7% . \n4.3.9.  The derailed\
  \ wagon had between two and eight brake blocks replaced on nine separate \noccasions,\
  \ as well as other repairs to the braking system twice in the eight  months leading\
  \ up \nto the derailment.  Only the total number of brake b locks changed on the\
  \ wagon was recorded \nwhen replacement was carried out.  It was therefore not possible\
  \ to determine whether or not \nthe A3 brake block (failed bearing) was replaced\
  \ more often than on any of the other seven \nwheels on the wagon.  \n4.3.10.  Given\
  \ the frequency of the unscheduled work required on the wagon 's brake system during\
  \ \n2013, it is surprising that the wagon was not placed on a \"watch list \" or\
  \ removed from service \nuntil the primary cause of the braking issue was determined\
  \ and rectified.  KiwiRail has \naddressed this issue with the reintroduction of\
  \ a \"rogue wagon \" list (see section 6). \n4.3.11.  A 2015 report by Indian Railways\
  \ Rolling Stock Maintenan ce Inc. into brake binding10 stated \nthat failure s in\
  \ the braking system and the operation of the braking system are the major \ncauses\
  \ of brake binding that then damages the wheels and the bearings.   \n4.3.12.  As\
  \ previously mentioned , not enough of the destroyed beari ng could be recovered\
  \ to make a \nmeaningful analysis of what ultimately caused it to fail.  However,\
  \ t he high number of brake \nblock replacements on the derailed wagon compared\
  \ with other similar wagons on the train \nraises the question of whether the conditi\
  \ on of the braking system and brake block \nreplacement frequency could have been\
  \ a factor contribut ing to the premature bearing failure.  \nBrake binding  can\
  \ cause high wheel temperatures, which can transmit to the wheel -bearing , \nand\
  \ can also cause wheel flats , which are also known to contribute to premature wheel\
  \ -\nbearing failure .  The Indian Rail ways  study concluded that there was evidence\
  \  that brake \nbinding  can contribute to premature wheel -bearing failure.  Therefore,\
  \ the Commission is \nrecommending that Kiwi Rail consider recording brake block\
  \ faults by wheel to provide another \npredictive tool for preventing premature\
  \ wheel -bearing failure.  \n4.3.13.  The t ime from when the first visual signs\
  \ of bearing failure become evident to total bearing \nfailure can be short.  The\
  \ regime of visual inspection is not therefore an effective means of \nmanaging\
  \ and preventing total wheel -bearing failure.  This accident  is evidence in support\
  \ of  \nthat hypothesis .  None of the routine or departure checks made on the wagon\
  \ detected the \nimpending failure.  \n  \n                                    \
  \                    \n9  Water etching is the rusting with pitting and corrosion\
  \ from exposure to moisture.   \n10 Brake binding occurs whenever a brake block\
  \ grips the wheel with excessive braking force, and/or  does \nnot release properly.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -107 4.4. Bearing acoustic monitors\
  \   \n4.4.1.  The issue of a trackside detection system to reduce the risk of bearing\
  \ failures was referre d to \nin Commission report 04 -130, Express freight train\
  \ derailments due to axle bearing failures, \nvarious locations .  The report referred\
  \ to four express freight train derailments attributed to \naxle bearing failures\
  \ between 5 November 2004 and 21 March 200 5.  Toll Rail (KiwiRail's \npredecessor\
  \ ) evaluated  at that time that the cost of installing a trackside detection system\
  \ \noutweighed the cost/risk of wheelset bearing r elated  failures.   \n4.4.2.\
  \  In 2007  the Commission investigated another mainline derailment , where a  failed\
  \ wheel -\nbearing caused the  derailment of a freight train near  Huntly11.  There\
  \  were 11 subsequent \nwheel  bearing failures at various locations over the following\
  \ 12 months .  The Commission  \nissued an urgent recommendation to the chief executive\
  \ of the Land Transport Safety \nAuthority (now NZ Transport Agency ) on 4 March\
  \ 2008, stating in part:   \nThe Commission considers it a safety issue that the\
  \ New Zealand rail network is \nnot equipped with an integrated acoustic bearing\
  \ monitoring system compatible \nwith current international practice.  The Commission\
  \ recommends the Chief \nExecutive of Land Transport NZ urgently addresses this\
  \ safety issue. (008/08)  \n4.4.3.  Work then began on planning for a network of\
  \ bearing acoustic monitors.  On 12 November \n2010  KiwiRail confirm ed the first\
  \  RailBAM system with an in-motion weighbridge had been \ninstalled at Rolleston,\
  \ near Christchurch .  Two other RailBAM systems were  about to be \ninstalled at\
  \ Te Puna , near Tauranga , and Bunnythorpe, near Palmerston North  (see Figure\
  \ 7).  \nKiwiRail determined that these strategic locations had the potential to\
  \ record the condition of \nmore than 90% of the wagon fleet on a regular basis.\
  \  The system relies on every wagon in \nKiwiRail's fleet being fitted with a unique\
  \ identification tag.  KiwiRail advis ed that about 65% \nof the wagon fleet had\
  \ been fitted with identification tags at that time . \n4.4.4.  KiwiRail reported\
  \ that the three RailBAM systems became fully operational from early 2012.   \n\
  \ \n                                                        \n11 Report 07 -114,\
  \ Derailment caused by a wheel -bearing failure, Huntly, 19 October 2007, and 11\
  \ \nsubsequent wheel -bearing failures at various locations during the following\
  \ 12-month  period.  \nFinal report RO -2013 -107 \n<< Page 13 >>\n  \nFigure 7\
  \ \nThe location of RailBAM sites  \n \n4.4.5.  The RailBAM system is a condition\
  \ monitor, rather than a failure detector.  The system \nprovides data for both\
  \ fault trending and an immediate alert to remove a wagon from service.  \nThe system\
  \ is designed to detect and rank axle bearing faults, and provide con dition \n\
  monitoring reports and an advance warning of potential bearing failure s, unlike\
  \ a \"hot box \" \ndetector , which  typically gives up to 60 minutes ' warning\
  \ between a fault being detectable and \na complete bearing failure.   \n4.4.6.\
  \  Sampled real -time data is analys ed by a computerised data acquisition and analysis\
  \ unit \nduring and immediately after the train has passed the RailBAM system. \
  \ The RailBAM system \nextracts bearing fault and wheel flat \"signatures \" from\
  \ extraneous noise, enabling fault \nidentification and se verity classification\
  \  (refer to Table 1 below) .  The data for individual \nbearings is stored in the\
  \ RailBAM trending database.  The outputs are compared with the \n\n\n<< Page 14\
  \ >>\n Final report RO -2013 -107 bearing standard and an exception report is generated.\
  \  However, the acoustic measurement \ncan be affected by environmental noise that\
  \ may result in either missed faults or false alarms.   \n4.4.7.  When a \"Bearing\
  \ severity level\" of 4 is reached, an auto -email is sent  (see Table 1 below for\
  \ \nintervention action  at the tim e of this derailment) .  \"Bearing severity\
  \ \" has a step scale where \nRS1 (bearing running surface fault) represents the\
  \ highest fault types t hroug h to RS3 for the \nlowest  fault , and also a no fault\
  \ found (NFF).  Other categories are LF ( looseness/fretting ) and  \nWHLFLT (wheel\
  \  flat).  The step scale also has prefix descriptors to reduce the confidence of\
  \ \nthe fault level e.g. N OISY - unknown extraneous noise, FBS - flanging, braking\
  \ or slamming , \nor SHRK - tonal noise (r emoved before bearing analysis).  \n\
  Table 1: Intervention action at the time of th e derailment  \nBearing severity\
  \ level  Intervention action  \n4 Auto -email sent and the wagon removed from \n\
  service  \n3 Analyst uses a longer data period to determine \nwhether the condition\
  \ is a bearing fault or \nrandom noise.  If a fault, the wagon is \nexamined at\
  \ the maintenance depot and \ncorrective action taken    \n2 Noted by the analyst\
  \  \n1 Noted by the analyst  \n4.4.8.  The C-class bearings fitted to wheelsets\
  \ on KiwiRail's wagon fleet had a tendency to generate \nan \"extraneous noise\"\
  \  fault .  Because the system had been operating for nearly two years and \ngenerated\
  \ a large number of noisy bearing  faults,  none of which had resu lted in a bearing\
  \ \nfailure, the condition was treated as acceptable and no further action was taken.\
  \   \n4.4.9.  The reported unknown extraneous noise on the rolling surface was mostly\
  \ at level 1 only.  Had \nthe bearing severity been reported as a level \"4\" and\
  \ sent a n auto -alert, it was likely that the \nwagon would have been withdrawn\
  \ from service and investigated for the source of noise. \nDuring the early phases\
  \ of commissioning the RailBAM , a sample of wagons with noisy RS1 \nfaults were\
  \ withdrawn for service and closer  examination.  No faults relating to  the bearing\
  \ \nnoise were detected.    \n4.4.10.  KiwiRail's investigation identified loose\
  \ bearing keeps as contributing to the extraneous \nenvironmental noise.  On 25\
  \ February 2014 document TG -BO-113 Axle Keep Bolt Assembly \nwas revi sed and issued\
  \ to all field maintenance staff to ensure proper assembly and tightened \nto a\
  \ minimum torque standard.   \n4.4.11.  Over a period of 23 days before the derailment,\
  \ the Te Puna RailBAM had generated 20 fault \nrecords12 for the failed wheelset\
  \ A3  (which  held the bearing that eventually failed ); 15 were \nreported as bearing\
  \ severity level 2, with the other five reported as bearing severity level 1 . \
  \ \nKiwiRail took no action to remove the wagon from service for closer examination\
  \ at the time .  \nKiwiRail's rat ionale was that the recordings generated a maximum\
  \ bearing severity of a level 2 \nfault , and  the sampling examinations carried\
  \ out during the commissioning of the system had \nshown no history of faults of\
  \ this magnitude that had resulted in a catastrophic be aring failure.  \nThe high\
  \ total number of bearing severity level 2 faults generated on a daily basis was\
  \ such \nthat only wagons having level 3 and above bearing severity level were determined\
  \ to require \nfurther examination.  \n4.4.12.  At the time of the derailment ,\
  \ the position of a dedicated RailBAM analyst  had not been \ncreated , nor was\
  \ there an agreed RailBAM process that set out  the responsibilities associated\
  \ \nwith the monitoring and reviewing of the RailBAM data and the actions to be\
  \ taken.   Instead , \nthe data genera ted was perused by the man ager in charge\
  \ of the project, who did not have the \ntime to properly  analyse the data produced\
  \ by the RailBAM system.  KiwiRail has since \n                                \
  \                        \n12 NOISY (RS1), FBS (RS1) and RS1.  \nFinal report RO\
  \ -2013 -107 \n<< Page 15 >>\n addressed this issue so no recommendation has been\
  \ made  in this report  (see section 6, \nsafety actions).   \n4.4.13.  Before this\
  \ derailment KiwiRail's practice was to keep a wagon in service unless the evaluator\
  \ \nwas sure that it had a faulty bearing.  From 28 November 2013  KiwiRail's instruction\
  \ required  \nthe RailBAM analyst to review the RailBAM data fr om the previous\
  \ day or weekend every week \nday.  The RailBAM analyst is required to sort, on\
  \ a daily basis, data by the worst case bearings.  \nAll level 3 alert faults are\
  \ analysed using a longer data period.  When the analyst is able to \nidentify clear\
  \ fault s, the wagon is added to the watch list and monitored on a weekly basis.\
  \  \nThe wagon is immediately coded as a \"Bad Order \", and an email forwarded\
  \ to the \nmaintenance depot  with a description of the findings and any remedial\
  \ action required.  When \nthe analys t finds random noise on a wagon, an instruction\
  \ is sent to the asset maintainers to \ninspect, investigate and undertake corrective\
  \ action  (see section 6, safety actions).   Level 2 \nalerts are analysed in a\
  \ similar manner.  \n4.4.14.  The fault developing in the wheel -bearing had been\
  \ detected by the bearing acoustic monitor.  \nUnder the procedures adopted since\
  \ this derailment there is a greater likelihood that the \nwagon would have been\
  \ taken out of service for inspection and remedial work  before the \nfailure occurred\
  \ , thus preventing this derailment .   \n4.4.15.  Also supporting the effectiveness\
  \ of the bearing acoustic monitoring system is the number of \nmainline derailments\
  \ recorded on the national rail network  which  has trended downward from \n55 to\
  \ seven over a 10-year period, a reduction of 87%.  While not all wagons pass over\
  \ a \nRailBAM unit on a regular basis, more than 90% of the fleet does.  More importantly\
  \ , the \"high \nuse\" wagons on unit trains such as the MetroPort fleet that shuttle\
  \ between  Tauranga and \nAuckland pass over the RailBAM daily in both directions\
  \ , providing valuable information on \nbearing condition that enables scheduling\
  \ of preventative maintenance . \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
