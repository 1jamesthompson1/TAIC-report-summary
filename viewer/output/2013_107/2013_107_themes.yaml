- name: Wheel-bearing Failures
  explanation: Wheel-bearing failures are a critical safety theme as they can lead to derailments. In this accident, the "evidence points clearly to a wheel-bearing failure resulting in a 'screwed' axle journal and the consequential dropping of the bogie side frame onto the rail" (4.1.4). The failure of the wheel-bearing was the direct cause of the derailment (5.1), and the report discusses the processes in place to mitigate the risks of such failures (4.1.5). The wheel-bearing that failed had been in use for approximately seven years and had traveled 330,000 kilometers before failing (4.3.6), indicating that the longevity and usage of wheel-bearings are factors that need to be monitored to ensure safety.
- name: Inadequate Monitoring Systems
  explanation: The accident highlighted the inadequacy of the RailBAM system in place at the time to detect and prevent wheel-bearing failures. The RailBAM system "had the potential to have detected the pending failure of the wheel-bearing and trigger the removal of the wagon from service before the bearing failed" (5.4), but it was not fully implemented or adequately resourced to achieve this outcome. Prior to the derailment, the Te Puna RailBAM had generated 20 fault records for the failed wheelset, but no action was taken to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). This indicates that the monitoring systems in place were not effective in preventing the accident, making it a significant safety theme.
- name: Brake System Issues
  explanation: Problems with the braking system are a safety theme as they can lead to wheel and wheel-bearing damage, which in turn can cause derailments. The report suggests that "problems with the wagon's braking systems leading to an unusually high number of fused brake block events led to wheel and wheel-bearing damage" (5.2). The derailed wagon had a high incidence of brake block replacement, which can contribute to premature bearing failure (4.1.6), and the frequency of unscheduled work on the wagon's brake system in 2013 was surprising, given that it was not placed on a "watch list" or removed from service (4.3.10). This indicates that issues with the brake system were a contributing factor to the accident and represent a broader safety concern.
- name: Inspection and Maintenance Practices
  explanation: Inspection and maintenance practices are a safety theme because inadequate practices can fail to detect impending failures. The scheduled inspections of the derailed wagon had been carried out at the required frequency, but neither the pre-departure inspection nor the roll-by inspection detected any signs of the impending bearing failure (4.3.3, 4.3.4). The report also notes that the visual inspection regime is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure (4.3.13). This suggests that the inspection and maintenance practices in place at the time of the accident were insufficient to detect and prevent the wheel-bearing failure that led to the derailment.
- name: Risk Management and Response
  explanation: Risk management and response is a safety theme because the lack of appropriate action in response to identified risks can lead to accidents. Despite the RailBAM system generating multiple fault records for the failed wheelset, KiwiRail did not take action to remove the wagon from service (4.4.11). Additionally, there was no dedicated RailBAM analyst position or agreed process for monitoring and reviewing RailBAM data at the time of the derailment (4.4.12). This indicates that the risk management and response to the identified bearing faults were inadequate, which is a significant safety theme related to this accident.
- name: Organizational Oversight
  explanation: Organizational oversight is a safety theme as it encompasses the broader systemic issues that can lead to accidents. The report indicates that KiwiRail had not addressed the issue of high brake block replacement frequency with an enhanced monitoring and inspection schedule (4.1.6), and there was no "watch list" or removal from service despite the frequency of unscheduled brake system work (4.3.10). Furthermore, the lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst and an agreed RailBAM process (4.4.12) points to organizational shortcomings in addressing safety risks. This theme is relevant as it reflects on the organizational practices and decision-making processes that failed to prevent the accident.
