- safety_issue: 'The visual inspection regime for wheel-bearings is not an effective means of managing and preventing total wheel-bearing failure, as it failed to detect the impending failure in this case.

- safety_issue: 'The RailBAM system, while operational, did not effectively prevent the derailment due to the procedures in place at the time, which did not prioritize the investigation and remediation of detected faults unless they reached a severity level that was considered critical.

    '

- safety_issue: 'The lack of a dedicated RailBAM analyst position and an agreed process for monitoring, reviewing, and acting on RailBAM data contributed to the failure to adequately address detected bearing faults before the derailment occurred.
