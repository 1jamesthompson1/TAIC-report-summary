- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document mentions that the operator's refueling procedures left several opportunities for fuel contamination, which suggests a lack of adherence to robust safety procedures could have contributed to the accident ("the operator's refuelling procedures for remote sites left several opportunities for fuel contamination to occur" (4.3.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document indicates that the operator did not have documented procedures, guidance material, and recorded training for the handling of aviation fuels, which suggests that the organizational safety culture may not have been robust enough to prevent the accident ("The operator did not have any such documentation" (4.3.16)).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document suggests that there were opportunities to improve the operator's fuel handling practices, which is indicative of inadequate risk management and analysis ("Three fuel contamination occurrences in a 15-month period suggest that opportunities existed to improve the operator's fuel handling practices" (4.3.16)).

- name: Other
  percentage: 65
  explanation: The primary contributing factor to the accident was contaminated fuel, which caused a momentary reduction in engine power leading to low rotor RPM and the subsequent accident ("The condition of low rotor revolutions per minute very likely resulted from a momentary reduction in available engine power caused by contaminated fuel" (5.3)). This specific cause does not fall under any of the predefined safety themes, hence the creation of the "Other" category.
