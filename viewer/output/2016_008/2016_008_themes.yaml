- name: Fuel Contamination
  explanation: 'Fuel contamination is a critical safety theme as it directly impacts engine performance and reliability. In this accident, contaminated fuel was identified as the primary cause of the momentary reduction in engine power, which led to the low rotor RPM condition and ultimately the accident. The analysis found that "contaminants were found in: the fuel filter housing, the fuel hose assembly running to the fuel nozzle, and the fuel nozzle itself" (4.2.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Furthermore, the fuel sample recovered was "a muddy brown colour" indicating contamination that could have "temporarily restricted the fuel flow through the spray tip assembly within the fuel nozzle" (4.2.18). This theme is relevant because the helicopter''s engine performance was compromised due to contaminated fuel, which was a direct contributor to the accident.'
- name: Fuel Handling Procedures
  explanation: Fuel handling procedures are a significant safety theme as improper handling can introduce contaminants into the fuel system, leading to engine performance issues. In this case, the operator's refueling procedures "left several opportunities for fuel contamination" (4.3.6). The frequent refueling cycles in a dusty environment increased the risk of fuel becoming contaminated (4.3.13). Moreover, there were "three fuel contamination occurrences in a 15-month period" which suggests that there were opportunities to improve the operator's fuel handling practices (4.3.16). This theme is relevant because lapses in fuel handling procedures contributed to the fuel contamination that caused the accident.
- name: Engine Power Management
  explanation: Engine power management is a crucial safety theme as it involves the ability of the aircraft's systems to maintain and control engine power output under varying conditions. During the accident, the engine's power turbine governor and fuel control unit failed to correct a decrease in output shaft RPM due to contaminated fuel, as "the expected corresponding increase in the gas temperature did not immediately occur" (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because the inability to manage and maintain engine power was a contributing factor to the low rotor RPM and the subsequent accident.
- name: Pilot Response to Emergency Situations
  explanation: Pilot response to emergency situations is a key safety theme, as the pilot's actions during an unexpected event can significantly influence the outcome. In this incident, the pilot was forced to attempt a run-on landing when faced with a low rotor RPM situation (4.1.1). The pilot's decision-making and actions during the emergency were critical to the outcome. This theme is relevant because the pilot's response to the low rotor RPM warning was a direct result of the momentary loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.
- name: Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection
  explanation: Aircraft maintenance and inspection are vital safety themes, as they ensure the aircraft's systems and components are functioning correctly and are free from defects that could lead to an accident. The investigation found no mechanical defects in the engine, power turbine governor, or fuel control unit that could have prevented normal operation (4.2.7). However, the sprag clutch was examined to determine if pre-existing damage contributed to the decrease in rotor RPM (4.4.1). This theme is relevant because the integrity of the aircraft's components, ensured through proper maintenance and inspection, is essential for safe operation.
- name: Operator's Safety Culture and Practices
  explanation: The operator's safety culture and practices are a safety theme that encompasses the attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that employees share in relation to safety. In this case, the lack of documented procedures, guidance material, and recorded training for handling aviation fuels indicates a gap in the operator's safety practices (4.3.16). The operator's approach to managing fuel contamination risks and the absence of a proactive safety culture contributed to the accident. This theme is relevant because an operator's commitment to safety can significantly reduce the risk of accidents.
