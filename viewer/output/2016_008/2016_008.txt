The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor  the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the  
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The princ ipal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue ) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 14 November 2016, a Robinson Helicopter Company R66 helicopter was conducting an 
agricultural spraying operation around the Hokonui  Hills in Southland , with one  pilot on board .  
On the last spray run for the day the pilot received an indication of  low rotor revolutions -per-
minute , which was a critical condition that requi red immediate action.  However, at that time 
the helicopter was too low to recover from the situation, so the pilot  turned the helicopter and 
attempted a 'run -on landing'  - a manoeuvre used to transition from forward flight to a landing 
on the surface when  there is insufficient power available to sustain a hover . 
1.2. The helicopter landed heavily and pitched forward, causing the main rotor blades to contact 
the ground.  The helicopter was substantially damaged, but the pilot escaped with minor 
injuries only.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the condition of  
low rotor revolutions -per-minute  very likely resulted from a momentary reduction in available 
engine power cause d by contaminated fuel.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the operator's refuelling procedures for remote sites left 
several opportunities for fuel contamination to occur . 
1.5. The Commission identified the safety issue  that more educational material is needed to alert 
operators to the risk of contaminated fuel when o perating and refuelling in remote , dusty 
environments.  
1.6. The Commission made two recommendations , one to the Director of Civil Aviation to provide 
the industry with more educational material and guidance on mitigating the risk of 
contaminated fuel when opera ting at remote sites, and one to the President of Aviation New 
Zealand to promulgate the lessons learned from this accident to its members with a view to 
increasing awareness of the risk of fuel contamination during remote refuelling procedures.  
1.7. The key le ssons  arising from this  inquiry are : 
 refuelling aircraft at remote locations increases the risk of fuel contamination.  Operators 
should take all precautions to prevent any debris entering the fuel supply chain , from the 
initial fuel supplier to the aircra ft fuel tank  
 aircraft fuel-filtering systems are an important defence against contaminated fuel causing 
an accident.  Where available , operators should consider fitting additional airframe filters 
to aircraft being operated and refuelled at remote location s.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At 1600 on 14 November 2016, t he Civil Aviation Authority notified the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission  (Commission) of the accident involving a  Robinson Helicopter 
Company (Robinson  Helicopters ) R66 helicopter.  The Commis sion opened an inquiry under 
section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an 
investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 15 November 2016 two Commission investigators travelled  to Invercargill and conducted 
the initial scen e examination  and interviews with three  witness es. 
2.3. On 16 November 2016 the helicopter wreckage was moved to a secure location at Invercargill 
Airport .  
2.4. On 17 November 2016 the Commission investigators conducted a preliminary engine 
inspection  with the assistance of an independent  licen sed aircraft engineer.  The helicopter  
global positioning system  (GPS) navigation equipment was removed for data extraction and 
analysis.  
2.5. On 28 November 2016  the Commission investigators returned to Invercargill accompanied by 
a Rolls -Royce representative to conduct a detailed  engine investigation  and to download 
recorded data from the engine monitoring unit (EMU).   
2.6. The helicopter wreckage was then relocated to the Commission's storage facility in Wellington.  
2.7. Fuel samples were forwarded to the Defence Technology Agency2 for analysis .  The f uel control 
unit and power t urbin e governor  were removed from the engine and  sent to the manufacture r, 
Honeywell Aerospace  in the United States , for further  testing .  Testing  was conducted under 
the supervision  of a United States Accredited Representative from the National Transportation 
Safety Board . 
2.8. The Commission appointed an independent overhaul facility to inspect and test the sprag 
clutch3.  The Commission also appointed  an independent overhaul facility to inspect and test 
the fuel nozzle . 
2.9. On 6 September 2018 the draft report was sent to interested persons for comment. Written 
submissions were received from five interested persons. The Commission considered the 
submissions and any changes as a result of those submissions have been included in the final 
report.  
2.10.  On 24 October 2018 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On the morning of Monday 14 November 2016,  a Robinson Helicopters R66 helicopter  
regist ered  ZK-HAG (the helicopter) , the pilot, a ground support vehicle and a ground crew  
member  were  tasked with four ag ricultural spraying jobs.  
3.1.2.  The pilot's day commenced at the operator's base near Otautau , Southland  by sterilis ing the 
helicopter spray system4 and prepar ing ground loading equipment . The pilot  flew the 
helicopter to the first job of the day and commenced spraying by approximatel y 0730 . 
3.1.3.  The pilot kept the helicopter engine running  continuously throughout  the working day, 
including during  all refuel s and rest breaks .   
3.1.4.  At approximately 1530  the helicopter was loaded  for the last run of the day  with 150 litres of 
water . This 'flushing ' run was to rinse residual  chemical s from the helicopter spray system.   
3.1.5.  The helicopter returned  to the target ed spray  area for what was expected to be a two-minute 
flight. From a straight and level flight at approximately 80 knots5, the pilot initiated a 
descending right -hand turn to line up  with the spray run  (Figure 1). While in descent, the low 
rotor RPM (revolutions per minute) warning light and horn activat ed. The pilot responded by 
lower ing the collective  lever6, and the rotor RPM recovered  to within the operating range . The 
pilot then  decided to continue the  descent and lined  up for the spray run.  
3.1.6.  As the helicopter  levell ed out, the low rotor RPM warnings activated again. At that point t he 
helicopter had  insuffi cient height or air speed to recover the  rotor  RPM, so the pilot  turned 
towards  a more suitable area and attempt ed a run -on landing7. 
3.1.7.  At 1538  the helicopter struck  the ground heavily at a shallow angle , before  bounc ing and 
pitch ing forward , causing the main rotor to contact the ground. The helicopter rolled on  to its 
left side then rotated through 360º while the rotor blades continued to strike  the ground.  
3.1.8.  The engine continued to operate with sufficient power to damage  the helicopter  further  as the 
rotating blades dug into the ground . The tail section was separated at the tail boom and the 
main rotor blades broke  off at approximately 600 m illimetres  (mm)  from the centre of the  
main  rotor head  (Figure 2).  At this point the engine RPM in creased due to the lack of load .  
3.1.9.  The pilot shut down the engine by closing the fuel cut-off valve , then turned off the master 
electrics and  emergency locat or transmitter  (ELT).  The pilot  climb ed out of the helicopter and 
turned off the externally mounted spray pump , then  phoned the Rescue Coordination Centre 
New Zealand to advise it of the accident and to cancel the ELT alert.  
3.1.10.  The pilot received minor bruising .  There was no post -accident fire.

 3.2. Location and weather  
3.2.1.  The accident site was a recently ploughed paddock 47 kilometres  northeast  of Invercargill in 
the Hokonui Hills. The surrounding terrain consisted of rolling hill country with a mixture of 
farm land , scrubby gorse  and some forest.  
3.2.2.  The weather conditions in the vicinity  at the time w ere clear, with the wind estimated by the 
pilot to have been seven to 10 knots  from the southeast.  
3.2.3.  A weather station  located approximately 13  kilometres  southwest of the accident site  
recorded the following data at the approximate time of the accident :  
 air temperature:  15º Celsius  
 humidity :  70%  
 precipitation :   Nil 
 wind:   Seven  knots, gusting nine knots from the southeast . 
3.3. The operation  
3.3.1.  A normal spraying operation involved numerous short flights lasting  between  two and 10 
minutes, depending on the application rate and nature of the block being sprayed.  
3.3.2.  The ground crew member would position the support vehicle on an open , flat site as close as 
practicable to the targeted spray area and with access to a water supply .  The ground crew  
member  would prepare a product load  while the helicopter was awa y, then when it returned 
add t he product  and water to the helicopter spray tank  to make up the next load.  
3.3.3.  This pilot normally refuell ed the helicopter  and left the engine running while the ground crew  
member  loaded the spray tank.  A standard fuel load pro vided for 20 minutes of flying. Where 
possible, refuelling was conducted from the supply tank on the back of the support vehicle 
using an electric pump. Otherwise the pilot would transfer  fuel from the support vehicle  to the 
helicopter in 20-litre plastic fuel containers .   Both methods of refuelling were  used that day.  
3.4. Organisational information  
3.4.1.  The operator held a Civil Aviation Rule s Part 137 operating certificate for commercial 
agricultural operations. At the time of the accident the operator had fou r helicopters, including  
the accident aircraft . 
3.4.2.  The operator had a drug and alcohol policy that required all pilots to be tested as a pre-
employment condition , with random  testing conducted  annually .  The test results for this pilot 
had been  negative.   The Commission  considers that it is good practice to conduct post-
accident  and incident drug and alcohol testing .  However , the operator 's policy did not require 
this and no post -accident testing was carried out in this instance.  
3.5. Personnel information  
3.5.1.  The pilot had obtained a commercial pilot licence (helicopter) in October 2004  and 
commenced work with the operator in 2010 . All licen sing requirements were current at the 
time of the accident.  
3.5.2.  At the time of the accident the pilot  had accrued a total of 4 ,400 helicopter flight hours, 
almost entirely on Robinson helicopters , with 660 hours on the R66  and 3,020 hours flying on 
agricultural operations. The pilot was the operator's  chief pilot and provided a supervisory role 
for Grade 2 agricultural p ilots within the company.  
3.5.3.  The pilot held a current Class 1 aviation medical certificate that was valid until 6 April 2017.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 3.6. Aircraft information  
3.6.1.  The Robinson R66 is a light helicopter with seating for a pilot and four passengers. It is 
powered by a single Rolls -Royce RR300 turbine engine.  
3.6.2.  The helicopter had been  imported into New Zealand in February 2011 and purchased by the 
operator in September 2014.  The helicopter airframe and engine both had a total recorded 
flight time of 1 ,683.9 hours.  
3.6.3.  The helicopter was e quipped with an agricultural spray system that had been installed in 
accordance with the equipment  manufacturer 's supplemental type certificate .  The spray 
system had been approved for agricultural operations under Civil Aviation Rules  Part 137.   The 
syste m comprised: an underbelly -mounted, fibreglass spray tank ; two non -metallic spray 
booms ; and a petrol -powered spray pump  mounted on one of the skids .  A GPS-guided 
TracMap8 system had been installed to track  and record the areas sprayed .  
3.6.4.  The helicopter had been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's  instructions.  The 
most recent  technical log had been  issued  on 13 August 2016 .  The next scheduled 
maintenance was due in 1.3 hours at an airframe total time of 1 ,685.2  hours.  The helicopter 
had b een booked to have th at maintenance at the completion of the accident job. The next  
annual review of airworthiness  was due on 29 July 2017.  
3.6.5.  At the time of the accident there were no record ed defects and the p ilot reported  that the 
helicopter had been perform ing normally . 
3.7. Emergency locator transmitter  
3.7.1.  The ELT installed on the helicopter was a  Kannad 406 AF-Compact . This automatically 
activated during the accident sequence and remained  connected to its externally mounted 
aerial.  An alert message generate d at 15 38 was received by the Rescue Coordination Centre 
in Wellington at 1543. The message had been detected by the medium -altitude earth orbit 
search and rescue satellite network . This satellite network was operational but still under 
development and had  not yet reached its full operational capability.  
3.7.2.  The pilot turned  off the ELT soon after the accident .  At 1543 the pilot called the Rescue 
Coordination Centre to advise it of the accident, that there were no injuries and that the re was 
no need for a rescue operation.   This action prevented any unnecessary deployment of search

3.8.1.  On the accident flight the helicopter spray tank was loaded with 150 litres of water for a 
flushing run .  The fuel tank was reported by the pilot to be between one-eighth  and one-
quarter  full.  This gave a total weight of no more than 1 ,032 kilograms ( kg), 193 kg  below the 
maximum allowable all -up weight of 1 ,225 kg.  
3.8.2.  The longitudinal centre of gravity position with a quarter of a  tank of f uel was calculated to be 
2,433mm aft of the datum9 at a total weight of 1 ,032 kg , and the zero -fuel longitudinal 
position was calculated to be 2,423mm  at a total weight  of 978 kg. Both of these positions 
were  within the allowable longitudinal centre of gravity range of 2,311 to 2, 603mm  for that 
weight  range . 
3.8.3.  The operator made use of quick -reference charts specifying the spray loads that could be 
carried for specific aircraft, pilot s and fuel loading s. With a s tandard fuel load of 20 minutes, 
the maximum spray load that the pilot was able to carry with the helicopter was 374  kg.

 3.9. Engine  
3.9.1.  The RR300 engine  had achieved Federal Aviation Administration  type certification in February 
2008 .  The engine  was rated at 300 shaft horsepower , but w hen installed in the R66 
helicopter it was de-rated to 224 shaft horsepower  maximum continuous power and 270 shaft 
horsepower  for a five-minute  peak . See Appendi ces 1 and 2 for more details on the engine 
and its arrangement withi n the helicopter.  
3.9.2.  The installed engine had been  fitted when the helicopter was manufactured . 
Fuel system  
3.9.3.  The R66 fuel system was gravity fed from the fuel tank to the engine following the path shown 
in Figure 3 .

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 3.9.4.  The fuel tank was a single, crash -resistant bladder secured inside an aluminium structure. The 
supply take -off point for the engine was above the lowest level of the tank and through a 
strainer. Any sediment or water would  collect below the outlet and could  be drained manually 
from the tank through a fuel drain tube . The drain tube was accessible via a left -side cowl door 
(see Appendix 6: R66 fuel system  layout ). 
3.9.5.  A fuel shut-off valve was fitted between the tank and the engine. The pilot operate d the valve 
with a push -pull knob  located near the base of the pilot's collective lever . A separate fuel cut -
off push -pull knob mounted near the centre of the upright control conso le turned off the fuel 
flow at the fuel control unit.  
3.9.6.  The fuel level was displayed on a fuel gauge in quarter -tank increments. A separate LOW FUEL 
sensor and caution light was calibrated to illuminate with 19 litres remaining in the tank. This 
equate d to approximately 10 minutes ' flying time . 
3.9.7.  The engine pump drew  fuel from the tank, filter ed it and fe d it to the fuel control unit . The fuel 
control unit  control led the fuel flow rate to the fuel nozzle . The fuel nozzle convert ed the 
pressuri sed fuel into  a spray pattern and inject ed it into the combustion chamber . 
Engine controls  
3.9.8.  The engine controls were  designed to maintain a constant engine output shaft RPM10  to keep  
the rotor RPM  at 100% under varying loads .  
3.9.9.  The throttle was control led by the pilot with a twist -grip on the collective lever . It was set to 
either  the ground idle or full (flight idle) throttle position. The power turbine governor  and the 
fuel control unit  work ed together  to maintain the engine output shaft RPM  at 100% and  
anticipate the load indicated by  the collective lever position .  
3.9.10.  The fuel control unit  monitor ed the air pressure  at the compressor and control led the fuel flow 
to the fuel nozzle to maintain a constant pressure.   
3.9.11.  The power turbine governor  monitor ed the output  shaft RPM , which connect ed to the main 
rotor through the engine reduction gearing, sprag clutch and main transmission. The power 
turbine governor  generate d a pneumatic control signal to the fuel control unit  to maintain the 
output s haft RPM  at 100% . 
3.9.12.  If the automatic controls stabilise d at a point where output s haft RPM  was different from that 
desired, the pilot could  make small , incremental adjustments to correct it with a momentary -
action  toggle switch ( called the beep  switch) on the collective lever .   
Engine monitoring unit 
3.9.13.  The R66  engine was equipped with a digital engine monitoring unit (EMU). This continuously 
monitor ed four engine  parameters  and save d a digital  record for the entire life of the engine. 
The paramet ers were : the gas generator RPM11, the output shaft RPM ; the percentage of 
output torque  (torque ); and the average measured gas temperature  (gas temperature)12. An 
exceedance beyond the manufacture r's specified limitations for any of the four parameters 
was indicated to the pilot by a flashing cockpit caution light.  
3.9.14.  Digital d ata archived within the EMU could  be extracted in two formats : local maintenance 
personnel were  able to download simplified report s with details of any exceedances , while  
download ing the full spectrum of recorded data require d the Rolls -Royce proprietary software. 
The Commission obtained a copy of both data sets (Appendi ces 3 and 4 contain graph s 
produced from the downloaded EMU data) .

 3.10.  Tests and research  
Engine  
3.10.1.  The engine was initially inspected by a local licen sed aircraft engineer , then later by a Rolls -
Royce accident investigator. The engine was not disassembled , but a borescope was used to 
check for internal damage.   Some of the compressor blades had been  damaged when debris  
was ingested during the ground impact , but no further damage was found.  
Fuel contamination  
3.10.2.  Jet fuel as used in this engine type was normally clear  in appearance .  Residual fuel  recovered 
from  the engine fuel pump filter  housing , the fuel hose assembly  and the fuel nozzle showed 
signs of contamination  (Figure 5).  This was in the form of a fine sediment that partially 
remained in solution, giving the fuel a muddy brown colour, and partially settled as sludge  as 
shown in Figure 4 . The remaining fuel in the main tank was drained, measured and checked 
for water and other contamination.  None was found.  
3.10.3.  Fuel s amples taken from the engine, the helicopter fuel tank and the supply  tank  on the 
support vehicle  were  sent to  the Defence Technology Agency for analysis .  The results are 
discussed in section  4 of this report.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 Power turbine governor and fuel control unit 
3.10.4.  The power turbine governor  and fuel control unit  were removed from the engine  and sent  to 
the manufacturer (Honeywell Aerospace in the United States ) to be disassembled  and 
inspected under the supervision of the N ational Transportation Safety Board  on behalf of the 
Commission.  The inspections were  witnessed by Rolls -Royce representatives.  
3.10.5.  Functional testing of the power turbine go vernor  and fuel control unit  included a complete 'run 
as received ' test13.  Output signals  and fuel flow  at selected control setting positions  were also 
checked .  Both units operated as expected on the test bench , with n o 'out of limit ' or abnormal 
componen t conditions found.  No evidence of fuel contamination was found  within the units . 
Fuel nozzle  
3.10.6.  The fuel nozzle  was tested in New Zealand by a maintenance facilit y equipped  for and 
experienced in repairs of th is component .  The results are discussed in section  4. 
Sprag clutch  
3.10.7.  The function of the sprag clutch  was to isolate the engine from the rotor system during 
autorotative14 flight.   During the initial post -accident inspection of the aircraft, the sprag clutch 
was checked by manually rotating the output  shaft .  It operated correctly and was free to 
rotate.  
3.10.8.  The sprag clutch was removed from the aircraft and sent to an independent component 
overhaul facility15 to be stripped and inspected.   During that inspection one of the oil seals 
was found to be deform ed (Figure 6), the oil had drained out and internal fretting damage was 
observed  (Figure 7).  The mode of failure was notified to Robinson  Helicopters  and it carried 
out flight tests on another helicopter to determine if it was relevant to this accident .  Further 
details of the spr ag clutch fault and flight tests are provided  in section  4.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The pilot was forced to attempt a run -on landing when the helicopter had insufficient height 
and forward speed to recover from a low rotor RPM situation .  It was the second  low rotor RPM 
in quick succession.  
4.1.2.  The pilot said that the first RPM decrease  had been  dismissed as being a result of control 
inputs  demandi ng power more quickly than the engine was able to provide.  So when the rotor 
RPM recovered, the flight  was continued to descend and line up for the spray run . 
4.1.3.  The engine  was still operating during the initial impact with the ground and continue d to 
produc e power until the pilot shut it down.  
4.1.4.  This analysis discusses what could have caused  the two low rotor RPM events .  Data from the 
EMU  indicated  that a momentary reduction in available power occurred.  This is discussed in 
more detail below.  Consideration is also given to  whether  the faulty sprag clutch was a factor 
in the accid ent. 
4.1.5.  The analysis also discusses a safety issue whereby more educational material is needed to 
alert operators to the risk of contaminated fuel when operating and refuelling in remot e, dusty 
environments . 
4.2. Momentary reduction in  engine  power  
4.2.1.  The downloaded EMU data record was combined with position data obtained from the 
TracMap spray guidance system  to analys e the sequence of events leading up to and during 
the accident.  A graphic representation of the final minu te of EMU data is shown in Appendix 
3. 
4.2.2.  The two spray runs immediately before the accident flight were normal.   As shown in the graph 
in Appendix 4, the output shaft RPM  increased  to about 100% and was controlled to remain 
near that value until the pilot closed the throttle.  The graph also shows the torque increasing 
and decreasing  as the aerodynamic load changed throughout the flight .  The gas temperature  
follow ed the torque loading.  This demonstrates how the power  turbine governor  and fuel 
control unit  worked together to maintain output shaft RPM  at 100%.  
4.2.3.  The accident sequence started  first with a decrease  in the  gas temperature , followed by a 
decrease  in the gas generator RPM . The output shaft RPM  then decreased  to 94.4%.   During 
normal engine operation a decreasing output shaft RPM  would be detected by the power 
turbine governor , which would then signal the fuel control unit to schedule more fuel to 
increase the  output shaft  RPM. The addition of more fuel to the  engine would result in an 
increase in the gas temperature . 
4.2.4.  However, in this case both the gas producer RPM  and the output shaft RPM  were  initially 
decreasing , but the expected  corresponding increase in  the gas temperature  did not 
immediately occur.  This indicat es that the fuel flow had not been increased to correct the 
decrease  in output shaft RPM .  The output shaft RPM  was below the normal operating 
parameters  for approximately three  seconds before the gas temperature  started to increase . 
4.2.5.  The gas temperature  peaked  from th is initial recovery  then immediately began to decrease  
again .  The gas producer RPM  and output shaft RPM  followed the d ecrease  in gas 
temperature . At this point the pilot received  the second  low rotor RPM warning  and had no 
option but to  attempt a run-on landing . 
4.2.6.  The graph  shows  the point at which the mai n rotor blades struck the ground  as a spike in the 
torque value .  At the same time the gas temperature  increase d, and after approximately  three  
seconds the  output  shaft RPM  rapidly increased  and remained within the normal operating 
parameters for another five seconds until the engine was  shut down  by the pilot .  This rapid 
 
Final Report AO -2016 -008 
<< Page 13 >>
 increase in shaft RPM coincided with the partial loss of the main rotor blades after striking  the 
ground.  
4.2.7.  No mechanical defects were found in the engine , the power turbine governor  or the fuel 
control unit  that could  have prevent ed normal operation.  In the absence of any mechanical 
defects, the lack of an increasing  gas temperature  to correct the decrease  in RPM suggests 
that there was either insufficient fuel flow  available  or poor fuel quality .  
4.2.8.  There were  four possible  reasons for the low gas temperature:   
 the throttle was closed  
 fuel exhaustion  
 fuel control system fault  
 contamina ted fuel or r estricted fuel flow . 
4.2.9.  In relation to  the first point, c losing the twist -grip throttle would have result ed in a decrease  in 
engine  RPM  and temperature  similar to that seen in the EMU data.  
4.2.10.  The majority of the pilot's flight experience was flying  variants of Robinson  helicopters, all of 
which employ ed similar twist -grip throttle s. The same spray routine had been conduct ed for 
most of the day.  Therefore,  it is very unlikely that the pilot inadvertently closed the throttle at 
a time when more power  was being  demand ed to overcome a low rotor  RPM warning . 
4.2.11.  In relation to  the second point, i t is virtually certain that fuel exhaustion was not a factor . 
There were  at least 36 litres remaining in the fuel tank after the accident, which equated to 
approximately 24 minutes of run time16.  Also, t he engine continued to run until the pilot shut 
it down  manually , and wh en the eng ine was  later  inspected the fu el hose  leading to the fuel 
nozzle was still full of fuel.  
4.2.12.  In relation to  the third point, it is very unlikely  that a fault with the fuel control system  was a 
factor in the accident .  The power turbine governor  and fuel control unit  were removed from 
the engine and sent to Honeywell  Aerospace  for testing. They were visually inspected  then set 
up on test rig s and operated in the condition  in which  they had been  received.  After checking 
key control test point results, they were stripped and inspect ed for internal damage  or faults.   
No faults were found and the control settings were within normal toler ances.  No evidence of 
fuel contamination was found  in these two components .  
4.2.13.  Additionally, the fuel control unit  operat ed correctly by maintaining the output shaft RPM at 
100% immediately before the pilot shut down the engine .   
Contaminated fuel or r estricted fuel flow  
4.2.14.  During the engine investigation , contaminants were  found in : the fuel filter housing ( Figure 4); 
the fuel hose assembly  running to the fuel nozzle (Figure 5); and the fuel nozzle  itself .  With 
respect to these contaminants t he Defence Technology Agency  concluded:  
… the majority of particles were comprised mainly of silicon and aluminium with 
varying quantities of other metal elements such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, 
iron and zinc. The appearance and composition of the particles strongly suggest 
that they are an aluminosilicate cl ay material. Clays are common components of 
most soils.  
4.2.15.  The fuel nozzle was removed from the engine after the accident and tested by an independent 
maintenance provider  using the standard test procedure for a Rolls -Royce fuel nozzle .  More 
dried contaminants were found  within the fuel hose assembly  and the outer air shroud of the 
fuel nozzle. The nozzle was installed on a test rig to assess the spray pattern and flow rates at 
various fuel pressures , using clean fuel.  
                                                        
16 Civil Aviation Rules 137.65 requires a helicopter conducting agricultural operations to maintain minimum 
fuel reserves of "3 times the anticipated flight time or 30 minutes' flight time, whichever is the  lesser".  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO -2016 -008 4.2.16.  Some anomalies were apparent i n the spray pattern , which became  more defined as the fuel 
pressure was increased.  
4.2.17.  It is likely that  the anomalies  were the res ult of fine contaminates restricting the movement of 
the needle valve and slider within  the fuel nozzle's inner spray tip assemb ly.  The anomalies 
as observed may have caused some hot spots within the combustion chamber , but were 
unlikely to have been sufficient to cause the reduction in power that led to the low rotor  RPM . 
4.2.18.  The fuel sample  recovered from the hose  between the  fuel control unit  and the fuel nozzle was 
a muddy brown colour.  This contamination could have had t wo effects : either a slug of 
contaminated fuel passed into the combustion chamber that did not have the same heat 
output as clean fuel, or the sludge temporarily  restricted the fuel flow through the spray tip 
assembly  within the fuel nozzle .  Either scenario could have cause d a short -term reduction in 
available power.  
4.3. Source of fuel c ontamination  
Fuel filtering  
4.3.1.  The fuel samples taken from the helicopter main tank and from the supply tank on the support 
vehicle did not contain any of the contaminants found in the downst ream components, or any 
other impurities that would have been detrimental to the normal functioning of the engine.  
4.3.2.  Fuel-filtering elements are design ed to prevent contaminants  reach ing engine  components  
that could affect the normal running of an engine .  The engine  fuel filter element w as found to 
be clear of residue.   This is partially explained by the fact that t he engine fuel filter element 
had a nominal rating17 of five microns18 and an absolute rating19 of 15 microns , whereas  a 
high percentage of the contaminate particles found within the fuel hose assembly  were three 
to five microns, smaller than the filter rating .  A lesser number of larger partic les measur ed 
20-30 microns.  
4.3.3.  Installing  an additional airframe fuel filter  to provide secondary protection  is an option 
available on  other light turbine helicopters  when operating from unpaved surfaces .  Rolls -
Royce , on 7 February 2011, had  issued Notice to Operators - No: RR300 -015, recommending 
the fitting  of such additional fuel filters when :  
… operating aircraft from isolated locations where the fuel is stored in drums or 
similar extended fuel storage containers.  
4.3.4.  In relation to the  R66 helicopter, the  fuel system is gravity fed . Therefore, i nstalling  an 
additional airframe  fuel filter would restrict the fuel flow , potentially requiring  an additional 
fuel pump to maintain the required fuel pressure.  In view of thi s technical limitation , Robinson 
Helicopters has not developed an optional airframe fuel filter for the R66.  
4.3.5.  Operators of helicopters need to be alert to the risk of fuel contamination when operating in 
remote areas and mitigate the risk with  good fuel -handling procedures.

 Refuelling procedure s 
Safety issue: more educational material is needed to alert operators to the risk of 
contaminated fuel when operating and refuelling in remote , dusty environments.   
4.3.6.  The operat or's procedures left several oppor tunities for fuel contamination .  
4.3.7.  The operator 's fleet consisted of both turbine  and piston -engine helicopters that use d different 
fuel types .  Procedures  were in place to avoid cross -contamination of fuel types .  The fuel 
found in the accident helicopter was of the right t ype for the engine . 
4.3.8.  The operator's procedures for supplying  jet fuel to the helicop ter involved multiple transfers : 
 the jet fuel was purchased from a commercial supplier at the local airport and pumped 
into a 4 ,000-litre, truck -mounted fuel tank 
 from this tank, the fuel was pumped into a smaller supply  tank mounted on the back of 
the support vehicle  to enable  refuelling at  remote  sites 
 depending on the loading site, the helicopter would be refuelled  directly  from the 
smaller supply tank or from 20-litre fuel containers  
 the 20-litre fuel containers  were  refilled from the smaller supply  tank.  
4.3.9.  No contaminants were identified in the fuel supply path from  the bulk supply tanker at the 
operator's base  to the helicopter fuel tank  on the day .   
4.3.10.  The R66 fue l filler port  differ ed from that used on R 22 and R 44 helicopters .  The filler port 
was larger and sat flush within a flat area under a hinged cowling  (Figure 8).  The R 22 and 
R44 fuel ports , by comparison  (Figure 9), were  mounted on the top surface and had raise d 
edge s around them.  
4.3.11.  A foot  step for accessing and inspecting the rotor head was located adjacent  to the refuelling 
port on the R66.   This foot step  was a point where dirt could potentially accumulate. The pilot 
also made use of this  foot step  area to stow a fuel pourer spout .  The pilot said that the spout 
was always inspected before use . It was  nevertheless  a possible source of contamination.

4.3.12.  Another potential  point of contaminate ent ry was the fuel nozzle for the supply tank mounted 
on the support vehicle . The vehicle routinely operate d from gravel roads, paddocks and 
generally unpaved surfaces , but the nozzle was not covered or protected from contamination  
(Figure 10).  
 
4.3.13.  The frequent  refuelling cycles for this helicopter , with the engine running  and rotor  blade s 
turning in a dusty environment,  increased the risk of the fuel becoming contaminat ed.  This 
operating environment created the potential for a one -off fuel contamination event or for 
cumulative contamination to build up over time . 
4.3.14.  The operator had experienced two previous instances of fuel contamination with the accident 
helicopter , both  of which were  corrected by the maintenance provider.  The first instance had 
been on 10 August 2015 at 1,080 flight hours and the second on 15 January 2016 at 1,385 
flight hours. The maintenance provider had not analyse d the composition of the earlier 
contaminants, but described them as being different from  the clay found after the accident 
flight.  
4.3.15.  The pilot subsequently explained that the  earlier two incident s had been due to water in  a 
truck -mounted fuel t ank that initiated the growth of a fuel bug20. Corr ective action was 
reported to have include d: treating the fuel bug with a biocide21; draining and cleaning the  fuel 
tank; and raising awareness of  the water contamination issue at an internal safety meeting.   
4.3.16.  Three fuel contamination occurrences  in a 15-month  period  suggest that  opportunities existed 
to improv e the operator's fuel handling  practices . It is good practi ce for operator s to have 
documented  procedures, guidance material  and recorded training for the handling of aviation 
fuels .  The operator did not have any such documentation .

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 4.4. Sprag clutch  
4.4.1.  The investigation examined  whether the damage observed in the sprag clutch was a result of 
the accident or was a pre -existing condition that contributed to the decrease  in rotor RPM.  
4.4.2.  The Comm ission obtained the EMU data from the accident helicopter . This data was then 
forwarded  to Robinson Helicopters to compare with data from a test helicopter.  The engine 
RPM for both helicopters decreased  at about the same rate, which indicates that the accident 
helicopter sprag clutch was operating normally.  For the accident helicopter t he engine RPM 
was noted to decrease  faster tha n the main rotor RPM , which is considered normal .  The two 
RPM indications were  displayed on one gauge  in the cockpit,  which made a difference (or 
'RPM split ') immediately obvious  to a pilot .   
4.4.3.  If the sprag clutch had failed and been unable to disengage the driveline, the engine RPM 
would have decreased  at a slower rate on shut -down because it would still have been  driven 
by the rotor system.  Robinson Helicopters therefore con cluded  that the sprag clutch on the 
helicopter was functioning correctly the last time the helicopter was shut down.  
4.4.4.  For these reasons it is very unlikely that the damage found in the sprag clutch assembly 
contributed to the low rotor RPM event.  
4.4.5.  Turning to the issue of the damage found to the sprag clutch, t he shutdown procedure in the  
pilot's operating handbook22 include d a requirement for the pilot to confirm  that the sprag 
clutch ha d disengaged  by checking for the needle split indication on the co mbined 
engine/main rotor RPM gauge .  This was a daily check on sprag clutch performance.  
4.4.6.  No scheduled inspections of the sprag clutch were  prescribed in the maintenance manual. 
The sprag clutch was a life -limited component and a replacement was included in the 2,000-
hour  maintenance and inspection kit . 
4.4.7.  Robinson Helicopters advised that it was  aware of previous cases where the R66 sprag clutch 
oil seal had failed . The R66 sprag clutch had been  redesigned in November 2015 and the 
manufacturing process improved to prevent oil seal failure. The earlier -design sprag clutches 
were still performing their intended function and Robinson  Helicopters  was not aware of any 
functional problems  caused by  oil loss.  Consequently,  it did not see the need to issue  a 
service bulletin requir ing the immediate replacement of sprag clutch es.  All new and 
replacement units would be of the improved design.  
4.4.8.  A defect report detailing the condition of the sprag clutch was submitted to the C ivil Aviation 
Authority  by the component overhaul facility conducting the inspection.  
4.4.9.  In view of the above, the Commission saw no need to recommend any further action.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The accident occurred when the helicopter developed a condition of low rotor revolutions per 
minute when it did not have sufficient height and forward speed for the pilot to recover the 
situation.  
5.2. There was no mechanical fault found within the helicopter power plant that could have 
affected the engine perform ance.  
5.3. The condition of low rotor revolutions per minute  very likely resulted from  a momentary 
reduction in available engine power cause d by contaminated fuel . 
5.4. The operator's refuelling procedures for remote sites left several opportunities for fuel 
contami nation to occur.

 7. Safety actions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an o perator to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. None identified  
Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
7.3. A defect report detailing the condition of the sprag clutch was submitted to the Civil Aviation 
Authority  by the component overhaul facility conducting the inspection.  
7.4. Prior to this accident the R66 sprag clutch had been  redesigned and the manufacturing 
process improved to prevent oil seal failure.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the operator . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents oc curring in the 
future.  
Recommendation  to the Director of Civil Aviation  
8.3. This accident was the result of fine clay particles within the engine fuel system causing a 
momentar y reduction in engine power. Fuel  contamination is a greater risk for operators that 
conduct refuelling in the field or at remote locations.  
8.4. Clear g uidance material for remote refuelling procedures  is not readily accessibl e to general 
aviation  operators .  Advisory Circular AC91-22 and the Fuel Management - Good Aviation 
Practice booklet both contain some information  under the heading 'Fuelling Procedures '. 
However , this content is limited with regard to remote operations, mobile tanks, in -field fuel 
handling, crew training and  equipment recommendations.  
8.5. On 24 October 2018  the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation review 
and enhance all CAA -published guidance information to better inform  the industry on hazards 
associated with remote refuelling.   (027/18)  
On 8 November 2018, Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The CAA can confirm that recommendation 027/18 will be implemented as follows:  
All relevant information regarding remote refuelling will be placed on the CAA website 
by the end of November 2018.  
Advisory Circulars will be reviewed by the end of January 2019, and the updating of 
all documentation will be completed by end of February 2019 . 
Recommendation to the President of Aviation New Zealand  
8.6. This accident was the result of fine clay particles within the e ngine fuel system causing a 
momentary reduction in engine power. Fuel contamination is a greater risk for operators that 
conduct refuelling in the field or at remote locations.  
8.7. Clear guidance material for remote refuelling procedures is not readily access ible to general 
aviation operators. AC91 -22 and the Fuel Management - Good Aviation Practice booklet both 
contain some information under the heading 'Fuelling Procedures '. However, this content is 
limited with regard to remote operations, mobile tanks, in-field fuel handling, crew training and 
equipment recommendations.  
8.8. Aviation New Zealand represents the interests of the commercial aviation community, and the 
New Zealand Helicopter Association is a division of Aviation New Zealand .   
8.9. On 24 October 2018  the Commission recommended that the President of Aviation New 
Zealand promulgate the lessons learned from this accident to its members with a view to 
increasing awareness of the risk of fuel contamination during remote refuelling procedures .  
(028/18)  
On 2 7 November 2018, Aviation New Zealand replied:  
We accept the Aviation NZ recommendation in the referenced TAIC report; will be 
advising our members through the weekly newsletter, in the divisional newsletters to 
 
Final Report AO -2016 -008 
<< Page 23 >>
 the NZAAA  and NZHA  divisions as well as comm unicating it in divisional meetings; 
reaffirming it in the upcoming Council meeting; that we expect to finish these actions 
by the end of January;  and that we will ensure the importance of this issue is 
communicated through the safety seminars we will be r unning with members next 
year.

 Final Report AO -2016 -008 9. Key lessons  
9.1. Refuelling aircraft at remote locations increases the risk of fuel contamination.  Operators 
should take all precautions to prevent any debris entering the fuel supply chain , from the 
initial fuel supplier to the aircraft fuel tank . 
9.2. Aircraft fuel -filtering systems are an important defence against contaminated fuel causing an 
accident .  Where available , operators should consider fitting additional airframe filters to 
aircraft b eing operated and refuelled at remote locations.
