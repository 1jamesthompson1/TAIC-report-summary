Based on the information provided, the causes of the accident can be summarized as follows:

1. Missing sealant and hose clamp: A portion of the sealant had broken away, leaving a section of the primary vent hose connection exposed. This indicates a failure in the design and construction of the fuel system, as it did not adequately protect against hazards such as moving parts and hot surfaces.

2. Inadequate inspection of the fuel system: The survey reports did not show any inspection of the fuel system below the deck plate, and the surveyors did not identify that the secondary fuel tank vent was ineffective. The lack of specific regulatory requirements to survey the entire fuel system and the reliance on the surveyors' judgment have led to undetected high-risk deficiencies in fuel systems, increasing the potential for accidents.

3. Insufficient assurance of fuel system integrity and safety: The Maritime New Zealand survey system does not adequately assure the integrity and safety of fuel systems because the rules do not require the inspection of the complete fuel system. This lack of requirement increases the potential for hidden deficiencies and poses a potential risk to other vessels in the domestic fleet.

Overall, the accident highlights issues with the design, construction, and inspection of fuel systems, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring, periodic testing, and comprehensive inspections to ensure the safety and integrity of fuel systems on vessels.
