  \  \n4.1.1.  Suburban rail networks throughout  the world have long been th e target\
  \ of spray -paint attacks. \nThere is an active subculture that encourages and applauds\
  \ this activity, and the participants \nengage in it to obtain notoriety within\
  \ that subculture.   More recently the attacks have been  \nrecorded and uploaded\
  \ to social me dia, thereby reaching a potentially vast audience.  \n4.1.2.  The\
  \ act itself is not a safety issue that concerns the  Commission .  However, the\
  \ deliberate act \nof immobilising a passenger train in order to carry out an attack\
  \ highlighted potential safety \nand security vulnerabilities  within  the rail\
  \ passenger operation .  \n4.1.3.  It was in the context of these vulnerabilities\
  \ that the Commission opened  this inquiry .  \n4.1.4.  The following analysis discusses\
  \ the circumstances surrounding the unauthorised \nimmobilisation of the passenger\
  \ train.  The analysis then discusses a safety issue , that \nTransdev had no policies\
  \  or procedures in place to guide  its train crew in respond ing to \nunusual situations\
  \ . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  It was virtually certain  that activating the\
  \ emergency door release levers was a deliberate act \nto immobili se the train\
  \ to allow  the group  enough time to carry out their intent of spray -\npainting\
  \ the side of the train .  The incident was recorded on closed -circuit television\
  \ and \nreveal ed members of the group running directly to the  emergency door release\
  \ panels and \nactivating the levers while the train was still slowing down at the\
  \ platform.  \n4.2.2.  Several calls were made to  the P olice by passengers on\
  \ the train while the group was carrying \nout the attack.  The train crew did not\
  \ call the Police .  Instead , the driver notified train control \nand the train\
  \ manager  notified the Transdev Operations Centre . \n4.2.3.  Both the train manager\
  \  and the driver stayed on  board the train while the group was present \nand did\
  \ not confront the m in any way.  \n4.2.4.  The Police communications centre dispatched\
  \ several Police units to the area to set up a \ncordon surrounding Baldwin Avenue\
  \ Station.  In acc ordance with Police procedure , officers \nwere not sent directly\
  \  to the platform to confront the large group until more  information had \nbeen\
  \ gathered from people at the scene.  \n4.2.5.  The group continued to spray -paint\
  \ the train and completely covered the side of the passenger \ncars facing the platform\
  \ in about seven minutes .  This took until 1645,  whereupon the  group  \nescaped\
  \ along  the rail corridor , avoiding the Police cordon . \n4.3. Emergency door\
  \ release  \n4.3.1.  The emergency door releases had been  fitted at the time of\
  \ the train's manufacture in Spain  \nand designed to comply with European Union\
  \ standards.  The devices were  located on the \nexterior of the train and their\
  \ purpose was to enable rescuers  to access the train in the event \nof an emergency\
  \ . \n4.3.2.  The purpose of an emergency  door release is not to stop a train .\
  \  It is intended for use only \nwhile a train is at a standstill.  It does not\
  \ have any effect on the train braking system.  It is a \ndevice that releas es\
  \ the locking mechanisms on the connected  set of train doors.  The doors \nmay\
  \ then be opened manually in the event that they cannot be operated internally by\
  \ the train \ncrew. \n4.3.3.  Once an emergency  door release  is activated it is\
  \ recognised by the train's computer system, \nwhich sends an alarm to the driver\
  \ and simultaneously removes traction power to the wheels  \nFinal Report RO -2017\
  \ -104 \n<< Page 7 >>\n to prevent the train moving off from a standstill with the\
  \ doors potentially open .  The brakes \nare not automatically activated (see Figure\
  \ 5).  \n \nFigure 5 \nSequence  of events upon activation  of emergency door release\
  \  (EDR = emergency door release)  \n4.3.4.  An emergency  door release is not intended\
  \  for use while a train is moving.  However, t he driver \nis able to override\
  \ the system if necessary and move the train if circumstances dictate .  \nMoving\
  \ a train with a n emergency  door release activated creates two hazards: people\
  \ could \nfall from the train through doors that can be opened manually (or that\
  \ could be open already) ; \nand the metal access cover will protrud e from the\
  \ side of the passenger car, present ing a \nhazard to people or objects outside\
  \ the train (see Figure 6). \n\n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -104  \n\
  Figure 6 \nEmergency door release  cover panel protru ding from car  \n4.3.5.  Both\
  \ Europe (where the trains were designed and built) and the United States have similar\
  \ \nphilosophies for protect ing the emergency door release from accidental activation\
  \ or \ndeliberate misuse.  \n4.3.6.  Railway Group Standard GM/RT 2473 Para B10.1\
  \  (Rail Safety and Standards Board (United \nKingdom))  state d in part:  \nEach\
  \ device \u2026 shall be  protected to dete r abuse and accidental operation.  \n\
  4.3.7.  The United States ' Code  of Federal Regulations Title 49 (Transportation)\
  \  (Federal Railroad \nAdministration's Office of Railroad Safety)  state d in part:\
  \  \nThe rail operator may protect these emergency door opening devices by placing\
  \ a \ncover or screen ove r the devices. These covers must be capable of being removed\
  \ \nwithout the use of any tool or implement . \n4.3.8.  The location of an emergency\
  \ door release  on the side of a train is to provide ease of access \nto authorised\
  \ personnel. Different types of rolling stock locate emergency door release s in\
  \ less \naccessible posit ions, such as underneath the bodies of passenger cars,\
  \ to deter unauthorised \nuse. \n4.3.9.  A safety report  titled Train Door Emergency\
  \ Egress and Access and Emergency Evacuation \nProcedures  was published in New\
  \ South Wales, Australia  (Independent Transport Safety & \nReliability Regulator,\
  \ 2004) . The recommendations of that  report are reproduced in part \nbelow:  \n\
  \nFinal Report RO -2017 -104 \n<< Page 9 >>\n In lig ht of reviewed accident reports\
  \ and the standards in place in other developed \ncountries, it is the recommendation\
  \ of the project team that passengers should have \nthe means to escape a train\
  \ of their own accord if  the situation is serious enough to \nwarrant it. This\
  \ will entail the installation of emergency door opening devices. The \nrisks associated\
  \ with vandalism and passengers escaping into an unsafe \nenvironment are recognised\
  \ and should be taken into account when  implementing \nthis recommendation.  \n\
  It is recommended that external emergency door release mechanisms should be \naccessible\
  \ without the use of a key and clearly identified. The abbreviation \"EDR\" is \n\
  not recognised by all members of the emergency services and  it would be virtually\
  \ \nimpossible to train all personnel. The issue of emergency responders being delayed\
  \ \nin accessing the train is a recurring theme throughout several of the accident\
  \ \nreports.  \nTo prevent unauthorised access to the train when it is stabled ,\
  \ the train should be \nlocked so that it is secure and the emergency door release\
  \ mechanism rendered \ninoperative. The locking system should be designed in such\
  \ a way that it is \nimpossible to move the train while the release mechanism remains\
  \ inoperative, i. e. it \nshould not depend on crew remembering to reactivate the\
  \ release mechanism.  \nIn recommending that the facility should exist for passengers\
  \ to open doors, the \npossibility of vandalism and inappropriate use of the door\
  \ -opening device must be \nrecognised. There are very real dangers associated with\
  \ passengers opening doors \nwhen the train is moving, as well as that of escaping\
  \ onto nearby tracks where there \nis the hazard posed by oncoming trains. As a\
  \ result,  the following parameters should \nbe incorporated i nto the installation\
  \ of door opening devices:  \na) The doors should be locked  when the train is moving.\
  \ The doors should lock \nautomatically when the train is about to commence to move.\
  \ This will guard \nagainst people opening doors and falling out when the train\
  \ is moving.  \nb) [not relevant to this report]  \nc) The emergency door opening\
  \ devi ce located in the carriages must be designed \nand positioned  such that\
  \ it cannot be operated accidentally.  \nd) The emergency door opening device should\
  \ be guarded in such a way that it will \ndiscourage as far as possible acts of\
  \ vandalism. There must be some typ e of \ncover or barrier over the device and\
  \ it would be possible for the device to be \nalarmed so if it is tampered with,\
  \ the crew would be alerted.  \ne) There should be a suitable penalty imposed for\
  \ those persons found guilty of \ntampering with safety equipment a nd/or emergency\
  \ door opening devices. This is \na crime of a different nature from that associated\
  \ with acts of vandalism such as \ngraffiti, rather this is a crime that endangers\
  \ public safety.  \nf) Train crew emergency procedures and training will need to\
  \ be revi ewed to \nencompass any new equipment and procedures that resul t from\
  \ a change to \ndoor policy.  \n4.3.10.  The design of the emergency door release\
  \ s on the Auckland trains meet s the intent of these \nrecommendations .  Notwithstanding\
  \ this, the owner  is currently assessing  whether further \nmeasures could be taken\
  \ to further deter unauthorised activation of the emergency door \nreleases . \n\
  4.3.11.  It is not easy to strike  the right design balance between deterring unauthorised\
  \ use of the \nemergency door release system and allowing entry a nd egress in an\
  \ emergency .  However, in \nthe circumstances of this incident it is unlikely that\
  \ any design deterrent would have \nprevented the group carrying out a planned immobili\
  \ sation of the train.  \n  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -104 4.4.\
  \ Response to the incident  \nSafety issue - Transdev  had no policies or procedures\
  \ in place to guide its train  crew  in respond ing to \nunusual situations . \n\
  4.4.1.  The crew on  board the immobilised train were faced with a n unusual  dilemma\
  \ .  Their prime \nresponsibility was for the safety of the passengers, but they\
  \ were  also faced with  a group of \npeople intent on damaging the train , which\
  \ could have potentially put the passengers at risk.  \n4.4.2.  The driver was aware\
  \ from training that the emergency door release alarm could be bypassed \nand the\
  \ train moved to a safe place .  The d river did not consider taking this course\
  \ of action  \nfor two reasons:  \n\uF0B7 the driver thought  that it would first\
  \ require perm ission from the train maintenance \nprovider  \n\uF0B7 the driver\
  \  was aware that train control had place d the signal ahead at stop .4 This was\
  \ \ndone  to avoid the level -crossing alarms at the nearby road  activating early.\
  \  \n4.4.3.  Both the driver and the train manager  stated that they had not been\
  \ trained to ring 111.  Their \nunderstanding was that their responsibility was\
  \ to inform the respective control centr es.  The \nconsequence s of this action\
  \ are discussed in the following section.  \n4.4.4.  The train manager did not make\
  \ an announcement to passengers over the train's public \naddress system because\
  \  it was  considered that there was not enough time and that the \npassenger s\
  \ could already see what was happening.  \n4.4.5.  Transdev operates under KiwiRail's\
  \ Rail Operating Rules and Procedures , which state d in part:  \n5. Unusual Circumstances\
  \   \n\uF0B7 Not provided for  \nWhen circumstances occur when [sic] are not provided\
  \ for  in rules, regulations or \ninstructions, Rail Personnel must be guided by\
  \ their own judgement, bearing in mind \nthe importance of safety in the discharge\
  \ of their duty.  \n4.4.6.  At the time of this incident Tran sdev was writing procedures\
  \ for staff to follow in the e vent of \nvarious physical threats.  However, these\
  \ procedures had yet to be included in any formal \ntraining package for train crews.\
  \  \n4.4.7.  In the circumstances of this incident the train crew took a safe option\
  \  of not acknowledging \nthe group on the platform and k eeping the passengers\
  \ on  board the train.  This avoided the \npotential for physical confrontation.\
  \  \n4.4.8.  However, i t was likely that this course of action was taken simply\
  \ because the train crew w as \nnot trained in alternative options .  In different\
  \ circumstances the crew might need  to take \nalternative action .  Guidance on\
  \ the options  that might suit various scenarios would be useful \nto train crews.\
  \  \n4.4.9.  The Commission has made a recommendation to Transdev Auckland to improve\
  \ the quality of \ntraining for train crews , including training on liaising with\
  \ emergency services , so that they are \nbetter equipped to respond to unusual\
  \ situations.  \n4.5. Incident reporting   \n4.5.1.  New Zealand Police has policies\
  \ and procedures for dealing with high -level safety and security \nevents involving\
  \ the metropolitan train system .  The Police response to this event was \nconsistent\
  \ with the event as it was reported .   \n                                     \
  \                   \n4 This was done to avoid the road  level -crossing alarms\
  \ ahead of the train activating early.  If the alarms had activated \nwith the train\
  \ stopped for an extended period at the platform, road traffic would have built\
  \ up and created the potential \nfor road users to become frustrated and attem pt\
  \ to drive through the activated level crossing.  \nFinal Report RO -2017 -104 \n\
  << Page 11 >>\n 4.5.2.  The gathering of information by the Police was potentially\
  \ hampered by a lack  of knowledge  of \nthe geographical location of the train.\
  \   The passengers sitting i n the train who called the P olice \ndid not know any\
  \ nearby streets to use as a reference and the Police communications centre \ncall-takers\
  \ on this occasion were  unfamiliar with the location s of stations on the metropolitan\
  \ \nrail network.  \n4.5.3.  The computer -assisted di spatc h system used by the\
  \ Police communications centre had the \nability to overlay train stations on the\
  \ general working map  to assist staff to locate a train  if \nrequired . \n4.5.4.\
  \  Since this  incident Police communications centres have gained the ability  to\
  \ pinpoint caller \nlocations using the geograph ical locating technology  available\
  \ in conjunction with  most mobile \ntelephones . \n4.5.5.  As neither the driver\
  \ nor the train manager  contacted the Police communications centre \ndirectly ,\
  \ the call takers were receiving some of the information from parties who were not\
  \ at \nthe scene, and that information was in some cases being relayed third hand.\
  \  \n4.5.6.  A Police call taker obtained the train manager 's phone number and\
  \ rang them directly. At that \ntime the train man ager was actively engaged in\
  \ managing the passengers  and was unable to \nprovide the level of information\
  \ the call taker required.  \n4.5.7.  On being advised of the incident by the train\
  \ driver, the train co ntroller offered to ring the \nPolice . An extended  conversation\
  \  then took place between the train driver, the train controller \nand the Police\
  \ communications centre call taker .  The train controller was relaying questions\
  \ \nfrom the P olice by radio to the train driver, then relaying the driver's answers\
  \ by telephone to \nthe Police.  \n4.5.8.  Had the train crew  contacted emergency\
  \ services directly , it is likely that the necessary \ninformation would have been\
  \ passed on with more accuracy  and in a timelier  fashion.  \n4.5.9.  This incident\
  \ shows the importance of clear and concise information being forwarded to \nemergency\
  \ services by those best placed to report the actual circumstances. An incorrect\
  \ \ndescription  of an event could have safety consequences in cases where the intended\
  \ outcome \nof the event  is more serious.  For example, a direct repo rt from the\
  \ driver  in this case \nexplaining that the train had been disabled by a group\
  \ of masked individuals would likely have \ngiven the first responders a better\
  \ appreciation of the seriousness of the event.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>"
