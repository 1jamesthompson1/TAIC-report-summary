The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and  
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occ urrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
membe rs of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 1638 o n Sunday 17 September 2017, an Auckland metropolitan passenger train was 
travelling eastbound from Swanson to Britomart Transport Centre  with a train driver, a train 
manager and about 40 passengers on board.  
1.2. As the train approached Baldwin Avenue Station , a group of people on the station platform 
wearing masks disabled the train by pulling the emergency door release levers on the outside 
of the train.  The group then  spray -painted on e side of the train before escaping along the rail 
corridor.  
1.3. The train doors remained closed throughout the event  and the passengers were kept on 
board .  Nobody was injured and damage was confined to spray -painting one side of the train . 
1.4. The Transport Accident I nvestigation Commission (Commission) found  that the design and 
installation of the emergency door release levers on the Auckland metropolitan trains met the 
recommended industry standards, and found that the design achieved an appropriate balance 
between deterring unauthorised use and allowing the doors to be opened from outside the 
passenger cars . 
1.5. The Commission also found  that the emergency response to the incident was appropriate for 
the circumstances based on  the informat ion that was reported . The response to the incident 
would likely have been more efficient if the train crew involved had spoken directly with the 
Police communications centre .  
1.6. The Commission identified one safety issue : Transdev Auckland Limited had no po licies or 
procedures in place to guide its train crew in respond ing to unusual situations . 
1.7. The Commission recommended  that Tran sdev Auckland Limited  improve the quality of training 
for train crews , including  training on liaising with emergency services , so that they are better 
prepared to respond to unusual situations.  
1.8. A key lesson  arising from the inquiry is  that in any emergency situation, it is important that 
clear, concise and timely information be given to first responders so that a fast and efficie nt 
response can be planned and executed.

 Final Report RO -2017 -104 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 18 September 2017  the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) 
learned  of the incident  through the media . The Commission opened an inquiry under section 
13(1)b of the Tran sport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an 
investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 4 October 2017 Commission investigators conducted a site examination at Baldwin 
Avenue Station . 
2.3. The i nvestigators also visited : the rolling stock maintenance workshops ; the Auckland 
Transport Operations Centre ; the Transdev  Auckland Limited (Transdev)  Operations Centre ; 
and the Police Northern Communications Centre .  
2.4. On 5 October 2017 investigators interviewed the train driver, the train manager, the Transdev 
manager of security and the Transdev training manager . 
2.5. The Commission obtained the following documents and records:  
 the signalling and interlocking diagram  for Baldwin Avenue Station  
 witness statements and interviews  
 the training records for the train crew  
 details of training programmes for train crew  
 closed -circuit television  video recording s of the incident  
 recordings of telephone calls to and from the Police communications centre  relevant to the 
incident . 
2.6. On 25 October 2018  the Commission approved the draft report for distribution to 12 
interested persons for comment . 
2.7. The Commission received submissions from five interested persons.  Any changes resulting 
from those submissions have been included in this final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Sunday 17 September 2017, a passenger train was  travelling eastbound from Swanson  to 
Britomart Transport Centre.   The train was crewed  by a train driver (the driver) and a train 
manager , both employees of Transdev .  
3.1.2.  The train approached  Baldwin Avenue Station at about 16 38 for a scheduled  stop.  There 
were  about 40 passengers on board.  
3.1.3.  The driver was slowing the train in preparation to stop at  the station  and noticed a group of 
about 12 people gathered on a  pathway leading to the platform.  The group attracted the 
driver's attention because they were wearing masks covering their faces . 
3.1.4.  The driver would normally have activate d a door release fro m the driving cab once the train 
stopped  at the platform , which would then have allow ed the train manag er to open the doors.  
Being unsure of the group's intentions, the driver decided to not activate  the door release 
when the train stopped . 
3.1.5.  However, before the train stopped o ne of the masked group  jogged  alongside the moving 
train, opened the cover to the emergency door release2 panel on the third  passenger car and 
pulled the lever  (see Figure 2 ).  Two other  members of the group  pulled  the identical  levers on 
the other two passenger cars as the train came to a stop at the platform.

3.1.6.  Activating the  emergency door release levers caused  the train door locking mechanis ms to 
release , which meant that the doors could  then be opened  by hand with minimal eff ort. 
3.1.7.  Pulling a lever also initiated a n alarm  in the driving cab,  which alerted  the driver that a  lever 
had been activated  (see F igure 3).

3.1.8.  The group began spray -painting the en tire platform side of the train while  one member of the 
group videoed the activity.  
3.1.9.  The train manager  instructed  the passengers to stay on  the train to avoid any poten tial 
confrontation.  
3.1.10.  The driver contacted train control by radio to report what was happening and informed the 
controller  that the train would be delayed.   At the same time t he train manager  contacted the 
Transdev  Operations Centre  and reported the situation , which  in turn contacted the Police 
communications centre . 
3.1.11.  The Police communications centre received several 1113 calls from passengers on  board the 
train .  Police units were dispatched to the area around Baldwin Avenue Station.   
3.1.12.  The group of masked people continued spray -paint ing the side of the train for about seven 
minutes .  They then  escaped  along the rail  corridor  towards Mount Albert  (see Figure 4 ).

3.1.13.  At 1648, having been stopped for a total of 10 minutes, the train crew considered it was safe  
for the doors to be  opened for those  passengers wishing to disembark .  The train crew  then 
carried out an inspection of the train.  
3.1.14.  Due to t he extent of the spray -paint covering the windows and doors , the train crew deemed it 
unsafe to continue any further as a revenue service . All remaining passengers were then 
disembarked  on to the platform  to await the arrival of the next train , which was due to arrive in 
19 minutes.  
3.1.15.  The train was placed out  of service .  The emergency door release levers were reset by the train 
crew  and the train was then taken to the Wiri maintenance depot for cleaning.  
3.2. Key personnel  
3.2.1.  The train driver had first t rained  as a driver with Transdev Auckland in 2013 .  The driver had 
previously driven trains  for a different company.  The d river's certification was current.   
3.2.2.  The train manager had been  first certified for duties with Transdev Auckland in 2008 .  The 
train manager 's responsibilities included  the security of the train and the safety of the 
passengers , for which conflict awareness training had been provided in 2014.

 Final Report RO -2017 -104 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Suburban rail networks throughout  the world have long been th e target of spray -paint attacks. 
There is an active subculture that encourages and applauds this activity, and the participants 
engage in it to obtain notoriety within that subculture.   More recently the attacks have been  
recorded and uploaded to social me dia, thereby reaching a potentially vast audience.  
4.1.2.  The act itself is not a safety issue that concerns the  Commission .  However, the deliberate act 
of immobilising a passenger train in order to carry out an attack highlighted potential safety 
and security vulnerabilities  within  the rail passenger operation .  
4.1.3.  It was in the context of these vulnerabilities that the Commission opened  this inquiry .  
4.1.4.  The following analysis discusses the circumstances surrounding the unauthorised 
immobilisation of the passenger train.  The analysis then discusses a safety issue , that 
Transdev had no policies  or procedures in place to guide  its train crew in respond ing to 
unusual situations . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  It was virtually certain  that activating the emergency door release levers was a deliberate act 
to immobili se the train to allow  the group  enough time to carry out their intent of spray -
painting the side of the train .  The incident was recorded on closed -circuit television and 
reveal ed members of the group running directly to the  emergency door release panels and 
activating the levers while the train was still slowing down at the platform.  
4.2.2.  Several calls were made to  the P olice by passengers on the train while the group was carrying 
out the attack.  The train crew did not call the Police .  Instead , the driver notified train control 
and the train manager  notified the Transdev Operations Centre . 
4.2.3.  Both the train manager  and the driver stayed on  board the train while the group was present 
and did not confront the m in any way.  
4.2.4.  The Police communications centre dispatched several Police units to the area to set up a 
cordon surrounding Baldwin Avenue Station.  In acc ordance with Police procedure , officers 
were not sent directly  to the platform to confront the large group until more  information had 
been gathered from people at the scene.  
4.2.5.  The group continued to spray -paint the train and completely covered the side of the passenger 
cars facing the platform in about seven minutes .  This took until 1645,  whereupon the  group  
escaped along  the rail corridor , avoiding the Police cordon . 
4.3. Emergency door release  
4.3.1.  The emergency door releases had been  fitted at the time of the train's manufacture in Spain  
and designed to comply with European Union standards.  The devices were  located on the 
exterior of the train and their purpose was to enable rescuers  to access the train in the event 
of an emergency . 
4.3.2.  The purpose of an emergency  door release is not to stop a train .  It is intended for use only 
while a train is at a standstill.  It does not have any effect on the train braking system.  It is a 
device that releas es the locking mechanisms on the connected  set of train doors.  The doors 
may then be opened manually in the event that they cannot be operated internally by the train 
crew. 
4.3.3.  Once an emergency  door release  is activated it is recognised by the train's computer system, 
which sends an alarm to the driver and simultaneously removes traction power to the wheels  
Final Report RO -2017 -104 
<< Page 7 >>
 to prevent the train moving off from a standstill with the doors potentially open .  The brakes 
are not automatically activated (see Figure 5).  
 
Figure 5 
Sequence  of events upon activation  of emergency door release  (EDR = emergency door release)  
4.3.4.  An emergency  door release is not intended  for use while a train is moving.  However, t he driver 
is able to override the system if necessary and move the train if circumstances dictate .  
Moving a train with a n emergency  door release activated creates two hazards: people could 
fall from the train through doors that can be opened manually (or that could be open already) ; 
and the metal access cover will protrud e from the side of the passenger car, present ing a 
hazard to people or objects outside the train (see Figure 6).

Figure 6

4.3.5.  Both Europe (where the trains were designed and built) and the United States have similar 
philosophies for protect ing the emergency door release from accidental activation or 
deliberate misuse.  
4.3.6.  Railway Group Standard GM/RT 2473 Para B10.1  (Rail Safety and Standards Board (United 
Kingdom))  state d in part:  
Each device … shall be  protected to dete r abuse and accidental operation.  
4.3.7.  The United States ' Code  of Federal Regulations Title 49 (Transportation)  (Federal Railroad 
Administration's Office of Railroad Safety)  state d in part:  
The rail operator may protect these emergency door opening devices by placing a 
cover or screen ove r the devices. These covers must be capable of being removed 
without the use of any tool or implement . 
4.3.8.  The location of an emergency door release  on the side of a train is to provide ease of access 
to authorised personnel. Different types of rolling stock locate emergency door release s in less 
accessible posit ions, such as underneath the bodies of passenger cars, to deter unauthorised 
use. 
4.3.9.  A safety report  titled Train Door Emergency Egress and Access and Emergency Evacuation 
Procedures  was published in New South Wales, Australia  (Independent Transport Safety & 
Reliability Regulator, 2004) . The recommendations of that  report are reproduced in part 
below:  

Final Report RO -2017 -104 
<< Page 9 >>
 In lig ht of reviewed accident reports and the standards in place in other developed 
countries, it is the recommendation of the project team that passengers should have 
the means to escape a train of their own accord if  the situation is serious enough to 
warrant it. This will entail the installation of emergency door opening devices. The 
risks associated with vandalism and passengers escaping into an unsafe 
environment are recognised and should be taken into account when  implementing 
this recommendation.  
It is recommended that external emergency door release mechanisms should be 
accessible without the use of a key and clearly identified. The abbreviation "EDR" is 
not recognised by all members of the emergency services and  it would be virtually 
impossible to train all personnel. The issue of emergency responders being delayed 
in accessing the train is a recurring theme throughout several of the accident 
reports.  
To prevent unauthorised access to the train when it is stabled , the train should be 
locked so that it is secure and the emergency door release mechanism rendered 
inoperative. The locking system should be designed in such a way that it is 
impossible to move the train while the release mechanism remains inoperative, i. e. it 
should not depend on crew remembering to reactivate the release mechanism.  
In recommending that the facility should exist for passengers to open doors, the 
possibility of vandalism and inappropriate use of the door -opening device must be 
recognised. There are very real dangers associated with passengers opening doors 
when the train is moving, as well as that of escaping onto nearby tracks where there 
is the hazard posed by oncoming trains. As a result,  the following parameters should 
be incorporated i nto the installation of door opening devices:  
a) The doors should be locked  when the train is moving. The doors should lock 
automatically when the train is about to commence to move. This will guard 
against people opening doors and falling out when the train is moving.  
b) [not relevant to this report]  
c) The emergency door opening devi ce located in the carriages must be designed 
and positioned  such that it cannot be operated accidentally.  
d) The emergency door opening device should be guarded in such a way that it will 
discourage as far as possible acts of vandalism. There must be some typ e of 
cover or barrier over the device and it would be possible for the device to be 
alarmed so if it is tampered with, the crew would be alerted.  
e) There should be a suitable penalty imposed for those persons found guilty of 
tampering with safety equipment a nd/or emergency door opening devices. This is 
a crime of a different nature from that associated with acts of vandalism such as 
graffiti, rather this is a crime that endangers public safety.  
f) Train crew emergency procedures and training will need to be revi ewed to 
encompass any new equipment and procedures that resul t from a change to 
door policy.  
4.3.10.  The design of the emergency door release s on the Auckland trains meet s the intent of these 
recommendations .  Notwithstanding this, the owner  is currently assessing  whether further 
measures could be taken to further deter unauthorised activation of the emergency door 
releases . 
4.3.11.  It is not easy to strike  the right design balance between deterring unauthorised use of the 
emergency door release system and allowing entry a nd egress in an emergency .  However, in 
the circumstances of this incident it is unlikely that any design deterrent would have 
prevented the group carrying out a planned immobili sation of the train.

 Final Report RO -2017 -104 4.4. Response to the incident  
Safety issue - Transdev  had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train  crew  in respond ing to 
unusual situations . 
4.4.1.  The crew on  board the immobilised train were faced with a n unusual  dilemma .  Their prime 
responsibility was for the safety of the passengers, but they were  also faced with  a group of 
people intent on damaging the train , which could have potentially put the passengers at risk.  
4.4.2.  The driver was aware from training that the emergency door release alarm could be bypassed 
and the train moved to a safe place .  The d river did not consider taking this course of action  
for two reasons:  
 the driver thought  that it would first require perm ission from the train maintenance 
provider  
 the driver  was aware that train control had place d the signal ahead at stop .4 This was 
done  to avoid the level -crossing alarms at the nearby road  activating early.  
4.4.3.  Both the driver and the train manager  stated that they had not been trained to ring 111.  Their 
understanding was that their responsibility was to inform the respective control centr es.  The 
consequence s of this action are discussed in the following section.  
4.4.4.  The train manager did not make an announcement to passengers over the train's public 
address system because  it was  considered that there was not enough time and that the 
passenger s could already see what was happening.  
4.4.5.  Transdev operates under KiwiRail's Rail Operating Rules and Procedures , which state d in part:  
5. Unusual Circumstances   
 Not provided for  
When circumstances occur when [sic] are not provided for  in rules, regulations or 
instructions, Rail Personnel must be guided by their own judgement, bearing in mind 
the importance of safety in the discharge of their duty.  
4.4.6.  At the time of this incident Tran sdev was writing procedures for staff to follow in the e vent of 
various physical threats.  However, these procedures had yet to be included in any formal 
training package for train crews.  
4.4.7.  In the circumstances of this incident the train crew took a safe option  of not acknowledging 
the group on the platform and k eeping the passengers on  board the train.  This avoided the 
potential for physical confrontation.  
4.4.8.  However, i t was likely that this course of action was taken simply because the train crew w as 
not trained in alternative options .  In different circumstances the crew might need  to take 
alternative action .  Guidance on the options  that might suit various scenarios would be useful 
to train crews.  
4.4.9.  The Commission has made a recommendation to Transdev Auckland to improve the quality of 
training for train crews , including training on liaising with emergency services , so that they are 
better equipped to respond to unusual situations.  
4.5. Incident reporting   
4.5.1.  New Zealand Police has policies and procedures for dealing with high -level safety and security 
events involving the metropolitan train system .  The Police response to this event was 
consistent with the event as it was reported .   
                                                        
4 This was done to avoid the road  level -crossing alarms ahead of the train activating early.  If the alarms had activated 
with the train stopped for an extended period at the platform, road traffic would have built up and created the potential 
for road users to become frustrated and attem pt to drive through the activated level crossing.

 4.5.2.  The gathering of information by the Police was potentially hampered by a lack  of knowledge  of 
the geographical location of the train.   The passengers sitting i n the train who called the P olice 
did not know any nearby streets to use as a reference and the Police communications centre 
call-takers on this occasion were  unfamiliar with the location s of stations on the metropolitan 
rail network.  
4.5.3.  The computer -assisted di spatc h system used by the Police communications centre had the 
ability to overlay train stations on the general working map  to assist staff to locate a train  if 
required . 
4.5.4.  Since this  incident Police communications centres have gained the ability  to pinpoint caller 
locations using the geograph ical locating technology  available in conjunction with  most mobile 
telephones . 
4.5.5.  As neither the driver nor the train manager  contacted the Police communications centre 
directly , the call takers were receiving some of the information from parties who were not at 
the scene, and that information was in some cases being relayed third hand.  
4.5.6.  A Police call taker obtained the train manager 's phone number and rang them directly. At that 
time the train man ager was actively engaged in managing the passengers  and was unable to 
provide the level of information the call taker required.  
4.5.7.  On being advised of the incident by the train driver, the train co ntroller offered to ring the 
Police . An extended  conversation  then took place between the train driver, the train controller 
and the Police communications centre call taker .  The train controller was relaying questions 
from the P olice by radio to the train driver, then relaying the driver's answers by telephone to 
the Police.  
4.5.8.  Had the train crew  contacted emergency services directly , it is likely that the necessary 
information would have been passed on with more accuracy  and in a timelier  fashion.  
4.5.9.  This incident shows the importance of clear and concise information being forwarded to 
emergency services by those best placed to report the actual circumstances. An incorrect 
description  of an event could have safety consequences in cases where the intended outcome 
of the event  is more serious.  For example, a direct repo rt from the driver  in this case 
explaining that the train had been disabled by a group of masked individuals would likely have 
given the first responders a better appreciation of the seriousness of the event.

 Final Report RO -2017 -104 5. Findings  
5.1. A gro up of people on the station platform activated the emergency door release levers on the 
outside of the train, which disengaged traction driving power and prevented the train  
departing until the group had completed their act of  spray -painting the side of th e train . 
5.2. The design and installation of the emergency  door release levers on the Auckland 
metropolitan trains  achieved an appropriate balance between deterring unauthorised use and 
allowing the doors to be opened from outside the passenger cars , and met the recommended 
industry standards.  
5.3. The emergency  response to the incident  was appropriate for the circumstances and the 
information that was reported . 
5.4. First respon ders would likely have been better informed as to the seriousness of the even t if 
the train crew involved had spoken directly with the Police communications centre .

 Final Report RO -2017 -104 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Comm ission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an  inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other issues that would 
not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety actions to address safety issues that would otherwise have resulted in a  
recommendation  
None identified.  
7.3. Safety a ctions  taken to address other issues  
None identified.

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , a recommendation  has been issued to Transdev Auckland . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that th is recommendation  is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendation  
8.3. The training that the  train crew  had received was  limited to conflict avoidanc e and did not 
provide them with the skills to deal with wider security scenarios.  
8.4. The action the train crew took on this occasion was appropriate.  However, the crew was not 
trained  in alternative options.  In different circumstances the crew might need  to take 
alternative action.  Guidance on the options that might suit various scenarios would be useful 
to train crews.  
On 21 February 2019  the Commission recommended that Transdev Auc kland improve the 
quality of training for train crews , including training on liaising with emergency services , so 
that they are better prepared to  respond to unusual situations.   (001/19)  
On 5 March 2019, the Transdev  Auckland General Manager - Safety and Assurance replied  in 
part: 
[Transdev Auckland] accepts that there are some gaps in the emergency training 
provided to crews, most notably major tagging events. As a result [Transdev 
Auckland] will develop some new Q -cards for on board crews and provide training on 
their use (as part of our refresher training).
