- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue or alertness issues affecting the pilots'' performance in the provided document. Therefore, this theme does not contribute to the accident.

    '
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Communication issues are highlighted, such as the first air traffic controller not recognizing the urgency of the situation with NZ5046 and responding with "Roger" instead of providing assistance (3.13). Additionally, the failure to pass on pilot reports (pireps) to other aircraft that could be affected is noted (3.16). These communication issues contributed to the severity of the incident.
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilots' training was effective in helping them recognize and recover from the upsets caused by the turbulence, as their behavior was similar to that experienced in earlier simulator training (3.12). This theme contributed positively to the incident outcome by mitigating the severity of the turbulence encounters.
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that maintenance procedures and compliance were factors in the incident.

    '
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Fire detection and suppression systems are not mentioned as contributing factors in the turbulence encounters described in the document.

    '
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document mentions that the responsibility for ensuring that crews had the latest weather information was shared by the operator and the pilot-in-command, and ATC where an ATC service was provided (3.5). However, there is no direct indication that non-compliance with regulations was a contributing factor, so this theme has a minor weighting.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: Situational awareness was compromised as the crews might not have been aware of SIGMETs 28 and 31, which directly affected their planned routes and levels (3.2). This lack of awareness could have contributed to the decision to fly into areas of severe turbulence.
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of equipment design and specifications being a factor in the incident.

    '
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The crews' lack of awareness of the SIGMETs and the decision to fly at a certain flight level despite the forecasted turbulence indicate issues with risk assessment and management (3.2, 3.6). This theme significantly contributed to the incident as better risk management could have prompted a revision of the flight plans.
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document suggests that the first controller's response to the emergency situation was inadequate (3.13), indicating a need for better emergency response planning and coordination. However, since the pilots were able to manage the situation, this theme has a minor weighting.
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence in the document to suggest that distracted operation was a factor in the incident.

    '
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Structural integrity and material fatigue are not mentioned as contributing factors in the turbulence encounters.

    '
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: Human error is implied in the failure to communicate and manage the weather information effectively (3.2, 3.4, 3.15). Error management systems, such as the dissemination of SIGMETs and pireps, did not function optimally, contributing to the incident.
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Organizational issues such as limitations in the operator's dispatch system (3.4) and the decision by the first controller not to pass on the pirep from NZ5046 (3.15) suggest that organizational influences and safety culture played a role in the incident.
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The crews' potential lack of awareness of critical SIGMETs (3.2) and the need for clearer SIGMETs (3.19, 3.20) indicate that weather information dissemination and interpretation were significant factors in the incident.
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that are not already covered by the predefined themes.
