The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been undertaken 
for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing any 
recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the regulator 
and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission and this report  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and  co-
ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the cir cumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  or 
to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a pers on or agency.  
The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both domestically 
and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 30 December 2009, an Aerospatiale -Alenia ATR 72 -212A  (ATR 72) aeroplane flying between 
Christchurch and Wellington encountered severe turbulence when about 50 n m north of 
Christchurch.  Approximately 35 minutes later, another ATR 72 aeroplane, also flying from 
Christchurch to Wellington, encountered severe turbulence in the same general area.  
1.2. Although no injuries or damage result ed from  these incidents, the Transp ort Accident 
Investigation Commission (the Commission) decided to inquire into the adequacy of the 
meteorological information available to the pilots before and during the flights, the operator and 
flight crew action taken to minimise the risk s of severe t urbulence encounter s, and the 
processes followed by the providers of air traffic and meteorological services in response to 
pilot reports of significant weather hazards.  
1.3. The investigation found that the events might have been avoided or been less severe ha d the 
operator had a more robust flight dispatch system, and had the air traffic service complied fully 
with a requirement to pass flight information to pilots on first contact.  The Commission made a 
safety recommendation regarding the clarity of informat ion about  hazardous meteorological 
conditions.

 Report 10 -001 2. Factual Information  
2.1. History of the flight s 
First event, f light NZ5046  
 
2.1.1.  At 1301 on 30 December 2009, an ATR 72 aeroplane registered ZK -MCP departed 
Christchurch Aerodrome as scheduled flight NZ5046 to Wellington .  On board were 2 pilots , 2 
flight attendants  and 65 passengers .  The flight was conducted under instrument flight rules  
along the standard route that followed  the east coast of the South Island . 
2.1.2.  The crew had requested and been  cleared by air traffic control (ATC)  to cruise at flight level 
1702, above  an area of forecast severe turbulence .3  The captain had anticipated turbulence for 
much of the flight, so he had i nstructed th at passengers and flight attendants were to remain 
seated with their seat belts  on.  The aeroplane was in cloud  for most of the climb, and t he pilots 
had activated icing protection and were using the aeroplane  radar to avoid areas of heavy rain . 
2.1.3.  At 131 4, when about 50 n m north of Christchurch, the aeroplane encountered  severe 
turbulence  at about flight level 150 .  Recorde d aeroplane data showed the airspeed decrease d 
quick ly from about 170  knots (kt) to 14 4 kt, which was below the minimum speed for flight in 
icing conditions with flap retracted.  The angle of  attack increase d rapidly, which activat ed 
momentarily the stick -shaker  and caus ed the autopilot to disengage .  The instantaneous rate  of 
descent briefly exceeded 5500 feet per minute.   Loose objects on the flight deck were thrown 
about, and periods of negative G momentarily activated the engine low -oil- pressure warnings.  
2.1.4.  The wind vector displayed on the flight instruments changed from a 55 kt westerly to a 140 kt 
southerly in less tha n a minute.  However, t he data recorder showed that during the worst 30 
seconds of the event , the wind direction swung through 45  degrees  and the wind speed varied 
erratically between  80 and 27 kt before steadily returning towards the earlier value . 
2.1.5.  Shortl y after the stick -shake r activation , the non-flying pilot lowered the flaps to 15  degrees  to 
provide a greater margin above the stall speed in the prevailing icing conditions .  However,  the 
flap select ion coincided with a large pitch down of the aeroplane that caused the airspeed to 
increase  rapidly  to 205 kt, exceeding the limit speed  for the flap setting . 
2.1.6.  The non -flying pilot broadcast an urgency call , prefaced with the appropriate ‘PAN  PAN’, and 
said they were in severe turbulence an d unable to maintain altitude.  The controller , who said 
he did not hear the transmission  clearly , replied, ‘Mount Cook 46, say again your request’.   The 
pilot repeated th e information , but without the PAN prefix this time,  and said they would have to 
manoeuvre ‘ as required ’.  The controller replied ‘R oger’ only. 
2.1.7.  As the turbulence eased, the pilots continued the climb, although there was a brief, marked 
reduction in climb performance, possibly due to mountain waves in the lee of the coastal 
ranges.  The pilots then advised  that the aeroplane was under control  and they were continu ing 
to Wellington.  Th e controller acknowledged with ‘ Roger’.  The pilots offered  more information 
on the conditions and that  they had been unable to  maintain altitude , to which the controller 
again replied ‘Roger’. 
2.1.8.  No-one was injured  during the turbulence , the worst of which lasted  for a little over one minute . 
2.1.9.  The controller later said there had been a number of pilot reports (pireps) that day of severe 
turbulenc e across the South Island  and many aircraft had been unable to maintain their 
assigned altitude s or track s.  Th ose pireps  had been  passed to MetService  by the relevant 
controllers using direct telephone lines at their stations.  He said he had earlier pass ed to 
MetService a report of modera te-to-severe turbulence at flight level 220 that had been sent by  
an ATR 72 south -bound to Christchurch, and he had thought it unnecessary to pass on the 
report from NZ5046 . 
                                                      
2 Flight levels are heights in hundreds of feet above a reference datum.  Flight level 160 is 16 000 f eet above the 
datum . 
3 The perceived severity of turbulence is a function of aircraft type  and its mass, altitude, configuration and airspeed.  
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) classification is given in Appendix A.  
  
Report 10 -001 
<< Page 3 >>
 2.1.10.  At 1319, NZ5046 requested a higher flight  level, which was approved by a  different controller 
who had taken over the position in a routine changeover.   The replacement  controller 
subsequently cleared NZ5046 to de viate east of track as required . 
2.1.11.  At 1329, the replacement  controller  broa dcast  revised  SIGMET reports , including  SIGMET 4, 
which  amended an earlier warn ing of severe turbulence between flight levels 160 and 240, 
south east of a line from Kaikoura to Mount Cook .  That region  included the point  where NZ5046 
had struck  turbulence , but the SIGMET was based on a pirep made 2 hours earlier at a point 84 
nm southwest of Christchurch . 
2.1.12.  At 13 40, MetService logged the NZ5046 e ncounter .  The time of the event was not recorded, 
and the altitude was erroneously given as flight level 170, the a eroplane’s initial  cruise level . 
2.1.13.  At Wellington, the captain reported t hat severe  turbulence had been encountered and the flap  
limit speed exceeded.  The data recorder showed that the vertical acceleration  range had been 
from +2.12 G to –0.59  G.  The required maintenance inspections found no damage or defects . 
Second event, flight NZ5034  
 
2.1.14.  On the same day a t 1334 , another ATR 72, registered ZK -MCJ, departed Christchurch 
Aerodrome as scheduled flight NZ5034, also bound for Wellington  along the same route and at 
flight level 170 .  On board wer e 2 pilots , 2 flight attendants  and 66 passengers.   The pilots  had 
been told by the operator’s flight dispatcher of the earlier flight’s encounter  with turbulence, so 
the flight attendants were inst ructed to remain seated for the flight.  The aeroplane weather 
radar was in use.  The same (replacement) controller  advised NZ5034 that an unidentified 
preceding aircraft (almost certainly NZ5046) had encountered severe turbulence  and that 
altitude or track deviations were available if needed . 
2.1.15.  NZ5034 had already deviated east of the planned  route  when the pilots  requested more direct 
tracking towards Wellington , which  would have taken the flight further east.  However, a  Boeing 
737 descending o n the Wellington -to-Christchurch  route  prevented ATC from approving the 
request immediately.  NZ5034 then requested to climb from flight level 170 to flight level 190 
to get above moderate turbulence.  
2.1.16.  At 1350, ATC approved the higher level and in the same transmission gave NZ 5034  its arrival 
clearance for Wellington .  The crew’s read -back of the clearance was interrupted when they 
encountered severe turbulence  while in cloud , about 51 n m north of Christchurch . 
2.1.17.  The aeroplane’s data recorder showed that, coincident with a wind shift through 55  degrees  
and 34 kt  over 20 seconds, the aeroplane pitched  up then sharply down, giving a vertical 
acceleration change of 2.5  G in less than 1.5 seconds.  The stick -shaker activated momentarily 
and the engine low -oil pressure warning for one of the engines also illuminated briefly.  
2.1.18.  A minute later, ATC asked NZ5034 to read back the arrival clearance, and was told ‘Standby’.  
ATC then asked the Boeing 737 to report its flight conditions and was told that there was 
‘moderate -to-severe turbulence at times’.  T he controller then advised controllers of the 
adjacent ATC sectors that he was applying increased vertical separation between flights.   The 
crew of NZ5034 did not broadcast an urgency message advising of the severe turbulence.  
2.1.19.  After landing at Wellington, th e captain reported the severe turbulence event, which he also 
described as extreme and the worst he had experienced in 40 years of flying.  The data recorder 
showed that the vertical acceleration range had been from +1.84 G to –0.73 G.  The required 
mainte nance inspections found no damage or defects.  
2.1.20.  No-one was injured on NZ5034, although one of the flight attendants later reported minor neck 
discomfort that might have been related to the event.  
2.2. Personnel information  
2.2.1.  Both pilots of NZ5046 had captain  rank , but NZ5034 had a normal crew composition of captain 
and first officer.  All had extensive airline experience in New Zealand an d in flying ATR 72s. 
 

<< Page 4 >>
 Report 10 -001 2.2.2.  The ATC controller s were employed by Airways.  The controller of  NZ5046 when the aeroplane 
struck the severe turbulence had been  issued with a New Zealand air traffic controller licence 
on 8 April 2009 , but he had had 10 years ’ prior experience as a controller  overseas .  He held 
the appropriate controller ratings and a valid medical certificate.  His previous ann ual 
proficiency assessment had been  completed on 19 October 2009.  On 30 December 2009 h e 
commenced duty at 0830  and was scheduled to finish at 1600 .  He had worked from 1330 
until 2030  the previous day , with 2 da ys off duty before  that. 
2.3. Aircraft informati on 
2.3.1.  The ATR  72 was a high -wing aeroplane powered by 2 turboprop engines  and various versions 
had been in service with the operator since 1994.   The operator’s configuration seat ed 66 
passengers, in addition to the 2 pilots a nd 2 flight attendants.  
2.3.2.  The aerop lane load factor limits were +2.5 G to -1.0 G with the flaps retracted, and +2 G to 0 G 
with any flap extended.  
2.3.3.  The operator’s standard procedure was to ‘bug’ the minimum enroute airspeed for the flaps -up 
configuration in icing conditions.  Th e bug g ave pilots an immediate visual cue for th e minimum 
speed , which varied directly with the aeroplane weight . 
2.3.4.  The ATR 72 was fitted with  a Honeywell Primus® 660 weather radar , which, l ike other modern 
weather radars, was designed primarily to detect water droplet s rather than turbulence.  T he 
display was colour-coded according to the rain intensity.  The handbook noted there was a 
‘100% probability of light turbulence occurring in any area of light rain’ and that the probability 
of any severity of turbulence incre ased as the rain intensity increased (Honeywell , 1999).  
2.4. Meteorological information  
2.4.1.  According to Civil Aviation Rules  (Rules) , the pilot -in-command was responsible for obtaining 
and becoming familiar with the current meteorological information relevant to t he proposed 
flight, and the operator was responsible for ensuring that the appropriate information (which 
would include known potentially hazardous meteorological conditions) was made available to 
the pilot -in-command to prepare for that flight.4  The oper ator was required to use 
meteorological information that had been provided for aviation purposes by an  aviation 
meteorological service organisation certificated under Rules Part 174.5 
2.4.2.  The primary meteorological service organi sation in New Zealand was MetService , which was  
certificated by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide forecasts, disseminate meteorological 
information, provide briefings and routine reports, and  provide  a meteorological watch service  
‘over meteorological conditions affecting ai rcraft operations ’ (Airways, 2010 a, p.GEN 3.5 -2, 
effective 19 November 2009) . 
2.4.3.  An analysis provided by MetService showed that at midday o n 30 December 2009, an 
anticyclone wa s centred east of Tasmania and a deep trough of low pressure lay east of New 
Zealan d.  At sea level, a s trong southwest air flow covered the South Island and a cold front was 
situated north of Christchurch.  The trough was present through a deep layer, which included 
the planned cruise levels of these flights, with the maximum wind speed s present over a broad 
swath from Fiordland to Canterbury.  
2.4.4.  The operator had a contract with MetService for the provision of web -based flight briefings that 
were updated 3 times an hour.  The briefing accessed by the pilots of the first flight had been 
issued at 1136 and wa rned of  occasional moderate turbulence below flight level 160 south of a 
line from Nelson to Woodbourne (Blenheim) , and severe turbul ence as follows:  
SIGMET 24, issued 0844,  valid between 0844 and 1244, severe turbulence 
forecast below  flight level 140 about the ranges south of Nelson  to Woodbourne.  
Intensity no  change.  
                                                      
4 Rules 91.217, Pre-flight action , and 121.59, Flight preparation.  
5 Rule 121.153, Meteorological information . 
  
Report 10 -001 
<< Page 5 >>
 2.4.5.  The briefing also warned of occasional moderate turbulence at the relevant time between flight 
levels 160 and 260 south of a li ne from Westport to Kaikoura , and noted t hat a SIGMET for 
severe turbulence was possible.  Isolated embedded cumulonimbus (‘thunderstorm’) clouds 
were forecast adjacent to the planned routes of the  flight.  No significant icing was forecast.  
2.4.6.  At 1144, as a result of a pirep made at 1130 by an aeroplane then 84 n m southwest of 
Christchurch , the anticipated S IGMET was issued .  This read, in part:  
SIGMET 28, valid between  1144 and 1544, New Zealand Flight Information 
Region,  forecast severe turbulence  betw een flight levels 160 and 240 southeast  
[of a line from] Kaikoura to Mount Cook. Moving northeast at 30 kt. Intensity no 
change.  
2.4.7.  The area descr ibed in SIGMET 28 included the locations of the 2 ATR incidents.  
2.4.8.  MetService issued a revised flight briefing to t he operator at 1201 .  The included route forecast 
was essentially  the same as th at in th e 1136  briefing , but SIGMET  24 was replaced by SIGMET 
27, which raised  the top of the lower band of severe turbulence to flight level 1 60. 
2.4.9.  At 1205 , SIGMET 31 was issued, extend ing the region of forecast lower -atmosphere severe 
turbulence to the North Island.  SIGMET 31 read, in part:  
SIGMET 31, valid between 1205 and 1605, forecast sev ere turbulence below 
flight level 160 about the ranges north  of Nelson -Woodbo urne , south of Taupo .  
Intensity no change.  
2.4.10.  Ten minutes prior to the estimated departure time of a flight, one of the operator’s dispatchers 
would send  the latest  weather package and related flight information  to a personal digital 
assistant -type device in the aeroplane.   This procedure  could provide crew s with relevant flight 
information received since the y had prepared for their  flight s.  The device s were used  by crew s 
to access the information only when the aeroplane s were parked.  
2.4.11.  Whether the pilots of either flight had read SIGMET 28 and 31 was not determined.  The pilots 
did not recall precisely which SIGMETs they had read, and the time that web-based weather  
briefings were accessed, and by whom, was not recorded  by the operator .  The operator could 
not confirm that the latest weather packages had been sent prior to departure to the devices on 
NZ5046 and NZ5034, and did not ordinarily require crews to retain printed briefing papers.  
2.4.12.  The operator later advised that it was exploring ways to improve the content and delivery of 
flight information to crews before departure.  
2.4.13.  At 1327, which was after  NZ5046 had already encountered turbulence  and when NZ5034 was 
about to depart, MetService re -issued SIGMET 28  as SIGMET 46 and issued SIGMET 5, which in 
effect combined SIGMET s 27 and 31.  SIGMET 5 read, in part:  
SIGMET 5, valid between 1327 and 1727, New Zealand Flight Information 
Region, forecast severe turbulence below flight level 160 about the ranges south 
of Taupo. Intensity  no change.  
2.4.14.  The forecast wind for the route was south -west erly, increasing from 70 kt to 90 kt bet ween flight 
levels 150 and 190.   The wind recorded on the aeroplane data recorders  was, for the first flight, 
similar to that forecast,  but was generally at a lower speed for the second flight.  
2.4.15.  If SIGMET s were to be adequate, accurate and timely, MetService needed real-time information 
such as pireps .  The Aeronautical Information Publication New Zealand ( AIP) required pilots to 
make pirep s immediately when : 
hazardous meteorological conditions are encountered or observed which, in the 
opinion of the pilot are, or may become severe enough to warrant a SIGMET, 
regardless of any reports from other aircraft and regardless of any SIGMET 
issued ( Airways, 2010a, p.GEN 3.5 -25, effective 5 June 2008).  
                                                      
6 SIGMET s were sequentially numbered from the start of the UTC day.  
 

<< Page 6 >>
 Report 10 -001 2.4.16.  Airways was certificated to disseminate meteorological information and to supply routine 
meteorological reports.  The AIP listed SIGMET s, but not pireps,  among the information that ATC 
would adv ise to affected aircraft wit hin their area s of responsibility  (Airways, 2010a, p.GEN 3.5) , 
but Airways ’ did require controllers to pass pireps to  (Airways, 2010b, p.MET 2) : 
 other aircraft likely to be affected  
 other [air traffic service]  units whose area of responsibility is adjacent to 
the reported conditions, and  
 MetService.  
2.4.17.  The ICAO standard for ATC to forward pireps to the meteorological watch office was ‘without 
delay’ (IC AO, 2007 b, para graph 5.8).  Airways  expected controller s to forward pireps to 
MetService ‘as soon as practicable ’, but Airways later inform ed the Commission that its 
standard would be aligned with that of ICAO . 
2.4.18.  On 30 December 2009, MetService logged the receipt of  14 pireps, including 9 for severe 
turbulence .  Of those, 5 were made between 1215 and 1445 and related to encounters west 
and north of Christchurch .  All but one of tho se reports were passed to MetService by ATC  staff.  
The p irep made by NZ5046 at 1314 was not logged by M etService  until 1340. 
2.4.19.  MetService  said that the preparation of SIGMET s was the highest priority of the aviation 
forecasting desk .  Therefore, the receipt of information that suggested the criteria for the issue 
of a SIGMET had been met was also given t op priority.  If a pirep w ere consist ent with a current 
SIGMET, the report w ould be  considered to validate the SIGMET and no further action w ould be  
taken.  If there w ere no relevant SIGMET or the pirep indicated  that a SIGMET required 
amendment, a new issue or amendment w ould be  completed as soon as practicable.   The 
sequence of SIGMET s issued and pireps received by MetService on 30 December 20 09 is 
shown in Appendix  B. 
2.4.20.  The MetService criteria for the amendment of a forecast of turbulence (or icing) were: 
Newly expected occurrence; error in expected position of phenomena; intensity 
increasing; intensity decreasing from severe to light or nil, or from moderate to nil 
(Airways, 2010a, p.GEN 3.5 -44, effective 9 April 2009).  
2.5. Air traffic services  
2.5.1.  Air traffic services included ATC, flight informati on services and an alerting service.  The 
separation and control of aircraft w ere the first priority for controllers, but they were also tasked 
with providi ng flight information service s.  Any relevant information that could affect the safe 
and efficient c onduct of flights was to be passed ‘as soon as practicable’ to flights  known to be 
affected by the information .  That information included SIGMET s and ‘significant information 
received from other flights’ (Airways, 20 10b, p.RAC 10 -1, effective 12 April 2007) . 
2.5.2.  An air traffic service provider was required by the Rules to have procedures that ensured that 
available and relevant flight information, such as SIGMET s, was provided to aircraft that were 
provided with an ATC service.7 
2.5.3.  The AIP (Airways, 20 10a) stated, in part  (p.GEN 3.3 -7, effective 30 July 2009) : 
On first contact with [air traffic services] , the pilot of an IFR aircraft commencing 
a flight for which a flight plan has been filed will be provided with flight 
information  … received within the 90 minu tes preceding the activation of the 
plan.  
2.5.4.  A flight plan was activated when an aircraft took off.  In practice, the time between a crew 
briefing for a flight and their making first contact with ATC, usually to request permission from 
aerodrome control to start engines or to taxi for take -off, was less than an hour.  Airways 
advised that meteorological and other flight information was retained for 90 minutes after being 
received and the information  was not necessarily offered to all aircr aft when they first c ontact ed 
ATC.  The Commission was un able to determine whether the involved ATR crews had been  
                                                      
7 Rule 172.93, Flight information service . 
  
Report 10 -001 
<< Page 7 >>
 offered the latest SIGMET  by ATC b efore start -up, but other updates were broadcast by ATC on 
the area control frequency, as noted in paragraph 2.1.11.  
2.5.5.  Airways later informed  the Commission that it was reviewing its procedures to ensure the  
90-minute requirement was met.  
2.5.6.  The ATC radars in New Zealand did not display weather and radar controller s relied on 
MetService information and pireps to form picture s of the location s of adverse w eather.  
2.5.7.  An alerting service was provided by Airways to initiate and/or assist in search and rescue action 
for any flight known or thought to require assistance.  The 3 alerting  service phases we re 
(Airways, 2010b, p.RAC  7-4, effective 17 March 2005):  
Uncertainty : when uncertainty exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its 
occupants  
Alert : when apprehension exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants, 
and 
Distress : when there is a reasonable certainty that an aircraft and its occupants 
are threatened by grave and imminent danger and require immediate assistance.  
2.5.8.  Airways ’ procedures (Airways, 2010b) required that ‘except when no doubt exists for the safety 
of an aircraft and its occupants, an uncertainty phase s hall be declared when … [it is] 
experiencing hazardous meteorological conditions’, and that ‘an alert phase shall be declared 
when … [it] is known or believed to be experiencing impaired operating efficiency to the extent 
that it is having difficulty in ma intaining height’ (p.RAC 7 -6, effective 17 March 2005).  
2.5.9.  The AIP (Airways, 2010a) defined urgency  as ‘a condition concerning the safety of an aircraft, or 
of some person on board or within sight, but which does not require immediate assistance.   The 
pilot o f an aircraft reporting an urgency condition must transmit on the air -ground frequency in 
use at the time the urgency signal PAN PAN , preferably spoken three times, followed by the 
urgency message ’ (p.ENR 1.15 -2, effective 25 November 2004) . 
2.5.10.  All communicat ions between the incident flights and ATC were conducted on very  
high-frequency radio that was unaffected by the weather conditions at the time.  Airways staff 
considered that the traffic density during these occurrences was light.  
2.6. Additional information  
2.6.1.  The operator had no direct guidance in its manuals on the planning or conduct of flights in 
areas where moderate or severe turbulence was observed or forecast.  Final selection of a route 
and altitude, and the precautions taken enroute, were the prerogativ e of the pilot -in-command.   
Most  airlines recommend ed avoid ing flight through known or forecast severe turbulence , and 
larger airline s with specialist flight planning section s might pre -select route s to avoid forecast 
turbulence (and the potential unplanned diversions) because fuel and load planning were  
critical.  
2.6.2.  The reports on the CAA’s audits of the operator’s Enroute Operations and Management and 
General Operations from 2005 until 2010 were reviewed .  No findings or observations releva nt 
to these events were found.  
2.6.3.  A review of the CAA occurrence database found that about 50 notifications of turbulence, other 
than wake turbulence, were made between November 2005 and November 2010.  Half of the 
reports described the encounter as severe, b ut only 2 reports said a PAN call had been made 
and only one report referred to a SIGMET.  The text of the notifications generally did not provide 
sufficient information to assess the role of forecasts and flight planning in the occurrences.  
2.6.4.  The operator’s  recurrent training programme for 2010 specified that e ach pilot would be trained  
in stall identification and recovery in icing and non -icing conditions, and in the identification of 
and recovery from unusual attitudes in icing conditions  during their 6 -monthly simulator check 
(Mount Cook, 2009) .  Each pilot performed 2 or 3 recoveries in these sessions . 
2.6.5.  Some of the involved pilots said that the unusual attitudes in the simulator scenarios were 
surprisingly similar to those experienced during the  severe tur bulence .

 Report 10 -001 3. Analysis  
3.1. Two ATR 72 aeroplanes from the same operator encountered t urbulence 35 minutes apart, in 
about the same  location but at al titude s separated by 2000 f eet.  The flight loads recorded on 
the flight data recorders and the difficulty  that the pilots had  briefly in controlling the aeroplane s 
indicated that the turbulence was severe.   The focus of this inquiry was on the effectiveness of 
the system for the reporting and updating of severe weather information that could affect 
aircraft operations . 
3.2. The operator had made current  weather information available to both crews to enable them to 
plan their flights .  However, which weather briefings were used could not be confirmed , and it 
was possible that neither crew was aware of SIGMET s 28 and  31, which direct ly affected  the 
planned route s and level s of their flights.  Both crews  had expected moderate turbulence to be 
present along the route , and had therefore  chosen to cruise at flight level  170, above the 
turbulent level forecast in SIGMET 24 .  That SIGMET was to expire  before NZ5046 departed 
Christchurch , but the weather situation and the term ‘intensity no change’ would have alerted 
the pilots  to the likelihood that the SIGMET would be  re-issued.  
3.3. There were 3 ways in which a flight crew coul d receive SIGMETs before departure.  The first was 
from the operator’s flight briefing package (usually accessed less than a n hour before 
departure); the second was from the personal digital assistant device on the aeroplane 10 
minutes before departure (pr ovided the dispatcher had sent the information); and the third was 
by the first air traffic controller offering them information that had been received by ATC in the 
preceding 90 minutes.  
3.4. Limitations in the operator’s dispatch system for updating flight information m ight have been a 
cause of the c rews not receiving updated weather  information , including SIGMET 28 , after they 
had completed briefing .  Although the information  was automatically collated , a flight dispatcher 
had to send it  manually .  However,  the crew of NZ5034 did know  that the preceding  NZ5046 
had encountered severe turbulence . 
3.5. The Rules indicated that the responsibility for ensuring that crews had the latest weather 
informa tion was shared by the operator and  the pilot -in-command , and ATC where an ATC 
service was provided.  The Airways procedure for providing this information when a pilot made 
first contact was a useful defence against ‘last minute’ changes that might affect a flight, and 
therefore the procedure warranted strict co mpliance.  
3.6. Had the crew s been a ware of SIGMET 28, even as late as when they were about to taxi for 
departure, they might have been prompted to revise their flight plan s and might have avoided or 
reduced the severity of the turbulence  encounters . 
3.7. The intende d actions of the operator and Airways to improve their respective systems for 
passing information to flight crews  should ensure that  in future crews receive the most current 
flight information, including weather warnings, before departure.  
3.8. The complete  avoidance of flight into an area of forecast severe turbulence was not always 
practical , because the forecast strength and location of the hazard  were sometimes inaccurate .  
Hence, pireps were essential to allow MetService and similar agencies to advise of ob served 
areas of turbulence and to improve their forecasts.  
3.9. Experience, such as that which the involved pilots had gained from years of flying over the 
South Island, gave pilots an appropriate level of respect for weather hazards and guided them 
in route an d flight level selection to minimise their risk s.  For the flights involved, an additional 
route was available further east of the coast, but it was not requested by either crew.  At the 
time the y were flight planning, the eastern route might have looked less likely  to be affected by  
turbulence , although  pireps from south -bound aeroplanes showed it had been similarly 
affected.  
3.10.  The report of loose objects on one flight deck suggested pilots should take more care to secure 
items under their control, just as they expect the cabin and its occupants to be secured.  
  
Report 10 -001 
<< Page 9 >>
 3.11.  The use of minimum speed bugs on the airspeed indicator was effective in provid ing the pilots 
with an immediate cue to the degraded performance and, in the case of NZ5046, to the need to 
extend flap pr omptly.  In spite of the subsequent unavoidable exceedance of the flap limit 
speed, extending the flap likely prevented a more extreme upset.  
3.12.  The suggestions by some of the pilots that the aeroplane s’ behaviour during the turbulence w as 
very similar to that experienced in earlier simulator training proved the value of such training .  
The pilots’ prior experience likely assisted the m to r ecognis e and promptly recover from the 
upsets  without incurring injury or damage.  
3.13.  The first controller did not hear the PA N call from NZ5046 , and as PAN was not used when the 
crew repeated their message, he did not recognise that their  situation was one of urgency.  The 
crew advised  that they were unable to maintain altitude, but the controller did not clear the 
flight to dev iate from altitude as required, which would have been the expected response , 
especially as he had been aware that other aeroplanes had had a similar need during his shift .  
Rather than show  he understood the situation , the controller acknowledged  the calls from 
NZ5046 with ‘Roger’, a term that only means ‘ I have received all of your last transmission ’. 
3.14.  The passive controlling  contrasted  with th at of the replacement controller  who offered NZ5034 
some flexibility of route and altitude, and later advised controllers of adjacent sectors that he 
was increas ing the minimum vertical separation between aeroplanes that could be subjected to 
altitude excursions.  
3.15.  Airways required all pireps to be passed to MetService, but the first controller said he decided 
not t o pass on the pirep from NZ5046  because he had earlier passed on one from an ATR .  The 
pirep from NZ5046 was also received  at a time when the controller was likely briefing the 
incoming controller.  The decision to not pass it on did not appear to have affected the 
timeliness or accuracy of later SIGMET s. 
3.16.  Airways also required controllers to pass pireps  to other aircraft that could be affected , 
presumably because one  could not rely on potentially affected pilots overhearing the initial 
transmission s of pirep s.  However, pireps were not in the AIP list of  information that ATC would 
pass to aircraft.  I f the AIP page GEN 3.5 w ere amended to i nclud e pireps in the list of in-flight 
services, pilots might better appreciate the mutual benefit of making reports whenever a severe 
meteorological phenomenon was encountered.  
3.17.  Comparison of the MetService pirep log with the issue d SIGMET s showed th at MetService had 
conformed to its  stated criteria for  the issue and timelines s of SIGMET s. 
3.18.  The meteorological situation generated turbulence over a wide area of the country, a nd pireps 
confirmed the general accuracy of the forecasts .  MetService used the pireps to refine the 
series of SIG METs issued for limited regions and altitude bands, until a point was reached in the 
early afternoon where  some regions could be combined  and the number of SIGMET s reduced.  
Hence, SIGMETs 27 and 31 were combined into SIGMET 5.  
3.19.  It was important that pilots  and flight dispatchers interpreted SIGMET s correctly, because the 
abbreviated text, although standardised, could be misleading .  For example, in SIGMET 5 it was 
clear that ‘south of Taupo  aerodrome ’ included the southern half of the North Island, 
particul arly with the attached reference to observed severe turbulence near Napier .  However, 
the SIGMET applied to all of the New Zealand Flight Information Region  and therefore included 
all of the South Island .  The correct interpretation was not obvious unless one analys ed the 
sequence of issues and amendments.  
3.20.  Greater use of plain language, within the constraints of international conventions, would assist 
in making SIGMET s easier to read .  The Commission made a recommendation to the Director of 
Civil Aviation t hat he address the safety issue whereby SIGMET s can be misleading or lack 
clarity because of insufficient reference to  recognisable geographic regions .

 Report 10 -001 4. Findings  
 Findings are listed in order of development and not in order of priority.  
 
4.1. An accurate pre-flight  weather briefing package was  provided by MetService and the pilots of 
both flights made appropriate initial selections of route and flight level  based on th e briefing s 
that th ey likely used .  However, whether the pilots were  aware of the later issue of SIGMET 28, 
which  directly af fected the ir plann ed flight s, was not known . 
4.2. Had the pilots been aware of  SIGMET 28 before departing , the y might have revise d their flight 
plans an d the turbulence encounters might have been avoided,  or less sever e. 
4.3. The severe turbulence encounters did not result in any injury because the pilots had anticipat ed 
moderate turbulence and had instructed their passengers and cabin crew to remain seated.  
4.4. The dislodging of items in the flight deck of one aer oplane was a reminder to pilots to prepare 
their flight deck s in the same way that they instruct ed the cabin  to be prepared  for turbulence.  
4.5. The value of the operator’s unusual -attitudes training was proven  by the pilots’ prompt 
recogniti on and recovery from the upsets, which also avoided aeroplane damage.  
4.6. Although the controller of Flight NZ5046 did not recognise that the flight was in a state of 
urgency, because he did not hear the pilot call ‘P AN’, the controller’s brief response to the 
subsequent info rmation that the crew was having difficulty maintaining altitude did little to 
assist them to manage the severe turbulence event . 
4.7. The severe turbulence encounters were reported by pilots, as required, to ATC without delay, 
and post -flight to the operator’s  maintenance staff.  
4.8. The delay in ATC passing the pirep from NZ5046 to MetService had no bearing on the 
subsequent encounter by NZ5034, but s uggested the procedure within ATC could be improved . 
4.9. MetService conformed to its stated criteria for the issue and t imeliness of SIGMET s. 
4.10.  The interpretation of SIGMET s could be improved by clearer  reference to recognisable  
geographic regions . 
  
  
Report 10 -001 
<< Page 11 >>
 5. Recommendations  
General  
5.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it cons iders the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety  issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, a recommendation  has been issued to the Director of Civil  Aviation . 
5.2. In the interests of transport safety , it is important that recommendation s are  implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendation  
5.3. On 31 August  2010 , the Commission made a preliminary recommend ation  that t he Director of 
Civil Aviation address the following safety issue:  
The interpretation of SIGMET s could be improved by the use of clearer reference 
to geographical regions, although the requirement to conform to ICAO Standards 
and Recomm ended Procedures is appreciated  (045/10) . 
 On 10 September 2010, the Director of Civil Aviation replied , in part : 
The Authority accepts in principle the proposed safety recommendation.
