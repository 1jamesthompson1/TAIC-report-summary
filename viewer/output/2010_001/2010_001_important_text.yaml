  \ the same operator encountered t urbulence 35 minutes apart, in \nabout the same\
  \  location but at al titude s separated by 2000 f eet.  The flight loads recorded\
  \ on \nthe flight data recorders and the difficulty  that the pilots had  briefly\
  \ in controlling the aeroplane s \nindicated that the turbulence was severe.   The\
  \ focus of this inquiry was on the effectiveness of \nthe system for the reporting\
  \ and updating of severe weather information that could affect \naircraft operations\
  \ . \n3.2. The operator had made current  weather information available to both\
  \ crews to enable them to \nplan their flights .  However, which weather briefings\
  \ were used could not be confirmed , and it \nwas possible that neither crew was\
  \ aware of SIGMET s 28 and  31, which direct ly affected  the \nplanned route s\
  \ and level s of their flights.  Both crews  had expected moderate turbulence to\
  \ be \npresent along the route , and had therefore  chosen to cruise at flight level\
  \  170, above the \nturbulent level forecast in SIGMET 24 .  That SIGMET was to\
  \ expire  before NZ5046 departed \nChristchurch , but the weather situation and\
  \ the term 'intensity no change' would have alerted \nthe pilots  to the likelihood\
  \ that the SIGMET would be  re-issued.  \n3.3. There were 3 ways in which a flight\
  \ crew coul d receive SIGMETs before departure.  The first was \nfrom the operator's\
  \ flight briefing package (usually accessed less than a n hour before \ndeparture);\
  \ the second was from the personal digital assistant device on the aeroplane 10\
  \ \nminutes before departure (pr ovided the dispatcher had sent the information);\
  \ and the third was \nby the first air traffic controller offering them information\
  \ that had been received by ATC in the \npreceding 90 minutes.  \n3.4. Limitations\
  \ in the operator's dispatch system for updating flight information m ight have\
  \ been a \ncause of the c rews not receiving updated weather  information , including\
  \ SIGMET 28 , after they \nhad completed briefing .  Although the information  was\
  \ automatically collated , a flight dispatcher \nhad to send it  manually .  However,\
  \  the crew of NZ5034 did know  that the preceding  NZ5046 \nhad encountered severe\
  \ turbulence . \n3.5. The Rules indicated that the responsibility for ensuring that\
  \ crews had the latest weather \ninforma tion was shared by the operator and  the\
  \ pilot -in-command , and ATC where an ATC \nservice was provided.  The Airways\
  \ procedure for providing this information when a pilot made \nfirst contact was\
  \ a useful defence against 'last minute' changes that might affect a flight, and\
  \ \ntherefore the procedure warranted strict co mpliance.  \n3.6. Had the crew s\
  \ been a ware of SIGMET 28, even as late as when they were about to taxi for \n\
  departure, they might have been prompted to revise their flight plan s and might\
  \ have avoided or \nreduced the severity of the turbulence  encounters . \n3.7.\
  \ The intende d actions of the operator and Airways to improve their respective\
  \ systems for \npassing information to flight crews  should ensure that  in future\
  \ crews receive the most current \nflight information, including weather warnings,\
  \ before departure.  \n3.8. The complete  avoidance of flight into an area of forecast\
  \ severe turbulence was not always \npractical , because the forecast strength and\
  \ location of the hazard  were sometimes inaccurate .  \nHence, pireps were essential\
  \ to allow MetService and similar agencies to advise of ob served \nareas of turbulence\
  \ and to improve their forecasts.  \n3.9. Experience, such as that which the involved\
  \ pilots had gained from years of flying over the \nSouth Island, gave pilots an\
  \ appropriate level of respect for weather hazards and guided them \nin route an\
  \ d flight level selection to minimise their risk s.  For the flights involved,\
  \ an additional \nroute was available further east of the coast, but it was not\
  \ requested by either crew.  At the \ntime the y were flight planning, the eastern\
  \ route might have looked less likely  to be affected by  \nturbulence , although\
  \  pireps from south -bound aeroplanes showed it had been similarly \naffected.\
  \  \n3.10.  The report of loose objects on one flight deck suggested pilots should\
  \ take more care to secure \nitems under their control, just as they expect the\
  \ cabin and its occupants to be secured.  \n  \nReport 10 -001 \n<< Page 9 >>\n\
  \ 3.11.  The use of minimum speed bugs on the airspeed indicator was effective in\
  \ provid ing the pilots \nwith an immediate cue to the degraded performance and,\
  \ in the case of NZ5046, to the need to \nextend flap pr omptly.  In spite of the\
  \ subsequent unavoidable exceedance of the flap limit \nspeed, extending the flap\
  \ likely prevented a more extreme upset.  \n3.12.  The suggestions by some of the\
  \ pilots that the aeroplane s' behaviour during the turbulence w as \nvery similar\
  \ to that experienced in earlier simulator training proved the value of such training\
  \ .  \nThe pilots' prior experience likely assisted the m to r ecognis e and promptly\
  \ recover from the \nupsets  without incurring injury or damage.  \n3.13.  The first\
  \ controller did not hear the PA N call from NZ5046 , and as PAN was not used when\
  \ the \ncrew repeated their message, he did not recognise that their  situation\
  \ was one of urgency.  The \ncrew advised  that they were unable to maintain altitude,\
  \ but the controller did not clear the \nflight to dev iate from altitude as required,\
  \ which would have been the expected response , \nespecially as he had been aware\
  \ that other aeroplanes had had a similar need during his shift .  \nRather than\
  \ show  he understood the situation , the controller acknowledged  the calls from\
  \ \nNZ5046 with 'Roger', a term that only means ' I have received all of your last\
  \ transmission '. \n3.14.  The passive controlling  contrasted  with th at of the\
  \ replacement controller  who offered NZ5034 \nsome flexibility of route and altitude,\
  \ and later advised controllers of adjacent sectors that he \nwas increas ing the\
  \ minimum vertical separation between aeroplanes that could be subjected to \naltitude\
  \ excursions.  \n3.15.  Airways required all pireps to be passed to MetService,\
  \ but the first controller said he decided \nnot t o pass on the pirep from NZ5046\
  \  because he had earlier passed on one from an ATR .  The \npirep from NZ5046 was\
  \ also received  at a time when the controller was likely briefing the \nincoming\
  \ controller.  The decision to not pass it on did not appear to have affected the\
  \ \ntimeliness or accuracy of later SIGMET s. \n3.16.  Airways also required controllers\
  \ to pass pireps  to other aircraft that could be affected , \npresumably because\
  \ one  could not rely on potentially affected pilots overhearing the initial \n\
  transmission s of pirep s.  However, pireps were not in the AIP list of  information\
  \ that ATC would \npass to aircraft.  I f the AIP page GEN 3.5 w ere amended to\
  \ i nclud e pireps in the list of in-flight \nservices, pilots might better appreciate\
  \ the mutual benefit of making reports whenever a severe \nmeteorological phenomenon\
  \ was encountered.  \n3.17.  Comparison of the MetService pirep log with the issue\
  \ d SIGMET s showed th at MetService had \nconformed to its  stated criteria for\
  \  the issue and timelines s of SIGMET s. \n3.18.  The meteorological situation\
  \ generated turbulence over a wide area of the country, a nd pireps \nconfirmed\
  \ the general accuracy of the forecasts .  MetService used the pireps to refine\
  \ the \nseries of SIG METs issued for limited regions and altitude bands, until\
  \ a point was reached in the \nearly afternoon where  some regions could be combined\
  \  and the number of SIGMET s reduced.  \nHence, SIGMETs 27 and 31 were combined\
  \ into SIGMET 5.  \n3.19.  It was important that pilots  and flight dispatchers\
  \ interpreted SIGMET s correctly, because the \nabbreviated text, although standardised,\
  \ could be misleading .  For example, in SIGMET 5 it was \nclear that 'south of\
  \ Taupo  aerodrome ' included the southern half of the North Island, \nparticul\
  \ arly with the attached reference to observed severe turbulence near Napier . \
  \ However, \nthe SIGMET applied to all of the New Zealand Flight Information Region\
  \  and therefore included \nall of the South Island .  The correct interpretation\
  \ was not obvious unless one analys ed the \nsequence of issues and amendments.\
  \  \n3.20.  Greater use of plain language, within the constraints of international\
  \ conventions, would assist \nin making SIGMET s easier to read .  The Commission\
  \ made a recommendation to the Director of \nCivil Aviation t hat he address the\
  \ safety issue whereby SIGMET s can be misleading or lack \nclarity because of insufficient\
  \ reference to  recognisable geographic regions . \n  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>"
