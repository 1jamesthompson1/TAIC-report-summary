  \ on what should have been a short , routine voyage between Nelson and \nTarakohe.\
  \  The vessel had been in Nelson for 2 days undergoing maintenance rather than \n\
  working cargo.  The crew therefore had a work routine that afforded them ample time\
  \ for rest \nand recreation.  The grounding was not a result of any technical or\
  \ mechanical failure.  \n4.1.2.  This analysis discusses how the grounding occurred\
  \ and discusses the effect that lack of \nsleep can have on human performance, and\
  \ the effect that alcohol consumption can h ave on \nthe quality of sleep.  These\
  \ 2 issues are considered to have been the main factors contributing \nto the grounding.\
  \  \n4.2. How the grounding occurred  \n4.2.1.  The standard of navigation on board\
  \ the Anatoki  leading up to the grounding was not in \naccordance with the p ractices\
  \  recommended in STCW .  The reasons for this are discussed \nbelow .  The coastline\
  \ that the Anatoki  was following was conducive to accurate coastal \nposition plotting.\
  \  The Anatoki  followed the passage plan up to the end of the 0400 watch . The\
  \ \nplotted positions were a mix of single radar range and bearing or GPS plots\
  \  (see Figure 4) .  \nFrom 0400 to the time of the grounding the standard of navigation\
  \ deteriorated.  \n4.2.2.  From about 0408 t he mate deviated from the passage plan,\
  \ but that was in keeping with the \nmaster's night orders.  The night orders said\
  \ \"if arriving earlier stay 5 miles off the coast\". \nAlthough achievable this\
  \ instruction was ambiguous and not very practicable .  The vessel's  \npassage\
  \ plan had the ship closer than 5 nautical miles to the coast fr om Separation P\
  \ oint to \nthe arrival waypoint , which was less than one mile off the port.  \
  \ In his submission on the draft \nreport , the master said he meant for  the ship\
  \ to arrive off Tarakohe , and from then on to stay \n5 miles off the coast.  This\
  \ too did not seem l ogical as it required the watch -keepers, who had \njust navigated\
  \ the ship from Nelson within 5 miles of the coast  for mu ch of the way , to then\
  \ \nturn away from the coast and negotiate the spat catching area before being able\
  \ to comply \n(see Figure 3)  \n4.2.3.  The course the vessel travelled missed the\
  \ spat catching area  permanently marked on the \nchart , but the area had been\
  \ enlarged as contained in the notice  to mariners NZ 235(T)/09 \nand the vessel\
  \ encroached on this area.  Fortunately the obstructions in the area  had been \n\
  removed a few days earlier  but the notice to mariners was still in force and was\
  \ not cancelled \nuntil 28 May 2010.   Although the master noted in his night orders\
  \ to watch for \"M. farm and \nM. barges \" the mate would not have been aware of\
  \ the extend ed precautionary area as this \nhad not been  marked on the chart \
  \ (see Figure 4) .   \n4.2.4.  The AIS data shows that the mate adjusted the vessel's\
  \ course at about 0408 to achieve a \ncourse over the ground of 253\xB0 , and the\
  \ vessel's track and speed did not change from t hen \nuntil the time it grounded.\
  \  The alteration of course wa s made without plotting the vessel's \nposition,\
  \ and no reliable position w as placed on the chart until the master came to the\
  \ bridge \nand plotted the position where the vessel lay aground.  \n4.2.5.  The\
  \ posit ion placed on the chart labelled 0430 did not correspond with the actual\
  \ position of \nthe ship as shown by the AIS plot.  There was no way of determining\
  \ what method the mate \nused to plot the 0430 position.  The possibility that it\
  \ had been placed on the ch art after the \nvessel grounded could not be ruled out.\
  \  \n4.2.6.  The mate was supposed to call the engineer at 0445, but he did not\
  \ do this until 0515, 30  \nminutes late and when the ship had already been aground\
  \ for about 8 minutes.  \n4.2.7.  The mate was adamant that he had n ot fallen asleep\
  \ after altering the vessel's course to \n253\xB0 , but the sequence of events described\
  \ above show this as a strong possibility.  If he had \nnot fallen asleep, he must\
  \ have been doing something other than monitoring the progress of \nthe vessel.\
  \   If a working bridge watch navigational and alarm system of some sort had been\
  \ \nfitted to the Anatoki , then he may have been alerted in time to prevent the\
  \ vessel  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Report 10 -202   \nincorrectly marked \"spat area\"\

  \   A recommendation has been made to the Director of Maritime New Zealand \nto\
  \ address this safety issue.  \nFinding:  \nThe Anatoki  ran aground because the\
  \ mate was not adequately monitoring the progress of \nthe ship against the passage\
  \ plan and the master's night orders, and in the period \nimmediately before the\
  \ grounding, could not have been monitoring the progress of the \nvessel at all.\
  \  \nFinding:  \nA working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have\
  \ been fitted to  the \nAnatoki  to mitigate the known risk of  one-man bridge operations.\
  \  Had one been fitted the \nmate might have been alerted in time to prevent the\
  \ grounding.  \n4.3. Self-imposed sleep deprivation  \n4.3.1.  The working schedule\
  \ for the Anatoki  in the 2 days before the grounding afforded the crew \nample\
  \ opportunity for rest and recreation.  \n4.3.2.  Both the master and the engineer\
  \ took their opportunities to sleep and had not consumed \nalcohol on the evening\
  \ of departure from Nelson.  Their performance was  therefore unlikely to \nhave\
  \ been impaired by lack of sleep.  \n4.3.3.  The watchkeeper had also taken his\
  \ opportunities to rest, but he said he had consume d 2 \npints of beer about 4.5\
  \ hours before going on duty.  Alcohol intake affects individuals in \ndifferent\
  \ ways de pending on physical characteristics and circumstance s.  It is unlikely\
  \ that the \nwatchkeeper's performance was impaired by alcohol at the time he went\
  \ on duty; however, it \nis questionable whether he was complying with the company\
  \ policy on alcohol at the ti me. \n4.3.4.  The mate, on the night of 4 May, had\
  \ taken the opportunity to spend the night at home with \nhis family.  On 5 May\
  \ he decided to accompany the watchkeeper ashore to a local \nbar/restaurant where\
  \ he consumed \"4 to 5 pints of beer\"  before returning to the v essel at \nabout\
  \ 2215, 45 minutes before he went on duty.  Even when considering that alcohol affects\
  \ \nindividuals in different ways, the mate's performance would likely have been\
  \ impaired when \nhe was steering the Anatoki  out of Ne lson under the master's\
  \ comm and, which meant that h e \nwould not have complied with the company drug\
  \ and alcohol policy at that time.  \n4.3.5.  It was not able to be established\
  \ whether the mate would have still been impaired by alcohol \nat the time he came\
  \ on watch shortly after 0400 on 5 May.  The company instigated post -\nincident\
  \ testing for alcohol and drugs, the results of which were negative for both drugs\
  \ and \nalcohol for the master and crew.  However, the post incident testing was\
  \ not carried out until \nabout 1 550 on the day of the grounding , more than  10.5\
  \ hours after the Anatoki  had run \naground and more than  18 hours since any of\
  \ the crew said they had last consumed alcohol.  \n4.3.6.  For post -incident screening\
  \ for alcohol and drugs in a person's body to be effective the \nscreening should\
  \ be carried o ut as soon as possible after the incident otherwise the body \neither\
  \ metabolises or ejects the substance as time passes.  After 18 hours it was unlikely\
  \ that \nany of the crew would have had any alcohol remaining in their bod ies.\
  \  \n4.3.7.  Research has shown that even  consuming a small amount of alcohol prior\
  \ to sleep can affect \nthe quality of sleep leading to daytime fatigue and sleepiness.\
  \  The National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes\
  \ of Health in the United States of \nAmerica stat ed in their publication Alcohol\
  \ Alert No. 41 in July 1998 that:  \nAlcohol and sleep in those without alcoholism\
  \  \nAlcohol consumed at bedtime, after an initial stimulating effect, may decrease\
  \ \nthe time required to fall asleep. Because of alcohol's sedating ef fect, many\
  \ \npeople with insomnia consume alcohol to promote sleep. However, alcohol \nconsumed\
  \ within an hour of bedtime appears to disrupt the second half of the \n \n\n<<\
  \ Page 14 >>\n Report 10 -202 sleep period (7). The subject may sleep fitfully during\
  \ the second half of sleep, \nawakening from  dreams and returning to sleep with\
  \ difficulty. With continued \nconsumption just before bedtime, alcohol's sleep\
  \ -inducing effect may decrease, \nwhile its disruptive effects continue or increase\
  \ (8). This sleep disruption may \nlead to daytime fatigue and sleep iness. \u2026\
  \  \nAlcoholic beverages are often consumed in the late afternoon (e.g., at \"happy\
  \ \nhour\" or with dinner) without further consumption before bedtime. Studies show\
  \ \nthat a moderate dose(1) of alcohol consumed as much as 6 hours before \nbedtime\
  \ can increase  wakefulness during the second half of sleep. By the time \nthis\
  \ effect occurs, the dose of alcohol consumed earlier has already been \neliminated\
  \ from the body, suggesting a relatively long -lasting change in the \nbody's mechanisms\
  \ of sleep regulation (7,8).  \nThe adverse effects of sleep deprivation are increased\
  \ following alcohol \nconsumption. Subjects administered low doses of alcohol following\
  \ a night of \nreduced sleep perform poorly in a driving simulator, even with no\
  \ alcohol left in \nthe body (9,10). Reduced alertness may potentially increase\
  \ alcohol's sedating \neffect in situations such as rotating sleep -wake schedules\
  \ (e.g., shift work) and \nrapid travel across multiple time zones (i.e., jet lag)\
  \ (9). A person may not \nrecognize the extent of sleep disturbance that occurs\
  \ under these circumstances, \nincreasing the danger that sleepiness and alcohol\
  \ consumption will co -occur2 \n(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\
  \ of the National Institutes of \nHealth, 2000) . \n4.3.8.  After the vessel had\
  \ left Nelson the mate left the wheelhouse to go to bed at about 0020.  He \nwas\
  \ called again at about 0350 which left him about 3 5 hours in which to sleep, having\
  \ been \nawake from about 0700 the day before.  \n4.3.9.  \"To be alert and to function\
  \ w ell, each person requires a specific amount of nightly sleep.  If \nindividual\
  \ \"sleep need\" is not met, the consequences are increased biological sleepiness,\
  \ \nreduced alertness, and impaired physical and mental performance.  For most people,\
  \ getting \n2 hours' less sleep than they need on one night (an acute sleep loss\
  \ of 2 hours) is enough to \ncause measurable impairment of performance and alertness\
  \ the next day.  The reduction in \nperformance capacity is particularly marked\
  \ if less than about 5 hours' sleep is o btained\"3 \n4.3.10.  The mate had only\
  \ had 3.5 hours ' sleep in the previous 21 hours by the time he went on \nwatch\
  \ at 0400.  It is possible that the quality of that 3.5 hours ' sleep was lowered\
  \ by the \neffects of alcohol that he had stopped consuming about 3 hours befo re\
  \ going to sleep.  Either \nway, the m ate's performance was likely to have been\
  \ impaired owing  to acute sleep loss.  \nFinding:  \nThe mate did not take enough\
  \ of the ample opportunity he had to rest before being required \nfor watchkeeping\
  \ duties.  \nFinding:  \nThe mate's performance was likely to have been adversely\
  \ affected by him only having a \nmaximum of 3.5 hours sleep in the preceding 21\
  \ hours and possibly the effects of alcohol \naffecting the quality of that sleep.\

  \  When Maritime NZ and the Anatoki 's owner started corresponding to determine\
  \ the Maritime \nRules that applied to  the Anatoki , it was apparent that the vessel\
  \ naturally fell somewhere \nbetween a SOLAS vessel and a coastal vessel less than\
  \ 45 m  tonnage length .  After the \nvessel's arrival in Nelson from Japan , the\
  \ owner had had the vessel modified to shorten the \ntonnage length of the vessel\
  \ to under 45 metres  thus allowing the vessel to enter the safe \nship management\
  \ system and be manned in accordance with Marit ime Rules Part 31B.   \n4.4.2. \
  \ The correlation between SOLAS, STCW and the New Zealand Maritime Rules is complex.\
  \  The \nAnatoki  fell somewhere between the requirements of each and this had caused\
  \ substantial \ndialogue between Maritime New Zealand and the owner, which was still\
  \ on -going and \nunresolved at the time this report was published.  The Commission\
  \ has recommended that the \nDirector of Maritime New Zealand resolves the issue\
  \ of the n umber and type of qualifications \napplicable to the vessel.   \n4.4.3.\
  \  Regardless of what qualification the national and international rules said the\
  \ mate should \nhave held , the main issue contributing to the grounding was the\
  \ standard of  navigation .  The \noffshore watchkeeper 's qualification that the\
  \ mate held should have been sufficient to enable \nhim to  navigate the Anatoki\
  \  from Nelson to Tarakohe.  That aside, the coastal navigation \nsyllabus for an\
  \ off -shore master is more extensive than that for a watch -keeper.  Wh ether the\
  \ \ngrounding would have happened  if the mate had held an offshore master certificate\
  \ is a \nmatter of conjecture.  Regardless of the qualifications held by the watchkeepers\
  \ , the \nnavigation standards on any vessel come under the auspices of the master,\
  \  and ultimately the \nowner  who are responsible for ensuring the standards of\
  \ navigation are up to industry best \npractice.  \n4.4.4.  The consumption of alcohol\
  \ by the watchkeeper and mate, and the master's tacit acceptance \nof their behaviour\
  \ in that regard , show ed that the owner 's drug and alcohol policy was not \n\
  being complied with . \n4.4.5.  When the grounding occurred t he safe ship management\
  \ system for the Anatoki  was in its \nexemption  period , where time was allowed\
  \ for the accumulation of records that showed the \noperator was measuring and monitoring\
  \ standards,  investigating accidents and incidents and \ntaking corrective actions\
  \ in the spirit of the concept of continuous improvement.  The Anatoki  \nhad yet\
  \ to undergo any form of safe ship management audit since the safe ship management\
  \ \ncertificate had been  issued in February 2010.  However, this was a new certificate\
  \ after the \nvessel's modification in F ebruary  and t he vessel had been within\
  \ a n safe s hip management \nsystem since commencing operations in New Zealand\
  \ in 2008.  There are 3 safety issues \nraised in this report that indicate that\
  \ more work is needed by the owner and its crews before \nthe safe ship management\
  \ system can be said to be working as  it should.  \n4.4.6.  At the time of the\
  \ accident t here were  no rules limiting the amount  of alcohol and other \nperformance\
  \ -impairing substances for commercial seafarers  and recreational boat drivers\
  \ in \ncharge of a vessel .  The Commission considers  that it is a serio us safety\
  \ issue because b eing \nin charge of a vessel is equal to, if not more demanding\
  \ than, driving a car on the road, and \nthe consequences can be the same . \n4.4.7.\
  \  On 8 March 2011 , in its report on a collision between a jet boat and a jetski,\
  \ (Transport \nAccident Investigation Commission, 2011)  the Commission made  a\
  \ recommendation to the \nSecretary of Transport regarding substance  impairment\
  \ in the maritime sector.   The \nrecommendation and the reply on behalf of the\
  \ Secretary of Transport  are shown  below:   \nUntil legislation is made setting\
  \ limits for and testing of alcohol and other performance \nimpairing substances\
  \ for recreational and commercial boat drivers , the risk of alcohol -\nrelated\
  \ accidents will be elevated.  \nIt is recommended that t he Secretary for Transport\
  \ address this safety issue by \npromot ing appropriate legislation to set maximum\
  \ allowable levels of alcohol and other \nperformance impairing substances  for\
  \ persons in charge of recreational and \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Report 10 -202 commercial\
  \ craft, an d supporting legislation to allow testing for such  levels in these\
  \ \ncases.   (005/11)  \nOn 16 March 2011, the Manager Maritime and Freight of the\
  \ Ministry of Transport  \nreplied to the final recommendation:  \nThe recommendation\
  \ is that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to set \nlimits and establish\
  \ a testing regime to address the risk of recreational and \ncommercial boating\
  \ accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance -\nimpairing substances.\
  \  \nRecreational and commercial boating is one of three a reas of transport activity\
  \ \nwhere no alcohol and drug limits or testing regime yet exists.  The introduction\
  \ of \nsuch a regime in any of these areas would be a major policy decision for\
  \ government \nthat would need to be informed by a thorough understanding of  the\
  \ problem and the \npolicy options.  The Ministry therefore intends to develop a\
  \ report to government on \nthe feasibility of a compulsory post -accident and incident\
  \ drug and alcohol testing \nregime for the aviation, maritime and rail transport\
  \ sectors.  \nAcco rdingly, implementation of recommendation 005/11 would only be\
  \ practicable \nonce the relevant policy work had been undertaken by the Ministry,\
  \ and then only if \nthe results indicated that a drug and alcohol testing regime\
  \ is a feasible option.  \n4.4.8.  Whether alcohol consumption contributed to this\
  \ accident or not, this is another case where \nabuse of alcohol in the maritime\
  \ workplace has been identified as an issue.  The Commission \nis convinced that\
  \ the feasibility report referred to  in the response to the recommendation \nshould\
  \ be given the utmost urgency.  \n \n  \nFinding : \nThe qualifications held by\
  \ the crew on the Anatoki should have been sufficient to navigate \nthe ship safely\
  \ on the voyage from Nelson to Tarakohe.  \nAt the time of the grounding there was\
  \ uncertainty between Maritime New Zealand and the \nowner of the Anatoki  on what\
  \ was a suitable level of crewing for a ship of that size and \ntonnage.  The complexity\
  \ of the relationship between New Zealand and international \nstandards for crewing\
  \ ships is an issue that New Zealand needs to resolve.  \nFinding : \nThe company\
  \ drug and  alcohol policy was not at the time of this accident complied with by\
  \ \nthe Anatoki 's master and crew.  \nFinding : \nThe owner and the master on board\
  \ the Anatoki  were not effectively managing the \nstandards of navigation and the\
  \ drug and alcohol policy at the tim e of the grounding.  \n \nReport 10 -202 \n\
