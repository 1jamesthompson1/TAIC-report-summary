Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Inadequate monitoring of the ship's progress: The mate did not adequately monitor the ship against the passage plan and the master's night orders, leading to the grounding.
2. Lack of a working bridge watch navigational and alarm system: The absence of such a system prevented the mate from being alerted in time to prevent the grounding.
3. Self-imposed sleep deprivation: The mate did not take enough rest before watchkeeping duties, resulting in acute sleep loss and potentially impaired performance.
4. Possible impairment due to alcohol consumption: The mate consumed alcohol before going on duty, which may have affected his performance and violated the company's drug and alcohol policy.
5. Insufficient qualifications and crewing standards: There was uncertainty regarding the suitable level of crewing for the Anatoki, and the qualifications held by the crew may not have been sufficient for safe navigation.
6. Ineffective management of navigation standards and drug/alcohol policy: The owner and the master did not effectively manage the standards of navigation and the drug and alcohol policy on board the Anatoki.
