- name: Inadequate Monitoring of Vessel Progress
  explanation: Inadequate monitoring of vessel progress is a safety theme that refers to the failure to continuously and accurately track the position and movement of a vessel against a planned route or passage plan. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate did not adequately monitor the ship's progress against the passage plan and the master's night orders. The report states, "The Anatoki ran aground because the mate was not adequately monitoring the progress of the ship against the passage plan and the master's night orders" (5.1). Additionally, the mate's failure to monitor the vessel's progress is further emphasized by the fact that "in the period immediately before the grounding, [the mate] could not have been monitoring the progress of the vessel at all" (5.1).
- name: Lack of Bridge Watch Navigational and Alarm Systems
  explanation: The lack of bridge watch navigational and alarm systems is a safety theme that involves the absence of equipment or systems designed to assist a watchkeeper in maintaining awareness of the vessel's position and to alert them to potential dangers. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the vessel did not have a working bridge watch navigational and alarm system that could have mitigated the risk of one-man bridge operations. The report indicates that "A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations" (5.2). The absence of such a system meant that the mate might not have been alerted in time to prevent the grounding (5.2).
- name: Self-Imposed Sleep Deprivation
  explanation: Self-imposed sleep deprivation refers to situations where individuals do not take advantage of available opportunities to rest, leading to fatigue and impaired performance. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate did not take enough of the ample opportunity he had to rest before being required for watchkeeping duties (5.3). The report also suggests that "The mate's performance was likely to have been adversely affected by his only having a maximum of 3.5 hours sleep in the preceding 21 hours" (5.4). The combination of limited sleep and the possible effects of alcohol consumption on the quality of sleep could have contributed to the mate's impaired performance (4.3.10).
- name: Alcohol Consumption and Policy Non-Compliance
  explanation: Alcohol consumption and policy non-compliance is a safety theme that involves the use of alcohol by crew members in violation of company policies, potentially impairing their ability to perform duties safely. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate consumed "4 to 5 pints of beer" before going on duty, and the master's tacit acceptance of this behavior indicated that the company's drug and alcohol policy was not being complied with (4.4.4). The report also finds that "The company drug and alcohol policy was not at the time of this accident complied with by the Anatoki's master and crew" (5.7).
- name: Ambiguity in Navigation Orders
  explanation: Ambiguity in navigation orders refers to unclear or impractical instructions given to the crew for navigating a vessel, which can lead to confusion and errors. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the mate deviated from the passage plan in accordance with the master's ambiguous night orders, which instructed to "stay 5 miles off the coast" if arriving early (4.2.2). The ambiguity of these instructions and their impracticality given the vessel's planned proximity to the coast contributed to the confusion and the eventual grounding of the vessel (4.2.2).
- name: Inadequate Post-Incident Testing for Alcohol and Drugs
  explanation: Inadequate post-incident testing for alcohol and drugs is a safety theme that involves the failure to promptly and effectively screen crew members for substance use following an accident, which can hinder the investigation into the causes of the incident. This theme is relevant to the Anatoki accident because the post-incident testing for alcohol and drugs was not carried out until more than 10.5 hours after the grounding, by which time it was unlikely that any alcohol would have remained in the crew's bodies (4.3.6). The report highlights that "For post-incident screening for alcohol and drugs in a person's body to be effective the screening should be carried out as soon as possible after the incident" (4.3.6).
