2010_202,019/12,The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand requires New Zealand-registered coastal vessels operating under one-man-bridge-operation to have a bridge watch navigational and alarm system to mitigate the known risk of sole watchkeepers falling asleep or becoming distracted from monitoring the progress of their vessels. (019/12),"A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations. Had one been fitted the mate might have been alerted in time to prevent the grounding.

2010_202,018/12,The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand resolves the correct level of crewing for the Anatoki and clarifies for industry the relationship between New Zealand and international crewing standards. (018/12),"At the time of the grounding there was uncertainty between Maritime New Zealand and the owner of the Anatoki on what was a suitable level of crewing for a ship of that size and tonnage. The relationship between New Zealand and international standards for crewing ships is unclear and appears complex.
