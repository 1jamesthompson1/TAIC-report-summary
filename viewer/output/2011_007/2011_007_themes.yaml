- name: Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is a critical safety theme as it ensures that all crew members are aligned with the expected actions and responses during flight operations, especially in emergency or non-standard situations. In this accident, the captain and first officer did not adhere to the company's SOPs for a "monitored approach" to the runway in poor meteorological conditions, which compromised the safety of the flight ("The captain and first officer did not adhere to company standard operating procedures for a 'monitored approach' to the runway in poor meteorological conditions" (4.2)). The captain failed to make the appropriate responses to automated calls prior to reaching the decision height, and the first officer did not challenge the captain for an appropriate response ("The captain did not make the appropriate response to two automated calls prior to the aeroplane reaching the point (decision height)" (5.1)). This non-compliance with SOPs eroded safety margins and contributed to the unsafe continuation of the approach.
- name: Crew Communication and Coordination
  explanation: Crew Communication and Coordination is a safety theme that focuses on the importance of clear and effective communication between all members of the flight crew to ensure safe flight operations. In this incident, there were multiple breakdowns in crew communication, such as the captain not acknowledging automated calls and the first officer not challenging the captain's lack of response ("The second breakdown in communication was the captain not acknowledging the next automated 'Plus hundred' call at 100 feet above decision height" (4.2.4)). The first officer's hesitation to challenge the captain may have been influenced by the captain's known minimalistic communication style and reputation for saying little on the flight deck ("The captain's communication style and his reputation could well have contributed to the observed breakdown in the communication loop during the approach to Christchurch" (4.2.15)).
- name: Management of Flight Crew Performance
  explanation: Management of Flight Crew Performance is a safety theme that involves the oversight and intervention by airline operators to ensure that their pilots are performing to the expected standards and adhering to procedures. In this case, the operator was aware of the captain's performance issues and tendency to not always follow standard communication procedures, but the informal method used to address the issue did not result in any measurable improvement ("the operator was aware of the captain's tendency over a period of at least three years to not always follow standard communication procedures" (4.3.4)). The lack of formal action by the company could have shown tacit acceptance of the captain's non-conforming practices, allowing them to continue virtually unchallenged ("The operator had not followed its own procedures for managing the previously identified performance issues with the captain" (5.6)).
- name: Stress and Cognitive Functioning
  explanation: Stress and Cognitive Functioning is a safety theme that recognizes the impact of stress on a pilot's ability to perform necessary tasks and make critical decisions during flight. The captain in this incident was likely operating under a level of stress that interfered with his cognitive functioning, as evidenced by his failure to initiate a missed approach when required ("The only appropriate decision was for the captain to commence a missed approach. He did not make that decision probably because he was operating under a level of stress, where anxiety was interfering with his cognitive functioning" (5.3)). The psychologist's review suggested that the captain was under evaluative stress due to the check flight, which could have affected his performance ("The psychologist's opinion was that from this captain's perspective, the check flight changed the normal dynamics on the flight deck" (4.2.20)).
- name: Crew Resource Management Training
  explanation: Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training is a safety theme that involves training flight crews to use all available resources, including each other, to ensure safe flight operations. The presence of the check captain on the flight deck and its effect on crew dynamics and communications had not been thoroughly discussed during the pre-flight briefing, which could have blurred the boundaries of individual involvement in the flight deck operations ("The presence of the check captain on the flight deck and its effect on crew dynamics and communications had not been thoroughly discussed during the pre-flight briefing" (5.5)). This lack of clarity may have contributed to the first officer's uncertainty about when to intervene and challenge the captain, highlighting the need for effective CRM training to manage such situations.
- name: Monitoring and Intervention by Check Captains
  explanation: Monitoring and Intervention by Check Captains is a safety theme that pertains to the role of check captains in observing and, if necessary, intervening in flight operations to ensure safety. In this incident, the check captain's role and the extent to which they would allow a situation to develop before intervening were not clearly defined, which may have contributed to the lack of timely intervention during the approach ("A common dilemma for check pilots is how far they let a situation develop to enable key lessons to be demonstrated before it becomes unsafe" (4.3.3)). The check captain's presence and the dynamics it introduced to the cockpit environment were factors in the incident, as they potentially influenced the first officer's actions and the captain's stress levels.
