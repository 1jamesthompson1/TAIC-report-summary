  \ is on an instrument approach  to a runway , it is a serious safety issue \nwhen\
  \ the pilot continues  with the descent below the minimum (decision) height without\
  \ having \nthe required visual references.  Decision heights are calculated  with\
  \ safety margin s to allow \nspecific aircraft type s to initiate safe missed  approach\
  \ es in the event of runway lights or \nmarkings not becoming visible.  If a decision\
  \ height is not heeded , safety margins are rapidly \neroded and there is a real\
  \ risk of the aeroplane landing w ith enough force to damage the \nlanding gear.\
  \  The consequences could be worse if the aeroplane were  not aligned correctly\
  \ \nwith the runway at the time . \n4.1.2.  In this case the runway approach lights\
  \ became visible at an estimated height of 100 feet, \nand the captai n was able\
  \ to land the aeroplane.  Both t he first officer and the check captain \nwere \
  \ just about to prompt the captain for a decision  when the runway lights became\
  \ visible .  \nAt a standard rate of de scent and standard approach speed, there\
  \ were  only about another \nfive seconds available for either the first officer\
  \ or the captain to react and arrest the rate of \ndescent to avoid striking the\
  \ ground before initiating a missed  approach, or to avoid a heavy \nlanding.  \n\
  4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses a number of rea sons for the captain not\
  \ initiating a missed \napproach  at the crucial time that he was supposed to. \
  \ It also discusses two other safety \nissues:  \n\uF0B7 that there was no intervention\
  \ from the first officer  in response to the captain not \nmaking the required calls\
  \ before reaching the decision height.  \n\uF0B7 that t he operator was aware of\
  \ performance issues with the captain and had not \nadequately dealt with those\
  \ issues.  \n \n4.1.4.  The investigation also considered  whether age-related factors\
  \ were  possible contributors to \nthe incident .  However, t here was no evidence\
  \ to support that pilot age was a factor \ncontributing to the incident (See Appendix\
  \ 2 for more detail. ) \n4.2. Human performance  \nStandard operating procedures\
  \  \nSafety issue  - The captain and first officer did not adhere to company standard\
  \ operating \nprocedures for a \"monitored approach \" to the runway in poor meteorological\
  \ conditions, \nwhich eroded safety margins built in  to the procedure s and compromised\
  \ the safety of the \nflight.  \n4.2.1.  The operator's normal practice  for making\
  \ an approach under instrument flight conditions  was \nto follow the  \"monitored\
  \ approach \" procedure , which was described as follows:  \nThe monitored approach\
  \ is a fully monitore d approach with the captain always being the [pilot flying]\
  \ \nand the [first officer] the [pilot monitoring].  The monitored approach allows\
  \ the captain the flexibility \nto assess the conditions and general conduct of\
  \ the approach.  This maximises the chances  of \nobtaining the required visual\
  \ cues at decision altitude.  \nThe [first officer's] duties are to monitor instruments\
  \ and [flight mode annunciators] and advise the \ncaptain of any deviation from\
  \ what is expected during the approach.  The captain's role is to  make any \nnecessary\
  \ decisions required during the approach and to scan for the required visual cues\
  \ as the \naircraft approaches decision height.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report\
  \ 11 -007 From 1500 [feet radar altimeter] or the [final approach fix] (whichever\
  \ occurs first) the [first officer] \nwill b e head down.  The [first officer] remains\
  \ head down until either the autopilot is disconnected \nafter touchdown or a go\
  \ -around is commenced18. \n4.2.2.  The flight proceeded uneventfully until the\
  \ final stages of the instrument approach at \nChristchurch.  At 1000 feet above\
  \ the runway threshold  the approach was \"stable \", which \naccording to the operator's\
  \ procedures meant the following criteria had been met:  \nthe landing gear had\
  \ been selected down by 1500 feet above aerodrome \nelevation  \nthe landing configuration\
  \ was established and landing checklist completed by \n1000 feet  \nthe a eroplane\
  \ was established on the correct glide  path  \nthe airspeed was not more than 10\
  \ knots above, or 5 knots below, target  \nthe sink rate was no greater than 1000\
  \ feet per minute  \nthe thrust setti ng was appropriate for the configuration (not\
  \ idle) . \n \n4.2.3.  The captain was required to  respond to the automated 1000\
  \ -feet call with the word \"stable \".  \nHe did not make that call, and the first\
  \ officer did not challenge or prompt him for a response . \nThe check ca ptain\
  \  believed he heard the captain  \"grunt\" .  Both later said that the captain's\
  \ \nlack of , or non -standard,  response was \"not unexpected\".  Neither w as\
  \ concerned at that point \nbecause they were aware that the aeroplane was on a\
  \ stable approach.  The first o fficer , \nhowever , should have prompted the captain,\
  \ because the operator's procedures required the \ncaptain 's lack of response to\
  \ be challenged .  This was the first breakdown in crew  \ncommunication in that\
  \  non-compliance with standard operating procedures went \nunchallenged.  \n4.2.4.\
  \  The second breakdown in communication  was the captain not acknowledging the\
  \ next \nautomated \" Plus hundred \" call at 100 feet above decision height  and\
  \ the first officer again \nnot challenging or prompting him for a response .  The\
  \ purpose o f this call was to prompt  the \ncaptain to look outside the cockpit\
  \ in preparation for deciding whether he had the required \nvisual reference  when\
  \ the aeroplane reached decision height .  The captain should have \nresponded by\
  \ saying , \"Confirmed \", which would ha ve been confirmation for the first officer\
  \ \n(who had his head down monitoring the instruments) that the captain was aware\
  \ of the \naeroplane 's situation and was still actively assessing  the approach\
  \  and external conditions .  \nThis second example  of not followi ng standard\
  \ operating procedures was more serious than \nthe first, because by that time the\
  \ aeroplane was close to the decision height.    \n4.2.5.  The aeroplane reached\
  \ the decision height about  nine seconds later, at which time the final \nautomated\
  \ voice call announ ced, \"Minimums\".  The captain was supposed to respond with\
  \ \neither \" Continue\" if he had the required visual reference  or \"Go  around\"\
  \ if he did not.  Again \nthe captain did not respond.  \n4.2.6.  The first officer\
  \ did not know if the captain was visual with the runway environment, or even if\
  \ \nthe captain was still in control of the aeroplane.  The first officer therefore\
  \ repeated the \n\"Minimums \" call then had to turn towards the captain to check\
  \ on h im before looking forward \nto see if they were actually visual.  As he was\
  \ about to react to the lack of visual cues, the \nrunway started to appear.  \n\
  4.2.7.  Instead of looking out of the cockpit when the \"Plus hundred\" call was\
  \ generated, the captain \nwas looking dow n at the flight instrument s.  He should\
  \ have been looking alternately inside \nand outside the aeroplane, assessing the\
  \ conditions and trying to obtain visual reference with \nthe runway as early as\
  \ possible.  When the decision height was reached and he looked  up for \nthe first\
  \ time , he saw only cloud.  This surprised  him and he wa s unable to react as\
  \ required  \n                                                        \n18 The procedure\
  \ was based on a fully automated approach and landing.  Where th e autopilot was\
  \ to be \ndisconnected before landing, it was assumed the first officer would look\
  \ up at this time.  Once visual the pilot \nmonitoring would call the existing rate\
  \ of descent to show the flight path was continuing to be monitored.  \n  \nFinal\
  \ report 11 -007 \n<< Page 11 >>\n and commence an immediate missed approach . \
  \ The possible reasons for this are discussed \nin the following section.  \nHuman\
  \ factors  \n4.2.8.  The captain was resident i n Christchurch and during the course\
  \ of his interviews he made \nreference to some personal health issues and the 2010\
  \ and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes, in \nparticular the effects of the aftershocks.\
  \  The captain said  that his health and the aftershocks \nhad ad ded to the stress\
  \ under which he was operating at the time of the incident.  The \nCommission's\
  \ consulting medical advisor19 reviewed  the captain's medical records , including\
  \ \ngeneral practitioner and CAA records .  The medical records were unremarkable\
  \ , contai ned no \nstress related issues  and nothing else was evident  that might\
  \ have affected h is ability to fly an \naircraft.  \n4.2.9.  The captain also offered\
  \ that he might have succumbed to a phenomenon commonly referred \nto as continuation\
  \ bias (also sometimes referred to as target fixation).  Continuation bias is a\
  \ \nnatural inclination to achieve a target or a goal  because they either want\
  \ t o or simply assume \nthey can.  If the inclination is strong enough in an individual\
  \ , they will press on even though \nchanging circumstances might make achieving\
  \ the goal difficult or unlikely.  \n4.2.10.  Bias is an inclination, predisposition\
  \ or prejudice towards an ob ject, action or emotion \n(Concise Oxford Dictionary).\
  \  There are many types of bias, including the cognitive biases of \n\"confirmation\
  \ bias \" and \"continuation bias \".  SKYbrary20 defines plan continuation bias\
  \ as  the \n\"unconscious cognitive bias to continue with  the original plan in\
  \ spite of [usually, adverse \nchanges in] conditions. \" \n4.2.11.  There are numerous\
  \ examples of pilots having continued with a flight plan or goal  despite \nadverse\
  \ chang es in   conditions, sometimes with tragic results.  The operator published\
  \ an \narticle in its 2010/2011 Summer issue of Koru Safe, their safety magazine,\
  \ titled \"The Drive \nto Arrive - Why Professional Pilots Get Press -on-it is\"\
  .  The article discussed the failure to \ninitiate a go -around as a major factor\
  \ in runway excursions, citing n umerous international \nexamples involving airliners.\
  \     \n4.2.12.  In New Zealand the January/February 2011 issue of the CAA's Vector\
  \ magazine  outlined two \nexamples of pilots continuing with their original plan\
  \ s despite changing conditions and \ninformation that did no t match their expectations\
  \ (CAA, 2011 ).  The article identified \n\"confirmation bias \" and \"frequency\
  \ bias \" as contributing to the accidents.  Confirmation bias \nis the tendency\
  \ to favour or accept information that supports  a pilot's expectation , and ignor\
  \ e \nor downgrad e information that may be contrary  to that expectation .  An\
  \ example of f requency \nbias is when a pilot lands at the same aerodrome without\
  \ any issues,  so expect s the same \noutcome each time . \n4.2.13.  For this incident\
  \ at Christchurch , the weather conditio ns and forecast information provided to\
  \ \nthe crew in the pre-flight briefing indicated that the weather conditions for\
  \ their expected time \nof arrival at Christchurch were marginal , warrant ing the\
  \ need to  take on extra fuel to reach an \nalternate aerodrome .  The updated ATIS\
  \ weather information obtained  at 0731  before \nbeginning the de scent showed\
  \ that the weather conditions had deteriorat ed, with temporary \nperiods of fog\
  \ predicted up until 0900 .  The visibility was expected to reduce to 1500 m in\
  \ \nmist and the cloud base expected to be broken at 200 feet .  With this forecast\
  \ there was still a \npossibility  they would have  visual contact with the ground\
  \ before  reaching  decision height . \n                                       \

  \ . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report 11 -007 4.2.14.  The ATIS information also\
  \ reported that the temperature and dew point were both 9\xBA Celsius, \nwhich indicat\
  \ ed that low cloud or fog could form at any time.  When the crew changed to the\
  \ \ntower frequency the controller advised  that the cloud was on the ground and\
  \ visibility had \nreduced to 800 m.  To emphasise the deteriorating conditions,\
  \  the controller also advised on \nthree  occasions that he was having difficulty\
  \ seeing the ATR that was ahead of the Boeing  \n(\"expect a late landing clearance\"\
  ) .  The crew were receiving information that should have \nalerted them that the\
  \ chances of making a s uccessful landing were diminishing .  The \nsignificance\
  \ of t his information could have been offset by the knowl edge that the ATR \n\
  aeroplane only two minutes ahead had made a successful landing.   Either way, the\
  \ reported \ninformation should have prompted a  discussion in the cockpit to consider\
  \ the possibility of a \nmissed approach . \n4.2.15.  The captain's communication\
  \ style could have been  described as minimalistic  - not wishing to \npromote interactive\
  \ communication.  He had a  reported reputation within the company for  \nsaying\
  \ little on the flight deck , and the first officer was aware of that reputation.\
  \  The captain's \ncommunication style and his reputation could well have contributed\
  \  to the observed \nbreakdown in the communication loop during the approach to\
  \ Christchurch.  I t could also \nexplain  why the first officer was unwilling to\
  \ challenge the lack of response to the 1000 -feet \ncall..  \n4.2.16.  Operating\
  \ procedures included  the requirement for the flight crew to cross -check and confirm\
  \ \nthe situation at c ertain  points.  One purpose of the procedures was  to prevent\
  \ human errors \nresulting in accidents or incidents.  If the captain had develop\
  \ ed a mind -set that he would \nbecome visual at decision height , this mind -set\
  \ needed to be broken and the most effective \nmeans would have been for the  pilots\
  \ to have followed normal procedures.  The  first officer \nshould have intervened\
  \ when the captain deviated from or omitted part of the established \nprocedure\
  \ s.  However , as mentioned above , the crew communication loop had been \nundermined\
  \  early in the a pproach . \nPsychologist review   \n4.2.17.  The Commission engaged\
  \ an industrial psychologist to explore the human factors element of \nthis incident.\
  \  The psychologist interviewed the captain on 28 June 2013, some 20 months \nafter\
  \ the incident.  The parties involved were aware that the elapsed time would affect\
  \ \nrecollections of the incident, but the focus of the interview was on enduring\
  \ human \nperformance traits that would be present and not the specific events o\
  \ f the day.  \n4.2.18.  The psychologist who interviewed the captain place d less\
  \ emphasis on the phenomenon of \ncontinuation bias and more on stress as a contributing\
  \ factor.  He said that typically  a number \nof environmental and human factors\
  \ will contribute to the occurrence of continuation bias.  \nFor example, the information\
  \ re quired to enable timely, evidence -based decisions is usually \nambiguous or\
  \ missing.  In this case , however, information about the weather and how it was\
  \ \nchanging was available.   The psychologist  said that pilots can develop the\
  \  perception of being \nunder pressure to act that becomes increasingly intense\
  \  as action is delayed, and that in  such \ncases there is usually an increased\
  \ sense of psychological threat as it becomes apparent that \nthe desired goal may\
  \ not be achieved.  It is t his latter aspect that can have the greatest \nnegative\
  \ impact, as the brain's typical response to a perceived threat is to activate the\
  \ \nprimitive \"fight, flight or freeze \" response.  Once activated, the stress\
  \ reflex can cause a \nnarrowed focus of attention and reduce the capacity of working\
  \ memory , which limits the \nability of a pilot to think clearly.  \n4.2.19.  The\
  \ psychologist considered the captain was operating under a relatively high level\
  \ of stress  \nduring the check flight , which was limiting his ability to percei\
  \ ve and react appropriately to \ntasks other than the immediate control of the\
  \ aeroplane .  The captain appeared to have \nhandled the major earth quakes of\
  \ 2010  and 2011 well, but said that the ongoing aftershocks \nalong with personal\
  \ health issues were a source of stress  for him .21  The psychologist \nacknowledged\
  \ that  these could  have been a factor, but when reviewing his longer history he\
  \ \n                                                        \n21 The operator had\
  \ provided support for Christchurch -based staff, including counselling if requested.\
  \  This \noffer was not taken up by the captain.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -007 \n\
  << Page 13 >>\n thought it more likely that the captain's  natural tendency to worry\
  \ , exacerbated by his \nactivities on the previous day (undergoing classroom emergency\
  \ procedures refresher training \nand assessment ) and the fact that he was undergoing\
  \ a route check , were  reason s for his not \nreact ing appropriately during  the\
  \ instrument approach.  \n4.2.20.  Both t he check captain and the first officer\
  \ agreed that this was just a routine check flight  that \ndid not affect the flight\
  \ deck dynamics.  However, the psychologist 's opinion was  that from this  \ncaptain\
  \ 's perspective,  the check flight changed the normal dynamics on the flight deck.\
  \  From \nhis perspec tive t he check captain was there to assess his performance,\
  \ and t his placed \nadditional \"evaluative stress \" on the captain , who did\
  \ not enjoy such exercises.  This may have \nbeen in part as a result of a previous\
  \ experience involving the same check captain.  During his \ninterview with the\
  \ psychologist the captain mentioned a previous check flight with the same \ncheck\
  \ captain.  He said that he \"did not find it a relaxing experience\".  Evaluative\
  \ stress differs \nfrom operational stress in that the focus of the ind ividual\
  \ is on how they are doing rather than \nwhat  they are doing.  This can introduce\
  \ a layer of internal mental monitoring (continu al self-\nassessment) that can\
  \ in extreme cases cause  mental blanks and acute anxiety to actively \ninterfere\
  \ with the primary task.   Similarities can be seen in other activities such as\
  \ public \nspeaking ('stage fright') and job interviews where the performance of\
  \ normally competent and \neffective individuals can be severely affected by mental\
  \ blanks and acute anxiety.  \n4.2.21.  Check flights  were not new to the captain.\
  \  According to the operator 's records he had \nundergone  47 previous  route \
  \ checks  and 94 simulator proficiency checks  over his 47 years \nwith the company\
  \ .  So how did this route check differ from the previous 47?  There are four \n\
  factors that probably  added to the stress the captain was under at the time:  \n\
  \uF0B7 his dislike for having his performance evaluate d \n\uF0B7 his past experience\
  \ involving the same check captain, which from the captain's \nperspective was a\
  \ negative experience  \n\uF0B7 the particular  circumstances of this approach and\
  \ landing in marginal weather \nconditions  \n\uF0B7 the other stressors he mentioned\
  \ regarding his health and his response to the \naftershocks to the Christchurch\
  \ earthquakes.  \n4.2.22.  Another factor considered was the captain's age.  He\
  \  was a ged 68 at the time of the incident.  \nThe subject of pilot  skill deterioration\
  \ with increased age has been studied internationally at \nconsiderable length ,\
  \ but thus far results have been  varied and largely inconclusive.   A \nsummary\
  \ of the information reviewed  is contained in Appendix 2.  In this case there was\
  \ no \nevidence to support the possibility that the captain's age was a factor affecting\
  \ his \nperformance during the approach to landing  \nFindings  \n1 The captain\
  \ did not make the appropriate response to two autom ated calls prior to the \n\
  aeroplane reaching the point (decision height) at which the flight  crew needed\
  \ to decide \nwhether to continue and land , or initiate a missed approach, and\
  \ the first officer did not \nchallenge the captain for an appropriate response\
  \ on either occasion . \n2 The captain compromised the safety of the flight by not\
  \ initiating a missed approach \nwhen the aeroplane reached  the decision  height\
  \ and the meteorological conditions were  \nnot suitable to land. \n3 The only appropriate\
  \ decision  was for the captain  to commence a missed approach .  He \ndid not make\
  \ that decision probably because he was operating under a level of stress, \nwhere\
  \ anxiety wa s interfering with his cognitive functioning . \n4 There was no evidence\
  \ to suggest that the pilot's age was a factor  affect ing his \nperformance on\
  \ the flight.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report 11 -007 4.3. Operator 's management\
  \ of crew performance   \nManaging  the cockpit  \n4.3.1.  Good communication between\
  \ a captain and first officer is critical to safe flight operations.  \nBoth need\
  \ to be fully aware of what the plan is and what checks are going to be made at\
  \ \ncertain points along the way.  The standard operating procedures together with\
  \ the various \nchecklists  help to form and verify that plan.  The dynamics of\
  \ the cockpit are affected by the \nmake -up of the flight crew, including their\
  \ personalities and any actual or perceived authority \ngradient.  The concept of\
  \ crew resource management is taught to overcome an d \"smooth \" the \ndynamics\
  \ so that any deviations from the plan can be challenged, confirmed or otherwise,\
  \ \nregardless of seniority or personality.  Adding a check captain to the usual\
  \ two-pilot cockpit \nhas the potential to  alter those dynamics, and it is impo\
  \ rtant that this situation be managed.  \n4.3.2.  In this case the first officer\
  \ should have challenged the captain on two occasions for not \nmaking the correct\
  \ response to the automatic calls generated by the aeroplane systems. The \nfirst\
  \ officer  was aware  that the cap tain was being assessed , but he said that this\
  \ was not an \nissue  as far as he was concerned.  However, the psychologist  was\
  \ of the opinion that any first \nofficer faced with the captain's uncommunicative\
  \ style , in a similar situation could have found  \nthemsel ves having to determine\
  \ the boundaries of their  involvement.  Stepping in too early to \ntake corrective\
  \ action or waiting too long for the captain to respond to a call  may have been\
  \ \nresented by the captain or seen by the check captain as interfering with the\
  \ check process.   In \nother words, b ecause the two pilots were meant to act as\
  \ a team , the first officer's \nperformance could be perceived as affecting  the\
  \ assessment of the captain's performance.  \n4.3.3.  A common dilemma for check\
  \ pilots is how far they let a sit uation develop to enable key \nlessons to be\
  \ demonstrated  before it becomes unsafe .  Therefore, emphasis needs to be \nplaced\
  \ on the briefing before the commencement of the flight.  The check captain said\
  \ that at \nthe pre -flight briefing he told the crew that i t was a route check\
  \ for the captain and that he was \nthere to observe.  Because of the captain's\
  \ experience he felt he did not need to elaborate \nfurther . \n4.3.4.  All parties\
  \ need to have a clear understanding of their individual roles and how they will\
  \ \ninteract.  F or example, a check pilot may state that they will not intervene\
  \ unless there is a \ndirect threat to safety .  In this case the first officer\
  \ would not have been  expecting intervention \nby the check captain when the captain\
  \ missed making the 1000 -feet and plu s-100-feet calls.  \nIt would have been clear\
  \ to him that any intervention needed to  come from himself, as \nrequired by the\
  \ company procedures.  \nPerformance management  \nSafety issue  - The operator\
  \ was aware of the captain 's tendency over a period of at least \nthree years to\
  \ not always follow standard communication procedures.  The informal method \nthe\
  \ company used to address the issue did not result in any measurable improvement.\
  \  \n4.3.5.  Files held on the captain by the C AA and the operator indicated that\
  \ the captain ha d generally \nperformed well in his regular assessments.  His training\
  \ records for the previous  15 years \ncontained several comments suc h as \"above\
  \ average check\" and \" cockpit manag ement is to \na high standard\" .  However,\
  \ there was some critical comment regard ing the use o f non -\nstandard communications.\
  \  \n4.3.6.  The records showed that in November 2008 the captain had performed\
  \ poorly in a simulator \nride because of a lack of knowledge of some drill s, and\
  \ required further training.  In the three  \nyears preceding this incid ent the\
  \ captain had had three  company operational occurrence \nreports filed against\
  \ him.  The reports had been submitted by a ground staff person and \nrelated to\
  \ the use of non -standard communications during push -back operations22.  The \n\
  captain recalled that he had received informal verbal follow -up action from the\
  \ Boeing 737 \nfleet manager or the manager's representative regarding each of the\
  \ reports.  On each \noccasion, the captain had agreed with the operator to try\
  \ to use standard phraseology .  \n                                            \
  \            \n22 The use of a tug or other vehicle to p ush an aeroplane back from\
  \ the terminal gate prior to engine start.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -007 \n<< Page\
  \ 15 >>\n However, when  interviewed following the incident he said  that he continued\
  \ to believe that \nmuch of the phraseology was unnecessary.   The operator later\
  \ commented that the same \nground staff person had made similar reports concerning\
  \ other pilots.    \n4.3.7.  In addition t he Commission received anecdotal evidence\
  \ from Air New Zealand pilots and \nother  employees that the captain  had a  reputation\
  \ for saying little to other pilots whilst flying , \nand abbreviating or omitting\
  \ items from checklists.  The first officer, who had not flown with \nthe captain\
  \ before, made reference to this in explaining why he did not challenge  the captain\
  \ \nfor failing to respond to the 1000 -feet call - \"The captain's lack  of response\
  \ was not \nunexpected \".   \n4.3.8.  The operator advised that any time there\
  \ was a reported non -adherence to procedures, a \"Just \nCulture \" investigation\
  \ was launched with the objective of understanding the behaviour  behind \nthe occurrence.\
  \  Air New Zealand s aid t he emphasis was on promoting an open reporting \nsystem\
  \ through the just and fair treatment of employees following an incident .  Disciplinary\
  \ \naction could be taken in the event of \"reckless behaviour\".  One outcome of\
  \ such an \ninvestigation was focused t raining for the individual concerned and\
  \ potential lessons learnt for \nother pilots.  \n4.3.9.  The process described\
  \ by the operator was not followed when dealing with reports against this \ncaptain.\
  \  The lack of formal action by the company in this case  had two possib le effects.\
  \  \nFirstly, it could have show ed a tacit acceptance of the captain 's tendency\
  \ to not conform with \nstandard communication procedures .  Secondly, the captain\
  \ himself could have believed that \nhe did not have to make any constructive efforts\
  \ to chang e the way he operated.  \n4.3.10.  The captain, on each occasion on which\
  \ he was reported, acknowledge d his error but \ncontinue d with his normal way\
  \ of operating.  The operator had a responsibility to ensure  that \nits pilots\
  \ were complying with its procedures.  Standardisation is essential for safe airline\
  \ \noperations.  This is especially so where there are a large number of pilots\
  \ , and where  first \nofficers  rarely team up with the same captains .  The operator's\
  \ stan dard procedures and \nregular crew resource management training are designed\
  \ with this in mind  \n4.3.11.  As a result of the incident the operator developed\

  \ flight  deck  and its effect on c rew dynamics and \ncommunications had not been\
  \ thoroughly discussed  during the pre -flight briefing , which \nhad the potential\
  \ to blur the boundaries of individual involvement in the flight dec k \noperations.\

  \ identified \nperformance issues with the captain.   This resulted in his continu\
  \ ing with non-conforming \npractices, virtually unchallenged . \n \n \n\n<< Page\
