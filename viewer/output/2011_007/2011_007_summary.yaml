- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The captain did not respond appropriately to automated calls, and the first officer did not challenge the captain's lack of response, indicating a reliance on expected actions without verification. "The captain did not make the appropriate response to two automated calls prior to the aeroplane reaching the point (decision height)" (5.1). This demonstrates human error and assumptions about the captain's actions by the first officer.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The breakdown in communication and the first officer's hesitation to challenge the captain indicate issues with CRM. "Good communication between a captain and first officer is critical to safe flight operations" (4.3.1). The presence of the check captain also altered the dynamics, which was not thoroughly discussed in the pre-flight briefing (5.5).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The captain and first officer did not adhere to standard operating procedures, compromising the safety of the flight. "The captain compromised the safety of the flight by not initiating a missed approach when the aeroplane reached the decision height" (5.2). This lack of adherence to procedures was a significant factor in the incident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The operator's informal method of addressing the captain's non-standard communication did not result in improvement, indicating issues with the safety culture. "the operator had not followed its own procedures for managing the previously identified performance issues with the captain" (5.6 (invalid formatted quote)).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the captain had undergone many checks and training sessions, his performance on this flight suggests there may have been gaps in his competency, particularly in stress management and adherence to procedures. "The captain, on each occasion on which he was reported, acknowledged his error but continued with his normal way of operating" (4.3.10).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The captain's lack of situational awareness when he failed to look outside the cockpit at the crucial moment contributed to the incident. "Instead of looking out of the cockpit when the 'Plus hundred' call was generated, the captain was looking down at the flight instruments" (4.2.7).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The deteriorating weather conditions and the captain's decision not to initiate a missed approach when visibility was poor were contributing factors. "The captain compromised the safety of the flight by not initiating a missed approach when the aeroplane reached the decision height and the meteorological conditions were not suitable to land" (5.2).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The lack of communication between the captain and the first officer, as well as the captain's minimalistic communication style, contributed to the incident.
