- name: Data and Research Limitations
  explanation: The theme of data and research limitations is highly relevant to this accident because the Commission found a significant lack of recent research examining the factors contributing to occurrences specifically in the context of flying training, both in New Zealand and overseas. This scarcity of information makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the state of flying training safety and to identify appropriate safety strategies. "There was virtually no recent research in New Zealand or overseas that examined the factors contributing to occurrences specifically in the context of flying training" (6.2). Additionally, the CAA's occurrence database has limitations that prevent accurate and meaningful analysis of flying training accident causal factors and historical safety trends, which further exacerbates the issue. "limitations in the caa's existing safety occurrence reporting and monitoring system... prevented an accurate and meaningful analysis of flying training accident causal factors and historical safety trends" (6.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).
- name: CAA's Safety Reviews and Reporting
  explanation: The theme of the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) safety reviews and reporting is pertinent to this accident because the CAA has not widely or periodically published comprehensive safety reviews that emphasize accident and incident trends, analyses of precursors, contributing factors, and lessons learned. This lack of systematic safety reporting hinders the enhancement of stakeholders' safety focus and the ability to identify systemic safety issues, trends, and risks within the flying training sector. "compared with other countries, the caa has not widely or periodically published any comprehensive safety reviews of aviation in new zealand... that have a major emphasis on accident and incident trends, and analyses of precursors, contributing factors and lessons learned" (6.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)).
- name: Quality of Flight Training
  explanation: The quality of flight training is a significant safety theme because the Commission was unable to conclude whether the standard of flight training in New Zealand presents risks to flight training safety. Without specific research examining the quality of the flight training system, it is challenging to determine if there are significant gaps that could contribute to safety risks. "The Commission was unable to conclude whether the standard of flight training in New Zealand presents risks to flight training safety" (7.4). Furthermore, there is a noted data gap regarding flight instructor demographics, performance, and competency levels, which should be addressed to ensure the quality of training. "General information about flight instructor demographics (e.g., qualifications, experience levels, age), performance and competency levels is difficult to obtain" (7.5).
- name: Effects of Increasing Air Traffic
  explanation: The effects of increasing air traffic on flying training and aviation safety are uncertain due to insufficient data and research on the matter. While international research suggests that increasing traffic could be a contributing factor to flying training occurrences, it is not a dominant cause. However, the risk is likely to be elevated with increased traffic. "The effects of increasing aviation activity in New Zealand on flying training and aviation safety in general are uncertain" (7.6). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for more data to understand how growing aviation activity impacts safety and to develop strategies to mitigate potential risks.
- name: English Language Proficiency
  explanation: English language proficiency is a relevant safety theme because poor English language skills have been identified as contributing factors in significant international accidents and some New Zealand occurrences. Although New Zealand has a framework for testing English language proficiency in civil aviation, anecdotal evidence suggests that language issues may still contribute to occurrences. "Anecdotal evidence suggests that poor English language proficiency and comprehension of English may have been contributing factors in some New Zealand occurrences" (7.9). Ensuring that pilots have adequate English language skills is crucial for maintaining safety in aviation operations.
