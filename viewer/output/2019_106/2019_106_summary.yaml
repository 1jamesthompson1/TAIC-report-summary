  explanation: 'The train controller mistakenly set the route for the West Main Line instead of the East Main Line, believing they had set it correctly ("the train controller reported that they thought they had set the route for the East Main Line", 3.6). The driver also assumed the route was correctly set for the passenger train based on the proceed signal on the bottom unit of 12R signal, without verifying the full signal indication ("the driver only observed a proceed signal on the bottom unit and acted on it in the expectation that the route was correctly set for the passenger train", 3.13).

- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: 'The train controller was recently qualified and had only been operating solo for eight weeks ("The MSL controller had been qualified to operate solo for eight weeks", 3.4). This lack of experience may have contributed to the error in setting the correct route. Additionally, all key personnel had undergone training in non-technical skills, but the incident highlighted the dangers that can still occur when non-technical skills are not used effectively ("All the key personnel involved in this incident had undergone training in non-technical skills", 3.33).

This lack of specific procedures may have contributed to the decision to disembark passengers in a non-standard manner.
