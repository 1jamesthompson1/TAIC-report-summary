  \ The safe separation of rail traffic and people on the rail corridor is a fundamental\
  \ \npremise of any rail operation. Robust and proven rules and procedures exist\
  \ that must \nbe followed by all personnel prior to their entering the rail corridor\
  \ to ensure that  \nsufficient protection is in place.  \n3.2 On this occasion,\
  \  two passengers were required to cross an operational railway track \nwithout\
  \ any means of protection because  the train had been directed onto the wrong \n\
  track in error.  \n3.3 The following section analyses the c ircumstances surrounding\
  \ the incident  to identify \nthose factors  that increased the likelihood of the\
  \ event occurring or increased the \nseverity of its outcome. It also examines any\
  \ safety issues that had the potential to \nadversely affect future operations.\
  \  \nUnintended  routing  \n3.4 On the day of the incident the MSL was being controlled\
  \ by a recently qualified train \ncontroller. The controller had completed 11 weeks\
  \ ' train control classroom training in \nMarch 2019, followed by 14 weeks ' live\
  \ training under the instr uction of a senior train \ncontroller. The live training\
  \ included learning to route passenger trains via the East \nMain Line at Rolleston.\
  \ The MSL controller had been qualified to operate solo for eight  \nweeks.   \n\
  3.5 Around the time of the incident the train contro ller was engaged in radio and\
  \ \ntelephone conversations with various work parties. The train controller reported\
  \ that \nthey were aware train 804 was due to arrive at the MSL control area and\
  \ had been \nmonitoring the train's progress on 'GeVIS', a KiwiRail soft ware application\
  \ that displays \na dynamic geographical location of trains on the network.  \n\
  3.6 Although the train controller reported that they thought they had set the route\
  \ for the \nEast Main Line in preparation for the arrival of 804, the route at Rolleston\
  \ wa s set for \nrail traffic to travel via the West Main Line. The train control\
  \ graph4 showed that the  \nmost recent  train movement through Rolleston had been\
  \  routed via the West Main \nLine about four hours earlier . Routing rail traffic\
  \ to either the East or West Main Line \nrequired the train controller to move \
  \ two sets of points , namely 1 and 7 points (see \nFigure 5).  \n3.7 The train\
  \ controller saw that train 804 was stopped outside the MSL control area at 12R\
  \ \nsignal.  Knowin g that passenger trains ran on a priority schedule and were\
  \ not to be \nstopped where it could be avoided , the train controller cleared 12R\
  \ signal to proceed.  \n3.8 Afterwards, on r ealising the route was set for the\
  \ West Main Line , the train controller \nimmediatel y attempted to set the correct\
  \ route using the East Main Line . However , the \nsignalling system was already\
  \ in the process of clearing 12R signal as set for the West \nMain Line and it rejected\
  \ any further commands from the train controller.  \n \n4 A diagram used by train\
  \ controllers to record all activity on the network under their control.  \n \n\
  Final Report RO -2019 -106 \n<< Page 7 >>\n 3.9 The relatively ine xperienced train\
  \ controller had not set the East Main Line in \npreparation for the arrival of\
  \ the passenger train. The unintended routing of the train \nto the West Main Line\
  \ was not in itself unsafe.  \nDecision to disembark passengers  \n3.10 On approach\
  \ to the MSL c ontrol area , the driver observed signals that indicated the \ntrain\
  \ would have to stop at 12R signal  (see Figure 6). The driver was aware that \n\
  stopping at the normal distance from 12R signal meant the train would be stopped\
  \ \nacross the Jones Road level crossing , which was  to the west of the signal\
  \ . This would \nresult in road traffic being blocked until the signal was cleared\
  \ . Because of this , the \ndriver decided to pull the train up as close as possible\
  \ to the signal  to clear the level \ncrossing behind the train.  \n3.11 By pulling\
  \ the train up close to the signal , the driver's view of the signal was partially\
  \ \nobscured from inside the locomotive . Only the bottom unit of the signal was\
  \ visible \n(see Figure 7). \n3.12 The driver reported that the train had been stopped\
  \ for about five minutes before 12R \nsignal was cleared and a proceed indication\
  \ on the bottom unit of the signal was \nobserved.  While the train was stopped\
  \ the driver saw 4R signal on the MSL , and noted \nit was at red (stop) (see Figure\
  \ 7). When 4R signal displayed stop , rail traffic travelling \ntowards Christchurch\
  \ on the MSL was prevented from entering the Rolleston section.  \nThe driver recalled\
  \ being aware of this.  \n3.13 Had the driver taken action to observe the entire\
  \ 12R signal and not just the bottom \nunit, they would very likely have  seen that\
  \ the top unit was showing that the route was \nset for the West Main Line. This\
  \ would have provided an opportunity for the driver to \nstop and speak to the tra\
  \ in controller and rectify the wrong -routing issue. However, \nthe driver only\
  \ observed a proceed signal on the bottom unit and acted on it in the \nexpectation\
  \ that the route was correctly set for the passenger train.   \n3.14 The driver,\
  \ having observed the proceed i ndication on 12R signal, began moving the \ntrain\
  \ towards Rolleston and entered the MSL control area.  \n3.15 The driver stated\
  \ that, a s the train rounded a left-hand curve towards Rolleston , they \nvisually\
  \ checked number 1 points . The driver stated that they saw they were set \ntowards\
  \ the West Main Line  and not the expected East Main Line.  \n3.16 The driver had\
  \ been informed earlier by the train crew that there were two passengers \nto disembark\
  \ at Rolleston.  The driver knew that travelling along the West Main Line \nmeant\
  \ the t rain would not be able to stop alongside the platform, which was required\
  \ \nto disembark passengers.  \n \n \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -106\
  \  \nFigure 6: Approach to 12R signal  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7: 12R signal as sighted\
  \ by the driver  \n \n3.17 The driver reported assessing the risk  of disembarking\
  \ the passengers onto the ballast \nbetween the tracks and  the passengers  walking\
  \ to the platform escorted by a member \nof the train crew. This assessment considered\
  \ : \n\u2022 knowledge of how the signalling system worked and the protection it\
  \ would \nprovide   \n\u2022 the clear view of the rail corridor in both directions\
  \ from the locomotive cab for \nany approaching rail traffic  \n\u2022 the short\
  \ distance the passengers would have to walk to the safety of the \nplatform . \n\
  3.18 The driver assessed that , under the circumstances , it was the safest and\
  \ most expedient \noption , and decided to proceed .  \n4R signal visible from \n\

  \ 9 >>\n 3.19 The driver com municated this decision to the train m anager, who\
  \ explained the \nsituation to the disembarking passengers . The train manager \
  \ reported to the driver \nthat the p assengers were willing to step down onto the\
  \ ballast and walk the 3.5 metres \nover the East Main Line and on to the platform.\
  \  \n3.20 The driver made no attempt to contact train control after becoming aware\
  \ that the \ntrain had been wrong routed , nor did they make contact with the onboard\
  \ service \nmanager (OSM )5 to discuss a plan for disembarking the passengers. The\
  \ OSM was \nresponsible for all aspects of passenger safety but was not included\
  \ in the decision -\nmaking  process regarding the passenger disembarkation. Th\
  \ e lack of effective \ncommunication is d iscussed further in section 3.33. \n\
  3.21 Once the train had  stopped on the West Main Line, the train m anager assisted\
  \ the two \npassengers from the train and waited until the y were clear of the rail\
  \ corridor before \ninforming the driver that the disembarkation was complete. \
  \ When the passengers \nstepped safely onto the platform , the driver began moving\
  \ the train and departed \nRolleston towards Christchurch.  \n3.22 Given the safety\
  \ implica tions of pas sengers walking across a track , it was an operation \nbetter\
  \ suited to oversight by the OSM. However, o n this occasion the OSM was left out\
  \ \nof the communication and decision -making  process.  When the OSM finally became\
  \ \naware of the events taking p lace, it was too late to intervene as the passengers\
  \ had \nalready disembarked.   \n3.23 While the driver was in charge of the overall\
  \ safe operation of the train, the OSM bore \nresponsibility for the safety and\
  \ wellbeing of the passengers. The OSM was assisted by \nthe train manager, who\
  \  was to follow the direction of the OSM in matters of passenger \nsafety.  \n\
  Communication between driver and train control  \n3.24 The train controller did\
  \ not attempt to contact the driver of train 804 after the train \npassed 12R signal\
  \ , and as a result remained unaware that passengers were \ndisembarking at Rolleston\
  \ until after the incident was reported to KiwiRail.  \n3.25 The lack of communication\
  \ between the train controller and the driver resulted in there \nbeing n o form\
  \ of blocking protection , other than that provided by the signalling \nsystem interlocking\
  \ , to protect the passengers crossing the East Main Line.  \n3.26 This would  have\
  \ potentially put the passengers who were crossing the track at risk had \nany rail\
  \ traffic be en in the same section.  \n3.27 Had the train controller and the driver\
  \ communicated to discuss the situation, the \nrequirement for the passenger disembarkation\
  \ would likely have become apparent and \na joint plan established to carry it out\
  \ safely.  \n3.28 The driver was o f the view that the disembarkation process could\
  \ be carried out safely ; \nhowever , it would have been prudent to advise train\
  \ control of the situation. Train \ncontrol had a more complete picture of what\
  \ was happening on the network, whereas \nthe driver based t he safety assessment\
  \ only on what was visible at the time.  \n \n5 The onboard service manager has\
  \ overall responsibility for the conduct of the on -board service crews and the\
  \ \nboarding and de -training of passengers.  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report\
  \ RO -2019 -106 Signalling system protection  \n3.29 Setting the signal at the northern\
  \ end of Rolleston to proceed  meant that signals could \nnot be cleared in the\
  \ opposite direction towards Rolleston . This effectively blo cked that \nsection\
  \ of track for the sole occupancy of train 804. \n3.30 Similarly, the signalling\
  \ system would not allow 4R signal (see Figure 5) to be set to \nproceed as it was\
  \  interlocked  with 12R signal to provide flank protection6. \n3.31 This combination\
  \ of signalling system protection on the East Main Line from the north \nand south\
  \ directions had the effect of blocking any train movements from entering \nRolleston\
  \ on the East Main Line while the passengers were crossing it on their way to \n\
  the platform . It would not , however , have had any effect on rail traffic that\
  \ could have \nalready been in the section at the  time.  \nNon-technical skills\
  \  \n3.32 The Rail Safety and Standards Board of the United Kingdom defines non\
  \ -technical skills \nas \"the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that\
  \ complement technical skills \nand contribute to safe  and efficient task performance\"\
  . While technical skills describe \nwhat you need to do and know for a given safety\
  \ -critical task, non -technical skills \ndescribe how you do that task. The non\
  \ -technical skill components can be broken \ndown further into sub -categories\
  \ that include situational awareness, conscientiousness, \ncommunication, decision\
  \ -making and action, co -operation and working with others, \nworkload management\
  \ and self -management.  \n3.33 All the key personnel involved in this incident\
  \ had  undergone training i n non -technical \nskills. Nevertheless, the incident\
  \ highlighted the dangers that can still occur when non -\ntechnical skills are\
  \ not used, or not used effectively . On this occasion , when  the train \nwas stopped\
  \ at 12R signal it was a good opportunity for the dr iver to confirm the full \n\
  signal indication.  It would have become immediately apparent that the train was\
  \ about \nto be wrong routed and should have triggered communication between  the\
  \ driver, \ntrain control and the train crew to regain situational awareness a nd\
  \ ensure there was a \ncommon mental model for all involved.   \n3.34 If the train\
  \ controller had been made aware before the train passed 12R signal that \npassengers\
  \ were disembarking at Rolleston , the route could have been corrected or \nelectronic\
  \ blocking7 could have been applied to provide additional  protection  for the \n\
  passengers crossing the East M ain Line. \n3.35 Similarly, h ad the O SM been included\
  \ in the driver's risk assessment and decision -\nmaking process , alternative \
  \ options for disembarking the passengers safely could have \nbeen considered ,\
  \ such as the passengers remaining on the train and returning by taxi \nto Rolleston\
  \ .  \n3.36 The w rong routing of the train by the train controller was a relatively\
  \ strai ghtforward \nsituation that could have been resolved  safely. Resolv ing\
  \ it required  a better use of \nnon-technical skills , particularly communication\
  \ skills , by all those involved.   \n \n6 A means of protecting movements of trains\
  \ across junctions by the setting of points (either manually or \nautomatically)\
  \ that prevent any other unauthorised movement coming into contact with them.  \n\
  7 A protection activated on the signalling system operated by train control , when\
  \ required , to ensure that signals \nand points are not cleared into a protected\
  \ work area or to prevent conflicting rail movements . \n \nFinal Report RO -2019\
  \ -106 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 3.37 The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission)\
  \ has raised the issue of \nnon-technical skills in several rail occurrence reports,\
  \ including in a recommendation to \nthe Chief Executive of Waka Kotahi NZ Transport\
  \ Agency (002/12):  \nThe Commission r ecommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ\
  \ Transport Agency that \n(the agency) require the Executive of the National Rail\
  \ System Standard to develop \nstandards to ensure that all rail participants meet\
  \ a consistently high level of crew \nresource management, a nd communication that\
  \ includes the use of standard rail \nphraseology.  \n3.38 As a result of this recommendation\
  \ KiwiRail implemented training programmes that \nincluded the principles of non\
  \ -technical skills. All personnel involved in this incident \nhad been trained\
  \ to some extent in these principles . This incident highlighted the \nimportance\
  \  of ensuring  that the principles remain prominent in workers' minds as an \n\
  important tool in planning for any safe -working scenario.  \n3.39 On 3 April 2017\
  \ , Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agenc y said it was continuing to work with \nKiwiRail\
  \ on addressing the recommendation. At the time of publication  the \nrecommendation\
  \ remains open.  \nProcedures  \nSafety issue: No procedures were in place to direct\
  \  train crews  and controllers  in the action to \nbe take n in the event of berthing\
  \ on the West Main Line. \n3.40 At the time of the incident there was no rule promulgated\
  \ by KiwiRail stipulating that \npassenger trains must travel via the East Main\
  \ Line at Rolleston, nor were there any \nprocedures recommending  action s to be\
  \ taken  in the event that a passenger train had \nto berth on the West Main Line.\
  \ KiwiRail relied on the local knowledge of train \ncontrollers to ensure that passenger\
  \ trains were routed cor rectly.  \n3.41 Since the incident KiwiRail has promulgated\
  \ Semi -Permanent Bulletin8 913, which \ninclude s new instructions for berthing\
  \ passenger trains at Rolleston and state s in part:  \nAll passenger trains must\
  \ be berthed on the East Main at Rolleston to facilita te \npassenger pick up and\
  \ set down.  \nException: The West Main may be used to berth passenger trains only\
  \ when the East \nMain is obstructed (e.g. disabled train, track fault) and authorised\
  \ by the Network \nControl Manager.  \nTrain crew are to be consulted on any West\
  \ Main berthing.  \n3.42 KiwiRail has also provided the Commission with a draft\
  \ version  of a train crew response \nplan for all passenger services on the KiwiRail\
  \ network throughout New Zealand . This \nplan outlines  the actions to be taken\
  \ to disembark passengers  safely  if passenger trains \ncannot be  berthed at a\
  \ platform.  \n3.43 Due to the actions taken by KiwiRail to address the issue ,\
  \ the Commission does not \nintend to make a recommendation on this matter.  \n\
  \ \n8 A means of promulgating a change to operating procedures or rules with immediate\
  \ effect, without having to \nchange the existing rulebook in entirety.  \n \n\n\
