- name: Mast Bumping Phenomenon
  explanation: Mast bumping is a critical safety theme as it is the central event that led to the in-flight breakup of the helicopter. The report states that "the helicopter suffered a mast bumping event that resulted in a main rotor blade contacting the cabin area and initiated an in-flight break-up" (5.1 (invalid formatted quote)). Mast bumping is a known issue with helicopters, particularly with Robinson helicopters, and has been involved in multiple fatal accidents that "have gone largely unexplained" (4.1.3). The report also notes that there have been 12 investigated accidents or incidents involving Robinson helicopters where mast bumping occurred, indicating a recurring safety concern (4.1.6).
- name: Lack of Flight Data Recording
  explanation: The absence of flight data recorders in small and medium helicopters is a significant safety theme because it hinders the ability to conclusively determine the causes of accidents like mast bumping. The report highlights that "a remedy for the lack of reliable data concerning specific accidents is to record flight data and cockpit video" (4.1.4). The Commission has made a recommendation to promote the need for cockpit video recorders and/or other forms of data capture to address this safety issue (4.1.5). Without such data, it is difficult to learn from accidents and make meaningful recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future (4.1.3).
- name: Pilot Response to Turbulence
  explanation: The pilot's response to turbulence is a safety theme because it is one of the factors that can potentially lead to mast bumping. The report discusses that turbulence, combined with pilot control inputs, can contribute to a low-G situation, which is a precursor to mast bumping (4.3.1). Robinson's opinion is that "turbulence alone does not cause mast bumping, but rather it is a pilot's control input in response to turbulence that creates the problem" (4.3.2). This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter may have encountered light to moderate turbulence in the valley (4.3.9), and the pilot's response to such conditions is a critical factor in the safety of flight.
- name: Helicopter Maneuvering and Airspeed
  explanation: The maneuvering and airspeed of the helicopter at the time of the accident are safety themes because they influence the likelihood of encountering a low-G situation that can lead to mast bumping. The report indicates that "the higher the speed, the greater is the risk of encountering a low-G situation" (4.3.26). In this accident, the helicopter's airspeed was at least 102 knots when the accident occurred (5.4), which is relevant because flying at high speeds increases the onset of low-G events and reduces the time for the pilot to respond appropriately (4.3.3).
- name: Training and Awareness of Low-G Conditions
  explanation: Training and awareness of low-G conditions are safety themes because they directly affect a pilot's ability to prevent and respond to situations that could lead to mast bumping. The report notes that in-flight demonstrations of low-G are prohibited for Robinson helicopters, yet there is evidence that some instructors in New Zealand have demonstrated the onset of the characteristic right roll that occurs in a low-G situation (4.3.14). This is relevant to the accident as it raises concerns about the adequacy of safety awareness training and the implementation of regulations designed to prevent low-G mast bumping accidents (4.3.32).
- name: Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Performance
  explanation: The performance of the ELT is a safety theme because it is crucial for guiding search and rescue efforts to an accident site, which can be the difference between survival and not in survivable accidents. In this case, the ELT was activated but torn from its mount, which led to a weaker signal that was not immediately detected by satellites (4.4.2). Although the accident was not survivable, the non-performance of the ELT is of interest as it highlights the need for reliable distress signaling devices, reinforcing the Commission's recommendations for improving the performance of ELTs (4.4.4).
