The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqu iries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 19 February 2015, a Robinson R44 helicopter was returning to Queenstown from a 
training flight  when it broke up in mid -air and crashed in bush near the Lochy River, killing the 
instructor and student.   
1.2. The helicopter broke up in mid -air when one of the main rotor blades struck the cabin, which 
was caused by a phenomenon known as mast bumping , when the inne r part of a main rotor 
blade or the rotor hub contacts the main rotor drive shaft . 
1.3. Mast bumping is typically caused by one or a combination of the following factors:  
 low main rotor revolutions per minute (RPM)  
 the helicopter entering a low-Gravity (low-G) condition (where the occupants might get 
the feeling of lightness or weightlessness)  
 turbulence  
 the pilot making large and abrupt movements with the helicopter controls . 
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( Commission ) could not conclusively 
determine what caused the mast bumping event .  We found that it was unlikely to have been a 
low main rotor RPM event  and could find no mechanical defect or failure that could have 
contributed to the accident . 
1.5. The student was about as  likely  as not  to have be en flying the helicopter when the accident 
occurred and the speed of the helicopter  was about as likely as not to have been 102 knots or 
greater as it flew down the valley, returning to Queenstown . 
1.6. Although the weather was generally calm and suitable for t he training flight , it was about as  
likely as not  that there were  pockets of light to moderate turbulence in the area.  Light to 
moderate turbulence should not on its own cause mast bumping, but when combined with a 
relatively high speed and a pilot's control response to any turbulence, there is a high risk of 
the helicopter entering a low -G condition, rolling rapidly to the right and suffering a mast bump 
event  before the pilot can react.  
1.7. The Commission comments on the safety issue  whereby the true c auses of mast bumping and 
in-flight break -ups are often not able to be determined because the accidents are usually fatal 
and the consequent destructive nature of the accidents makes it difficult to either eliminate or 
confirm mechanical failure as a cause . 
1.8. The Commission has made a recommendation  to the  Secretary for Transport and given notice 
to the  Director of the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to promote , through the appropriate 
International Civil Aviation Organi sation  forum, the need for cockpit  video recorders and/or 
other forms of data capture in the cockpit s of certain classes of helicopter to address this 
safety issue.  
1.9. The key lesson  arising from th is inquiry  is that helicopter pilots must be fully aware that a 
condition of low -G (feeling of lightness or weightlessness) can result in : a rapid right roll; mast 
bumping; and in -flight break -up before even the most experienced pilot can react and recover 
the situation.  Pilots need to fly in a manner that avoids low -G conditions rather than allow 
them  to develop and then expect that they can recover from them .

 Final report AO -2015 -002 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At about 1600 on Thursday 19 February 2015, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  of the  accident .  The Commission 
opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
Act 1990, because it believed that the circumstances of the accident had or were likely to 
have implications for transport safety , and because the Co mmission was already inquiring into 
two other break -ups involving Robinson helicopters . 
2.2. An investigation team  travelled to Queenstown on the morning of Friday 20 February  2015 .  
The team was given an initial briefing by the Police  and arrived at the accide nt site by 
helicopter at about 1320 .  The Police  assist ed with  the site examination  and two CAA safety 
investigators were given approval to conduct a parallel site investigation . 
2.3. The wreckage was removed from the accident site late on 21 February  2015 and transported 
to the Commission's examination and storage facility.  Commission investigators remained in 
the Queenstown area for several days, interview ing witnesses , the operator  (Over The Top 
Limited) and the families of the two victims .  Records for the h elicopter  maintenance  and for 
the pilots' training and experience were collected from the operator.  
2.4. On 21 February 2015  the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States (NTSB)  
appointed an Accredited Representative to the inquiry in accor dance with the provisions of 
Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation .2  The Accredited Representative 
appointed two senior air safety investigators from Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson ) as 
technical advisors, one of wh om travelled to New Zealand  to assist with the examination of the 
wreckage.  
2.5. One of the main rotor blades had fractured  near the change in chord3 - the point where the 
blade dimensions changed.  The CAA investigators identified that this fracture was in a sim ilar 
location  to that of a suspected fatigue failure in another R44 that the CAA was investigating  at 
the time .  On 22 February 2015 the CAA issued an airworthiness directive4 that ground ed  
R44s fitted with the C016 -7 model of main rotor blades  in New Zea land.  On 23 February  
sections of the fractured blade  from ZK -IPY were taken to a laboratory , where a metallurgist 
determined that the failure was impact  related  and not due to fatigue. T he CAA then cancelled 
the airworthiness directive.  
2.6. On 26 and 27 February 2015 the investigation team and a Robinson  technical advisor 
examined the wreckage of the helicopter more closely  at the Commission's storage facility .  On 
5 March 2015 the engine was taken to a maintenance facility where a complete t eardown 
examination was performed in the presence of a Commission investigator.  The examination  
included the testing of engine accessories.  
2.7. The clutch was subsequently examined by a licen sed engineer familiar with the R44 and 
clutch assembly.  
2.8. On 11 March 2015 a representative of the operator was permitted to inspect and photograph 
the wreckage, under supervision, at the Commission's examination and storage facility.  
2.9. On 25 March 2015 the CAA files on the operator, helicopter and instructor were reviewed.  A  
meeting was also held on the same day with CAA staff to discuss this accident and other 
related Robinson helicopter accidents.

 2.10.  On 8 June 2015 the Commission requested specialist assistance from  the Australian 
Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) , which  opened a n investigation and appointed an Accredited 
Representative  and a technical advisor.  Both personnel were experienced in accidents 
involving Robinson helicopters .  The technical advisor , a senior investigator,  held a licen sed 
aircraft maintenance engineer qualification  and a Diploma of Transport Safety Investigation, 
had completed the Robinson helicopter maintenance course and was trained in fracture 
analysis . 
2.11.  On 1 6-18 June 2015 the ATSB technical advisor examin ed the wreckage  with the investigation 
team .  In the period  8-10 July 2015 the Chief Investigator of Accidents , the investigator in 
charge , the ATSB Accredited Representative and his technical advisor  analysed the available 
evidence and examined various hypotheses for the accident . Further enquir ies w ere initiated 
as a result.  
2.12.  On 31 July 2015 the fracture d surfaces of the  main rotor blades were sectioned off and sent 
to the ATSB for examination.   On 14 September  2015  the ATSB provided a report to the 
Commission on th at examination.  
2.13.  On 9 November 2015, on behalf of the operator , a licen sed aircraft maintenance engineer 
with air accident investigation experience examined the wreckage .  This took place  under the 
supervision of Commission investigators at the Commission's examination and storage facility . 
2.14.  The helicopter had been  fitted with a TracPlus5 satellite tracking system.  Recorded 
information from this system was used to help determine the flight path of the helicopter.  
2.15.  On 27 April 2016  the Commission approved this report  for circulation to intereste d persons  for 
comment.   Eight submissions were received and considered by the Commission.  Any changes 
as a result of those submissions have been included in this final report.   
2.16.  On 4 July 2016 the emergency locator transmitter  (ELT)  installed in the helic opter was 
examined by the New Zealand agent for the manufacturer (K annad) to establish whether it 
performed as designed.   
2.17.  The Commission approved this final report for publication on 27 July 2016 .

 Final report AO -2015 -002 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  The Robinson R44 heli copter registered  ZK-IPY (the helicopter ) was owned and operated  by 
Over  The Top Limited  (the operator ), based in Queenstown.  The helicopter was typically  used 
for local scenic flights  for two or three passengers , and for familiarisation flights .  On Thursday 
19 February 2015 the helicopter was not being used and was available for training.  
3.1.2.  One of the operator's pilots, who was also an instructor, a pproached the son of the company 
owner  during the morning and asked if he would like to go flying.  They had flown together the 
day before as part of ad hoc  training for the son (referred to hereafter as the student) .  The 
student accepted the offer as this was likely to be the last opportunity for a flight before he 
headed overseas  to university . 
3.1.3.  At ab out 1225 the helicopter was started and hover -taxied to a nearby refuelling pump , where  
it was shut down and  94.2 litres of  fuel were added.  At about 12 40 the student called 
Queenstown tower requesting a take -off clearance.6  The helicopter wa s cleared for take-off 
and instructed to vacate the control zone to Collins Bay not above 6 ,500 feet.    
3.1.4.  The a ir traffic service 's surveillance system showed that the helicopter  departed the 
aerodrome at 1243 , flying initially to the south before turning right to cross Lake Wakatipu to 
the north end of Collins Bay.  The helicopter steadily climbed to an altitude7 of 3,050 feet - 
about 2,000 feet above the lake.   
3.1.5.  Approaching the far shore , the helicopter descended to about 500 feet above the lake and 
turned right to fly along the shoreline .  The helicopter flew northwest for about one kilometre  
(km)  before reversing direction to fly in a southeast  direction just inland  of the shore .   
3.1.6.  A witness , who  was herding some sheep close to  the shoreline , saw the helicopter 
approaching  after it had crossed the lake .  He recognised the helicopter 's paint scheme  
because  the operator regularly conducted training at locations around the farm and adjoining 
propert ies.  The helicopter flew above the witness before return ing back towards the 
southeast .  As the helicopter approached the second time  the instructor called the witness by 
mobile phone.  They talked briefly , including  comment ing on the good weather.  As the 
helicopter continued along the shoreline, it climbed steadi ly before turning inland.   
3.1.7.  The last surveillance  record of the helicopter was at 1252 , when  the helicopter was  flying up 
Collins Creek , behind Collins Bay, heading toward s the Lochy River valley about 3 km  away.  
The helicopter was maintaining  about 2,350 feet above mean sea level  (about 1,000 feet or 
300 metres [m] above the floor of the valley  at this point ), flying at a groundspeed of about 
100 knots .8  
3.1.8.  The helicopter was fitted with a satellite tracking system that  every  two minute s provided a  
report of the helicopter's position, altitude and groundspeed.  (See paragraph 4.3.19 and on  
for more information on the tracking system and data. )  The tracking data was sent 
automatically to the operator's base where it could  be displayed on a monitor.  The data 
showed th at the helicopter enter ed the Lochy River valley and fl ew approximately 15 km up 
the river before conducting various  manoeuvres  (see Figure 1) .  
                                                        
6 Before departure the student was observed sitting in the right seat and the ins tructor in the left seat.  These 
were the normal seating positions for an instructional flight.  
7 Altitudes in this report are referenced to mean sea level, while heights are above the terrain.  
8 A knot is a speed of one nautical mile per hour .

3.1.9.  A farmer and farmhand , who were  working several kilometres further up the Lochy River from 
where  the helicopter was operating,  observed it flying in what w ere described as 'circuit -like' 
manoeuvres.  The helicopter would descend and slow, coming to a hover in an open area for a 
period before taking off and flying around again.   These manoeuvres continued for about 35 
minutes.   
3.1.10.  At 1338 the helicopter started flying down the river  towards Quee nstown , climbing as it 
followed the valley.   The last tracking report was made at 1340:30 , when  the helicopter was at 
an altitude of about 2 ,900 feet , or about 1 ,200 feet above the ground, and near the centre of 
the valley.   The helicopter groundspeed was 102 knots o n a track of 032° True  at this time .   
3.1.11.  The instructor needed to be back in  Queen stown by 1400 to meet a potential buyer for one of 
the operator's other helicopters.  The potential buyer was to arrive at this time and after 
inspecting the helicopter go for a flight  with the instructor .  At 1347  a staff member called the 
instructor  on the radio to advise that the flight had been cancelled.  The staff member was 
unable to raise a response , so checked the tracking display .  She saw that  the tracking had 
stopped  some six minutes earlier  when the helicopter was still in the Lochy River valley .  The 
staff member talked to  management , who had also become concerned about the flight .  The 
staff member then  sent a text message to  the instructor and student, and phon ed the 
aerodrome tower controller to see if they had contact with the helicopte r.  The staff member 
also started  an 'Overdue Aircraft Checklist' during this time.  
3.1.12.  At 1411 three of the operator's staff took off in a second helicopter and head ed to the last 
recorded position of the helicopter.  The Police were informed and, in conjunction with the 
Rescue Coordination Centre, started organising a search.   At 1416 t he operator's se arch 
helicopter entered the Lochy  River  valley , and shortly after wards  started a  search of the area .  
After finding nothing the operator's se arch helicopter proceeded up the Lochy R iver valley 
where the  pilot and passengers  located the farmer and farmhand  who were returning down 
the valley along a track.  The operator's search helicopter landed near the pair , who advised 
that the helicopter  was last se en heading down the valley .   
3.1.13.  The farmer  was familiar with helicopters  and boarded the operator's search helicopter to 
assist  with the search .  The farmhand continued down the track and remained in contact 
using  a hand -held radio.  The operator's  search helicopter spent the next 70 minutes

 Final report AO -2015 -002 searching the valley and side gullies.  The pilot and passengers on the operator's  search 
helicopter hear d a faint ELT signal  over the radio , but were unable to obtain a bearing on the 
weak and  intermittent sign al.  At about 1540  the operator's search helicopter was joined by a 
second helicopter organised by the Rescue Coordination Centre . At about this time  the 
farmhand radioed that he had found  some wreckage  near the track .  The main wreckage  was 
found soon afterwards  (see Figure 2) .  The bodies of the two pilots were found close to the 
main wreckage.  They had died from severe traumatic injuries.

Accident site  
3.2. Site information  
3.2.1.  The accident site was 12 nautical miles (21 km) southwest of Queenstown airport (see Figure 
3).  The site was on the western side (true left) of the Lochy  River, in a narrow section of the 
valley at an altitude of approximately 1 ,450 feet (440 m).  The immediate area was covered in 
beech trees approximately 80 feet (25 m)  high.  The wreckage was spread over an area 
approximately 200 m by 200 m (see Figure 4 ).  A farm track ran through the centre of the 
accident site.   
3.2.2.  From the last known position of the helicopter to the accident site, the first item in the 
wreckage trail was a rear section of the left skid.  To the right of this on the river bed was a 
radio controller box that had been installed at the base of the instrument panel at the front of 
the helicopter.  The main wreckage, consisting of the fuselage, tail boom, engine, transmission 
and most of the main rotor, was 110 m further on, approximately 30 m north of the farm 
track.  
3.2.3.  Between the start of the wreckage trail and the main wreckage was a range of helicopter 
components and personal items.  These included individual instruments, the upper instrument 
console, the left cyclic control  handle , a tail rotor pedal and footwear.  Approximately 100 m to 
the east of the main wreckage and near the river were  the main fuel tank and the outboard 
part of (red) main rotor

 2.3 m of the red main rotor blade.9  Pieces of Perspex and cabin structure were found 
throughout the accident site.  
3.2.4.  Several items were seen suspended in the tree canopy.  The largest was a section of fuselage 
panel from above the engine and behind the main rotor mast .10  This was recovered by using 
the rotor downwash from a helicopter to blow the panel free.   
3.2.5.  The main f uselage was resting nearly upright on the forest floor.  It lay against a tree that had 
significant gouging down one side, consistent with the fuselage having slid down the side of 
the tree.  The tail boom remained partially attached but bent at nearly 90º  to the fuselage.  
The tail rotor assembly and empennage from just forward of the tail rotor gear box had 
separated and lay 2 -3 m from the end of the boom.

 3.2.6.  The engine, transmission, mast and main rotor hub assembly were still connected but had 
twisted to the left.  The blue main rotor blade had broken off 1.4 m out from the hub.  The 
outboard section, approximately 3.5 m long, lay about 5 m from the fuselage.   The red main 
rotor blade had two 90º downward bends at 0.6 m and 2.5 m from the hub.  The blade had 
separated 0.4 m outboard of the second bend.  The separated tip end was found near the 
river.   
3.2.7.  The student and instructor had been flung forward from the ir seats during impact. When the 
fuselage was lifted, the right handle for the cyclic control was found under where the fuselage 
had been.  Both of the pilots' lap -diagonal seatbelts were found buckled but had failed where 
the straps that held the release lever s were anchored to the airframe between the two seats.  
The inertia reels functioned normally.  
3.2.8.  The damage to the trees, the ground markings and the wreckage damage and its spread were 
consistent with the wreckage having fallen nearly vertically throug h the forest canopy in a near 
level or flat attitude.  
3.2.9.  Several pieces of broken instruments and a section of the front canopy bow were found after 
the helicopter wreckage had been removed from the accident site.  
3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  ZK-IPY was a Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter , serial number 10555, manufactured in 
November 2004 .  It was powered by a single Textron Lycoming IO -540-AE1A5 normally 
aspirated engine, serial number L -29707 -48A.  The helicopter was imported into New Zealand 
and registered by the  operator in January 2005.  
3.3.2.  At the time of the accident the helicopter had accrued a total of 1 ,529 hours .  Records 
showed that the helicopter was being maintained in accordance with the approved 
maintenance manual and Robinson instructions.  The last maint enance inspection had been  a 
scheduled 50 -hour check carried out on 9 February 2015, 10 days before the accident.  An 
annual review of airworthiness had been  completed at the same time.  The helicopter had 
since flown 19 hours without any reported defects .   
3.3.3.  Maintenance requirements for the helicopter included a daily inspection of the tail rotor 
blades and main rotor blades for potential fatigue cracking.  Aircraft documentation and 
interviews with other pilots who had flown  the helicopter showed that  these requirements had 
been  complied with.  
3.3.4.  The weight and centre of gravity11 of the helicopter when it departed Queenstown w ere 
calculated using the recorded basic weight of the helicopter , the reported weights of the two 
pilots , and the weight of fuel  and additional survival items carried on board. It was determined 
that the helicopter had departed with  full fuel tanks.  The take -off weight was calculated to be 
987 kilograms  - the maximum allowable weight was 1,134 kilograms.  The centre of gravity 
was calculated to be 245.36 c entimetres  aft of the datum ; within the allowable range of 
between 234 and 257.8 c entimetres .  The lateral centre of gravity was within limits, close to 
the centreline of the helicopter.  
3.3.5.  The helicopter centre of gravity continued to be within the limits for the duration of the flight.   
The weight at the time of the accident was calculated to be about 940 kilograms.    
Wreckage examination  
3.3.6.  Appendix 3 gives a more detailed account of the wreckage examination.  All major 
components of the helicopter, including flight and engine controls, main rotor and tail rotor 
assembl ies, landing skids and fuselage were accounted for at the site and  removed for further 
examination.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 Flight controls  
3.3.7.  Dual  flight controls had been installed.12  The cyclic control  or stick had broken off near the 
floor.   Both the left and the right cyclic extension  handles  had been broken off, with the left 
extension  handle  having  an impact mark that matched the  curve of the  leading edge of a main 
rotor blade.   
3.3.8.  The c onnectivity of the flight controls through to the main rotor and tail rotor was established.  
No evidence of pre -impact failure or problems was found.  
Engine and controls  
3.3.9.  The engine cooling fan displayed scoring around its perimeter and on the inlet cone surfaces , 
indicating that it was turning at the time of the accident sequence .   
3.3.10.  The drive belts were intact, although  one had a partial longitudinal split.  There was no 
evidence that the belts had rolled off .  The clutch was found to lock and free -wheel normally.   
The clutch was subsequently examined by a licen sed engineer familiar with the R44 and 
clutch assembly.  The clutch assembly showed "virtually no sign of in -service wear" .  Tear 
damage was found on the  inner race, which matched marks on the same end of each pall.  
The damage was in the direction of drive . 
3.3.11.  The engine was removed and taken to an approved  aircraft engine  overhaul facility and  
subjected to a bulk strip inspection13 under the supervision of a Commission investigator.  
Maintenance records matched the engine and all applicable airworthiness directives were 
found to have been embodied . 
3.3.12.  Engine accessories, including the magnetos, fuel control unit and fuel pump were all removed 
and tested, with no defects found.  The fuel c ontrol unit was free of any contamination. The 
testing of the fuel flow divider did identify a "slightly restricted flow due to tiny metallic particle 
contamination " for the #5 nozzle.  
3.3.13.  In summary, the engineering company determined that "no evidence was fo und of any pre 
impact defect that would have affected the engine's ability to run.  The restriction in the #5 
nozzle may have caused the engine to run slightly rough with minor power loss ". 
3.3.14.  Both fuel tanks had separated from the fuselage and had significan t deformation.  Both tanks 
had bladders installed and their caps were in place.  The tanks were found empty .  However , 
the smell of fuel about the wreckage and the heavy ground indent where the main tank had 
landed indic ated that both tanks had contained s ome fuel on impact. The main fuel filter 
('gascolator ') was intact and found to contain fuel that was consistent with the correct fuel for 
the helicopter.  The filter screen was clean and vent lines free of obstruction.  
Main and tail rotor s  
3.3.15.  Both of the pitch change links , which  connect the swashplate to the main rotor blades and 
control the pitch angle of the blades, had failed in overload14, likely  after  a reverse bending 
motion  (see Figure 5).  Both teeter stops were split horizontally through the middle,  and the ir 
retention brackets were bent.   
3.3.16.  Both main rotor blades had fractured  (see Figure 6) .  Because the f racture of the red blade 
was near the point where another R44 blade had failed , which the CAA suspected had been 
due to  fatigue, the Commission had this blade examined by a metallurgist at the earliest 
opportunity.  The metallurgist's  initial assessment was that the blade had failed in  overload. 
Subsequent detailed examination by the same laboratory and a further examination by an

 ATSB metallurg ist confirmed this .  The ATSB also determined that the failure of the blue blade 
was the result of overload and not fatigue , with the blue blade exhibiting "significant plastic 
deformation in the region of the fracture surface consistent with an overstress fai lure" .  Both  
blades were examined for signs of any pre -existing delamination or dis-bonding,  and none was 
found.15

Main rotor blade damage  
3.3.17.  The intermediate and aft flex ible couplings were bent and separated. The gearbox and tail 
rotor assembly had separated .  The gearbox was able to be rotate d freely.   
Instruments and readings  
3.3.18.  The upper instrument console, found near the start of  the wreckage trail, had a deformation 
consistent with having been  struck by a main rotor blade.  The instruments normally held by 
the upper console had been dislodged, with the exception of the  vertical speed indicator.  
Most of the warning lights at the top of the console were either broken or missing.  The only 
light showing evidence of 'hot stretch'16 was the clutch light.  None of the temperature 
indication stickers on gear boxes and the hydr aulic pump showed any evidence of excessive 
heat having been generated in these components.  
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The instructor was aged 42 years.  He had begun his piloting  career  with the British Royal 
Marines  in March 1998 .  In September 2003 he migrat ed to New Zealand, obtaining his New 
Zealand commercial pilot licence on helicopters in November 2003.  The instructor flew the 
Robinson R22 in preparation for his commercial flight test.  During this time he also 
completed the required Robinson safety awa reness training .17   
3.4.2.  The instructor joined the operator in August 2004  and obtained his R44 and AS350 Squirrel 
helicopter rating s shortly afterwards.  He occasionally flew the R44, but predominantly flew 
the AS350 on local area scenic flights .  On 23 August  2005 the instructor completed further 
Robinson safety awareness training as part of his annual competency check , which was flown 
on the R44.   
3.4.3.  In June 2007 the instructor left the operator and  joined another helicopter company that 
performed flight traini ng.  As part of the instructor's R22 re -familiarisation and instructor 
training, he again completed Robinson safety awareness refresher training.  He obtained his 
C-category instructor qualification  on 9 July 2007.  He then instructed on both the R22 and 
                                                        
16 When a bulb is illuminated, the filament is heated and therefore ductile.  When subjected to a sudden and 
large load, the filament will stretch before breaking.  The result is 'hot stretch', sometimes termed a  bird's 
nest.  The opposite is a cold, brittle failure with no filament stretch.

 R44 helicopters.  On 13 November 2008 the instructor obtained his B -category instructor 
qualification.  
3.4.4.  In July 2010 the instructor returned to fly with the operator for two years.  During this time he 
completed further Robinson safety awareness refresher training, which includ ed a flight in an 
R22.  He also presented safety awareness training on several occasions.  He then flew 
helicopters in Papua New Guinea for  20 months before returning to New Zealand and re -
joining the operator in August 2014.  
3.4.5.  At the ti me of the accident the instructor had accrued a total of 4,703 flying hours, including 
4,527 hours flying helicopters.  He had flown 2 ,145 hours on Robinson helicopters, including 
950 hours on the R44.  The instructor's logbooks recorded that he had flown 2,435 hours of 
mountain flying and 1 ,380 hours of instruction, nearly all in Robinson helicopters  and most ly 
in the R22.   He had flown about 37 hours in the R44 since re -joining the operator in August 
2014, including giving 13 hours of instruction.  
3.4.6.  The ins tructor's last competency  check and biennial flight review had been  conducted on 29 
August 2014 and was flown in an AS350 Squirrel. On 29 September 2014  he completed his 
B-category instructor renewal  in R44 ZK -IPY, the accident helicopter .   
3.4.7.  The instructor  held a current class 1 medical certificate valid until  21 February 2015.  He had 
attended a medical examination on 4 February 2015 for the renewal of his certificate and 
been assessed as fit .  The replacement certificate was in the process of being issued  at the 
time of the accident.  
3.4.8.  In the 48 -hour period preceding the accident , the instructor had flown three flights totall ing 
5.2 hours, including a training flight with the student on the day before the accident.  This was 
recorded in the student's logbook  as transitions and introduction to the circuit.18  In the seven -
day period he had flown six flights totall ing 10.3 hours.  Th ese included 2.5 hours in the R44, 
of which 1.7 hours were giving instruction.  The instructor was observed to be fit and healthy 
on the day of the accident.  
3.4.9.  The student was aged 18 years.  Since the age of about eight  years he had often accompan ied 
pilots while they were undertaking commercial passenger flights on the operator's helicopters.  
His pilot logbook recorded that he had flo wn a total of 10 hours  of training flight in the R44  
helicopter .  The first flight had been a 'familiarisation ' flight in 2005.  He had next flown twice 
in 2012.   
3.4.10.  The frequency of the student's flying had increased from April  2014 until the accident flight , 
when he flew nine flights and accumulated a further seven hours of flying experience .  He flew 
one flight in December 2014, involving take -offs and landings and an introduction to flying 
'the circuit '.  During February 2015 he flew four flights , three with the instructor and one with 
another of the operator's pilots who was also a B -category instructor.  The four flights flown on 
11, 13, 15 and 18 February totalled three  hours of dual instruction  and were all in the 
accident helicopter .  The exercis es that were flown included transitions, hovering, introduction 
to the circuit and autorotations.19     
3.4.11.  The student was reported to be in good health on the morning of the accident . 
3.4.12.  The toxicology re sults for the instructor and student  were negative for any  performance -
impairing substances .

19 Transition is the term used to describe a helic opter moving from a hover into forward flight or from forward 
flight to a hover.  Autorotation is when the main rotor system is driven by the flow of air up through the rotors, 
instead of by the engine.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 3.5. Meteorological information  
3.5.1.  The New Zealand Meteorological Service area forecast predicted light northwest winds from 
the surface to 10,000 feet  for the period of the flight .  The cloud was predicted to be broken20 
with a base of 5,000 feet, lowering to 3,500 feet in rain showers .  Isolated cumulous nimbus 
or towering cumulous were forecast to develop during the afternoon and to dissipate in the 
evening.  These would be associated with isolated showers.  Isolated mo derate turbulence 
during the morning was expected to ease in the afternoon.  
3.5.2.  The three witnesses who observed the helicopter after it crossed the lake and as it flew into 
the valley said the day was fine and warm.  The wind conditions on the ground were generally 
calm or near calm, with an occasional light gust passing through.  The witnesses aboard the 
helicopters involved in the subsequent search reported similar conditions.  
3.5.3.  Air traffic service staff  at Queenstown airport re corded the surface wind  during the late 
morning an d early afternoon  as southwest at between three and seven knots .  The other 
conditions included:  50 km visibility, FEW cloud21 at 4,500 feet  and 5 ,500 feet,  temperature 
about 19º Celsius  and pressure varying between  1,018 and 1 ,020 hectopascals.  At 1413 a n 
updated  report  record ed an increase in the wind at Queenstown airport to southwest ( 220º 
magnetic ) at 15 knots, maximum 20 knots.  The other parameters remained  similar .   
3.5.4.  The aerodrome meteorological conditions  recorded  automatically every 30 minutes show ed 
that between 1230 and 1330 the wind was from the southwest at between 9 and 11 knots.  
The report issued at 1400 recorded the wind varying  between  southwest and west at 14 
knots.  Subsequent reports record ed the wind be ing steady from the southwest at between 7 
and 10 knots.  
3.5.5.  Another s ource of accurate wind data for the Queenstown area was the Meteorological 
Service's recordings taken every minute at its aerodrome  site.  The data showed that during 
the afternoon the wind  direction was from the southwest (between about 235 º and 255º 
True) .  Wind strength fluctuated between about 5 and 10 knots , with occasional increases to a 
maximum of 20 knots.  The aerodrome was 21 km from the accident site, approximately  
downwind.  
3.6. Operator  information  
3.6.1.  Over The Top was established in 1986  and was certificated by the CAA to carry out air 
operations under Civil Aviation Rules Part 135, Air Operations - Helicopters and Small 
Aeroplanes.  The previous  safety audit by the CAA had been  undertaken on 15 May 2014 , 
when three minor findings were issued.  The findings related to lapses in documentation 
concerning  management and maintenance  practices , and were soon rectified .  The CAA's risk 
assessment of the operator continued to place it in the lower or lowest risk assessment band 
for this type of operator.  
3.6.2.  At the time of the accident Over  The Top operat ed the Robinson R44 helicopter involved in the 
accident and six turbine -powered Airbus22 helicopters  available for charter operations around 
the Southern Lakes and southw est Fiordland area.  The operator also offered a 'U-Fly 2' 
experience, where a customer could 'fly' the R44 under the supervision of one of its 
instructors.  The operator had three B -category instructor pilots a ble to perform  this work.  
3.6.3.  The company owner held the  following  senior positions within the organisation : 
 CEO 
 responsib ility for 'competency assessment'  
 responsibility for crew training  
 responsibility for flight and ground operation s.

 An external training organisation conducted pilot competency checks , typically alternat ing 
between the  different helicopter  types to help ensure pilots  were competent to  operate each 
type.  
3.6.4.  The operator was the recipient of safety awards  issued by national and international  
organisations, and the CAA .23  Pilots were encouraged by the operator to gain recognition  of 
their flying and safety efforts .  On 3 May 2012 the instructor had received  a New Zealand 
Helicopter Association Silver Safety Award, rec ognising "more than 10 years'  continuous 
service without accident  to self, passengers or crew ".  
3.7. Additional information  
Robinson helicopters  
3.7.1.  The R44 is a four -seat development of the R22, and was first delivered in 1993.  The R44 and 
R22, and the later R66, share a common two -bladed teetering24 rotor system unique to 
Robinson.  In 2002 the R44 Raven II version was introduced and offered hydraulically assisted 
controls, a more powerful engine and improved main rotor blades.  This resulted in an 
increase in performance and maximum allowable weight.  More than  5,000 R44 helicopters 
have been delivered, making it one of the most common helicopters currently in use in the 
world.25  At the end of 2014, according to CAA data, 40% of the helicopter fleet in New 
Zealand comprised  Robinson helicopters, with 144 R22s, 186 R44s and five R66s.   
3.7.2.  During the 1980s t he R22  was involved in a disproportionate number of accident s when 
compared with other helicopter types , so the United States Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) and NTSB initiated  several studies regarding the certification and opera tion of the type.  
One of the outcomes of the studies  was the issuing of FAA Special Federal Aviation Regulation 
(SFAR) 73 in 1995 , which set pilot experience and training requirements for the R22.  The 
requirements were extended to include the R44 because  of similar concerns.  However, in 
New Zealand SFAR 73 was applicable to the R22 only.  See Commission  reports 11 -003 and 
13-005 for further information on SFAR  73 (TAIC 2011 and TAIC 2013 a). 
3.7.3.  The minimum experience and training requirements, plus the fitment of an engine speed 
governor as standard equipment, also in 1995, resulted in a decrease in the accident rate.  
Rotor head design    
3.7.4.  The basic teetering rotor head design26 has been  used on a number of  two-bladed main rotor 
systems  - for example t he B ell 47 , developed in 1946 , and the Bell UH -1 Iroquois (204/205) , 
developed in 1956, which were  both successful helicopters .27  Both types also incorporate a 
stabiliser bar positioned at 90º to the main rotor blades to increase main rotor stability .  In the 
1970s a significant number of helicopter accidents were being attributed to mast bumping , 
where the main rotor teete rs excessively and the hub strikes  the mast. If the bumping were 
sufficiently violent, the damaged mast could fail totally and the main roto r separate.  
Excessive teetering , possibly compounded by pilot input to the controls, could  place excessive 
loads on the pitch change links that control led blade angle.  Once the pitch change links 
failed, the blades were  free to rotate and be driven into the fuselage of the helicopter s.  Either 
scenario usually had disastrous consequences.    
 
 
                                                        
23 Organisations included the New Zealand Helicopter Association and the Helicopter Association 
International . 
24 Teetering is the see -saw movement of a two -blade d rotor about the teeter bolt or centrally  mounted rotor 
hub. 
25 Some 4,600 R22s of various models have been manufactured.  
26 Sometimes called a semi -rigid rotor head because it is rigid in the plane of rotation, but can still flap.  
27 Some 5,600 Bell 47 and 16,000 Bell UH -1 helicopters were produced.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 3.7.5.  Three main factors were identified as leading to mast bumping:  
 low-G28 
 centre of gravity outside limits  
 abrupt and excessive control  inputs.  
3.7.6.  Military flight manuals were amended to prohibit low-G manoeuvres and flight into severe or 
extreme turbulence.29 The equivalent manuals for the civil versions of the UH -1 Iroquois, the 
Bell 205, were briefer and contained no similar restrictions.30    
3.7.7.  The Robinson rotor head design is unique in that it incorporates coning or flapping hinges31 as 
well as a teeter hinge (see Figure 7).  The teeter hinge allows the rotor system to tilt in a 
particular direction, thus inclining the rotor thrust in that d irection.  The coning hinge allows 
individual blades to flap up and down.  Flapping32 is a normal function of flight and is the 
result of the lift of a blade changing in response to changes in airspeed and angle of attack as 
the blades rotate.  It is also c ommon during start -up and shutdown in windy conditions , where 
the slow rotation of the blades provide s insufficient centrifugal force and stability to maintain 
the blades in the same plane of rotation.  Static or teeter stops are used to control excessive 
teeter and prevent damage to the mast during this time.    
3.7.8.  The Robinson main rotor blades are regarded as being lightweight, low -inertia blades when 
compared with the heavier blades found on other  helicopters.  While the low -inertia blades 
offered advantages, one disadvantage was the potential rapid decay in rotor RPM , perhaps in 
response to poor throttle control , overpitching  of the rotor blades  or engine failure and slow 
entry to autorotation.  To help address this concern, Robinson provided an automatic 
carburettor heat control and a more powerful engine, modified the main rotor blades and 
installed an electronic fuel control governor to help control engine and main rotor speed . 
                                                        
28 G, sometimes identified as 'g', is the acceleration due to gravity.  Low-G is a net force less than the force of 
gravity.  When zero the object is described as weightless . 
29 United Sta tes Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force flight manuals for the UH -1 Iroquois included the 
figure of 0.5g  as the minimum load factor.  
30 According to Bell Helicopters, the relevant military organisation was the airworthiness authority for its 
helicopters, n ot the civil regulator.  The restrictions reflected the types of operation being undertaken.  
31 Robinson uses the term coning hinge.  
32 Flapping is the vertical movement of a blade about a hinge (coning bolt) perpendicular to the blade span .

Mast bumping  
3.7.9.  Mast bumping is th e result of extreme teetering .  Extreme teetering  is when the main rotor, 
often described as the disc  because of the shape it describes , diverges significantly from the 
normal plane of rotation.33  This can occur when either the disc or the fuselage moves 
excessively relative to each other.  There are several factors that can , in combination  and in 
some cases singularly, initiate  excessive teetering  and mast bumping .  These are:  
 low-G 
 turbulence  
 large, abrupt control movements by the pilot 
 low main rotor speed or  RPM . 
  Low -G 
3.7.10.  Low-G flight is a situation when the occupants feel a sensation of reduced weight.  It can be 
induced by a pilot moving the cyclic control  stick  forward.  In a helicopter with a teetering rotor 
head, b ecause of the position of the helicopter's centre of gravity and the tail rotor thrust line, 
if the pitch forward is sufficiently strong enough and the tail rotor thrust line moves high enough, 
a roll to the right can be induced.34  Because of the teetering rotor head design  and the 
gyroscopic stability of the main rotor , the disc attitude will remain stationary or slowly lag behind 
the fuselage roll.  In effect, the pilot will observe the helicopter starting to roll righ t, but the dis c 
may still be about level.  If the pilot applies  left cyclic to counter the apparent roll, the angle 
between the disc and the mast on the left side will be reduced even further - possibly to the 
point where the spindle (see Figure 7)  contacts the mast  (mast bumping) .   
                                                        
33 Often referred  to as main rotor divergence.  See Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB, United Kingdom) 
Bulletin 2/2013, G -CHZN.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 3.7.11.  A higher power setting  will result in more  rotor torque being generated , requiring  more tail rotor 
thrust to balance th e torque  effect.  The refore , the higher the power setting  the greater will be 
the rate of roll.  At a high speed  there is a high power setting and a high tail rotor position .   
3.7.12.  The R44 Pilot's Operating Handbook35 limitations section stated "Low-G cyclic pushovers 
prohibited ".  Immediately following this, a caution36 alerted pilots that low-G condition "can 
result in catastrophic loss of later al control ".  Pilots were instructed that should low-G be 
encountered they were to apply gentle aft cyclic , and should a right roll commence  they should  
apply gentle aft cyclic to reload the disc before applying lateral cyclic to stop the roll.  
3.7.13.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook  Section 10 Safety Tips and Notices contained the following 
tip: 
Never push the cyclic forward to descend or to terminate a pull -up (as you would in 
an [aeroplane] ).  This may produce low -G (near weightless) con dition which can 
result in a main rotor blade striking the cabin.  Always use the collective to initiate a 
descent.  
A safety notice also discussed low-G and stated that pilots should never demonstrate or 
experiment with low-G as even highly experienced tes t pilots had been killed investigating this 
flight condition (see Safety Notice SN -11 in Appendix 4). 
Turbulence  
 
3.7.14.  Turbulence is rated  as light, moderate, severe or extreme , according to the effect on the 
aircraft and its occupants .  Light turbulence is when the aircraft experiences slight erratic 
changes in attitude or altitude , whereas  extreme turbulence  may cause  structural damage.  
The assessment can be subjective .  For example , it would not be unusual for the same 
turbulen t con ditions  to be  described as moderate by the pilot of a light helicopter , but as light 
by the  pilot of a large aeroplane.   
3.7.15.  Turbulence is a known contributor to ma st bumping . A large downward gust will unload the  
rotor disc37, resulting in low-G.  Conversely,  an upward gust  will increase the angle of attack of 
the blades, causing the blades to flap.  Inappropriate or inadvertent pilot inputs or over -
controlling can exacerbate the effects of the turbulence. The P ilot's Operating Handbook  
contained no limitation  for flight in turbulence.  Safety Notice SN-32 warned pilots that the 
improper application of control inputs in turbulence could  increase the likelihood of mast 
bumping.38   
3.7.16.  The notice described the procedures to be followed when encountering turbulence, principally 
to reduce speed.  This had the twin benefit s of lowering the tail rotor thrust line, thereby 
reducing the likelihood of an uncommanded right roll  and, secondly, reducing the tail rotor 
thrust, such that if the heli copter should start to roll right, it would  be at a slower rate.  The 
notice also stated that p ilots should tighten their seat belt s and firmly rest their right forearm s 
on their right legs to prevent unintentional control inputs. The notice noted that the  helicopter 
was more susceptible to turbulence at light weight (see Appendix 4).         
   
  
                                                        
35 The Pilot's Operating Handbook i ncluded the approved flight manual.  This document contained, among 
other things, limitations in the operating of an aircraft and various safety tips and notices.  
36 The Pilot's Operating Handbook used the terms Caution  and Note, with Caution  being defined as 
"Equipment damage, injury, or death can result if procedure or instruction is not followed".  
37 The rotor disc is the area swept by the rotor blades each revolution . 
38 This has since been amended to advise that "Flying in high winds or turbulence should be avoided".  
Final report AO -2015 -002 
<< Page 19 >>
 Large , abrupt control movements  
   
3.7.17.  The R44, like the R22, is very responsive to pilot control inputs.  The cyclic control  stick in 
particular  requires only light forces to achieve the full range of movement.  The hydraulically 
boosted controls also mean that a pilot has little feedback and thus limited feel of what's 
happening to the main rotor . 
3.7.18.  Any large and/ or abrupt movement of the cyclic  stick  will cause the disc to teeter .  Excessive 
movement will  result in  main rotor movement relative to the mast , reducing  the margin 
between the hub and mast  and leading to possible mast bumping.  The Pilot's Operating 
Handbook 's limitations section  and a safety tip both advised pilots to avoid abrupt control 
inputs as these produce d high fatigue loads and could lead to the failure of a critical 
component.   An NTSB  study of R22 accidents  involving  loss of main rotor control found that 
"large, abrupt control inputs can lead  directly to mast bumping… " (NTSB 1996) . 
Low main rotor RPM  
  
3.7.19.  The coning angle39 of the disc is the result of the interaction between the lift being generated 
by the blades and the centrifugal force from their rotation.  With the helicopter on the ground 
at normal operating RPM  and with no collective pitch applied, the disc will be flat.  In hover the 
blades will be coned upwards in response to the increase in lift being generated .  Were the 
RPM  to decrease  while holding the same hover position , the blades w ould cone upwards 
because of the reduced centrifugal forces.  A secondary effect of the reduced RPM  is reduced 
lift. The collective lever40 would t herefore need to be  raise d to maintain the same amount of 
lift.  Th e resulting increase  in blade pitch angle i ncreases the  drag on the rotor blades and, if 
not countered, will reduce rotor RPM  even further.  
3.7.20.  If the situation described above continues, the blades will stall - lift will suddenly reduce.  The 
blades will then flap down .  In forward flight the stall will not be symmetrical and the retreating 
blade will stall first.41  This situation will lead to main rotor divergence , with the stalled 
retreating blade potentially striking the mast and/or the airframe.   
3.7.21.  A Pilot's Operating Handbook  safety tip state d: "Never allow rotor RPM to become dangerously 
low.  Most hard landings will be survivable as long as the rotor is not allowed to stall ".  The 
Pilot's Operating Handbook  also contained two safety notices, SN -10 and SN -24, relating to 
low rotor RPM  and fatal accidents (see Appendix 4).  
  
                                                        
39 The coning angle is the angle formed between the span -wise length of the main rotor blades and their tip 
path plane .  The angle varies according to the resultant of the centrifugal force due to RPM and the lift that is 
demanded . 
40 The collec tive lever is the control that changes the pitch angle of the main rotor blades  by the same 
amount and at the same time, which changes the total rotor thrust, usually to effect a climb or descent . 
41 Because of the relative airspeed over the blades, to generate the same amount of lift the retreating blade 
will be at a higher pitch angle than the advancing blade.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The Commission determine d that it was virtually certain the helicopter experienced a mast 
bump event, which resulted in the main rotor blades striking the fuselage .  Thereafter the 
helicopter broke up in flight.  
4.1.2.  The Commission has not been able to establish conclusively what initiated or contributed to 
the mast bump.  The uncertainty around the circumstances of this accident is not unique.  The 
nature of mast bump accidents is th at they are usually fatal, leaving  no one to explain what 
was happening at the time.  In -flight break -ups are destructive, making it difficult to determine 
with certainty whether a mechanical failure of some kind could have initiated the mast bump.  
4.1.3.  There h ave been many other fatal mast bump accidents involving Robinson helicopters in New 
Zealand and around the world  that have gone largely unexplained .  It is difficult to identify  the 
lessons from an accident and make meaning ful recommendations to prevent si milar 
accidents if the underlying causes cannot be determined.  This is a serious safety issue that  
the industry , including pilots, operators, the manufacturer and the regulator,  will need to 
address . 
4.1.4.  A remedy for the lack of reliable data concerning specific accidents is to record flight data and 
cockpit video.  At present International Civil Aviation Organi sation (ICAO ) standards do not 
require flight data recorders to be installed in small and medium  helicopters.  However, 
lightweight and affordable recorders are available and are installed as standard equipment in 
some helicopters.  In addition, technical means are available for detecting, and therefore 
recording, the positions of flight and engine c ontrols on helicopter types that have previously 
been unsuited for the collection of digital data.  
4.1.5.  The Commission has therefore made a recommendation to the Secretary for Transport, and 
given notice of that recommendation to the Director of the CAA, to pro mote through the 
appropriate  ICAO forum the need for cockpit video recorders and/or other forms of data 
capture in the cockpit s of certain classes of helicopter to address this safety issue.  
4.1.6.  Since 1996 the Commission and the CAA have collectively investiga ted 12 accidents or 
incidents involving R22, R44 and R66 helicopters where mast bumping occurred.  Some 
common themes were identified  (refer to Appendix 1 for details) . 
4.1.7.  In six of the 12 accidents  the helicopter s had very likely encountered turbulence.  In cases 
where  turbulence had not been severe, high speed, high engine power and/or over -controlling 
by the pilot s were considered to be possible contributing factors .  Eight of the accidents 
occurred in mountainous or hilly terrain.  Five of the occurrences involved pilot training of 
some form.  Six occurred while the helicopter s were  in transit between two locations , and a 
seventh was during cross -country navigation training.  Of the accidents where the main rotor 
blade s struck the helicopter s, five were to the fuselage  and five to the tail boom . The 
remaining two were  mast bump incidents where  the main rotor blade s did not  strike  the 
helicopter s. 
4.1.8.  On 9 March 2013 a Robinson R66 helicopter suffered a mast bump and in -flight break -up in 
the Kaweka  Ranges.  (See Commission report AO -2013 -003.)  As a result of that inquiry , on 25 
February 2016 the Commission recommended to the Administrator, Federal Aviation 
Administration of the United States that he "reinstate research into the dynamic behaviour of  
two-bladed, teetering, underslung rotor systems, taking full advantage of available technology, 
with the aim of achieving the original goal of NTSB recommendation A -96-12.  (005/16)" .    
4.1.9.  The following analysis discusses  in more detail what happened .  Ther e are generally four 
factors  that, usually in combination,  can potentially lead to mast bumping.  They are:  
 low-G 
 turbulence  
Final report AO -2015 -002 
<< Page 21 >>
  large, abrupt control movements by the pilot 
 low main rotor speed or RPM .  
Each of these has been considered  in relation to the cir cumstances of this accident.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The crushing of the teeter stops found on the rotor head was a clear indication  of a mast 
bump.  Other rotor head damage found included broken pitch change links, a bent rotor shaft 
and scoring on the inside of the hub from excessive movement of the spindle tusks.  This 
damage was a typical signature of a significant mast bump.  
4.2.2.  A significant mast bump event often result s in the main rotor blades striking the fuselage .  In 
this case one of the main rotor blades (the red blade) struck  the cabin area of the fuselage  
twice .  The first strike was through the top left side of the cabin.  The second strike, as little as 
0.15 seconds after the first42, hit the upper instrument console and left handle of the cyclic 
control  stick .  The blade then swung under the fuselage to strike the rear of the left skid.  The 
tip bent around the skid and separated to the right of the flight path (see Figure 8).  The main 
fuel tank located on th e left side was dislodged early in the sequence and also ejected  out to 
the right of the flight path.  
   
 
Figure 8 
Main rotor blade strike on rear of left skid  
4.2.3.  The spread of the wreckage on the ground was typical of an in -flight break -up initiated by a 
mast bump and the main rotor blades striking the fuselage . 
4.2.4.  It is clear that mast bumping in itiated the in-flight break -up of the helicopt er.  What is not so 
clear is what caused the mast bump.  Several possibilities were examined.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 Engine or transmission failure  
4.2.5.  An engine or transmission failure was unlikely to ha ve contributed to this accident.   A normal 
pilot response to this type of failure would be to enter the helicopter into autorotation by 
lowering the collective  lever , thus avoiding low rotor RPM  (one of the known causes of mast 
bumping) .  The frequent p ractice of an  autorotation  after a s imulated engine failure  forms part 
of the helicopter pilot training syllabus.  The instructor was an experienced helicopter pilot.  It 
would therefore have been  unlikely for him to allow an engine or transmission failure to result 
in a low rotor RPM, even if the student was flying at the time.  
4.2.6.  In support of this hypothesis , the teardown examination of the engine revealed no faults.  The 
'trapped' engine readings and the scoring marks on the engine cooling fan and adjacent areas 
confirm ed that the engine had been  operating at the time of the in -flight break -up.  It could 
not, however , be established how much power the engine was delivering at the time.  
4.2.7.  The restricted fuel flow to the #5 nozzle and cylinder was not significant and at worst would 
have caused only minor rough running of the engine, which may not have even been 
notice able to the pilots.  There would have been ample power available to fly the helicopter 
back to Queenstown.  It would be unusual for a r ough -running  engine  alone  to result in 
reduced main rotor RPM . 
4.2.8.  The fuel control unit was examined as part of the investigation and  determined to have been 
functioning correctly at the time of the accident.  It was considered very unlikely to have 
contributed to the accident for a number of reasons.  Firstly, an examination of the unit found 
no fault.  Secondly, the engine was still operating at the time of impact.  And thirdly, a fuel 
control unit failure, even to f ull flow, should have been easily handled by the instructor  and at 
worst resulted in a forced landing  - not an in -flight break -up.    
4.2.9.  A drive belt or clutch failure was unlikely to have contributed to the accident.  Power is 
transmitted from the engine to the rotor drive system through vee -belts and a clutch 
arrangement.   One of the two V -belts was partially split but both  were otherwise intact, with no 
evidence of their having rolled off their pulley s or excessive slippage.  The longitudinal split in 
one o f the drive belts matched rubber transfer marks on an adjacent section of the engine 
frame , making it  virtually certain that the split occurred when the helicopter broke apart and 
caused the engine frame to make contact with the drive belt.  
4.2.10.  The clutch lock ed and free -wheeled normally and the transmission rotated freely.   The internal 
damage found in the clutch assembly was consistent with the engine continuing to try to drive 
the transmission and main rotor when the red blade struck the fuselage.  
4.2.11.  When a pil ot engages the clutch switch , an electric actuator raises the upper drive sheave to 
tension the belts that drive the main and tail rotors.  When the belts are properly tensioned, 
the actuator automatically switches off.  
4.2.12.  The hot stretch found in the 'clutch caution light' filament was evidence that the light was 
illuminated when the control panel was disrupted.  However, this would not have been  
unusual because the clutch caution light illuminates whenever the actuator aut omatically 
energises to re -tension the belts in flight, and stays on until the belts are properly tensioned.  
For this reason, "occasional illumination of the clutch light during flight is not uncommon " 
(Pilot Operating Handbook).  Additionally, any relati ve movement between an engine and the 
transmission during a break -up sequence is likely to affect  momentarily the tension of the 
drive belts, causing the actuator to energise and the caution light to illuminate.   
4.2.13.  Fuel starvation or contamination was unlik ely to have been a factor in the accident.  The main 
fuel tank had contained fuel and, based on the calculated fuel load at the start of the flight, 
there should have been sufficient fuel for a further two hours of flying.  The main fuel filter  
contained f uel and had no  obvious contaminants.  The fuel lines from the tank to the engine 
were free of any obstruction and the engine was operating at the start of  the break -up 
sequence .  The aerodrome fuel supply was tested for quality and the fuel found to have met 
the required quality . 
Final report AO -2015 -002 
<< Page 23 >>
 Component failure  
4.2.14.  The fracture of the red main rotor blade was close to the change in chord , which was where a 
fatigue failure had occurred the previous month on another R44 helicopter .43  However , the 
fractures where both the blue and red main rotor blades separated from the helicopter were  
confirmed by metallurgical examinations to be the result of overload failure , not fatigue  failure.   
That is , they were torn from the helicopter by the forces in volved during the in -flight break -up 
or from impact with trees and the ground.   The two near -90º downward bend s of the blade 
were examined and determined to be the result of overload  resulting  from  the initial rotor 
divergence and mast bump.   
4.2.15.  An examinatio n of the main rotor and tail rotor drives also found no pre -existing fault s.  All 
other d amage to the helicopter can reasonably be attributed to the sequence of in -flight break -
up and impact with the surrounding terrain .  Staff from the Ins titute of Enviro nment al Science 
and Research (E SR) examined both main rotor blades for evidence of a bird strike.  None was 
found .   
4.3. Mast bumping  
4.3.1.  As mentioned above , low-G, turbulence , large, abrupt control movements by a pilot , and low 
main rotor speed or RPM  are all factors or conditions known to contribute to mast bumping.   
Some o f these factors  can be  interrelated.  A helicopter can momentarily enter low-G due to 
turbulence.  Pilots can cause low-G by their control input alone.  A pilot's  incorrect flight c ontrol 
response to a helicopter being buffeted by turbulence can exacerbate rather than alleviate a 
low-G situation, and thus create a mast bump situation that otherwise might not have 
occurred.  
4.3.2.  In Robinson 's opinion, turbulence alone does not cause mast b umping, but rather it is a pilot's 
control input in response to turbulence that creates the problem.  However, this hypothesis 
has not been tested.  
4.3.3.  Another  key factor is the speed of the helicopter at the time.  An increase in the  spee d or 
power setting will increase the onset of the event and reduce  the time for the pilot to make the 
correct response  (paragraph 3.7.11) . 
Low rotor RPM  
4.3.4.  Low rotor RPM was unlikely to have been a factor in this accident .  As mentioned above there 
is no evidence that supports any major issue with the engine or transmission that could have 
resulted in a significant drop in main rotor RPM.  
4.3.5.  Low rotor RPM can be induced by pilots when helicopter s are  engaged in tight manoeuvres, 
such as stock mustering and hunting activities.  Howe ver, in this case the helicopter was as 
likely as not being flown  directly down the valley on its return  to Queenstown  in order for the 
instructor to make his next appointment.  
4.3.6.  A third argument is provided by Robinson , which  says, "Experience has generally  been that 
low-G mast bumping usually results in the rotor blade or blades contacting the cabin, and low 
RPM rotor stall usually results in the rotor blade or blades contacting the tail  cone [tail boom].  
There are exceptions to this… ".  In this case the m ain rotor blades contacted the cabin.  
4.3.7.  A fourth  and more definitive argument is that low main rotor RPM events result in both main 
rotor blades coning upwards, which usually results in a similar creasing of the upper blade 
surface on both main rotor blades.  There was no evidence of this signature damage on the 
two main rotor blades recovered from the accident site.  
Turbulence  
4.3.8.  The wind conditions were reported by witnesses on the ground as calm or light.  However, 
what was experienced by the witnesses on the ground may not have been the same as those 
                                                        
43 This occurrence is still being investigated by the Commission (Inquiry AO -2015 -003).  
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final report AO -2015 -002 at 1,000 feet above the valley floor and several kilometres away.  Similarly, the conditions that  
the people in the searching helicopters expe rienced may not have been the same as the 
conditions an hour or more earlier.  
4.3.9.  The New Zealand Meteorological Service data recorded at Queenstown aerodrome was not an 
exact representation of the conditions in the valley at the time.  However, what the data does 
show is that while the wind direction remained steady, there were constant variations in the 
strength of the wind.  The 15 -20 knots recorded at Queenstown could have been enough to 
generate light turbulence .  Mountainous terrain can cause wide variati ons in turbulence from 
one area to the next .  Therefore it was about as likely as not that  there was light or even 
moderate  turbulence in the valley at times.  
4.3.10.  The weather conditions were certainly suitable for the flight.  If turbulence were  a factor, whic h 
of the  two pilots  was flying at the time could be relevant.  The instructor was an experienced 
helicopter pilot with 2 ,145 hours on Robinson helicopters, including 950 hours on the R44 
type.  None of the scenarios presented so far should have caused him any concern.  
4.3.11.  There is some evidence to suggest that the student was controlling the helicopter at the time  
of the accident .  The helicopter was fitted with dual controls, which include d an extension see -
saw handle arrangement on top of the main cyclic control stick.  The pilot flying pulls the 
extension handle down to a comfortable position in order to fly the helicopter.  The other end 
of this extension is consequently in a raised position.  
4.3.12.  The angle at which the main rotor blade entered  the cabin and struck the cyclic control  stick  
suggest ed that the cyclic extension handle was angled down to the right as it would have been  
had the student been flying.  While not conclusive , it is about as likely as not that the student 
was flying at the time.  
Pilot-induced low-G 
4.3.13.  Low-G can be induced by pilot s, perhaps  inadvertent ly when transitioning from a climb to level 
or descending flight , or deliberately  - for example if an instructor is demonstrat ing to a 
student the me thod for recovering from a low -G condition .   
4.3.14.  In-flight demonstration s of low -G are prohibited for Robinson helicopters, yet there is strong 
evidence that in New Zealand some  instructors are demonstrating  to students  the onset of the 
characteristic right roll that will occur if a helicopter enters  a low -G situation.  This evidence 
comes from an expert conference the Commission hosted in relation to another accident 
involving a Robinson helicopter, and also from New Zealand industry training forums hosted 
by Robinson.  
4.3.15.  There is no evidence to suggest  that such a demonstration was being made at the time of this 
accident.  However, it is known that the  instructor had demonstrate d the procedure to at least 
one student in the past.  
4.3.16.  Eight former students of the instructor and several fe llow pilots were que stioned about his 
flying and whether  he had performed low-G demonstration s.  Only one student said that the 
instructor had demonstrated the lead -up to low -G with the helicopter becoming "light", but 
they said that this stopped before it started to roll.  All the students and pilots agreed that the 
instructor had been  a very thorough and professional instructor and pilot, and had  had a good 
empathy with his students.  They said he had not and would not  have  undertake n any random 
manoeuvre that would have knowi ngly endanger ed the helicopter.  
4.3.17.  It would have been  unusual for the instructor to be demonstrating to this student the effect of 
entering low -G at his stage of learning, with only 10 hours ' flying logged.  Additionally , the 
circumstances discussed above indicate that the practical part of the instruction flight was 
essentially over, with the helicopter simply returning to base  within an expected timeframe .  It 
is therefore very unlikely that the instructor was demonstra ting low -G.

 Helicopter speed/power setting  
4.3.18.  The speed of the helicopter and how it was being manoeuvred at the time of the accident is 
important for understanding the possible factors that contribute d to the mast bumping.   
4.3.19.  The helicopter was fitted with a TracPlus satellite tracking system.  The system transmitted a 
message via satellite every two minutes to the operator's base, where it was displayed and 
recorded.  If satellite connectivity was momentarily lost for some reason , the unit would 
continue trying to establish a link.  Once the link was re -established, updated data would be 
transmitted.  
4.3.20.  Each transmission included the time the message had been  sent and received by the satellite  
and the helicopter's position, groundspeed and altitude at that point in time.  The approximate 
track the aircraft was flying at this time was also calculated and presented in degrees True.  
4.3.21.  The system calculated the straight -line speed and direction at the time of  transmission.  Any 
deviation or manoeuvres that took place between the transmissions  or any changes in speed 
could not be shown .  
4.3.22.  A review of the tracking data showed that, with a few exceptions, information was being 
transmitted about every two mi nutes for the duration of the flight.  During the flight into the 
operating area the groundspeed ranged between 80 and 100 knots, with a maximum of 108 
knots.  While in the Lochy River valley the helicopter was performing semi -regular orbits, and 
occasiona lly becoming stationary as if in hover.   This was consistent with the  observations of 
the witnesses on the ground.  
4.3.23.  Before starting to leave the valley the helicopter likely flew a left orbit , followed by a nearly 
180º turn before heading down the valley (s ee Figure 9).  The straight -line distance from the 
last data report made at 1340:30 to the start of the wreckage field was two nautical miles 
(3.73 km).  
 
Figure 9 
Track presentation and accident location44 
4.3.24.  The tracking data shows that, at the last recorded position, the pilot had climbed  the 
helicopter to a sufficient height above the terrain to be able to enter autorotation and select

 Final report AO -2015 -002 the most suitable area to land had a problem been encountered .45  It also showed the 
helicopter  was then flying at a moderate groundspeed of  102 knots.  The almost calm wind 
conditions in the area meant the airspeed would have been similar to  the groundspeed .  At 
this speed  it would have taken about one minute and 10 seconds to travel from the last 
recorded  position to overhead the accident site.  However, the precise timing of the accident is 
not known, so the track data can tell us nothing other than  that the helicopter was proceeding 
back towards Queenstown and had been travelling at a speed of 102 k nots in the two minutes 
before the accident .   
4.3.25.  The instructor would have still been under the impression that he needed to return to 
Queenstown by 1400  for his next scheduled flight .  At a groundspeed of 102 knots the 
helicopter would have reached the aero drome at about 1350.  It is likely therefore that the 
helicopter was  flying directly back to Queenstown  rather than conducting further flight training 
manoeuvres or deviating for any other reason . 
4.3.26.  As mentioned above , the higher the speed, the greater  is the risk of encountering a low-G 
situation for whatever reason, and the pilot has less opportunity to recognise and respond 
appropriately to the situation.  Robinson has recognised this risk and recommended that 
speed be reduced to below 70 knots if turbu lence is encountered.  
4.3.27.  Flying at 100 knots or more  and encountering a pocket of unexpected turbulence while under 
the control of a low -flying -time student pilot is a reasonably high-risk situation.  A helicopter 
could  feasibly  enter a low-G condition and su ffer mast bumping in less than one second.  An 
instructor would be  unlikely to have time to intervene.  
Training and awareness  
4.3.28.  Accidents involving ma st bumping  occur worldwide and are not unique to New Zealand .  Both 
New Zealand and Australia were considered by R obinson  to have high er rates of these types 
of accident than  other countries .  Discussions with ATSB staff identified some significant 
differences in the accident signatures.  Most of the Australian accidents had involved low rotor 
RPM  or ex cessive control input .  These were often related to intense manoeuvring of the 
helicopter s close to the ground, for example during cattle mustering.  The New Zealand 
accidents were more commonly related to turbulence and low-G, often resulting in the mast s 
separating , an event  rarely seen in Australia.   
4.3.29.  About 60% of New Zealand 's terrain is designated as mountainous46, the rest is mostly 
undulating and hilly.  Turbulence generated by the wind moving over rough terrain is therefore 
a common feature of flying  around New Zealand at low levels .  Pilots are trained to be aware 
of turbulence, recognise its potential affects and avoid or mitigate them where possible.  
However, by its very nature the presence or intensity of turbulence cannot always be 
predicted.   Refer paragraph 3.5.1.  
4.3.30.  The Pilot's Operating Handbooks for each of Robinson's t hree  helicopter  models contained the 
same safety tips and notices relating to low-G, low rotor RPM  and turbulence .  The introduction 
of SFAR 73 with its pilot experience and trai ning requirements helped to reduce the incidence 
of low-G and low RPM accidents around the world , including in countries with mountainous 
terrain  similar  to New Zealand's .  The same reduction was not evident in New Zealand, 
perhaps due in part to the t errain.  Operators and pilots therefore need to be aware that there 
is a minimal margin for safety when operating in mountainous regions, at light weight, at high 
speed and/or at high power  and in turbulent conditions . 
4.3.31.  Another possible factor was how SFAR 73 was being implemented, including different 
minimum experience requirements and safety awareness training.  A discussion involving  
senior instructors on Robinson helicopters, CAA representatives and Commission 
                                                        
45 The last two data points showed that the helicopter had been climbed at an average rate of about 350 feet 
per minute.

Final report AO -2015 -002 
<< Page 27 >>
 investi gators47 found that the content, understanding and delivery of the Robinson safety 
awareness training varied between instructors in New Zealand  (see Commission reports 11 -
003 and AO -2013 -005, TAIC 2011, 2013b ).  A recommendation to the New Zealand Director 
of Civil Aviation was made on the subject.48  The safety actions section of this report gives an 
update on progress.  
4.3.32.  Robinson has expressed a view that New Zealand instructors who attempt to demonstrate 
low-G could be one reason for the high rate of mast bu mp accidents in New Zealand involving 
Robinson helicopters.  The rationale for its view is that a demonstration of low -G does not 
replicate the true situation and could engender a false sense of security  in the pilot  about  their 
ability to recover from a l ow-G situation.  Pilots may believe that it is easy to recover from a 
low-G situation, when in fact, if it happens, the roll is very rapid, leaving the pilot (no matter 
how experienced) virtually no time to react before a mast bump occurs.  A severe mast b ump 
is usually fatal.  
4.4. Emergency  locato r transmitter (ELT)  
4.4.1.  Although this accident was not survivable, the non -performance of the ELT is of interest.  The 
ELT is fitted to guide search and rescue to an accident site in a timely manner.  For any case  
where the occupants survive  the accident , the performance of the ELT could mean the 
difference between survival and not. 
4.4.2.  In this case the force of the accident was sufficient to activate the ELT but also to tear it from 
its mount, thereby disconnecting it from its external aerial.  The internal aerial operated as 
intended, but the weaker signal was unable to be detected by the geostationary satellite 
positioned to the north of New Zealand.  This was likely the result of a combination of the 
satellite's low angle, the mountainous terrain and bush cover.  A low -Earth -orbit satellite did 
detect a signal message from the ELT approximately one hour and 35 minutes after the 
accident.  With no GPS (global positioning  system) data, a second satellite pass would have 
been required to provide a more accurate position.  The ELT also activated a secondary 
signal49 that was heard by a searching helicopter, but the signal was faint and too weak to 
provide a homing signal.  
4.4.3.  The ELT was found to have made 192 burst transmissions between activating and being 
turned off by rescue personnel.  A burst occurred every 50 seconds, confirming that the ELT 
was active for two hours and 43  minutes, plus or minus a minute.  Because the exact  time for 
which  the ELT was switched off was not known, the time of the accident could not be refined 
any more than that derived from the helicopter's tracking system.  
4.4.4.  The Commission has previously commented on the performance of ELTs and made safety 
recom mendations to the C AA on the need to improve the performance of ELTs and promote 
the use of other tracking technologies (TAIC, 2011).  The Commission has also made 
comment on technologies to locate vessels and rail vehicles.  This accident reinforces  those  
still-active recommendations.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 5. Findings  
5.1. The helicopter suffered a mast bumping event that resulted in a main rotor blade contacting 
the cabin area and initiated an in -flight break -up. 
5.2. An examination of the wreckage revealed no pre -existing defect s or mechanical failure s that 
would have resulted in mast bumping.  However, the damage to the helicopter meant that 
some kind of mechanical issue contributing to the accident could not be fully excluded.  
5.3. The weather was generally calm and suitable for the training flight .  There were  about as likely  
as not  to have been pockets of light to moderate turbulence in the area, but this alone should 
not have resulted in significant mast bumping.  
5.4. The airspeed of the helicopter as it flew down the valley returning t o Queenstown  was as likely 
as not at least 102 knots when the accident occurred . 
5.5. The student was about as likely as not to have been flying the helicopter when the mast 
bumping occurred.  
5.6. The cause of the mast bumping event that initiated the in -flight brea k-up could not be 
conclusively determined . 
5.7. The causes and circumstances of helicopter mast bumping accidents are unlikely to be fully 
understood until a means of recording cockpit imagery  and/or other data is made available.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. The CAA advised that i n resp onse to previous Commission recommendations, several reviews 
were conducted between March 2014 and March 2015.50  The reviews included:  
(a) an examination of existing requirement s in New Zealand, the USA and Australia  
(b) an examination of current Robinson accident  data  
(c) an examination of current Robinson safety awareness training in New Zealand and the 
USA 
(d) meetings with the Commission , Robinson, the FAA, experienced flight examiners and 
instructors, and the New Zealand Helicopter Association.  
The results of the revi ews are included in a Robinson Helicopter Fleet Consultation Document,  
and were published on the CAA's website: 
https://www.caa.govt.nz/pilots/robinson_helicopter_safety.html .  The document's conclusions 
and proposed actions are listed in Appendix 2. 
On 6 November 2015 the CAA announced that the District Court  at Wellington  had given 
approval for the Director  of Civil Aviation  to introduc e special conditions for pilots of R22 and  
R44 helicopters , with effect from 1 July 2016 .  This action will bring New Zealand into line with 
FAA requirements and will "improve the level and consistency of training delivered by the 
aviation industry" .  Key elements of the training include  that: 
 a new syllabus of R22/R44 'ground ' and 'in-flight training ' is prescribed  
 it will be completed by CAA certified 119 and 141 organisations or operators that have  
 approved Robinson safety course s 
 it will be delivered by suitably approved and qualified A or B c ategory  instructors  
 a general aviation examiner with Robinson safety awareness privileges must approve  
  the A and B cat egory  instructors delivering the awareness training  
 the training will be required when new pilots are type -rated  
 ongoing refresher training will be required every 24 months  
 the amount of dual instruction a student requires before flying solo on the R22 and 
 R44 has been lifted to 20 ho urs 
 CAA recognises the existing Robinson factory safety course . 
The full list of conditions approved by the Court is also available at 
https://www.caa.govt.nz/pilots/robinson_conditions.pdf .  An Advisory Circular was also to be 
released in early 2016.

 Final report AO -2015 -002 6.3. In February 2016 Robinson amended Safety Notice SN -32 by inserting an introductory 
sentence that had been deleted in May 2013.  The sentence stated that: "Flying in high winds 
or turbulence should be avoided."  The amendment also advised pilots to "reduce speed" 
when flying solo or lightly loaded.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to  the Secretary for Transport , with 
notice of these recommendations given to the Director of Civil Aviation.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation  
7.3. The Commission has not been able to establish conclusively what initiated or contributed to 
the mast bump event.  The uncertainty around the circumstances of this accident are not 
unique.  The nature of mast bump accidents is that they are usually fatal, leaving no one to 
explain what was happening at the time.  In -flight break -ups are destructive, making it difficult 
to determine with certainty whether mechanical failure s of some kind could have initiated the 
mast bump s. 
There have been many other fatal mast bump accidents involving Robinson helicopters in New 
Zealand and around the world that have gone largely unexplained.  It is difficult to identify the 
lessons from an accident and make meaning ful recommendations to prevent similar 
accidents if the underlying causes cannot be determined.  This is a serious safety issue that 
the industry will need to address.  
A remedy for the lack of reliable data concerning specific accidents is to record flight data and 
cockpit video.  At present ICAO standards do not require flight data recorders to be installed in 
small and medium helicopters.  However, lightwei ght and affordable recorders are available 
and are installed as standard equipment in some helicopters.  In addition, technical means 
are available for detecting, and therefore recording, the positions of flight and engine controls 
on helicopter types that  have previously been unsuited for the collection of digital data.  
7.3.1.  On 27 July 2016  the Commission recommended to the Secretary for Transport that he 
promote , through the appropriate ICAO forum, the need for cockpit video recorders and/or 
other forms of dat a capture in the cockpit s of certain classes of helicopter to address this 
safety issue.  (014/16)  
On 18th August 2016, the Ministry of Transport replied:  
The Ministry considers that such a recommendation is premature as the costs 
and benefits of such a rec ommendation have not been canvassed.  The Ministry 
appreciates that the Commission may have been minded to make such a 
recommendation because of the lack of available data.  The Ministry suggests 
that prior to making a recommendation, some more work should  be undertaken 
to determine the benefits and costs of flight data and video recording in cockpits.  
7.3.2.  On 27 July 2016  the Commission gave notice to the Dir ector of Civil Aviation that a 
recommendation has been made to the Secretary for Transport that he promo te, through the 
appropriate ICAO forum, the need for cockpit video recorders and/or other forms of data 
capture in the cockpit s of certain classes of helicopter to address this safety issue . (015/16)  
On 11 August 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The Director has considered the recommendation and in view of the Secretary for 
Transport's response to the Commission on the matter of cockpit video recorders 
and/or other forms of data capture, the Director is prepared to accept the 
recommendation but w ith a caveat that reflects the Secretary's response, i.e, 
That the Director of Civil Aviation conduct a safety and cost benefit exercise of 
installing flight data and/or cockpit video in certain classes of helicopters.  
 

<< Page 32 >>
 Final report AO -2015 -002 In that regard the Director will ini tiate an issue assessment paper on recording 
devices for certain classes of helicopters. Given the timeframe of such a study is 
likely to be lengthy; the Director cannot provide a completion date at this stage.

 8. Key lesson  identified  
8.1. Helicopter pilots must be fully aware that a condition of low -G (feeling of lightness or 
weightlessness) can result in : a rapid right roll; mast bumping; and in -flight break -up before 
even the most experienced pilot can react and recover the situation.  Pi lots need to fly in a 
manner that avoids low -G conditions rather than allow them  to develop and then expect that 
they can recover from them .

 Appendix 2:  Robinson Helicopter Fleet Consultation Document  results  
The CAA's Robinson Helicopter Fleet Consultation Document  concluded that:  
(a)  There is an absence of rigour in the regulatory oversight of Robinson safety awareness 
training, in that the CAA has no way of conducting oversight of those giving the training, or 
the content of the training that is given;  
(b)  Similarly, there is no mec hanism for ensuring that those providing Robinson safety 
awareness training have been assessed as appropriate for conducting that training;  
(c)  Robinson safety awareness training is necessary for the safe operation of the R22;  
 
(d)  Although the R44 and  R66 are less susceptible than the R22 to the risks focused on in 
Robinson safety awareness training, as a result of the similarities of these aircraft types 
combined with New Zealand accident data it is important that R44 and R66 pilots have a 
clear under standing of these risks and mitigation strategies;  
(e)  However, despite that, there is currently no mechanism for requiring that those flying the 
R44 and R66 have had that training;  
(f)  The 10 -hour minimum flight experience requirement for first solo f light in the R22 does not 
match the 20 hour period required in the SFAR;  
(g)  The current R22 flight manual contains seemingly contradictory statements concerning 
Low G hazard training, which is now prohibited by Robinson; and  
(h)  The flight manual incl udes requirements as to enhanced autorotation which, while 
consistent with the SFAR, are redundant in New Zealand due to our generic helicopter 
training requirements.  
 
The CAA proposed to:  
 
(a)  Require all Robinson safety awareness training to be done un der the authority of either a 
Part 119 or Part 141 certificate;  
(b)  Require the training given to be acceptable to the Director;  
(c) Require those persons delivering Robinson safety awareness training to have been approved 
to do so by a flight examiner;   
(d)  Require Robinson safety awareness training as part of the type rating requirements for the 
R44 and R66;  
(e)  Require Robinson safety awareness training to be completed by all pilots who hold R44 and 
R66 type ratings and who wish to exercise the pri vileges of those type ratings;  
(f)  Increase the minimum flight experience for first solo flight in an R22 from 10 hours to 20

 Final report AO -2015 -002 Appendix 3:    Detailed summary of wreckage examination and testing  
All major components of the helicopter, including flight and engine controls, main rotor and tail rotor 
assembles, landing skids, and fuselage were accounted for at the site and removed fo r further 
examination.  
Flight controls  
 
Dual flight controls had been installed.51  The cyclic control  stick  had broken off near the floor.  Both the 
left and the right cyclic extension  handles  had been broken off, with the left extension handle having an 
impact mark that matched the curve of the leading edge of a main rotor blade.  The collective lever was 
nearly fully down.  However, the distance between the slider slot and the centre of the friction bolt 
corresponded to the collective lever having been ra ised about 15% when the bolt was broken.  The tail 
rotor pedals had broken off at the push -pull tubes below the cabin floor.  
Connectivity of the flight controls through to the main rotor and tail rotor was established.  No evidence 
of pre -impact failure or  problems was found.  
Engine and controls  
 
The mixture control in the cockpit was found in the full rich position, while the mixture control lever on 
the fuel control servo was in a position close to full lean.  The throttle twist grip on the right -seat 
collective lever was close to fully off, while the throttle arm on the fuel control servo was in a position 
beyond full throttle.   These anomalies were considered to be a result of the major disruption to the 
assemblies during the in -flight break -up and impac t with the ground.  
The engine cooling fan displayed scoring around its perimeter and on the inlet cone surfaces.  Similar 
scoring marks were found on the steel tubing adjacent to the upper drive belt sheave and on the 
forward end of the tail cone's bottom surface.  The marks on the steel tubing were parallel to the 
direction of sheave  rotation,  and the marks at the forward end of the tailcone were parallel  to the 
direction of rotation of the engine cooling fan.  The right oil cooler had a series of dents that matched 
the starter ring gear.  
The drive belts were intact, except  one that had a partial split.  There was no evidence that the belts had 
rolled off.  The belt tension actuator was fractured between the anti -rotation scissors.  The distance 
between the anti -rotation scissors was measured to be 0.9 inches.  When tensioned  normally the 
distance is between 0.8 inches and 1.1 inches.  The upper and lower belt tension actuator bearings 
rotated freely.   
The clutch was examined and found to lock and free wheel normally.  The temperature alerting decal on 
the clutch showed no re cord of any excessive stress.  The clutch was examined by a licen sed engineer 
familiar with the R44 and clutch assembly.  The clutch assembly was fitted with a Revision 'H' sprag and 
showed "virtually no sign of 'in service ' wear" .  Tear damage was found o n about one -third of the 
circumference of the inner race .  This m atched marks on the same end of each pall.  The damage was 
in the direction of drive.   The main rotor gearbox rotated freely, despite the main rotor drive shaft being 
bent about 10º.  
The engi ne was removed and taken to an approved aircraft engine overhaul facility and subjected to a 
bulk strip inspection52 under the supervision of a Commission investigator.  Maintenance records 
matched the engine and all applicable airworthiness directives were  found to have been embodied.  
The numbers 3 and 5 cylinders had impact damage, including pieces of wood embedded between the 
cylinders.53  However, all cylinders were able to be removed for examination.  The valve train, piston 
assemblies and spark plugs we re found to be serviceable.  The crank shaft and connecting rods were all 
able to be turned without restriction.  No contamination was found in any of the filters.

 Engine accessories, including the magnetos, fuel control unit and fuel pump were all removed  and 
tested, with no defects found.  The fuel control unit was free of any contamination. The testing of the 
fuel flow divider did identify a 'slightly restricted flow due to tiny metallic particle contamination' for the 
#5 nozzle.  
In summary, the engineer ing company determined that 'no evidence was found of any pre impact defect 
that would have affected the engine's ability to run.  The restriction in the #5 nozzle may have caused 
the engine to run slightly rough with minor power loss'.   The instructor and  student were very unlikely to 
have noticed any difference in helicopter performance.  
Main rotor  
 
Both of the pitch change links, which connect the swashplate to the main rotor blades and control the 
pitch angle of the blades, had failed in overload ,54 likely after a reverse bending motion (see Figure 10).  
Both teeter stops were split horizontally through the middle, and their retention brackets were bent.  
The droop stops and tusks were intact.  There was arc -shaped scoring on both sides of the hub and 
denting above the blade spindles.  The denting was deeper above the blue blade than the red blade.  
The red blade had rotated more than 90º with the pitch horn found sitting above the head.  The drive 
collar/yoke for the upper swashplate had rotated about 90 º anti -clockwise on the shaft.55 
Both main rotor blades had fractured  (see Figure 11) .  Because the f racture of the red blade was near 
the point where another R44 blade had failed, which the CAA suspected had been due to fatigue, the 
Commission had this bla de examined by a metallurgist at the earliest opportunity.  The metallurgist's 
initial assessment was that the blade had failed in overload. Subsequent detailed examination by the 
same laboratory and a further examination by an ATSB metallurgist confirmed this.  The ATSB also 
determined that the failure of the blue blade was also the result of overload and not fatigue.  Both 
blades were examined for signs of any pre -existing delamination or dis -bonding, and none was found.56 
The red blade (serial #3709) had an initial 90º downward bend approximately 0.6 m from the hub.  A 
second 90º twisting downward bend a further 1.9 m along the blade matched where the leading edge 
spar had fractured.  The rest of the blade had fractured a further approximately 30 c entimetres along, 
near the change in chord . There was significant scoring of the blade's lower surface around this area.  
The marks were multi -directional.  The tip of the blade was folded upward about 75º for about 20 
centimetres  behind the leading edge spar.  
The blue blade (serial #3761) had fractured about 1.4 m from the hub. A further approximately 1.5 m of 
the trailing edge doubler had been torn out from the outboard portion of the blade.  The blade was 
mostly straight with an approximately 30º upward bend about 0.6 m from the hub.  
 
                                                        
54 Overload is the common term used to describe the mode of failure where the force sustained exceeded 
the material's physical strength or design load.    
55 The normal direction of rotation of the main rotor is anti -clockwise when viewed from above.  
56 The ea rlier R44 'Dash 2' and 'Dash 5' blades were subject to a Continuing Airworthiness Notice following 
several cases of disbonding near the blade tip.  The Dash 7 blades fitted to ZK -IPY were not subject to the 
same inspection requirement.

 Tail rotor  
 
The intermediate and aft flexible couplings were bent and separated. The gearbox and tail rotor 
assembly had separated, with the gearbox able to be rotated freely.  One tail rotor blade was essentially 
straight while the second had two large bends along its length.  There was no rotational damage found 
on the drive assembly aft of the main transmission.  The drive shaft was bent but intact.  
Fuselage  
 
The airframe and cabin was severely distorted and displaced/bent to the left.  Some components, for 
example the windshield centre frame bow and sections of the doors, had separated from the main 
wreckage.  The instrument console was broken in several places.  There was evidence of a main rotor 
blade having struck the instrument console and the windshield  bow and the cabin roof above the left 
windshield also displayed distortions that approximated to the leading edge of a main rotor blade.   
The two left side doors when reassembled had a fracture line that ran through the upper portion of the 
doors.  Both fuel tanks had separated from the fuselage and had significant deformation.  Both tanks 
had bladders installed and their caps were in place.  The tanks were found empty, however the smell of 
fuel about the wreckage and the heavy ground indent and smell whe re the main tank had landed, 
indic ated both tanks contained some fuel on impact. The main fuel filter was intact and found to 
contain fuel that was consistent with the correct fuel for the helicopter.  The filter screen was clean and 
vent lines free of obs truction.  
The tail boom was straight with two large impact marks, one on the underside near the fuselage 
attachment and a second on the upper surface near the empennage.  The empennage had broken off 
with damage on the horizontal and upper vertical stabil izers.  
The left skid and the toe or front section of the right skid had broken from the landing gear.  The left 
skid was recovered in four sections.  The section located between the two cross -tubes, displayed a 
deformation on the underside that matched the  shape of a main rotor blade leading edge.  
Instruments and readings  
 
The upper instrument console, found near the start of the wreckage trail, had a deformation consistent 
with having been struck by a main rotor blade.  The instruments normally held by the  upper console had 
been dislodged, with the exception of the vertical speed indicator.  Most of the warning lights at the top 
of the console were either broken or missing.  The only light showing evidence of 'hot stretch'57 was the 
clutch light.  None of th e temperature indication stickers on gear boxes and the hydraulic pump showed 
any evidence of excessive heat having been generated in these components.  
The ignition was in the OFF position with the key broken off at the switch face.  The clutch switch had 
lifted and was disengaged.  The governor and fuel valve were on.  Trapped engine instrument readings 
included oil pressure about 25 [psi], oil temperature about 75 [°F] and cylinder head temperature 
about 200 [°F].  The rotor tachometer needle was on the b ottom peg, while the engine needle was bent 
at a reading of about 58%.  The vertical speed indicator read 300 feet per minute down.

FATAL ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY LOW RPM ROTOR STALL  
 
A primary cause of fatal accidents in light helicopters is failure to maintain  
rotor RPM. To avoid this, every pilot must have his reflexes conditioned  
so he will instantly add throttle and lower collective to maintain RPM in any  
emergency.  
 
The R22 and R44 have demonstrated excellent crashworthiness as long  
as the pilot flies the aircraft all the way to the ground and executes a flare  
at the bottom to reduce his airspeed and rate of descend. Even when going  
down into rough terr ain, trees, wires or water, he must force himself to lower  
the collective to maintain RPM until just before impact. The ship may roll  
over and be severly [sic] damaged, but the occupants have an excellent  
chance of walking away from it without injury.  
 
Power available from the engine is directly proportional to RPM. If the RPM  
drops 10%, there is 10% less power. With less power, the helicopter will  
start to settle, and if the collective is raised to stop it from settling, the RPM  
will be pulled down e ven lower, causing the ship to settle even faster.  
If the pilot not only fails to lower collective, but instead pulls up on the  
collective to keep the ship from going down, the rotor will stall almost  
immediately. When it stalls, the blades will either "blow back " and cut off the  
tail cone or it will just stop flying, allowing the helicopter to fall at an extreme  
rate. In either case, the resulting crash is likely to be fatal.  
 
No matter what causes the low rotor RPM, the pilot must first roll on  
throttle and lower the collective simultaneously to recover RPM before  
investigating the problem. It must be a conditioned reflex. In forward flight,  
applying aft cyclic to bleed off airspeed will also help recover lost RPM.  
 
Safety Notice SN -11 
Issued: O ct 82 Rev: Nov00  
 
LOW -G PUSHOVERS - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS  
 
Pushing the cyclic forward following a pull -up or rapid climb, or even from level flight,  
produces a low -G (weightless) flight condition.  If the helicopter is still pitching forward  
when the pilot  applies aft cyclic to reload the rotor, the rotor disc may tilt aft relative to  
the fuselage before it is reloaded.  The main rotor torque reaction will then combine with  
tail rotor thrust to produce a powerful right rolling moment on the fuselage.  Wit h no lift  
from the rotor, there is no lateral control to stop the rapid right roll and mast bumping  
can occur.  Severe in -flight mast bumping usually results in main rotor shaft separation  
and/or rotor blade contact with the fuselage.  
 
The rotor must b e reloaded before lateral cyclic can stop the right roll.  To reload the rotor,  
apply an immediate gentle aft cyclic, but avoid any large aft cyclic inputs.  (The low -G  
which occurs during a rapid autorotation entry is not a problem because lowering coll ective  
reduces both rotor lift and rotor torque at the same time.)  
 
Never attempt to demonstrate or experiment with low -G maneuvres [sic], regardless of your  
skill or experience level.  Even highly experienced test pilots have been killed investigating  
the low -G flight condition.  Always use great care to avoid any maneuvre [sic] which could  
result in a low -G condition.  Low -G mast bumping accidents are almost always fatal.  
 
  NEVER PERFORM A LOW -G PUSHOVER!!

HIGH WINDS OR TURBULENCE  
A pilot's improper application of control inputs in response to high winds or turbulenc e  
can increase the likelihood of a mast bumping accident.  The following procedures are  
recommended:  
1. If turbulence is expected, reduce power and use a slower than normal cruise  
speed.  Mast bumping is less likely at lower airspeeds.  
2. If significant turbu lence is encountered, reduce airspeed to 60 - 70 knots.  
3. Tighten seat belt and firmly rest forearm on right leg to prevent unintentional  
control inputs.  
4. Do not over -control.  Allow aircraft to go with the turbulence, then restore level flight  
with smooth,  gentle control inputs.  Momentary airspeed, heading, altitude, and  
RPM excursions are to be expected.  
5. Avoid flying on the downwind side of hills, ridges, or tall buildings where the  
turbulence will likely be most severe.  
The helicopter is more susceptible to turbulence at light weight.  Use caution when flying  
solo or lightly loaded .
