  \  \n4.1.1.  This accident was the first in New Zealand to involve an R66.  It was\
  \ the fourth fatal R66 \naccident globally since the type's certification in 2010,\
  \ and the second in which the main rotor \nhad separated in  flight (see Appendix\
  \ 5).35  At the time, approximately 300 R66 helicopters \nhad been manufactured,\
  \ with five of them registered in New Zealand.  \n4.1.2.  The damage  showed  that\
  \ a mast bump had preceded  the in-flight break -up.  A mast bump is  \nusually\
  \  a result of the blades having exceeded the allowable range of flapping.   Robinson\
  \ \nnoted in its Safety Notice SN -11 that \"severe in -flight mast bumping usually\
  \ results in main \nrotor shaft separation and/or rotor blade contact with the fuselage\
  \ \" (Robinson Helicopter \nCompany, 2010) . \n4.1.3.  Previous investigations and\
  \ advice in the Pilot' s Operating H andbook s indicate d that t he \ncausal factors\
  \ of mast bump  accidents involving Robinson helicopters include d: \n\uF0B7 abrupt\
  \ flight control inputs by a pilot  \n\uF0B7 a decrease in the ma in rotor RPM below\
  \ the allowable flight range  \n\uF0B7 a low -G condition.  \n4.2. What happened?\
  \  \n4.2.1.  There was  clear evidence of a severe mast bump and that a main rotor\
  \ blade had struck  the \ncabin .  The main rotor drive shaft separated under a\
  \ combination of bending,  torsional  and \ninertial effects, resulting from its\
  \  being driven by the engine while the blades were prevented \nfrom  turning  because\
  \ they had struck  the fuselage.  \n4.2.2.  The recorded engine parameters  (see\
  \ Appendix 1 ) indicated t hat the engine had been  \noperating normally and within\
  \ limits.  Damage to the engine and attached components \nshowed that it was still\
  \ operating at impact .  The steady engine operation m eant it was very \nunlikely\
  \ that the mast bump followed a low -rotor -RPM state.  Some minor maintenance \n\
  inconsistencies were identified, but no pre-existing technical defect that could\
  \ have preceded \nthe mas t bump event was found.   Nor was any evidence found of\
  \ an unusual event, such as \nincapacitation, involving the pilot.  \n4.2.3.  The\
  \ data transm itted by the Spidertracks unit and the recorded global positioning\
  \ system  \ntracks indicated that the pilot had flown the expected flight paths\
  \ at safe heights.  Based on \nthe last data transmitted by the Spidertracks  unit,\
  \ and witnesses ' observations , the \nenvironmental and aircraft conditions were\
  \ assumed to be as follows:  \n\uF0B7 altitude:   4,000 feet (1,219 metres)  \n\uF0B7\
  \ ground speed:   124 k nots \n\uF0B7 track :   033OT \n\uF0B7 air temperature:\
  \  15OC \n\uF0B7 wind:    135OT, 20 knots . \n4.2.4.  Using t hese values , the\
  \ helicopter's i ndicated airspeed was estimated to have been  115 k nots \nshortly\
  \ before the accident.36,37  The maximum permitted air speed in smooth air under\
  \ the \nsame conditions was 123 k nots.38  Therefore, although relatively high,\
  \ the airspeed was within \nlimits.  \n                                        \
  \                \n35 There have since been three more  fatal R66 accidents, of\
  \ which one likely  involved a mast bump.  \n36 Calculated with an Airtour CRP -5\
  \ flight computer (circular slide rule).  \n37 Robinson conducted a test flight\
  \ in Janu ary 2016 under almost identical conditions and recorded an indicated \n\
  airspeed of 118 knots with 75% torque , the approximate power at the time of the\
  \ accident (see Appendix 1) . \n38 The maximum indicated airspee d was 140 knots\
  \ for gross weights below 998 kilograms  when at sea level, but it \nreduced with\
  \ increasing altitude or air temperature.  \n  \nFinal rep ort AO -2013003 \n<<\
  \ Page 15 >>\n 4.2.5.  Turbulent conditions persisted all day , with strong wind\
  \ gusts near t he middle of the day .  The \nconditions were generally as forecast,\
  \ including the shift  northwards of the area affected by \nstrong wind.  Experienced\
  \ local p ilots who had been flying around the time of the accident, or \nwho took\
  \ part in the search, said conditions were unpleasant.  \n4.2.6.  Most of the R66\
  \ passengers that day said they had not been both ered by the turbulence and \n\
  had experienced worse conditions , but o ne had commented to the pilot that they\
  \ were \"getting \nknocked around a bit, more than in the Hughes 500 \".  The pilot\
  \ had agreed and said he would \nhave preferred to be in the Hughes.  The chief\
  \ pilot later said the Hughes was available if the \npilot had considered it would\
  \ have been more suitable.  \n4.2.7.  The following observations were made by p\
  \ assengers on four different flights:  \n\uF0B7 The seat belt felt tighter as the\
  \ helicopter en countered a bump . \n\uF0B7 The pilot was \"countering gusts, which\
  \ were mainly sideways rather than vertical \". \n\uF0B7 One noticed the pilot \"\
  whack the joystick to the left aggressively \" to counter a \"lurch to \none side\"\
  \ as the helicopter came over a ridge (but the other person on that flight did \n\
  not recall that) . \n\uF0B7 The hunters on the flight before the accident said conditions\
  \ had been  gusty.  \n4.2.8.  Moderate turbulence  can result in mo mentary conditions\
  \  of low G.  A seat belt feeling tighte r \nduring a gust  or bump is consistent\
  \ with  that effect .  If the pilot had indeed moved the cyclic39 \nstick \"to the\
  \ left aggressively \", he w as ver y likely correcting a right roll.   The roll\
  \ might h ave \nbeen caused by a gust, but the  helicopter could also roll right\
  \ if a significant low -G condition  \nwere  encountered at high speed or with high\
  \ power .  The right roll is  cause d by the tail rotor \nthrust line acting above\
  \ the helicopter's centre of gravity.   Robinson cautioned that if an \nuncommanded\
  \ right roll occur red during a low-G condition, aft cyclic had to be applied before\
  \ \napplying any left cyclic to stop the roll .  Applying left cyclic first would\
  \ change the plane of \nrotation of the main rotor blades without the underslung\
  \ fuselage following, and that risked a \nmast bump.  \n4.2.9.  Robinson ha s for\
  \ a long time recommend ed that pilots reduce airspeed if turbulence is \nencountered\
  \ , because t he reduced speed (and power) lessen the effect of turbulence and the\
  \ \nchance of an uncommanded right roll developing .  That advice was contained\
  \  in Safety Notice  \nSN-32, which was  in the P ilot's Operating Handbook for\
  \ each  Robinson helicopter type (see \nAppendix 6) .  When it was first issued\
  \ in 1998, and at the time of this accident, the opening \nsentence of Safety  Notice\
  \ SN-32 stated:  \nFlying in high winds or turbule nce should be avoided . \nThat\
  \ sentence was replaced  in May 2013 (shortly after this accident) with: \nA pilot's\
  \ improper application of control inputs in response to high winds or \nturbulence\
  \ can increase the likelihood of a mast bump accident . \nThe new sentence  shifted\
  \ the emphasis  of the safety notice from a dvising pilots to a void \nhazardous\
  \ weather conditions,  to suggesting that \"improper\" handling was the cause of\
  \ mast \nbump  accidents  in high winds and turbulence.   The notice recommended\
  \ that pilots who \nencount ered turbulence should reduce power and the airspeed\
  \ to between 60 and 70 k nots if \nthe turbulence was \"significant \".  It also\
  \ stated  that pilots should not over -control,  but \nremoved the  earlier  advice\
  \ to \"avoid large or abrupt control movements \".  The revi sed notice  \nadded\
  \ th at a light ly-loaded helicopter was more susceptible to turbulence.  \n4.2.10.\
  \  In February 2016 Robinson revised  Safety Notice SN-32 again;  restoring the\
  \ advice to avoid \nflight in high winds or turbulence , and emphasising the need\
  \ to reduce speed if turbulence \nwas encountered while operating at light -weight\
  \ (see paragraph 6.4 and Appendix 7).  \n                                      \
  \                  \n39 The cyclic stick is one of two main rotor controls.  Movement\
  \ of the cyclic stick causes the rotor blade pitch \nangles to change, which causes\
  \ the rotor 'disc' to tilt in the same direction in which the pilot has put the\
  \ stick.  The \nhelicopter then moves in  that direction. This can be sideways,\
  \ forwards or backwards (aft) or any other direction.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\
  \ report AO -2013 -003 4.2.11.  The weight of the helicopter at the time of the\
  \ accident was estimated to have been 756 \nkilograms, which was at the light end\
  \ of the allowable range of 635 to 1 ,225 kilograms.  The \nairspeed about 30 seconds\
  \ before the accident was  approximately 115 k nots, well above the \nrecommended\
  \ speed of 60 to70 knots for 'significant' turbulent conditions . \n4.2.12.  The\
  \ statements of w itness es on earlier flights and in other helicopters  indicate\
  \ d that  it was \nvery likely the helicopter  encountered moderate  or greater\
  \  turbulence  on the return trip when \nthe accident occurred .  The light weight\
  \ , and possibly a relatively high speed , would have \nexacerbated the effect of\
  \ the turbulence.  If the pilot had reacted to the turbulence with an \ninappropriate\
  \ flight control  input  - for example, an abrupt input, or by applying left cyclic\
  \ in \nresponse to a right roll when experiencing  low G  - that could have caused\
  \  the mast bump and \nthe main rotor blade contact with the fuselage.  \nFinding\
  \ s \n1. The in-flight break -up was caused by a mast bump and main rotor blade\
  \ \ncontact with the fuselage . \n2. The mast bump very likely occurred when the\
  \ helicopter encounter ed \nmoderate or greater  turbulence , which likely resulted\
  \ in a condition of low G.  \nThe effect of any turbulence would have been exacerbated\
  \ by the helicopter's \nlight weight and  estimated  airspeed  of 115 knots . \n\
  3. The possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot\
  \ \ncontributed to the mast bump cannot be excluded.  \n4.3. Safety issues  \n4.3.1.\
  \  While it was very likely that turbulence and  the helicopter 's speed and weight\
  \  contributed to \nthe accident , the Commission also identified the following\
  \ safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 four of the seven fatal R66 accidents that have occurred\
  \ globally since the type was \nintroduced into service in 2010  were mast bump\
  \ or low -main -rotor -RPM accidents, \naccident types seen with the smaller R22\
  \ and R44, which have the same  main r otor \ndesign .40  However, the R66 was certificated\
  \ without any special pilot training \nrequirements  or operating restrictions such\
  \ as the minimum pilot experience and \nmaximum wind strength  that apply to the\
  \ R22  \n\uF0B7 the flight manuals for Robinson helicopters d id not adequately\
  \ warn pilots of the \nhazardous operating practices and environmental conditions\
  \ that can lead rapidly to a \ncatastrophic mast bump  \n\uF0B7 earlier research\
  \ into the flight control systems and dynamic behaviour of the main rotor \nof lightweight\
  \ helicopt ers, such as  the design used by Robinson, was not completed as \nintended.\
  \  Until the behaviour of such rotor system s in conditions of low G and \nturbulence\
  \  is fully understood, it is possible that not all of the causal factors of mast\
  \ \nbump accidents will be identified . \n4.3.2.  These issues, and some observations\
  \ about CAA audits , are discussed  below.  \n  \n                             \
  \                           \n40 As of 24 November 2015, more than 650 R66 helicopters\
  \ had been delivered.  \n  \nFinal rep ort AO -2013003 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.4. Certification\
  \ process for  the R66  \n4.4.1.  A general requirement for the certification of\
  \ a light helicopter ( or 'rotorcraft') was that a pilot \nof average skill must\
  \ be able to take off, climb, turn, land and otherwise manoeuvre the \nhelicopter\
  \ without any danger of over -stressing it.  Federal Aviation  Regulation (FAR)\
  \ Part 27 \nstated this requirement as follows:  \n\xA727.1 41   General .  \nThe\
  \ rotorcraft must \u2014\u2026 \n(b) Be able to maintain any required flight condition\
  \ and make a smooth \ntransition from any flight condition to any other flight condition\
  \ without \nexceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength, and without danger\
  \ o f exceeding \nthe limit load factor under any operating condition probable for\
  \ the type.  \n4.4.2.  The FAA advised that the 'required flight conditions' and\
  \ 'operating conditions probable for the \ntype' meant typical flight manoeuvres,\
  \ not environmental  conditions .  The only environmental \nconsiderations relevant\
  \ to FAR 27.141 were the altitude and temperature ranges in which the \nmanufacturer\
  \ expected the helicopter to operat e.  Another FAR41 considered the effect s of\
  \ \nwind , but only in regard to the helicopter's controllability wh en hovering.\
  \   \nHelicopter response to low G  \n4.4.3.  Since th e R66 was certificated in\
  \ 2010, the flight man ual Limitations section has contained  \nthe following caution\
  \ against making control inputs that could cause a low G condition and \nresult\
  \ in a mas t bump:  \nCAUTION  \nA pushover (forward cyclic maneuver) performed\
  \ from level \nflight or following a pull -up causes a low -G (near weightless)\
  \ \ncondition which can result in catastro phic loss of lateral control \n\u2026\
  \ \n4.4.4.  Turbulence can also cause a  hazardous low-G condition .  However, turbulence,\
  \ unlike altitude \nand temperature, is a n environmental condition that cannot\
  \ be predicted or controlled under \ntest conditions.  The FAA advised that the\
  \ only consideration of a helicopter's behaviour in \nturbulence was the te st pilot's\
  \ qualitative assessment of the amount of cyclic control available \nto overcome\
  \ a moderate gust.42  As two -bladed, teetering main rotor systems like that used\
  \ by \nRobinson were  not intended for low-G flight, the FAA did not consider low\
  \ G to be an 'o perating \ncondition probable for the type'.  Therefore,  the R66\
  \ certification programme was not required \nto test the helicopter's response to\
  \ low G.   \n4.4.5.  Some turbulence is not uncommon when flying, and prudent flying\
  \ suggests that it ought to be \nanticipated  in mountainous areas.  The New Zealand\
  \ experience is that mast bump  accidents \nare more likely to occur in mountainous\
  \ terrain .  Although  turbulence is not an operating \ncondition contemplat ed\
  \ by FAR 27.141 , it is a normal operating hazard .  A low-G conditio n, \nwhich\
  \  can result  from turbulence,  is one of the hazards  that the Flight Standardization\
  \ Boards \nincluded in the special training  for the R22 and R44 . \n4.4.6.  Following\
  \ the Kaweka R66 accident, a very experienced New Zealand helicopter instructor\
  \ \nreported having been surprise d when an R66 rolled at a high rate in a low (but\
  \ positive) G \ncondition.  When the FAA was asked whether this characteristic was\
  \ seen during the R66 \ncertification programme, it replied it had not, stating:43\
  \  \nRight roll characteristics were not  described in any certification flight\
  \ test reports \nreleased to the Fort Worth [Aircraft Evaluation Group] or the [Flight\
  \ \nStandardization Board] for the R66.   Uncommanded right roll did not manifest\
  \ \nitself during any maneuvers specified in the [Practical T est Standards] during\
  \ \n                                                        \n41 FAR 27.143, Controllability\
  \ and maneuverability.  \n42 FAA AC27 -1B, section 27.143 refers.  \n43 Email, 18\

  \ Final report AO -2013 -003 performance of the [Flight Standardization Board],\
  \ nor in any of the certification \nflight test conducted by the [Los Angeles Aircraft\
  \ Certification Office] (LACO).  \n4.4.7.  A representative of the FAA Los Angeles\
  \ Aircraft Certification Office confirmed that the general \nflight characteristics\
  \ tested during the R66 certification had not specifically consider ed the \ntype's\
  \ response to low G.44  Yet Robinson considered that t he various R66 certification\
  \ flight \ntests had include d \"every likely manoeuvre to be performed in service,\
  \ including manoeuvres \nthat exceeded flight limitations \", a reference to push\
  \ -over (low-G) manoeuvres  that were \notherwise prohibited for all three Robinson\
  \ types.  \n4.4.8.  The lowest recorded G during the certification flight tes ts\
  \ was +0.4 G (Robinson Helicopter \nCompany, 2014, p. 3.18) .  That became the target\
  \ minimum G for the R66 Main Rotor \nFlapping Angle Survey  conducted in May 2014,\
  \ one year and two months a fter the Kaweka \naccident  and more  than three years\
  \ after the R66 Flight Standardization Board met .  That \nsurvey recorded a minimum\
  \ G of +0.33 (Robinson Helicopter Company, 2014, p. 4.7) . \n4.4.9.  Although the\
  \ FAA stated that none of its test pilots had encountered uncommanded right roll\
  \ \nduring the R66 certification  programme  and that Robinson had not provided\
  \ any evidence to \nthe FAA of this characteristic, videos of the rotor flapping\
  \ survey flights  showed that roll does \noccur  with low G .  However , in each\
  \ case the test pilot initiated recovery action as soon as the \nanticipated roll\
  \ began . The survey showed that the R66 responds to low G in the same way as \n\
  the R22 and R44.  \nMain r otor blade to fuselage clearance  \n4.4.10.  Robinson's\
  \ Safety Notice SN-11 noted that a sever e mast bump could  lead to main rotor blade\
  \ \ncontact with the fuselage .  A catastrophic accident is almost inevitable  after\
  \ blade contact .  It \nis obvious that the main ( and tail) rotor s must remain\
  \ clear of the helicopter structure  under  \nall operational conditions . That\
  \ requirement is covered by the following certification \nrequirement : \n\xA727.661\
  \    Rotor blade clearance.  \nThere must be enough clearance between the rotor\
  \ blades and other parts of the \nstructure to prevent the blades from striki ng\
  \ any part of the structure during any \noperating condition.  \n4.4.11.  Following\
  \ the NTSB's special investigation into R22 mast bump and low -main -rotor -RPM\
  \ \naccidents, of which  most  involved a main rotor blade striking the fuselage,\
  \ the NTSB  stated \nthat it was concer ned that \"other highly responsive helicopters\
  \ are likely to be designed and \nbuilt that may have characteristics similar to\
  \ the R22 \" and that \"there is a need for the FAA to \nconsider the responsiveness\
  \ of helicopters (especially lightweight, high performanc e \nhelicopters such as\
  \ the R22) as part of the certification process \" (NTSB, 1996, p. 27) .  As a \n\
  result of this concern, the NTSB  recommended in 1996 that the FAA:  \nRequire helicopter\
  \ manufacturers to provide data on the response of helicopters \nto flight control\
  \ inputs to be used as part of the certification process, and require \noperational\
  \ limitations or other measures for those helicopters that are highly \nresponsive\
  \ ( recommendation A-96-11). \n4.4.12.  The NTSB changed the status o f that recommendation\
  \ to 'Closed - Acceptable  Action ' in 2000 \nafter the FAA stated that its rev\
  \ ised guidance to manufacturers addressed large control inputs \nby pilots and\
  \ low-G manoeuvres  that may affect blade -fuselage clearance45 [emphasis added].\
  \  \n4.4.13.  The R66 has the same main  rotor design and some similar flight characteristics\
  \ to the R22 \nand the R44 , and t he R66 certification programme took advantage\
  \ of these similarities.  For \nexample, the FAA a ccepted the results of the earlier\
  \ R44 rotor flapping survey as \ncomplementary evidence that the R66 met the certification\
  \ blade  clearance requirement.   \nRobinson explained the rationale for that approach\
  \ :46 \n                                                        \n44 Teleconference,\

  \ -2013003 \n<< Page 19 >>\n Compliance with 14 CFR 27.661 was demonstrated in conjunction\
  \ with flight \ntesting for demonstration of compliance with the flight requirements\
  \ of 14 CFR \nPart 27, and in -flight strain measurements for demonstration of compliance\
  \ with \nthe fatigue requirements of \xA727.571 \u2026  \nThe maneuvers included\
  \ in the flight tests \u2026 are considered to include every \nlikely maneuver to\
  \ be performed in service, including maneuvers that exceed \nflight limitations.\
  \   The main rotor flight strain survey included push -over \nmaneuvers that induced\
  \ low -g conditions similar to those documented in the \n[R66] Main Rotor Flapping\
  \ Angle Survey report (RTR 673) [see paragraph  \n4.4.7 ].  While the results of\
  \ these flight tests did not include measurements of \nblade clearance, the absence\
  \ of any unusual blade behavior in the course of the \nflight tests was considered\
  \ sufficient for demonstration of compliance with  \n\xA727.661.  \nAs the flight\
  \ characteristics and geometry of the R66 are substantially similar to \nthose of\
  \ the R44, and comprehensive blade clearance data was available for the \nR44 indicating\
  \ blade clearance margins are large, direct measurements of blade \nclear ance were\
  \ not considered necessary for the R66.  \n4.4.14.  The FAA considered the R66 main\
  \ rotor flapping survey to have confirmed th at th e type \ncompli ed with rotor\
  \ clearance requirements.  The Robinson  survey report concluded:  \nBased on the\
  \ test data in this report, it is clear that the R66 rotor system will not \nstall,\
  \ exceed teeter limits, or allow blade contact with the airframe when the \naircraft\
  \ is flown within the approved operating envelope (Robinson Helicopter \nCompany,\
  \ 2014, p. 4.2 8).47 \n4.4.15.  While t he R66 rotor flapping survey demonstrated\
  \ rotor  clearance and that the helicopter had \nan acceptable response to control\
  \ reversals  (a form of abrupt controlling) , the report made the \nfollowing comments\
  \ that  illustrate d a difference between test flying and what an average pilot\
  \ \nmight experience, and that flight test results might not be transferable between\
  \ similar types : \nAlthough control reversal flight characteristics may be similar\
  \ between Robinson \nmodels, small changes in airspeed and pilot technique may produce\
  \ large \nchanges in flight characteristics and component loads during the maneuver\
  \ \u2026  \nWhile control reversals we re performed during the original R66 certification\
  \ \nprogram, they were generally performed quickly enough such that rapid roll rates\
  \ \nwere not generate d (Robinson Helicopter Company, 2014, p. 3.13) . \nAlthough\
  \ low G flight c haracteristics may be similar between Robinson models, \nthe exact\
  \ boundary between 'safe recovery can be performed' and catastrophic \nmast bumping\
  \ cannot be predicted .  Small changes in entry speed and pilot \ntechnique may\
  \ produce large changes in roll rates  (Robinson Helicopter \nCompany, 2014, p.\
  \ 3.19)  [emphasis added].  \n4.4.16.  This acknowledged fine line between safe\
  \ and unsafe outcomes clearly illustrates the hazard \na low-G condition  poses\
  \ for a Robinson helicopter.  F light in mod erate or greater turbulence  \ncan\
  \ result in a low G condition, which means flight in turbulence is a risk that needs\
  \ be \nmitigated .  It also brings into question another conclusion in the Robinson\
  \ blade flapping \nsurvey report : that the rotor system will not allow blade contact\
  \ with the fuselage when the \nhelicopter is flown within the approved limits .\
  \  This issue is discussed in section  4.6. \nSummary of certification issue  \n\
  4.4.17.  The R66 certification programme was not required to test the helicopter's\
  \ response to low G , \nin spite of low G being known to present a serious risk\
  \ of mast bump for the  R22 and R44.  \nRobinson  stated that  the R66 certification\
  \ flights included manoeuvres that induced low-G \nconditions similar to those in\
  \ the main  rotor flapping survey, but the effects , if any,  were not \ndocumented\
  \ .  The rotor flapping survey videos confirmed that the R66 respond ed to low G\
  \ in \nthe same way as the R22 and R44 .  For all three types, an incorrect pilot\
  \ reaction to an \nuncommanded roll c ould result in  a catastrophic mast bump.\
  \  \n                                                        \n47 The operating,\
  \ or flight, envelope is the range of speed, load factor  and altitude for an aircraft,\
  \ as established by \nthe design and verified during certification testing .  \n\
  \n<< Page 20 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -003 4.4.18.  The similarity of the three\
  \ Robinson types in their response to low G shows a need for similar \nknowledge\
  \ and skill requirements for the pilots of any of the types. The Flight Standardization\
  \ \nBoards for all three Robinson types considered that it was essential for pilots\
  \ to have an \nunderstanding of the helicopter s' response to l ow G , but the R66\
  \ Board declined to require \nspecial training for R66 pilots.48    \n4.4.19.  Therefore\
  \ , at present , a person with no prior piloting exp erience can train for a helicopter\
  \ pilot \nlicence on the R66.  The Flight Standardization Board  expected R66 pilots\
  \ to have the same \nessential knowledge regarding Robinson flight and handling\
  \ characteristics as pilots of the \nR22 and R44, but no special training was mandated\
  \  for the R66 .49  Insufficient pilot \nknowledge and experience has been indicated\
  \ as  a likely factor in the South Dakota and \nColombia R66 accidents  (see Appendix\
  \ 5) . \n4.4.20.  Pilots (like the pilot in this accident) who are qualified to\
  \ fly the R22 or  R44 could infer from \nthe lack of any special training for the\
  \ R66 that the R66 does not require the same careful \nhandling as the smaller types.\
  \  The emerging accident trend and instructional experience to \ndate suggest that\
  \ the R66 does require the same ca reful handling.  \n4.4.21.  This accident and\
  \ many others reinforce the need for pilots of Robinson helicopters , including\
  \ \nthe R66,  to understand fully the need for careful handling to avoid low G ,\
  \ have  a clear \nappreciation of the danger of flight in turbulent conditi ons,\
  \ which can also cause low G , and \nunderstand the importance of reducing airspeed\
  \ if turbulence is encountered.  \n4.4.22.  When the R66 Flight Standardization\
  \ Board met, the type had not entered operational service.  \nThe R66 accident history\
  \ to date indicates that the Boards ' decision not to recommend an \nextension of\
  \ SFAR 73 to R66 pilots should be re considered .  The Commission is \nrecommending\
  \  that the Administrator of the FAA extend the knowledge and training \nrequirements\
  \ of SFAR 73 to pilots of the R66.50 \n4.4.23.  Following  a review of Robinson\
  \ safety training in New Zealand, t he CAA issued a consultation \ndocument outlining\
  \ its intention to require pilots to complete, in essence, the SFAR 73 training\
  \ \nas part of  an R66 type rating, and also its intention to reinstate the SFAR\
  \  73 training for R44 \npilots.  Following industry consultation, the Director\
  \ of Civil Aviation (the Director) obtained \nCourt authority to reinstate the SFAR\
  \ 73 training for the R44, but no application was made to \nthe Court in respect\
  \ of the R66 .  Therefore , the Commission is recommending that the D irector  \n\
  require pilots to complete the SFAR 73 training , or an equivalent  requirement,\
  \ as a \nprerequisite for the issue of an R66 type rating.  \nFindings  \n4. The\
  \ R66 global accident history , in the five years since the ty pe was introduced\
  \ \ninto service in 2010 , suggests that the R66 is as vulnerable as the smaller\
  \ \nR22 and R44 to a catastrophic mast bump  under certain conditions . \n5. The\
  \ R66 was certificated without any special  pilot training requirements to \nmitigate\
  \ the risk of a catastrophic mast bump . \n \n4.5. Flight manual reference s to\
  \ hazardous practices and conditions  \n4.5.1.  The available information on the\
  \ fatal R66 accidents to date suggested that not all of the  \ninvolved  pilots\
  \ had flown the smaller R22 or R44  and received the SFAR 73 training applicable\
  \ \nto those types .  But  even those pilots who did have R22 or R44 experience\
  \ were unable to  \navoid their  accident s. \n                                \
  \                        \n48 Refer sectio n 3.9, Special training requirements\
  \ for pilots of Robinson helicopters .  \n49 Robinson submitted that the pilot training\
  \ syllabus in the United States covered all of the awareness topics in \nSFAR 73\
  \ , including low G . \n50 Refer to s ection 3.9 of this report.   \n  \nFinal rep\
  \ ort AO -2013003 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.5.2.  If a flight condition is so critical\
  \ that any exceedance could be catas trophic, such as the low G \npushover de scribed\
  \ in paragraph 4.4.3, the flight manual  should contain an explicit  'warning' ,\
  \ \nusing  the terminology  that has become standard in aviation and other technical\
  \ industr ies.51  \nThe FAA guidelines recommended the use of  'warning' if there\
  \ was a risk of death or injury, \nand use d 'caution' for situations with a risk\
  \ of equipment damage.52  However, Robinson's \nflight manuals follow ed the United\
  \ States General Aviation Manufacturers Association 's \nSpecification No.1, which\
  \ did  not define 'warnings', 'cautions' and 'notes'.   Instead, Robi nson \ndefined\
  \ 'caution' to include the risk of death or injury as well as equipment damage .\
  \ \n4.5.3.  Robinson provide d good, plain -language guidance for various aspects\
  \ of flight operations, in \nthe Safety Tips and Notices section  of the Pilot's\
  \ Operating Handbook s.  For example, Safety \nNotice SN -32, High Winds or Turbulence\
  \ ( see Appendix 6) contain ed critical information  to \nhelp pilots avoid mast\
  \ bumps.  The information deserved  to be headed 'Warning' , because a \nmast bump\
  \ would likely be catastrophic.  However, the safety notices w ere not a part of\
  \ the \nFAA-approv ed flight manual.  Therefore,  apart from the conditional limits\
  \ in airworthiness \ndirective 95 -26-04 for the R22, there was no referenc e to\
  \ turbulence in any FAA-approved \nRobinson flight manual  at the time of this accident.\
  \  \n4.5.4.  Since 2008, in addition to this accident, the Commission has inquired\
  \ into two R22 and one \nR44 mast bump accidents, in circumstances where turbulence\
  \ was a factor.  Th e CAA has also \ninvestigated another two R22 accidents of this\
  \ sort in that period.  \n4.5.5.  For this reason , the Commission disagree d with\
  \ an industry view, expressed at  the May 2013 \nflight instructors' forum , that\
  \ th e lack of an explicit warning about the sensitivity of Robinson \nhelicopters\
  \ to turbulence  was not a safety  issue .  The accident record indicate d that\
  \ it is an \nissue and that the hazard  should be explicitly s tated  and appropriate\
  \ mitigation put in place . \n4.5.6.  In January 2015 Robinson increased the a ttention\
  \ given to the hazard of turbulence by adding \nthe following Caution to  the Normal\
  \ Procedures sections  of the R66 (and R44) flight manuals:  \nCAUTION  \n If turbulence\
  \ is expected, reduce power  \n and use a slower than normal cruise speed.  \n4.5.7.\
  \  Each pilot of an aircraft shall, before beginning a flight, be familiar with\
  \ the aircraft flight \nmanual.53  That requires pilots  to be aware of any changes\
  \ to the manual.  Amendments are \nnormally notified by manufacturers to registered\
  \ owners of the aircraft type and to sub scribers \nto an amendment notification\
  \ service for the type.  The full, current content of each Robinson \nPilot's Operating\
  \ Handbook is  also freely available on -line. \n4.5.8.  The addition of the above\
  \ Caution to the Robinson R66 and R44 flight manuals, and the \nchang es made in\
  \ February 2016 to Safety Notice SN -32, ha s significantly increased the \nattention\
  \ given to the hazard of turbulence and could help reduce the incidence of mast\
  \ \nbumps , provided pilots are made aware of and understand the significance of\
  \ this important \ninformation .  Given the critical importance these latest 'Cautions'\
  \ published by Robinson \nhelicopters  have for improving the safety of Robinson\
  \ helicopter flight safety in New Zealand , \nthe Commission consider s these changes\
  \ warrant wider publicit y within New Zealand .  \nAccordingly, the Commission recommended\
  \ to the Director of Civil Aviation that he promptly \npublicise the changes to\
  \ the New Zealand helicopter community.  \n4.5.9.  In April 2015 the Commission\
  \ recommended that the Administrator of the FAA requ ire \nRobinson to use the term\
  \ ' warning' for those operating conditions and practices that involve a \nrisk\
  \ of personal injury or loss of life.54  On 1 7 November 2015 t he FAA replied that\
  \ Robinson \nflight manuals included a definition of 'Caution' that was a com bination\
  \ of the traditional \n                                                        \n\
  51 This issue was discussed in Commission inquiry report 11 -003, in -flight break\
  \ -up, ZK -HMU, Robinson R22, near \nMount Aspiring, 27 April 2011; and inquiry\
  \ report 13 -005, in -flight loss of control, Robinson R22, ZK -HIE, near New \n\
  Plymouth, 30 March 2013.  \n52 FAA Advisory Circular 27 -1 refers.  \n53 Civil Aviation\

  \ Page 22 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -003 (industry practice) definitions of Warning\
  \ and Caution.  The FAA believed \"there would be little \nadded value in having\
  \ Robinson change its flight manuals\" and therefore it considered the \nrecommendation\
  \ \"Closed Not Adopted\".  \nFinding \n6. At the time of the accident, t he Robinson\
  \ helicopter flight manuals d id not \nadequately warn  pilots  of the hazardous\
  \ operating practices and \nenvironmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a\
  \ catastrophic mast bump .  \nThis type of accident is strongly associated with\
  \ turbulen t conditions . \n4.6. Dynamic behaviour of the Robinson main rotor system\
  \   \n4.6.1.  The R66 main rotor flapping survey report, like that for the R44 and\
  \ the earlier FAA special \ncertification reviews of the R22  (see Appendix 3) ,\
  \ concluded that the r otor system will not \nallow blade contact with the fuselage\
  \ when the helicopter is flown within the approved limits .   \nInvestigations into\
  \ in-flight break -up accidents , which typically show evidence of a mast bump,\
  \  \nhave rarely proven  that the pilots  mishand led the helicopter or exceeded\
  \ the flight manual \nlimits .  Causal factors other than pilot handling and the\
  \ operating environment may have been \ninvolved.  Therefore, p reventive actions\
  \ other than pilot training , operational limitations  and \nflight manual clarit\
  \ y may be required.  \n4.6.2.  The recommendation made in 1996 by the NTSB to the\
  \ FAA to examine the design and the \ndynamic behaviour of the Robinson main rotor\
  \  (as the exemplar lightweight rotor system)  for \nany possible contribution to\
  \  such  accidents was closed before the research was completed.   \nThe Georgia\
  \ Institute of Tech nology  found  in their theoretical study  that \"gusts under\
  \ \nmoderate conditions seem not to be a problem \", but they recommend ed further\
  \ study of the \nproblem  (see Appendix 3,  paragraph 10).  The lack of exact knowledge\
  \ on the dynamics of \nmain rotor blade behaviour persists.  \n4.6.3.  The introduction\
  \ to the FAA's airworthiness directive  95-26-04 (for the R22) inferred that the\
  \ \nFAA anticipated corrective design changes to reduce or elimi nate this type\
  \ of accident.  The \nairworthiness directive stated, in part:  \nUntil the FAA\
  \ completes its research into the conditions and aircraft \ncharacteristics that\
  \ lead to main rotor blade / fuselage contact accidents, and \ncorrective type design\
  \ changes a nd operating limitations are identified \u2026  \n4.6.4.  Robinson made\
  \ c hanges to the engine controls to reduce the risk of low rotor RPM, but the \n\
  main rotor system design  remains unchanged .  The NTSB special investigation \"\
  found no \ndirect evidence of an unstable blade or rotor system design.  The extensive\
  \ operational \nhistory, the wreckage evidence, flight tests, and computer simulations\
  \ indicate that a \ndynamically unstable [R22] main rotor system is unlikely \"\
  \ (NTSB, 1996, p. 25) .  The NTSB \nrecognised that there could be other  explanations\
  \ for the accidents.  \n4.6.5.  The avoidance of conditions that might cause a main\
  \ rotor to strike the fuselage  relies \nprimarily  on pilots maintain ing the correct\
  \ rotor RPM , and their diligent observ ance of  the \nprohibition against deliberate\
  \ low G and the caution to \"avoid abrupt control inputs \".  Pilots \nshould learn\
  \ w hat constitutes an 'abrupt'  control input during their initial training . \
  \ The NTSB \nnoted that the 1995 flight test s of the R44 rotor flapping  angles\
  \ \"were not (and could not \nsafely be) conducted to determine the helicopter's\
  \ response to large, abrupt cyclic inputs \" and \n\"the flight test did not provide\
  \ the data needed to determine the mechanism for the blade \ndiverging into the\
  \ body \" (NTSB, 1996, p. 23) . \n4.6.6.  Post-certification flight testing of the\
  \ R22 (in 1982) and the R44 (1995) by Robinso n and the \nFAA concluded that each\
  \  helicopter  was safe when \"flown within its approved limitations \" and \n\"\
  could safely perform any nominal flight activity without main rotor divergence tendencies\
  \ \" \n(NTSB, 1996, p. 23) .  However,  a helicopter could be  operating within\
  \ the approved limits , but \nunintentionally exceed a design limitation without\
  \ a pilot input ; for example , when  \nencountering low G or in turbulence . The\
  \ R22 and R44 Flight Standardization Boards in 1995 \n  \nFinal rep ort AO -2013003\
  \ \n<< Page 23 >>\n noted that \"flight conducted in normal operating conditions\
  \ may cause an encounter with such \nhazards \". \n4.6.7.  Robinson submitted that\
  \ turbulence alone cannot  lead to low G mast bump ing, adding that  an \nimproper\
  \ input or reaction by the pilot was also required .  Although it is clear from\
  \ operational \nexperience that Robinson helicopters can be operated safely in some\
  \ degree of turbulence, \nthe Commission considers  that Robinson h as not proven\
  \ conclusively that a pilot input is \nnecessary  for a mast bump , for the following\
  \ reasons:  \n\uF0B7 The rotor system behaviour in turbulence has not been fully\
  \ teste d. \n\uF0B7 The low G  conditions that have been tested were  planned manoeuvres\
  \ as part of  \nblade flapping surveys.  In those tests, the test pilot initiated\
  \ recovery action \nimmediately the helicopter began the expected right roll , thereby\
  \ avoiding any \nsubsequent dynamic response . \n\uF0B7 No minimum G is specified\
  \ for Robinson helicopters, and little cognisance is given to \nthe counter -intuitive\
  \ response required of a pilot (who is unlikely to be  a test pilot) \nfaced with\
  \ an un -commanded right roll under low G. \n\uF0B7 Many of the fatal Robinson mast\
  \ bump accidents in N ew Zealand  have occurred in \nturbulent conditions, and it\
  \ was impossible to state what control inputs were or might \nhave been  made  immediately\
  \ prior to  the mast bumps.   \n4.6.8.  The critical and sensitive nature of the\
  \ flight controls was made cle ar in the R66 rotor flapping \nsurvey report , which\
  \ stated  \"the exact boundary between 'safe recovery can be performed ' \nand catastrophic\
  \ mast bumping cannot be predicted \".  Studies by the NTSB and \nmanufacturers\
  \ have shown that , due to the relative movement o f the main rotor blades and \n\
  the fuselage  during manoeuvres, the required separation can be lost completely\
  \  in less than a \nsecond .  All of the conditions that can lead to a Robinson\
  \ main rotor blade striking the \nfuselage have not been  fully explained, but it\
  \ is too dangerous to  explore the problem  with \nflight tests .  Until the dynamic\
  \ behaviour of the rotor system under conditions of low G is fully \nunderstood,\
  \ it is likely that not all of the causal factors in accidents of this type will\
  \ be \nidentified, and therefore the appropriate recommendations to prevent a recurrence\
  \ might not \nbe made.  \n4.6.9.  Since 1995, computational sciences and aerospace\
  \ e ngineering have advanced to such a \ndegree that a fuller  understanding of\
  \ the dynamic behaviour of lightweight, teetering,  \nunderslung rotor systems ought\
  \ to be possible.   For example, instrumented, remotely \ncontrolled  helicopter\
  \ s could provide data on the rotor behaviour under conditions  that are too \n\
  dangerous for test pilots .  Such a project could help  to eliminat e mast bump\
  \  accidents.  \n4.6.10.  Therefore , the Commission is recommending that the Administrator\
  \ of the FAA r einstate \nresearch into the dynamic behaviour of two-bladed, teetering,\
  \ underslung rotor systems, \ntaking full advantage of the technology now available,\
  \ with the aim of  achieving the intended \ngoals of NTSB recommendation A -96-12.\
  \ \nFinding  \n7. There is insufficient industry  knowledge of why Robinson helicopters\
  \ are \nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events.  \n \n  \n\n<<\

  \ \n4.7.1.  The pilot  was effectively making his own operational decisions because\
  \ he flew alone, but he \nwas still under the close supervision of the chief pilot\
  \ .  The operator was required to have a \ntraining programme that ensured its pilots\
  \ were competent to perform their as signed duties.55  \nThe relevant  advisory\
  \ circular, 119-3, specified that the programme should include a \nmountain flying\
  \ element if the area of operations included mountainous terrain.  Most of the \n\
  operator's work was in a designated mountainous area.  \n4.7.2.  The CAA issued\
  \ a specific  approval to persons and certificated training organisations who \n\
  could conduct advanced mountain training.  Neither the operator nor its authorised\
  \ flight \ntraining provider held that approval.  \n4.7.3.  An operator's training\
  \ programme could  be varied, but the reason had to be noted in the \naffected pilot's\
  \ training record.  The operator's records did not show that the pilot in this case\
  \ \nhad completed or been excused from mountain flying training relevant to his\
  \ role.  However, \nthe training re cords did show that he had been supervised over\
  \ most of the operator's routes \nand into most landing sites, including the Mangatarame\
  \ a Hut.  The chief pilot explained that  \nthose flights had included demonstration\
  \ s of and discussion s about mountain flying \nprocedures , as had the pilot's\
  \ R66 type rating training and his initial competency check with \nthe external\
  \ flight examiner .  Although the operator's records did not show that the pilot\
  \ had \nbeen given  mountain flying training specific to the role, it is highl y\
  \ likely that he had  receiv ed \nsuch training .  Therefore , the Commission determine\
  \ d that the pilot's training  was unlikely to \nhave been a factor in the accident.\
  \  \n4.7.4.  The safety of the New Zealand civil aviation system relies, in part,\
  \ on the effectiveness and \nreliability of the CAA's risk -based surveillance system\
  \ .  The p rimary tools in this system \ninclude d the routine audits and spot checks\
  \ of operators' adherence to the standards and \nconditions of their aviation documents.\
  \  The focus of the audits is \"on what is actually \nhappening versus the procedures\
  \ that the organisation has documented to show how it \ncarries out its activities\
  \ \" (CAA, 2012, p. 8) . \n4.7.5.  The CAA conducted a routine audit of the operator\
  \ in March 2010.  The operator was re-\ncertified in February 2013, two weeks before\
  \ the accident.   \n4.7.6.  A further routine audit was conducted in  March 2014\
  \ .  The report of that  audit , in line with the \nCAA's policy , contained  no\
  \ commentary by the auditors on the operator's performance or \nrelat ive safety\
  \ risk .  The report included a summary of approximately 480 rules (or sections\
  \ of \nrules) \"that were tested during this audit \", all of which were  ticked\
  \ to show that the operator \nwas \"found to b e compliant \".  The size of the\
  \ list was so inordinatel y large for an audit as to \ncall into question the integrity\
  \ of the audit.   The CAA later agreed56 that:  \nthis audit report is unlikely\
  \ to portray an accurate representation of the rules \nsampled \u2026 staff are\
  \ now more conscious of the expectation and importance  of \nonly marking off the\
  \ rules that were checked.  \n4.7.7.  The Surveillance Risk Assessment Form prepared\
  \ prior to that audit had a recommendation, \nmade on 20 February 2014 by the CAA\
  \ unit manager, for auditors to \"conduct an in -depth \naudit of the [operator's]\
  \ pilot training and competency programme \" and to \"review the \ncompany's approach\
  \ to mountain flying training \".  These were  appropriate instructions  to \nmake\
  \  following the Kaweka accident.  The post -audit report stated that the operator's\
  \ \nexposition57 complied with Rule 135.553(a) regarding training programmes . \
  \ However, the \nCommission 's staff  found  no reference to mountain flying training\
  \ in the exposition  as late as \nJuly 2015.  As a result of the Commission asking\
  \ for this anomaly to be explained , the CAA in \nAugust 2015 asked  the operator\
  \ to submit a revised training programme.  \n                                  \
