The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor  the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the  
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for  inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and  
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 9 March 2013 a Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson)  R66 helicopter crashed  in the 
North Island's Kaweka Range  after  experiencing  an occurrence known as a 'mast bump '.  A 
main rotor blade then struck the fuselage , causing the helicopter to break up in flight.   The 
pilot, who was the only person on board, was killed.  
1.2. The weather was suitable for the flight, which was conducted under visual flight rules in 
uncontrolled airspace.  However, t he wind strength had increased during the day , leading to 
patches of mod erate turbulence in the mountainous terrain.   It was very likely that turbulence 
was a factor in the accident.  The helicopter' s light gross weight and  relatively high speed at 
the time would have exacerbated the  effects of any turbulence . 
1.3. The Commission found that this accident, when consid ered alongside four other R66 
accidents that have occurred globally  in the five years since  the helicopter type was 
introduced into service  in 2010 , suggested that the R66 was as vulnerable as the smaller 
Robinson R22 and R44 types to a catastrophic mast bump under certain conditions.   The R66 
has the same main rotor system design  as the R 22 and  the R 44. 
1.4. The R66 was certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States without 
any special training requirements like th ose that are mandated for pilots of the R22 and  the 
R44 to reduce the risk of mast bump accidents .  That was i n spite of having the same main 
rotor design and a similar  response to low G conditions as the R22 and R44 .  The Civil Aviation 
Authority of New Zealand accepted the Federal Aviation Administration  type certificate for the 
R66 in April 2011, and also d id not require special training for R66 pilots.  
1.5. A safety issue arose  as a result  of there being no special training.    A helicopter pilot (or 
trainee) with no prior experience  of flying one of the smaller Robinson types  could  fly the R66  
without necessarily having the knowledge and training that the Federal Aviation Administration  
acknowledged was essentia l for pilots of all Robinson types .  There was also a risk that a pilot 
who did have prior R22 or R44  experience would  infer , from  the lack of a ny special training 
requirement , that the R66 d id not require the same careful handling  as the smaller types . 
1.6. Recommendations were made to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration  and 
the Director of Civil Aviation to require additional  training as a prerequisite for an R66 type 
rating . 
1.7. It is likely that  mast bump accidents with Robinson helicopters will continue to happen  unless 
the dynamic behaviour of the main rotor preced ing such a catastrophe is fully understood.  A 
recommendation was made to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration  to 
reinstate uncompleted research into the dynamic behaviour of lightweight helicopter main 
rotor systems.  
1.8. A further recommendation was made to the Director of Civil Aviation to publicise the recent 
amendments to the Robinson R66 and R44 Pilot's Operating Handbooks that caution against 
flight in high winds and turbulence.  
Safety issues  
1.9. The following safety issues  were identified in this investigation:  
 Four of the seven fatal R66 accidents that have occurred globally since the type was 
introduced into service in 2010  were mast bump or low -main -rotor --speed  accidents .  
These are  accident  types  seen with the smaller R22 and R44 , which have  the same  main 
rotor design .  However, t he R66 was certificated without any  special  pilot training 
requirements to mitigate the risk of th ese types  of accident . 
 At the time of this accident the flight manuals for Robinson helicopters d id not adequately 
warn pilots of the hazard ous operating practices and environmental conditions that can 
lead rapidly to  a catastrophic mast bump . 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003  Earlier research into the flight control systems and dynamic behaviour of the main rotor 
of lightweight helicopters, for example,  the design used by Robinson, wa s not completed 
as intended.  Until the behaviour of such rotor system s in conditions of low G and 
turbulence is fully understood, it is possible that not all of the causal factors of mast 
bump  accident s will be identified . 
Findings  
1.10.  The Commiss ion made the following findings : 
 The in-flight break -up was caused by a mast bump and main rotor blade contact with the 
fuselage . 
 The mast bump very likely occurred when the helicopter encountered moderate or greater  
turbulence, which likely resulted in a condition of low G.2  The effect of any turbulence 
would have been exacerbated by the helicopter's light weight and  estimated  airspeed  of 
115 knots . 
 The possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot contributed to 
the mast bump cannot be excluded . 
 The R66 global accident history , in the five years since the type  was introduced into 
service in 2010 , suggests that th e R66 is as vulnerable as the smaller R22 and R44 to a 
catastrophic mast bump  under certain conditions . 
 The R66 was c ertificated without any special  pilot training requirements to mitigate the 
risk of a catastrophic mast bump . 
 At the time of the accident, the Robinson helicopter flight manuals d id not adequately 
warn pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can 
lead rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump .  This type of accident is strongly associated 
with turbulen t conditions . 
 There is insufficient industry  knowledge of why Robinson helicopters are particularly 
vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events . 
 In spite of the lack of reference in the operator's exposition to mountain flying training, 
the pilot's training was unlikely to have been a factor in the accident.  
Recommendations  
1.11.  The Commission made the following recommendations : 
To the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration : 
 That he extend the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation 
Regulation No.  73 to pilots of the Robinson R66 helicopter . 
 That he reinstate research into the dynamic behaviour of two-bladed, teetering ,3 
underslung rotor systems, taking full advantage of available technology, with the aim of 
achieving the original goal of N ational Transportation Safety Board (United States ) 
recommendation A-96-12. 
To the Director of Civil Aviation:  
 That he include the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation 
Regulation No.  73, or an equivalent requirement,  as a prerequisite for the issue of a  
Robinson R66 type rating . 
 That he promptly publicise the recent amendments to the Robinson R66 and R44 Pilot's 
Operating Handbooks that caution against flight in high winds and turbulence, and which 
advise pilots to reduce power and speed if turbulence is expected or encountered.  
                                                        
2 A low-G condition occurs when an object is subjected to a net vertical force less than the force of gravity.  
3 Teetering is the see -saw movement of a two -bladed, centrally mounted rotor hub .

 Key lessons  
1.12.  The key lessons  identified from  the inquiry into this accident  were:  
 Pilots must be familiar with the complete Pilot's Operating Handbook for each  aircraft 
type that they fly, as well as  the approved flight manuals . 
 Pilots of Robinson helicopters, regardless of their experience, should avoid  areas of high 
winds  or turbulence, and closely adhere to the manufacturer's advice to reduce airspeed 
if turbulence is encountered.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On Saturday 9 March 2013 the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand ( CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) that an R66 was overdue from 
a flight  and that a search was underway .  After the accident site had been located later that 
day, t he Commission opened an inquiry  under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 . 
2.2. On 10 March 2013 t wo Commission investigators began an  inspection of the accident site .  
Most of the wreckage was recovered by 12 March 2013, but the main rotor hub and blades  
were not found until 13 March  2013.   The wreckage was taken to the Commission's storage 
facility near Wellington.  
2.3. On 11 March 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board (United States)  (NTSB ) 
appointed a staff member to be the Accredited Representativ e4 of the United States, the State 
of Manufacture of the helicopter and the engine .  The Accredited Representative 's advisers , 
from Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson)  and Rolls -Royce  (the engine manufacturer ), 
assist ed the Commission's investigators with a wreckage examination conducted between 15 
and 18 March 2013.  
2.4. The engine was disassembled and examined on 1 May 2013 at the Rolls -Royce factory  in the 
United States , under the supervision of the NTSB on behalf of the Commission .  The flight 
control h ydraulic servos5 and the  engine -transmission clutch were examined at  the Robinson 
factory in the United States , again under NTSB supervision.  
2.5. On 9 May 2013 Commission investigators hosted a forum to further their understanding of 
issues relating to the performance and handling of Robinson helicopters, and the training 
provided to pilots of Robinson helicopters.  At the time the Commission had th ree open 
investigations into accidents that involved Robinson helicopters.  The forum participants 
comprised  six experienced helicopter instructors, three CAA staff  and five Commission staff.   
2.6. Two engine accessories, the power turbine governor and the fuel control unit , were examined 
on 14 May 2013 at the premises of their manufacturer  in the United States, under the 
supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration  (United States)  (FAA) inspector acting for the 
NTSB . 
2.7. The pathologist who conducted the post -mortem examination of the pilot inspected the 
helicopter wreckage at the Commission's storage facility.  
2.8. The Commission contracted the Defence Technology Agency of the New Zealand Defence 
Force to determine the failure mode  of the main rotor drive shaft.  
2.9. On 13 June  2013 , after advice that other items of wreckage had been found, the accident site 
was re-visited  with the support of the Royal New Zealand Air Force,  and a small amount of 
material was recovered.  
2.10.  The Commission obtained information from the NTSB, Robinson and the FAA at various times 
throughout the inquiry.  
2.11.  On 24 September 2015  the Commission approved the draft final report for circulation to 
interested persons  for their comment .  Submissions were received from three  of the 
interested persons.  The  Commission has considered all submissions , and any changes as a 
result of those submissions have been included in this final report.  
2.12.  On 27th April 2016  March 2016 the Commis sion approved publication of the final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Saturday 9 Ma rch 2013 , a Robinson R66 helicopter (the helicopter) was being used to 
ferry hunters and fishermen to and from  remote sites in th e Kaweka and Kaimanawa Range s.  
The pilot had commenced duty at about 0900 and had made five return flights during the 
morning carrying passengers to or from various landing sites . 
3.1.2.  The flights were conducted under visual flight rules  in uncontrolled airspace .  The weather was 
generally clear and warm but, according to the passenger s, some turbulence had been 
experienced on every  flight  that day . 
3.1.3.  On the last flight  before the accident flight  the pilo t flew two hunters to the Mangat aramea 
Hut.  The hunters were familiar with helicopters: one ha d been a pilot  for a different operator , 
and the other ha d also flown in this helicopter twice  before .  They described the pilot as 
engaging and conscientious.  They said the flight was "normal " and the conditions "a little 
gusty " with a "bump " when they cross ed one saddle, but otherwise they had no  concern .  
3.1.4.  Having  delivered the hunters to the hut, the pilot was returning alone via the Waitawhero 
Saddle and the Oamaru River valley to the operator's base at Poronui Station .  The last data 
transmitted from a n on-board 'S pidertracks' unit6 was as follows:  
 time:   0001:30 co-ordinated universal time  (1301 :30 New Zealand Daylight 
  Time)  
 position:  39o 8.23' south, 177o 11.898' east  
 altitude:  4,006 feet7 (1,221 metres)  
 ground speed:  124 knots8 
 heading:  033 degrees true (OT).9 
3.1.5.  When the helicopter was 30 minutes overdue at the base , the operator's chief pilot promptly 
commenced a search , guided by the last Spidertracks  position .  No signal was received from 
the on -board emergency locator transmitter .  Although the search was hampered by strong 
winds and turbulence, t he accident  site was located later that day  in dense bush , 
approximately 1,500 metres  after  the last transmitted position  (see Figure 1) .  The fatally 
injured pilot was found the next morning , about 30 metres from the fuselage .  The main rotor, 
which had separated from the mast ,10 was found three  days later . 
3.1.6.  Based on the last ground speed  transmitted by an on -board tracking device , the accident 
occurred at around  1302 in daylight , 600 metres south of the Oamaru River , at an elevation of 
approximately  3,400 feet (1,040 metres)  above mean sea level.  
3.2. Personnel information  
3.2.1.  The pilot had obtained a private pilot licence (aeroplane) in 1996 , then taken  a break from 
flying  until he commenc ed helicopter training in January 2012  on the Robinson R22 .  Prior to  
his first solo flight in the R22 he had completed the special awareness  and flight  training  
(special training)  required for all R22 pilots.11  He had obtained a private pilot licence 
                                                        
6 Spidertracks is a proprietary tracking system that sends the global positio ning system -derived position of the unit 
by text message to a satellite constellation and then to a ground -based server.  
7 Vertical distances in aviation are still expressed in imperial units.  
8 A knot is a speed of one nautical mile per hour.  
9 This was taken to be the track over the ground, rather than the helicopter heading.  
10 The drive shaft is sometimes called the 'mast', although that term may also be applied to the aerodynamic 
fairing installed around  the drive shaft  to reduce drag and improve appearance . 
11 Section 3.9 describes this requirement.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 (helicopter) in March 2012 and a commercial pilot licence (helicopter) in May 2012.  While 
training for the commercial licence he had also obtained a  Robinson  R44 type rating .12 
3.2.2.  The operator had hired the pilot  on 6 June 2012 , on the recommendation of his instructor .  
The operator's appr oved external flight examiner had conducted the  pilot's initial crew 
competency check on 15 June 2012, in conjunction with the pilot obtaining an R66 type 
rating.  The examiner had marked the pilot as competent in all of the tested flight tasks, and 
for 'mountainous terrain awareness'.  
 
Figure 1 
Wreckage of fuselage  
3.2.3.  For the first three months after starting with the operator , the pilot had flown  only the R44 , 
mainly o n scenic flights from the company's Taupo base .  The chief pilot had flown  with the 
pilot until he was familiar with the company's procedures and the many remote landing sites . 
3.2.4.  For the next three months the pilot had mainly flown  the R66, but he  had also obtained a type 
rating for the Hughes  500, another  type in the operator 's fleet .  According to the operator's 
records, the pilot had been  due for  recurrent training in April 2013.  
3.2.5.  The pilot had 492 hours ' flight experience, of which 420 hours were in helicopters .  The 
helicopter  hours  included  350 in Robinson types , with nearly 160 hours in the R66.   In the 90 
days before  the accident he had flown  approximately 148 hours, split evenly between the R66 
and the Hughes 500.  
3.2.6.  His last days free of duty had been 2 March and 3 March 2013.  In the next five days he had 
been  on duty for 47 hours and flown  10.8 hours , including about four hours on 9 March .  
Those who spoke with him on 9 March 2013 said he appeared to be well, alert and fit to fly . 
                                                        
12 A type rating is the authorisation associated with a pilot's licence that states the pilot is qualified to fly a specific 
aircraft type.

 3.2.7.  The chief pilot said the pilot had been  cautious, disciplined and highly motivated.   Amateur 
videos made by passengers earlier in 2013 showed the pilot flying t he R66 conservative ly. 
3.2.8.  The pilot's medical certificate was valid until 15 May 2013 and had no restrictions, 
endorsements or limitations.  
3.3. Aircraft information  
General  
3.3.1.  The R66 is a five-seat, turbine -powered  light helicopter that is manufactured by Robinson  in 
the United States .  The R66  was certificated by the FAA in October 2010.  In many  respects it 
is a larger variant  of Robinson's four-seat R44, which itself evolved from the two-seat 
Robinson  R22.13 
3.3.2.  The R66 is powered by a Rolls -Royce 250C -300 (RR300) turbo -shaft engine, also 
manufactured in the United States.  The 300 -horsepower engine was certificated by the FAA in 
December 2007.   
3.3.3.  All three Robinson types have two-blade, teeter ing main rotor s.  The blades have independent 
flapping hinges, a feature unique to Robinson14 (see Figure 2).   Helicopters with two-blade, 
teetering main rotor systems must avoid low -G conditions ,15 because these  can cause the 
helicopter to roll without its pilot making a control  input ( an uncommanded roll ) if the tail rotor  
(sideward)  thrust acts  at a distance well above the helicopter's centre of gravity .16  The R66 
flight manual prohibited intentional low -G manoeuvres.  
3.3.4.  The R66 main rotor controls , like those of the R44 and R22,  are considered to be sensitive .  
This is  reflected in the following  limitation in the flight manual  (Robinson Helicopter Company, 
2010, p. 2.5) : 
CAUTION  
Abrupt control inputs may produce high 
fatigue stresses and cause catastrophic 
failure of a critical component.   
3.3.5.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook  comprised  the mandatory FAA-approved flight manual , as well 
as a section of "Safety Tips  and Notices"  issued by Robinson.  These safety tips and notices 
are applicable to all Robinson types .  Several of the  safety notices  provided guidance to pilots 
on how to avoid a potentially catastrophic 'loss of control' of the main rotor.  'Loss of control' 
refers to the main rotor blades flying a path that might be d ifferent from  that intended by the 
pilot, perhaps because of a low -G condition or because the rotor revolutions per minute (RPM) 
have decreased well below the specified, narrow range.  
3.3.6.  The helicopter involved in this accident had been  manufactured in Novemb er 2011 and 
bought by the operator that month.  The engine had been  manufactured in 2010.  
3.3.7.  Records indicated that the helicopter had been maintained in accordance with the approved 
maintenance manual and instructions (see Appendix 1 for details of recent m aintenance).  
The technical log and daily flight record, which were required to be carried in the helicopter, 
were  not found.  According to the operator's records the helicopter would have accrued 
approximately 739 flight hours, and the engine 786 cycles, up to the day before the accident.  
3.3.8.  The pilot had recorded a fuel endurance of 1.2 hours before departing on the outward leg of 
the last flight.  The typical consumption was 100 litres per hour.  Approximately 102 litres of 
fuel were  removed from the helico pter tank after the accident.  Using that volume, the gross 
                                                        
13 This report refers often to the R44 and R22 because they have  the same main rotor system design as the R66 , 
and have had similar types of accident.   
14 Flapping is the vertical movement of the blade about a hinge perpendicular to the blade span.  The blades flap 
as a normal action throughout each revolution.  Extreme  flapping that can result in a mast bump is not normal.  
15 A low -G condition occurs when an object is subjected to a net vertical force less than the force of gravity.  When 
the vertical force is zero, the object is described as being 'weightless '. 
16 The centre of gravity is the single point in a helicopter through which the weight (or force of gravity) acts.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003 weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident was estimated to have been 756 
kilograms.  The permitted weight range was 635 to 1 ,225 kilograms.  
3.3.9.  The longitudinal centre of gravity was calcul ated to have been 101.8 inches rearward of the 
datum, which was within the allowable range.17  The lateral centre of gravity was within limits.

Flight recorders  
3.3.10.  There was no requirement for the helicopter to be fitted with a flight data recorder, and none 
was fitted.  However, a developmental engine monitoring unit was fitted and it  recorded the 
following parameters once every second:  
 gas producer (compressor) speed  
 power turbine speed  
 torque (the primary indicator of the power being demanded from the engine)  
 measured gas temperature.  
3.3.11.  The recorded  parameters had been  within the fligh t manual limits until the accident.   After 
comparing the accident flight  with previous  flights  that day , Rolls -Royce concluded that the 
engine had been operating normally until the accident  (see Appendix 1 for more details).  
3.3.12.  The Spidertracks unit transmitted  the helicopter's position, altitude, ground  speed and 
heading , nominally every four minutes.18  Therefore , the data gave a coarse approximation of 
the flight path.  The helicopter was approximately 840 feet (256 metres) above ground level at 
the last position transmitted.   The Spidertracks data for all of the flights on 9 March 2013 
indicated that the pilot had complied with the rules for minimum height above ground.  
                                                        
17 The allowable range (given in Imperial units) was 91.0 inches to 102.5 inches .

 3.3.13.  A Garmin 'GPSmap 196' receiver  that used a separate antenna to the Spidertracks unit was 
also fitted to the helicopter.  The Garmin unit , for an undetermined reason, did not record the 
last flight.  However,  the data for the previous flights that day were reviewed.   
3.4. Meteorological information  
3.4.1.  On 9 March 2013 a high pressure system had split into separate centres either side of the 
country and a weak cold front was moving up the North I sland.  The MetService19 aviation 
forecast issued at 0503 for the morning of 9 March 2013 for the Central Platea u area, in 
which the accident site was located, included the following : 
wind at 3 ,000 feet above sea level  140OT 15 k nots 
wind at 5 ,000 feet  130OT 30 k nots, temperature +11  degrees 
Celsius (OC) 
freezing level     14,000 f eet 
areas of broken cloud at 5 ,000, to 9,000 feet e ast of Taupo, but clearing in the 
morning.  Nil significant weather.  
At 1123 the forecast was amended to  add "isolated moderate turbulence20 expected below 
6,000 feet ". 
3.4.2.  The MetService mountain forecast issued at 0435 on 9 March 2013 predicted  southeast 
winds, "strong about and north of the Ruahine Range ".  The Kaweka Range is the next range 
north of the Ruahine Range .  At 1204 MetService amended the  forecast to put the strong 
winds north of the Kaweka Range . 
3.4.3.  Visual meteorological conditions pr evailed , with no rain .  The chief pilot of the operator said 
that at its base the wind had been from the southeast at 10  to 15 k nots.  Over the ranges the 
wind was from the southeast at 15 k nots,  gusting to 25 knots, and stronger to the east .  A 
passenger picked up at 1100 from a hut that was  approximately 15 kilometres south of the 
accident site and 3,000 feet  (914 metres)  above sea level said the air temperature there was 
about 25OC.21 
3.4.4.  Local pilots estimated that t he wind speed at the mountain  tops was about 25 k nots in the 
morning, increasing during the middle of the day and abating that evening.  The chief pilot 
said that when he began searching for the helicopter , the wind was no more than about 15 
knots.  Pilots who had searched  later  said they encountered  moderate turbulence.  A hunter 
who was in the Oamaru River valley  and heard the crash,  said the wind gusts had broke n off 
twigs.  That suggested gusts of more than 34 k nots.22  A video taken by a passenger on an 
earlier flight that day showed small trees at a Mohaka River landing site (approximately 13 
kilometres northeast of the accident site) swaying strongly, which suggested a wind of about 
20 k nots. 
3.5. Wreckage and impact information  
3.5.1.  The wreckage trail was approximately 300 metres long,  across a steep, forested ridge that 
was on the expected route  from the Mangataramea Hut to the operator's base  (see Appendix  
2 for further information on the wreckage ).  The first items in the trail were pieces of Perspex, 
lightweight cabin structure and objects from the cabin .   
3.5.2.  The fuselage, apart from the tail boom and attached tail rotor , had fallen at a steep angle to 
land at the base of a  tree.   The tail boom was caught in the top of another tree.  There was no 
fire. 
                                                        
19 MetService was the certificated provider of aviation meteorological information.  
20 Moderate turbulence is regarded as turbulence that causes: (1) changes in aircraft altitude or attitude; (2) 
variations in indicated airspeed; and (3) aircraft occupants to feel definite strain against seat belts.  
21 The passenger had a wristwatch that sensed air temperature and pressure, but to unknown accurac y. 
22 The Beaufort Wind Scale relates wind speeds to physical effects.  See http://metservice.com/help/help -
warning .

 Final report AO -2013 -003 3.5.3.  One main rotor blade had struck the front right corner of the cabin.  Later examination showed 
that th is blade had fractured completely at approximately two-thirds  span as it bent under the 
forward landing skid cross tube.  Paint transfer marks showed that  the detached outboard 
section of blade had then struck the tail boom while that was still attached to the fuselage.    
3.5.4.  There was clear evidence of a heavy mast bump .23  The main rotor drive shaft was severed 
approximately 15 centimetres below the hub (see F igure 3).  The hub and main rotor blades 
(apart from the separated outboard end of the blade that hit the tail boom) landed 
approximately 300 metres from the fuselage, to the right of the line of flight.  
3.5.5.  Specialists examined the drive shaft fracture, the e ngine and two of its accessories,  and the 
main rotor control hydraulic servos (see Appendix 1).   
3.6. Medical and pathological information  
3.6.1.  A post-mortem examination determined that the pilot had died as a result of multiple injuries.  
The pathologist's report stated that some of the injuries were "indicative of restraint against a 
lap-type seat belt.  The other injuries are likely to have been sustained in a fall from the 
helicopter ". 
3.6.2.  The Commission considered the pathologist's report and noted that there was n o evidence of 
abuse of  alcohol or other commonly screened -for drugs .

 3.7. Survival aspects  
3.7.1.  The search for the accident site took five hours  because  no signal was detected from the 
emergency locator beacon.24  Search pilots said that a fter the accident site had been located, 
they heard in the vicinity a weak signal on frequency 121.5 megahertz .  It was later  found that 
the co-axial antenna cable had separated from the beacon  in the crash.   The Kannad 406 
beacon , serial number 2619364 -0217, had been tested on 21 February 2013  and its battery 
was due for replacement in February 2014.  
3.7.2.  The position reports from the flight tracking unit fitted to the h elicopter  greatly reduced the 
size of the initial search area .  Not all aircraft are fitted with tracking device s, and their 
usefulness depends in part on the selected interval between  position reports.   
3.7.3.  The Commission has previously made recommend ations regarding the  use of flight tracking 
devices and improve ments to  the crashworthiness of emergency locator beacons.25  On 26 
February 2014 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation:  
a. encourage the use of flight tracking devices, espec ially for use in aircraft 
operating in remote areas around New Zealand (005/14)  
b. continue to support the international work underway to improve the crash 
survivability of ELTs and to include GPS information in the data transmitted by 
such devices (006/1 4). 
3.7.4.  On 5th March 2014, the Director replied, in part:  
005/14 - In our draft recommendation response 31 January 2014, the Director 
commented that the CAA provide for the fitment of Flight Tracking Devices (FTDs) 
by operators and this can be achieved in acc ordance with the relevant provisions 
of AC 43 -14. The CAA will continue to encourage operators to fit FTDs in this 
manner. The CAA considers the action sufficient to satisfy the closure of the 
Commission's recommendation.  
006/14 - in the same response let ter, the Director commented that the CAA 
already supports in principle the ICAO and manufacturers' efforts to improve the 
crash survivability of ELTs and accuracy of position reporting. The work is ongoing 
and in this context the CAA requests that the reco mmendation be closed.  
3.8. Organisational and management information  
3.8.1.  The operator was certificated by the CAA to perform air operations under Civil Aviation Rules 
Part 135 , Air Operations - Helicopters and Small Aeroplanes .  The certificate had been  re-
issued on 26 February 2013 . 
3.8.2.  The operator had established  the base at  Poronui Station in 1988 , primarily to fly  hunters and 
fishermen to remote locations  in the Kaimanawa and Kaweka Ranges .  Four pilots were 
employed on a roster basis.  The chief pilot had held th e position since 1996 .  On the day of 
the accident the chief pilot and the accident pilot had shared the flying tasks .  
3.8.3.  The fleet comprised the R66, an R44 and a Hughes 500.  The operator's chief pilot said that 
the lighter weight  and high maximum cruise speed of the R66 were attractive features , and 
training the company's pilots to fly the R66 had been  straightforward  because of the type's 
similarities with the R44 . 
3.9. Special t raining  requirements for pilots  of Robinson helicopters  
3.9.1.  The history of mast bump accident s with the smaller R22 and R44, and the actions taken to 
reduce their incidence , is pertinent to this  R66 investigation, because the three types have the 
same  main rotor system design and a similar response to low G.   In 1996 the NTSB co mpleted  
                                                        
24 An emergency locator beacon transmits a primary signal on 406 meg ahertz for detection by search and rescue 
satellites.  A lower -power, longer -duration secondary signal on 121.5 megahertz is to assist search aircraft to home 
to the site.

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003 a special investigation into R22 mast bump accidents.26  An overview of th at investigation and 
the actions taken by the FAA in response is in Appendix 3.  
3.9.2.  During  the NTSB  investigation  the FAA committed to establishing Flight Standardization 
Board s that would determine  the operational and training requirements for pilots  of future  
helicopter s.27  The requirements were to include any additional knowledge or skills n ecessary 
for a typical pilot to handle the normal and emergency procedures  applicable to a new  type. 
The first Flight Standardization Boards  were established in February 1995 for the R22 and 
R44.  The Boards recognised the knowledge and skill gaps that existed, stating that any 
person who wish ed to operate either type  (FAA, 1995a, p. 7) , (FAA, 1995b, p. 7) : 
should complete a training program designed to enhance awareness of the 
hazards associated with certain characteristics of light helicopters.  Flight 
conducted in normal operat ing conditions may cause an encounter with such 
hazards  [emphasis added].  
3.9.3.  The Boards determined that it was necessary  for R22 and R44 pilots  to understand the effects 
of low G  and how to make a safe recovery  from a low-G condition .  Those topics are releva nt 
for any helicopter with a two -bladed, teetering, underslung rotor system, but in 1995 t hey were 
not in the  helicopter pilot licence training syllab us of the FAA (nor that of th e CAA) .  They have 
since been added to training syllabuses .28 
3.9.4.  To formalise the Boards' determinations , the FAA in March 1995 published Special Federal 
Aviation Regulation No. 73 ( SFAR 73 ), which mandated 'Special Training and Experience 
Requirements' for all pilots of R22 and R44 helicopters, including pilots who were already 
qualified  to fly either  type. 
3.9.5.  On 29 June 2009 the FAA concluded that SFAR 73  should be permanent  for both the R22 and 
the R44 , even though, by then, pilot training syllabuses included the relevant topics .  However,  
in New Zealand the requirement for R44 pilots to have the special training had been 
unintentionally deleted  in 2004 as a result of a CAA  flight manual amendment.29 
3.9.6.  The R66 Flight Standardization Board  considered the relevance of SFAR 73 when it assessed 
the R66.  Its report stated  (FAA, 2010, Part 2, S ection 6) :30 
Of primary concern to the Flight Standardization Board in evaluation of the R66 is 
the published [SFAR 73] specifying training, testing and  checking requirements 
for the R22 and R44.  Because the R66 is a growth variant of the R4 4 and R22 
… the [Board ] elected to evaluate the R66 for operational suitability, specific 
flight characteristics, and specific training, testing and checking requirements for 
pilots.  
3.9.7.  The R66 Flight Standardization Board  confirmed that the awareness topics listed in SFAR 73 
for R22 and R44 pilots applied equally to R66 pilots, by stating (FAA, 2010, Part 1, section 6) : 
Pilot awareness of certain aerodynamic factors with this type of rotor system is 
essential.  This include s awareness of low 'G' operations and recovery 
techniques, rotor blade stall potential, energy management, and low RPM 
recovery techniques.  
                                                        
26 At the time, loss -of-main -rotor -control accidents accounted for more than a third of R22 accidents in the United 
States .  During the special investigation the scope was widened to include similar R44 accidents.  
27 A Flight Standardization Board's  role is distinct from that of the FAA's Aircraft Evaluation Group, whose test pilots 
evaluate the handling characteristics of new helicopters and confirm that they comply with airworthiness 
requirements.  
28 See, for example, Advisory Circular 61-3, www.caa.govt.nz/Advisory_Circulars/AC061_3.pdf , p. 106 and the CAA 
Helicopter Flight Instructor Manual, www.caa.govt.nz/Publications/Other/Heli_Flt_Inst_Manual.pdf , p. 93.  
29 The requirement was reinstated during the course of this inquiry.  See paragraph 3.9.14 .

 3.9.8.  A member of the R66 Flight Standardization Board explained that 'this type of rotor system ' 
meant any two-blade d, teetering, underslung main rotor sy stem.31  However, no similar pilot 
training requirement has been mandated for any other helicopter  manufacturer . 
3.9.9.  The R66 Flight Standardization Board noted th at the R66, R44 and R22 had similar rotor 
designs .  Robinson has described the R66 flight characteristics  as 'substantially similar' to 
those of the R44 .32  Despite that , the Board determined that  there was no need for R66 pilots 
to have the special training or  any minimum flight  experience .  The Board's report stated, in 
part (FAA, 2010, Part 2, Section 6):  
The R66 did not demonstrate unique or unusual handling characteristics in the 
subject areas specified in the SFAR 73 … the R66 does not require specific 
training for unique flight characteristics … R66  inclusion in SFAR 73 is 
inappropriate.  
3.9.10.  In May 2013 Commission investigators conducted a forum with senior helicopter instructors 
and expert staff of the CAA to gain a better understanding of the situation in New Zealand 
regarding the training of Robinson helicopter pilots and the operational experience with the 
helicopters (see Appendix 4). 
3.9.11.  The forum instructors, of whom two had given R66 flight instruction, were of the view that R66 
pilots ought to have the same training and experience requirements as R22 and R44 pilots 
because the rotor design, limitations and response to low G  of the three types were essentially 
the same .  However, a t present, a  trainee helicopter pilot in New Zealand or the United States 
could complete their initial training for a licence on an R66, with no requirement for any 
special training and experience like that mandated for R22 and R44 pilots.   
3.9.12.  Between March 2014 and March 2015, the CAA conducted a review of SFAR 73 in the context 
of the NZ aviation system.  This was in response to a recommendation made by  the 
Commission during an inquiry into an R22 accident  (see footnote 25 ).  The review conclu sions 
included the following:33 
d) …as a result of the similarities of [the R22, R44 and R66] combined with New 
Zealand accident data it is important that R44 and R66 pilots have a clear 
understanding of [the topics  covered  in the Robinson special training]  and 
mitigation strategies  
e) However … there is currently no mechanism for requiring that those flying the 
R44 and R66 have had that training.  
3.9.13.  In April 2015 the CAA issued a consultation document, 'Robinson Helicopter Fleet ', that 
describ ed its proposals for regulatory change to : standardise the conduct, and improve the 
oversight, of the special Robinson training in New Zealand; restore the special training 
requirement for R44 pilots (that had been  inadvertently removed in 2004)34; and to make the 
SFAR 73 special  training applicable to R66 pilots.  
3.9.14.  Following the public consultation of the proposed changes, the Director applied to the Court in 
October 2015 for a Warrant of Authority to Impose Conditions on the operation of R 22 and 
R44 helicopters.  One of the operating conditions  that the Court granted reinstate d SFAR 73 
special  training for New Zealand R44 pilots, with effect from 6 November 2015 . 
3.9.15.  The Director did not apply to the Court for an authority to impose conditions on the operation 
of the R66.  The CAA stated at the time that the Director would monitor the outcome of this 
inquiry and any recommendations that the Commission might make.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  This accident was the first in New Zealand to involve an R66.  It was the fourth fatal R66 
accident globally since the type's certification in 2010, and the second in which the main rotor 
had separated in  flight (see Appendix 5).35  At the time, approximately 300 R66 helicopters 
had been manufactured, with five of them registered in New Zealand.  
4.1.2.  The damage  showed  that a mast bump had preceded  the in-flight break -up.  A mast bump is  
usually  a result of the blades having exceeded the allowable range of flapping.   Robinson 
noted in its Safety Notice SN -11 that "severe in -flight mast bumping usually results in main 
rotor shaft separation and/or rotor blade contact with the fuselage " (Robinson Helicopter 
Company, 2010) . 
4.1.3.  Previous investigations and advice in the Pilot' s Operating H andbook s indicate d that t he 
causal factors of mast bump  accidents involving Robinson helicopters include d: 
 abrupt flight control inputs by a pilot  
 a decrease in the ma in rotor RPM below the allowable flight range  
 a low -G condition.  
4.2. What happened?  
4.2.1.  There was  clear evidence of a severe mast bump and that a main rotor blade had struck  the 
cabin .  The main rotor drive shaft separated under a combination of bending,  torsional  and 
inertial effects, resulting from its  being driven by the engine while the blades were prevented 
from  turning  because they had struck  the fuselage.  
4.2.2.  The recorded engine parameters  (see Appendix 1 ) indicated t hat the engine had been  
operating normally and within limits.  Damage to the engine and attached components 
showed that it was still operating at impact .  The steady engine operation m eant it was very 
unlikely that the mast bump followed a low -rotor -RPM state.  Some minor maintenance 
inconsistencies were identified, but no pre-existing technical defect that could have preceded 
the mas t bump event was found.   Nor was any evidence found of an unusual event, such as 
incapacitation, involving the pilot.  
4.2.3.  The data transm itted by the Spidertracks unit and the recorded global positioning system  
tracks indicated that the pilot had flown the expected flight paths at safe heights.  Based on 
the last data transmitted by the Spidertracks  unit, and witnesses ' observations , the 
environmental and aircraft conditions were assumed to be as follows:  
 altitude:   4,000 feet (1,219 metres)  
 ground speed:   124 k nots 
 track :   033OT 
 air temperature:  15OC 
 wind:    135OT, 20 knots . 
4.2.4.  Using t hese values , the helicopter's i ndicated airspeed was estimated to have been  115 k nots 
shortly before the accident.36,37  The maximum permitted air speed in smooth air under the 
same conditions was 123 k nots.38  Therefore, although relatively high, the airspeed was within 
limits.  
                                                        
35 There have since been three more  fatal R66 accidents, of which one likely  involved a mast bump.  
36 Calculated with an Airtour CRP -5 flight computer (circular slide rule).  
37 Robinson conducted a test flight in Janu ary 2016 under almost identical conditions and recorded an indicated 
airspeed of 118 knots with 75% torque , the approximate power at the time of the accident (see Appendix 1) . 
38 The maximum indicated airspee d was 140 knots for gross weights below 998 kilograms  when at sea level, but it 
reduced with increasing altitude or air temperature.

 4.2.5.  Turbulent conditions persisted all day , with strong wind gusts near t he middle of the day .  The 
conditions were generally as forecast, including the shift  northwards of the area affected by 
strong wind.  Experienced local p ilots who had been flying around the time of the accident, or 
who took part in the search, said conditions were unpleasant.  
4.2.6.  Most of the R66 passengers that day said they had not been both ered by the turbulence and 
had experienced worse conditions , but o ne had commented to the pilot that they were "getting 
knocked around a bit, more than in the Hughes 500 ".  The pilot had agreed and said he would 
have preferred to be in the Hughes.  The chief pilot later said the Hughes was available if the 
pilot had considered it would have been more suitable.  
4.2.7.  The following observations were made by p assengers on four different flights:  
 The seat belt felt tighter as the helicopter en countered a bump . 
 The pilot was "countering gusts, which were mainly sideways rather than vertical ". 
 One noticed the pilot "whack the joystick to the left aggressively " to counter a "lurch to 
one side" as the helicopter came over a ridge (but the other person on that flight did 
not recall that) . 
 The hunters on the flight before the accident said conditions had been  gusty.  
4.2.8.  Moderate turbulence  can result in mo mentary conditions  of low G.  A seat belt feeling tighte r 
during a gust  or bump is consistent with  that effect .  If the pilot had indeed moved the cyclic39 
stick "to the left aggressively ", he w as ver y likely correcting a right roll.   The roll might h ave 
been caused by a gust, but the  helicopter could also roll right if a significant low -G condition  
were  encountered at high speed or with high power .  The right roll is  cause d by the tail rotor 
thrust line acting above the helicopter's centre of gravity.   Robinson cautioned that if an 
uncommanded right roll occur red during a low-G condition, aft cyclic had to be applied before 
applying any left cyclic to stop the roll .  Applying left cyclic first would change the plane of 
rotation of the main rotor blades without the underslung fuselage following, and that risked a 
mast bump.  
4.2.9.  Robinson ha s for a long time recommend ed that pilots reduce airspeed if turbulence is 
encountered , because t he reduced speed (and power) lessen the effect of turbulence and the 
chance of an uncommanded right roll developing .  That advice was contained  in Safety Notice  
SN-32, which was  in the P ilot's Operating Handbook for each  Robinson helicopter type (see 
Appendix 6) .  When it was first issued in 1998, and at the time of this accident, the opening 
sentence of Safety  Notice SN-32 stated:  
Flying in high winds or turbule nce should be avoided . 
That sentence was replaced  in May 2013 (shortly after this accident) with: 
A pilot's improper application of control inputs in response to high winds or 
turbulence can increase the likelihood of a mast bump accident . 
The new sentence  shifted the emphasis  of the safety notice from a dvising pilots to a void 
hazardous weather conditions,  to suggesting that "improper" handling was the cause of mast 
bump  accidents  in high winds and turbulence.   The notice recommended that pilots who 
encount ered turbulence should reduce power and the airspeed to between 60 and 70 k nots if 
the turbulence was "significant ".  It also stated  that pilots should not over -control,  but 
removed the  earlier  advice to "avoid large or abrupt control movements ".  The revi sed notice  
added th at a light ly-loaded helicopter was more susceptible to turbulence.  
4.2.10.  In February 2016 Robinson revised  Safety Notice SN-32 again;  restoring the advice to avoid 
flight in high winds or turbulence , and emphasising the need to reduce speed if turbulence 
was encountered while operating at light -weight (see paragraph 6.4 and Appendix 7).  
                                                        
39 The cyclic stick is one of two main rotor controls.  Movement of the cyclic stick causes the rotor blade pitch 
angles to change, which causes the rotor 'disc' to tilt in the same direction in which the pilot has put the stick.  The 
helicopter then moves in  that direction. This can be sideways, forwards or backwards (aft) or any other direction.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 4.2.11.  The weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident was estimated to have been 756 
kilograms, which was at the light end of the allowable range of 635 to 1 ,225 kilograms.  The 
airspeed about 30 seconds before the accident was  approximately 115 k nots, well above the 
recommended speed of 60 to70 knots for 'significant' turbulent conditions . 
4.2.12.  The statements of w itness es on earlier flights and in other helicopters  indicate d that  it was 
very likely the helicopter  encountered moderate  or greater  turbulence  on the return trip when 
the accident occurred .  The light weight , and possibly a relatively high speed , would have 
exacerbated the effect of the turbulence.  If the pilot had reacted to the turbulence with an 
inappropriate flight control  input  - for example, an abrupt input, or by applying left cyclic in 
response to a right roll when experiencing  low G  - that could have caused  the mast bump and 
the main rotor blade contact with the fuselage.  
Finding s 
1. The in-flight break -up was caused by a mast bump and main rotor blade 
contact with the fuselage . 
2. The mast bump very likely occurred when the helicopter encounter ed 
moderate or greater  turbulence , which likely resulted in a condition of low G.  
The effect of any turbulence would have been exacerbated by the helicopter's 
light weight and  estimated  airspeed  of 115 knots . 
3. The possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot 
contributed to the mast bump cannot be excluded.  
4.3. Safety issues  
4.3.1.  While it was very likely that turbulence and  the helicopter 's speed and weight  contributed to 
the accident , the Commission also identified the following safety issues:  
 four of the seven fatal R66 accidents that have occurred globally since the type was 
introduced into service in 2010  were mast bump or low -main -rotor -RPM accidents, 
accident types seen with the smaller R22 and R44, which have the same  main r otor 
design .40  However, the R66 was certificated without any special pilot training 
requirements  or operating restrictions such as the minimum pilot experience and 
maximum wind strength  that apply to the R22  
 the flight manuals for Robinson helicopters d id not adequately warn pilots of the 
hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a 
catastrophic mast bump  
 earlier research into the flight control systems and dynamic behaviour of the main rotor 
of lightweight helicopt ers, such as  the design used by Robinson, was not completed as 
intended.  Until the behaviour of such rotor system s in conditions of low G and 
turbulence  is fully understood, it is possible that not all of the causal factors of mast 
bump accidents will be identified . 
4.3.2.  These issues, and some observations about CAA audits , are discussed  below.  
  
                                                        
40 As of 24 November 2015, more than 650 R66 helicopters had been delivered.

 4.4. Certification process for  the R66  
4.4.1.  A general requirement for the certification of a light helicopter ( or 'rotorcraft') was that a pilot 
of average skill must be able to take off, climb, turn, land and otherwise manoeuvre the 
helicopter without any danger of over -stressing it.  Federal Aviation  Regulation (FAR) Part 27 
stated this requirement as follows:  
§27.1 41   General .  
The rotorcraft must —… 
(b) Be able to maintain any required flight condition and make a smooth 
transition from any flight condition to any other flight condition without 
exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength, and without danger o f exceeding 
the limit load factor under any operating condition probable for the type.  
4.4.2.  The FAA advised that the 'required flight conditions' and 'operating conditions probable for the 
type' meant typical flight manoeuvres, not environmental  conditions .  The only environmental 
considerations relevant to FAR 27.141 were the altitude and temperature ranges in which the 
manufacturer expected the helicopter to operat e.  Another FAR41 considered the effect s of 
wind , but only in regard to the helicopter's controllability wh en hovering.   
Helicopter response to low G  
4.4.3.  Since th e R66 was certificated in 2010, the flight man ual Limitations section has contained  
the following caution against making control inputs that could cause a low G condition and 
result in a mas t bump:  
CAUTION  
A pushover (forward cyclic maneuver) performed from level 
flight or following a pull -up causes a low -G (near weightless) 
condition which can result in catastro phic loss of lateral control 
… 
4.4.4.  Turbulence can also cause a  hazardous low-G condition .  However, turbulence, unlike altitude 
and temperature, is a n environmental condition that cannot be predicted or controlled under 
test conditions.  The FAA advised that the only consideration of a helicopter's behaviour in 
turbulence was the te st pilot's qualitative assessment of the amount of cyclic control available 
to overcome a moderate gust.42  As two -bladed, teetering main rotor systems like that used by 
Robinson were  not intended for low-G flight, the FAA did not consider low G to be an 'o perating 
condition probable for the type'.  Therefore,  the R66 certification programme was not required 
to test the helicopter's response to low G.   
4.4.5.  Some turbulence is not uncommon when flying, and prudent flying suggests that it ought to be 
anticipated  in mountainous areas.  The New Zealand experience is that mast bump  accidents 
are more likely to occur in mountainous terrain .  Although  turbulence is not an operating 
condition contemplat ed by FAR 27.141 , it is a normal operating hazard .  A low-G conditio n, 
which  can result  from turbulence,  is one of the hazards  that the Flight Standardization Boards 
included in the special training  for the R22 and R44 . 
4.4.6.  Following the Kaweka R66 accident, a very experienced New Zealand helicopter instructor 
reported having been surprise d when an R66 rolled at a high rate in a low (but positive) G 
condition.  When the FAA was asked whether this characteristic was seen during the R66 
certification programme, it replied it had not, stating:43  
Right roll characteristics were not  described in any certification flight test reports 
released to the Fort Worth [Aircraft Evaluation Group] or the [Flight 
Standardization Board] for the R66.   Uncommanded right roll did not manifest 
itself during any maneuvers specified in the [Practical T est Standards] during

 Final report AO -2013 -003 performance of the [Flight Standardization Board], nor in any of the certification 
flight test conducted by the [Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office] (LACO).  
4.4.7.  A representative of the FAA Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office confirmed that the general 
flight characteristics tested during the R66 certification had not specifically consider ed the 
type's response to low G.44  Yet Robinson considered that t he various R66 certification flight 
tests had include d "every likely manoeuvre to be performed in service, including manoeuvres 
that exceeded flight limitations ", a reference to push -over (low-G) manoeuvres  that were 
otherwise prohibited for all three Robinson types.  
4.4.8.  The lowest recorded G during the certification flight tes ts was +0.4 G (Robinson Helicopter 
Company, 2014, p. 3.18) .  That became the target minimum G for the R66 Main Rotor 
Flapping Angle Survey  conducted in May 2014, one year and two months a fter the Kaweka 
accident  and more  than three years after the R66 Flight Standardization Board met .  That 
survey recorded a minimum G of +0.33 (Robinson Helicopter Company, 2014, p. 4.7) . 
4.4.9.  Although the FAA stated that none of its test pilots had encountered uncommanded right roll 
during the R66 certification  programme  and that Robinson had not provided any evidence to 
the FAA of this characteristic, videos of the rotor flapping survey flights  showed that roll does 
occur  with low G .  However , in each case the test pilot initiated recovery action as soon as the 
anticipated roll began . The survey showed that the R66 responds to low G in the same way as 
the R22 and R44.  
Main r otor blade to fuselage clearance  
4.4.10.  Robinson's Safety Notice SN-11 noted that a sever e mast bump could  lead to main rotor blade 
contact with the fuselage .  A catastrophic accident is almost inevitable  after blade contact .  It 
is obvious that the main ( and tail) rotor s must remain clear of the helicopter structure  under  
all operational conditions . That requirement is covered by the following certification 
requirement : 
§27.661    Rotor blade clearance.  
There must be enough clearance between the rotor blades and other parts of the 
structure to prevent the blades from striki ng any part of the structure during any 
operating condition.  
4.4.11.  Following the NTSB's special investigation into R22 mast bump and low -main -rotor -RPM 
accidents, of which  most  involved a main rotor blade striking the fuselage, the NTSB  stated 
that it was concer ned that "other highly responsive helicopters are likely to be designed and 
built that may have characteristics similar to the R22 " and that "there is a need for the FAA to 
consider the responsiveness of helicopters (especially lightweight, high performanc e 
helicopters such as the R22) as part of the certification process " (NTSB, 1996, p. 27) .  As a 
result of this concern, the NTSB  recommended in 1996 that the FAA:  
Require helicopter manufacturers to provide data on the response of helicopters 
to flight control inputs to be used as part of the certification process, and require 
operational limitations or other measures for those helicopters that are highly 
responsive ( recommendation A-96-11). 
4.4.12.  The NTSB changed the status o f that recommendation to 'Closed - Acceptable  Action ' in 2000 
after the FAA stated that its rev ised guidance to manufacturers addressed large control inputs 
by pilots and low-G manoeuvres  that may affect blade -fuselage clearance45 [emphasis added].  
4.4.13.  The R66 has the same main  rotor design and some similar flight characteristics to the R22 
and the R44 , and t he R66 certification programme took advantage of these similarities.  For 
example, the FAA a ccepted the results of the earlier R44 rotor flapping survey as 
complementary evidence that the R66 met the certification blade  clearance requirement.   
Robinson explained the rationale for that approach :46

 Compliance with 14 CFR 27.661 was demonstrated in conjunction with flight 
testing for demonstration of compliance with the flight requirements of 14 CFR 
Part 27, and in -flight strain measurements for demonstration of compliance with 
the fatigue requirements of §27.571 …  
The maneuvers included in the flight tests … are considered to include every 
likely maneuver to be performed in service, including maneuvers that exceed 
flight limitations.   The main rotor flight strain survey included push -over 
maneuvers that induced low -g conditions similar to those documented in the 
[R66] Main Rotor Flapping Angle Survey report (RTR 673) [see paragraph  
4.4.7 ].  While the results of these flight tests did not include measurements of 
blade clearance, the absence of any unusual blade behavior in the course of the 
flight tests was considered sufficient for demonstration of compliance with  
§27.661.  
As the flight characteristics and geometry of the R66 are substantially similar to 
those of the R44, and comprehensive blade clearance data was available for the 
R44 indicating blade clearance margins are large, direct measurements of blade 
clear ance were not considered necessary for the R66.  
4.4.14.  The FAA considered the R66 main rotor flapping survey to have confirmed th at th e type 
compli ed with rotor clearance requirements.  The Robinson  survey report concluded:  
Based on the test data in this report, it is clear that the R66 rotor system will not 
stall, exceed teeter limits, or allow blade contact with the airframe when the 
aircraft is flown within the approved operating envelope (Robinson Helicopter 
Company, 2014, p. 4.2 8).47 
4.4.15.  While t he R66 rotor flapping survey demonstrated rotor  clearance and that the helicopter had 
an acceptable response to control reversals  (a form of abrupt controlling) , the report made the 
following comments that  illustrate d a difference between test flying and what an average pilot 
might experience, and that flight test results might not be transferable between similar types : 
Although control reversal flight characteristics may be similar between Robinson 
models, small changes in airspeed and pilot technique may produce large 
changes in flight characteristics and component loads during the maneuver …  
While control reversals we re performed during the original R66 certification 
program, they were generally performed quickly enough such that rapid roll rates 
were not generate d (Robinson Helicopter Company, 2014, p. 3.13) . 
Although low G flight c haracteristics may be similar between Robinson models, 
the exact boundary between 'safe recovery can be performed' and catastrophic 
mast bumping cannot be predicted .  Small changes in entry speed and pilot 
technique may produce large changes in roll rates  (Robinson Helicopter 
Company, 2014, p. 3.19)  [emphasis added].  
4.4.16.  This acknowledged fine line between safe and unsafe outcomes clearly illustrates the hazard 
a low-G condition  poses for a Robinson helicopter.  F light in mod erate or greater turbulence  
can result in a low G condition, which means flight in turbulence is a risk that needs be 
mitigated .  It also brings into question another conclusion in the Robinson blade flapping 
survey report : that the rotor system will not allow blade contact with the fuselage when the 
helicopter is flown within the approved limits .  This issue is discussed in section  4.6. 
Summary of certification issue  
4.4.17.  The R66 certification programme was not required to test the helicopter's response to low G , 
in spite of low G being known to present a serious risk of mast bump for the  R22 and R44.  
Robinson  stated that  the R66 certification flights included manoeuvres that induced low-G 
conditions similar to those in the main  rotor flapping survey, but the effects , if any,  were not 
documented .  The rotor flapping survey videos confirmed that the R66 respond ed to low G in 
the same way as the R22 and R44 .  For all three types, an incorrect pilot reaction to an 
uncommanded roll c ould result in  a catastrophic mast bump.  
                                                        
47 The operating, or flight, envelope is the range of speed, load factor  and altitude for an aircraft, as established by 
the design and verified during certification testing .

 Final report AO -2013 -003 4.4.18.  The similarity of the three Robinson types in their response to low G shows a need for similar 
knowledge and skill requirements for the pilots of any of the types. The Flight Standardization 
Boards for all three Robinson types considered that it was essential for pilots to have an 
understanding of the helicopter s' response to l ow G , but the R66 Board declined to require 
special training for R66 pilots.48    
4.4.19.  Therefore , at present , a person with no prior piloting exp erience can train for a helicopter pilot 
licence on the R66.  The Flight Standardization Board  expected R66 pilots to have the same 
essential knowledge regarding Robinson flight and handling characteristics as pilots of the 
R22 and R44, but no special training was mandated  for the R66 .49  Insufficient pilot 
knowledge and experience has been indicated as  a likely factor in the South Dakota and 
Colombia R66 accidents  (see Appendix 5) . 
4.4.20.  Pilots (like the pilot in this accident) who are qualified to fly the R22 or  R44 could infer from 
the lack of any special training for the R66 that the R66 does not require the same careful 
handling as the smaller types.  The emerging accident trend and instructional experience to 
date suggest that the R66 does require the same ca reful handling.  
4.4.21.  This accident and many others reinforce the need for pilots of Robinson helicopters , including 
the R66,  to understand fully the need for careful handling to avoid low G , have  a clear 
appreciation of the danger of flight in turbulent conditi ons, which can also cause low G , and 
understand the importance of reducing airspeed if turbulence is encountered.  
4.4.22.  When the R66 Flight Standardization Board met, the type had not entered operational service.  
The R66 accident history to date indicates that the Boards ' decision not to recommend an 
extension of SFAR 73 to R66 pilots should be re considered .  The Commission is 
recommending  that the Administrator of the FAA extend the knowledge and training 
requirements of SFAR 73 to pilots of the R66.50 
4.4.23.  Following  a review of Robinson safety training in New Zealand, t he CAA issued a consultation 
document outlining its intention to require pilots to complete, in essence, the SFAR 73 training 
as part of  an R66 type rating, and also its intention to reinstate the SFAR  73 training for R44 
pilots.  Following industry consultation, the Director of Civil Aviation (the Director) obtained 
Court authority to reinstate the SFAR 73 training for the R44, but no application was made to 
the Court in respect of the R66 .  Therefore , the Commission is recommending that the D irector  
require pilots to complete the SFAR 73 training , or an equivalent  requirement, as a 
prerequisite for the issue of an R66 type rating.  
Findings  
4. The R66 global accident history , in the five years since the ty pe was introduced 
into service in 2010 , suggests that the R66 is as vulnerable as the smaller 
R22 and R44 to a catastrophic mast bump  under certain conditions . 
5. The R66 was certificated without any special  pilot training requirements to 
mitigate the risk of a catastrophic mast bump . 
 
4.5. Flight manual reference s to hazardous practices and conditions  
4.5.1.  The available information on the fatal R66 accidents to date suggested that not all of the  
involved  pilots had flown the smaller R22 or R44  and received the SFAR 73 training applicable 
to those types .  But  even those pilots who did have R22 or R44 experience were unable to  
avoid their  accident s.

 4.5.2.  If a flight condition is so critical that any exceedance could be catas trophic, such as the low G 
pushover de scribed in paragraph 4.4.3, the flight manual  should contain an explicit  'warning' , 
using  the terminology  that has become standard in aviation and other technical industr ies.51  
The FAA guidelines recommended the use of  'warning' if there was a risk of death or injury, 
and use d 'caution' for situations with a risk of equipment damage.52  However, Robinson's 
flight manuals follow ed the United States General Aviation Manufacturers Association 's 
Specification No.1, which did  not define 'warnings', 'cautions' and 'notes'.   Instead, Robi nson 
defined 'caution' to include the risk of death or injury as well as equipment damage . 
4.5.3.  Robinson provide d good, plain -language guidance for various aspects of flight operations, in 
the Safety Tips and Notices section  of the Pilot's Operating Handbook s.  For example, Safety 
Notice SN -32, High Winds or Turbulence ( see Appendix 6) contain ed critical information  to 
help pilots avoid mast bumps.  The information deserved  to be headed 'Warning' , because a 
mast bump would likely be catastrophic.  However, the safety notices w ere not a part of the 
FAA-approv ed flight manual.  Therefore,  apart from the conditional limits in airworthiness 
directive 95 -26-04 for the R22, there was no referenc e to turbulence in any FAA-approved 
Robinson flight manual  at the time of this accident.  
4.5.4.  Since 2008, in addition to this accident, the Commission has inquired into two R22 and one 
R44 mast bump accidents, in circumstances where turbulence was a factor.  Th e CAA has also 
investigated another two R22 accidents of this sort in that period.  
4.5.5.  For this reason , the Commission disagree d with an industry view, expressed at  the May 2013 
flight instructors' forum , that th e lack of an explicit warning about the sensitivity of Robinson 
helicopters to turbulence  was not a safety  issue .  The accident record indicate d that it is an 
issue and that the hazard  should be explicitly s tated  and appropriate mitigation put in place . 
4.5.6.  In January 2015 Robinson increased the a ttention given to the hazard of turbulence by adding 
the following Caution to  the Normal Procedures sections  of the R66 (and R44) flight manuals:  
CAUTION  
 If turbulence is expected, reduce power  
 and use a slower than normal cruise speed.  
4.5.7.  Each pilot of an aircraft shall, before beginning a flight, be familiar with the aircraft flight 
manual.53  That requires pilots  to be aware of any changes to the manual.  Amendments are 
normally notified by manufacturers to registered owners of the aircraft type and to sub scribers 
to an amendment notification service for the type.  The full, current content of each Robinson 
Pilot's Operating Handbook is  also freely available on -line. 
4.5.8.  The addition of the above Caution to the Robinson R66 and R44 flight manuals, and the 
chang es made in February 2016 to Safety Notice SN -32, ha s significantly increased the 
attention given to the hazard of turbulence and could help reduce the incidence of mast 
bumps , provided pilots are made aware of and understand the significance of this important 
information .  Given the critical importance these latest 'Cautions' published by Robinson 
helicopters  have for improving the safety of Robinson helicopter flight safety in New Zealand , 
the Commission consider s these changes warrant wider publicit y within New Zealand .  
Accordingly, the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he promptly 
publicise the changes to the New Zealand helicopter community.  
4.5.9.  In April 2015 the Commission recommended that the Administrator of the FAA requ ire 
Robinson to use the term ' warning' for those operating conditions and practices that involve a 
risk of personal injury or loss of life.54  On 1 7 November 2015 t he FAA replied that Robinson 
flight manuals included a definition of 'Caution' that was a com bination of the traditional 
                                                        
51 This issue was discussed in Commission inquiry report 11 -003, in -flight break -up, ZK -HMU, Robinson R22, near 
Mount Aspiring, 27 April 2011; and inquiry report 13 -005, in -flight loss of control, Robinson R22, ZK -HIE, near New 
Plymouth, 30 March 2013.

54 Recommendation 007/15, in inquiry report 13 -005.   

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003 (industry practice) definitions of Warning and Caution.  The FAA believed "there would be little 
added value in having Robinson change its flight manuals" and therefore it considered the 
recommendation "Closed Not Adopted".  
Finding 
6. At the time of the accident, t he Robinson helicopter flight manuals d id not 
adequately warn  pilots  of the hazardous operating practices and 
environmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump .  
This type of accident is strongly associated with turbulen t conditions . 
4.6. Dynamic behaviour of the Robinson main rotor system   
4.6.1.  The R66 main rotor flapping survey report, like that for the R44 and the earlier FAA special 
certification reviews of the R22  (see Appendix 3) , concluded that the r otor system will not 
allow blade contact with the fuselage when the helicopter is flown within the approved limits .   
Investigations into in-flight break -up accidents , which typically show evidence of a mast bump,  
have rarely proven  that the pilots  mishand led the helicopter or exceeded the flight manual 
limits .  Causal factors other than pilot handling and the operating environment may have been 
involved.  Therefore, p reventive actions other than pilot training , operational limitations  and 
flight manual clarit y may be required.  
4.6.2.  The recommendation made in 1996 by the NTSB to the FAA to examine the design and the 
dynamic behaviour of the Robinson main rotor  (as the exemplar lightweight rotor system)  for 
any possible contribution to  such  accidents was closed before the research was completed.   
The Georgia Institute of Tech nology  found  in their theoretical study  that "gusts under 
moderate conditions seem not to be a problem ", but they recommend ed further study of the 
problem  (see Appendix 3,  paragraph 10).  The lack of exact knowledge on the dynamics of 
main rotor blade behaviour persists.  
4.6.3.  The introduction to the FAA's airworthiness directive  95-26-04 (for the R22) inferred that the 
FAA anticipated corrective design changes to reduce or elimi nate this type of accident.  The 
airworthiness directive stated, in part:  
Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions and aircraft 
characteristics that lead to main rotor blade / fuselage contact accidents, and 
corrective type design changes a nd operating limitations are identified …  
4.6.4.  Robinson made c hanges to the engine controls to reduce the risk of low rotor RPM, but the 
main rotor system design  remains unchanged .  The NTSB special investigation "found no 
direct evidence of an unstable blade or rotor system design.  The extensive operational 
history, the wreckage evidence, flight tests, and computer simulations indicate that a 
dynamically unstable [R22] main rotor system is unlikely " (NTSB, 1996, p. 25) .  The NTSB 
recognised that there could be other  explanations for the accidents.  
4.6.5.  The avoidance of conditions that might cause a main rotor to strike the fuselage  relies 
primarily  on pilots maintain ing the correct rotor RPM , and their diligent observ ance of  the 
prohibition against deliberate low G and the caution to "avoid abrupt control inputs ".  Pilots 
should learn w hat constitutes an 'abrupt'  control input during their initial training .  The NTSB 
noted that the 1995 flight test s of the R44 rotor flapping  angles "were not (and could not 
safely be) conducted to determine the helicopter's response to large, abrupt cyclic inputs " and 
"the flight test did not provide the data needed to determine the mechanism for the blade 
diverging into the body " (NTSB, 1996, p. 23) . 
4.6.6.  Post-certification flight testing of the R22 (in 1982) and the R44 (1995) by Robinso n and the 
FAA concluded that each  helicopter  was safe when "flown within its approved limitations " and 
"could safely perform any nominal flight activity without main rotor divergence tendencies " 
(NTSB, 1996, p. 23) .  However,  a helicopter could be  operating within the approved limits , but 
unintentionally exceed a design limitation without a pilot input ; for example , when  
encountering low G or in turbulence . The R22 and R44 Flight Standardization Boards in 1995 
  
Final rep ort AO -2013003 
<< Page 23 >>
 noted that "flight conducted in normal operating conditions may cause an encounter with such 
hazards ". 
4.6.7.  Robinson submitted that turbulence alone cannot  lead to low G mast bump ing, adding that  an 
improper input or reaction by the pilot was also required .  Although it is clear from operational 
experience that Robinson helicopters can be operated safely in some degree of turbulence, 
the Commission considers  that Robinson h as not proven conclusively that a pilot input is 
necessary  for a mast bump , for the following reasons:  
 The rotor system behaviour in turbulence has not been fully teste d. 
 The low G  conditions that have been tested were  planned manoeuvres as part of  
blade flapping surveys.  In those tests, the test pilot initiated recovery action 
immediately the helicopter began the expected right roll , thereby avoiding any 
subsequent dynamic response . 
 No minimum G is specified for Robinson helicopters, and little cognisance is given to 
the counter -intuitive response required of a pilot (who is unlikely to be  a test pilot) 
faced with an un -commanded right roll under low G. 
 Many of the fatal Robinson mast bump accidents in N ew Zealand  have occurred in 
turbulent conditions, and it was impossible to state what control inputs were or might 
have been  made  immediately prior to  the mast bumps.   
4.6.8.  The critical and sensitive nature of the flight controls was made cle ar in the R66 rotor flapping 
survey report , which stated  "the exact boundary between 'safe recovery can be performed ' 
and catastrophic mast bumping cannot be predicted ".  Studies by the NTSB and 
manufacturers have shown that , due to the relative movement o f the main rotor blades and 
the fuselage  during manoeuvres, the required separation can be lost completely  in less than a 
second .  All of the conditions that can lead to a Robinson main rotor blade striking the 
fuselage have not been  fully explained, but it is too dangerous to  explore the problem  with 
flight tests .  Until the dynamic behaviour of the rotor system under conditions of low G is fully 
understood, it is likely that not all of the causal factors in accidents of this type will be 
identified, and therefore the appropriate recommendations to prevent a recurrence might not 
be made.  
4.6.9.  Since 1995, computational sciences and aerospace e ngineering have advanced to such a 
degree that a fuller  understanding of the dynamic behaviour of lightweight, teetering,  
underslung rotor systems ought to be possible.   For example, instrumented, remotely 
controlled  helicopter s could provide data on the rotor behaviour under conditions  that are too 
dangerous for test pilots .  Such a project could help  to eliminat e mast bump  accidents.  
4.6.10.  Therefore , the Commission is recommending that the Administrator of the FAA r einstate 
research into the dynamic behaviour of two-bladed, teetering, underslung rotor systems, 
taking full advantage of the technology now available, with the aim of  achieving the intended 
goals of NTSB recommendation A -96-12. 
Finding  
7. There is insufficient industry  knowledge of why Robinson helicopters are 
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 4.7. Civil Aviation Authority  audit s 
4.7.1.  The pilot  was effectively making his own operational decisions because he flew alone, but he 
was still under the close supervision of the chief pilot .  The operator was required to have a 
training programme that ensured its pilots were competent to perform their as signed duties.55  
The relevant  advisory circular, 119-3, specified that the programme should include a 
mountain flying element if the area of operations included mountainous terrain.  Most of the 
operator's work was in a designated mountainous area.  
4.7.2.  The CAA issued a specific  approval to persons and certificated training organisations who 
could conduct advanced mountain training.  Neither the operator nor its authorised flight 
training provider held that approval.  
4.7.3.  An operator's training programme could  be varied, but the reason had to be noted in the 
affected pilot's training record.  The operator's records did not show that the pilot in this case 
had completed or been excused from mountain flying training relevant to his role.  However, 
the training re cords did show that he had been supervised over most of the operator's routes 
and into most landing sites, including the Mangatarame a Hut.  The chief pilot explained that  
those flights had included demonstration s of and discussion s about mountain flying 
procedures , as had the pilot's R66 type rating training and his initial competency check with 
the external flight examiner .  Although the operator's records did not show that the pilot had 
been given  mountain flying training specific to the role, it is highl y likely that he had  receiv ed 
such training .  Therefore , the Commission determine d that the pilot's training  was unlikely to 
have been a factor in the accident.  
4.7.4.  The safety of the New Zealand civil aviation system relies, in part, on the effectiveness and 
reliability of the CAA's risk -based surveillance system .  The p rimary tools in this system 
include d the routine audits and spot checks of operators' adherence to the standards and 
conditions of their aviation documents.  The focus of the audits is "on what is actually 
happening versus the procedures that the organisation has documented to show how it 
carries out its activities " (CAA, 2012, p. 8) . 
4.7.5.  The CAA conducted a routine audit of the operator in March 2010.  The operator was re-
certified in February 2013, two weeks before the accident.   
4.7.6.  A further routine audit was conducted in  March 2014 .  The report of that  audit , in line with the 
CAA's policy , contained  no commentary by the auditors on the operator's performance or 
relat ive safety risk .  The report included a summary of approximately 480 rules (or sections of 
rules) "that were tested during this audit ", all of which were  ticked to show that the operator 
was "found to b e compliant ".  The size of the list was so inordinatel y large for an audit as to 
call into question the integrity of the audit.   The CAA later agreed56 that:  
this audit report is unlikely to portray an accurate representation of the rules 
sampled … staff are now more conscious of the expectation and importance  of 
only marking off the rules that were checked.  
4.7.7.  The Surveillance Risk Assessment Form prepared prior to that audit had a recommendation, 
made on 20 February 2014 by the CAA unit manager, for auditors to "conduct an in -depth 
audit of the [operator's] pilot training and competency programme " and to "review the 
company's approach to mountain flying training ".  These were  appropriate instructions  to 
make  following the Kaweka accident.  The post -audit report stated that the operator's 
exposition57 complied with Rule 135.553(a) regarding training programmes .  However, the 
Commission 's staff  found  no reference to mountain flying training in the exposition  as late as 
July 2015.  As a result of the Commission asking for this anomaly to be explained , the CAA in 
August 2015 asked  the operator to submit a revised training programme.

 4.7.8.  Regardless  of the audit errors, the  Commission determined that the pilot's training , and 
specifically his training for mountain flying,  was unlikely to have been a factor in the accident.   
Findings  
8. In spite of the lack of reference in the operator's exposition to mountain flying 
training, the  pilot's training was unlikely to hav e been a factor in the accident.  
  

<< Page 26 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003 5. Findings  
5.1. The in -flight break -up was caused by a mast bump and main rotor blade contact with the 
fuselage.  
5.2. The mast bump very likely occurred when the helicopter encountered moderate or greater 
turbulence, which likely resulted in a condition of low G.  The effect of any turbulen ce would 
have been exacerbated by the helicopter's light weight and  estimated  airspeed  of 115 
knots . 
5.3. The possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot contributed to the 
mast bump cannot be excluded.  
5.4. The R66 global accident hist ory, in the five years since the type was introduced into service 
in 2010 , suggests that the R66 is as vulnerable as the smaller R22 and R44 to a 
catastrophic mast bump  under certain conditions . 
5.5. The R66 was certificated without any special  pilot training r equirements to mitigate the risk 
of a catastrophic mast bump . 
5.6. At the time of the accident, t he Robinson helicopter flight manuals d id not adequately warn 
pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can lead 
rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump .  This type of accident is strongly associated with 
turbulen t conditions . 
5.7. There is insufficient industry  knowledge of why Robinson helicopters are particularly 
vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events.  
5.8. In spite of the lack of refe rence in the operator's exposition to mountain flying training, the 
pilot's training was unlikely to have been a factor in the accident .

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. In January 2015, the following was added to the Normal Procedures section of the R66 (and 
R44) fli ght manuals:  
CAUTION  
If turbulence is expected, reduce power  
and use a slower than normal cruise speed.  
6.3. On 29 October 2015, the Director of Civil Aviation was granted a Warrant of Authority to 
Impose Conditions on the operation of Robinson R22 and R44 helicopters  in New Zealand .  
The conditions included re instate ment of the  SFAR 73 training for R44 pilots .  For the full list 
of conditions, see https:/www.caa.govt.nz/pilots/robinson_conditions.pdf   
6.4. In February 2016, Robinson amended Safety Notice SN-32, 'High winds or turbulence' .  One of 
the changes reinstated  the previous advice that 'flying in high winds or turbulence should be 
avoided'  (see Appendix 7) .   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.5. Nil.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may  issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider trans port 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Director of Civil Aviation (New 
Zealand) and to the Administrator of the F AA (United States) . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemente d without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. The CAA adopted the requirements of SFAR 73 for both the R22 and the R44 when the SFAR  
was first issued in 1995 .  The FAA made SFAR 73  permanent in 2009 , for both  R44 and R22  
pilots . 
7.4. The R66 main rotor system is the same design as those  of the R22 and R44 .  Therefore, and 
with the knowledge that four of seven fatal R66 accidents to date have been mast bump or 
low-main -rotor -RPM accidents, the 'essential' aerodynamic and handling knowledge and 
training that are prescribed in SFAR 73 for R22 and R44 pilots should be thoroughly 
understood and observed by R66 pilots .  This goal would be achieved by the FAA extending  
SFAR 73 to include R66 pilots .  It would be appropriate for t he CAA to take that action, 
regardless of the FAA's response.  
7.5. The addition to the Robinson R66 (and R44) flight manuals, in January 2015, of a Caution 
concerning flight in turbulence, and the changes made in February 2016 to Safety Notice SN -
32, significantly increased the attention given to turbulence.  Although the  changes w ould 
have been notified to most registered owners of Robinson helicopters and subscribe rs to an 
amendment notification service, and are available on the Robin son website, their wider 
publication could help reduce the incidence of mast bump accide nts in New Zealand . 
7.6. The inherent risks involved with flight testing lightweight helicopters with two -bladed, 
teetering, underslung rotor systems have precluded a full understanding of how the main rotor 
dynamics might have contributed to mast bump  accident s.  Mathematical modelling  about 20 
years ago made a contribution to this knowledge , but the model was not completely validated .  
Advances in technology  since then , including the use of remotely piloted helicopters,  provide 
an opportunity to comp lete this research . 
To the Director of Civil Aviation  
7.7. On 25 February 2016  the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he : 
7.7.1.  Include the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No.  
73, or an equivalent requirement,  as a prerequisite for the issue of a Robinson R66 type 
rating . (002/16 ). 
On 8 March 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority replied in part:  
On the basis that the FAA has twice rejected the inclusion of the Robinson R66 
model in SFAR 73, the Direct or will not implement the recommendation, but will 
continue to monitor advice from Robinson Helicopters and the FAA with respect 
to the operation of R66 helicopters.  
7.7.2.  Promptly publicise the recent changes to the Robinson R66 (and R44) Pilot's Operating 
Handbooks that caution against flight in high winds and turbulence , and which advise pilots 
to reduce power and speed if turbulence is expected or encountered  (011/16).  
 
  
Final rep ort AO -2013003 
<< Page 29 >>
 On 1 April 2016 , the Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The Director does not consider  it necessary to promptly publicise the recent 
changes to the Robinson R66 (and R44) Pilot's Operating Handbooks that 
caution against flight in high winds and turbulence, and which advises pilots to 
reduce power and speed if turbulence is expected or encou ntered.  
The amended safety notice by Robinson is freely available on their website.  In 
addition, operators of Robinson helicopters are required to regularly amend their 
Pilot's Operating Handbooks and this activity includes incorporating changes to 
inform ation such as safety notices.  
To the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration.  
7.8. On 25 February 2016  the Commission recommended to the Administrator, F AA that he:  
7.8.1.  Extend the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No.  
73 to pilots of the Robinson R66 helicopter . (004/16 ) 
7.8.2.  Reinstate research into the dynamic behaviour of two-bladed, teetering, underslung rotor 
systems, taking full advantage of available  technology, with the aim of achieving the original 
goal of NTSB reco mmendation A -96-12. (005/16) 
On 9 June 2016, the FAA replied:  
The FAA received this safety recommendation on May 4, 2016.  We are 
evaluating the recommendation and will propose an action plan, if appropriate.  
We will coordinate with Robinson Helicopters during this process and provide an 
update by August 1, 2016.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Pilots must be familiar with the complete Pilot's Operating Handbook for each  aircraft type 
that they fly, as well as  the approved flight manuals.  
8.2. Pilots of Robinson helicopters, regardless of their experience, should avoid  areas of high winds 
or turbulence, and closely adhere to the manufacturer's advice to reduce airspeed if 
turbulence is encountered.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 Appendix 1: ZK -IHU maintenance and post -accident testing  
1. Recent maintenance  
1.1. The previous scheduled maintenance was a 100 -hour check completed on 21 February 2013 at 
699 flight hours.  At that check the main rotor swash plate lower scissor link ball -end was 
replaced because of wear.  Earlier airframe maintenance of note included the following:  
Date  Flight hours  Action  
9 July 2012  354 main rotor blade spindle boots58 replaced due oil leak.  
6 October 2012  406 (1) spindle boots replaced again, because of contact 
with main rotor hub  
(2) main rotor pitch links upper rod ends and lower 
links replaced because of wear.  
18 January 
2013  601 spindle boot (blade serial number 0217) replaced 
again due wear from contact with the main rotor hub.  
 
1.2. Robinson advised that the cause of spindle boots rubbing  on the hub was likely to be improper 
spindle boot  installation or a flight event that included excessive coning and/or teetering .  The 
company that usual ly maint ained the helicopter said the replacement frequency was high, but not 
unheard of  in the smalle r R44, which uses similar parts.  
1.3. Robinson R66 Service Letter 06, issued on 21 December 2012, recommended a check of the tail 
rotor drive shaft damper assembly for incorrect installation during manufacture.  The check was 
to be done when the drive shaft was  next removed, but no opportunity for that had arisen before 
the accident.  Later inspection showed that the damper had been installed incorrectly.  Robinson 
advised that incorrect installation did not affect damper performance.  
1.4. In September 2012 the engin e oil filter went into bypass mode after being blocked by carbon 
particles.  Rolls -Royce advised that the degree of contamination was normal for the type of oil 
being used.  The oil and filter element were replaced, the magnetic chip plugs were checked and  
a satisfactory ground run was carried out.  Another oil filter bypass occurred in October 2012, but 
no contamination was found.  As the oil filter case was suspected of being defective, it was 
replaced.  No further problems were reported with the oil syst em. 
1.5. Robinson R -66 Service Bulletin 05B, issued on 21 December 2012, required  the replacement of 
the engine -to-gearbox sprag clutch retaining bolt, which eliminated play between the engine 
power take -off shaft and the clutch splines.59  The bulletin required the task to be completed 
within the next 100 flight hours after receipt of the bulletin or by 31 March 2013 , whichever 
occurred first.  The helicopter accrued approximately 180 hours, and had two 100 -hour 
inspections, between 22 Decem ber 2012 and the time of the accident, without the bolt having 
been replaced.  The primary maintenance provider attributed the hours ' overrun to changing 
parts requirements and availability caused by two revisions in 18 days to the original bulletin.  
1.6. When  the clutch was removed from the helicopter after the accident, it did not turn freely in the 
freewheel direction.  The clutch was examined at the Robinson factory on 10 May 2013, under 
the supervision of the NTSB.  The report on the examination commented that the damage to the 
clutch was typical of impact damage.60 
1.7. The next annual review of airworthiness was due on 4 December 2013.  
  
                                                        
58 The spindle is the pitch change bearing of t he main rotor blade .  The boots are flexible covers that retain the 
bearing lubricant.  
59 A sprag clutch transfers the engine torque to the main rotor transmission.  In the event of an engine failure, the 
sprags withdraw, allowing the rotor to continue to t urn so that the helicopter can autorotate to a landing.    
60 The Commission consider ed that  the sprag clutch maintenance was not a factor in the accident .

 2. Post-accident testing  
Engine monitoring unit  
2.1. The engine monitoring unit recorded the following parameters once every second:  
 gas producer (compressor) speed ('N1')  
 power turbine speed ('N2')  
 torque (the primary indicator of the power being demanded from the engine)  
 measured gas temperature (MGT).  
2.2. During the 10 seconds prior to the end of the recorded data, when the data became a nomalous, 
the average values of the parameters were:  
Torque (%)61 N1 (%)  N2 (%)  MGT (OF) 
75 93 100 1130  
 
2.3. According to the flight manual, t he maximum allowable MGT for 75% torque (at a pressure 
altitude of 4 ,000 feet and an assumed temperature of 15OC) was  approximately 645OC 
(1,193OF).  Therefore the engine parameters were within the flight manual limits until 
immediately prior to the accident.  
Engine and engine accessories  
2.4. Under the supervision of an NTSB investigator, Rolls -Royce disassembled and examined the 
engine at its manufacturing plant in the United States.  The Rolls -Royce report noted that 
"nothing was discovered which would prohibit normal engine operation " and th at all observations 
were "consistent with engine operation at impact ". 
2.5. The power turbine governor62 and fuel control unit63 were disassembled and inspected by their 
manufacturer, Honeywell, at its plant in the United States.  These inspections were performed  
under the supervision of an FAA inspector, acting for the NTSB.  For both items, the Honeywell 
report stated, in part:  
discounting impact damage, no condition could be found that would prevent 
normal operation.  
Main rotor control hydraulic servos  
2.6. Pilot co ntrol of the main rotor pitch was assisted by three hydraulic servos.  The servos were 
examined under the supervision of the NTSB on 10 May 2013 at the Robinson factory, where 
they had been manufactured.  The servo that had been installed in the forward le ft position (one 
of the two cyclic servos) operated smoothly but, because of impact damage, it could not be tested 
against production specifications.  For each of the other two servos, Robinson's examination 
report stated:  
A functional test was performed a nd the servo operated within production 
specifications.  
Main rotor drive shaft  
2.7. The Defence Technology Agency of the New Zealand Defence Force conducted a metallurgical 
and fractographic64 examination of the main rotor drive shaft to determine the failure mode.  The 
Agency's report65 commented:  
                                                        
61 The torque was recorded by the monitoring unit in units of pressure, but was displayed to pilots as  a percentage.  
The recorded data was converted using a formula provided by Robinson.  
62 Model AL -AA2 Part number 2549170 -2, serial number HR49120.  
63 Model DP -N2, part number 2549196 -1, serial number HR60017.  
64 Fractography is the examination of the cause o f a material failure by studying the characteristics of the fracture 
surface.  
65 Technical Memorandum C1281, Main rotor drive shaft failure of R66 ZK -IHU, 19 June 2013.  

<< Page 34 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -003 Failure occurred by overload and the nature of the fracture indicates that 
significant bending and torsional loads were applied … The direction of to rsional 
loading was consistent with power being applied to the rotor while the rotor was 
abruptly decelerated, perhaps through contact with the airframe or some other 
object . 
2.8. The Agency's report included the following conclusions:  
 fracture of the main roto r drive shaft was due to excessive loading with no 
evidence of pre -existing cracking or defect  
 fracture of the mast exhibits evidence that severe mast bending combined 
with torsional loading from the power train caused the overload failure  
 mast wall thickn esses were found to be essentially consistent with those 
specified for the R66 mast.  Analysis indicated that the shaft material was 
consistent with the specified material (4340 steel).

 Appendix 2: Further accident site information  
1. The location of the accident is shown in Figure 4 and the distribution of the major wreckage in 
Figure  5. 
2. Both landing skids were attached to the fuselage, but the snowshoe -type heels were separated 
and the toe of the left skid had also fractured.  
3. The tail  rotor drive shaft had separated at the forward flexible coupling, and the tail boom had 
separated aft of the oil cooler.  The tail rotor blades had minor impact damage only, indicative of 
little or no rotation when the tail boom fell into the trees.  The tail rotor guard and the lower 
vertical stabili ser were damaged, but most likely during the recovery of the tail boom.  
4. The main transmission could be turned without obvious noise or restriction.  The engine -to-
transmission drive shaft had fractured at the forward flexible coupling.  The surrounding braided 
oil lines were wrapped around the drive shaft along its length.  Damage to the engine casings was 
caused by external impacts.  Damage to the pneumatic lines precluded a thorough checking of 
that system.  
5. Fuel flow was demonstrated from the fuel tank to the fuel pump, and from the pump to the fuel 
nozzle on the engine combustor.  The nozzle was found to be satisfactory during the later tear -
down examination of the engine.  Both magnetic plugs were visibly cl ean. 
6. The push -pull rods under the cockpit floor for the collective, lateral cyclic and tail rotor controls 
were severed as a result of the main rotor blade strike.66  The fore -aft cyclic control was bent.  
Control continuity was established from rearward of  the underfloor disruption to the hydraulic 
servos.  No conclusions could be drawn as to the pre -impact positions of the flight controls.  
7. Owing  to the extensive damage to the cockpit instrument pedestal, no significant information was 
obtained from the ins truments.  The wreckage was examined for any evidence of a bird strike, but 
none was found.  
8. The fuel tank was made of a puncture -resistant, flexible material that was not damaged, even 
though adjacent structure and panels were torn and disrupted.  
                                                        
66 The collective lever and the cyclic stick are two of a pilot's controls for the main r otor.  The collective lever is 
used to change the main rotor blade pitch angles collectively, which causes the helicopter to climb or descend.  
Cyclic stick movement causes the rotor blade pitch angles to change at the same point during their rotation cycl e, 
which causes the rotor to tilt in the direction that the pilot has put the stick.  The helicopter then moves in that 
direction.

 Final report AO -2013 -003 Appendix 3: The NTSB special investigation of Robinson accidents  
1. In 1994, concerned  by the number of unexplained R22 accidents  that involved a mast bump or 
low main rotor RPM ('loss of main rotor control') , the NTSB commenced a special investigation to 
examine those accidents and the certification history and handling qualities of the R2 2.  The 
investigation was later expanded to include similar R44 accidents.  
2. In response to the initial recommendations made by the NTSB during the investigation, the FAA 
issued airworthiness directives (ADs) that limited R22 and R44 operations in high winds  and 
turbulence.  The final versions, AD 95 -26-04 for the R22 and AD 95 -26-05 for the R44, were 
issued in 1996.  AD 95 -26-04 was later made permanent, but AD 95 -26-05 was rescinded in 
2004 after a review of the R44 in -service experience.67 
3. AD 95 -26-04 inclu ded, in part, the following information:  
 Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions and aircraft characteristics 
that lead to main rotor blade / fuselage contact accidents, and corrective type design 
changes and operating limitations are iden tified, Model R22 pilots are strongly urged 
to become familiar with the following information and comply with these 
recommended procedures.  
 Main Rotor Stall : …  Any flight condition that creates excessive angle of attack on the 
main rotor blades can produce a stall.  Low main rotor RPM, aggressive manoeuvring, 
high collective angle (… high density altitude, over -pitching … during climb, or high 
forward airspeed) … The effect of these conditions can be amplified in turbulence.  
 Mast Bumping : Mast bumpin g may occur with a teetering rotor system when 
excessive main rotor flapping results from low 'G' … or abrupt control input … High 
forward airspeed, turbulence and excessive sideslip can accentuate the adverse 
effects of these control movements.  
 To avoid t hese conditions, pilots are strongly urged to follow these recommendations:  
 Maintain cruise airspeeds between 60 [k nots] and less than 0.9 [of maximum 
permitted airspeed] …  
 Avoid large, rapid forward cyclic inputs in forward flight, and abrupt control inputs in 
turbulence.  
4. The FAA also issued SFAR 73 in 1995 to mandate specified awareness and flight training for all 
pilots of R22 and R44 helicopters.  SFAR 73 required that the special training be delivered by an 
authorised instructor and completed by ev ery pilot before "manipulating the controls " of a 
Robinson helicopter.  The SFAR 73 also stipulated that an annual flight review be undertaken in 
the applicable helicopter type until a specified minimum experience was attained, after which 
biannual flight reviews, in the relevant type, were required.68  SFAR 73 was made permanent in 
June 2009.  
5. The NTSB special investigation report noted that the FAA had conducted three  special 
certification reviews of the R22 between 1982 and 1994.  Each review had concluded  that the 
R22 was safe "when flown within its operating limitations ".  However, the NTSB found no 
evidence that the FAA had acted on internal recommendations regarding the certification testing 
of light helicopters and their dynamic stability during manoeu vres (NTSB, 1996, pp. 20,21) . 
6. Robinson conducted flight tests of the R22 in 1982 to survey rotor teeter clearances and the 
response to flight control inputs, and concluded that the R22 main rotor system "would not stall , 
exceed its teeter clearance, or contact the tail boom when the aircraft is flown within its approved 
limitations " (NTSB, 1996, p. 23) .  Similar tests conducted with the R44 in 1995 concluded that 
"the R44 could safely pe rform any nominal flight activity without main rotor divergence 
tendencies"  (NTSB, 1996, p. 23) .  However, because "the tests were not (and could not safely be) 
conducted to determine the [R44's] response to large, abrupt cyclic inputs … the flight test did 
                                                        
67 Robinson took other action to improve the R22, including installation of an electronic fuel control governor (which 
helps t o control main rotor speed), a more powerful engine, and an automatic carburettor heat control.  
68 On 11 June 2015, Robinson published a tutorial on SFAR 73 at www.gyronimosystems.com/SFAR . 
  
Final rep ort AO -2013003 
<< Page 39 >>
 not provide the data needed to determine the mechanism for the blade diverging into the body"  
(NTSB, 1996, p. 23) . 
7. The obvious constraints on hazardous flight testing led to a mathematic al simulation model of 
R22 main rotor dynamics being developed by the Georgia Institute of Tech nology  School of 
Aerospace Engineering  (Schrage, 1995) .69  The project ended due to a lack of funds before the 
model was fully validate d or had research ed all of the area s of interest (for example, divergent 
modes of the rotor that led to blade -fuselage strikes)  (NTSB, 1996, p. 24) .  However, for those 
areas of the flight envelope that were  validated, the model verified the theory that push -overs 
(which cause a low-G condition) could  lead to a main rotor blade striking the fuselage.  
8. The Georgia Institute of Tech nology  report stated that "within the scope of this investigation no 
[static droo p] stop contact or rotor/tail boom strikes occurred in the normal operating range of 
the helicopter", but some of the scenarios did produce notional mast bumps and hub contact 
with the droop stop  (Schrage, 1995, p. 127) . 
9. The report concluded, in part  (Schrage, 1995, p. 133) : 
The results from the cases executed in this report fall into three basic categories: (i) 
cases where no excessive flapping was observed, (ii) cases where larger than normal 
flapping behavior was observed, and the various limits of the blade and hub were 
exceeded, and (iii) cases where there was indication of a definite tail boom strike.  
The primary objective of many of the cases executed in this investigation was to f ind 
as many flight conditions as possible which fall in the last category.  As one would 
expect these cases correspond to maneuvers with large pilot inputs, cases where 
rotor stall is a factor, severe gusts among others.  Thus, some cases have been 
identif ied, where the simulation model seems to indicate a potential failure mode.  
These are primarily related to rotor stall at lower rpm …  In case of pushover 
scenarios, simulation results indicate a sensitivity to abrupt aft cyclic under 
conditions of deep r otor stall.  Gust under moderate conditions, seems not to be a 
problem even at high gross weights.  
10. The Georgia Institute of Tech nology  report recommended further areas of study, but the FAA 
confirmed in 2013 that the intended research had not been complete d. 
11. Studies by the NTSB and manufacturers have shown that a low -inertia main rotor blade can strike 
the fuselage in just a few revolutions.  That would take  less than half a second for an R66 main 
rotor operating at the normal speed of 408 RPM.  
12. The NTSB's s pecial investigation "found no direct evidence of an unstable blade or rotor system 
design.  The extensive operational history, the wreckage evidence, flight tests, and computer 
simulations indicate that a dynamically unstable main rotor system is unlikely " (NTSB, 1996, p. 
25).  The NTSB recognised that many factors, including large, abrupt pilot control inputs, were 
possible explanations for the accidents.  
13. The summary of the NTSB special investigation report stated, in part (NTSB, 1996, p. 27) : 
The Board is also concerned that in the future, other highly responsive helicopters 
are likely to be designed and built that may hav e characteristics similar to the R22.  
Consequently, the Safety Board believes that as a part of the certification process for 
highly responsive helicopters, the FAA should establish operational requirements, 
student pilot training requirements, and instru ctor pilot requirements, such as those 
imposed on the R22 and R44, to ensure that pilots at all levels of qualification and 
skills can adequately operate the helicopter.  The Safety Board concludes that 
although the response rate of the R22 to cyclic input  is not unsafe so long as the 
special operating rules remain in place, there is a need for the FAA to consider the 
responsiveness of helicopters (especially lightweight, high performance helicopters 
such as the R22) as part of the certification process to determine if special operating 
rules or guidance are necessary.  Thus, the Safety Board believes that the FAA 
should require helicopter manufacturers to provide data on the response of 
helicopters to large, abrupt cyclic inputs as a part of the certificati on process and

 Final report AO -2013 -003 require operational limitations or other measures for those helicopters that are more 
responsive, such as the R22.  
14. The NTSB made the following recommendations to the FAA at the conclusion of its special 
investigation  (NTSB, 1996, p. 31) : 
Ensure that Special Federal Aviation Regulation 73, the Flight Standardization Board 
specifications, and the airworthiness directives applicable to the operation of the 
R22 and R44 are made permanent (A -96-9) 
Establish, for f uture certification of highly responsive helicopters, operational 
requirements, student pilot training requirements, and instructor pilot requirements, 
such as those imposed for the R22 and R44, necessary to ensure that pilots of all 
levels of qualificatio n and skills can adequately operate the helicopter (A -96-10) 
Require helicopter manufacturers to provide data on the response of helicopters to 
flight control inputs to be used as part of the certification process, and require 
operational limitations or ot her measures for those helicopters that are highly 
responsive (A -96-11) 
In conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, continue  the 
development of the simulator model of lightweight helicopters, using flight tests and 
whirl tower te sts as needed to validate the model, to create a national resource tool 
for the study of flight control systems and main rotor blade dynamics.  If any unusual 
main rotor blade system characteristics are found, ensure that the information and 
data gathered are disseminated to the appropriate agencies and industry (A -96-12). 
15. The status of recommendation A -96-9 was changed to 'Closed -acceptable action' in December 
1996 after the FAA agreed to make the listed documents permanent.  
16. The status of recommendation A-96-10 was also changed to 'Closed -acceptable action' in 
December 1996 after the FAA committed to establish ing a Flight Standardization Board for each 
newly certificated helicopter to determine the operational and pilot training requirements . 
17. In response to recommendation A -96-11, the FAA twice amended A dvisory Circular 27-1, 
Certification of Normal Category Rotorc raft.  The changes added guidance to manufacturers on a 
means of compliance with regulation 14CFR27.661, which requires rotor -fuselage clearance  "for 
any operating condition ".  In a letter to the NTSB seeking closure of the recommendation, the FAA 
stated that the guidance material addressed large control inputs by pilots and low-G manoeuvres.  
As a result, on 17 March 2000 the NTSB changed the rec ommendation status to 'Closed -
acceptable action'.  
18. Recommendation A -96-12 was closed by the NTSB in  1998 after  it received a submission from 
the FAA, which read in part:70 
The FAA has reviewed the merits of developing a simulation tool for aiding the 
certifi cation of future helicopter flight control systems/blade dynamics and has 
determined that such a tool would have limited application.  This determination 
considered the actions that have already been accomplished and the status of the 
NASA initiative.  The  behavior of certain rotor system configurations may become 
unpredictable and dangerous beyond certain boundaries.  For this reason, the FAA 
established a certified operating envelope.  Due to the combination of extremely 
complex  flight control inputs, non -linear environmental gust effects and the inherent 
difficulties in various rotor blade airfoil/hub designs, development of a single generic 
mathematical model to predict acceptable flight limitations would have limited 
application.  Subsequent validation of the math model would involve extensive 
testing with significant risk to flight safety.  
19. The NTSB accepted t hat "the bulk of the effort towards continued math modelling of lightweight 
rotor systems will be conducted by [ the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and the 
FAA has reached the limits of its technical involvement ".
