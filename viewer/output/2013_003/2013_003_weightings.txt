There is no mention of the pilot being tired or overworked, and fatigue management issues are not discussed. Therefore, Fatigue Management is not considered a factor in this accident.
","0.0","5.0","The possibility that an intentional or inadvertent control input by the pilot contributed to the mast bump cannot be excluded (5.3). If the pilot had reacted to the turbulence with an inappropriate flight control input, such as an abrupt input or by applying left cyclic in response to a right roll when experiencing low G, that could have caused the mast bump and the main rotor blade contact with the fuselage (4.2.12). Human error and assumptions about how to react to the helicopter's behavior in turbulence are therefore contributing factors.
","0.0","15.0","The report indicates that the R66 was certificated without any special pilot training requirements or operating restrictions, unlike the smaller R22 which had minimum pilot experience and maximum wind strength requirements (4.3.1). Additionally, pilots qualified to fly the R22 or R44 might infer from the lack of special training for the R66 that it does not require the same careful handling, which is not the case (4.4.20). The accident history suggests that the R66 is as vulnerable as the R22 and R44 to catastrophic mast bump under certain conditions (4.4.18, 4.4.19, 5.4). Therefore, training and competency are significant factors in this accident, as the lack of mandated special training for the R66 may have contributed to the pilot's inability to handle the helicopter safely in turbulent conditions.
","0.0","1.667","The report does not indicate that a lack of familiarity with the R66 helicopter equipment contributed to the accident. The pilot had been supervised over most of the operator's routes and into most landing sites, including the Mangataramea Hut, and had received type rating training and an initial competency check (4.7.3). Therefore, Training and Familiarity with Equipment is not considered a factor in this accident.
","2.887","0.0","There is no mention in the report of issues related to teamwork, communication, or leadership skills among crew members, as the pilot was effectively making his own operational decisions and flying alone (4.7.1). Therefore, Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in this accident.
","0.0","20.0","The report highlights that the Robinson helicopter flight manuals did not adequately warn pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that can lead rapidly to a catastrophic mast bump (5.6). The revised Safety Notice SN-32 shifted the emphasis from advising pilots to avoid hazardous weather conditions to suggesting that ""improper"" handling was the cause of mast bump accidents in high winds and turbulence (4.2.9). The pilot's adherence to the recommended procedures for flying in turbulence, which includes reducing airspeed, was not followed, as indicated by the airspeed of approximately 115 knots before the accident (4.2.11). This lack of adherence to safety procedures is a significant factor in the accident.
","0.0","10.0","The operator's records did not show that the pilot had completed or been excused from mountain flying training relevant to his role, although it is highly likely that he had received such training (4.7.3). The lack of reference in the operator's exposition to mountain flying training suggests that the organizational safety culture may not have fully supported the importance of specialized training for operating in mountainous terrain (4.7.7). While the pilot's training was unlikely to have been a factor in the accident, the organizational safety culture regarding training and safety procedures is still a relevant factor.
","0.0","11.667","The report indicates that there is insufficient industry knowledge of why Robinson helicopters are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic mast bump events (5.7). The lack of completed research into the dynamic behavior of the main rotor system under conditions of low G and turbulence means that not all causal factors of mast bump accidents have been identified (4.6.9). This gap in risk management and analysis is a factor in the accident, as it suggests that the industry has not fully addressed the risks associated with flying Robinson helicopters in turbulent conditions.
","2.887","10.0","The report discusses the certification process for the R66 and notes that the R66 was certificated without any special pilot training requirements to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic mast bump (5.5). The Flight Standardization Board for the R66 did not require special training for R66 pilots, despite the similarities in response to low G between the R66 and the smaller R22 and R44 (4.4.18). The lack of regulatory requirements for special training for the R66 is a factor in the accident, as it may have contributed to a gap in the pilot's preparedness to handle the helicopter safely in turbulent conditions.
","0.0","3.333","The pilot's situational awareness regarding the environmental conditions and the helicopter's behavior in response to those conditions is a factor. The report suggests that the pilot may not have been fully aware of the severity of the turbulence or the helicopter's vulnerability to mast bump under such conditions (4.2.12, 4.2.8). A loss of situational awareness regarding the need to reduce speed in turbulent conditions contributed to the accident.
","2.887","0.0","The accident was an in-flight break-up caused by a mast bump, and there is no indication in the report that emergency response preparedness was a factor. The focus of the investigation was on the causes leading up to the mast bump, not on the response after the event. Therefore, Emergency Response Preparedness is not considered a factor in this accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report indicates that some minor maintenance inconsistencies were identified, but no pre-existing technical defect that could have preceded the mast bump event was found (4.2.2). Since maintenance and inspection regimes did not contribute to the accident, this theme is not considered a factor.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not discuss any issues related to the use of automation or automated systems in the operation of the R66 helicopter. Therefore, Use of Automation is not considered a factor in this accident.
","0.0","23.333","The accident occurred under conditions of moderate or greater turbulence, which likely resulted in a condition of low G, exacerbated by the helicopter's light weight and estimated airspeed of 115 knots (5.2). The report also notes that the pilot's airspeed was well above the recommended speed for 'significant' turbulent conditions (4.2.11). The environmental and aircraft conditions at the time of the accident, including altitude, ground speed, air temperature, and wind, were assumed to be contributing factors (4.2.3). The pilot's decision to fly in these conditions, despite the known risks of turbulence, indicates that weather conditions and decision making were significant factors in the accident.
","2.887","0.0","The report does not indicate that there was a failure in communication between the pilot and any other parties. The pilot was flying alone, and there is no mention of miscommunication being a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, Communication Breakdown is not considered a factor in this accident.
","0.0","0.0","There are no additional safety themes identified in the report that contributed to the accident outside of those predefined. Therefore, no ""Other"" safety theme is necessary.","0.0","true","N/A"
