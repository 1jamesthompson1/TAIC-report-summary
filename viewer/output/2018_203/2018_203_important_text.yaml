  \  \n4.1.1.  Historically, planning a ship's voyage primarily focused on the pilot\
  \ -to-pilot leg of the voyage - \nbetween  when  a pilot disembarked at the departure\
  \ port to when a pilot embarked at the \narrival port.  \n4.1.2.  In recent years\
  \ there has been industry acknowledgment that the portion of the voyage that \n\
  carries the biggest risk is when the ship is navigating confined waters , characterised\
  \  by \nnavigation hazards , shallow water, restricted sea room and high traffic\
  \ density.   The \nrequirement to carry a maritime pilot is a safety measure to\
  \ reduce  the risk of navigational \naccidents in designated pilotage areas.   \n\
  4.1.3.  Voyage or passage planning and its princip al elements  - appraisal, planning,\
  \ execution and \nmonitoring  - are fundamental in ensur ing the safety of a vessel\
  \ whilst on passage.  Voyage \nplanning is now required to be conducted from berth\
  \ to berth, which encompasses the \npilotage  operation.  \n4.1.4.  In New Zealand\
  \ it is compulsory for large ships  to carry marine pilot s in designated pilotage\
  \ \nareas.22  A significant challenge for  the industry is to change a culture whereby\
  \ ships ' crews \noften relax when a pilot embarks and put too much faith in the\
  \ pilot getting it right.  The goal is \nto achieve consistency in standards and\
  \ operating procedures for the ship operator and the \npilotage provider , in order\
  \ for the people  to merge and work as one team when a pilot is on \nboard.  \n\
  4.1.5.  The Commission has published four accident reports23 in the past five years\
  \ involving  ships \nthat have run aground, all due in part to poor standards of\
  \ bridge resource management and \nthe pilots and br idge crew not sharing the same\
  \ concept s of the passage plan s.  This \ngrounding has similarities . \n4.1.6.\
  \  The following analysis considers  how and why the Leda Maersk  ran aground whilst\
  \ under the \nconduct of an experienced, qualified pilot working with an experienced\
  \ , qualified  bridge team .  \nIt also discusses the following safety issues: \
  \ \n\uF0B7 Port Otago's safety management system fell short of achieving good  industry\
  \  standards \nfor pilotage operation s \n\uF0B7 The bridge operations  on board\
  \ the Leda Maersk  fell short of achieving good industry \npractice for both planning\
  \ and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge \nresource management . \n\
  4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The ship was entering Port Otago in darkness , proceeding\
  \ at slow speed into the last of the \nebb tide . \n4.2.2.  The pilot was standing\
  \ at the front of the bridge , just to port of  the ship's  centreline .  Having\
  \ \ndiscounted the positional information provided by the  PPU, the pilot was  navigating\
  \ primarily \nby visual means, using the channel beacon lights and sets of lead\
  \ ing lights along the shore  to \njudge the ship's position in the channel .  The\
  \ pilot was , however , still referring to the PPU from \ntime to time to monitor\
  \ the ship's rate of turn.  \n4.2.3.  The Leda Maersk  pass ed Acheron Point where\
  \ the channel began curving  left (see Figure 4).  \nAt this point  the navigable\
  \ channel was app roximat ely 185  metres  across .  The Leda Maersk 's \nbeam of\
  \  37.5  metres  left only about 73.8 m etres  of safe water either side of the\
  \ ship  when it \nwas in the centre of the channel . \n                        \
  \                                \n22 Maritime Rules Part 90.  \n23 MO 2016 -202\

  \ \nL'Austral . \n \nFinal Report MO -2018 -203 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2.4.  The Leda\
  \ Maersk  was proceeding at a speed of about six knots at Acheron Point , which\
  \ was in \naccordance with the recommended speed profile contained in the  Otago\
  \  Lower Harbour \nPilotage Guide.  The pilot's previous experience with 'L-class'\
  \ vessels was that it would be \ndifficult to turn the ship unless the ship was\
  \  carrying sufficient speed . \n4.2.5.  The Leda Maersk  was in the centre of the\
  \ channel and on track when the left turn \ncommenced.  It was the pilot's intention\
  \ to keep the ship in the centre of the channel through \nthe turn .  The pilot's\
  \ expectation was that a large amount of port helm would be required to \nmake the\
  \ turn .  However, the ship started to move left of the intended track .  There\
  \ are a \nnumber of factors  that could have contributed to  this: \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ influence of the port rudder being applied  \n\uF0B7 any residual ebb tide  pushing\
  \ the ship from right to left  \n\uF0B7 interaction between the ship's hull and\
  \ the seabed and/or channel banks (sides)  \n\uF0B7 a combination of some or all\
  \ of these factors . \n4.2.6.  The ECDIS display (Figure 5), the radar display (Figure\
  \ 6) and the pilot's PPU (Figure 7) clearly \nshow ed this drift towards the left\
  \ bank of the channel . \n \nFigure 5 \nThe Leda Maersk 's position at 1824 from\
  \ the ECDIS replay  \n \n \n \n\n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -203  \n\

  \ past positions  \n \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2018 -203 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.2.7.\
  \  As the left turn continued , a large amount of port helm was being applied (Figure\
  \ 4) .  The \nheading of the ship changed marginally to port  and the ship continued\
  \ moving further left of \nthe planned  track.  When it had deviated approximately\
  \ 55  metres  left of the planned track , \nthe ECDIS off -track alert activated\
  \ .  The aler t was informing the bridge team that the ship had \nreached the pre\
  \ -set cross -track limit.24  However, this important information was not brought\
  \ \nto the attention of the master or the pilot.  \n4.2.8.  As the heading of  the\
  \ ship altered to port , the ship move d further l eft of  the planned track  and\
  \ \nwent  very close to the left bank  of the channel .  Once the ship came close\
  \ to the left bank , at \nabout beacon  20A, it is about as likely as not that a\
  \ suction effect was created around the \nunderwater mid -section and towards the\
  \ stern.  This is an example of a phenomenon  known \nas interaction.  It is the\
  \ result of  a ship displacing water  as it moves forward in a narrow \nchannel\
  \ .  The water increas es in velocity  as it is forced t hrough the narrow gap between\
  \ the \nhull and the left bank .  The increase in water velocity causes a suction\
  \ effect, drawing the hull \ninto the side of the bank.  The pilot was expecting\
  \ to need  high rudder angles to make the \nturn.  However, it is likely that the\
  \ pilot would also have been unknowingly having to overcome \nany forces drawing\
  \ the ship's stern into the left bank . \n4.2.9.  When the ship initially started\
  \ to swing to port, the bridge was still travelling out near the \ncentre channel.\
  \  However,  the bow, 190  metres forward of the bridge , was already angled \n\
  towards and closing  with the left channel bank.   The pilot was standing on the\
  \ bridge  focused \nmainly on the beacons either side of the channel and a set of\
  \ leadin g lights ahead  of the ship  \nin the vicinity of  the swinging basin .25\
  \ \n4.2.10.  Additionally, containers had been stacked six tiers high near the extremities\
  \ of the ship.  On \nthe L-class container ship s this was kno wn to cause bridge\
  \ team s to lose sight of channel \nbeacons passing close by the ship s.  As the\
  \ ship drew closer to the left bank, from where the \npilot was standing the pilot\
  \ would have lost sight of the left bank channel markers below the \ncontainer stack\
  \ s.  Figure 8 shows an example of how containers stacked in this manner can \n\
  affect visibility.  \n                                                        \n\

  \  \n4.2.11.  In the dark and navigating only by visual means, the bridge team and\
  \ the pilot appear ed to \nhave lost awareness of the factors affecting the progress\
  \ of the ship , until the ship heeled to \nstarboard and stopped in spite of its\
  \ propeller still turning ahead.  \n4.2.12.  The grounding is an example of why\
  \ it is not appropriate to use visual navigation alone (often \nreferred to as line\
  \ -of-sight navigation) when manoeuvring large sh ips in narrow channels, and \n\
  in the dark.  With so little margin for error, it would have been appropriate to\
  \ utili se fully the \naccuracy of electronic navigation aids such as PPUs and ECDIS.\
  \  Had the pilot done so, the \nship's depart ure from the intended tra ck would\
  \ have  been  readily apparent in time to avoid \nthe grounding.  \n4.2.13.  Equally,\
  \ had the ship's crew been monitoring the ship 's passage, they could have alerted\
  \ the \npilot immediately to the ship departing from the agreed passage plan.  These\
  \ aspects are  \ncovere d in the following section s. \n4.3. Bridge resource management\
  \ and human factors  \n4.3.1.  The International Chamber of Shipping Bridge Procedures\
  \ Guide de scribes an effective bridge \nteam as one that \"will manage efficiently\
  \ all the resources that are available and promote  \ngood communication and teamwork\"\
  .  An effective bridge team will be able to plan and \ncomplete a passage from berth\
  \ to berth and anticipate and respond to any dangerous \nsituations and emergencies\
  \ that may arise during the passage.  \n4.3.2.  By sharing information th rough\
  \ good communication, members of the bridge team can \nsupport situational awareness\
  \ and ensure that everybody knows what is happening .  \nDeveloping a good bridge\
  \ resource management  system will not only spread the workload on \nBay 40  \n\
  beacon  \nbreakwater  \n \nFinal Report MO -2018 -203 \n<< Page 17 >>\n the bridge,\
  \ but promote an environment that accepts that errors will happen.  Maritime \n\
  professionals who have bridge resource management  training are taught  to identify\
  \ such \nerrors and act appropriately before they can develop into accident s. \
  \  \n4.3.3.  The pilot h ad been incorporated into the bridge team through the usual\
  \ exchanges of \ninformation that occur when a pilot boards .  The master, the chief\
  \ officer and the pilot had all \nbeen trained in bridge resource management  techniques.\
  \  During t he pilot/master exchan ge, \nthe pilot encourag ed the bridge team to\
  \ challenge \"always\" if the y had  any issues  with the \npilotage .  The master\
  \ and the chief officer  later said they  were confident that they would have \n\
  spoken up had they been aware of the developing problem, but ever ything  had \"\
  looked fine\".   \nThe fundamental reason for everything  \"looking fine\" to every\
  \ member of the bridge team as \nthe ship deviated from the plan ned track and ran\
  \ aground is discussed in more detail below.  \n4.4. Passage plan  \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ passage plan on the ship 's ECDIS was broadly the same as that which  the pilot\
  \ had \nloaded on the PPU, but not identical.   In this case the passage plan was\
  \ uncomplicated , \nkeeping the ship in the centre of the channel.  Therefore, the\
  \ differences between the two \nplans were  not a factor in the grounding.  \n4.4.2.\
  \  Nevertheless, i t is important for all ac ts of pilotage that there is a single\
  \ agreed passage plan.  \nIf there is no agreed plan there is a danger that the\
  \ pilot and the ship's crew will have differing \nmental concept s of how the pilotage\
  \ wi ll be performed.  If there is no  agreed passage plan, the \npilot and ship's\
  \ crew have no basis for monitoring the ship 's progress and raising interventions\
  \ \nif the ship deviates from the intended track.  The Commission has published\
  \ several reports \nwhere not  working to agreed plan s contributed to ship s running\
  \ aground.   There are several \nexamples published by other investigation agencies\
  \ as well.  This issue  is the subject of \nseveral open recommendations , and influenced\
  \  the Commission to place  accidents under  \npilotage on its watch list.  \n4.5.\
  \ Human behaviour  \n4.5.1.  In order to understand wh at went wrong on the bridge\
  \ of  the Leda Maersk  that night, it is \nworth considering a series of marine\
  \ guidance notes published  by the United Kingdom \nMaritime and Coastguard Agency\
  \  aimed at providing guidance to the maritime industry on \nhuman behaviour.  Marine\
  \ Guidance Note  520 (M) - Human Element Guidance:  The Deadly \nDozen - 12 Significant\
  \ People Factors in Maritime Safety aimed to raise  awareness of 12 of \nthe mos\
  \ t prevalent human factors that contribute to maritime accidents.  Identified through\
  \ \nthe Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme , these factors\
  \ and \ncorresponding mitigating actions are summarised in the marine guidance note,\
  \  which has \nbeen reproduced  on ma ny maritime industry websites.   Figure 9\
  \ shows a poster that \nencapsulates the se 12 factors.\n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final\
  \ Report MO -2018 -203  \nFigure 9 \nThe Deadly Dozen ( Mari ne Guidance Note  520\
  \ (M)) \n (Used with the permission of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency , United\
  \ Kingdom)\n\n \nFinal Report MO -2018 -203 \n<< Page 19 >>\n  \n4.5.2.  Of these\
  \ 12 factors, at least five stand out as factors contributing to the grounding \
  \ of the Leda \nMaersk .  In order of development, they are :  \n\uF0B7 teamwork\
  \ (How well do you really work together?)  \n\uF0B7 complacency (Is everything really\
  \ OK?)  \n\uF0B7 situational awareness (Do you really know what's happening?)  \n\
  \uF0B7 alerting (Do you really speak up when you should?)  \n\uF0B7 culture (Do\
  \ you really have a good safety culture?) . \n4.6. Teamwork  \n4.6.1.  Although\
  \ the pilot and the ship's crew went through the mo tions of establishing the bridge\
  \ \nteam, there are some indications that they were not truly working as one team.\
  \   \n4.6.2.  It is about as likely as not that the pilot's use of a PPU led the\
  \ ship's bridge team to believe \nthat the pilot did not need their support beca\
  \ use he had his own electronic navigation aid.  \nEvidence in support of this is\
  \ that none of the ship's bridge team was closely monitoring the \nradar and ship\
  \ ECDIS.  Had they been, they would not have been so surprised that the ship \n\
  had run aground .  When a  PPU is a pilot's own equipment , the ship's personnel\
  \ have no way of \nverifying that the PPU is functioning properly unless the pilot\
  \ tells them.  In this case the pilot \ndid not tell the bridge team that there\
  \ was some uncertainty about  the accuracy of the PPU, \nwhich is not consistent\
  \ with the team approach.  \n4.6.3.  Perhaps the most telling point was  that on\
  \ the reali sation that the ship had run aground, a \nmember of the bridge team\
  \ commented to the pilot , \"You appear to have run us aground\" . \n4.7. Complacency\
  \  \n4.7.1.  Complacency is described as \"a misplaced feeling that everything is\
  \ OK\" and can arise from \nrepeatedly carrying out the same task without prior\
  \ incident.  \n4.7.2.  The Leda Maersk  was a frequent caller to the Port of Otago\
  \ and its bridge crew were familiar \nwith the approaches to  the port.  The fact\
  \ that none of the bridge team was actively monitoring \nthe progress of the ship\
  \ on the electronic navigation equipment is indicative of their having  \nrelax\
  \ ed when the pilot embarked  and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right\
  \ .  This \nsituation effectively risked the pilot's performance becoming a single\
  \ point of failure , so when \nthe pilot experienced the not -abnormal human trait\
  \ of losing situation al awareness, this \nresulted in the ship running aground\
  \ . \n4.8. Situational awareness  \n4.8.1.  Situat ional awareness can be described\
  \ as an understanding of what is going on in one's \nsurroundings.  If members of\
  \ a ship's bridge team understand what the ship is doing and what \nis happening\
  \ around the ship at any one moment, they can predict the effect s of the control\
  \ \ninputs applied or assess what control inputs need to be changed.  \n4.8.2. \
  \ Situational awareness is a critical aspect of navigation and can be enhanced and\
  \ degraded by \nmany internal and external influences.  It can be enhanced by electronic\
  \ navigation aid s, \nmonitoring and alarm systems, communication and teamwork .\
  \  Convers ely, it can be degraded \nby a lack of communication and teamwork and\
  \ improper use of electronic systems.  \n4.8.3.  The ship  was a t a critical phase\
  \ of the agreed passage plan , yet none of the bridge team was \ntotally aware of\
  \ the factors influencing the track of the ship towards the left channel bank .\
  \ \n4.8.4.  The bridge team were all primarily navigating by eye and not verifying\
  \ that what they were \nseeing  correlated with the information in the ship's electronic\
  \ navigation system s.  All of the \nelectronic navigation aids showed that the\
  \ Leda Maersk  was off -track  and nearing the limit of \nsafe water to port.  \n\
  \n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -203 4.9. Alerting  \n4.9.1.  Had the bridge\
  \ team used all the available  features of ECDIS and radar to mo nitor the ship's\
  \ \nprogress , it is highly likely that they would have seen  that the ship was\
  \ deviating from its track .  \nLikewise , had the ECDIS off -track al ert been\
  \ communicated to the rest of the bridge team , it \nwould have  alerted them  to\
  \ the fact that the ship was moving away from i ts intended track \nand given them\
  \ an opportunity to take corrective action  before the vessel grounde d. \n4.10.\
  \  Safety culture  \n4.10.1.  Culture can be described as the way things are normally\
  \ done in a group or workplace.  For a \nship, it is largely driven by the effectiveness\
  \ of the ship safety management system and the \noverarching safety system owned\
  \ by the ship operator.  This accident a lone does  not mean \nthere was  a poor\
  \ safety culture.  However , there were  a number of indications that the ship's\
  \ \ncrew were not following the bridge and navigation aspects of the safety management\
  \ system, \nand that the safety management system for the port o perator had not\
  \ been fully developed.  \nThese aspects are discussed in the following sections.\
  \  \n4.11.  Organisational factors  \nThe ship operator  \nSafety issue - The bridge\
  \ operations on board the Leda Maersk  fell short of achieving good \nindustry practice\
  \ in both  planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge \nresource\
  \ management.  \n4.11.1.  The ISM Code  is given mandatory status by Chapter IX\
  \ of the International Convention for the \nSafety of Life at Sea.  Th e ISM Code\
  \ re quires that ship operators have structure d and \ndocumented safety management\
  \ system s that provide for safe ship operating practices and \nestablish safeguards\
  \ based on assessment s of risks to their  ships, personnel and the \nenvironment.\
  \  A safety management system  should ensure compliance with mandat ory rules \n\
  and regulations , and observance of codes, guidelines and standards that are applicable\
  \ to the \noperator's maritime activities.  It should also be a system that is subject\
  \ to verification and \nreview so that continuous improvement is achievable.  \n\
  4.11.2.  Maersk ha d established a safety management system  that document ed how\
  \ the company \nexpect ed its crews to operate its ships.  The safety management\
  \ system  incorporated the \nregulatory requirements of international conventions\
  \ and flag state laws to provide \nproce dures, plans, instructions, guidelines\
  \ and checklists for relevant shipboard operations.   It \nrequired r egular bridge\
  \ discipline meetings to be  held on board to discuss roles and \nresponsibilities\
  \ .  Masters ' own expectations of navigating officers were written in 'Master's\
  \ \nStanding Orders ', which were signed by all of the bridge officers . \n4.11.3.\
  \  An analysis of the safety management system  and the events leading up to the\
  \ grounding \nshow ed that the requirements of sev eral safety management system\
  \  policies were not \nfollowed during the transit of the Lower Otago Harbour. \
  \ The bridge team were  required to \nmonitor the position and movement of the vessel\
  \ closely , and at all times ensure safe under -\nkeel clearance.  Maersk ex pected\
  \ its bridge team to pay full attention to the safe navigation of \nthe vessel,\
  \ verify position fixing by more than one method , monitor the cross -track error26\
  \ and \nverify correct settings and alarms on the ECDIS.  \n4.11.4.  The operator's\
  \ procedure for navigating ' under normal circumstances' required the officer of\
  \ \nthe watch to verify the ship's position by more than one method, if possible,\
  \ and attend \nactivated alarms and alerts immediately.  It specifically stated\
  \ that the officer of the watch \nshould not rely solely on alarms and their effectiveness.\
  \  However, when the off -track alert \nactivated  and was then acknowledged,  the\
  \ voyage data recorder27 audio playback revealed \nthat the alert was not communicated\
  \ to the rest of the bridge team.   \n                                         \

  \  The Leda Maersk  was required to undergo  three navigational audits each year\
  \ , with at least \none conducted by a superintendent .28  Two of the  most recent\
  \  navigational audits had been  \nconducted by the master ; they had  rated the\
  \ vessel's compliance with navigational aspects of \nthe safety management system\
  \  at 100%.  \n4.11.6.  The third audit had been  conducted by a  superintendent\
  \ in February 2018 . The audit  had \nscored the implementation of navigation and\
  \ bridge resource management  aspects highly.  \nHowever, t he audit had identified\
  \ some areas where shipboard practices fell short of Maersk's \nexpectations - namely\
  \ lapses in logbook entries, the recording of navigation warnings and \nknowledge\
  \ of the ship's EC DIS risk assessment.  T he audit had rated the Leda Maers k at\
  \ 88% ,  \nwith a roo m-for-improvement score of 12%  - and it can be seen that\
  \ the greatest shortfall in \ncompliance was concerned with bridge team management,\
  \ responsibility and authority.  The \naudit had been  conducted while the Leda\
  \ Maersk  was operated by a different crew  from  the \none involved in this accident\
  \ .  \n4.11.7.  A closer look at the February audit identifie d the areas where\
  \ the auditor  had found that \nimprovement was required.  These were:  the crew\
  \ had not been aware of the vessel -specific \nECDIS risk assessm ent; bridge watch\
  \ handover checklists had been  pre-signed ; handover \ninformation had been  limited\
  \ ; and officers had not been recording the at -berth under -keel \nclearance in\
  \ the logbook.  \nSummary of navigation audit checklist - 24-25 February 2018, Bri\

  \ February 2018, Brisbane  - Tauranga  \n4.11.8.  Areas where the Leda Maersk 's\
  \ crew showed strong implementation of the company policy \nwere : comprehensive\
  \ passage planning with optimum ECDIS safety settings ; satisfactory \nposition\
  \ fixing ; knowledge of responsibility when navigating with a pilot on board ; and\
  \ \nprocedures for navigation in confined waters.  The audit findings were not consistent\
  \ with \nwhat was observed in respect of this accident, in which  navigation, watchkeeping\
  \ and bridge \nresource management  procedures were not carried out to the standard\
  \ expected by Maersk.  \n4.11.9.  The paper passage plan allowed a maximum distance\
  \ o ff-track of 370 metres ( 0.2 cables ) in \nthe channel , whereas the ECDIS off\
  \ -track alarm was set at 556 metres ( 0.3 cables ).  When the \nECDIS off -track\
  \ al ert activated , no alarm  could be heard on the voyage data recorder  audio\
  \  - \nso it is about as likely as not  that the ECDIS audible alarms had been muted.\

  \ in Maersk's \npolicy and guidance documents, nor were they optimised to give the\

  \  in Figure 5 , which is known \nas the shallow pattern, indicates \"non -navigable\"\
  \ water that is shallower  than the safety \ncontour programmed into the ECDIS.\

  \   Figures 10 and 11 show how the ECDIS display can be optimised to give the bridge\

  4.11.12.  An audit provides  a snapshot of a ship's operating culture , and the\
  \ previous crew  had scored \nwell in the fields relating to safe navigating procedures\
  \ when the ship was audited in February \n2018.  However, there were indicators\
  \ then that not all policies and procedures were  being  \nfollowed as intended\
  \ by the operator.  This, in combination with the non -adherence to other \naspects\
  \ of the polic ies and procedures leading up to the grounding , is an indication\
  \ that the \nprocedural failures may not  have been confined to this one accident,\
  \ and that the operator will \nneed to review the standard of navigation under pilotage\
  \ for all its crews to ensure that \nindustry good practice is being achieved .\
  \ \nThe port operator  \nSafety issue -  Port Otago's safety management system fell\
  \ short of achieving good industry \nstandard s for pilot training outlined in maritime\
  \ rules, or fully achieving the principles of safety \nmanagement systems outlined\
  \ in the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety C ode. \n4.11.13.  The New Zealand\
  \ Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code is a voluntary arrangement between \nMaritime\
  \ New Zealand, local government councils and port operators.  The code sets mutually\
  \  \nagreed  national standard s for marine safety and pollution prevention within\
  \ the ports and \nharbours of New Zealand.  Under the code, port operators, councils,\
  \ harbourmasters, Maritime \nNew Zealand and the Ministry of Transport work together\
  \ to achieve th ose standards .  \n4.11.14.  The code is b ased on the underlying\
  \ principles of  safety  management systems, where policies \nand procedures result\
  \ in hazards being identified and risk s being appropriately  managed.   \nSafety\
  \ management systems must result in full compliance with all maritime rules and\
  \ ot her \nmandatory instruments .  However, maritime rules are generally regarded\
  \ as minimum \nrequirements.  A good safety management system should strive to meet\
  \ good, if not best \nindustry standards, which can be found in various industry\
  \ guidelines.  The Port an d Harbour \nNew Zealand Maritime School  \n\n<< Page\
  \ 24 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -203 Marine Safety Code contains such guidelines\
  \  for providers of maritime pilotage services.  \nThere are also several other\
  \ internationally regarded guidelines30 that offer  similar advice . \n4.11.15.\
  \  In New Zealand, e ach port operator has a duty to safely operate , maintain and\
  \ service the port \nand is accountable for the safety of  the port's marine operations.\
  \  \n4.11.16.  Regional councils have a statutory function to ensure mari time safety\
  \ within their region s.  The \nMaritime Transport Act 1994 states that regional\
  \ c ouncils may regulate the ports, harbours , \nwaters and maritime -related activities\
  \ in their region s for the purpose of ensuring maritime \nsafety.   A council can\
  \ delegate some of the navigation safety functions and powers to council -\ncontrolled\
  \ organisations and port o perators.  \n4.11.17.  A regional council may also appoint\
  \ a harbourmaster to manage maritime safety in its region.  \nHarbourmasters have\
  \ functions, duties and operational powers to ensure maritime safety.   \nOtago\
  \ Harbour had not had a full -time harbourmaster for more th an 30 years.  \n4.11.18.\
  \  Otago Regional Council and Port Otago  had been working together to meet the\
  \ standards set \nin the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code.  However, at the time\
  \ of the Leda Maersk 's \ngrounding, Port Otago had not yet been considered as meet\
  \ ing those  standards.  The \nharbourmaster  was new in the position and  Port\
  \ Otago  was undergoing  operation al change \nfollowing two recent accidents involving\
  \ its pilots.  Policies, procedures and risk assessments \nwere being updated .\
  \ \n4.11.19.  Port Otago's pilot training programm e was outlined in its pilot training\
  \ and proficiency plan, as \nrequired by Maritime Rules Part 90.  However, aspects\
  \ of the plan, such as annual  \nassessments  and pilot peer reviews , were not\
  \ f ollowed .  For example, t he pilot on board the \nLeda Maersk had not been subject\
  \ to an annual assessment  or peer review  since 2012.  \nAdditionally, the pilots\
  \ were issued with the new  ChannelPilot PPUs , but were not given \nadditional\
  \ training in its use .  \n4.11.20.  Within the space of two years, three of Port\
  \ Otago's pilots had conduc ted pilotage on vessels \nthat ran aground.  Port O\
  \ tago had introduced the use of C hannel Pilot PPUs as a safety action, \nbut had\
  \ not at the time of this grounding  provided the pilots with in -depth training\
  \ in their use.  \nPort Otago relied on previous training  provided for the older\
  \ HarbourPilot units .  Port Otago  \nchose  to delay the ChannelPilot training\
  \ until the pilots had some more personal experience \nwith the new units.   There\
  \ was no formal policy on the use of the PPUs , nor were  there any \nprocedures\
  \ for maintaining  and updating the PPUs . \n4.11.21.  PPUs can be useful aid s\
  \ to navigation.  Their accuracy is well suited to monitoring the progress \nof\
  \ large ships in narrow channels, and they provide a useful independent check of\
  \ a ship's \nprogress.  However, if pilots are t o use them, there should be a robust\
  \ system for ensuring \ntheir accuracy and the pilots should be fully trained and\
  \ proficient in their use.  \n4.11.22.  As well as  having made  the changes in\
  \ progress at the time of the grounding, Port Otago has \ntaken a number of initia\
  \ tives in response to the grounding, which are outlined in section 7 of \nthis\
  \ report.  A recommendation has been made to complete the change process to fully\
  \ meet \nindustry good practice.  \n  \n                                       \

  \ The Leda Maersk  was negotiating a left -hand turn in the channel when it deviated\
  \ from the \nintended track  and grounded , under the influence of : tide; helm\
  \ ordered by the harbour pilot; \nand interaction between the ship's hull and the\
  \ left bank of the channel . \n5.2. Neither the harbour pilot nor the ship's bridge\
  \ team r ecognised that the Leda Maersk  was \ndeviating from the planned track\
  \ . This was  because they were not fully using the electronic \nnavigation aids,\
  \ all of which clearly showed the ship deviating from the centre of the channel\
  \ . \n5.3. The entire bridge team was primar ily navigating 'by eye' .  Navigating\
  \ a large ship in narrow \nchannels, at night, using visual (line -of-sight) navigation\
  \ only increases the  risk of the ship \ngrounding  owing to  the bridge team losing\
  \ situational awareness . \n5.4. The standard of bridge resource man agement on\
  \ the bridge of  the Leda Maersk  fell short of \nindustry good practice.  \n5.5.\
  \ The Leda Maersk  bridge team were not fully following the company policies and\
  \ procedures \nfor navigating in pilotage waters  \n5.6. At the time of the grounding,\
  \  Port Otago's policies, procedures and compliance monitoring of \npilotage operations\
  \ fell short of achieving  industry standards for pilot training outlined in \n\
  maritime rules , or fully achieving  the principles of  safety management systems\
  \  outlined in the  \nNew Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code . \n \n  \n\
