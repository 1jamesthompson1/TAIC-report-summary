","0.0","15.0","The report indicates that the bridge team and the pilot were primarily navigating ""by eye"" and did not fully utilize electronic navigation aids, which ""clearly showed the ship deviating from the centre of the channel"" (5.2). This suggests a reliance on expected visual cues without verification from electronic aids, which is a form of human error and assumption.
","0.0","10.0","While the pilot and bridge team were experienced and qualified (4.1.6), the report notes that the bridge team was not fully following company policies and procedures for navigating in pilotage waters (5.5). This indicates a potential gap in training or competency regarding adherence to safety procedures during pilotage.
","0.0","10.0","The pilot had not received additional training on the new ChannelPilot PPUs and there was no formal policy on their use (4.11.20). This lack of training and familiarity with the new equipment could have contributed to the accident.
","0.0","20.0","The report highlights deficiencies in bridge resource management, including a lack of effective teamwork and communication, which are core components of CRM (4.6, 4.9). The bridge team did not work cohesively to monitor the ship's progress and did not communicate critical information, such as the ECDIS off-track alert (4.9.1).
","0.0","15.0","The Leda Maersk's bridge team did not adhere to the company's safety management system requirements, such as closely monitoring the vessel's position and ensuring safe under-keel clearance (4.11.3). This lack of adherence to safety procedures was a significant factor in the grounding.
","0.0","5.0","The report suggests that there may have been a lack of a strong safety culture, as indicated by the bridge team not following bridge and navigation aspects of the safety management system and the port operator's shortcomings in pilot training and safety management system development (4.10.1, 4.11.19).
","0.0","5.0","The report does not explicitly mention a failure in risk management and analysis as a contributing factor. However, the lack of an agreed passage plan and the failure to monitor the ship's progress against the plan suggest a deficiency in managing the risks associated with the pilotage operation (4.4.2).
","0.0","5.0","Port Otago's safety management system did not fully meet industry standards for pilot training as outlined in maritime rules, indicating a gap in regulatory compliance (4.11.19). This contributed to the accident by allowing deficiencies in pilot training and proficiency to persist.
","0.0","10.0","The loss of situational awareness by the bridge team and the pilot was a significant factor in the grounding. They did not recognize the ship's deviation from the planned track due to not fully using electronic navigation aids (5.2, 5.3).
","0.0","0.0","The report does not provide information suggesting that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the grounding of the Leda Maersk.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of equipment failure due to lack of maintenance or inspection that contributed to the accident in the provided document.
","0.0","5.0","The pilot's reliance on visual navigation and underutilization of electronic aids such as PPUs and ECDIS indicates a potential issue with the use of automation. The pilot did not fully utilize the accuracy of these aids, which could have prevented the grounding (4.2.12).
","0.0","0.0","Weather conditions are not mentioned as a contributing factor to the grounding in the provided document.
","0.0","0.0","While there were issues with alerting and communication of critical information such as the ECDIS off-track alert, the report does not frame these as a breakdown in communication but rather as a failure in bridge resource management and adherence to procedures (4.9.1).
","0.0","0.0","There are no additional safety themes identified in the provided document that contributed to the accident outside of the predefined themes.","0.0","true","N/A"
