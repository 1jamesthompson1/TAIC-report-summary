Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Inadequate passage planning and execution: The report highlights that the bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk fell short of achieving good industry practice for both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management. This includes not following the agreed passage plan, relying too much on visual navigation, and not utilizing electronic navigation aids effectively.

2. Lack of situational awareness: The bridge team, including the pilot, failed to fully use the available electronic navigation aids, resulting in a loss of situational awareness. They did not recognize that the ship was deviating from the planned track, leading to the grounding. This lack of situational awareness was exacerbated by navigating primarily by eye and not verifying their observations with the ship's electronic navigation systems.

3. Complacency and inadequate teamwork: The report suggests that complacency played a role in the grounding, as the bridge team may have relaxed when the pilot embarked and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right. There were indications that the bridge team was not truly working as one team, with the pilot using his own electronic navigation aid (PPU) without close monitoring from the rest of the team. This lack of effective teamwork and reliance on the pilot as a single point of failure contributed to the grounding.
