Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate passage planning and execution: The report highlights that the bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk fell short of achieving good industry practice for both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management. This includes not following the agreed passage plan, relying too much on visual navigation, and not utilizing electronic navigation aids effectively.

2. Lack of situational awareness: The bridge team, including the pilot, failed to fully use the available electronic navigation aids, resulting in a loss of situational awareness. They did not recognize that the ship was deviating from the planned track, leading to the grounding. This lack of situational awareness was exacerbated by navigating primarily by eye and not verifying their observations with the ship's electronic navigation systems.

3. Complacency and inadequate teamwork: The report suggests that complacency played a role in the grounding, as the bridge team may have relaxed when the pilot embarked and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right. There were indications that the bridge team was not truly working as one team, with the pilot using his own PPU and not effectively communicating with the rest of the bridge team. This lack of teamwork and complacency contributed to the grounding.

4. Organizational factors: The report highlights shortcomings in the safety management systems of both the ship operator and the port operator. The ship's crew did not fully follow the company's policies and procedures for navigating in pilotage waters, and the port operator's safety management system fell short of achieving good industry standards for pilot training and safety management. These organizational factors contributed to the inadequate bridge operations and overall safety culture.

5. Human factors: The report identifies several human factors that contributed to the grounding, including teamwork, complacency, situational awareness, alerting, and safety culture. These factors highlight the importance of effective communication, vigilance, and a strong safety culture in preventing accidents.

6. Inadequate training and procedures: The report points out that the pilot had not undergone an annual assessment or peer review since 2012, and the port operator had not provided in-depth training on the use of the new ChannelPilot PPUs. This lack of training and formal procedures for maintaining and updating the PPUs contributed to the inadequate use of electronic navigation aids and the loss of situational awareness.
