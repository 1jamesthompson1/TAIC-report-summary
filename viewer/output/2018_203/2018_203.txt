The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.   The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail a ccidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding  similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by inf orming 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 10 June 2018, the Danish -registered container ship Leda Maersk  arrived off the Port of 
Otago, embarked a harbour pilot, and proceeded up the Lower Harbour channel at about 
1800, during the hours of darkness.  The master, officer of the watch and helmsman were on 
the bridge, with the harbour pilot directing the course  and speed of the ship.  
1.2. The ship was rounding the final bend in the channel before reaching its berth, when a 
combination of factors caused it to deviate from the planned track in the centre of the 
channel, and ground on the left channel bank.  Nobody was injured and damage to the ship 
was confined to scraping of the paintwork on the hull.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that neither the harbour 
pilot nor the ship's bridge team recognised that the Leda Maersk  was deviating  from the 
planned track .  This was  because they were all primarily navigating using visual cues outside 
the ship, rather than fully using the electronic navigation aids, all of which clearly showed the 
ship deviating from the centre of the channel.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the standard of bridge resource management on the bridge 
of the Leda Maersk  fell short of industry good practice and that the Leda Maersk  bridge team 
were not fully following the company policies and procedures for navigating  in pilotage waters.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that, at the time of the grounding, Port Otago's policies, 
procedures and compliance monitoring of pilotage operations fell short of meeting good 
industry standards outlined in maritime rules and the New Zeala nd Port and Harbour Marine 
Safety Code . 
1.6. The Commission recommended  that the Chief Executive of Maersk Line  A/S review the 
implementation of  the company's  safety management system across its fleet with respect to 
navigation and pilotage and take the necessa ry steps to ensure a high standard is achieved by 
all crews on all its ships . 
1.7. The Commission also recommended  that t he Chief Executive of Port Otago continue to take 
the necessary action to ensure its pilotage operations meet good industry practice and the  
guidance provided in the New Zealand Port and Harbour  Marine  Safety Code.  
1.8. The Commission repeats  three key lessons  made in a previous report:  
 there must be an absolute agreement and shared understanding between the vessel's 
bridge team and the pilot as to  the passage plan and monitoring against that plan  
 vessels' bridge teams must actively promote and use the concept of bridge resource 
management, including the incorporation of pilots into the bridge teams, to manage 
voyages properly  
 a vessel's electronic chart display and information system  is an important system for 
monitoring the progress of the vessel and warning the bridge team when things could 
go wrong.  It is essential that it be configured correctly for the phase of navigation and 
the proximity to navigation hazards.  
1.9. The Commission identified one new key lesson : 
 portable pilot units can be useful aids to navigation and their accuracy is well suited to 
allow ing pilots an independent means of monitoring the progress of large ships in 
narrow channels.  However, if pilots are to use them, they should be fully trained and 
proficient in their use, and there should be a robust system for ensuring the accuracy of 
the e quipment.

 Final Report MO -2018 -203 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Maritime New Zealand notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission)  
of the grounding on 10 June 2018.  The Commission opened an inquiry the same day under 
section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident I nvestigation Commission Act 1990, and appointed 
an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 11 June two investigators and one data recovery specialist travelled to Port Chalmers and 
boarded the Leda Maersk  to conduct interviews and collect evidence.  The ship had been 
subject to an underwater hull inspection that morning and no significant damage had been  
found.  Following an inspection by a Lloyd's Register surveyor, the Leda Maersk  was able to 
depart later that same day.  
2.3. On 12 June the investigators interviewed the har bour pilot and collected evidence from the ir 
portable pilot unit  (PPU) .2 
2.4. On 22 June further documentation was requested from  the operator  and Port Otago.  
2.5. On 10 July the Commission received the Maersk Line  A/S internal investigation report.  
2.6. On 24 July two investigators travelled to Port Otago to conduct a follow -up interview with the 
pilot,  and to interview  the General Manager of Infrastructure and Marine and  also the Chief 
Information Officer.  An electronic copy of the Harbour Control recor ding from the time of the 
incident was also obtained.  
2.7. On 23 September the Commission received the Port Otago internal investigation report.  
2.8. On 18 April 2019  the Commission approved a draft report for sending to eight interested 
persons for comment.  
2.9. The Commission received five responses, which included two submissions.  The Commission 
considered the submissions, and changes as a result of these have been included in the final 
report.  
2.10.  Between 26 June 2019 and 25 September 2019 the Commission liaised with Port Otago  to 
clarify recommendation 006/19 and subsequently received a formal response on 25 
September 2019.  
2.11.  On 7 October 2019  the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The Leda Maersk  is a fully cellular 'L class'3 container ship,  registered in Denmark and  
operated by Maersk Line A/S  (Maersk) .  The ship was operating on  a regular service between 
Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand .  
3.1.2.  At the time of the accident the Leda Maers k carried  a multinational crew of 2 4. 
3.1.3.  The vessel departed Lyttelton on 9 June 2018 bound for Port Chalmers.  The coastal passage 
to the Otago Harbour pilot station was routine, the weather was fair and the ship had no 
reported defects.  The  vessel's  arriva l draught4 was 10.8 metres  on an even keel5. 
3.1.4.  The predicted time of low water at Port Chalmers on 10 June was 1842  at a height of 0.4 
metres.  The predicted time of  sunset was 1659 . 
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  At 1720 on 10 June , the Leda Maersk arrived at the Port Otago pilot station  'Alpha '.  The 
bridge team comprised  the master, the chief officer and the helmsman.  
3.2.2.  The pilot boarded the ship at 1735 and was taken directly to the navigation bridge  to join the 
bridge team .  The pilot was carrying a PPU .  Before it could be  used for the pilotage6, it was 
required to be set up using information from the ship's automatic identification system.  The 
pilot set up  the PPU and then exchange d information  with the master  (this is referred to as the 
master/pilot exchange) .  The pilot  explained  each item on the Port Otago master/pilot 
exchange form , which included : the planned inward transit of the Lower Otago Harbour ; the 
berthing plan ; the use of tugs ; and the manoeuvring characteristics of the Leda Maersk .   
3.2.3.  The pilot  encouraged the bridge team to challenge  them  if they had any concerns with the 
piloting a nd explain ed that the ship's crew were still responsible for monitoring the ship's 
progress against the passage plan .7  The ship's passage plan was displayed on the electronic 
chart display and information system ( ECDIS ).  The Port Otago passage plan was displayed on 
the pilot's PPU.  Both plans were similar in that they broadly required the ship to stay near the 
centre of the narrow channel, but there were subtle diff erences in the radius of the turns in 
the channel.  
3.2.4.  The pilot then took the conn8 and a t 1754 the Leda Maersk  entered Otago Harbour .  The sun 
had set and it was dark, but  meteorological visibility was good.  
3.2.5.  Between 1806 and 1810, w hen the ship was lined up  with the Cross Channel leading lights9 
(see Figure 1) , the pilot 's PPU indicat ed that the ship was slightly off track.  The pilot checked 
the settings on the PPU and found that there was an 18 -metre offset to starboard10 to allow 
for the position of the PP U aerial  in relation to the ship's centreline .  The offset w as caus ing 
the PPU to indicate that the ship's position was 18 metres, approximately half the ship's 
breadth, further to port11 than it really was.  The pilot was unable to remove the offset  so 
decided to discontinue using the PPU for monitoring the ship's progress.  Instead the pilot

the bridge team that he had stopped using the PPU.

3.2.6.  The port tugs  Otago  and Taiaroa  met the Leda Maersk  between  Acheron Point and Pulli ng 
Point (see Figure 1 ).  In order to proceed at an appropriate speed for securing12 the tugs , the 
pilot requested dead slow ahead on the ship's engine.   At 1819 the Taiaroa  was secured to  
the Leda Maersk 's stern13 and at 1824,  just after the Leda Maersk  had passed Acheron Point, 
the tug Otago  was secured on the starboard bow .14   
3.2.7.  The passage plan required  the Leda Maersk to follow the  centre of the  channel as it cu rved to 
the left  (to port) after Acheron Point .  The speed of the ship was about six knots15 at that time.  
As the ship made the turn to port it started to move left of the planned track and  was no 
longer in the centre  of the channel  (see Figure 2). 
3.2.8.  In spite of the ship already being left of the planned track, the pilot gave a succession of large 
helm orders to port  (between 20 and 35 degrees ' rudder angle ).  As the Leda Maersk  
responded to the port rudder , the deviation left of the planned track increased , causing  the 
off-track al ert16 on the  ECDIS  to activat e.  The ECDIS log recorded that the off -track alert had 
activated and that a  member of the bridge team  had acknowledged  it.  However,  the 
information was not passed on  to the other members of the bridge team.  
3.2.9.  The Leda Maersk 's speed gradually slowed as it made  the turn to port  and deviated further 
left of the centre of the channel.  At approximately 1828  the speed decreased to 2.5 knots 
when the bridge team felt the ship  heel over t o starboard.  At that point t he master asked the 
pilot why the engine was still on dead slow ahead.  The p ilot responded by ordering the 
engines to increase to  slow ahead .  However, the ship continued to lose speed , and by 1829

 the ship had come to rest  on the port side of the channel between  beacons 22 and 24 (see 
Figure 3). 
3.2.10.  The pilot saw that the ship was quite close to the port -side beacons and mention ed this to the 
master.  The master  then  realised  that the ship had  probably run aground , and stopped the 
engine . 
3.2.11.  The pilot radioed the tugs and gave instructions for them to pull  the Leda Maersk  back into 
the centre  of the channel.  With the aid of  the ship's bow thruster17, the tugs were able to pull 
the ship clear of the seabed and the pilot repositioned  the Leda Maersk  to mid -channel . 
3.2.12.  The pilot report ed the grounding to harbour control, then  continued to manoeuvre the ship to 
its container terminal berth without further incident.   The Leda Maersk  was all secure at its 
berth at 1930.  
3.2.13.  The following morning a diver made an  inspection  of the hull of the Leda Maersk  and noted 
superfic ial scrapes and scratches in the hull paint .  The  propeller and the rudder  were 
undamaged .

 3.3. Personnel  
3.3.1.  The master held an unlimited  master mariner's certificate of competency, issued under the 
International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for 
Seafarers (STCW).  The master's sea -going career exceeded  20 years, all on container  ships , 
with the previous  six years  in the rank of master . 
3.3.2.  The c hief officer had recently achieved  an unlimited master mariner's certificate of 
competency issued under STCW.  The chief officer kept the 1600 to 2000 watch when the 
ship was at sea and was the officer of the watch for the Leda Maersk 's arrival at Port 
Chalmers.  
3.3.3.  The master and the chief officer had sailed together on the Leda Maersk , on the same Asia, 
Australia, New Zealand service fo r the previous  two years.  Both the master and the chief 
officer were familiar with transiting the Lower Harbour to Port Chalmers .  
3.3.4.  The pilot held an unlimited master mariner's certificate of competency and  an Otago Harbour 
unrestricted pilot licence.  The pilot  had been  a Port Otago  harbour pilot for 19 years . Prior to 
being employed by Port Otago  the pilot had been a pilot -exempt master on ships that regularly 
called at Dunedin . 
3.4. Otago Harbour and Port Otago  
3.4.1.  Port Chalmers lies on the northern side of Otago Harbour and is  accessible from the sea via a 
navigable channel  through the Lower Otago Harbour .  Maritime Rule s Part 90 (Pilotage) 
requires vessels over 500 gross tonnes (GT) to carry a 'pilot who holds a current, appropriate 
pilot licence ' when entering Otago Harbour.  
3.4.2.  A programme of regul ar and targeted dredging ensured that the channel maintained  a depth 
of 13.5 metres.   Admiralty Sailing Direction s New Zealand Pilot  states that : 
The dredged channel through Lower Harbour is marked on both sides by light 
beacons some of  which stand up to ¼ cable18 outside the channel.  Their 
positions and characteristics can be seen on the chart.19 
3.4.3.  Port Otago provides port  facilities and services  such as pilots and tug boats  in Otago Harbour . 
3.4.4.  Otago Regional Council  is responsible for the s afety of navigation in the region's waters.  In 
early 2016 Otago Regional Council appointed a consultant to carry out a strategic review of 
maritime safety in Otago Harbour.  After 30 years without a  full-time harbourmaster t he review 
recommended the need for change , and as a result a full-time harbourmaster was appointed 
in 201 7. 
3.5. The New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code  
3.5.1.  The New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code is a voluntary national standard for 
the safe management of marine activi ties in ports and harbours.  Th e code is intended to 
apply, as a minimum, to any harbour area or commercial port with compulso ry pilotage.  It 
covers all activities associated with the safe movement of ships entering, leaving and 
navigating within ports an d harbours.  
3.5.2.  The code  is administer ed by a secretariat that engages with industry stakeholders and 
Maritime New Zealand to monitor  the implementation of, and compliance with , the code.  A 
panel of peers from ports, harbours and Maritime New Zealand determin es whether a port 
meets the standards of th e code by reviewing the port's safety management system .  At the 
time of the Leda Maersk 's accident the panel considered that Otago Harbour and Port Otago 
had more improvements to make before they could be considered compliant with the code .  
Port Otago has since attained the required standard  for code compliance .

 Final Report MO -2018 -203 3.6. Electronic navigation equipment  
3.6.1.  The Leda Maersk held a valid Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificate and was fitted with t he 
navigation equipment  required by the  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea .  
3.6.2.  The ship's primary navigation system  was an ECDI S.  It was fitted with two independent  
Transas Navi -Sailor 4000 ECDIS units , which meant  the ship was not r equired to carry paper 
charts.   The ECDIS units were continually supplied with satellite -derived positions from two 
independent global positioning system (GPS) units.  In addition to GPS fixing , the equipment 
allowed the officer of the watch to fix the vessel 's position using lin es of position derived from 
visual bearings and radar ranges.  
3.6.3.  The master and chief officer had both completed approved training  specific to the Transas  
ECDIS units  fitted  on board.  
3.6.4.  The Leda Maersk  was also fitted with two radar s.  
3.6.5.  The pilot carried a Navic om Dynamics  ChannelPilot PPU, which showed the vessel's predicted 
path  on its own electronic chart display.  The equipment 's main benefit is that it enables pilots  
to navigate any ship using navigation equipment they are familiar with, rather than rely on the 
various  types and makes of equipment found on board modern ship s.  This type of  PPU is 
initially  plugged  in to a ship's automatic i dentification  system  in order for it to synchronise with  
the ship's navigation systems.  The PPU  establishe s the ship's heading and stabilise s its own 
internal gyroscopic compass.  Once the compass  has stabilised , it operates independently of 
the ship's compass  and display s the ship's actual and predicted position s based on  its own 
internal GPS and gyro heading . 
3.6.6.  A PPU is not mandatory equipment.  In 2017 Port Otago provided ChannelPilot PPU s to all its 
pilots.  Before then the pilots had had access to two HarbourPilot  PPUs, earlier  model s than  
the ChannelPilot.  The p ilots had been trained to use the HarbourPilot PPU s, but Port Otago  
left it to the pilots' discretion on whether to use them .  When t he ChannelPilot PPU s were 
provided, Port Otago encouraged its  pilots to use them , but no additional tra ining was given.  
3.7. Navigation with a pilot embarked - regulations and standards  
3.7.1.  In addition to  gaining their STCW certification, maritime pilots are trained in ship handling and 
tug management .  Pilots must also retain profound  knowledge of all navigational aspects of 
the pilotage area and port facilities.  A pilot effectively becomes part of the bridge team for the 
act of pilotage. Their specialist skills and local knowledge of the pilotage area enhance the 
capability of the bridge team.  However, t heir presence does not relieve the master and crew  
of their duties and responsibilities for the safe  navigation of the ship.   
3.7.2.  The International Maritime Organization's Resolution A .96020 states that : 
masters  and bridge officers have a duty to support the pilot and ensure that his/her 
actions are monitored at all times  
and that : 
the master, bridge officer and pilot share a responsibility for good communications 
and understanding of each other's role for the safe conduct of the vessel in pilotage 
waters.

 3.7.3.  The Inter national Chamber of Shipping  is the principal international trade ass ociation for the 
shipping industry .  It develops best practice and guidance for ships'  bridge operations and 
publishes them  in the International Chamber of Shipping's Bridge Procedures Guide21, which 
is used by ship operators globally .  It stresses that eff ective co -ordination between the bridge 
team and the pilot is essential for safe pilotage.  It also states  that: 
the presence of a Pilot does not relieve the Master o r the Bridge Team from their 
duties and responsibilities for the safe conduct of the ship.  
3.7.4.  Under the International Safety Management Code (ISM Code) , ship operators must have 
approved safety management system s that include explanations of how their policies and 
procedures will ensure compliance with all relevant rules and conventions.  The oper ator's 
policy for navigating with a pilot on board  (Appendix 1) explain ed the requirement for the 
master and the officer of the watch to maintain responsibilit y for the safe conduct of the 
vessel.  
3.7.5.  The Otago Lower Harbour Pilot age Guide  states that the ship's bridge team are required to 
continue their duties of maintaining a proper lookout, plotting the ship's position, ensuring 
that the pilot's helm and engine orders are followed correctly and challenging the pilot if they 
are uncertain  of the pilot's orders or intentions.  This requirement is referred to in the 
master /pilot  exchange checklist .

 Final Report MO -2018 -203 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Historically, planning a ship's voyage primarily focused on the pilot -to-pilot leg of the voyage - 
between  when  a pilot disembarked at the departure port to when a pilot embarked at the 
arrival port.  
4.1.2.  In recent years there has been industry acknowledgment that the portion of the voyage that 
carries the biggest risk is when the ship is navigating confined waters , characterised  by 
navigation hazards , shallow water, restricted sea room and high traffic density.   The 
requirement to carry a maritime pilot is a safety measure to reduce  the risk of navigational 
accidents in designated pilotage areas.   
4.1.3.  Voyage or passage planning and its princip al elements  - appraisal, planning, execution and 
monitoring  - are fundamental in ensur ing the safety of a vessel whilst on passage.  Voyage 
planning is now required to be conducted from berth to berth, which encompasses the 
pilotage  operation.  
4.1.4.  In New Zealand it is compulsory for large ships  to carry marine pilot s in designated pilotage 
areas.22  A significant challenge for  the industry is to change a culture whereby ships ' crews 
often relax when a pilot embarks and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right.  The goal is 
to achieve consistency in standards and operating procedures for the ship operator and the 
pilotage provider , in order for the people  to merge and work as one team when a pilot is on 
board.  
4.1.5.  The Commission has published four accident reports23 in the past five years involving  ships 
that have run aground, all due in part to poor standards of bridge resource management and 
the pilots and br idge crew not sharing the same concept s of the passage plan s.  This 
grounding has similarities . 
4.1.6.  The following analysis considers  how and why the Leda Maersk  ran aground whilst under the 
conduct of an experienced, qualified pilot working with an experienced , qualified  bridge team .  
It also discusses the following safety issues:  
 Port Otago's safety management system fell short of achieving good  industry  standards 
for pilotage operation s 
 The bridge operations  on board the Leda Maersk  fell short of achieving good industry 
practice for both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge 
resource management . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The ship was entering Port Otago in darkness , proceeding at slow speed into the last of the 
ebb tide . 
4.2.2.  The pilot was standing at the front of the bridge , just to port of  the ship's  centreline .  Having 
discounted the positional information provided by the  PPU, the pilot was  navigating primarily 
by visual means, using the channel beacon lights and sets of lead ing lights along the shore  to 
judge the ship's position in the channel .  The pilot was , however , still referring to the PPU from 
time to time to monitor the ship's rate of turn.  
4.2.3.  The Leda Maersk  pass ed Acheron Point where the channel began curving  left (see Figure 4).  
At this point  the navigable channel was app roximat ely 185  metres  across .  The Leda Maersk 's 
beam of  37.5  metres  left only about 73.8 m etres  of safe water either side of the ship  when it 
was in the centre of the channel .

Final Report MO -2018 -203 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.2.4.  The Leda Maersk  was proceeding at a speed of about six knots at Acheron Point , which was in 
accordance with the recommended speed profile contained in the  Otago  Lower Harbour 
Pilotage Guide.  The pilot's previous experience with 'L-class' vessels was that it would be 
difficult to turn the ship unless the ship was  carrying sufficient speed . 
4.2.5.  The Leda Maersk  was in the centre of the channel and on track when the left turn 
commenced.  It was the pilot's intention to keep the ship in the centre of the channel through 
the turn .  The pilot's expectation was that a large amount of port helm would be required to 
make the turn .  However, the ship started to move left of the intended track .  There are a 
number of factors  that could have contributed to  this: 
 the influence of the port rudder being applied  
 any residual ebb tide  pushing the ship from right to left  
 interaction between the ship's hull and the seabed and/or channel banks (sides)  
 a combination of some or all of these factors . 
4.2.6.  The ECDIS display (Figure 5), the radar display (Figure 6) and the pilot's PPU (Figure 7) clearly 
show ed this drift towards the left bank of the channel .

<< Page 15 >>
 4.2.7.  As the left turn continued , a large amount of port helm was being applied (Figure 4) .  The 
heading of the ship changed marginally to port  and the ship continued moving further left of 
the planned  track.  When it had deviated approximately 55  metres  left of the planned track , 
the ECDIS off -track alert activated .  The aler t was informing the bridge team that the ship had 
reached the pre -set cross -track limit.24  However, this important information was not brought 
to the attention of the master or the pilot.  
4.2.8.  As the heading of  the ship altered to port , the ship move d further l eft of  the planned track  and 
went  very close to the left bank  of the channel .  Once the ship came close to the left bank , at 
about beacon  20A, it is about as likely as not that a suction effect was created around the 
underwater mid -section and towards the stern.  This is an example of a phenomenon  known 
as interaction.  It is the result of  a ship displacing water  as it moves forward in a narrow 
channel .  The water increas es in velocity  as it is forced t hrough the narrow gap between the 
hull and the left bank .  The increase in water velocity causes a suction effect, drawing the hull 
into the side of the bank.  The pilot was expecting to need  high rudder angles to make the 
turn.  However, it is likely that the pilot would also have been unknowingly having to overcome 
any forces drawing the ship's stern into the left bank . 
4.2.9.  When the ship initially started to swing to port, the bridge was still travelling out near the 
centre channel.  However,  the bow, 190  metres forward of the bridge , was already angled 
towards and closing  with the left channel bank.   The pilot was standing on the bridge  focused 
mainly on the beacons either side of the channel and a set of leadin g lights ahead  of the ship  
in the vicinity of  the swinging basin .25 
4.2.10.  Additionally, containers had been stacked six tiers high near the extremities of the ship.  On 
the L-class container ship s this was kno wn to cause bridge team s to lose sight of channel 
beacons passing close by the ship s.  As the ship drew closer to the left bank, from where the 
pilot was standing the pilot would have lost sight of the left bank channel markers below the 
container stack s.  Figure 8 shows an example of how containers stacked in this manner can 
affect visibility.

4.2.11.  In the dark and navigating only by visual means, the bridge team and the pilot appear ed to 
have lost awareness of the factors affecting the progress of the ship , until the ship heeled to 
starboard and stopped in spite of its propeller still turning ahead.  
4.2.12.  The grounding is an example of why it is not appropriate to use visual navigation alone (often 
referred to as line -of-sight navigation) when manoeuvring large sh ips in narrow channels, and 
in the dark.  With so little margin for error, it would have been appropriate to utili se fully the 
accuracy of electronic navigation aids such as PPUs and ECDIS.  Had the pilot done so, the 
ship's depart ure from the intended tra ck would have  been  readily apparent in time to avoid 
the grounding.  
4.2.13.  Equally, had the ship's crew been monitoring the ship 's passage, they could have alerted the 
pilot immediately to the ship departing from the agreed passage plan.  These aspects are  
covere d in the following section s. 
4.3. Bridge resource management and human factors  
4.3.1.  The International Chamber of Shipping Bridge Procedures Guide de scribes an effective bridge 
team as one that "will manage efficiently all the resources that are available and promote  
good communication and teamwork".  An effective bridge team will be able to plan and 
complete a passage from berth to berth and anticipate and respond to any dangerous 
situations and emergencies that may arise during the passage.  
4.3.2.  By sharing information th rough good communication, members of the bridge team can 
support situational awareness and ensure that everybody knows what is happening .  
Developing a good bridge resource management  system will not only spread the workload on 
Bay 40  
beacon

Final Report MO -2018 -203 
<< Page 17 >>
 the bridge, but promote an environment that accepts that errors will happen.  Maritime 
professionals who have bridge resource management  training are taught  to identify such 
errors and act appropriately before they can develop into accident s.   
4.3.3.  The pilot h ad been incorporated into the bridge team through the usual exchanges of 
information that occur when a pilot boards .  The master, the chief officer and the pilot had all 
been trained in bridge resource management  techniques.  During t he pilot/master exchan ge, 
the pilot encourag ed the bridge team to challenge "always" if the y had  any issues  with the 
pilotage .  The master and the chief officer  later said they  were confident that they would have 
spoken up had they been aware of the developing problem, but ever ything  had "looked fine".   
The fundamental reason for everything  "looking fine" to every member of the bridge team as 
the ship deviated from the plan ned track and ran aground is discussed in more detail below.  
4.4. Passage plan  
4.4.1.  The passage plan on the ship 's ECDIS was broadly the same as that which  the pilot had 
loaded on the PPU, but not identical.   In this case the passage plan was uncomplicated , 
keeping the ship in the centre of the channel.  Therefore, the differences between the two 
plans were  not a factor in the grounding.  
4.4.2.  Nevertheless, i t is important for all ac ts of pilotage that there is a single agreed passage plan.  
If there is no agreed plan there is a danger that the pilot and the ship's crew will have differing 
mental concept s of how the pilotage wi ll be performed.  If there is no  agreed passage plan, the 
pilot and ship's crew have no basis for monitoring the ship 's progress and raising interventions 
if the ship deviates from the intended track.  The Commission has published several reports 
where not  working to agreed plan s contributed to ship s running aground.   There are several 
examples published by other investigation agencies as well.  This issue  is the subject of 
several open recommendations , and influenced  the Commission to place  accidents under  
pilotage on its watch list.  
4.5. Human behaviour  
4.5.1.  In order to understand wh at went wrong on the bridge of  the Leda Maersk  that night, it is 
worth considering a series of marine guidance notes published  by the United Kingdom 
Maritime and Coastguard Agency  aimed at providing guidance to the maritime industry on 
human behaviour.  Marine Guidance Note  520 (M) - Human Element Guidance:  The Deadly 
Dozen - 12 Significant People Factors in Maritime Safety aimed to raise  awareness of 12 of 
the mos t prevalent human factors that contribute to maritime accidents.  Identified through 
the Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme , these factors and 
corresponding mitigating actions are summarised in the marine guidance note,  which has 
been reproduced  on ma ny maritime industry websites.   Figure 9 shows a poster that 
encapsulates the se 12 factors.

<< Page 19 >>
  
4.5.2.  Of these 12 factors, at least five stand out as factors contributing to the grounding  of the Leda 
Maersk .  In order of development, they are :  
 teamwork (How well do you really work together?)  
 complacency (Is everything really OK?)  
 situational awareness (Do you really know what's happening?)  
 alerting (Do you really speak up when you should?)  
 culture (Do you really have a good safety culture?) . 
4.6. Teamwork  
4.6.1.  Although the pilot and the ship's crew went through the mo tions of establishing the bridge 
team, there are some indications that they were not truly working as one team.   
4.6.2.  It is about as likely as not that the pilot's use of a PPU led the ship's bridge team to believe 
that the pilot did not need their support beca use he had his own electronic navigation aid.  
Evidence in support of this is that none of the ship's bridge team was closely monitoring the 
radar and ship ECDIS.  Had they been, they would not have been so surprised that the ship 
had run aground .  When a  PPU is a pilot's own equipment , the ship's personnel have no way of 
verifying that the PPU is functioning properly unless the pilot tells them.  In this case the pilot 
did not tell the bridge team that there was some uncertainty about  the accuracy of the PPU, 
which is not consistent with the team approach.  
4.6.3.  Perhaps the most telling point was  that on the reali sation that the ship had run aground, a 
member of the bridge team commented to the pilot , "You appear to have run us aground" . 
4.7. Complacency  
4.7.1.  Complacency is described as "a misplaced feeling that everything is OK" and can arise from 
repeatedly carrying out the same task without prior incident.  
4.7.2.  The Leda Maersk  was a frequent caller to the Port of Otago and its bridge crew were familiar 
with the approaches to  the port.  The fact that none of the bridge team was actively monitoring 
the progress of the ship on the electronic navigation equipment is indicative of their having  
relax ed when the pilot embarked  and put too much faith in the pilot getting it right .  This 
situation effectively risked the pilot's performance becoming a single point of failure , so when 
the pilot experienced the not -abnormal human trait of losing situation al awareness, this 
resulted in the ship running aground . 
4.8. Situational awareness  
4.8.1.  Situat ional awareness can be described as an understanding of what is going on in one's 
surroundings.  If members of a ship's bridge team understand what the ship is doing and what 
is happening around the ship at any one moment, they can predict the effect s of the control 
inputs applied or assess what control inputs need to be changed.  
4.8.2.  Situational awareness is a critical aspect of navigation and can be enhanced and degraded by 
many internal and external influences.  It can be enhanced by electronic navigation aid s, 
monitoring and alarm systems, communication and teamwork .  Convers ely, it can be degraded 
by a lack of communication and teamwork and improper use of electronic systems.  
4.8.3.  The ship  was a t a critical phase of the agreed passage plan , yet none of the bridge team was 
totally aware of the factors influencing the track of the ship towards the left channel bank . 
4.8.4.  The bridge team were all primarily navigating by eye and not verifying that what they were 
seeing  correlated with the information in the ship's electronic navigation system s.  All of the 
electronic navigation aids showed that the Leda Maersk  was off -track  and nearing the limit of 
safe water to port.  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report MO -2018 -203 4.9. Alerting  
4.9.1.  Had the bridge team used all the available  features of ECDIS and radar to mo nitor the ship's 
progress , it is highly likely that they would have seen  that the ship was deviating from its track .  
Likewise , had the ECDIS off -track al ert been communicated to the rest of the bridge team , it 
would have  alerted them  to the fact that the ship was moving away from i ts intended track 
and given them an opportunity to take corrective action  before the vessel grounde d. 
4.10.  Safety culture  
4.10.1.  Culture can be described as the way things are normally done in a group or workplace.  For a 
ship, it is largely driven by the effectiveness of the ship safety management system and the 
overarching safety system owned by the ship operator.  This accident a lone does  not mean 
there was  a poor safety culture.  However , there were  a number of indications that the ship's 
crew were not following the bridge and navigation aspects of the safety management system, 
and that the safety management system for the port o perator had not been fully developed.  
These aspects are discussed in the following sections.  
4.11.  Organisational factors  
The ship operator  
Safety issue - The bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk  fell short of achieving good 
industry practice in both  planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge 
resource management.  
4.11.1.  The ISM Code  is given mandatory status by Chapter IX of the International Convention for the 
Safety of Life at Sea.  Th e ISM Code re quires that ship operators have structure d and 
documented safety management system s that provide for safe ship operating practices and 
establish safeguards based on assessment s of risks to their  ships, personnel and the 
environment.  A safety management system  should ensure compliance with mandat ory rules 
and regulations , and observance of codes, guidelines and standards that are applicable to the 
operator's maritime activities.  It should also be a system that is subject to verification and 
review so that continuous improvement is achievable.  
4.11.2.  Maersk ha d established a safety management system  that document ed how the company 
expect ed its crews to operate its ships.  The safety management system  incorporated the 
regulatory requirements of international conventions and flag state laws to provide 
proce dures, plans, instructions, guidelines and checklists for relevant shipboard operations.   It 
required r egular bridge discipline meetings to be  held on board to discuss roles and 
responsibilities .  Masters ' own expectations of navigating officers were written in 'Master's 
Standing Orders ', which were signed by all of the bridge officers . 
4.11.3.  An analysis of the safety management system  and the events leading up to the grounding 
show ed that the requirements of sev eral safety management system  policies were not 
followed during the transit of the Lower Otago Harbour.  The bridge team were  required to 
monitor the position and movement of the vessel closely , and at all times ensure safe under -
keel clearance.  Maersk ex pected its bridge team to pay full attention to the safe navigation of 
the vessel, verify position fixing by more than one method , monitor the cross -track error26 and 
verify correct settings and alarms on the ECDIS.  
4.11.4.  The operator's procedure for navigating ' under normal circumstances' required the officer of 
the watch to verify the ship's position by more than one method, if possible, and attend 
activated alarms and alerts immediately.  It specifically stated that the officer of the watch 
should not rely solely on alarms and their effectiveness.  However, when the off -track alert 
activated  and was then acknowledged,  the voyage data recorder27 audio playback revealed 
that the alert was not communicated to the rest of the bridge team.

 4.11.5.  The Leda Maersk  was required to undergo  three navigational audits each year , with at least 
one conducted by a superintendent .28  Two of the  most recent  navigational audits had been  
conducted by the master ; they had  rated the vessel's compliance with navigational aspects of 
the safety management system  at 100%.  
4.11.6.  The third audit had been  conducted by a  superintendent in February 2018 . The audit  had 
scored the implementation of navigation and bridge resource management  aspects highly.  
However, t he audit had identified some areas where shipboard practices fell short of Maersk's 
expectations - namely lapses in logbook entries, the recording of navigation warnings and 
knowledge of the ship's EC DIS risk assessment.  T he audit had rated the Leda Maers k at 88% ,  
with a roo m-for-improvement score of 12%  - and it can be seen that the greatest shortfall in 
compliance was concerned with bridge team management, responsibility and authority.  The 
audit had been  conducted while the Leda Maersk  was operated by a different crew  from  the 
one involved in this accident .  
4.11.7.  A closer look at the February audit identifie d the areas where the auditor  had found that 
improvement was required.  These were:  the crew had not been aware of the vessel -specific 
ECDIS risk assessm ent; bridge watch handover checklists had been  pre-signed ; handover 
information had been  limited ; and officers had not been recording the at -berth under -keel 
clearance in the logbook.

4.11.8.  Areas where the Leda Maersk 's crew showed strong implementation of the company policy 
were : comprehensive passage planning with optimum ECDIS safety settings ; satisfactory 
position fixing ; knowledge of responsibility when navigating with a pilot on board ; and 
procedures for navigation in confined waters.  The audit findings were not consistent with 
what was observed in respect of this accident, in which  navigation, watchkeeping and bridge 
resource management  procedures were not carried out to the standard expected by Maersk.  
4.11.9.  The paper passage plan allowed a maximum distance o ff-track of 370 metres ( 0.2 cables ) in 
the channel , whereas the ECDIS off -track alarm was set at 556 metres ( 0.3 cables ).  When the 
ECDIS off -track al ert activated , no alarm  could be heard on the voyage data recorder  audio  - 
so it is about as likely as not  that the ECDIS audible alarms had been muted.  
4.11.10.  The ECDIS safety settings were not consistent with the settings recommended in Maersk's 
policy and guidance documents, nor were they optimised to give the bridge team the best

as the shallow pattern, indicates "non -navigable" water that is shallower  than the safety 
contour programmed into the ECDIS.  However, the settings were such that there were  no 
navigable areas of water shown on the ECDIS , despite the presence of the navigable dredged 
channel.   Figures 10 and 11 show how the ECDIS display can be optimised to give the bridge 
team a better understanding of the surrounding navigable and non -navigable waters.  
4.11.11.  Nothing in  the passage plan alerted the ship's bridge team  to the fact  that the beacons could 
be up to 4 6 metres outside the dredged channel , yet this information is available in the prime 
source s of information when planning a passage  to a New Zealand port - the ch art and 
'Admiralty Sailing Directions : New Zealand  Pilot'.  The master was under the false impression 
that the channel marker beacons were located at the edge of the dredged channel .  This 
added to his surprise that the ship had grounded when still inside the line of beacons.

4.11.12.  An audit provides  a snapshot of a ship's operating culture , and the previous crew  had scored 
well in the fields relating to safe navigating procedures when the ship was audited in February 
2018.  However, there were indicators then that not all policies and procedures were  being  
followed as intended by the operator.  This, in combination with the non -adherence to other 
aspects of the polic ies and procedures leading up to the grounding , is an indication that the 
procedural failures may not  have been confined to this one accident, and that the operator will 
need to review the standard of navigation under pilotage for all its crews to ensure that 
industry good practice is being achieved . 
The port operator  
Safety issue -  Port Otago's safety management system fell short of achieving good industry 
standard s for pilot training outlined in maritime rules, or fully achieving the principles of safety 
management systems outlined in the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety C ode. 
4.11.13.  The New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code is a voluntary arrangement between 
Maritime New Zealand, local government councils and port operators.  The code sets mutually  
agreed  national standard s for marine safety and pollution prevention within the ports and 
harbours of New Zealand.  Under the code, port operators, councils, harbourmasters, Maritime 
New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport work together to achieve th ose standards .  
4.11.14.  The code is b ased on the underlying principles of  safety  management systems, where policies 
and procedures result in hazards being identified and risk s being appropriately  managed.   
Safety management systems must result in full compliance with all maritime rules and ot her 
mandatory instruments .  However, maritime rules are generally regarded as minimum 
requirements.  A good safety management system should strive to meet good, if not best 
industry standards, which can be found in various industry guidelines.  The Port an d Harbour 
New Zealand Maritime School  

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report MO -2018 -203 Marine Safety Code contains such guidelines  for providers of maritime pilotage services.  
There are also several other internationally regarded guidelines30 that offer  similar advice . 
4.11.15.  In New Zealand, e ach port operator has a duty to safely operate , maintain and service the port 
and is accountable for the safety of  the port's marine operations.  
4.11.16.  Regional councils have a statutory function to ensure mari time safety within their region s.  The 
Maritime Transport Act 1994 states that regional c ouncils may regulate the ports, harbours , 
waters and maritime -related activities in their region s for the purpose of ensuring maritime 
safety.   A council can delegate some of the navigation safety functions and powers to council -
controlled organisations and port o perators.  
4.11.17.  A regional council may also appoint a harbourmaster to manage maritime safety in its region.  
Harbourmasters have functions, duties and operational powers to ensure maritime safety.   
Otago Harbour had not had a full -time harbourmaster for more th an 30 years.  
4.11.18.  Otago Regional Council and Port Otago  had been working together to meet the standards set 
in the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code.  However, at the time of the Leda Maersk 's 
grounding, Port Otago had not yet been considered as meet ing those  standards.  The 
harbourmaster  was new in the position and  Port Otago  was undergoing  operation al change 
following two recent accidents involving its pilots.  Policies, procedures and risk assessments 
were being updated . 
4.11.19.  Port Otago's pilot training programm e was outlined in its pilot training and proficiency plan, as 
required by Maritime Rules Part 90.  However, aspects of the plan, such as annual  
assessments  and pilot peer reviews , were not f ollowed .  For example, t he pilot on board the 
Leda Maersk had not been subject to an annual assessment  or peer review  since 2012.  
Additionally, the pilots were issued with the new  ChannelPilot PPUs , but were not given 
additional training in its use .  
4.11.20.  Within the space of two years, three of Port Otago's pilots had conduc ted pilotage on vessels 
that ran aground.  Port O tago had introduced the use of C hannel Pilot PPUs as a safety action, 
but had not at the time of this grounding  provided the pilots with in -depth training in their use.  
Port Otago relied on previous training  provided for the older HarbourPilot units .  Port Otago  
chose  to delay the ChannelPilot training until the pilots had some more personal experience 
with the new units.   There was no formal policy on the use of the PPUs , nor were  there any 
procedures for maintaining  and updating the PPUs . 
4.11.21.  PPUs can be useful aid s to navigation.  Their accuracy is well suited to monitoring the progress 
of large ships in narrow channels, and they provide a useful independent check of a ship's 
progress.  However, if pilots are t o use them, there should be a robust system for ensuring 
their accuracy and the pilots should be fully trained and proficient in their use.  
4.11.22.  As well as  having made  the changes in progress at the time of the grounding, Port Otago has 
taken a number of initia tives in response to the grounding, which are outlined in section 7 of 
this report.  A recommendation has been made to complete the change process to fully meet 
industry good practice.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The Leda Maersk  was negotiating a left -hand turn in the channel when it deviated from the 
intended track  and grounded , under the influence of : tide; helm ordered by the harbour pilot; 
and interaction between the ship's hull and the left bank of the channel . 
5.2. Neither the harbour pilot nor the ship's bridge team r ecognised that the Leda Maersk  was 
deviating from the planned track . This was  because they were not fully using the electronic 
navigation aids, all of which clearly showed the ship deviating from the centre of the channel . 
5.3. The entire bridge team was primar ily navigating 'by eye' .  Navigating a large ship in narrow 
channels, at night, using visual (line -of-sight) navigation only increases the  risk of the ship 
grounding  owing to  the bridge team losing situational awareness . 
5.4. The standard of bridge resource man agement on the bridge of  the Leda Maersk  fell short of 
industry good practice.  
5.5. The Leda Maersk  bridge team were not fully following the company policies and procedures 
for navigating in pilotage waters  
5.6. At the time of the grounding,  Port Otago's policies, procedures and compliance monitoring of 
pilotage operations fell short of achieving  industry standards for pilot training outlined in 
maritime rules , or fully achieving  the principles of  safety management systems  outlined in the  
New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code .

 7. Safety a ctions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  address ing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2.1.  Safety actions taken by Port Otago included the following:  
 completing an internal investigation report  
 requesting of cargo  planners  that containers not be stowed six  high in the outboard 
stacks directly forward of the bridge s of L-class ships31 
 allocating particular tasks and monitoring parameters to the bridge team during the 
master /pilot exchange  
 reinstating the annual assessments of the pilots  
 training in the  use of ChartPilot PPUs by the manufacturer, Navicom  Dynamics , was 
carried out in November 2018 . 
7.3. Safety actions taken by Maersk Line A/S included the following:  
 inserting a port memo for fleet vessels stating that , at Port Chalmers , "shallower depths 
have been reported in the channel and it is pruden t to navigate close to the middle of 
the channel.  Buoys have been place (sic) in shallower wat ers than is safe for 
navigation " 
 the next master was advised to complete a navigation audit and carry out a bridge 
discipline meeting for closing any existing ga ps in bridge procedures  
 the master, chief officer and second officer were to attend a Bridge Team Enhancement 
Programme prior to joining their next ship.  
 
 
  
                                                        
31 Subsequent to the accident, the L -class ships were rescheduled and no longer call at Port Otago.  The new 
service uses larger ships that do not have the same visibility problem.

 Final Report MO -2018 -203 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to Maersk Line A/S and Port Otago . 
8.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Reco mmendation to Maersk Line A/S  
8.2.1.  The bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk  fell short of achieving good industry practice 
in both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management.  
There were indicators from previous audits  that not all policies and procedures were being 
followed as intended by the operator.  This, in combination with the non -adherence to other 
aspects of the polic ies and procedures leading up to this grounding , is an indication that the 
procedural failures may not have been  confined to this one accident, and that the operator will 
need to review the standard of navigation under pilotage for all its crews to ensure that 
industry good practice is being followed . 
On 26 June 2019 , the Commission recommended to t he Chief Executive of Maersk Line A/S 
that they review the implementation of the company's safety management system across its 
fleet with respect to navigation and pilotage , and take the necessary steps to ensure a high 
standard is achieved by all crews on  all its ships .  (005/19)  
On 2 July 2019, Maersk Line A/S replied in part:  
1. Maersk Line has identified that training of ship staff is of utmost importance to 
ensure effective implementation of company procedures and for ensuring safety 
of navigation, includ ing navigation in pilotage waters.  In this regard following 
measures have been taken:  
 All navigators must undergo mandatory ECDIS training by Seagull A/S  
 Already commenced in 2019.  
 Aim is to enhance knowledge of navigators and to ensure optimum use of 
ECDIS as a tool.  
 This will be followed up by refresher training at two year intervals so that 
navigators remain up to date.  
 Further, all navigators are required to undergo Bridge Team Enhancement 
Programme Training.  
 The programme focusses on improved bridge  team work and optimum 
use of bridge resources.  
 In bridge simulator phase of this course navigating officers are put 
through scenarios which replicate navigation incidents that occur during 
coastal and pilotage waters.  
 As we employ over three thousand navigating officers, this process is 
being undertaken in a phased manner and will be completed in the year 
2025.  
2. Company procedures pertaining to navigation and use of ECDIS have been 
revised recently.  This has been done so that navigators find them easie r to 
understand, which in turn will increase adherence to these procedures.  Overview 
of revised SMS procedures is attached herewith.  
In accordance with the ISM code internal audit is carried out annually to verify 
compliance with the requirements of the S afety Management System. [These 
 
Final Report MO -2018 -203 
<< Page 29 >>
 include navigation audits by a superintendent.]  [The] last internal audit for Leda 
Maersk was conducted in Feb 2019.  
8.3. Recommendation to Port Otago  
8.3.1.  At the time of the grounding , Port Otago's policies, procedures and complian ce monitoring of 
pilotage operations fell short of meeting good industry standards for pilot training outlined in 
maritime rules, or fully achieving the principles of safety management systems  outlined in the 
New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code . 
 On 26 June 2019 , the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive Officer of Port Otago 
that they note where this report identifies areas where pilot age operations can be improved 
and continue taking  the necessary action s to ensure that pilotage operations fully meet good 
industry practice and the guidance provided in the New Zealand Port and Harbour  Marine  
Safety Code .  (006/19)     
On 25 September 2019, the Chief Executive of Port Otago replied:  
Port Otago , as a result of the learnings f rom the incident, delivered refresher training 
on PPU's to all pilots , completed in November 2018. Port Otago also instructed 
Maersk to change stowage plans to improve visibility on the L - Class vessels visiting 
Port Chalmers and Maersk complied in August 2018.  
For the record, the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code SMS review 
received on 23rd November 2017 identified some improvements to be undertaken 
by Port Otago and Otago Regional Council; all of Port Otago's actions were completed 
in early 2018. At the time of the incident, Port Otago was await ing the Otago 
Regional Council by-laws to be notified for public submission to close out the review. 
Port Otago's policies, procedures and compliance monitoring of pilotage operations 
at the time of the incident through 13th December 2018 were unchanged. Port 
Otago and the Otago Regiona l Council New Zealand received notification post 
another review that the SME was consistent with the requirements of the New 
Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code on 13th December 2018.

 Final Report MO -2018 -203 9. Key l essons  
9.1. The Commission repeats three key lessons made in a previous report32 
9.1.1.  There must be an absolute agreement and shared understanding between the vessel's bridge 
team and the pilot as to the passage plan and monitoring against that plan.  
9.1.2.  Vessels' bridge teams must actively promote and use the concept of bridg e resource 
management, including the incorporation of pilots into the bridge teams, to manage voyages 
properly.  
9.1.3.  A vessel's ECDIS is an important system for monitoring the progress of the vessel and warning 
the bridge team when things could go wrong.  It is  essential that it be configured correctly for 
the phase of navigation and the proximity to navigation hazards.  
9.2. The Commission identified one new key lesson  
9.2.1.  PPUs can be useful aids to navigation and their accuracy is well suited to allow ing pilots an 
indep endent means of monitoring the progress of large ships in narrow channels.  However, if 
pilots are to use them, the y should be fully trained and proficient in their use, and the re should 
be a robust system for ensuring the accuracy  of the equipment.
