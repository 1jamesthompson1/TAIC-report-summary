- name: Bridge Resource Management and Human Factors
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that involves the effective management of all the resources available to the bridge team, promoting good communication, teamwork, and the ability to respond to dangerous situations and emergencies. In the case of the Leda Maersk grounding, the standard of BRM "fell short of industry good practice" (5.4). The bridge team was not fully following company policies and procedures for navigating in pilotage waters (5.5), and there was a lack of effective teamwork, as evidenced by the bridge team's reliance on the pilot and their failure to actively monitor the ship's progress on electronic navigation equipment (4.6.2). This resulted in a single point of failure when the pilot lost situational awareness, leading to the grounding (4.7.2).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness is the understanding of what is happening in one's immediate environment and is critical for safe navigation. In the Leda Maersk incident, the bridge team and the pilot lost situational awareness, as they were navigating primarily by visual means and not fully utilizing electronic navigation aids, which would have shown the ship's deviation from the intended track (4.8.3, 4.8.4). The lack of situational awareness was a significant factor contributing to the grounding (5.2).
- name: Use of Electronic Navigation Aids
  explanation: The use of electronic navigation aids such as ECDIS and radar is essential for safe navigation, especially in narrow channels and during night operations. In the Leda Maersk grounding, the bridge team and pilot were not fully using these aids, which "clearly showed the ship deviating from the centre of the channel" (5.2). The ECDIS off-track alert was not communicated to the rest of the bridge team, which could have alerted them to the deviation and allowed for corrective action before the grounding (4.9.1).
- name: Compliance with Safety Management Systems
  explanation: Adherence to safety management systems (SMS) is crucial for ensuring safe ship operations. The Leda Maersk's bridge team did not fully comply with the company's SMS, particularly in monitoring the ship's position and movement and ensuring safe under-keel clearance (4.11.3). The grounding highlighted a failure to follow several policies of the SMS, indicating that procedural failures may not have been confined to this one accident (4.11.12).
- name: Pilotage and Training Standards
  explanation: Pilotage involves the use of maritime pilots to navigate ships through hazardous or congested waters. The Leda Maersk grounding revealed that Port Otago's safety management system "fell short of achieving industry standards for pilot training" (5.6). The pilot on board had not been subject to an annual assessment or peer review since 2012, and there was no formal policy or training for the use of PPUs (4.11.19, 4.11.20).
- name: Organisational Culture and Safety Culture
  explanation: Organisational culture and safety culture refer to the collective values, beliefs, and practices regarding safety within an organization. In the case of the Leda Maersk, there were indications that the ship's crew were not following the bridge and navigation aspects of the safety management system, and the port operator's safety management system had not been fully developed (4.10.1, 4.11.18). The grounding suggests that the safety culture may have been compromised, as evidenced by the lack of adherence to safety practices and procedures (4.11.12).
