  \ finds that the near -collision incident occurred  because  the train controller\
  \ did \nnot check the location of  the coal train and mistakenly a uthorised the\
  \ track engineer  to on-\ntrack his alicart and travel towards it on the same section\
  \ of track.   This was contrary to \nstandard protocol , which require d train controllers\
  \ to check all train movements before \ngranting track occupation authorisation\
  \ s4.  But for the train controller's action, the 2 rail \nvehicles would not have\
  \ been put into conflict.  \n4.1.2.  However, the train controller' s error  was\
  \ not hers alone .  Rather, a number of wider systemic  \nfactors  beyond the train\
  \ controller's  control  created an envi ronment  that increased the \nlikelihood\
  \ of her  making this error , namely : \n\uF0B7 a planned change to the train controller's\
  \ workload  was not assessed and managed in a \nway that recognised its higher -than\
  \ -usual level of risk  \n\uF0B7 the train control's workplace culture at the time\
  \ of the incident did not encourage train \ncontrollers to ask for help  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the train controller, who was performing a  safety -critical  function  with a\
  \ higher -than -usual \nlevel of risk , was able to become highly stressed and mentally\
  \ fatigued during her shi ft \nwithout anyone being aware of, or anticipating, this\
  \  \n\uF0B7 minimal training and education about detecting and managing stress and\
  \ fatigue was \nprovided to the train controller (and other train controllers) before\
  \ the incident , even \nthough she was performing a safety -critical  function.\
  \  Further, poor systems existed within \ntrain control at the time of the incident\
  \ to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the \nworkplace  \n\uF0B7 the train\
  \ controller received no support and minimal supervision  during her shift even\
  \  \nthough she was  performing a safety -critical  function with a higher -than\
  \ -usual level of risk  \n\uF0B7 train control protocols required train controllers\
  \ to work their shift s without scheduled \nbreaks  \n\uF0B7 poor  planning and\
  \ co-ordination of  track  infrastructure  activity  unnecessarily  exacerbat ed\
  \ \nthe complexity  of the train controller's work  on the day of the incident .\
  \  Train controllers \nwere responsible for co-ordinating and managing high volumes\
  \ of routine and unplanned \ntrack infrastructure activit ies.  This increase d\
  \ the complexity of their role.  In these \nsituations, mistakes could occur  \n\
  \uF0B7 a significant portion of the controlled rail network, and therefore a large\
  \ number  of trains \nand other rail vehicle s, were  not electronically visible\
  \ to tr ain control at any given ti me. \n4.1.3.  Each of these factors was a  safety\
  \ issue  - a condition within train control  that ha d the \npotential to create\
  \ an unacceptable outcome , such as  personal harm or loss and/or property \nand\
  \ environment damage.  All of these safety issues , collectively  contribut ed to\
  \ the train \ncontroller making the error.  \n  \n                             \
  \                           \n4  Rule 915(e) of  KiwiRail Rules and Operating Procedures\
  \ - Track  Occupancy Protection Rule . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report  11-102\
  \ 4.2. Risk management approach to assessing and managing a safety -critical  function\
  \  \nSafety issue:  A planned change to the train controller's workload  was not\
  \ assessed and \nmanaged in a way that recognised its higher -than -usual level\
  \ of risk . \n4.2.1.  The primary role of all train control personnel (particularly\
  \ train controllers)  is to prevent \ncollisions, organise and expedite the safe\
  \ movement  of rail traffic, and provide information \nand other support to all\
  \ rail t rack users.  They perform a  safety -critical  function  similar to  air\
  \ \ntraffic contro llers; that is,  a function on which  people depend for their\
  \ wellbeing.  Accordingly, \nif a train controller were to make a mistake, it could\
  \ result in loss of life and/or sign ificant \ndamage to property  and/ or the environment.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  If the normal procedure is to have one train controller working one\
  \ area, any change to this \narrangement (no matter how small) may create additional\
  \ risks  that KiwiRail  must properly  \nassess and manage . \n4.2.3.  In this case,\
  \ the merged desk arrangement  caused  a higher -than -usual level of risk  for\
  \ train \ncontrol because  it required one train controller to manag e one and a\
  \ half train control areas  \nduring a weekday (i.e. when rail traffic was typically\
  \ busy).  This larger area  included  the \nOtira/Rolleston section  (which form\
  \ ed part of the Midland Line).  The Otira/Rolleston section  \ntypically ha d a\
  \ high level of rail activity  and it  used a single -line automatic signalling\
  \  system , \nwhich  require d train controller s to issue running authorities \
  \ and to  record  manually  the \nlocation s of trains with the aid of  compulsory\
  \ radio calls  from  drivers confirming  their \nlocation s.  This system relie\
  \ d heavily on train controller s' memor ies and a high degree o f \nsituational\
  \ awareness (se e paragraph 4.8 for more details).  \n4.2.4.  Train control management\
  \ should have managed the risk of the train controller making an \nerror by : \n\
  \uF0B7 conduct ing a proper risk assessment of the merged desk  arrangement .  This\
  \ should have \ninvolve d their identifying and analysing the risks associated with\
  \ this arrangement , then \nputting in place  appropriate strategies to eliminate,\
  \ minimise and/or manage these risks  \n\uF0B7 properly assess ing whether the train\
  \ controller was the right person, with the right skills \nand expertise , to carry\
  \ out this activity  \n\uF0B7 regularly monitor ing the effectiveness of the ir\
  \ risk management strategies and the train \ncontroller's performance . \n4.2.5.\
  \  However, evidence reviewed by the Commission indicate d that no-one within train\
  \ control \nconducted a thorough analysis of the risks  associated with merging\
  \ the Otira/Rolleston \nsection  and the West Coast area during the day , including\
  \ the potential impact s of this \narrangement  on the train controller's workload.\
  \  Further more , no appropriate arrangements  \nwere  put in place to manage these\
  \ risks  or to ensure that the train controller was coping with \nher increased\
  \ responsibilities.  \n4.2.6.  KiwiRail submitted  that it did not consider a desk\
  \ merger  to be a significant change that \nwarranted a specific risk assessment\
  \ , but r ather  it was \"standard practice \".  KiwiRail  said:  \n\u2026 the daytime\
  \ merger of desks, while not as regular as it is at night, is not \"unusual\" at\
  \ all as it is \nstandard practice to accommodate events and other rostering  requirements\
  \ by combining desks \nand accepting that prioritisation by the train controller\
  \ will limit their responsiveness to lower \npriority requests.  \n4.2.7.  KiwiRail\
  \ also said:  \n\u2026 KiwiRail does not agree that there was \"a lack of proper\
  \ risk management approach\" as the \nmatter referred to was the decision to merge\
  \  desks, which  was made in accordance with a \nstandard practice, which  had not\
  \ generated any lead indicators of concern\u2026  \n\u2026 The [Commission's] inference\
  \ that a thorough risk analysis for the merging of the de sks is \nrequired appears\
  \ excessive\u2026  \n\u2026 we submit that the merging of an area was not considered\
  \ a \"significant change\" to warrant \nspecific risk assessment\u2026  \n  \nFinal\
  \ report  11-102 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2.8.  The Commission does not accept this view.\
  \  A merge d desk arrangement  might be standard \npractice for periods of low workload\
  \  (for example, at night for the Otira/Rolleston section) .  \nHowever,  the usual\
  \ arrangement  during the day was to have one train controller manage one  \ntrain\
  \ control area .  This was because of  the heavy w orkload that train cont rollers\
  \ were \nexpected to manage  on those sections during the day.  Accordingly, train\
  \ control management \nshould only have merged  these areas during the day after\
  \ considering  the increased risk s for \nthis safety -critical operation, and \
  \ then only after putting  in place appropriate measures to \nmitigate or control\
  \ those risks.  At the very least, the Network Control Manager (as the train \n\
  controller's direct manager ) should  have:  \n\uF0B7 checked the train controller\
  \ regularly  \n\uF0B7 stayed with the train controller long enough  to get a good\
  \ idea of her  workload and her \nability to cope  with her additional responsibilities\
  \  \n\uF0B7 taken the lead and directly asked the train controller how she was copin\
  \ g rather than \npassively stood  back waiting for the train controller to say\
  \ something  \n\uF0B7 ensured that the train contro ller was able to, and did, take\
  \  short breaks , i.e. at least l ong \nenough for her to stretch, get a drink and\
  \ something to eat , and go to the toilet.  \n4.2.9.  The Commission saw no evidence\
  \ that the Network Control Manager had done any of these \nthings .  He w as the\
  \ most senior person within train control, and was therefore  responsible for \n\
  ensuring that the train control function was properly managed.  This should have\
  \ include d \nensuring that an appro priate risk management approach was applied\
  \ whenever significant \nchanges occur red to the train control function , and when\
  \ such changes were  likely to affect its \nrisk profile, such as when a train control\
  \ area was to be  merged with another .  If this \nresponsibility had been  delegated\
  \ , the delegation should have been  properly documented, \nwith people's roles\
  \ and responsibilities clearly defined, and the appropriate processes put in \n\
  place to provide him with assurance that this delegation was being  properly performed.\
  \  \n4.2.10.  The Manager Network Operations said that he had not need ed to approve\
  \ the merger as he \nsaw this decision resting with the roster co-ordinator, who\
  \ he said was responsible for \norganising train controllers' workloads.  However,\
  \  the Manag er Network Operations ' position  \ndescription expressly required\
  \ him to identify risks withi n train control and appropriate \nmitigation strategies\
  \ , and to maintain an overview of train control's safety performance.  No \ndocuments\
  \ were made available to the Com mission showing that this responsibility had been\
  \ \ndelegated to the roster co-ordinator or to anyone else.  \n4.2.11.  Indeed,\
  \ KiwiRail confirmed that no position description existed for the roster co-ordinator\
  \ at \nthe time of the incident .  Rather, the co-ordination of  fortnightly rosters\
  \ within many parts of \nKiwiRail (not just train control) was performed by nominated\
  \ member s of particular teams \nrather than a dedicated person.  Medium - and short\
  \ -term changes to the train controller \nrosters , for example,  were undertaken\
  \  by 3 senior train controllers  at the time of the incident .  \nKiwiRail said\
  \ that this  arrangement  has since  changed with the establishment of a new roster\
  \ \nco-ordinator function .  KiwiRail said that this role is now  performed  by\
  \ a dedicated person \nrather tha n shared among senior train controllers , and\
  \ that this  safety action was taken  partly \nin response to this incident . \n\
  4.2.12.  KiwiRail also said that it was difficult for the roster co-ordinator  to\
  \ predict the train controller's \nworkload on the day , largely because of the\
  \ level s of unplanned track infrastructure activity  \nthat might arise.   There\
  \ was no evidence that the likely i mpact s of the merger  on the train \ncontroller's\
  \ work load had been properly assessed  by management . \n  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n\
  \ Final Report  11-102 4.2.13.  KiwiRail also said that the Manager Network Operations\
  \ and the Network Control Manager \nhad not been aware of the planned merger until\
  \ the day of the incident and, therefore, they \nhad been  unable to judge the potential\
  \ effect s of this merger on the train controller's \nworkload.   However, the roster\
  \ co-ordinator had emailed the Manager Network Operations \n(and sent a  copy to\
  \ the network control managers and train controllers) 6 days before the \nincident\
  \ (i.e. on 6 April 2011 ), confirming the arrangements for co-ordinating the special\
  \ \ntraining around  train control activities for the period from  8 April to 14\
  \ April.   Although the \nemail did not specifically say , \"The West Coast area\
  \ and the Otira/Rolleston section  will be \nmerged on 13 April 2011\", the arrangements\
  \ explained in  the email were in effect a merger of \nthe 2 areas.  \n4.2.14. \
  \ In its draft final report the Commission acknowledged  that the Manager Network\
  \ Operations \nand the Network Control Manager may not have realised from reading\
  \ this email or the roster \nthat the 2 train contro l desks  would be merged. \
  \ This prompted the Commission to ask the \nfollowing questions, to which KiwiRail\
  \ replied, as follows:  \n\uF0B7 were they  [the Manager Network Operations and\
  \ the Network Control Manager] concerned \nabout the merger when they did learn\
  \  about it on  the day of the incident ?  [KiwiRail reply:  \nAs previously discussed,\
  \ they would not have been ] \n\uF0B7 were they concerned that they had only just\
  \ become aware of it on the day of the \nincident?   [KiwiRail reply : No] \n\uF0B7\
  \ did they make enquiries to find out why they did not learn about it until the\
  \ day of the \nincident ?  [KiwiRail reply : No as it was a regular procedure ]\
  \ \n\uF0B7 did they make enquiries to assess the level of risk associated with the\
  \ merger upon \nbecoming aware of it?   [KiwiRail reply : No, as per above .] \n\
  4.2.15.  KiwiRail's answers were  consistent with  its view  that a merged desk\
  \ arrangement was not a \nsignificant change but rather standard practice .  However,\
  \ this view overlook ed one \nfundamental point ; namely  that train control is\
  \ a safety -critical  function .  In this case , the \nadditional risks should have\
  \ been considered.  \nFindings  \n1. Train control is a safety -critical  function\
  \ on which  people depend for their wellbeing.   A \nmistake by a train controller\
  \ could result in loss of life and/or significant damage to \nproperty and/ or the\
  \ environment.  \n2. Merging the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area\
  \ created a higher -than -\nusual level of risk for train control because it  resulted\
  \ in 2 normally busy lines having \nto be managed by one train controller . \n3.\
  \ KiwiRail did not properly assess  the implications  of merging the Otira/Rolleston\
  \ \nsection and the West Coast area during the daytime .  Accordingly,  it did not\
  \ recognise \nthe need for appropriate arrangements to be put in place to manage\
  \ the risks \nassociated with this merged desk arrangement . \n4. A merged desk\
  \ arrangement  during daytime  was a change to the normal roster  that \nshould\
  \ have been assessed.  Appropriate  measures should  also have been put in \nplace\
  \ to mitigate or control the risks  arising from this change . \n \n  \n  \nFinal\
  \ report  11-102 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3. Organisational  culture  \nSafety issue:\
  \  Train control's workplace culture at the time of the incident did not encourage\
  \ \ntrain controllers to  ask for help .  \n4.3.1.  The job description for network\
  \ control managers contained  little reference to supporting and \nmentoring train\
  \ controllers, and n one of the train control personnel interviewed said that they\
  \ \nhad received meaningful training  or mentoring  in how to manage workplace \
  \ stress, nutrition \nand fatigue.  \n4.3.2.  Comments from the train controller\
  \ and other train control personnel questioned by the \nCommission, as well as from\
  \ various organisation documents , suggest ed that a workplace \nculture existed\
  \ within train  control at the time of the incident that seemed to value those who\
  \ \noperated independently and required minimal supervision and/or intervention.\
  \  These \ncomments also indicated an unspoken understanding among train control\
  \ staff that train \ncontrollers were expected to sort out their own problems. \
  \ \n4.3.3.  To some extent, this was reinforced by the Network Control Manager ,\
  \ who said that he could \nnot recall a time when a train controller had asked for\
  \ help or had asked to be relieved from \ntheir duties because of a high workload.\
  \  It was also re inforced by the train controller , who \nsaid that she had received\
  \ unhelpful respons es in the past when seeking support from some \nnetwork control\
  \ managers.  She believed that she was expected to get on with her job and just\
  \ \ncope, no matter what.  To a large extent, this explains why the train controller\
  \ did not feel \ncomfortable asking for  help on the day of the incident.  \n4.3.4.\
  \  Other indicators of the organisational culture within train control at the time\
  \ of the incident \ncan be seen from the following discussion about stress and mental\
  \ fatigue, supervision and \nsupport and rest breaks.  \n4.4. Stress and  mental\
  \ fatigue  \nSafety issue:  The train controller, who was  performing a safety -critical\
  \  function  with a higher -\nthan -usual  level of  risk, was able to become highly\
  \ stressed and mentally fatigued during her \nshift without anyone being aware of,\
  \ or anticipating, this.  \n4.4.1.  The train controller's workload during her shift\
  \ can be seen from data recorded on the train \ncontrol voice recorder system  (see\
  \ Table 2 ).  This data  shows the  number and types of radio \ncalls to which \
  \ the train controller responded (hour by hour) during her 5-hour shift.  The 2\
  \ rows \nof sub -totals (in red) show the number of calls to which  2 train controllers\
  \ would have \nresponded if the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area\
  \ had not been merged.  \nTable 2: Calls handled by the train controller during\
  \ her shift  \nOtira/Rolleston section  0700 \nto \n0800  0800 to \n0900  0900 to\

  \ excluded from the Otira/Rolleston section  because the merged desk \narrangement\
  \ did not include this section.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report  11-102 4.4.2.\
  \  Table 2 shows that the train controller was consistently busy during her 5-hour\
  \  shift.  During \nher first 4 hours she received, on average, about 40 call s\
  \ per hour as opposed to the about 3 0 \ncalls per hour she would have received\
  \ if she had been working on the West Coast area alone .  \nHowever, during her\
  \ fifth and last hour (i.e. 1100 to 1200) the number of calls increase d to \n61.\
  \  It was during this time that the incident occurred ( 5 minutes before the end\
  \ of her shift).  \n4.4.3.  It was apparent  from the train control voice recorder\
  \ system that the train controller was \nstressed  and distressed during the last\
  \ hour of her shift .  For example, b etween  1130 and \n1150, the recording system\
  \  recorded episodes of the train controller swearing and sobbing  \n(off air).\
  \  She could  also be heard repeatedly sighing , and in one case she seemed to be\
  \ \nbegging for the work  to \"just stop\".  \n4.4.4.  At this time, the train controller\
  \ was  dealing with : \n\uF0B7 a greater  numb er of calls th an she had been dealing\
  \ with during each of the previous 4 \nhours of her shift  \n\uF0B7 a greater  number\
  \ of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily had to deal with .\
  \ \n4.4.5.  Other things were also happening to the train controller  at this time\
  \ , which may have \nexacerbated  her stress and fatigue levels and affected he\
  \ r ability to remain composed  and \nfully alert : \n\uF0B7 it is likely that the\
  \ train controller's glucose ( energy ) levels were significantly  low \nimmediately\
  \ before, and at the time  that, she made her error .  During her 5-hour  shift\
  \ the \ntrain controller felt she was unable to leave her desk to get something\
  \ to eat or drink, or to \ngo to the toilet .  By the time of the incident she had\
  \ not e aten anything for about 7 hours  \n(her most recent  meal was a light breakfast\
  \ at 0445 ).  The train controller admitted to \nbeing hungry towards the end of\
  \ her shift but said that the demands of working the  \nmerged desk meant  that\
  \ she could not leave her room .  KiwiRail submitted  that the train \ncontroller\
  \  could ha ve taken informal breaks in  accordance with \"normal practice \", noting\
  \ \nin particular that \"\u2026 [train control] has a practice of regular informal\
  \ breaks and \ninteractions, including food breaks for which a kitchenette facility\
  \ is provided\" .  However, \nthe fact that scheduled breaks were not included in\
  \ train controllers ' roster s meant that \nthe t rain controller in this case could\
  \ only take them as and when opportunit ies arose.  No \nsuch opportunit ies arose\
  \ during her 5 -hour shift  because of her high workload  \n\uF0B7 it is likely\
  \ that the train controller was mentally fatigued immediately before, and at the\
  \ \ntime that, she made her error .  By the n the  train controller had worked \
  \ 5 hours without a \nbreak  or food.  During this time she  had been  managing\
  \ a higher workload t han usual , \nwhich had required  her full concentration at\
  \ all times, with the need to  make split -second \ndecisions , often while under\
  \ pressure  \n\uF0B7 it is possible that the  train controller was momentarily distracted\
  \ by another  incident  at \nabout 1153  (2 minutes before the incident).  This\
  \ other incident involved  a track inspector  \nrepeatedly insist ing on accessing\
  \  a section of track that was congested with  train activity.  \nThe train controller\
  \ admitted to bei ng unsettled by a comment from this track in spector  \n(see the\
  \ following section on planning and co-ordinati ng track infrastructure activity\
  \ ). \n4.4.6.  Despite the train controller's growing stress  and fatigue during\
  \ the last hour of her shift, no -\none within train control seemed to be aware\
  \ of this .  Apart from 2 fleeting visits by the Network \nControl Manager at about\
  \ 0800 and 0900,  no-one else checked or monitored the train \ncontroller  during\
  \ her shift . \n4.4.7.  The Commission finds  it alarming that a  person performing\
  \ a safety -critical  function  with a \nhigher -than-usual level of risk  was able\
  \ to  become  highly  stressed and mentally fatigued \nwithout anyone being aware\
  \  of, or anticipating , this. \n  \n  \nFinal report  11-102 \n<< Page 17 >>\n\
  \ Training and education  \nSafety issue:  Minimal training and education about\
  \ detecting and managing stress and \nfatigue was provided to the train controller\
  \ (and other train controllers) before the incident , \neven though she was performing\
  \ a safety -critical  function.  Further, poor systems existed  \nwithin train control\
  \ at the time of the incident to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the \n\
  workplace.  \n4.4.8.  Train control personnel questioned by the Commission said\
  \ that they had received little \ntraining and education to help them manage stress\
  \ and fatigu e effectively , or to help them \nidentify others who might be experiencing\
  \ these things.  Although there appeared to be a \nstrong focus on procedural accuracy\
  \ within train control, and an active assessment \nprogramme to monitor train controllers'\
  \ technical per formance, there was little evidence of an \nequal emphasis on train\
  \ controllers' physical and emotional wellbeing.  \n4.4.9.  This is  surprising\
  \ given the mentally challenging nature of train control and the pressure that \n\
  comes with performing a safety -critical  functio n.  Train controllers are expected\
  \ to make \nnumerous split -second decisions on a daily basis, and to get these\
  \ decisions right at all times.  \nA momentary lapse of concentration could result\
  \ in loss of life.  For most people, this type of \nresponsibility woul d be hugely\
  \ stressful.  \n4.4.10.  It is difficult to say with certainty if and to what extent\
  \ the train controller would have better \nmanaged her stress at the time of the\
  \ incident if she had received proper training and \neducation in these areas beforehand.\
  \  The effec ts of stress and pressure on individuals and \ntheir performance var\
  \ y widely depending on factors such as age, work experience, personality \ntraits,\
  \ physical and mental health and attitude.  However, proper training and education\
  \ about \nstress and fatigue for people performing safety -critical  functions should\
  \ be mandatory, and \ntrain control should have appropriate systems and protocols\
  \ in place to monitor and manage \ntrain controllers' stress and fatigue levels.\
  \  \nSafety actions  \n4.4.11.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission\
  \ of 2 safety actions that it had \nimplemented:  \n\uF0B7 an alertness management\
  \ training programme for train controllers before starting on -the-\njob training,\
  \ with \"refresher training\" provided biennially after that  \n\uF0B7 compulsory\
  \ medical assessments for train controllers, including mental and physical \nchecks.\
  \  \n4.4.12.  On 2 July 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of a new managerial\
  \ role (the train control \nmanager), which had been  created in July 2011 partly\
  \ in response to the Commission's inquiry \ninto this incident .  The Commission\
  \ unders tands that this  new role is specifically responsible \nfor developing\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 a staff support programme, which covers stress , fatigue management\
  \ and staff well being  \n\uF0B7 train controllers' supervisory competencies.  \n\
  4.4.13.  These steps are positiv e; however, it is still unclear to the Commission\
  \ if appropriate systems \nhave been established to detect and manage stress within\
  \ train control.  If not, these are gaps \nthat should be addressed.  \n  \n\n<<\
  \ Page 18 >>\n Final Report  11-102 Findings  \n5. During the train controller's\
  \  last hour  of her shift she  dealt  with a greater  number of \ncalls than she\
  \ had  dealt with during each of the  previous  4 hours of her shift, and she \n\
  dealt with a greater  number of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily\
  \ \nhad to deal with.  \n6. The train controller was stressed,  mentally fatigued\
  \ and operating well below an \noptimal level when she made her error.  \n7. No-one\
  \ within train control was aware of the train controller's growing stress and \n\
  mental fatigue , even though she was performing a safety -critical  function  with\
  \ a \nhigher -than -usual level of risk . \n8. Proper training about managing stress\
  \ and fatigue was not available to train control \npersonnel before or at the time\
  \ of the incident.  \n9. No proper systems existed at the time of the incident to\
  \ detect and manage stress \nand fatigue in the workplace.  \n10. KiwiRail has implemented\
  \ a number of safety actions address ing some a spects of the \nsafety issues  relevant\
  \ to poor stress and fatigue management . \n4.5. Supervision and support  \nSafety\
  \ issue:  The train controller received insufficient support and supervision  during\
  \ her shift \neven though she was performing a safety -critical  function with a\
  \ higher -than -usual  level of \nrisk. \n4.5.1.  Despite the high demands of working\
  \ a merged desk  and the higher -than -usual  level of risk \nassociated with this\
  \ arrangement, the train controller received  insufficient support and \nsupervision\
  \ during her 5-hour  shift.  \n4.5.2.  The physical layout of train control meant\
  \ that her manager, the Network Control Manager , \ncould no t see or hear the train\
  \ controller from his desk.  Accordingly, in order to monitor her, \nhe needed to\
  \ walk to the  train controller's room at the end of a corridor.  Further,  in order\
  \ to \nget an accurate idea of the level of activity with which  the train con troller\
  \ was dealing at any \nparticular time, the Network Control Manager needed to go\
  \ into her room and view the train \ncontroller's computer screens and train control\
  \ diagram , and listen to her radio calls.  This \ncould not be done  from his desk\
  \ or from anywhere else within train control  (see the layout of \ntrain control\
  \ in Figure s 2 and 3 , particularly the location of the Network Control Manager's\
  \ \ndesk in relation to the train controller's room ). \n4.5.3.  The Network Control\
  \ Manager said that his usual appro ach for supervising train controllers \nwas\
  \ to peer into each train controller 's cubicle to get an idea of the level of activity\
  \ that each \nperson was managing and to ensure that trains were running smoothly\
  \ and without incident.  \nHe said that s ometimes his  visits would be  fleeting\
  \ to avoid distracting the train controllers , \nwhereas at other times he would\
  \ spend longer with each train controller.  In many cases , he \nsaid, his approach\
  \  at the time  would depend  on what was happening with each train controller \n\
  and his own work priorities.  \n4.5.4.  The Network Control Manager said that on\
  \ the day of the incident he put his head into the \ntrain controller's cubicl e\
  \ at about 0800 and 0900.  B oth visits were fleeting.  The train  control \nvoice\
  \ recorder system  showed  that the train controller was busy but composed  at these\
  \  times.  \nAccordingly,  there was nothing for the Network Control Manage r to\
  \ be concern ed about  at \nthese times , in terms of  both  the train controller's\
  \ performance and the level of activity with \nwhich  she w as dealing .  The Network\
  \ Control Manager did not check the train controller again \nduring her shift .\
  \ \n  \nFinal report  11-102 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.5.5.  The Network Control Manager\
  \ said that during his 10 years in the role he had never closed a \ntrain control\
  \ desk or arranged relief for a train controller.  H e also said that if he saw\
  \ a train \ncontroller struggling with high work demands , his usual approach would\
  \ be to suggest  that \nthey take a break.  If this had occurred in this case, then\
  \ a t the very least the train controller \nwould  have had time  to rest and get\
  \ something to eat  and drink.  H owever, neither opportunity \nwas available to\
  \ her because the Network Control Manager largely left the train controller \nalone\
  \ during her shift.  Accordingly, he remained unaware of the train controller's\
  \  needs and \nher incre asing ly stressed  state during the last hour of her shift.\
  \  \n4.5.6.  The Network Control Manager also said that he expected train controllers\
  \ to tell him if there \nwas a problem , and to ask for help.  The Manager Network\
  \ Operations also said  this, saying \nthat if the train controller had had concerns\
  \ about her workload she should have said so  \neither before or during her shift\
  \ .  The train controller, however, said that she did not feel \ncomfortable doing\
  \ this, partly because she believed that the ros ter was final and, therefore, \n\
  not subject to discussion, and partly because she thought  that her concerns might\
  \ not be \nacted on .  Accordingly, she remained silent.  \n4.5.7.  The Commission\
  \ accepts that people must  take responsibility for their own  wellbeing and that\
  \ \nthey cannot abdicate this responsibility entirely to their managers .  Accordingly,\
  \ the  train \ncontroller  could  have told the  Network Control Manager that she\
  \ was anxious about her shift \nas soon as she became aware of it , and she could\
  \ have asked for help  during her shift when  \nher workload was high .  In both\
  \ cases, however, she chose not to (at least deliberately  in the \nfirst case and\
  \ more likely  without thinking in the second  case  because she was too busy ).\
  \ \n4.5.8.  However,  an employer has a responsibility to fost er a workplace culture\
  \ that enables its \nemployees to feel comfortable about speaking up and asking\
  \ for help without fear of ridic ule \nor reprimand, particularly if that employer\
  \ is in the business of performing a safety -critical  \nfunction.  Comments from\
  \ the  train controller and other train control personnel whom  the \nCommission\
  \ questioned  suggest ed that there may have been an unspoken understanding \nwithin\
  \ train control at the time of the incident that train control perso nnel were expected\
  \ to get \non with their  jobs and sort out their own problems.  \nFindings  \n\
  11. The train controller received no support and minimal supervision during her\
  \ 5-hour  \nshift, despite the high demands of working a merged desk and the higher\
  \ -than -usual  \nlevel of risk associated with this arr angement.  \n12. The lack\
  \ of proper supervision meant that no -one within train control was aware of the\
  \ \ntrain controller's workload and her increasing ly stressed state in the last\
  \ hour of her \nshift.  \n4.6. Rest breaks  \nSafety issue:  Train control protocols\
  \ required train controllers to work their shift s without any \ncertainty of reasonable\
  \ breaks.  \n4.6.1.  Previous discussions in this report have talked about how the\
  \ train controller's high workload \nmeant that she was unable to have a break,\
  \ get something to eat and drink and go to the \ntoilet during her 5 -hour shift.\
  \  This discussion needs to be placed in context.  \n  \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final\
  \ Report  11-102 4.6.2.  KiwiRail told the Commission that a  standard train controller\
  \ shift was 8 hours  Monday to \nFriday, although in this case  the train controller\
  \ was required to work a 5-hour shift so that she \ncould attend a training session\
  \ at the end of her shift.  Some weekend shifts were rostered for \n12 hours.  KiwiRail\
  \ also told the Commission  that standard protocol within train control was \nnot\
  \ to provide train controllers with sche duled breaks within their shifts because\
  \ of the need \nfor them to be near their desks at all times to hear and respond\
  \ to calls.  In particular KiwiRail  \nsaid:  \nTrain control required train controllers\
  \ to work their shift without scheduled breaks: but has a \npractice of regular\
  \ informal breaks and interactions including food breaks for which a kitchenette\
  \ \nis provided.  \n4.6.3.  This meant that meal, toilet and rest breaks  were to\
  \ be taken as and when opportunit ies \narose, essentially during quiet period s.\
  \  In many cases then, train controllers would eat at their \ndesks and have rest\
  \ and toilet breaks as and when their workloads allowed them to.  \n4.6.4.  KiwiRail\
  \ also told the Commission that train controllers preferred this approach, which\
  \ had \nbeen confirmed through their collectiv e employment bargaining negotiations.\
  \  Indeed, at least \n2 train controllers with whom  the Commission spoke said that\
  \ they did not mind working their \nshifts without scheduled breaks.  In addition,\
  \ the Commission made enquiries of the Accident \nInvestigation Board in Norway\
  \ and Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited5.  Both \norganisations confirmed\
  \ a similar arrangement where train controller shifts were 8 hours, \nwithout scheduled\
  \ breaks.  \n4.6.5.  Notwithstanding this, there are obvious risks with people who\
  \ perform safety -critical  functions \nworking long hours without any certainly\
  \ of reasonable breaks, particularly if the work required \nis complex and mentally\
  \ demanding , such as train control.  The fact that someone else may be \ndoing\
  \ the same thing or that employees a nd their union may like what is being done\
  \ is not a \ngood reason for continuing an arrangement involving a safety -critical\
  \  function  that may give \nrise to significant risks, particularly if these risks\
  \ are not properly identified and managed.  \nThere is a wea lth of cases in which\
  \ long and irregular working hours have contributed to  \npeople making errors and\
  \ that have been associated with a range of physical and mental \nhealth and injury\
  \ risks (International Labour O rganisation , 2011).  Five hours (and certainly\
  \ 8 \nor 12  hours) without any certainty of a reasonable break is a long time to\
  \ expect a person to \nremain fully alert and in peak mental form.  \n4.6.6.  Further,\
  \ KiwiRail's policy that rest breaks should be taken as and when opportunit ies\
  \ arise \nfails to take account of  the \"overworked or extremely busy train controller\
  \ \"; that is, the train \ncontroller whose workload is so high that they are  unable\
  \ to leave their desk.  This was the \ncase here.  The fact that the train controller\
  \ could not leave her room to get something t o eat \nand drink or to go to the\
  \ toilet during her 5 -hour shift because of her workload was \nunacceptable.  Not\
  \ only was this unsafe for the train controller because of the potential \neffect\
  \ s on her mental and physical wellbeing , it was also potentially unsafe for those\
  \ relying on \nher to perform her safety -critical  function without error.  \n\
  4.6.7.  As a rough comparison, the Commission asked Airways New Zealand to confirm\
  \ the breaks \nprovided to air traffic controllers.  Air traffic controll ers with\
  \ radar duties had break s every 2 \nhours, air traffic control planners every 2.5\
  \ hours and international air traffic controllers every \n3 hours.  The general\
  \ rationale for these breaks was largely to minimise the effects of fatigue \n(e.g.\
  \ mental fatigu e and eye fatigue for those looking at radar screens for long periods\
  \ of \ntime).  \n4.6.8.  The Commission does not accept that KiwiRail's approach\
  \ to rest breaks , where its train \ncontrollers work 8 - or 12 -hour shift s without\
  \ certainty of reasonable breaks, is safe - certainly  \nnot without proper processes\
  \ in place to manage and mitigate  properly  the risks of this \napproach , such\
  \ as fatigue and stress.  This is a significant safety issue that must be properly\
  \ \nassessed and managed.  \n                                                  \
  \      \n5  Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited is responsible  for the management\
  \ of more than  8500 route kilometres of standard -\ngauge interstate track in South\
  \ Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.  It also\
  \ manages the \nHunter Valley coal rail network, and other regional rail links,\
  \ in New South Wales.  \n  \nFinal report  11-102 \n<< Page 21 >>\n Findings  \n\
  13. Train control protocols req uired train controllers to work their shift s without\
  \ \nscheduled breaks.  Meal, toilet and rest breaks were to be taken as and when\
  \ \nworkloads permitted . \n14. The train controller believed that she could not\
  \ leave her room during her 5 -hour \nshift because of her high workload.  Accordingly,\
  \ she did not  have a rest, get \nsomething to eat or drink or go to the toilet\
  \ during her shift.  Not only was this unsafe \nfor the train controller because\
  \ of the pote ntial effect s on her mental and physical \nwellbeing , it was also\
  \ unsafe for those relying on her judgement.  \n15. KiwiRail's approach to rest\
  \ breaks, where its train controllers work 8 -hour shift s \nwithout any certainty\
  \ of breaks, is not safe - certainly not w ithout proper processes \nin place to\
  \ manage and mitigate  properly  the risks of this approach such as fatigue \nand\
  \ stress.  This is a significant safety issue that must be properly assessed and\
  \ \nmanaged.  \n4.7. Planning  and co-ordination of track infrastructure activity\
  \  \nSafety issue s: Poor planning and co-ordination of track infrastructure activit\
  \ ies unnecessarily  \nexacerbated the complexity of the train controller's work\
  \ on the day of the incident.  Train \ncontrollers are responsible for co-ordinating\
  \ and managing high volumes of routine and \nunplanned track infrastructure activit\
  \ ies.  This increase s the complexity of their role.  In these \nsituations, mistakes\
  \ c an occur . \n4.7.1.  Train control personnel questioned by the Commission said\
  \ that about  50% t o 80% of their  \ncalls on a typical weekday could  involve\
  \  routine repair, maintenance and inspection activit ies.  \nMost  of these, they\
  \ said, could also be unplanned ; that is, infrastructure personnel  calling \n\
  train control \"out of the blue \" asking to occupy section s of rail track at any\
  \ given time.  Often, \nthey said, track staff could be insistent , thereby putting\
  \ pressure on train controllers to issue \nthem with track occupation authorisations\
  \ . \n4.7.2.  On the day of the incident  the train control vo ice recording showed\
  \ that the train controller  \nhandled  79 calls from infrastructure personnel \
  \ requesting track occupation s for routine track \nmaintenance and inspection tasks\
  \  in the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area.  \nNone of these requests\
  \ ha d been pre -planned with train control  except for the trip involving  \nthe\
  \ track engineer.  In addition, the train controller  handled  6 calls from the\
  \ West Coast area \nfor routine on -track maintenance and inspection activities.\
  \   That made 85 calls for routine \nwork  (out of a total of 224 calls) , which\
  \ were for unplanned work . \n4.7.3.  Rathe r than declining those calls, there\
  \ by taking some pressure off her self, the train controller \ndealt with all of\
  \ them as and when they came in.  This was  standard practice within train \ncontrol.\
  \  The train controller believed that this was expected of her and other train controllers.\
  \  \n4.7.4.  By extrapolating the figure of 85 calls (taking into account a shortened\
  \ 5 -hour shift instead of \nthe usual 8 -hour shift), the  Commission roughly estimates\
  \  that in excess of 500 calls for \nroutine and unplanned track occupations could\
  \ be made across all 10 train control desks on \nany given weekday.  If even remotely\
  \ accurate, this number is significant . \n4.7.5.  KiwiRail submitted  that train\
  \ controllers could decline track occupation authorisations during \nbusy work periods.\
  \  However, it was unclear to the Commission how a train controller was \nexpected\
  \ to exercise this authority.  Train controllers are not fully trained in schedulin\
  \ g and \nprioritising infrastructure repair s and maintenance .  They are not \
  \ privy to decisions and \ninformation about which  repair and maintenance tasks\
  \  are high priorities and which  are not .  \nAccordingly, even though they may\
  \ have the authority to decline tra ck occupations,  train \ncontroller s are unlikely\
  \ to know if their  decision s will affect  the safety and efficiency of the \n\
  railway infrastructure that is to be in spected, repaired and maintained.  \n\n\
  << Page 22 >>\n Final Report  11-102 4.7.6.  KiwiRail also submitted  that a core\
  \ requirement of any train controller was to prioritise their \nworkload issues\
  \ irrespective of whether desk s were merged or not.  KiwiRail said : \nIn all railways,\
  \ and most infrastructures for that matter, the management of the interface \nbetween\
  \ in frastructure maintenance and real time operations is an inherent function that\
  \ \nrequires command and control.  It is not valid to conclude that this 'places\
  \ unreasonable \npressure' on the controller.  \n4.7.7.  The Commission accepts\
  \ that a core function of train contr ol is to manage the interface \nbetween infrastructure\
  \ maintenance and real -time train operations.  It also accepts that every \nperson,\
  \ no matter what organisation they are with and no matter what role they perform,\
  \ must \nprioritise their work demands.  Howeve r, KiwiRail's comments miss a fundamental\
  \ point  - that \ntrain controllers perform the safety -critical  role of managing\
  \ the safe movement of rail traffic \nacross the entire national rail network. \
  \  It is concerning then that they are also  expected  to co-\nordina te and manage\
  \ a high volume of routine and unplanned track infrastructure activit ies on \n\
  an ad -hoc basis .  The more of this work that is pre -planned by KiwiRail's  Infrastructure\
  \ and \nEngineering team, the easier it will be for the train controllers to manage\
  \  the interface \nbetween infrastructure maintenance and real -time operations.\
  \  \n4.7.8.  In terms of this incident,  the train controller's workload  on the\
  \ day of the incident would  have \nbeen less demanding if : \n\uF0B7 proper processes\
  \ had been in place  at the time of the incident  to better co -ordinate and \n\
  manage track infrastructure activity  to ensure , for example, that the train controller\
  \ only \nreceived track occupation requests for  priority,  planned tasks only \n\
  \uF0B7 the train controller had known  that she had the ability  to decline track\
  \ occupation \nrequests for routine  maintenance tasks . \n4.7.9.  Whether or not\
  \ this would have been enough to prevent the train controller  making the error\
  \ is \nunknown ; however, at the very least it would  have decreased the likelihood\
  \ of her doing so . \n4.7.10.  Finally, the train controller referred to a sarcastic\
  \ comment made by a track inspector shortly  \nbefore the incident, which unsettled\
  \ her.   Given the critical and complex role that train \ncontrollers perform, \
  \ it is important  that people who contact  train control conduct themselves \n\
  in a way that does not distract train controller s.  KiwiRail  has operating protocols\
  \ for \ncommunications to train control and standard radio phraseology6, which require\
  \ \ncommunications t o be clear, concise and focused .  Casual conversation , superfluous\
  \ \ninformation and unnecessary comments are not permitted .  It is important that\
  \  KiwiRail has \nproper  protocols  in place to monitor people's compliance with\
  \ these protocols . \nSafety action s \n4.7.11.  During the course of this inquiry\
  \ KiwiRail created a new position within  its infrastructure and \nengineering division\
  \  with responsibility for developing and implementing a system to integrate  \n\
  track occupations better with the  running of trains.  This is a p ositive step,\
  \ particularly if the \nnew system is operational  and track infrastructure activity\
  \  is better co -ordinated and \nmanaged.  The Commission would welcome  comment\
  \ from KiwiRail on the status and \neffectiveness of this safety action, particularly\
  \ in terms of whether or not it has reduced , or is \nreducing,  the number  of\
  \ calls  to train controllers for unpredicted track occupation \nauthorisations.\
  \  \n  \n                                                        \n6  Rail Oper\
  \ ating Rules and Procedures: Section 12: Radio Communications. Ontrack,  30 June\
  \ 2008.  \n  \nFinal report  11-102 \n<< Page 23 >>\n 4.7.12.  On 22 March 2013\
  \ KiwiRail informed the Commission that it was in the early stages of moving \n\
  the fortnightly co-ordination of train control rosters to a single non -train -controller\
  \ co-ordinator.  \nThis person will use a dedicated computerised application that\
  \ will provide improved \nmonitoring and reporting of all roster arrang ements.\
  \  This safety ac tion is also positive, \nprovided that this person's role and\
  \ responsibilities are well defined , and proper processes \nare in place to require\
  \ them  (or who mever the appropriate person is) to assess properly (from \na risk\
  \ management persp ective) the impact s of any changes on train controllers' workload\
  \  and \non train control generally.  \n4.7.13.  On 27 March 2013 KiwiRail informed\
  \ the Commission about Train Control Instruction A028 \n(dated 11 October 2012)\
  \ entitled Train Control ler Workload Management .  This instruction \nconfirm ed\
  \ (among other things) that train controllers could  decline requests, prioritise\
  \ calls \nand not respond to low -priority calls or tasks if they were  dealing\
  \ with higher -than -usual  \nworkloads.  This safety action is promising ; howev\
  \ er, Instruction A028 does not make it clear \nhow train  controllers are expected\
  \ to know which  routine track infrastructure activit ies to \nprioritise or decline\
  \ without proper guidelines and scheduling plans available to them.   For \nexample,\
  \ given that train c ontrollers are not fully trained in scheduling or in infrastructure\
  \ \nrepair and maintenance, and given that they are not privy to decisions and information\
  \ about \nwhich  activit ies are  high priority or not, how are they expected to\
  \ prioritise routine \nmaintena nce or inspections  properly under Instruction A028?\
  \  \n4.7.14.  On 2 July 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of a national business\
  \ improvement project \nthat it  had initiated in 2010 to move the prioritisation\
  \ , planning and scheduling of \ninfrastructure activity to a n electronic system\
  \ called a n IBM Maximo platform.  KiwiRail \nconfirm ed that the roll -out of this\
  \ system had begun in June 2013 following a series of pilots, \nwhich showed that\
  \ unplanned track infrastructure activities could be reduced to less than half \n\
  their former level s. \n4.7.15.  KiwiRail also noted the introduction of a series\
  \ of measures to improve safety and pro ductivity \nby reducing the amount of work\
  \ undertaken where trains and track infrastructure activit ies \noccur.  The first\
  \ trial s of these measures were comm enced on the East Coast Main Trunk \nduring\
  \  early 2013 , with a further trial on the Midland and Stillwater/Ngakawau  Lines\
  \ during  \nJuly 2013.  \nFindings  \n16. The t rain controller had to deal with\
  \ a high volume of routine and unplanned track \ninfrastructure activit ies during\
  \ her shift.  The poor planning and co-ordination of \nthese activit ies unnecessarily\
  \ exacerbated the complexity of her work.  \n17. Train controllers , generally,\
  \  have to deal with a high volume of rout ine and \nunplanned track infrastructure\
  \ activit ies in addition to managing the flow of rail \ntraffic .  This increase\
  \ s the complexity of their role by requiring them to manage and \nco-ordinate \
  \ large volumes of unknown and unplanned work.   In these \ncircumstances, mistakes\
  \ can occur.  \n18. KiwiRail has implemente d a number of safety actions to address\
  \ the risks \nassociated with train controllers co -ordinating and managing the\
  \ interface between \ninfrastructure activities and rail movements.  \n  \n\n<<\
  \ Page 24 >>\n Final Report  11-102 4.8. Knowing where rail vehicles are on the\
  \ rail network  \nSafety issue:  A large number  of rail movements and track activities\
  \ are not electronically \nvisible to train control at any given time.  \n4.8.1.\
  \  In New Zealand, about 40% of the controlled network is configured with one of\
  \ 4 types of \nautomatic signalling system .  Trains operating within automatic\
  \ signalling systems are for the \nmost part  displayed  on train controllers '\
  \ mimic screen s.  The other 60% of the controlled \nnetwork is track warrant control\
  \ territory , colloquially referred to as \"dark territory \".  Trains \noperating\
  \ in track warrant control territory are not electronically visible to train controllers.\
  \  \nOther rail vehicles such as hi-rail vehicles are not electronically visible\
  \ to train controllers \nanywhere on the controlled network.  \n4.8.2.  The Midland\
  \ Line, which includes the Otira/Rolleston section, is also the only line in New\
  \ \nZealand that operates single -line automatic signalling , one of the 4 types\
  \ of automatic \nsignalling .  Along  this line  are 15 crossing stations .  As\
  \ a train pass es through 4 of these \nstations, signal s are triggered and relayed\
  \  back to train control .  These signal s appear  on a \nmimic screen  that the\
  \ train controller can see, thereby telling the train controller which \ncrossing\
  \ station s the train has passed.  Apart from when a train passes one of these 4\
  \ \nstations, the train is not  electronically visible to train control.  \n4.8.3.\
  \  Accordingly, a train controller will only know the approximate location of a\
  \ train on the Midland  \nLine by  relying on : their paper -based train control\
  \ diagram ; the issue of running authorities ; \nand compulsory radio calls from\
  \ train drivers.   This system relie s heavily on train controller s \nhaving  a\
  \ high degree of situational awareness and excellent memor ies.  It also relies\
  \ on train \ncontroller s accurately recording  trains ' progress on train control\
  \ diagram s, and  on train drivers \nand other track users complying with the terms\
  \ of their running authorities and track \noccupations . \n4.8.4.  A train controller's\
  \ job would be easier, and public safety would be i mproved, if all trains and \n\
  hi-rail vehicles on the controlled rail network were electronically visible to them\
  \ at all times.  \nSince this incident , KiwiRail has developed a system that shows\
  \ train controllers the location s \nof all trains over 95% of its cont rolled network\
  \ with a reasonable level of accuracy.  The \nsystem, known as \"GeVIS \", uses\
  \ global positioning system technology.  A project to provide \nvisibility for hi\
  \ -rail vehicles through the same system is nearing completion.  \n4.8.5.  If the\
  \ train controller in this case had had access to the GeVIS system and could  have\
  \ seen , at \na glance, all train movements along the Otira/Rolleston section  in\
  \ real time, and if she had \nglanced at the screen before issuing the track occupation\
  \ authorisat ion to the track engineer, \nshe would have seen that the loaded coal\
  \ train had not yet passed Staircase.  \nFinding s \n19. Single -line automatic\
  \ signalling, by itself, did not directly contribute to the incident.  \nRather,\
  \ it was more a factor that increased the complexity of the train controller's \n\
  job on the day of the incident.  Given this, the signalling system should have been\
  \ \nproperly examined as part of a wider risk assessment of the merger.  \n20. A\
  \ train controller's job would be easier, and public safety would be improved, if\
  \ all \ntrains and hi -rail vehicles on the controlled rail network were electronically\
  \ visible \nto train control at all times.  That way, they could see at a glance\
  \ all rail vehic le \nmovements on a particular track at any given time.   Since\
  \ this incident, KiwiRail \nhas introduced a system that makes all trains on 95%\
  \ of its controlled network \nelectronically visible to train controllers.  \n \

  \ damage to property  and/ or \nthe environment.  \n5.2. Merging the Otira/Rolleston\
  \ section  and the West Coast area created a higher -than -usual  level \nof risk\
  \ for train control  because it  resulted in 2 normally busy lines having to be\
  \ managed by \none train controller . \n5.3. KiwiRail did not properly assess the\
  \ implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section and \nthe West Coast area\
  \ during the daytime .  Accordingly, it did not recognise the nee d for \nappropriate\
  \ arrangements to be put in place to manage the risks associated with this merged\
  \ \ndesk arrangement.  \n5.4. A merged desk arrangement during daytime  was a change\
  \ to the normal roster  that should \nhave been assessed.  Appropriate measures\
  \ should also  have been put in place to mitigate or \ncontrol the risks arising\
  \ from this change.  \nStress and mental fatigue  \n5.5. During the train controller's\
  \ last hour of her shift she dealt with a greater  number of calls than \nshe had\
  \ dealt with during each of the previous 4  hours of her shift, and she dealt with\
  \ a \ngreater  number of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily\
  \ had to deal with.  \n5.6. The train controller was stressed, mentally fatigued\
  \ and operating well below an optimal level \nwhen she made her error.  \n5.7. No-one\
  \ within train control was aware of the train controller's growing stress and mental\
  \ \nfatigue , even though she was performing a safety -critical  function with a\
  \ higher -than -usual  \nlevel of risk.  \n5.8. Proper training about managing stress\
  \ and fatigue was not ava ilable to train control personnel \nbefore or at the time\
  \ of the incident.  \n5.9. No proper systems existed at the time of the incident\
  \ to detect and manage stress and fatigue \nin the workplace.  \n5.10.  KiwiRail\
  \ has implemented a number of safety actions addressing some asp ects of the safety\
  \ \nissues relevant to poor stress and fatigue management . \nSupervision and support\
  \  \n5.11.  The train controller received no support and minimal supervision during\
  \ her 5 -hour shift , \ndespite the high demands of working a merged desk and the\
  \ higher -than-usual  level of risk \nassociated with this arrangement.  \n5.12.\
  \  The lack of proper supervision meant that no -one within train control was aware\
  \ of the train \ncontroller's workload and her increasing ly stressed state in the\
  \ last hour of her shift.  \n  \n\n<< Page 26 >>"
