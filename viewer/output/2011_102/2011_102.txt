Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to determine 
the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in 
the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or blame or 
determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been undertaken for 
that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accide nts and incidents for New Zealand, and  
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding simi lar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informin g members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Wednesday 13 April 2011,  a loaded coal tr ain was travelling through the Craigieburn -
Staircase area on the Midland Line, en route from Ngakawau to Lyttelton.  The coal train was 
travelling more slowly than usual because of  infrastructure worksites in the area and because 
it had a problem with its dynamic brake operation.  
1.2. A Kiwi Rail track engineer called the train controller and asked for permission to "on-track " his 
alicart  rail vehicle at Staircase and travel towards Craigieburn in order to reach a remote 
location not accessible by road.  The train controller assumed without ch ecking that the coal 
train had already passed Staircase going in the opposite direction, so she authorised the track 
occupation.  
1.3. The track engineer on -tracked the alicart and proceeded toward s the oncoming coal train.  A 
structures inspector  working in the  area at the time overheard the radio calls and recognised 
the potential for a near collision.  He alerted the coal train driver, who then stopped his train, 
narrowly averting a head -on collision in a tunnel.  
1.4. The near collision occurred because the train controller did not comply with KiwiRail rules and 
procedures , which  required her to  check where the loaded coal train was before authorising 
the track engineer to on -track his a licart.  There were also  a number of wider systemic issues 
beyond the train con troller's contro l, which  increased the risk of her making the error.  These 
were : 
 risk management of changes  to train contro l - the plan to merge 2 train control areas 
partially into a single desk was not assessed and managed in a way that recognised its 
higher -than -usual level of risk  
 stress and fatigue management in train control  - the train controller had been working 
almost 5 hours without a break on a single desk that covered one and a half geographic 
areas of train control.  The train controller was mentally fatigued and suffering from 
reduced blood glucose levels due to insuf ficient food intake at the time she made her 
error  
 supervision of and s upport for train controllers  - the train controller received no support 
and minimal supervision during her shift, even though she was performing a safety -
critical function with a higher -than -usual level of risk  
 rest breaks for train controllers during a shift - the train controller did not have a rest or 
get something to eat during her 5 -hour shift due to her h igh workload  
 the effect s of planning and co -ordinati ng track infrastructure activity on train control 
workload  - the train controller had an unrealistic workload for her to achieve a 
reasonable level of safety while operating the merged desk.  The unrealistic workload was 
in part due to the train controller having to deal with too many ad -hoc requests by 
maintenance personnel for access to the track during periods of frequent train activity.  
This was in part caused by inadequate pre -planning of kno wn maintenance activit ies 
across the rail network  
 train invisibility  - train controllers cannot see,  at a glance , where all train s and  all rail 
service vehicle s are on the rail network  at any time, despite the availability of technology 
to achieve this . 
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) made four recommendations 
to the Chief E xecutive of KiwiRail and one to the Chief E xecutive of the NZ Transport Agency to 
address these safety issues.  
1.6. The key lessons  from this inquiry were : 
 an organisation that performs a safety -critical function must have effective risk 
management systems in place.  The responsibilities of everyone involved in managing and 
implementing these systems must be clearly defined and well understood  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report  11-102  any changes to a safe ty-critical function that are likely to increase its risk profile must be 
properly  risk assessed and managed  
 persons who perform safety -critical  function s must be properly supervised and supported  
 an organisation that performs a safety -critical  function should foster a workplace culture 
that encourages its people to ask for help and to support one another  
 train controllers must be given adequate breaks during their shifts to eat and rest  
 an organisation that performs a safety -critical  function s hould have proper systems in 
place to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the workplace, including appropriate 
training and education  
 persons who perform safety -critical  function s must not be unduly burden ed by routine 
activities or distracted by unpla nned activities  
 people who contact train control must conduct themselves in a way that does not distract 
train controllers.  Their  communication must be clear , concise  and professional .  They 
should not say more than is required .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The NZ Transport Agency notified the Commission  of the incident  on the day it occurred .  After 
making preliminary enquiries , the  Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to determine its circumstances and 
causes .  An investigator  in charge  was assigned to investigate the incident . 
2.2. The next day the investigator  in charge travelled to the incident site.  In the next several days 
he interviewed  the following  KiwiRail personnel : 
 the train controller  
 the Manager Network Operations  
 the Network Control Manager  
 the structures inspector who  had alerted train control a nd the driver of the loaded coal  
train of the pending collision with the alicart  
 the persons in charge of 2 worksites between Stai rcase and Craigieburn  
 the track engineer who had been  driving the alicart  
 the driver of the loaded coal train  
 the driver -recruit who was with the driver of the loaded coal train at the time of the 
incident.  
2.3. The Commission then  engaged an industrial psychologist1 to help the Commission to gain a 
better understanding of train control's organisational health at the time of the incident, from 
both human factors and  organisational psychology perspective s.  This industrial psychologist  
and the Commission's  investigator  in charge interviewed 2 randomly selected train controllers 
who had not been invo lved in the incident (one with 2 years' train control experience and the 
other with 8 years ' experience).   They then re-interviewed : 
 the Manager Network Operatio ns 
 the Network Control Manager  
 the train controller who had been involved in the incident.  
2.4. The Commission's investigator also obtained a number of records and documents, including : 
 the train controller 's training records , her medical records (held by KiwiRail and her 
general medical practitioner ), and her work records, including the results of her various 
performance assessments  
 relevant KiwiRail policies and procedures . 
2.5. On 12 February 2013 Commissioners finalised a  draft final r eport regarding the incident and 
approved  it for distribution  to interested persons for comment.   Submissions were received  
from KiwiRail, the NZ Transport Agency, the train controller and the driver of the loaded coal 
train .  Commissioners considered thes e submissions at their April and May meetings . 
2.6. On 23 May 2013 Commissioners visited train control.  
2.7. On 22 and 23 May 2013 Commissioners considered another version of their draft report, and 
agreed that it should be redistributed to interested persons for further comment.  KiwiRail 
responded with a detailed submission, the train controller provided general comments only 
and the NZ Transport Agency confirmed that it did not wish to make any comments.

psychologist in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and more than  15 years in private practice working with a wide range of 
private and public sector organisations in New Zealand and Australia.  

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report  11-102 2.8. On 24 July 2013 Commissioners considered the submissions f rom KiwiRail and the train 
controller.  
2.9. On 21 August 2013, the Chief Executive  of KiwiRail  with the  General Manager, Infrastructure 
and Engineering in attendance  made further verbal submissions to the Commission.  The 
Commission made changes to the report a nd sent an updated copy to the Chief Executive of 
KiwiRail.  
2.10.  On 4 September 2013, the Chief Executive of KiwiRail submitted a final submission.  After 
making  appropriate changes to this report  to reflect this submission, the Commissioners  
approved this report for publication  on 26 September 2013 .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Events before  the incident  
3.1.1.  On 22 March 2011 KiwiRail 's Manager Network Operations , who was responsible for 
managing the day -to-day operations of the national train control centre , asked that special 
roster arrangements be put in place  for the period 8 April 2011 to 14 April 2011.  All 11 train 
controllers on the South Island roster  were required to attend a 3-hour training  course to 
prepare  for the planned relocation of the Invercargill signal box operation to t rain control . 
3.1.2.  On 5 April 2011 t he South Island roster co-ordinator (a senior train controller) said in an email 
to the Manager Network Operations that it was going to be difficult to complete the training 
requirements because of ex isting staffing commitments .  He suggested  that the planned 
relocation of the Invercargill signal box  and the training be deferred for 2 weeks .  The  Manager 
Network Operations responded by saying that this could not be done easily without incurring  
additional cost s. 
3.1.3.  The roster co-ordinator reviewed the roster , and the next day he emailed the Manager Network 
Operations  (and sent a copy  to the network control manager s and all train controllers ) 
confirming the arrangements for co-ordinating the training programme around train control 
activities from  8 April 2011 to 14 April 2011 .  His email did not specifically  say "The 
Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area will be merged and controlled by one train 
controller  between 0700 and 1600 on 13 April 2011 ". 
3.1.4.  However, the effect of his last email and the  roster  (which the email said was  posted on the 
roster board) was to merge these 2 areas , thereby creating  one and a half train control areas .  
One train controller, therefore, was to  control all trains and authorise all track occupations on 
all lines west of Rolleston.  The first shift on the day of the incident was to run from 0700 to 
1200 , with the second shift running from  1200 until 1600.  
3.1.5.  The Manager Network Operations said that h e did not realise from reading the email that the 
Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area would be merged on 13 April 2013.  
However, he  also added that even if he had, he had not need ed to approve  this merger .  
Instead, h e saw this decision resting with the roster co-ordinator , who he said was responsible 
for organising train controllers ' workloads . 
3.1.6.  On 11 April 201 1 the roster co-ordinator verbally told the train controller that she was rostered 
to work the 0700 to 1200 shift on 13 April 201 1.  The train controller  was aware that this 
would involve  controlling the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area.  Although she 
admitted to feeling anxious about this, she did not  tell the Manager Network Operations or the 
Network Control Manager  because she understood the decision to be  final.  The train 
controller said that she psych ed herself up during the next 2 days to do the shift, anticipating 
that it was going to be unusually  busy . 
3.2. Incident  on 13 April 2011  
3.2.1.  The train controller rose at 0445  and had a light breakfast  (a banana and yoghurt) .  This was 
the last food she consumed until after the incident, some 7 hours later.  The train controller 
left home (from  Te Horo ) at 0530 and drove  to work  at Wellington railway station .  The train 
controller  started work at 0650 .  At the end of her shift ( at 1200 ) she was scheduled to attend 
the training course  for relocating the Invercargill signal box operation . 
3.2.2.  For the most part, the train co ntroller's s hift was busy but uneventful .  However, the last hour 
of he r shift (which is when the incident occurred) was the busiest , with the train controller 
having to deal with 61 calls compared with 39 calls in the first hour of her shift, 45 calls in the 
second hour, 40 calls in the third hour and 39 calls in the fourth hour ( see Table 2 in 
paragraph 4. 4.1).  At no time during this shift did the train controller take a break  or get 
something to eat , because she  felt that  she could not leave her room due to  her high 
workload.  

<< Page 6 >>
 Final Report  11-102 3.2.3.  At 1014 a KiwiRail track engineer radioed the train control ler from Christchurch , inform ing her  
of his intention to travel  to a remote location between Springfield  and Staircase  on the 
Otira/Rolleston section .  The train control ler replied that a loaded coal train  was about to leave 
Arthurs Pass .  The track engineer decided instead to travel by road to Staircase  where he 
would call the train controller for a track occupation  authorisation .  The train controller 
acknowledged that decision . 
3.2.4.  At 1019 the train controller issued the loaded coal train driver with a running authori ty to 
travel from Arthurs Pass to Rolleston , crossing an opposing  passenger train at Cora Lynn and 
an opposing empty coal train at Springfield.  Seven minutes later the loaded coal train driver 
informed the train controller that he was experiencing locomotive dynamic -brake problems 
and requested  that l ocomotive control  be informed .   
3.2.5.  At 1049 t he loaded coal train  driver informed the train controller of his departure from Cora 
Lynn  after crossing the opposing passenger train.  
3.2.6.  At 1115 the loaded coal train driver informed the train controller of his progress through 
Craigieburn.   Around this time  the train control voice record er system showed  that the train 
controller was busy  but composed while dealing with a large  number of tasks .   
3.2.7.  Between 1119 and 1123  the loaded coal train stopped at a protected worksite at the  78.70 
km point .  Between 1145 and 1147 the loaded coal train stopped at a second protected 
worksite at the 70.50 km point . 
3.2.8.  Meanwhile  the train controller was becoming  increasingly  overwhelmed by her growing  
workload.  B etween 1 130 and 1150  the train control voice recorder system recorded e pisodes  
of the train controller swearing and sobbing  (off air) .  The train controller later said that a t 
about 1153 she became  further upset following an un welcomed comment from a track 
inspector , who was se eking a track occupation authorisation  in an other area that was 
congested with train activity . 
3.2.9.  Around 1150  the track engineer who had earlier advised the train controller of his intention  to 
travel to a remote location between Springfield and Staircase arrived by motor vehicle at 
Staircase.  He radioed the train controller asking for permission to travel on the  track by alicart  
from Staircase towards Craigieburn.  The train controller was now about 5 minutes from the 
end of her shift.  
3.2.10.  At 1155 the train controller authorised a 20 -minute track occupation for the track engineer .  
She did this without checking if th e loaded coal train had already passed through Staircase, 
instead assuming that it had.  She said that she had made this assumption because : 
 moments beforehand, a track maintenance worker had erroneously reported that the 
loaded coal train had passed his w orksite at about 26 km east of Staircase.  Although this 
was another train travelling in the opposite direction from the loaded coal train, and 
although the train controller had realised this error (and had corrected the maintenance 
worker), she said that the track maintenance worker's comments remained  
subconsciously  in the forefront of  her mind  
 she had earlier estimated that the loaded coal train would pass  through Staircase before 
1155.  However, this estimate was incorrect because the loaded coal train was travelling 
more slowly than expected because of brake problems.  
3.2.11.  If the train controller had stopped to check the signalling mimic screen , she would have seen 
that the loaded coal train had not yet pass ed through Staircase.  Further more , she should 
have  realised that  the driver of the loaded coal train had not yet radioed her confirming  that 
he had passed through Staircase.   These calls  to train control  are compulsory and are a key 
way of  monitoring trains ' whereabouts and progress.  
  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 7 >>
 3.2.12.  The loaded coal tra in driver did not hear  the train controller issuing the  track occupation 
authorisation  to the track engineer as  he was on another radio  channel .  Accordingly, he was 
not aware that his train and the alicart were now heading towards each other on the same 
track . 
3.2.13.  After obtaining  the track occupation authorisation , the track engineer began travelling towards 
Craigieburn on his alicart .  He began his journey about the same time that the loaded coal 
train was travel ling through a worksite over Broken River  (see map o n page iv).  The distance 
between the opposing movements was estimated to be about 5 km at that time.  
3.2.14.  In the meantime, a KiwiRail structures inspector working near  Bridge No.27  had his vehicle  
radio tuned in to train control 's radio frequency .  This was his normal practice .  He overheard 
the train controller authorising the track engineer's occupation towards a location near where 
he was working , and he  realised that a conflict situation had been created because  he did not  
hear the train controller re fer to the loaded coal train . 
3.2.15.  The structures inspector radioed  train control twice to alert the train controller about  the 
conflict , but he did not receive a response.  He then  selected the radio channel that  the 
loaded coal train was on, called the driver  and suggested that  the driver  stop his train.  The 
driver complied , stopping the loaded coal train at 1202 about 60 metres from the entrance to 
Tunnel 10  (see Figure 1). 
  
Figure 1  
Near -collision site  
3.2.16.  At this time  the track engineer was about midway  through the tunnel , but he stopped his 
alicart after seeing the  train's  headlights and hearing  a long blast on the whistle.  Shortly 
afterwards  the track engineer slowly made his way  towards the loaded coal train after realising 
that it was not moving.  The track engineer  then removed his alicart from the track and 
discussed the incident with the t rain driver  after exiting the tunnel .  They alerted train control 
to the incident , where a different train controller  had taken over the merged desk following a 
shift change.  
3.3. Train control  
3.3.1.  There are 10 train control areas in New Zealand, including the Otira/Rolleston section  and the 
West Coast area.  These areas are largely determined  by historical boundaries, which take into 
account  natural geographic  characteristics , the location s of major network junctions , the 
Auckland/Wellington metro operations , and technical constraints within the established train 
control radio system  and network connections .

 Final Report  11-102 3.3.2.  KiwiRail practice  is for one train controller to manage one train control area  during the day 
shift.  However, the configuration of these areas may change, and do change, daily  to take into 
account  the level s of rail activit y on the lines  and unexpected events , such as train controller 
sickness and leave, and seasonal and ad-hoc activit ies and events .  Acco rding to KiwiRail, 
daytime mergers , while not as regular as night -time mergers, were  also standard practice . 
3.3.3.  There is one train control centre  based in Wellington,  which oversees KiwiRail's entire rail 
network.  It has about 50  personnel, including the Manager Network Operations , 4 network 
control managers and up to about 35  train controllers.  
3.3.4.  Train controllers generally work in separate rooms located side by side down a long corridor  
(see Figures 2 and 3) .  Each room has a door with a glass window.  The  wall in each room, 
which is adjacent to the corridor , has a large window , thereby  enabling  a person standing in 
the corridor directly outside a room  to see a train controller at their desk.  By comparison , train 
controllers controlling the Auckland metro area work in another room, which is open plan.

3.3.5.  The train controller in this case was working in the second -to-last room at the  end of the 
corridor on the day of the incident (see Figure 3) .  Her door was closed  during her shift.   The 
Network Control Manager's office was located at the opposite end of the corridor, away from 
the train controller.

 3.4. Personnel  information  
Train controller  
3.4.1.  The prescribed duties of a train controller are reproduced in Appendix 1.   All tra in controllers 
report  to network control manager s. 
3.4.2.  The train controller had been  employed in 2007 after completing  pre-employment tests .  She 
then completed the formal train control training  programme and a period of on -the-job 
training .  Her training  did not cover  stress and fatigue management.  
3.4.3.  In 2007 and 2008, t he train controller became certified to perform train control duties on the 
main North and the main South lines , and in August 2009 she became certified to perform 
train control duties for the West Coast area. 
3.4.4.  KiwiRail's records and the train controller's personal records show ed that the train controller 
had not ha d any significant or reoccurring perf ormance or behavioural issues .  Between 31 
August 2009 and 13 April 2011  she received formal letters  for technical procedural errors , 
but otherwise  the r ecords from  8 train con trol desk  assessments  and voice -recorded activity  
assessments  performed during  2010 show ed that the train controller was consistently 
meeting  task requirements.  
3.4.5.  During the 10 -day period leading up to the incident, t he train controller worked the following 
roster  (her sleep pattern s during the  same period are also included ): 
Table 1: Roster and sleep patterns

13 April  0650* to 1630    
*Incident occurred at 1155.  
3.4.6.  There was not hing of concern with the train controller's roster or her sleep patterns  before the 
day of the incident . 
Train controller's health  status  
3.4.7.  The train controller  said that she had a long-term  medical condition with both  feet, for which 
she took pain relief from time to time , e.g. Panadeine  (an over -the-counter pain -relief drug) .  
About 20 years earlier , a growth known as a neuroma2 had been  surgically removed from the 
ball of one foot.  Another  neuroma had been  subsequently removed from the ball of her other 
foot about 15 years later . 
  
                                                        
2  A neuroma is a growth or tumour of nerve tissue.  It can be either benign or malignant.  

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report  11-102 3.4.8.  KiwiRail submitted  that it had not been aware of this medical condition  until after the incident , 
when it received the results of the train controller's post -incident drug test .  On the day of the 
incident, the train controller  had twice taken  Panadeine  to alleviate  discomfort in her foot .  Her 
post-incident drug test therefore revealed a positive result for codeine , an ingredient of 
Panadeine .  However, t he train controller's general practitioner  advised that  the dosage of 
Panadeine  taken by  the train controller on  the morning of the incident would not have affected 
her performa nce.  The Commission's medical advisor3 agree d. 
3.4.9.  KiwiRail also submitted  that the train controller's foot condition could have contributed to her 
fatigue and/or distracted her around the time she made her error.   However, the train 
controller strongly refut ed this .  She said : 
Management has stated that they knew nothing about my sore feet and as to which I would like 
to reiterate that it had absolutely nothing to do with the incident.  I have lived with sore feet for 
more than 20 years, coached gymnastics fu ll time for most of these, played softball and lived a 
normal life except that if I was a bit sore I would take a pain reliever to help.  Even now, I go on a 
hike with my neighbour 3 -4 times a week for an hour an d a half at a time.  It has never stopped 
me from doing anything.  
Manager N etwork Operations  
3.4.10.  The Manager Network Operations was a former train cont roller with extensive operations  
experience.  He was the most senior person at train control , with responsibi lity for managing 
and co-ordinating  the day-to-day train operations on the controlled network .  His position 
description required him to perform the following  responsibilities : 
 ensure  train control staff were appropriately trained and competent to perform their duties  
 identify  risks with train control function and mitigation strategies  
 overview  train control's safety performance.  
Network Control Manager  
3.4.11.  The Network Control M anager was the train controller's immediate manager.  He had a 
signaller background and lengthy operations experience.  Although he  had completed the 
requirements for train control , he had never practised as a train controller.  He was the most 
senior Network Control Manager in train control, having worked in this role for about 10 years.  
3.4.12.  His position description required him to perform  the following responsibilities:  
 supervise train controllers  
 mentor and support staff to ensure safety compliance and quality performance  
 notify rail operators of variances affect ing their respective operations  
 ensure that maintenance activity was planned to balance track quality and safety, and to 
meet rail operators' commercial objectives.  
Driver of loaded coal train and structures inspector  
3.4.13.  The driver of the loaded coal train and the structures inspector both held current certifications 
for their positions.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The Commission finds that the near -collision incident occurred  because  the train controller did 
not check the location of  the coal train and mistakenly a uthorised the track engineer  to on-
track his alicart and travel towards it on the same section of track.   This was contrary to 
standard protocol , which require d train controllers to check all train movements before 
granting track occupation authorisation s4.  But for the train controller's action, the 2 rail 
vehicles would not have been put into conflict.  
4.1.2.  However, the train controller' s error  was not hers alone .  Rather, a number of wider systemic  
factors  beyond the train controller's  control  created an envi ronment  that increased the 
likelihood of her  making this error , namely : 
 a planned change to the train controller's workload  was not assessed and managed in a 
way that recognised its higher -than -usual level of risk  
 the train control's workplace culture at the time of the incident did not encourage train 
controllers to ask for help  
 the train controller, who was performing a  safety -critical  function  with a higher -than -usual 
level of risk , was able to become highly stressed and mentally fatigued during her shi ft 
without anyone being aware of, or anticipating, this  
 minimal training and education about detecting and managing stress and fatigue was 
provided to the train controller (and other train controllers) before the incident , even 
though she was performing a safety -critical  function.  Further, poor systems existed within 
train control at the time of the incident to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the 
workplace  
 the train controller received no support and minimal supervision  during her shift even  
though she was  performing a safety -critical  function with a higher -than -usual level of risk  
 train control protocols required train controllers to work their shift s without scheduled 
breaks  
 poor  planning and co-ordination of  track  infrastructure  activity  unnecessarily  exacerbat ed 
the complexity  of the train controller's work  on the day of the incident .  Train controllers 
were responsible for co-ordinating and managing high volumes of routine and unplanned 
track infrastructure activit ies.  This increase d the complexity of their role.  In these 
situations, mistakes could occur  
 a significant portion of the controlled rail network, and therefore a large number  of trains 
and other rail vehicle s, were  not electronically visible to tr ain control at any given ti me. 
4.1.3.  Each of these factors was a  safety issue  - a condition within train control  that ha d the 
potential to create an unacceptable outcome , such as  personal harm or loss and/or property 
and environment damage.  All of these safety issues , collectively  contribut ed to the train 
controller making the error.

 Final Report  11-102 4.2. Risk management approach to assessing and managing a safety -critical  function  
Safety issue:  A planned change to the train controller's workload  was not assessed and 
managed in a way that recognised its higher -than -usual level of risk . 
4.2.1.  The primary role of all train control personnel (particularly train controllers)  is to prevent 
collisions, organise and expedite the safe movement  of rail traffic, and provide information 
and other support to all rail t rack users.  They perform a  safety -critical  function  similar to  air 
traffic contro llers; that is,  a function on which  people depend for their wellbeing.  Accordingly, 
if a train controller were to make a mistake, it could result in loss of life and/or sign ificant 
damage to property  and/ or the environment.  
4.2.2.  If the normal procedure is to have one train controller working one area, any change to this 
arrangement (no matter how small) may create additional risks  that KiwiRail  must properly  
assess and manage . 
4.2.3.  In this case, the merged desk arrangement  caused  a higher -than -usual level of risk  for train 
control because  it required one train controller to manag e one and a half train control areas  
during a weekday (i.e. when rail traffic was typically busy).  This larger area  included  the 
Otira/Rolleston section  (which form ed part of the Midland Line).  The Otira/Rolleston section  
typically ha d a high level of rail activity  and it  used a single -line automatic signalling  system , 
which  require d train controller s to issue running authorities  and to  record  manually  the 
location s of trains with the aid of  compulsory radio calls  from  drivers confirming  their 
location s.  This system relie d heavily on train controller s' memor ies and a high degree o f 
situational awareness (se e paragraph 4.8 for more details).  
4.2.4.  Train control management should have managed the risk of the train controller making an 
error by : 
 conduct ing a proper risk assessment of the merged desk  arrangement .  This should have 
involve d their identifying and analysing the risks associated with this arrangement , then 
putting in place  appropriate strategies to eliminate, minimise and/or manage these risks  
 properly assess ing whether the train controller was the right person, with the right skills 
and expertise , to carry out this activity  
 regularly monitor ing the effectiveness of the ir risk management strategies and the train 
controller's performance . 
4.2.5.  However, evidence reviewed by the Commission indicate d that no-one within train control 
conducted a thorough analysis of the risks  associated with merging the Otira/Rolleston 
section  and the West Coast area during the day , including the potential impact s of this 
arrangement  on the train controller's workload.  Further more , no appropriate arrangements  
were  put in place to manage these risks  or to ensure that the train controller was coping with 
her increased responsibilities.  
4.2.6.  KiwiRail submitted  that it did not consider a desk merger  to be a significant change that 
warranted a specific risk assessment , but r ather  it was "standard practice ".  KiwiRail  said:  
… the daytime merger of desks, while not as regular as it is at night, is not "unusual" at all as it is 
standard practice to accommodate events and other rostering  requirements by combining desks 
and accepting that prioritisation by the train controller will limit their responsiveness to lower 
priority requests.  
4.2.7.  KiwiRail also said:  
… KiwiRail does not agree that there was "a lack of proper risk management approach" as the 
matter referred to was the decision to merge  desks, which  was made in accordance with a 
standard practice, which  had not generated any lead indicators of concern…  
… The [Commission's] inference that a thorough risk analysis for the merging of the de sks is 
required appears excessive…  
… we submit that the merging of an area was not considered a "significant change" to warrant 
specific risk assessment…  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.2.8.  The Commission does not accept this view.  A merge d desk arrangement  might be standard 
practice for periods of low workload  (for example, at night for the Otira/Rolleston section) .  
However,  the usual arrangement  during the day was to have one train controller manage one  
train control area .  This was because of  the heavy w orkload that train cont rollers were 
expected to manage  on those sections during the day.  Accordingly, train control management 
should only have merged  these areas during the day after considering  the increased risk s for 
this safety -critical operation, and  then only after putting  in place appropriate measures to 
mitigate or control those risks.  At the very least, the Network Control Manager (as the train 
controller's direct manager ) should  have:  
 checked the train controller regularly  
 stayed with the train controller long enough  to get a good idea of her  workload and her 
ability to cope  with her additional responsibilities  
 taken the lead and directly asked the train controller how she was copin g rather than 
passively stood  back waiting for the train controller to say something  
 ensured that the train contro ller was able to, and did, take  short breaks , i.e. at least l ong 
enough for her to stretch, get a drink and something to eat , and go to the toilet.  
4.2.9.  The Commission saw no evidence that the Network Control Manager had done any of these 
things .  He w as the most senior person within train control, and was therefore  responsible for 
ensuring that the train control function was properly managed.  This should have include d 
ensuring that an appro priate risk management approach was applied whenever significant 
changes occur red to the train control function , and when such changes were  likely to affect its 
risk profile, such as when a train control area was to be  merged with another .  If this 
responsibility had been  delegated , the delegation should have been  properly documented, 
with people's roles and responsibilities clearly defined, and the appropriate processes put in 
place to provide him with assurance that this delegation was being  properly performed.  
4.2.10.  The Manager Network Operations said that he had not need ed to approve the merger as he 
saw this decision resting with the roster co-ordinator, who he said was responsible for 
organising train controllers' workloads.  However,  the Manag er Network Operations ' position  
description expressly required him to identify risks withi n train control and appropriate 
mitigation strategies , and to maintain an overview of train control's safety performance.  No 
documents were made available to the Com mission showing that this responsibility had been 
delegated to the roster co-ordinator or to anyone else.  
4.2.11.  Indeed, KiwiRail confirmed that no position description existed for the roster co-ordinator at 
the time of the incident .  Rather, the co-ordination of  fortnightly rosters within many parts of 
KiwiRail (not just train control) was performed by nominated member s of particular teams 
rather than a dedicated person.  Medium - and short -term changes to the train controller 
rosters , for example,  were undertaken  by 3 senior train controllers  at the time of the incident .  
KiwiRail said that this  arrangement  has since  changed with the establishment of a new roster 
co-ordinator function .  KiwiRail said that this role is now  performed  by a dedicated person 
rather tha n shared among senior train controllers , and that this  safety action was taken  partly 
in response to this incident . 
4.2.12.  KiwiRail also said that it was difficult for the roster co-ordinator  to predict the train controller's 
workload on the day , largely because of the level s of unplanned track infrastructure activity  
that might arise.   There was no evidence that the likely i mpact s of the merger  on the train 
controller's work load had been properly assessed  by management . 
  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report  11-102 4.2.13.  KiwiRail also said that the Manager Network Operations and the Network Control Manager 
had not been aware of the planned merger until the day of the incident and, therefore, they 
had been  unable to judge the potential effect s of this merger on the train controller's 
workload.   However, the roster co-ordinator had emailed the Manager Network Operations 
(and sent a  copy to the network control managers and train controllers) 6 days before the 
incident (i.e. on 6 April 2011 ), confirming the arrangements for co-ordinating the special 
training around  train control activities for the period from  8 April to 14 April.   Although the 
email did not specifically say , "The West Coast area and the Otira/Rolleston section  will be 
merged on 13 April 2011", the arrangements explained in  the email were in effect a merger of 
the 2 areas.  
4.2.14.  In its draft final report the Commission acknowledged  that the Manager Network Operations 
and the Network Control Manager may not have realised from reading this email or the roster 
that the 2 train contro l desks  would be merged.  This prompted the Commission to ask the 
following questions, to which KiwiRail replied, as follows:  
 were they  [the Manager Network Operations and the Network Control Manager] concerned 
about the merger when they did learn  about it on  the day of the incident ?  [KiwiRail reply:  
As previously discussed, they would not have been ] 
 were they concerned that they had only just become aware of it on the day of the 
incident?   [KiwiRail reply : No] 
 did they make enquiries to find out why they did not learn about it until the day of the 
incident ?  [KiwiRail reply : No as it was a regular procedure ] 
 did they make enquiries to assess the level of risk associated with the merger upon 
becoming aware of it?   [KiwiRail reply : No, as per above .] 
4.2.15.  KiwiRail's answers were  consistent with  its view  that a merged desk arrangement was not a 
significant change but rather standard practice .  However, this view overlook ed one 
fundamental point ; namely  that train control is a safety -critical  function .  In this case , the 
additional risks should have been considered.  
Findings  
1. Train control is a safety -critical  function on which  people depend for their wellbeing.   A 
mistake by a train controller could result in loss of life and/or significant damage to 
property and/ or the environment.  
2. Merging the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area created a higher -than -
usual level of risk for train control because it  resulted in 2 normally busy lines having 
to be managed by one train controller . 
3. KiwiRail did not properly assess  the implications  of merging the Otira/Rolleston 
section and the West Coast area during the daytime .  Accordingly,  it did not recognise 
the need for appropriate arrangements to be put in place to manage the risks 
associated with this merged desk arrangement . 
4. A merged desk arrangement  during daytime  was a change to the normal roster  that 
should have been assessed.  Appropriate  measures should  also have been put in 
place to mitigate or control the risks  arising from this change . 
 
  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.3. Organisational  culture  
Safety issue:  Train control's workplace culture at the time of the incident did not encourage 
train controllers to  ask for help .  
4.3.1.  The job description for network control managers contained  little reference to supporting and 
mentoring train controllers, and n one of the train control personnel interviewed said that they 
had received meaningful training  or mentoring  in how to manage workplace  stress, nutrition 
and fatigue.  
4.3.2.  Comments from the train controller and other train control personnel questioned by the 
Commission, as well as from various organisation documents , suggest ed that a workplace 
culture existed within train  control at the time of the incident that seemed to value those who 
operated independently and required minimal supervision and/or intervention.  These 
comments also indicated an unspoken understanding among train control staff that train 
controllers were expected to sort out their own problems.  
4.3.3.  To some extent, this was reinforced by the Network Control Manager , who said that he could 
not recall a time when a train controller had asked for help or had asked to be relieved from 
their duties because of a high workload.  It was also re inforced by the train controller , who 
said that she had received unhelpful respons es in the past when seeking support from some 
network control managers.  She believed that she was expected to get on with her job and just 
cope, no matter what.  To a large extent, this explains why the train controller did not feel 
comfortable asking for  help on the day of the incident.  
4.3.4.  Other indicators of the organisational culture within train control at the time of the incident 
can be seen from the following discussion about stress and mental fatigue, supervision and 
support and rest breaks.  
4.4. Stress and  mental fatigue  
Safety issue:  The train controller, who was  performing a safety -critical  function  with a higher -
than -usual  level of  risk, was able to become highly stressed and mentally fatigued during her 
shift without anyone being aware of, or anticipating, this.  
4.4.1.  The train controller's workload during her shift can be seen from data recorded on the train 
control voice recorder system  (see Table 2 ).  This data  shows the  number and types of radio 
calls to which  the train controller responded (hour by hour) during her 5-hour shift.  The 2 rows 
of sub -totals (in red) show the number of calls to which  2 train controllers would have 
responded if the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area had not been merged.

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report  11-102 4.4.2.  Table 2 shows that the train controller was consistently busy during her 5-hour  shift.  During 
her first 4 hours she received, on average, about 40 call s per hour as opposed to the about 3 0 
calls per hour she would have received if she had been working on the West Coast area alone .  
However, during her fifth and last hour (i.e. 1100 to 1200) the number of calls increase d to 
61.  It was during this time that the incident occurred ( 5 minutes before the end of her shift).  
4.4.3.  It was apparent  from the train control voice recorder system that the train controller was 
stressed  and distressed during the last hour of her shift .  For example, b etween  1130 and 
1150, the recording system  recorded episodes of the train controller swearing and sobbing  
(off air).  She could  also be heard repeatedly sighing , and in one case she seemed to be 
begging for the work  to "just stop".  
4.4.4.  At this time, the train controller was  dealing with : 
 a greater  numb er of calls th an she had been dealing with during each of the previous 4 
hours of her shift  
 a greater  number of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily had to deal with . 
4.4.5.  Other things were also happening to the train controller  at this time , which may have 
exacerbated  her stress and fatigue levels and affected he r ability to remain composed  and 
fully alert : 
 it is likely that the train controller's glucose ( energy ) levels were significantly  low 
immediately before, and at the time  that, she made her error .  During her 5-hour  shift the 
train controller felt she was unable to leave her desk to get something to eat or drink, or to 
go to the toilet .  By the time of the incident she had not e aten anything for about 7 hours  
(her most recent  meal was a light breakfast at 0445 ).  The train controller admitted to 
being hungry towards the end of her shift but said that the demands of working the  
merged desk meant  that she could not leave her room .  KiwiRail submitted  that the train 
controller  could ha ve taken informal breaks in  accordance with "normal practice ", noting 
in particular that "… [train control] has a practice of regular informal breaks and 
interactions, including food breaks for which a kitchenette facility is provided" .  However, 
the fact that scheduled breaks were not included in train controllers ' roster s meant that 
the t rain controller in this case could only take them as and when opportunit ies arose.  No 
such opportunit ies arose during her 5 -hour shift  because of her high workload  
 it is likely that the train controller was mentally fatigued immediately before, and at the 
time that, she made her error .  By the n the  train controller had worked  5 hours without a 
break  or food.  During this time she  had been  managing a higher workload t han usual , 
which had required  her full concentration at all times, with the need to  make split -second 
decisions , often while under pressure  
 it is possible that the  train controller was momentarily distracted by another  incident  at 
about 1153  (2 minutes before the incident).  This other incident involved  a track inspector  
repeatedly insist ing on accessing  a section of track that was congested with  train activity.  
The train controller admitted to bei ng unsettled by a comment from this track in spector  
(see the following section on planning and co-ordinati ng track infrastructure activity ). 
4.4.6.  Despite the train controller's growing stress  and fatigue during the last hour of her shift, no -
one within train control seemed to be aware of this .  Apart from 2 fleeting visits by the Network 
Control Manager at about 0800 and 0900,  no-one else checked or monitored the train 
controller  during her shift . 
4.4.7.  The Commission finds  it alarming that a  person performing a safety -critical  function  with a 
higher -than-usual level of risk  was able to  become  highly  stressed and mentally fatigued 
without anyone being aware  of, or anticipating , this. 
  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 17 >>
 Training and education  
Safety issue:  Minimal training and education about detecting and managing stress and 
fatigue was provided to the train controller (and other train controllers) before the incident , 
even though she was performing a safety -critical  function.  Further, poor systems existed  
within train control at the time of the incident to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the 
workplace.  
4.4.8.  Train control personnel questioned by the Commission said that they had received little 
training and education to help them manage stress and fatigu e effectively , or to help them 
identify others who might be experiencing these things.  Although there appeared to be a 
strong focus on procedural accuracy within train control, and an active assessment 
programme to monitor train controllers' technical per formance, there was little evidence of an 
equal emphasis on train controllers' physical and emotional wellbeing.  
4.4.9.  This is  surprising given the mentally challenging nature of train control and the pressure that 
comes with performing a safety -critical  functio n.  Train controllers are expected to make 
numerous split -second decisions on a daily basis, and to get these decisions right at all times.  
A momentary lapse of concentration could result in loss of life.  For most people, this type of 
responsibility woul d be hugely stressful.  
4.4.10.  It is difficult to say with certainty if and to what extent the train controller would have better 
managed her stress at the time of the incident if she had received proper training and 
education in these areas beforehand.  The effec ts of stress and pressure on individuals and 
their performance var y widely depending on factors such as age, work experience, personality 
traits, physical and mental health and attitude.  However, proper training and education about 
stress and fatigue for people performing safety -critical  functions should be mandatory, and 
train control should have appropriate systems and protocols in place to monitor and manage 
train controllers' stress and fatigue levels.  
Safety actions  
4.4.11.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of 2 safety actions that it had 
implemented:  
 an alertness management training programme for train controllers before starting on -the-
job training, with "refresher training" provided biennially after that  
 compulsory medical assessments for train controllers, including mental and physical 
checks.  
4.4.12.  On 2 July 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of a new managerial role (the train control 
manager), which had been  created in July 2011 partly in response to the Commission's inquiry 
into this incident .  The Commission unders tands that this  new role is specifically responsible 
for developing : 
 a staff support programme, which covers stress , fatigue management and staff well being  
 train controllers' supervisory competencies.  
4.4.13.  These steps are positiv e; however, it is still unclear to the Commission if appropriate systems 
have been established to detect and manage stress within train control.  If not, these are gaps 
that should be addressed.

 Final Report  11-102 Findings  
5. During the train controller's  last hour  of her shift she  dealt  with a greater  number of 
calls than she had  dealt with during each of the  previous  4 hours of her shift, and she 
dealt with a greater  number of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily 
had to deal with.  
6. The train controller was stressed,  mentally fatigued and operating well below an 
optimal level when she made her error.  
7. No-one within train control was aware of the train controller's growing stress and 
mental fatigue , even though she was performing a safety -critical  function  with a 
higher -than -usual level of risk . 
8. Proper training about managing stress and fatigue was not available to train control 
personnel before or at the time of the incident.  
9. No proper systems existed at the time of the incident to detect and manage stress 
and fatigue in the workplace.  
10. KiwiRail has implemented a number of safety actions address ing some a spects of the 
safety issues  relevant to poor stress and fatigue management . 
4.5. Supervision and support  
Safety issue:  The train controller received insufficient support and supervision  during her shift 
even though she was performing a safety -critical  function with a higher -than -usual  level of 
risk. 
4.5.1.  Despite the high demands of working a merged desk  and the higher -than -usual  level of risk 
associated with this arrangement, the train controller received  insufficient support and 
supervision during her 5-hour  shift.  
4.5.2.  The physical layout of train control meant that her manager, the Network Control Manager , 
could no t see or hear the train controller from his desk.  Accordingly, in order to monitor her, 
he needed to walk to the  train controller's room at the end of a corridor.  Further,  in order to 
get an accurate idea of the level of activity with which  the train con troller was dealing at any 
particular time, the Network Control Manager needed to go into her room and view the train 
controller's computer screens and train control diagram , and listen to her radio calls.  This 
could not be done  from his desk or from anywhere else within train control  (see the layout of 
train control in Figure s 2 and 3 , particularly the location of the Network Control Manager's 
desk in relation to the train controller's room ). 
4.5.3.  The Network Control Manager said that his usual appro ach for supervising train controllers 
was to peer into each train controller 's cubicle to get an idea of the level of activity that each 
person was managing and to ensure that trains were running smoothly and without incident.  
He said that s ometimes his  visits would be  fleeting to avoid distracting the train controllers , 
whereas at other times he would spend longer with each train controller.  In many cases , he 
said, his approach  at the time  would depend  on what was happening with each train controller 
and his own work priorities.  
4.5.4.  The Network Control Manager said that on the day of the incident he put his head into the 
train controller's cubicl e at about 0800 and 0900.  B oth visits were fleeting.  The train  control 
voice recorder system  showed  that the train controller was busy but composed  at these  times.  
Accordingly,  there was nothing for the Network Control Manage r to be concern ed about  at 
these times , in terms of  both  the train controller's performance and the level of activity with 
which  she w as dealing .  The Network Control Manager did not check the train controller again 
during her shift . 
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.5.5.  The Network Control Manager said that during his 10 years in the role he had never closed a 
train control desk or arranged relief for a train controller.  H e also said that if he saw a train 
controller struggling with high work demands , his usual approach would be to suggest  that 
they take a break.  If this had occurred in this case, then a t the very least the train controller 
would  have had time  to rest and get something to eat  and drink.  H owever, neither opportunity 
was available to her because the Network Control Manager largely left the train controller 
alone during her shift.  Accordingly, he remained unaware of the train controller's  needs and 
her incre asing ly stressed  state during the last hour of her shift.  
4.5.6.  The Network Control Manager also said that he expected train controllers to tell him if there 
was a problem , and to ask for help.  The Manager Network Operations also said  this, saying 
that if the train controller had had concerns about her workload she should have said so  
either before or during her shift .  The train controller, however, said that she did not feel 
comfortable doing this, partly because she believed that the ros ter was final and, therefore, 
not subject to discussion, and partly because she thought  that her concerns might not be 
acted on .  Accordingly, she remained silent.  
4.5.7.  The Commission accepts that people must  take responsibility for their own  wellbeing and that 
they cannot abdicate this responsibility entirely to their managers .  Accordingly, the  train 
controller  could  have told the  Network Control Manager that she was anxious about her shift 
as soon as she became aware of it , and she could have asked for help  during her shift when  
her workload was high .  In both cases, however, she chose not to (at least deliberately  in the 
first case and more likely  without thinking in the second  case  because she was too busy ). 
4.5.8.  However,  an employer has a responsibility to fost er a workplace culture that enables its 
employees to feel comfortable about speaking up and asking for help without fear of ridic ule 
or reprimand, particularly if that employer is in the business of performing a safety -critical  
function.  Comments from the  train controller and other train control personnel whom  the 
Commission questioned  suggest ed that there may have been an unspoken understanding 
within train control at the time of the incident that train control perso nnel were expected to get 
on with their  jobs and sort out their own problems.  
Findings  
11. The train controller received no support and minimal supervision during her 5-hour  
shift, despite the high demands of working a merged desk and the higher -than -usual  
level of risk associated with this arr angement.  
12. The lack of proper supervision meant that no -one within train control was aware of the 
train controller's workload and her increasing ly stressed state in the last hour of her 
shift.  
4.6. Rest breaks  
Safety issue:  Train control protocols required train controllers to work their shift s without any 
certainty of reasonable breaks.  
4.6.1.  Previous discussions in this report have talked about how the train controller's high workload 
meant that she was unable to have a break, get something to eat and drink and go to the 
toilet during her 5 -hour shift.  This discussion needs to be placed in context.  
  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report  11-102 4.6.2.  KiwiRail told the Commission that a  standard train controller shift was 8 hours  Monday to 
Friday, although in this case  the train controller was required to work a 5-hour shift so that she 
could attend a training session at the end of her shift.  Some weekend shifts were rostered for 
12 hours.  KiwiRail also told the Commission  that standard protocol within train control was 
not to provide train controllers with sche duled breaks within their shifts because of the need 
for them to be near their desks at all times to hear and respond to calls.  In particular KiwiRail  
said:  
Train control required train controllers to work their shift without scheduled breaks: but has a 
practice of regular informal breaks and interactions including food breaks for which a kitchenette 
is provided.  
4.6.3.  This meant that meal, toilet and rest breaks  were to be taken as and when opportunit ies 
arose, essentially during quiet period s.  In many cases then, train controllers would eat at their 
desks and have rest and toilet breaks as and when their workloads allowed them to.  
4.6.4.  KiwiRail also told the Commission that train controllers preferred this approach, which had 
been confirmed through their collectiv e employment bargaining negotiations.  Indeed, at least 
2 train controllers with whom  the Commission spoke said that they did not mind working their 
shifts without scheduled breaks.  In addition, the Commission made enquiries of the Accident 
Investigation Board in Norway and Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited5.  Both 
organisations confirmed a similar arrangement where train controller shifts were 8 hours, 
without scheduled breaks.  
4.6.5.  Notwithstanding this, there are obvious risks with people who perform safety -critical  functions 
working long hours without any certainly of reasonable breaks, particularly if the work required 
is complex and mentally demanding , such as train control.  The fact that someone else may be 
doing the same thing or that employees a nd their union may like what is being done is not a 
good reason for continuing an arrangement involving a safety -critical  function  that may give 
rise to significant risks, particularly if these risks are not properly identified and managed.  
There is a wea lth of cases in which long and irregular working hours have contributed to  
people making errors and that have been associated with a range of physical and mental 
health and injury risks (International Labour O rganisation , 2011).  Five hours (and certainly 8 
or 12  hours) without any certainty of a reasonable break is a long time to expect a person to 
remain fully alert and in peak mental form.  
4.6.6.  Further, KiwiRail's policy that rest breaks should be taken as and when opportunit ies arise 
fails to take account of  the "overworked or extremely busy train controller "; that is, the train 
controller whose workload is so high that they are  unable to leave their desk.  This was the 
case here.  The fact that the train controller could not leave her room to get something t o eat 
and drink or to go to the toilet during her 5 -hour shift because of her workload was 
unacceptable.  Not only was this unsafe for the train controller because of the potential 
effect s on her mental and physical wellbeing , it was also potentially unsafe for those relying on 
her to perform her safety -critical  function without error.  
4.6.7.  As a rough comparison, the Commission asked Airways New Zealand to confirm the breaks 
provided to air traffic controllers.  Air traffic controll ers with radar duties had break s every 2 
hours, air traffic control planners every 2.5 hours and international air traffic controllers every 
3 hours.  The general rationale for these breaks was largely to minimise the effects of fatigue 
(e.g. mental fatigu e and eye fatigue for those looking at radar screens for long periods of 
time).  
4.6.8.  The Commission does not accept that KiwiRail's approach to rest breaks , where its train 
controllers work 8 - or 12 -hour shift s without certainty of reasonable breaks, is safe - certainly  
not without proper processes in place to manage and mitigate  properly  the risks of this 
approach , such as fatigue and stress.  This is a significant safety issue that must be properly 
assessed and managed.  
                                                        
5  Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited is responsible  for the management of more than  8500 route kilometres of standard -
gauge interstate track in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.  It also manages the 
Hunter Valley coal rail network, and other regional rail links, in New South Wales.  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 21 >>
 Findings  
13. Train control protocols req uired train controllers to work their shift s without 
scheduled breaks.  Meal, toilet and rest breaks were to be taken as and when 
workloads permitted . 
14. The train controller believed that she could not leave her room during her 5 -hour 
shift because of her high workload.  Accordingly, she did not  have a rest, get 
something to eat or drink or go to the toilet during her shift.  Not only was this unsafe 
for the train controller because of the pote ntial effect s on her mental and physical 
wellbeing , it was also unsafe for those relying on her judgement.  
15. KiwiRail's approach to rest breaks, where its train controllers work 8 -hour shift s 
without any certainty of breaks, is not safe - certainly not w ithout proper processes 
in place to manage and mitigate  properly  the risks of this approach such as fatigue 
and stress.  This is a significant safety issue that must be properly assessed and 
managed.  
4.7. Planning  and co-ordination of track infrastructure activity  
Safety issue s: Poor planning and co-ordination of track infrastructure activit ies unnecessarily  
exacerbated the complexity of the train controller's work on the day of the incident.  Train 
controllers are responsible for co-ordinating and managing high volumes of routine and 
unplanned track infrastructure activit ies.  This increase s the complexity of their role.  In these 
situations, mistakes c an occur . 
4.7.1.  Train control personnel questioned by the Commission said that about  50% t o 80% of their  
calls on a typical weekday could  involve  routine repair, maintenance and inspection activit ies.  
Most  of these, they said, could also be unplanned ; that is, infrastructure personnel  calling 
train control "out of the blue " asking to occupy section s of rail track at any given time.  Often, 
they said, track staff could be insistent , thereby putting pressure on train controllers to issue 
them with track occupation authorisations . 
4.7.2.  On the day of the incident  the train control vo ice recording showed that the train controller  
handled  79 calls from infrastructure personnel  requesting track occupation s for routine track 
maintenance and inspection tasks  in the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area.  
None of these requests ha d been pre -planned with train control  except for the trip involving  
the track engineer.  In addition, the train controller  handled  6 calls from the West Coast area 
for routine on -track maintenance and inspection activities.   That made 85 calls for routine 
work  (out of a total of 224 calls) , which were for unplanned work . 
4.7.3.  Rathe r than declining those calls, there by taking some pressure off her self, the train controller 
dealt with all of them as and when they came in.  This was  standard practice within train 
control.  The train controller believed that this was expected of her and other train controllers.  
4.7.4.  By extrapolating the figure of 85 calls (taking into account a shortened 5 -hour shift instead of 
the usual 8 -hour shift), the  Commission roughly estimates  that in excess of 500 calls for 
routine and unplanned track occupations could be made across all 10 train control desks on 
any given weekday.  If even remotely accurate, this number is significant . 
4.7.5.  KiwiRail submitted  that train controllers could decline track occupation authorisations during 
busy work periods.  However, it was unclear to the Commission how a train controller was 
expected to exercise this authority.  Train controllers are not fully trained in schedulin g and 
prioritising infrastructure repair s and maintenance .  They are not  privy to decisions and 
information about which  repair and maintenance tasks  are high priorities and which  are not .  
Accordingly, even though they may have the authority to decline tra ck occupations,  train 
controller s are unlikely to know if their  decision s will affect  the safety and efficiency of the 
railway infrastructure that is to be in spected, repaired and maintained.  

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report  11-102 4.7.6.  KiwiRail also submitted  that a core requirement of any train controller was to prioritise their 
workload issues irrespective of whether desk s were merged or not.  KiwiRail said : 
In all railways, and most infrastructures for that matter, the management of the interface 
between in frastructure maintenance and real time operations is an inherent function that 
requires command and control.  It is not valid to conclude that this 'places unreasonable 
pressure' on the controller.  
4.7.7.  The Commission accepts that a core function of train contr ol is to manage the interface 
between infrastructure maintenance and real -time train operations.  It also accepts that every 
person, no matter what organisation they are with and no matter what role they perform, must 
prioritise their work demands.  Howeve r, KiwiRail's comments miss a fundamental point  - that 
train controllers perform the safety -critical  role of managing the safe movement of rail traffic 
across the entire national rail network.   It is concerning then that they are also  expected  to co-
ordina te and manage a high volume of routine and unplanned track infrastructure activit ies on 
an ad -hoc basis .  The more of this work that is pre -planned by KiwiRail's  Infrastructure and 
Engineering team, the easier it will be for the train controllers to manage  the interface 
between infrastructure maintenance and real -time operations.  
4.7.8.  In terms of this incident,  the train controller's workload  on the day of the incident would  have 
been less demanding if : 
 proper processes had been in place  at the time of the incident  to better co -ordinate and 
manage track infrastructure activity  to ensure , for example, that the train controller only 
received track occupation requests for  priority,  planned tasks only 
 the train controller had known  that she had the ability  to decline track occupation 
requests for routine  maintenance tasks . 
4.7.9.  Whether or not this would have been enough to prevent the train controller  making the error is 
unknown ; however, at the very least it would  have decreased the likelihood of her doing so . 
4.7.10.  Finally, the train controller referred to a sarcastic comment made by a track inspector shortly  
before the incident, which unsettled her.   Given the critical and complex role that train 
controllers perform,  it is important  that people who contact  train control conduct themselves 
in a way that does not distract train controller s.  KiwiRail  has operating protocols for 
communications to train control and standard radio phraseology6, which require 
communications t o be clear, concise and focused .  Casual conversation , superfluous 
information and unnecessary comments are not permitted .  It is important that  KiwiRail has 
proper  protocols  in place to monitor people's compliance with these protocols . 
Safety action s 
4.7.11.  During the course of this inquiry KiwiRail created a new position within  its infrastructure and 
engineering division  with responsibility for developing and implementing a system to integrate  
track occupations better with the  running of trains.  This is a p ositive step, particularly if the 
new system is operational  and track infrastructure activity  is better co -ordinated and 
managed.  The Commission would welcome  comment from KiwiRail on the status and 
effectiveness of this safety action, particularly in terms of whether or not it has reduced , or is 
reducing,  the number  of calls  to train controllers for unpredicted track occupation 
authorisations.

Final report  11-102 
<< Page 23 >>
 4.7.12.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission that it was in the early stages of moving 
the fortnightly co-ordination of train control rosters to a single non -train -controller co-ordinator.  
This person will use a dedicated computerised application that will provide improved 
monitoring and reporting of all roster arrang ements.  This safety ac tion is also positive, 
provided that this person's role and responsibilities are well defined , and proper processes 
are in place to require them  (or who mever the appropriate person is) to assess properly (from 
a risk management persp ective) the impact s of any changes on train controllers' workload  and 
on train control generally.  
4.7.13.  On 27 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission about Train Control Instruction A028 
(dated 11 October 2012) entitled Train Control ler Workload Management .  This instruction 
confirm ed (among other things) that train controllers could  decline requests, prioritise calls 
and not respond to low -priority calls or tasks if they were  dealing with higher -than -usual  
workloads.  This safety action is promising ; howev er, Instruction A028 does not make it clear 
how train  controllers are expected to know which  routine track infrastructure activit ies to 
prioritise or decline without proper guidelines and scheduling plans available to them.   For 
example, given that train c ontrollers are not fully trained in scheduling or in infrastructure 
repair and maintenance, and given that they are not privy to decisions and information about 
which  activit ies are  high priority or not, how are they expected to prioritise routine 
maintena nce or inspections  properly under Instruction A028?  
4.7.14.  On 2 July 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of a national business improvement project 
that it  had initiated in 2010 to move the prioritisation , planning and scheduling of 
infrastructure activity to a n electronic system called a n IBM Maximo platform.  KiwiRail 
confirm ed that the roll -out of this system had begun in June 2013 following a series of pilots, 
which showed that unplanned track infrastructure activities could be reduced to less than half 
their former level s. 
4.7.15.  KiwiRail also noted the introduction of a series of measures to improve safety and pro ductivity 
by reducing the amount of work undertaken where trains and track infrastructure activit ies 
occur.  The first trial s of these measures were comm enced on the East Coast Main Trunk 
during  early 2013 , with a further trial on the Midland and Stillwater/Ngakawau  Lines during  
July 2013.  
Findings  
16. The t rain controller had to deal with a high volume of routine and unplanned track 
infrastructure activit ies during her shift.  The poor planning and co-ordination of 
these activit ies unnecessarily exacerbated the complexity of her work.  
17. Train controllers , generally,  have to deal with a high volume of rout ine and 
unplanned track infrastructure activit ies in addition to managing the flow of rail 
traffic .  This increase s the complexity of their role by requiring them to manage and 
co-ordinate  large volumes of unknown and unplanned work.   In these 
circumstances, mistakes can occur.  
18. KiwiRail has implemente d a number of safety actions to address the risks 
associated with train controllers co -ordinating and managing the interface between 
infrastructure activities and rail movements.  
  

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report  11-102 4.8. Knowing where rail vehicles are on the rail network  
Safety issue:  A large number  of rail movements and track activities are not electronically 
visible to train control at any given time.  
4.8.1.  In New Zealand, about 40% of the controlled network is configured with one of 4 types of 
automatic signalling system .  Trains operating within automatic signalling systems are for the 
most part  displayed  on train controllers ' mimic screen s.  The other 60% of the controlled 
network is track warrant control territory , colloquially referred to as "dark territory ".  Trains 
operating in track warrant control territory are not electronically visible to train controllers.  
Other rail vehicles such as hi-rail vehicles are not electronically visible to train controllers 
anywhere on the controlled network.  
4.8.2.  The Midland Line, which includes the Otira/Rolleston section, is also the only line in New 
Zealand that operates single -line automatic signalling , one of the 4 types of automatic 
signalling .  Along  this line  are 15 crossing stations .  As a train pass es through 4 of these 
stations, signal s are triggered and relayed  back to train control .  These signal s appear  on a 
mimic screen  that the train controller can see, thereby telling the train controller which 
crossing station s the train has passed.  Apart from when a train passes one of these 4 
stations, the train is not  electronically visible to train control.  
4.8.3.  Accordingly, a train controller will only know the approximate location of a train on the Midland  
Line by  relying on : their paper -based train control diagram ; the issue of running authorities ; 
and compulsory radio calls from train drivers.   This system relie s heavily on train controller s 
having  a high degree of situational awareness and excellent memor ies.  It also relies on train 
controller s accurately recording  trains ' progress on train control diagram s, and  on train drivers 
and other track users complying with the terms of their running authorities and track 
occupations . 
4.8.4.  A train controller's job would be easier, and public safety would be i mproved, if all trains and 
hi-rail vehicles on the controlled rail network were electronically visible to them at all times.  
Since this incident , KiwiRail has developed a system that shows train controllers the location s 
of all trains over 95% of its cont rolled network with a reasonable level of accuracy.  The 
system, known as "GeVIS ", uses global positioning system technology.  A project to provide 
visibility for hi -rail vehicles through the same system is nearing completion.  
4.8.5.  If the train controller in this case had had access to the GeVIS system and could  have seen , at 
a glance, all train movements along the Otira/Rolleston section  in real time, and if she had 
glanced at the screen before issuing the track occupation authorisat ion to the track engineer, 
she would have seen that the loaded coal train had not yet passed Staircase.  
Finding s 
19. Single -line automatic signalling, by itself, did not directly contribute to the incident.  
Rather, it was more a factor that increased the complexity of the train controller's 
job on the day of the incident.  Given this, the signalling system should have been 
properly examined as part of a wider risk assessment of the merger.  
20. A train controller's job would be easier, and public safety would be improved, if all 
trains and hi -rail vehicles on the controlled rail network were electronically visible 
to train control at all times.  That way, they could see at a glance all rail vehic le 
movements on a particular track at any given time.   Since this incident, KiwiRail 
has introduced a system that makes all trains on 95% of its controlled network 
electronically visible to train controllers.

 5. Findings  
Risk management approach to assessing and managing a safety -critical  function  
5.1. Train control is a safety -critical  function on which  people depend for their wellbeing.   A mistake 
by a train controller could result in loss of life and/or significant damage to property  and/ or 
the environment.  
5.2. Merging the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast area created a higher -than -usual  level 
of risk for train control  because it  resulted in 2 normally busy lines having to be managed by 
one train controller . 
5.3. KiwiRail did not properly assess the implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section and 
the West Coast area during the daytime .  Accordingly, it did not recognise the nee d for 
appropriate arrangements to be put in place to manage the risks associated with this merged 
desk arrangement.  
5.4. A merged desk arrangement during daytime  was a change to the normal roster  that should 
have been assessed.  Appropriate measures should also  have been put in place to mitigate or 
control the risks arising from this change.  
Stress and mental fatigue  
5.5. During the train controller's last hour of her shift she dealt with a greater  number of calls than 
she had dealt with during each of the previous 4  hours of her shift, and she dealt with a 
greater  number of calls th an she, and other train controllers, ordinarily had to deal with.  
5.6. The train controller was stressed, mentally fatigued and operating well below an optimal level 
when she made her error.  
5.7. No-one within train control was aware of the train controller's growing stress and mental 
fatigue , even though she was performing a safety -critical  function with a higher -than -usual  
level of risk.  
5.8. Proper training about managing stress and fatigue was not ava ilable to train control personnel 
before or at the time of the incident.  
5.9. No proper systems existed at the time of the incident to detect and manage stress and fatigue 
in the workplace.  
5.10.  KiwiRail has implemented a number of safety actions addressing some asp ects of the safety 
issues relevant to poor stress and fatigue management . 
Supervision and support  
5.11.  The train controller received no support and minimal supervision during her 5 -hour shift , 
despite the high demands of working a merged desk and the higher -than-usual  level of risk 
associated with this arrangement.  
5.12.  The lack of proper supervision meant that no -one within train control was aware of the train 
controller's workload and her increasing ly stressed state in the last hour of her shift.  
  

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report  11-102 Rest breaks  
5.13.  Train control protocols required train controllers to work their shift s without scheduled breaks.  
Meal, toilet and rest breaks were to be taken as and when workloads permitted.  
5.14.  The train controller believed that she could not leave her room during her 5 -hour shift because 
of her high workload.  Accordingly, she did not have a rest, get something to eat or drink or go 
to the toilet during her shift.  Not only was this unsafe for the train controller because of the 
potential effect s on her mental and physica l wellbeing , it was also unsafe for those relying on 
her judgement.  
5.15.  KiwiRail's approach to rest breaks, where its train controllers work 8 -hour shift s without any 
certainty of breaks, is not safe - certainly not without proper processes in place to manage 
and mitigate  properly  the risks of this approach such as fatigue and stress.  This is a 
significant safety issue that must be properly assessed and managed.  
Planning and co-ordination of track infrastructure activity  
5.16.  The train controller had to deal with a  high volume of routine and unplanned track 
infrastructure activit ies during her shift.  The poor planning and co-ordination of these  
activit ies unnecessarily exacerbated the complexity of her work.  
5.17.  Train controllers, generally, have to deal with a high vo lume of routine and unplanned track 
infrastructure activit ies in addition to managing the flow of rail traffic.  This increases the 
complexity of their role by requiring them to manage and co-ordinate large volumes of 
unknown and unplanned work.  In these circumstances, mistakes can occur.  
5.18.  KiwiRail has implemented a number of safety actions to address the risks associated with 
train controllers co -ordinating and managing the interface between infrastructure activities 
and rail movements.  
Knowing where rail vehicles  are on the rail network  
5.19.  Single -line automatic signalling, by itself, did not directly contribute to the incident.  Rather, it 
was more a factor that increased the complexity of the train controller's job on the day of the 
incident.  Given this, the signalling system should have been properly examined as part of a 
wider risk assessment of the merger.  
5.20.  A train controller's job would be easier, and public safety would be improved, if all trains and 
hi-rail vehicles on the controlled rail network were  electronically visible to train control  at all 
times .  That way, they could see at a glance all rail vehicle movements on a particular track at 
any given time.   Since this incident, KiwiRail has introduced a system that makes all trains on 
95% of its cont rolled network electronically visible to train controllers.

 6. Key lessons  
6.1. An organisation that performs a safety -critical  function must have effective ris k management 
systems  in place .  The responsibilities of everyone involved in managing and implementing 
these systems must be clearly defined and well understood.  
6.2. Any changes to a safety -critical  function that are likely to increase its risk profile must be 
properly risk assessed and managed . 
6.3. Persons who perform safety -critical  function s must be properly supervised and supported.  
6.4. An organisation that performs a safety -critical  function should foster a  workplace culture that 
encourages its  people to ask for help and to support one anoth er. 
6.5. Train controllers must be given adequate breaks during their shifts to eat and rest.  
6.6. An organisation that performs  a safety -critical  function should  have proper systems in place to 
detect and manage s tress and fatigue in the workplace, including approp riate training and 
education.  
6.7. Persons  who perform safety -critical  function s must  not be unduly burden ed by routine 
activit ies or distracted  by unplanned activities.  
6.8. People who contact train control must conduct themselves in a way that does not distract train 
controllers.  Their communication must be clear , concise and professional .  They should not 
say more than is required .

 Final Report  11-102 7. Safety a ctions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The incident occur red more than 2  years ago.  Since then KiwiRail has implemented a number 
of safety actions to address some of the safety issues (or parts of the safety issues) identified 
in this report.  These are listed below.  
7.1.2.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2.1.  On 13 April 2011 KiwiRail issued a Safety Briefing to train contr ol personnel about track 
occupancy accuracy (see Appendix 2).  This Briefing provide d guidelines to help train 
controllers ensure  that track occupation authorisations were  accurate and clear.  
7.2.2.  On 18 June 2012 KiwiRail informed the Commission  that the train  control radio computer 
system had been upgraded with an option for train controllers to use a keyboard -initiated 
"push to talk " function in addition to the standard foot pedal option.  
7.2.3.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission that train controller s were being  
provided with alertness management training before starting on -the-job training , and  
biennially after that.  It had also introduced compulsory medical assessments for all train 
controllers on 1 April 2012, including mental and physical checks.   
7.2.4.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission that it was in the early stages of moving 
the fortnightly co-ordination of t rain control rosters to a single non -train -controller  co-ordinator.  
This person will use a dedicated computerised application that will provide improved 
monitoring and reporting of all roster arrangements . 
7.2.5.  On 22 March 2013 KiwiRail informed  the Commission  that it had issued  Train Control 
Instruction A028 (dated 11 October 2012) concerning train control workload management.  
This instruction confirm ed (among other things) that train controllers could  decline requests, 
prioritise calls and not respond to low -priority calls or tasks if they were  dealing with higher -
than -usual  workloads (see Appendix 3) .   
7.2.6.  On 2 July 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission of 2 new roles within train control  that had 
been  established, in part, because of this incident, i.e. the tr ain control manager and the 
roster co -ordinator.  
7.2.7.  On 4 September 2013 KiwiRail informed the Commission that all trains are now electronically 
visible to train controllers through a system called 'GeVIS'.  A project to provide visibility for hi -
rail vehicles  through the same system is nearing completion.

 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending o n 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector . 
8.1.2.  In this case the Commission makes  four recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail .  
KiwiRail is the appropriate organisation to address the safety issues addressed i n these 
recommendations as the issues arose from the operations of one of  its business unit s (train 
control).  
8.1.3.  The final  recommendation  is made  to the Chief Executive of the N Z Transport Agency.   The N Z 
Transport Agency has various  powers  under the Railways Act 2005 to monitor and ensure rail 
participant s' performance and compliance .  The Commission , therefore,  recommend s that the  
NZ Transport Agency exercise all appropriate  powers  to ensure  that KiwiRail is taking all 
appropriate steps to implement its recommendations . 
8.1.4.  In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Recommendation  1 
8.2.1.  A standard arrangement where one train controller manages one train control area has a high 
risk profile simply because of the nature of the role (i.e. it is a safety -critical  function) .  A 
change to this standard arrangement (no matter how small) will, in many cases, present new 
and at times additional risks, which must be properly assessed and managed.  
8.2.2.  On the day of the incident, a change to the standard train control arrangement saw a tra in 
controller controlling one and a half train control areas  (i.e. the Otira/Rolleston section  and the 
West Coast area).  This arrangement had a higher -than -usual  level of risk because it affected a 
busy rail line that operated a single -line automatic sign alling system .  The arrangement was 
also to apply on a weekday when rail activity was normally busy.  
8.2.3.  Evidence reviewed by the Commission indicate d that train control management  did not  
properly assess  the implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section  and the West Coast 
area.  Accordingly, it did not recognise the need for appropriate arrangements to be put in 
place to manage the risks associated with this arrangement.  
8.2.4.  As a result, a train controller was  largely  left alone for 5 hours to control this merged  area with 
minimal supervision and support.   Evidence shows that towards the end of her shift the train 
controller was stressed and mentally fatigued.  No-one within train control was aware of this or 
the train controller's high workload.  It was duri ng this period that  the train controller made an 
error, which resulted in the incident.  
The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail  ensure that  train control 
management has : 
 appropriate risk management protocols in place  to assess and manage all risks 
associated with the train control function  (including risks associated with merging train 
control desks ), and that all relevant train control personnel are aware of these protocols 
and comply with  them  
 appropriate procedures  in place to provide him and the Board of KiwiRail with assurance 
that train control is exercising an appropriate risk management approach to its 
operations.  (013/13)  
  

<< Page 30 >>
 Final Report  11-102 8.3. Recommendation  2 
8.3.1.  Evidence reviewed by the Commission show ed that at the time of the incident : 
 train control's workplace culture seemed to value those who operated independently 
and with minimal supervision  
 minimal training and education about detecting and managing stress and fatigue had 
been  provided to train controll ers, notwithstanding  the safety -critical  function  that they 
were performing  
 poor systems existed within train control to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the 
workplace  
 the standard protocol within train control was to not provide train controllers w ith any 
certainty of reasonable breaks during their shifts . 
8.3.2.  KiwiRail has implemented safety actions to ensure that train controllers receive alertness 
management training and medical assessments .  However, the Commission is not convinced 
that these safety actions fully address the safety issue s that it has identified  regarding 
workplace culture , training and education . 
The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure  that train control 
management has appropriate arrangements in place to : 
 detect and manage stress and fatigue, including appropriate training and education  
 remind train controllers about the importance of eating properly and regularly during 
their shifts  
 provide train controllers with certainty of reasonable breaks during the ir shifts . (014/13)  
8.4. Recommendation 3  
8.4.1.  Evidence reviewed by the Commission show ed that train controllers often had to deal with a 
high volume of routine and unplanned track infrastructure activit ies (e.g. track inspections and 
maintenance)  in addition to managing the movement  of rail traffic.  This could  increase  the 
complexity of their role by requiring  them to manage and co-ordinate large volumes of 
unknown and unpredicted work.  In these circumstances, mistakes could  occur.    
8.4.2.  People who perform safety -critical  function s should not be unduly  distracted or burdened by 
routine and unplanned track infrastructure activit ies.   
8.4.3.  KiwiRail has implemented safety actions to try to better co-ordinate routine and unplanned 
infrastructure activit ies with the movement  of rail traffic.  However, the Commission is not 
convinced that these fully address the safety issue that it has identified relating  to routine and 
unplanned track infrastructure activit ies. 
The Commission recommends that the Chief Execut ive of KiwiRail  ensure  that appropriate 
protocols and/or arrangements are in place , and are being applied,  to manage and co-
ordinate routine and unplanned track infrastructure activit ies properly , so that train 
controller s are able to perform their safety -critical function without becoming unduly 
distracted or burdened . (015/13)  
  
  
Final report  11-102 
<< Page 31 >>
 8.5. Recommendation 4  
8.5.1.  At the time of this incident , trains were electronically visible to train controllers on only 40%  of 
the New Zealand controlled rail network.  Other rail vehicles, such as hi-rail vehicles, were not 
electronically visible on any of the controlled rail network.  This ma de it challenging for train 
controllers to determine the exact location s of rail movements and track activities on the 
network in all cases.  The best they c ould do was to determine the most likely location s using 
a range of mechanisms, including a train control diagram, mimic screens, information from 
the electronic train register, compulsory radio calls and the "read back " of commu nications.  
For the most part, these mechanisms work ed well.  
8.5.2.  However, rail vehicles not being electronically visible  will always present a challenge to train 
controllers , who must interpret, analyse and understand information .  This makes their job s 
comple x and demanding.  High reliance on human input means that there will always be a risk 
of human error.  
8.5.3.  Since this incident , global position ing system technology has become  available that will enable 
train controllers to see  train movements across 95% of the  controlled network in real time with 
a reasonable level of accuracy.  KiwiRail intends to extend  this technology to other rail vehicles 
as well . 
8.5.4.  If the train controller in this case had had access to this technology and could have seen , at a 
glance, all train movements along the Otira/Rolleston section in real time, and if she had 
glanced at the screen before issuing the track occupation authorisation to the track engineer, 
she would have seen that the loaded coal train had not yet pass ed Staircase.  
The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail take all appropriate steps 
to ensure that all rail vehicles travelling on the controlled rail network are electronically visible 
to train control.  (016/13 ) 
8.5.5.  On 14 October 2013, Kiw iRail responded:  
Recommendations 013/13, 014/13, 015/13 and 016/13 made to the Chief 
Executive of KiwiRail are accepted.   Recommendation 017/13 directed to the Chief 
Executive of the NZ Transport Agency is noted.   KiwiRail will begin discussions with 
the N Z Transport Agency on the strategies to implement these recommendations 
upon release of this report.   Details on these strategies along with projected 
timeframes for implementation will be advised to the Commission.  
8.6. Recommendation 5 
8.6.1.  The Commission has made  4 recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail , that he 
ensure that : 
 appropriate risk management protocols are in place to assess and manage risks 
associated with train control , and to ensure that these protocols are followed  
 appropriate arrangements  are in place to detect and manage stress, to remind train 
controllers about the importance of eating properly and regularly during their shifts, and to 
provide train controllers with proper and regular rest breaks during their shift s 
 appropriate protoco ls are in place and are being applied to manage and co-ordinate 
routine and unplanned track infrastructure activiti es properly  
 appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that rail vehicles on the controlled rail 
network are electronical ly visible to train control.  
8.6.2.  It is important that KiwiRail address  these recommendations, which are aimed at addressing 
the safety issues examined in this report.  The NZ Transport Agency has various powers under 
the Railways Act 2005 to monitor and ensure  KiwiRail's  performance and compliance.  
The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take all 
appropriate steps to ensure that  KiwiRail addresses the above recommendations . (017/13)  

<< Page 32 >>
 Final Report  11-102 8.6.3.  On 11 October 2013, the NZ Transport Agen cy responded:  
Recommendations 013/13, 014/13, 015/13 and 016/13 that the Commission 
have directed to KiwiRail are noted.  Recommendation  017/13 made to the Chief 
Executive of the NZ Transport Agency is accepted.  Discussion on it will be initi ated 
on the publication of the final report.  These discussions will include a projected 
timeframe for implementation.  This will be advised to TAIC in due course.
