She had worked ""5 hours without a break or food"" and was managing a workload ""higher than usual"" (4.4.5). This fatigue likely impaired her cognitive functions, contributing significantly to the incident.
","0.0","15.0","The incident occurred because the train controller ""did not check the location of the coal train and mistakenly authorised the track engineer to on-track his alicart"" (4.1.1). This mistake was a direct result of human error and assumptions about the train's location.
","0.0","10.0","There was ""minimal training and education about detecting and managing stress and fatigue"" provided to the train controller (4.4.8). The lack of adequate training in these areas contributed to the train controller's inability to manage her stress and fatigue effectively.
","0.0","0.0","There is no specific mention in the document of issues related to training and familiarity with equipment contributing to the incident.
","0.0","5.0","The workplace culture ""did not encourage train controllers to ask for help"" (4.3.2), indicating a lack of effective crew resource management where support and teamwork could have mitigated the error.
","0.0","10.0","The train controller's action was ""contrary to standard protocol"" (4.1.1), and the lack of adherence to safety procedures directly led to the near-collision incident.
","0.0","10.0","The organizational culture at the time ""did not encourage train controllers to ask for help"" and expected them to ""sort out their own problems"" (4.3.2, 4.5.8), which contributed to the train controller not seeking assistance when overwhelmed.
","0.0","15.0","KiwiRail ""did not properly assess the implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section and the West Coast area during the daytime"" (5.3), and there was a lack of proper risk management strategies in place (4.2.8).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that regulatory oversight and compliance were factors in the incident.
","0.0","5.0","The train controller's situational awareness was likely compromised due to stress and mental fatigue (4.4.6), contributing to her failure to check the coal train's location.
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication in the document that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the incident.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not suggest that maintenance and inspection regimes were contributing factors to the incident.
","0.0","5.0","While not directly contributing to the incident, the ""single-line automatic signalling"" system increased the complexity of the train controller's job (4.8.1), and the lack of electronic visibility of trains in certain areas was a noted safety issue (4.8.5).
","0.0","0.0","Weather conditions are not mentioned as a contributing factor to the incident in the document.
","0.0","5.0","Although not explicitly stated as a communication breakdown, the train controller's failure to verify the coal train's location before authorizing the track engineer indicates a lapse in communication protocols (4.1.1).
