- name: Risk Management Approach to Assessing and Managing a Safety-Critical Function
  explanation: The theme of risk management approach to assessing and managing a safety-critical function is highly relevant to this accident as it highlights the failure to properly assess and manage the increased risks associated with merging the Otira/Rolleston section and the West Coast area during the daytime. The Commission found that "KiwiRail did not properly assess the implications of merging the Otira/Rolleston section and the West Coast area during the daytime" (5.3). This resulted in a higher-than-usual level of risk for train control because it required one train controller to manage two normally busy lines (5.2). The lack of a proper risk assessment and management strategy for this change in the normal roster was a significant oversight that contributed to the accident (5.4).
- name: Stress and Mental Fatigue
  explanation: Stress and mental fatigue is a critical safety theme in this accident as it directly impacted the train controller's performance. The train controller was found to be "stressed, mentally fatigued and operating well below an optimal level when she made her error" (5.6). The Commission noted that during the train controller's last hour of her shift, she dealt with a greater number of calls than usual, which contributed to her stress and fatigue (5.5). Furthermore, there was a lack of awareness within train control of the train controller's growing stress and mental fatigue, even though she was performing a safety-critical function with a higher-than-usual level of risk (5.7). This lack of awareness and support for managing stress and fatigue was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Supervision and Support
  explanation: Supervision and support, or the lack thereof, is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The train controller "received no support and minimal supervision during her 5-hour shift" despite the high demands of working a merged desk and the higher-than-usual level of risk associated with this arrangement (5.11). The absence of proper supervision meant that no one within train control was aware of the train controller's workload and her increasingly stressed state in the last hour of her shift (5.12). This lack of supervision and support contributed to the environment in which the train controller made the critical error.
- name: Rest Breaks and Workload Management
  explanation: The theme of rest breaks and workload management is relevant to this accident as the train controller was unable to take breaks during her shift due to her high workload. The Commission found that "train control protocols required train controllers to work their shifts without scheduled breaks" and that the train controller believed she could not leave her room during her 5-hour shift because of her high workload (4.6.1, 4.6.2). This resulted in her not having a rest, getting something to eat or drink, or going to the toilet during her shift, which was unsafe for her and those relying on her judgment (4.6.6, 4.6.7). The lack of scheduled breaks and the high workload without proper management of the risks associated with such an approach were significant safety issues.
- name: Planning and Coordination of Track Infrastructure Activity
  explanation: Poor planning and coordination of track infrastructure activities is a safety theme that exacerbated the complexity of the train controller's work on the day of the incident. The train controller had to deal with a high volume of routine and unplanned track infrastructure activities, which increased the complexity of her role and the likelihood of making mistakes (4.7.1, 4.7.2). The Commission noted that "the poor planning and co-ordination of these activities unnecessarily exacerbated the complexity of her work" (4.7.10 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The lack of proper processes to coordinate and manage track infrastructure activity was a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Visibility of Rail Vehicles on the Network
  explanation: The visibility of rail vehicles on the network is a safety theme that relates to the train controller's ability to monitor train movements. The Commission pointed out that "a large number of rail movements and track activities are not electronically visible to train control at any given time" (4.7). The Midland Line, including the Otira/Rolleston section, operates with single-line automatic signalling, which relies heavily on train controllers' memories and situational awareness (4.8.2, 4.8.3). The lack of electronic visibility increased the complexity of the train controller's job and the potential for error. Since the incident, KiwiRail has introduced a system to improve the electronic visibility of trains, which would have aided the train controller in this case (4.8.4, 4.8.5).
