  \  The evidence from the accident site revealed that the helicopter had suffered\
  \ an in -flight \nbreak -up.  The wreckage trail was consistent with the tail rotor\
  \ and another section of the tail \nboom having been severed  by successive strikes\
  \ of the main rotor bla des.  From that point the \nhelicopter was uncontrollable,\
  \ and the crash inevitable.  \n4.1.2.  The damage observed in components making\
  \ up the  main rotor blade assembly revealed that \nthe main rotor blades had flapped\
  \ to extreme up and down angles  against the physical stops \nand diverged from\
  \ their normal plane of rotation to strike  the tail boom7.   \n4.1.3.  No evidence\
  \ was found that a pre -existing mechanical condition contributed to the in -flight\
  \ \nbreak -up.  However, the high impact forces with the ground and resultant damage\
  \ t o the \nengine and its auxiliary components meant it was not possible to determine\
  \ with any certainty  \nhow well the engine had been  performing at the time of\
  \ the in -flight break -up.  The  possibility \nof an engine problem having contribut\
  \ ed to the accident could not therefore be excluded .  No \nevidence was found\
  \ of medical  or toxicological factors having contributed to the accident.  \n4.1.4.\
  \  Four  safety issues ar ose out of this inquiry:  \n1. The New Zealand regulatory\
  \ system has not  provide d sufficient mandatory requirements \nand guidance for\
  \ instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 \nhelicopters\
  \ to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilit ies.  \n2.\
  \ The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it\
  \ uses do \nnot draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and\
  \ conditions that could \nresult in serious injury or death.  \n3. The rate of R22\
  \ in -flight break -up accidents in New Zealand has not been reduced by the \nNew\
  \ Zealand version o f the FAA hazard mitigation measures intended to prevent such\
  \ \naccidents.  \n4. The crashworthiness of the ELT, which was designed to alert\
  \ and guide emergency \nservices to a crash site , was inadequate . \n4.2. What\
  \ happened  \nThe flight  \n4.2.1.  There was a  significant difference i n atmospheric\
  \ pressure between Wanaka on the e ast side \nof the Southern Alps and the West\
  \ Coast .  Wind will generally flow from  the higher -pressure \narea towards the\
  \ lower pressure8.  The general  wind direction on the day of the accident was \n\
  from east to west across  the Southern Alps.  This meant that the winds would  be\
  \ stronger \nacross the mountain saddles and passes than at lower levels.  A stronger\
  \ wind in mountainous \nterrain means more turbulence.  \n4.2.2.  Other local pilots\
  \ had noted the pressure differential a nd several also commented that actual \n\
  wind speeds were higher than those forecast.  \n4.2.3.  The strength of the actual\
  \ wind conditions high in the mountain passes was not immediately \nobvious from\
  \ the aeronautical  forecasts  or from the conditions at Wanaka  when the helicopter\
  \ \ndeparted .  The maximum forecast wind at 2000 feet was about 15 knots .  Nevertheless,\
  \ the \ninstructor was experienced in mountain flying in the area and he had told\
  \ the local helicopter \noperator at Neils  Beach that the winds were stronger than\
  \ he had expected for the outward \n                                           \
  \             \n7 This type of accident cause is called \"main rotor divergence\"\
  \ and \"loss of control\" in accordance with a \nstandard taxonomy.  \n8 \"Rule\
  \ of thumb\" - mountain flying training, and CAA publication \"VFR Met\"  (CAA -2,\
  \ 2010) .   \n \nFinal Report 11 -003 |\n<< Page 15 >>\n leg of the flight.  He\
  \ had also said that he was prepared to alter the return route if necessary.  \n\
  The instructor was  therefore expecting strong  wind and associated turbulence for\
  \ the return \nleg to Wanaka.  \n4.2.4.  The return leg from Neils  Beach began\
  \ with a diversion south to the Cascade River before \nintercepting the usual route\
  \ up the Arawhata River  and then up the Waipara River .  The reason \nfor this\
  \ diversion could not be established .  The subsequent track after this diversion\
  \ was a s \nexpected.  \n4.2.5.  The approach to  Matukituki Saddle was into the\
  \ wind.  The standard technique for crossing a \nmountain saddle from a blind valley\
  \ into the wind is to approach it on an angle from one side \nof the valley , thereby\
  \ providing for an escape path  away from the saddle  and back down the \nvalley\
  \ .  Ideally t he escape path should result in  the helicopter turning  away from\
  \ the terrain on \nthe selected  side of the valley and towards the direction from\
  \ which the wind  is coming , then  \nto fly  back down the sam e valley from where\
  \ it has come (CAA, 2006) .  The flight tracking \nrecord showed the helicopter\
  \ flying up the right -hand side of the Waipara River valley9.  This \nwas consistent\
  \ with the standard technique for  the wind  conditions  on the day .  From that\
  \ side \nof the valley the  escape route would have been to turn left across the\
  \ wind and reverse back \ndown the Waipara River  valley ( see Figure 1). \n4.2.6.\
  \  Instead the helicopter crossed Waipara Saddle to the right  (see Figure 7) .\
  \  It could not be \ndetermined with any certainty why this happened.  The flight\
  \ plan was to cross Matukituki \nSaddle , an area with which the instructor was\
  \ familiar,  and the pilots had reconfirmed this in \ntheir last radio position\
  \ report, onl y about 10 minutes before the accident.  \n4.2.7.  It is possible\
  \ that the helicopter was forced across Waipara Saddle by a strong wind spilling\
  \ \nover the saddle from the direction of Matukituki Saddle.  \n4.2.8.  Five other\
  \ helicopter pilots operating in the same area during th at same afternoon reported\
  \ \nstrong winds from the east, and severe turbulence.   \n4.2.9.  One pilot was\
  \ flying a Hughes 369 helicopter in the area.  He said that he passed over \nArawhata\
  \ Saddle (about 2 km from the accident site) about an hour after the accident. \
  \ He  \ndescribed the turbulence along his route as being \"pretty terrific\". \
  \ He participated in the \nsearch later in the day and experienced severe turbulence\
  \ near the south -eastern face of Bow \nPeak, near Waipara Saddle  where  the last\
  \ flight tracking position rep ort was recorded .  The \nturbulence was so severe\
  \ that it prevent ed him searching that area.  \n4.2.10.  Another  search pilot\
  \ flew a Eurocopter EC130 over Matukituki Saddle about 3 hours after the \naccident.\
  \  He found it too rough to remain in the area to the west of the  saddle , so he\
  \ flew \nover Waipara Saddle towards the last known position of the helicopter.\
  \  He estimated the wind \nacross Waipara Saddle into the Arawhata River basin to\
  \ be 30 knots and experienced very \nrough turbulence as he flew past Bow Peak.\
  \  \n \n                                                        \n9 In the direction\

  \  The tail rotor section and another section of the tail boom were found near the\
  \ start of the \nwreckage trail .  This is  almost certain ly a sign that the tail\
  \ boom was severed by the main rotor \nblades  and is  supported by the paint transfer\
  \ marks from the tail boom found on both main \nrotor blades, the impact impressions\
  \ on the tail boom and the fact that both main rotor blades \nwere bent  backwards\
  \ in the horizontal plane.   This rearward bending of the main rotor blades \nalso\
  \ supports a conclusion that the main rotor blades were being driven at the time\
  \ they \nstruck  the tail boom, meaning the engine was probably still delivering\
  \ power when the break -\nup seq uence began.  With t he loss of the tail boom and\
  \ rotor, the helicopter would have \nbecome instantly uncontrollable.  Figure 8\
  \ shows the angle at which the main rotor blades \nwould have div erged from the\
  \ main rotor plane in order to strike  the tail boom in this way.  \n4.2.12.  There\
  \ are several factors that can in combination cause main rotor divergence:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ low-gravity flight  \n\uF0B7 turbulence  \n\uF0B7 large , abrupt control movements\
  \  by the pilots  \n\uF0B7 low main rotor revolutions per minute ( RPM ). \n \n\
  Figure 8  \nThe tail boom impact lines  \nLow-gravity flight  \n4.2.13.  Low-gravity\
  \ flight is a situation when  the occupants feel a sensation of weightlessness.\
  \  It can \nbe induced by the pilot performing a climb then suddenly push ing over\
  \ into a dive or level \nflight .  One possible result  of low -gravity  flight\
  \ accidents  is mast bumping10, and if the main \n                             \
  \                           \n10 Mast bumping is where the main rotor blades flap\
  \ beyond their normal limits and the blade spindles bump \nagainst  the main rotor\
  \ shaft ( mast ).   \n\n \n \n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report 11 -003 rotor blades\
  \ strike the airframe, this is typically on the left side of the cabin11.  This\
  \ did not \nhappen in  this case.  Also, an examination of the mast under the crushed\
  \ teeter stops showed \nthat the mast bumping had not been severe enough to damage\
  \ the mast.  The evidence of \nmast bumping was limited to the teeter stops only\
  \ .  For these reasons , low-gravity fli ght was \nunlikely to have been the main\
  \ factor contributing to the main rotor divergence.  However, the \npossibility\
  \ that it was a contributing factor due to turbulence cannot be excluded.  \nTurbulence\
  \  \n4.2.14.  Turbulence is graded as light, moderate, severe or extreme. Light\
  \ turbulence is when the \nturbulence causes slight erratic changes in attitude\
  \ or altitude. At the other end of the scale, \nextreme turbulence is capable of\
  \ structural damage.  The grading is  subjective and related to \nthe weight of\
  \ the aircraft .  A pilot of a light helicopter may regard turbulence as moderate\
  \ but a \npilot in a commercial airliner may regard the same turbulence as light.\
  \   \n4.2.15.  Flying in turbulence is a known contributor to  main rotor divergence.\
  \  A large gust downwards \nthrough the rot or disc can lead to unloading of the\
  \ rotor blades, which can result in low -gravity \nflight.  A large gust upward\
  \ would load the rotor blades and increase the blade angle of \nattack11.  Either\
  \ situation can be exacerbated if the pilot responds by over -controlling the \n\
  helicopter  in the turbulence, which can result in excessive blade flapping and\
  \ lead to main \nrotor divergence.  The helicopter was highly likely to have been\
  \ in severe  or extreme  \nturbulence soon after crossing Waipara Saddle.  Turbulence\
  \ was likely to have been one of the \nmain factors contributing to the in -flight\
  \ break -up. \nLarge , abrupt control inputs  \n4.2.16.  The R22 is very responsive\
  \ to pilot movements on the controls , especially the cyclic control,  \nand requires\
  \ only light forces to achieve full control movement. A pilot who makes several\
  \ \nconsecutive large and abrupt control movement s in either pitch or roll may\
  \ cause the main \nrotor blades to f lap excessively , which may  lead to main rotor\
  \ divergence .  Pilot control \nmovements may be accentuated in turbulence  if the\
  \ pilot tries to overcompensate for the \nexternal buffeting.  The NTSB  concluded\
  \ in a study that \"large  and abrupt control inputs by the  \npilot can lead directly\
  \ to mast bumping or induce blade stall, which in turn can lead to mast \nbumping\"\
  \ (NTSB, 1996) . \n4.2.17.  It could not be determined which of  the instructor\
  \ or student  pilot was flying the helicopter at \nthe time of the in -flight break\
  \ -up.  The instructor had more experience flying the R22 \nhelicopter so was likely\
  \ to have been more capable in turbulent weather conditions than the \nstudent .\
  \  If the student  was flying the helicopter at the time, it is possible that over\
  \ -controlling \nthe helicopter could have occurred before the instructor had time\
  \ to take over or limit the \namount of control deflection in response to turbulence.\
  \  The  issue of regulatory requir ements \nin New Zealand that govern when a pilot\
  \ is allowed to manipulate the controls in R22 \nhelicopters is discussed later\
  \ in this report.  \nLow main rotor revolutions per minute  \n4.2.18.  In normal\
  \ flight the lift generated by the main rotor blades supports the weigh t of the\
  \ \nhelicopter.  The centrifugal force applied to the main rotor  blades from the\
  \ speed of rotation \nbalances  the lift they also generate and prevents them bending\
  \ upwards  too far .  If the \nrotational speed of the main rotor is allowed to\
  \ reduce  below th e lower limit , the reduction in \ncentrifugal force will no\
  \ longer balance the lift , which will  allow the blades to  flap up \nexcessively\
  \ .   \n4.2.19.  A second ary effect of  low rotor RPM  is \"rotor stall \". This\
  \ is when the angle of airflow across the \nrotor blade exceeds a critical value\
  \  and the blade is no longer able to generate lift.  Main rotor \nstall is unlikely\
  \ to occur symmetrically, which can lead to main rotor divergence and the blades\
  \ \nstriking the airframe.  \n                                                 \
  \       \n11 Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB, United Kingdom ) Bulletin\
  \ 2/2013, G -CHZN.  \n \nFinal Report 11 -003 |\n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.2.20.  Engine\
  \ failure or a partial loss of engine power may also cause a low rotor RPM  situation\
  \ if the \npilot does not take appropriate action  in time to maintain rotor RPM\
  \ .  A further  cause can be  \nwhen  a pilot makes an excessive  or abrupt upward\
  \ movement  on the collective  control. This \ncould cause  the main rotor blades\
  \ to over -pitch , and the  resulting aerodynamic  drag on the \nblades may exceed\
  \ the available engine power.  This is more likely to occur at higher altitude \n\
  or when the helicopter is heavier , as was the case in this accident, because in\
  \ these \nconditions the rotor blades are already operating at high pitch angles\
  \  to generate the required \nthrust to keep the helicopter in the air . \n4.2.21.\
  \  The R22 at maximum fuel capacity has about 3 hours ' flying  endurance.  However,\
  \ with 2 \naverage -weight12 pilots it can only carry sufficient fuel for  about\
  \ 2 hours ' endurance  without \nexceeding the maximum permissible loading .  The\
  \ operator's practice at Wanaka was to fill \nboth helicopter tanks partially ,\
  \ up to the hose nozzle ( two-thirds  capacity or about 70 litres) for \ndual cross\
  \ -country flights, giving about 2 hours ' flight duration.  The fuel taken on at\
  \ Wanaka \nbefore the flight was from an unmetered bulk tank.  After flying to Neils\
  \  Beach  the pilots  added  \nanother 40 litres of fuel ( equivalent to one to\
  \ 1.5 hours ' flying time) . \n4.2.22.  Assuming that the operator's standard practice\
  \ had been followed, a t the time of the accident \nthe helicopter would  have had\
  \ sufficient fuel remaining for about  1.5 hours of flying .  In this \ncase it\
  \ would have been just under the maximum permissible weight . \n4.2.23.  An inspection\
  \ of the maintenance records for the helicopter revealed nothing of concern.  The\
  \ \nevidence indicate d that the engine was delivering some power when the main\
  \ rotor blades  \nstruck the tail boom.  However, the damage  to the engine and\
  \ components caused by the \nground impact precluded any meaningful post -accident\
  \ performance testing of the engine.  \nTherefore the possibility of a partial drop\
  \ in engine performance contributing t o main rotor \nRPM  decay could not be excluded.\
  \  \nLikely sequence of events  \n4.2.24.  The helicopte r was flying above 5000\
  \ feet to cross  Matukitu ki Saddle  and it was close to its \nmaximum permissible\
  \ weight.  It was therefore flying in conditions of reduced power margin .  It \n\
  was also flying into an area of moderate  to extreme  turbulence.  The helicopter\
  \ manufacturer \nrecommended that  strong winds or turbulence  be avoided .  Pilots\
  \ who inadvertently encounter \nturbulence are recommended to maintain an average\
  \ indicated airspeed of between 60 and \n70 knots .  They are also warned against\
  \ over -controlling the helicopter in response to \nturbulence13. \n4.2.25.  As\
  \ previously mentioned, it could not be established which of the pilots was manipulating\
  \ the \ncontrols , but they would have exper ienced some degree of turbulence during\
  \ the flight that \nday.  If the student pilot with less R22 flying experience14\
  \  was manipulating  the controls , the \nrisk of over -controlling the helicopter\
  \ in response to turbulence was higher15.  However, the \nlast record ed position\
  \ of the helicopter and the wreckage trail show ed that after deviating \nfrom the\
  \ planned route and crossing Waipara Saddle , the helicopter travelled about one\
  \ \nkilometre  before the in -flight break -up began.  If the instructor had had\
  \ any concern s about \nthe student 's capability in turbulence there  should have\
  \ been  ample time to take back the \ncontrols when they started to deviate from\
  \ the planned route . \n4.2.26.  The risk of an in -flight break -up from a main\
  \ rotor blade divergence event was high a s the \nhelico pter approach ed Matukituki\
  \ Saddle .  It was high  due to the helicopter being near \nmaximum weight  and\
  \ at a relatively high altitude, the strong wind , and flying in moderate  to \n\
  extreme  turbulence.  The se conditions were challenging even for an experienced\
  \  R22 pilot \nbecause t hey could  in combination cause main rotor blade divergence\
  \ , particularly if the pilot \n                                               \
  \         \n12 The operator used a standard weight allowance for an adult of 83\
  \ kilograms.  \n13 Robinson Helicopter Company safety notice issued in 1998 (SN\
  \ -32). \n14 This refers to the experience threshold flight hours set by the FAA\
  \ in Special Fe deral Aviation Regulation  73 \n(Appendix 6) . \n15 The R22 is more\
  \ responsive than other helicopters and special training is required (NTSB/SIR -96/03\
  \ \nfinding s 5 and 7, \n<< page 29 >>\n) . \n \n \n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report\
  \ 11 -003 responded with excessive movements of the cyclic control  or an abrupt\
  \ upward movement on \nthe collective control . \n4.2.27.  The following e vidence\
  \ from the wreckage show ed that the in-flight break -up was caused by \nmain rotor\
  \ divergence : \n\uF0B7 the main rotor blades had flapped  up and down to the limit\
  \ stops and the \nblades had flexed beyond their normal flexible range , causing\
  \  permanent \ncreases on the upper and lower  surfaces  \n\uF0B7 the main rotor\
  \ hub had teetered beyond the design limit  and crushed both \nteeter stops (mast\
  \ bump)  \n\uF0B7 the 2 pitch links  had snapped under tension at the blade pitch\
  \ horn  ends  and \nthe drive link had snapped at the swashplate  end \n\uF0B7 both\
  \ main rotor blades had struck  and separated the tail boom . \n4.2.28.  The flight\
  \ up the Waipar a River valley was consistent with the civil aviation guidelines\
  \ for \napproaching and crossing mountain saddles.  If something started to go wrong,\
  \ the typical \nescape path sho uld have been a left turn across the wind and a\
  \ head ing back down the river \nvalley.  Instead the helicopter trave lled right\
  \ , over Waipar a Saddle and into an area of \ndescending air and turbulence.  This\
  \ unexpected  diversion from the intended route for the \nhelicopter was unlikely\
  \ to have been deliberate.  The helicopter was possibly forced across \nWaipara\
  \ S addle by a strong cross -wind  as it gained height  to clear Matukituki Saddle\
  \ , and the \npilots possibly decided that the safer option was to turn with the\
  \ win d and escape down the \nArawhata R iver valley instead.  \nFindings:  \n1.\
  \ The helicopter was operating in conditions of reduced power margin  where it was\
  \ near \nto the maximum allowable weight, and flying at relatively high altitude\
  \ in strong wind \nand moderate to extre me turbulence , at the time it broke up\
  \ in flight.  \n2. The cause of the in -flight break -up was main rotor blade divergence\
  \ caused by a \npossible combination of the following factors:  \n\uF0B7 the helicopter\
  \ entering low -gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of tur bulence)  \n\
  \uF0B7 turbulence  \n\uF0B7 excessive  movements  of the cyclic control  \n\uF0B7\
  \ low main rotor blade RPM .  \n3. There was no evidence found that mechanical failure\
  \ initiated the in -flight break -up, but \nthe major damage to the engine and other\
  \ components meant that the possibili ty of this \ncould not be excluded.  \n \n\
  4.3. History  of the R22 helicopter  \n4.3.1.  The circumstances of this in -flight\
  \ break -up accident were not dissimilar to others  involving  \nR22 helicopters.\
  \  The FAA first certified the R22  in 1979.  In the following 15 years  there were\
  \  \na number  of fatal R22 crashes around the world , where helicopter s had broke\
  \ n up in flight.  \nOften the investigations were inconclusive or found  no apparent\
  \ cause s, but there were some \ncommon failure modes .  Either t he main rotor\
  \ had diverge d from its norm al plane to strike  the \ntail boom or cockpit , or\
  \ the drive shaft had severed , allowing the main rotor to detach  \ncompletely\
  \  from the helicopter . \n \nFinal Report 11 -003 |\n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.3.2.  These\
  \ accidents prompted the FAA to conduct  3 Special Certification Reviews o f the\
  \ R22 in \n1982, 1988 and 1994 .  The purpose of these reviews was  to check that\
  \ the helicopter  \ncomplied with the certification requirements16.  The review\
  \ teams initiate d some changes and \nraised some concerns.  They expressed doubt\
  \ about the validity of the FAA certification \nrequirements f or small helicopters\
  \  and considered that the one-second pilot response time17 \nto certain events\
  \ was too short , particularly for an aircraft  used for training .  Further research\
  \ \nwas recommended18. \n4.3.3.  A further  review by the FAA Flight Standardization\
  \ Board in 1995 , convened to consider \ntraining requirements for R22 pilots ,\
  \ reported (FAA FSB, 1995) : \nThe Robinson R -22 has characteristics which makes\
  \ awareness of certain \naerodynamic factors mandatory.  The awareness of low \"\
  G\" operatio ns, rotor \nblade stall potential, energy management, and low rotor\
  \ RPM recovery \ntechniques are critical.  \n4.3.4.  This review report set out\
  \ training and currency requirements for R22 pilots and instructors \nand suggested\
  \ design changes deemed necessary for ensuring the safe operation of the R22.  \
  \ \nThe report recommended  that the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR)  Part 27\
  \ be reviewed with \nregard to main rotor inertia in single -engine helicopters\
  \ .  \n4.3.5.  The NTSB w as also concerned with the safety of the R22 .  Its concern\
  \ was prompted by  \nanother fatal accident in 1992.  The  damage characteristics\
  \ were similar to other main rotor \nblade divergence accidents .  The pilot  was\
  \ an experienced R22 pilot  and the accident \noccurred in apparently benign circumstances\
  \ .  The NTSB launched a special investigation \n(NTSB, 1996) .  The investigation\
  \ researched 34  similar accidents involving R22 and  R44 \nhelicopters.  \n4.3.6.\
  \  During the 4 -year investigation, the NTSB issued 11 safety recommendations to\
  \ the FAA.   \nSome of these initial safety recommendations required immediate action\
  \ and other \nrecommendations called  for further testing to gain a better understanding\
  \ of  the rotor system  \ndynamics .  All 11 safety recommendations had been closed\
  \ by the time the NTSB r eport was \npublished in 1996.  The NTSB considered that\
  \ the safety actions implemented by the FAA up \nto the date the report was  published\
  \ had been effective in reducing accidents of this type.  \n4.3.7.  The NTSB report\
  \ concluded that the R22 was more  responsive than other light helicopters to \n\
  pilots ' cyclic control inputs and that the cause of many of the \"loss of main\
  \ rotor control \" \naccidents  likely  stemmed from pilots making large and abrupt\
  \ control movements .  The NTSB \nconsidered  that the low -inertia rotor could\
  \ diverge from the normal rotation plane and strike \nthe fuselage within 0.5 seconds\
  \ , so flight instructors would not have sufficient time to react to \nlarge or\
  \ abrupt control movements by trainee s unless they were actually holding the cyclic\
  \ \ncontrol s19.  \n4.3.8.  The NTSB acknowledged the numerous operational changes\
  \ implemented by the FAA to \nensure that R22 pilots were more knowledgeable about\
  \  specific R22 hazards and were better \ntrained , and that flights in adverse\
  \ weather conditions by inexperienced pilots were limit ed.  \nAccident data since\
  \ the changes had been implemented in 1995 suggested to the NTSB at \nthe time that\
  \ the corrective actions should help to prevent such accidents19.    \n4.3.9.  In\
  \ 1996 the NTSB issued 6 new safety recom mendations with the final report.  The\
  \ first \nrecommendation  was to make the FAA's requirement for R22 pilots to undergo\
  \ special safety \nawareness training permanent (see the section below on \"Special\
  \ safety awareness training \") \nand the rest were for further research and the\
  \ requirement fo r light helicopter manufacturers \n                           \
  \                             \n16 Code of Federal Regulation 14 CFR Part 27.  \n\
  17 Part of the helicopter certification tests to CFR Part 27 requires that for one\
  \ condition, the minimum time \ndelay for corrective action may be one second or\
  \ the pilot reaction time, whichever is greater .  For other test \nconditions \
  \ the pilot reaction time  is accepted . No value is defined for pilot reaction\
  \ time.   \n18 These facts are described in NTSB, 1996.  \n19 \n<< Page 27 >>\n\
  \ of the NTSB report, 1996.  \n \n \n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report 11 -003 to provide\
  \ standard information about control sensitivity. The NTSB closed the last of these\
  \ 6 \nsafety recommendations on 17 March 2010.  \n4.3.10.  Improvements were made\
  \ to the helicopter throttle governor and low rotor RPM warning \nsystem , but o\
  \ ther issues could  not be resolved with simple modifications. The FAA and the\
  \ \nNTSB still held  concern s about the following residual safety issues : \n1.\
  \ Low rotor RPM  - The very short time a pilot had in the R22 to respond if the\
  \ main rotor \nRPM  reduced  below the normal acceptable range.  This short response\
  \ time was also the \nfocus  of concern with the airworthiness standards  noted\
  \ in separate FAA reviews .  \n2. Mast bumping  - When the main rotor plane is tilted\
  \ in relation  to the mast drive shaft \nbeyon d its physical limits , and the blade\
  \ spindles contact  the mast at each revolution.  \nWithin a few revolutions , one\
  \ or both of the main rotor  blades  could  either completely or \npartially separate\
  \ from the rest of the helicopter . \n3. Main rotor divergence and loss  of control\
  \  - Situations where the R22 main rotor could \ndiverge from its normal plane \
  \ of rotation and strike  either  the cockpit or the tail boom.   \nThe public records\
  \ from the NTSB and the FAA show that they could not determine the \nroot cause\
  \ of main rotor divergence and it was too risky to conduct flight experiments. \
  \ A \nmathematical model to simulate and study the condition was  also abandoned.\
  \   \n4. Low-gravity condition  - The helicopter is flown in a manner that makes\
  \ the crew \nexperience a feeling of weightlessness .  Under low -gravity situations\
  \ the R22 can roll \nunexpectedly to the right , but the pilot's response on the\
  \ control s, according to the flight \nmanual , must be with an aft cyclic  movement\
  \ rather than the more intuitive left cyclic  to \ncounter the roll .  An intuitive\
  \ response by the pilot could rapidly develop into a mast \nbump.  The flight manual\
  \  \"cautions \" pilots that under no circumstances may this \nmanoeuvre be  demonstrated\
  \ or  practised in flight20.  The manoeuvre is prohibited in the \n\"Limitations\
  \ \" section  of the manual . \nSpecial safety awareness training  \n4.3.11.  The\
  \ FAA decided to address the residual concerns aris ing from the 3 Special Certification\
  \ \nReviews and the NTSB special investigation by mandating special  safety  awareness\
  \ training \nfor pilots and placing operating restrictions when the R22 helicopter\
  \ s were  flown by  \ninexperienced pilots.   The FAA was also concerned that the\
  \ R44  helicopter  had similar \ncharacteristics to the R22.   The FAA considered\
  \ these issues so critical that its response in \n1995 was to mandate special safety\
  \ awareness training for all R22 and R44 pilots before they \ncould conduct their\
  \ nex t flight s.  The requirement was described in Special Federal Aviation \n\
  Regulation 73 (SFAR 73) , which also set a threshold for minimum pilot experience.\
  \  Pilots with \nless than the minimum experience would be subject to additional\
  \ flight restrictions describ ed \nin SFAR 73  (see Appendix 6: The current version\
  \ of SFAR 73 ). \n4.3.12.  Airworthiness directives (ADs) were  issued at the time\
  \ to set limits for inexperienced R22  and \nR44 pilots.  They were not allowed\
  \ to fly the helicopter s when winds were a bove a set range or \nin conditions\
  \ of moderate or worse turbulence.  \n4.3.13.  Initially SFAR 73 was temporary and\
  \ the AD s were permanent .  The status has changed over \nthe years to SFAR 73\
  \ being made permanent on 29 June 2009 , and remaining applicable to \nboth the\
  \ R22 and R44 helicopters.  The AD s setting limits for inexperienced pilots remained\
  \  \npermanent for the R22 , but were  rescinded for the R44  because the FAA determined\
  \ that it \nwas no longer necessary to correct an unsafe condition .   \n4.3.14.\
  \  The FAA introduction paragraph in the \"Normal Procedures \" section of the flight\
  \ manual  stated \n(FAA, 1996)  : \n                                           \
  \             \n20 This change was made with airworthiness directives AD 95 -11-09\
  \ for the R22 and AD 95 -11-10 for the \nR44.  \n \nFinal Report 11 -003 |\n<< Page\
  \ 23 >>\n Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions and aircraft\
  \ \ncharacteristics that lead to main rotor blade/fusela ge contact accidents, and\
  \ \ncorrective type design changes and operating limitations are identified, Model\
  \ \nR22 pilots are strongly urged to become familiar with the following information\
  \ \nand comply with these recommended procedures:  \n[The insert ed text went o\
  \ n to describe  main rotor stall and mast bumping \nsituations and preventive techniques\
  \ including a recommended, across -the-\nboard limit of  maximum speed to 0.9  Vne\
  \ (velocity to never exceed). ] \nNew Zealand response  \nSafety issue  - The New\
  \ Zealand regulatory oversight provide d insufficient guidance and \nmandatory requirements\
  \ for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and \nR44 helicopters\
  \ to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilit ies. \n4.3.15.\
  \  The R22 helicopter type certificat e (H10WE)  prescribe d the conditions and\
  \ limitations for the \nhelicopter to meet  the airworthiness requirements21.  The\
  \ FAA-approved flight manual  form ed \npart of the type approval certificate .\
  \  Any subsequent changes the FAA made to the  mandatory \nsections of the flight\
  \ manual  (sections  2 - Limitations, 3  - Emergency Procedures , 4 - Normal \n\
  Procedures and 5  - Performance) had to  be adopted by the  aviation authorities\
  \  in other \ncountries .  If they were not adopted, the helicopter would not b\
  \ e considered  airworthy  in that \ncountry . \n4.3.16.  When the R22 was first\
  \ imported  to New Zealand , the CAA  accepted the foreign type \ncertificate from\
  \ the FAA, which is  now listed under Advisory Circular AC21 -1 Append ix 2.  This\
  \ \naction made the FAA -approved flight manual  valid in New Zealand and obliged\
  \ the CAA to \nadopt any future changes to the flight manual  in order  to retain\
  \ compliance with the type \ncertificate . \n4.3.17.  The FAA made a number of changes\
  \ to the conditions for the R22 helicopter through its SFAR \n73 and ADs.  New Zealand\
  \ broadly adopted these various changes through the equivalent \ninstruments (see\
  \ Appendix 5: History of airworthiness directives  and SFAR 73 in N ew Zealand \
  \ \nfor detail s of these historical changes ).  The U SA and New Zealand conditions\
  \ for operating \nthe R22 helicopter were broadly the same until 1998.  \n4.3.18.\
  \  Post 1998 t here were 2 fundamental differences between how the FAA and the CAA\
  \ regulated \nthe special training and flight limitations for R22  and R44 pilots:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the FAA prohibited  inexperienced22 pilots from flying (manipulating\
  \ the controls  of) R22 \nhelicopter s once wind speed and t urbulence reached certain\
  \ levels, whereas the CAA \nallowed inexperienced pilots to fly the helicopter s\
  \ in those conditions provided the pilot s-\nin-comma nd (instructor s) were  experienced\
  \  \n\uF0B7 in the U SA, R22 helicopter instructors had to be especially approved\
  \ and endorsed by the \nFAA as being suitable to instruct on the helicopter, whereas\
  \ in New Zealand there was no \nspecial requirement  other than that they must have\
  \ completed the Robinson safety \nawareness training . \nThe pilot-flying  \n4.3.19.\
  \  Given the 0.5 -second time it cou ld take for a main rotor divergence to occur,\
  \ the FAA was \nconcerned that an instructor might not have time to prevent a trainee\
  \  pilot over-controlling the \nhelicopter in response to turbulence.  To address\
  \ this risk the FAA  prohibited  inexperienced \npilots f rom manipulating the controls\
  \ in turbulent  and windy conditions.  In New Zealand the \nrestrictions were changed\
  \ to apply  only to the pilot -in-command's experience, irrespective of \nwho was\
  \ manipulating the controls. (See Appendix 1 for more details .) \n            \
  \                                            \n21 Code of Federal Regulation 14\
  \ CFR Part 27 and specified amendment status.  \n22 The threshold between inexperienced\
  \ and experienced was determined from accident data and is \ndescribed in Appendix\
  \ 4 . \n \n \n<< Page 24 >>\n Final Report 11 -003 4.3.20.  The New Zealand situation\
  \ did not therefore address the FAA's concern about reaction time.  \nAn instructor\
  \ can \"guard \" the cyclic control against over -controlling  by the trainee ,\
  \ but this can \nbe challenging  because of the cyclic control desig n.  The cyclic\
  \ control is pivoted on a central \npedestal between the  pilots.  The pilot who\
  \ is flying pull s their control handle down to a natural \nand comfortable flying\
  \ position , which raises the other pilot's handle.  Robinson recommends \nthat\
  \ in turbulenc e the pilot steady  their right arm against their thigh .  This has\
  \ the effect of \nfurther raising the cyclic control for the non -flying pilot \
  \ and, depending on the height of the \npilot flying, putting it beyond comfortable\
  \ reach (Figure 9). \n4.3.21.  The FAA prevent s inexperienced R22/R44 pilots acting\
  \ as pilot s-in-command until they me et \nthe minimum flight  experience.  It also\
  \ provide s for an alternative path if their log book s are \nappropri ately endorsed\
  \ and they undergo  annual flight reviews until they meet the minimum \nlevel of\
  \ experience.  In New Zealand, R22/R44 pilots with less than the FAA minimum \n\
  experience are not limited f rom acting as pilot s-in-command.  \n4.3.22.  The FAA\
  \ ha s set minimum flying time s under dual instruction  for trainee helicopter\
  \ pilots \nwishing to convert to the R22 when they have only fixed -wing flying\
  \ time s, or ratings on other \nhelicopter types .  In New Zealand these either\
  \ do not apply or are set at a lower limit . \n4.3.23.  The FA A requires that all\
  \ Flight Reviews for pilots wishing to maintain R22 or R44 ratings be \ncarried\
  \ out in the relevant R22 or R44 helicopter s and only with approved R22 or R44\
  \ \ninstructor s.  This is to ensure that their safety awareness knowledge and skills\
  \ ar e also \ncurrent.  This requirement does not apply in New Zealand.  \nThe i\
  \ nstructors  \n4.3.24.  Instructor training  in the U SA has a separate line of\
  \ quality control back to the FAA .  This has \nbeen  done  to ensure that safety\
  \ awareness training is delivered in a consisten t manner , by \ninstructors who\
  \ have  demonstrated thorough knowledge of the R22 handling characteristics , \n\
  and demonstrated they have the  skills to pass  this on through their instructional\
  \ techniques.   \nIn New Zealand any category of helicopter instructor may provide\
  \ the required safety \nawareness training for the R22 without any overall national\
  \ quality control or oversight.  \n4.3.25.  The Commission interviewed several experienced\
  \ R22 instructors from New Zealand.  The \nCommission also  convened  an industry\
  \ fact -finding panel discussion with a selected group of \nthe most experienced\
  \ R22 instructors in New Zealand .  The discussion revealed:  \n\uF0B7 diversity\
  \ in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and limitations\
  \  \n\uF0B7 diversity in instructors' understanding of the theory behind the Robinson\
  \ safety \nawareness training  \nFigure 9  \nR22 cyclic control  \n \nFinal Report\
  \ 11 -003 |\n<< Page 25 >>\n \uF0B7 that t here was no national , standard training\
  \ syllabus  for safety awareness training that \ninstructors could  follow . \n\
  4.3.26.  These findings are a serious  safety issue .  They show that safety awareness\
  \ training and \nlessons from fatal accidents  caused by pilots exceeding the  limitations\
  \ of the R22 helicopter \nhave not been well conveyed to New Zealand's most experienced\
  \ R22 helicopter instructor \npilots.  The flow-on effect s to trainee  pilots,\
  \ of whom some will be New Zealand's future \ninstructors, mean s that the situation\
  \ could get worse unless the CAA intervenes.   The \nCommission has recommended\
  \ that the CAA address this safety issue . \n4.3.27.  Wanaka Helicopters held op\
  \ erational certificates under 3 parts of the Civil Aviation  Rules: Part \n119\
  \ - Air Operator ; Part 135 - Air Operations, Helicopter and Small Aircraft; and\
  \ Part 141 - \nAviation Training Organisations. The CAA carried out regular audits\
  \ for compliance with each  of \nthese parts.  \n4.3.28.  The operator had also\
  \ developed its training systems to meet the New Zealand Qualifications \nAuthority\
  \ 's qualifications framework and was separately audited for compliance against\
  \ its \nrequirements.  \n4.3.29.  The operator had systems in place to train  new\
  \ pilots and review trainee s' progress amongst \nthe instructor team. The CAA audits\
  \ for the previous  2 years had not revealed any concerns \nand the New Zealand\
  \ Qualifications Authority 's audit had commented favourably on the \ntraining systems\
  \ and facilitie s in place.  No issues had been  found with the operator's \nmanagement\
  \ or operating systems.  \n4.3.30.  The question then arises, why did the instructor\
  \ on this occasion allow the helicopter  to enter \nan area of predictably  strong\
  \  turbulence at high altitude and with th e helicopter close to its \nmaximum permissible\
  \ weight?  \n4.3.31.  The instructor may have been approaching Matukituki Saddle\
  \ to test the weather conditions \nwith the intention of \"escaping \" if they proved\
  \ untenable.  He may have simply been caught \nunaware s by the ferocity of the\
  \ wind and turbulence as he approached Waipara Saddle .  An \ninstructor who fully\
  \ understood the limitations of the R22 helicopter and who knew of the \nconditions\
  \ ahead would have been less likely to attempt  this manoeuvre.   \nFindings:  \n\
  4. The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and\
  \ unsafe \nit was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum  weight\
  \ , and in \nconditions of moderate  to extreme  turbulence.  \n5. The New Zealand\
  \ regulatory over sight provide d insufficient guidance and mandatory \nrequirements\
  \ for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 \nhelicopters\
  \ to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations . \n \nFlight\
  \ manual (clarity of safety -critical information)  \nSafety issue - The format\
  \ of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual  and the terminology it \nuses do\
  \ not draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and conditions\
  \ that could \nresult in serious injury or death.  \n4.3.32.  The flight manual\
  \ contains the manufacturer's description of the helicopter 's performance, \nlimitations,\
  \ emergency procedures and systems.  It forms part of the type certification \n\
  requirements and must be carried with the helicopter at all times.  This docu ment\
  \ guides \npilots on how to handle the helicopter safely and keep within the flight\
  \ limitations defined by \nthe manufacturer.  \n4.3.33.  The \"Limitations \" section\
  \ of the R22 flight manual is approved by the FAA to ensure a \nminimum standard\
  \ .  The  other sections , such as the \"Safety Notices \" section , are provided\
  \ by \n \n \n<< Page 26 >>\n Final Report 11 -003 the manufacturer for the benefit\
  \ of pilots, owners and operators.  Some inconsistencies have \nevolved with the\
  \ R22 flight manual over time as it has been amended  by the manufacturer , by \n\
  the FAA  and, in New Ze aland's case, by the CAA.  \n4.3.34.  Robinson Helicopter\
  \  Company  has developed a number of safety notices to assist pilots and \nwarn\
  \ them about identified hazards and safety -critical situations to be avoided. \
  \ Some of \nthese safety -critical situations have been carried  forward to the\
  \ mandatory \"Limitations \" \nsection of the manual  - the section to which  all\
  \ pilots must adhere.  However , others have not.  \n4.3.35.  Robinson Helicopter\
  \ Company has produced  safety notices (see Appendix 7: Relevant \nRobinson Helicopter\
  \ Company R22 safety ) that explain the hazards of, and how to manage : \n\uF0B7\
  \ low-gravity manoeuvres (SN -11) \n\uF0B7 low-RPM main rotor stall (SN -24) \n\uF0B7\
  \ high winds and turbulence (SN-32). \n4.3.36.  The FAA's AD 95 -26-04, made in\
  \ 1995 , limited the helicopter to 70%  of the maximum \nallowable airspeed (0.7\
  \ of Vne or about 71 knots) when turbulence was encountered23.  The \nR22 flight\
  \ manual has been revised several times since 1995 , but by 2011 the \"Limitations\
  \ \" \nsection of the flight manual still did not mention any airspeed limit for\
  \ the helicopter in \nturbulent and windy conditions .  Given the R22's susceptibility\
  \ to in-flight break -ups from main \nrotor divergence in turbulent conditions,\
  \ this matter should have been highlighted in the \nmandatory \"Limitations \" section\
  \ of the ma nual.  Given that the pilots of small aircraft rarely \ncheck the content\
  \ of a flight manual when flying, it would be a useful prompt for pilots to have\
  \ \nthis limitation marked on the airspeed indicator or prominently placarded in\
  \ the cockpit.  \n4.3.37.  Another safety issue arises over how Warnings, Cautions\
  \ and Notes are referred to in the \nRobinson flight manual.  The FAA provide s\
  \ an advisory circular for manufacturers that \ndescribes an acceptable means of\
  \ compliance for the content and structure of the flight \nmanual i n order to meet\
  \ certification requirements24. \n4.3.38.  The advisory circular states that, \"\
  Warnings  should be used with respect to safety matters that \nare immediately imminent\
  \ \" and that \"Cautions  should be used  for safety matters that are not \nimminent\
  \ \".  Notes  refer  to important information that does not fit with in either of\
  \ the other  2 \ndescriptions . These definition s are generally interpreted by\
  \ aircraft manufacturers to mean \nthat non -compliance with a Warning  could cause\
  \ death or serious injury and non-compliance \nwith a Caution  could cause damage\
  \ to the aircraft.  \n4.3.39.  The Robinson flight manual does not use the term\
  \ \"Warning \".  The term  \"Caution \" is us ed to \ndescribe actions that are\
  \ likely to prove fatal  or cause damage to the helicopter.  Although \nthese terms\
  \ did not have the more commonly accepted industry interpretation s, they were not\
  \ \nspecifically defined in the manual until 2012 . For example the \"Flight and\
  \ manoeuvre \nlimitations \"25 section of the manual has a \"Caution \" at the top\
  \ about low \"G\" conditions that it \nstates, \"... can result in catastrophic\
  \ loss of lateral control\".  This would normally be described \nas a \"Warning\
  \ \" under the FAA guidelines because if the caution is not followed, a loss of\
  \ \nlateral control would be immediately imminent and highly likely resul t in a\
  \ fatal accident . \n4.3.40.  According to the CAA's aeronautical information publication\
  \ , about 60% of New Zealand is  \ndesignated as mountainous terrain, including\
  \ most of the South Island.  Wind blowing across \nmountainous areas results in\
  \  turbulence  as it  is channelled through or over the terrain , \ncausing sudden\
  \ changes in wind speed and directio n.  R22 instructors and trainee pilots \nshould\
  \ be absolutely clear in their understanding of how hazardous it is to operate R22\
  \ \nhelicopter s in moderate to extreme  turbulence.  It is possible that the significance\
  \ of this \n                                                        \n23 The operator\
  \ advised that this lower speed was related to the desire d lower power setting\
  \ , which would \nhave reduce d the risk of a right roll and potential mast bumping\

  \  \n \nFinal Report 11 -003 |\n<< Page 27 >>\n information has been lost to the\
  \ New Zealand Robinson helicopter pilot fraternity , through the \ndilution of the\
  \ Robinson safety awareness training in New Zealand and the benign way in \nwhich\
  \ critical s afety information has been presented in the flight manual.  \nFinding\
  \ : \n6. The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology\
  \ it uses do \nnot draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and\
  \ situations that could \nresult in serious injury or death.  \n \nR22 safety performance\
  \ (New Zealand)  \nSafety issue  - The rate of R22 in -flight break -up accidents\
  \ in New Zealand has not been \nsignificantly reduced by the New Zealand version\
  \ of the FAA hazard mitigation measures \nintended to prevent such accidents.  \
  \ \n4.3.41.  The New Zealand R22 a ccident data  was analysed  and compared  with\
  \ the U SA data to provide \nan indication  of how the different approaches taken\
  \ by the FAA and the CAA had influenced \nthe accident rate s in the respective\
  \ countries. Four graphs are provided in Appendix 8  with a \nsummary below .  \n\
  4.3.42.  Accident data was obtained from the FAA and the CAA.  The list s of fatal\
  \ R22 accidents were \nreviewed from the pu blished accident briefs and categorised\
  \ into 3 groups to represent \naccidents that were likely to be examples of the\
  \ type s that the special safety awareness \ntraining26 was intended to prevent.\
  \  Each of t he 3  categories is shown  in a different colour in \nthe graphs  in\
  \ Appendix 8 .  The 3 categories are t hat the accident : \n\uF0B7 was caused by\
  \  an in -flight break -up of the helicopter  \n\uF0B7 was caused when the main\
  \ rotor speed decreased below acceptable \nlimits (low main rotor RPM)  \n\uF0B7\
  \ was caused by some other reason . such as pilot actions, collision with \ntrees,\
  \ heavy landing  or mechanical failure , and is therefor e not relevant  to \nthis\
  \ safety issue .   \n4.3.43.  The number of fatal accidents in New Zealand and the\
  \ USA related to in -flight break -up and \nlow rotor RPM was counted from 1985\
  \ to 1998 , and compared with the number from 1999 to \n2012. These date ranges\
  \ span ned 14 years and coincide d with both countr ies having the \nsame conditions\
  \ up to 1998 in relation to the SFAR 73 training requirements , but a diverging\
  \ \nsituation post 1998.  These numbers were divided by the average fleet size during\
  \ the same \nperiods to obtain an accident rate per operational helicopter , then\
  \ normalised to represent \naccidents per 1000 registered aircraft.  \n4.3.44. \
  \ The data does not show any low rotor RPM -type accidents  in New Zealand because\
  \ the \ninformation available did not list these as having fatal results.   \n4.3.45.\
  \  The U SA registration data is approximate because it is based on the number of\
  \ R22s \nregistered in September 2013 using the year s in which  they were manufactured.\
  \ Seventy -\nseven records from the FAA data did not contain values for the \"year\
  \ of manufacture \".  These \nrecords have been  excluded  but o ne was subsequently\
  \ reused because the helicopter's serial \nnumber indicated it had been  built in\
  \ 2 009 and otherwise there was no record for that year.    \n4.3.46.  The available\
  \ data did not include the average hours flown per aircraft per year, so the \n\
  Commission  could not determine if there were significant differences in R22 operations\
  \ \nbetween New Zealand and t he USA.  Consequently the exposure s to risk from\
  \ the selected \naccident causes may differ.  \n                               \
  \                         \n26 Described in SFAR 73.  \n \n \n<< Page 28 >>\n Final\
  \ Report 11 -003 4.3.47.  For the purposes of comparison, this analysis assumes\
  \ that flight hours per aircraft per year in \nthe 2 countries were  broadly similar,\
  \ and that aircraft use had stayed relatively constant \nduring  the period. On\
  \ this basis, the rate of fatal R22 accidents appear ed to have dropped \nduring\
  \  the period examined by a considerably greater degree in the USA than it had in\
  \ New \nZealand.  \n4.3.48.  In the U SA, the rate of fatal accidents  per 1000\
  \ register ed R22 aircraft dropped from 3.4  per \nyear from 1985 to 1998 to 1.4\
  \  per year from 1999 to 2012 (a 59 % reduction). The \ncorresponding figures in\
  \ New Zealand were a drop from 4.5  fatal accidents per year from \n1985 to 1998\
  \ to 3.7 per year from  1999 to 2012 (a 17 % reduction ). \n \n4.3.49.  These figures\
  \ indicate d low annual accident rates and did not provide a robust  basis for direct\
  \ \nstatistical  analysis between the 2 separate aeronautical jurisdictions .  \
  \ \n4.3.50.  The New Zealand accident rate has not trended downwards since the introduction\
  \ of safety \nawareness training in 1995.   There appears to have been an initial\
  \ reduction in R22 accidents  \npost 1995 , but since  the CAA introduced  reduced\
  \ safety awareness requirements in 1998,  \nNew Zealand has  had an average o f\
  \ one R22 in -flight break -up accident every 18 months  \nsince  2002 .   \n4.3.51.\
  \  These figures , together with the findings from the group discussion with senior\
  \ R22 \ninstructors , highlights again the need for the CAA to intervene and raise\
  \ awareness amongst \npilots and helicopter training organisations of the  characteristics\
  \ and limitations of the R22 \nhelicopter .  \nFinding  \n7. The rate of R22 in\

  \ by the pilot using a remote switch.  \n4.4.2.  Once activated , the ELT is designed\
  \ to transmit  continually  2 separate radio sig nals \nsequentially until it exhausts\
  \ the battery capacity or is turned off .  The first is a  low-power \ntransmission\
  \ intended as a homing signal .  The second  is a digital coded message transmitted\
  \ \nto a geosynchronous satellite network to alert the relevant re scue co -ordination\
  \ centre.  \n4.4.3.  When the helicopter crashed, the ELT activated but was so severely\
  \ damaged that it was \nunable to trans mit a useable location signal.  In this\
  \ case , however, the flight tracking device \ninstalled on the helicopter had been\
  \ transmit ting position reports to the operator's base, so \nwhen the helicopter\
  \ was reported overdue search aircraft were directed immediately to the \ngeneral\
  \ area where the helicopter had crashed.  \n4.4.4.  The failure of ELTs to function\
  \ correctly after crash es is a common co ncern worldwide.   \nSeveral investigations\
  \ have been conducted into the performance of ELTs27. The International \nCivil\
  \ Aviation Organization  and International Maritime Organization are actively seeking\
  \ \nimprovements in the c rash survivability of the transmitter s and for them to\
  \ have  mandatory \nglobal positioning system  (GPS) capabilit ies. \n4.4.5.  All\
  \ of the investigations concluded that insufficient accident data was being collected\
  \ on ELT \nperformance to make any meaningful recommendations.   \n4.4.6.  The CAA\
  \ carried o ut research into the use of ELTs and flight tracking devices in New\
  \ Zealand \nand compared the effectiveness and installation requirements of both\
  \ systems (CAA -1, 2010) .  \nThe report identified common issues with ELTs , including\
  \ cr ash survivability and aerial \ndisconnection failures.  It also reviewed data\
  \ available from the CAA database about ELT s and \nacknowledged th at CAA records\
  \ on ELT failures were unreliable.  \n4.4.7.  In the absence of any other comparable\
  \ system for locating aircraft fo llowing occurrence s, the \nCAA has continued,\
  \  and should continue , to support the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization\
  \ /International Maritime Organization  endeavours to improve the crash \nsurvivability\
  \ of ELTs .  At the time of drafting this report, the C AA was continuing to address\
  \ \ncrash tolerance with ELT manufacturers and was working with Rescue Coordination\
  \ Centre \nNew Zealand to test an internally mounted aerial .  It had also issued\
  \ an advisory circular (AC \n43-11) with details to improve the survivability of\
  \ ELT aerials  and conducted  ongoing \ndiscussions with licensed engineers and\
  \ operators.  No action had been taken towards \nimproving CAA data collection on\
  \ ELT su rvivability.  \nFlight tracking devices  \n4.4.8.  Separate flight tracking\
  \ device s can be installed by operator s if desired.   Flight tracking \ndevices\
  \ are not a direct substitute for ELT s because they do not alert anyone that a\
  \ crash has \noccurred.  They do , howeve r, provide a useful record of where an\
  \ aircraft has been and its \ngeneral location after an occurrence, as it did in\
  \ this case.  \n4.4.9.  The value of flight tracking devices and  the failure of\
  \ ELTs became a discussion point after a \nEurocopter EC120B ZK -HTF fatal accid\
  \ ent near Raglan in 2005 (CAA -1, 2010) .  The coroner \nrecommended that, \" CAA\
  \ immediately engage with representatives of the flight tracking device \nindustry\
  \ for the purposes of consultation to develop technical standards and minimum \n\

  \  the CAA was continuing to engage with New Zealand flight tracking \ndevice manufacturers\
  \ .  \n4.4.10.  Flight tra cking devices are still being installed under the classification\
  \ of \"portable electronic \ndevice s\" and as \"non-aeronautical avionics device\
  \ s/system s\".  The CAA has accepted these  \ninstallations  due to the benefit\
  \ s that flight tracking devices provide . \n4.4.11.  Opera tors should consider\
  \ installing flight tracking devices on their aircraft because they  \nimprove the\
  \ chances of aircraft being found as soon as possible following accident s, \nparticularly\
  \ in the event of ELT failure s. \nFinding s: \n8. A more crashworthy ELT would\
  \ not have altered the outcome of this accident , because \nthe crash was not survivable\
  \ and the flight tracking de vice was able to guide search  \naircraft  to the general\
  \ location of the crash site .  However, under different \ncircumstances a more\
  \ crashworthy ELT has the potential to save lives.  \n9. The flight tracking device\
  \ s in aircraft are a good enhancement for locating crashed and \ndisabled aircraft,\
  \ which means they have the potential to save lives . \n10. Improv ing the  crashworthiness\
  \ of ELTs fitted to aircraft will impr ove flight safety by \nspeeding up the search\
  \ and first response to aircraft accidents.  The CAA should \ncontinue to support\
  \ the international effort to improve standards for such devices.  \n  \n \nFinal\
