","0.0","5.0","The document does not provide evidence that human error or assumptions played a role in the accident. The investigation focused on mechanical and environmental factors.
","5.0","18.333","The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence (4.3.4, 4.3.30, 4.3.31). This indicates a potential lack of training and competency in understanding the limitations of the helicopter under such conditions.
","2.887","1.667","There is no evidence in the document to suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with the helicopter's equipment contributed to the accident.
","2.887","1.667","The document does not provide information on crew resource management issues or teamwork failures that contributed to the accident.
","2.887","1.667","The document does not indicate that a failure to adhere to safety procedures was a factor in the accident.
","2.887","10.0","The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots, and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimize the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations (4.3.5, 4.3.18, 4.3.25). This suggests issues with the organizational safety culture that could have contributed to the accident.

","5.774","18.333","The New Zealand regulatory system has not provided sufficient mandatory requirements and guidance for instructors, pilots, and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimize the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities (4.1.4.1, 4.3.5, 4.3.18). This lack of regulatory oversight and compliance is a contributing factor to the accident.
