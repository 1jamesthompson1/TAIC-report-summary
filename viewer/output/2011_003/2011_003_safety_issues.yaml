- The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots, and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities.
- The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and conditions that could result in serious injury or death.
- The rate of R22 in-flight break-up accidents in New Zealand has not been significantly reduced by the New Zealand version of the FAA hazard mitigation measures intended to prevent such accidents.
