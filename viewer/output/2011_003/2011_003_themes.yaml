- name: Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control
  explanation: 'Main rotor blade divergence and loss of control is a safety theme that involves the helicopter''s main rotor blades diverging from their normal plane of rotation, leading to a loss of control and potential in-flight break-up. This theme is relevant to the accident as the evidence indicated that "the main rotor blades had flapped up and down to the limit stops and the blades had flexed beyond their normal flexible range, causing permanent creases on the upper and lower surfaces" and "both main rotor blades had struck and separated the tail boom" (4.2.27). The report also states that "the cause of the in-flight break-up was main rotor blade divergence caused by a possible combination of the following factors: the helicopter entering low-gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of turbulence), turbulence, excessive movements of the cyclic control, low main rotor blade RPM" (5.2).'
- name: Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters
  explanation: Inadequate regulatory oversight for R22 and R44 helicopters is a safety theme that involves the lack of sufficient guidance and mandatory requirements from the regulatory body to minimize the risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilities. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report identifies that "The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations" (5.5). The report also highlights differences in regulatory approaches between the FAA and CAA, particularly after 1998, which may have influenced the accident rates in the respective countries (4.3.18).
- name: Flight manual clarity and terminology
  explanation: Flight manual clarity and terminology is a safety theme that concerns the way critical safety information is presented in the flight manual, including the use of terms like "Warning" and "Caution." This theme is relevant to the accident as the report finds that "The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety-critical instructions and situations that could result in serious injury or death" (5.6). The report also notes that the flight manual's "Limitations" section did not mention any airspeed limit for the helicopter in turbulent and windy conditions, which is a critical safety aspect given the R22's susceptibility to in-flight break-ups in such conditions (4.3.36).
- name: Turbulence and wind conditions
  explanation: Turbulence and wind conditions is a safety theme that involves the impact of atmospheric conditions on helicopter flight, particularly for light helicopters like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter was flying in conditions of "strong wind and moderate to extreme turbulence" at the time it broke up in flight (5.1). The report also mentions that "turbulence was likely to have been one of the main factors contributing to the in-flight break-up" (4.2.15).
- name: ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices
  explanation: ELT crashworthiness and flight tracking devices is a safety theme that involves the reliability of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) during crashes and the use of flight tracking devices to locate downed aircraft. This theme is relevant to the accident as the helicopter's ELT activated but was severely damaged and unable to transmit a usable location signal (4.4.3). The report also acknowledges the common concern of ELT failures after crashes and the potential benefits of flight tracking devices, which in this case, guided search aircraft to the general location of the crash (4.4.4, 4.4.11).
- name: Pilot experience and training
  explanation: Pilot experience and training is a safety theme that involves the level of knowledge and skill pilots have, particularly when flying helicopters with known handling characteristics and limitations like the R22. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report suggests that "The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence" (5.4). The report also highlights the diversity in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and the theory behind the Robinson safety awareness training (4.3.25).
