The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.   Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and  
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurr ence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On the morning of 27 April 2011, an instructor and a student pilot in a Robinson R22 
helicopter departed from Wanaka Aerodrome on  a cross -country training flight through part of 
the Southern Alps.  
1.2. The weather for the trip was fine with a southeast wind blowing across the Southern Alps to 
the west.  The wind was reported to be stronger than was indicated in the various aeronautical 
weather forecasts , at approximately 40  kilometres per hour  (km/h ), with gusts of up to 60 or 
70 km/h over the mountain passes.  The wind was causing turbulence on the leeward side of 
the mountains and passes, such as Matukituki Saddle.  
1.3. The outward leg of th e flight followed Lake Wanaka then travelled over Haast Pass to Neils 
Beach near the township of Haast.  There the pilots refuelled the helicopter for the return leg, 
which was back to Wanaka via Matukituki Saddle near Mount Aspiring.  
1.4. A flight -tracking dev ice on the helicopter showed it climbing to approach Matukituki Saddle, 
but instead of passing over the saddle it turned right over the nearby Waipara Saddle into the 
Arawhata River valley.  The helicopter was reported overdue later that afternoon.  The 
wreckage of the helicopter was found the next day in the Arawhata River valley .  Both pilots 
had died in the crash.  
1.5. The wreckage revealed that the helicopter had broken up in flight.  The Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission (Commission) determined that the helicopter had been  operating in 
a high -risk situation at the time due to a combination of factors - at an altitude of about 5500 
feet, close to its maximum permissible weight and entering an area of moderate to extreme 
turbulence.  
1.6. The Commission determined that the in -flight break -up was caused by  the main rotor blades 
deviating  from their normal operating plane of rotation  and striking the tail boom, causing a 
separation of the tail rotor assembly.  This was likely to have been caused by one or a 
combination of the following conditions:  
 severe or extreme turbulence buffeting t he helicopter  
 the main rotor speed being allowed to drop below its lower limit  
 the pilots making l arge and abrupt movements of the control s.  
1.7. Safety issues identified include:  
 a lack of knowledge within the industry has led to the possibility  that the instructor was 
not fully aware of the risks involved in flying the Robinson R22 helicopter near maximum 
weight  at high altitude, and in moderate to severe turbu lence  
 the format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do 
not draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and conditions that could 
result in serious injury or death  
 the rate of R22 in -flight break -up accid ents in New Zealand has not been  significantly  
reduced by the New Zealand version of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) hazard 
mitigation measures intended to prevent such accidents.  
1.8. A further but non -contributing safety issue was the crash survivability of emergency locator 
transmitters  (ELTs) , which  automatically alert rescue co -ordination centres when an aircraft 
accident or incident has occurred . 
1.9. The Commission made 2 recommendations  to the Director of Civil Aviation to address the pilot 
and instructor ratings on Robinson helicopters , and a further 2 recommendations to support 
international efforts to improve the crashworthiness of ELTs and promote the use of 
alternat ive aircraft tracking systems to aid search and rescue efforts.

 Final Report 11 -003 1.10.  The key lessons  from this investigation were : 
 any aviation regulatory system must ensure that recommended and permissible maximum 
operating parameters for an aircraft type are clearly and consistently articulated to pilots, 
regardless of the country in which the aircraft is operated  
 pilots must be fully aware of the operating limitations of aircraft they fly, and must always 
stay within those limitations.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Commission was notified of the overdue helicopter in Mount  Aspiring Na tional Park late 
afternoon on 27 April 2011.  The wreckage was found the next morning .  The Commission 
opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 
1990 later the same morning.  
2.2. One investigator travelled  from  Christchurch  to Wanaka on 28 April to liaise with Wanaka 
Police and another followed the next day from Wellington.  
2.3. The Police , under the control of the local coroner, had removed the deceased from the scene 
on 28 April and transported them to the local morgue.  
2.4. The site was examined on Friday 29 April by the 2 accident investigators with the assistance of 
2 local helicopter operators and Wanaka Police.  After gathering physical and photographic 
evidence, the available  wreck age was collected and airlifted back to a road end .  It was  then 
trucked to a storage location at Wanaka Aerodrome before being moved  to a Commission  
examination facility at Christchurch.  
2.5. Interviews were conducted with the operator and with pilots who had been flying at the time of 
the a ccident , and with the people who were in last contact with the pilots.  Further evidence 
was gathered from the operator.   
2.6. As the investigation progressed it became evident that there were wider training issues for the 
helicopter than those immediately appa rent.  The accident was an in -flight break -up and 
another such R22 accident occurred near Wanaka in 2012 before this inquiry was complete.  
Soon after that , in 2013 , a Robinson R66 helicopter  near Taupo  also appeared to have 
suffered a similar in -flight break-up.  Finally , a serious incident  occurred in New Plymouth in 
2013 .  In this incident , an instructor in an R22 recovered from a training exercise  during which 
the helicopter rolled more than  90º.  The helicopter incurred damage to the mast but the pilots 
were not injured and the helicopter was repairable . 
2.7. The Commission contacted the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United 
States of America (USA) to seek liaison contacts with the FAA and Robinson Helicopter 
Company in the USA.  The  NTSB had also investigated many R22 accidents and the 
Commission sought its opinion and assistance.  
2.8. An analysis of the evidence led the investigation to explore the regulator y environment s in 
New Zealand and  the USA.  This culminated in an industry meeti ng in Wellington in 2013 
between the Commission's investigators, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) and 
a group of experienced  Robinson R22 instructors from around the country.  
2.9. A draft report was submitted to the Commission for review on 25  September 2013.  
2.10.  The draft report was approved for distribution to interested persons  on 20 November 2013.   
At the request of one of the interested persons , the opportunity to provide comment  was 
extended to 7 February 2014.  Two submissions were received : one from the operator and 
one from the CAA.  Their submissions were considered and the report amended where 
appropriate.   The other interested persons  were contacted and declined to make any further 
comment.   
2.11.  The Commission approved the final report for publication on 26 Febru ary 2014.

 Final Report 11 -003 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  At 0952 on 27 April 2011 , an instructor and a student pilot in a Robinson R22 helicopter 
departed from Wanaka Aerodrome  on a cross -country  training flight  through part of the 
Southern Alps .  The helicopter registration was ZK -HMU and it was operated by  Wanaka 
Helicopters Limited .  
3.1.2.  The flight was conducted under visual flight rules and generally followed the operator's 
standard training route (No.4) for comm ercial helicopter cross -country training.  The outward 
leg ran approximately north from Wanaka aerodrome along the edge of Lake Wanaka, then  
followed State Highway 6 over Haast Pass to the township of Haast  and finally Neils Beach .  
The return leg initiall y followed the Arawhata River, then travelled up the Waipara River to 
cross Matukituki Saddle by Mount  Aspiring.  From there the helicopter would have followed 
the Matukituki River West Branch back to Wanaka.  The route was about 250 kilometres (km) 
(135 nautical miles)  and would normally take at least 2 hours ' flying time in ideal conditions.  
3.1.3.  The route was marked on the operator's flight planning board as "Wanaka - along lake - 
Haast - Jackson Bay - Aspiring - Wanaka" with an estimated arrival time back at  Wanaka of 
1200.  A fuel endurance of 3 hours was also noted  on the board . 
3.1.4.  The helicopter was equipped with a flight tracking device that sent a digital message via 
satellite back to a computer in the operator's office at Wanaka.  The time-stamped digital 
message was transmitted every 5 minutes with the helicopter's identification, current position, 
altitude , ground speed and direction of travel.  
3.1.5.  The f light tracking  log showed that t he helicopter followed the  outbound leg of the intended 
route through to Haast , then landed at Neils Beach  airstrip in Jackson Bay  at 1115 (about 35 
km south of Haast).   The weather conditions at Neils Beach were calm.  The local helicopter 
operator based at Neils Beach spoke with the pilots.  The  pilots told the local helicopt er 
operator that  they had only expected 10 knots wind en-route but estimated it to have been 
closer to 30 knots.  The instructor  also told the local helicopter operator that they might  have 
to divert on the way  back due to the weather conditions . They said that they intended to fly up 
the Arawhata River  (which meets the sea at Neils  Beach) . 
3.1.6.  The pilots loaded  40 l itres of fuel provided by the local operator2.  The instructor also 
telephoned  his base at Wanaka to extend  the helicopter 's estimated time of arrival to 1300.   
3.1.7.  The helicopter departed Neils  Beach at 1145 , but instead of following the Arawhata River it 
headed  west towards Jackson Head .  The flight tracking log showed that the helicopter flew 
south along the coast then turned inland above the Cascade River and continued east across 
the Arawhata River then  south along the Waipara River.   
3.1.8.  Pilots broadcast  regular  radio position reports while operating in the Southern Alps  so that 
other pilots in the area are aware of their intentions.  The last radio position report broadcast 
from  the helicopter was heard by the pilot of another aircraft in the area at  about 1220.  The 
pilot who responded recognised the instructor 's voice .  He said that the instructor  did not 
sound concerned about the co nditions and confirmed they were at 2000 feet and intending to 
cross  Matukituki Saddle .  The flight tracking log placed the helicopter in the Waipara River 
basin at that time.  
3.1.9.  The last flight tracking position report  was received via satellite  at 1230 , placing  the helicopter 
in the Arawhata River basin near Bow Peak at 5500 feet above mean sea level (see Figure 1, 
Position 1 ).  This was a n unexpected  deviation from the intended flight path  and showed  that 
the helicopter had crossed Waipara Saddle rather than the intended Matukituki Saddle . 
                                                        
2 The maximum fuel capacity was 113 litres, but with 2 pilots the maximum allowable fuel load was 
approximately 75 litres .

 3.1.10.  At about 1350 , Wanaka Helicopters ' operations staff noticed that the helicopter  had not 
returned and initiated a local airport check to confirm  that it was actually overdue .  Wanaka 
Helicopters notified Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand at 1508 .  By 1530 an official 
search and rescue operation was underway.  
3.1.11.  Helicopters were dispatched to search along the planned route and near the last known 
position report from the flight tracking device.  The search carried on through the night to 
about 0400 , then resumed at 0800 the same day.  Occasional ELT signals were detected 
overnight near the crash site , but the search helicopters were unable to pinpoint the location.  
3.1.12.  The helicopter wreckage was found near the head of the Arawhata River at about 0900 on 28 
April 2011.  Both pilots had died in the crash.

 3.2. Aircraft information  
3.2.1.  The Robinson R22 helicopter was designed as a 2 -seat commuter aircraft for general use and 
entered production in 1979.  In 1995 the FAA's Flight Standardization Board re -certified the 
R22 for general operations, including student training, private and comm ercial transport, 
agricultural work and external load operations.   
3.2.2.  The R22 flight manual additions by  the FAA and CAA to the "Limitations " section prohibit flight 
in moderate, severe or extreme turbulence by pilots unless they meet certain flying experi ence 
thresholds3.  Moderate turbulence is defined by the FAA and CAA as "Turbulence that causes 
changes in altitude or attitude; variations in indicated airspeed; and aircraft occupants to feel 
definite strains against their seat belts" .  The main referenc e to turbulence in the flight 
manual is the Robinson Safety Notice SN -32, which  states that "turbulence should be 
avoided4", then explains what to do if turbulence is inadvertently encountered.  A page 
inserted by the FAA to the "Emergency Procedures " section, which applies to all pilots, says 
that if a pilot has an "inadvertent encounter with moderate, severe or extreme turbulence" 
they are to "depart the area otherwise land the helicopter as soon as practical" . 
3.2.3.  There were approximately 350 light helicopte rs operating in New Zealand in 2012 and 90% of 
them were either the Robinson R22 or R445 type.  The major use was for flight training but 
they were  also used for scenic flights, aerial observation and photography, deer culling, stock 
mustering and private purposes . 
3.2.4.  This helicopter (ZK -HMU) had a current, non -terminating airworthiness certificate subject to it 
being maintained in accordance with its approved maintenance schedule. The most recent  
Review of Airworthiness had been  completed on 23 December 2010 with no remarks or 
defects to be corrected. The next Review of Airworthiness was due on 22 December 2011.  
3.2.5.  The most recent  maintenance check had been  a 100 -hour check completed at 1260.9 hours 
(airframe) on 30 March 2011 and the next check due was a 50 -hour check at 1306.5 hours.  
The total aircraft time logged on the day before the accident was 1300 hours (airframe).  
3.2.6.  Figure s 2 and 3 show how the main rotor blades are connected to the helicopter at the main 
rotor head assembly.  The main rotor hub is attac hed to the main rotor  shaft (mast) by the 
teeter bolt, which allows the main rotor hub and main rotor blades to tilt together.  The 2 main 
rotor blades are attached (hinged) to the main rotor hub by coning bolts, which allow them to 
flap independently up a nd down  on the rotor hub .  The rotor hub and main rotor blades are 
said to rotate in a disc (the rotor disc) .  The direction of the helicopter is controlled by  tilting  
the rotor disc forward, ba ck, left or right  from its usual position .  The helicopter tra vels in the 
direction in which the disc is tilted . 
3.2.7.  The rotor disc is altered by the pilot using the cyclic and collective controls to alter the pitch 
angle of the main rotor blades.  Through a system of control linkages the swashplate  is moved 
vertically up and down or tilted.  The movement of the swashplate adjusts the pitch of the 
main rotor blades through the pitch links.  If the swashplate is moved vertically up or down, 
both main rotor blades receive an equal change in pitch and t he helicopter rises or descends 
accordingly.  If the swashplate is tilted the change in pitch is unequal, which causes the rotor 
disc to tilt and the helicopter to change direction accordingly.  
3.2.8.  If the helicopter encounters turbulence, the main rotor blade s flap up or down to compensate 
for minor variations in the resultant aerodynamic forces.  Normally the blades flap within their 
upper and lower limits.  The upper limit is when the blade spindle contacts the up -coning stop.  
The lower limit is when the sp indle tusk contacts the droop stop.  If a main rotor blade pushes 
against either of these limit stops, this may influence the rotor disc to tilt further.  If the main

prohibited ".

 3.2.9.  Mast bumping occurs when the main rotor blade exceeds its flapping limits, causing the main 
rotor hub to "bump" into the main rotor shaft  as shown in the diagram below6.  The condition 
can lead to complete failure of the hollow main rotor shaft , resulting in the main rotor blade 
breaking away from the helicopter.   
 
 
3.3. Site examination  
3.3.1.  The main  wreckage was located in a narrow , rocky stream bed , with most of the debris strewn 
300 metres (m)  back along the last known flight path  from Waipara Saddle.  The exception was 
the outer section of one main rotor blade , which was found about 50 m ahead of the main 
wreckage  (see Figure 5).  The impact damage indicated that the helicopter had struck  a large 
boulder while in an upright position from a near -vertical traject ory.  The fuel tanks had burst 
open upon impact , spilling aviation fuel around the area .  There was no fire.  
3.3.2.  The wreckage trail began with t he red -and-white tail rotor guard and part of the tail boom .  
These  were found  several metres apart  about  300 m back  from the main wreckage .  The 
complete  tail rotor assembly (including the tail fin ) were  found  145 m back  from the ma in 
wreckage .  Smaller Perspex fragments from  the canopy and the red anti -collision beacon were 
found scattered along this first part of the wreckage trail .

 3.3.3.  Both main rotor blades had fractured about 700 millimetres out from the hub .  One blade  had 
separated at that point  and the outer section was found 50  m ahead of the main wreckage.  
The outer leading edge  of both main rotors had  paint transfer  marks that matched the paint 
and impact impressions on the tail boom.  
3.3.4.  The upper and lower surfaces of both main rotor blades were creased .  The c reasing indicated  
that the main rotor blades had bent up and down vertically to the extent nece ssary to cause a 
permanent deformation of the surface skin .  They also showed horizontal deformation , which 
is typically caused when the blades strike an object  while t he hub is still being driven.  
3.3.5.  One of the main rotor spindle tusks had bent outwards and scored the inside surface of the 
rotor head (visible in  Figure 6).  The up -coning stop surfaces both showed evidence of crush 
damage.  Both teeter stops had been crushed by the blade spindle compressing against the 
main rotor shaft.  These are typical indications that excessive rotor blade flapping and mast 
bumping ha d occurred.  
3.3.6.  The 2 pitch links from the swashplate  to the main rotor blade pitch horns and the swashplate  
drive link from the rotor shaft had snapped under tension at their narrowest diameter , in the 
trough of the adj ustment thread.  One pitch link had broken at both ends and was not found.  
The other pitch link had snapped at the main rotor blade pitch horn end but was stil l 
connected at the swashplate .  The failure  of the pitch links would have rendered the helicopte r 
uncontrollable.  
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The autopsy reports  identified  that both pilots died from injuries sustained in the accident . 
3.4.2.  A toxicology analysis of blood samples taken from the pilots found no evidence of alcohol or 
performance -impairing substan ces.  Blood carbon monoxide levels were consistent with 
normal levels observed in the general population.  
3.4.3.  The student pilot was training for his commercial licence .  He was sitting in the right -hand seat 
where the pilot -flying would normally sit.  He was 2 1 years old and held a current private pilot 
licence (helicopter) issued on 22 March 2011.  He held a current C lass 2  medical certificate .  
The student pilot had had 88 hours ' total flying experience in R22 and R44 helicopters before 
the accident flight, i ncluding 23 hours on the type in the previous 30 days.  He had 
satisfactorily completed both the ground and flight training parts of the Robinson safety

 Final Report 11 -003 awareness training on 1 February 2011 .  He had also  completed his mountain flying training 
to private pilot standard on 24 February 2011.  
3.4.4.  The instructor was 31 years old .  He held a commercial pilot licence (helicopter), a Category B 
instructor's rating and a current C lass 1 medical certificate.  He had 19 55 hours ' total flying 
experience in helicopters, mostly in the R22 and R44 types .  He had flown 1440 hours in the 
R22, of which  63 hours had been in the previous 30 days.  A significant proportion of his total 
flying time had been  in the mountainous area  near Wanaka , including in the vicinity of the 
accident site . 
3.4.5.  The instructor  had passed the Robinson safety awareness training for the ground and air 
components provided by Wanaka Helicopters on 28 April 2009 . His Flight Crew Biennial Flight 
Review had been  completed on 12 June 2009.  His most recent  Flight Crew Competency 
Check had been  completed on 4 June 2010 and his "B" category Helicopter Instructor 
Renewal on 5 January 2011.   
3.4.6.  The operating company had internally rated the instructor as one of its category A pilots , which 
authorised him to run day -to-day company operations and oversee all other staff , including 
other instructors.  
3.5. Meteorological information  
3.5.1.  A situation forecast map  obtained from MetService after the accident showed an anticyclone 
centred over Tasmania moving towards New Zealand , with an associated cold front moving up 
towards the South Island from the Southern Ocean  (see Appendix 2: Weather forecasts ).  
There was a steep atmospheric pressure gradient across the South Island aligned north -south 
along the Southern Alps .  The pressure gradient ranged from about 1033 hectopascals  (hPa) 
on the eastern  (Wanaka)  side of the Southern Alps  to 1024 hPa on t he West Coast.  
3.5.2.  During the search  for the overdue helicopter , Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand 
requested a mountain fo recast from MetService .  The forecast  for the Mount  Aspiring area for 
1830 on 27 April 2011  through  to 0600 the next day said that southeast winds could be 
expected at 20 km/h gusting to 30 km/h and gradually easing overnight.  The forecast also 
said that winds through the valleys and passes at about 500 m above sea level would be east 
to southeast at about 40 km/h , gusting to 60 -70 km/h  (22 knots gusting 32 -38 knots) .  
3.5.3.  The pilots of the search helicopters reported strong winds and associated turbulence in the 
search area during the afternoon and evening.  The conditions were such that the movement 
of the helicopters was rest ricted in some locations.  The winds abated during the night.  
Weather information available to the pilots  
3.5.4.  MetService records  showed that weather information had been  downloaded by the operator at 
0828, 0844 and 0906  on the day of the accident .  This included area forecasts for the 3 
meteorological areas  that the flight would transit, aerodrome forecasts and aerodrome routine 
meteorological reports for Wanaka, Queenstown, Westport, Hokitika and Milford Sound.   
3.5.5.  The area forecast (ARFOR) valid to 1400 on the day of the accident for east of the Southern 
Alps predicted broken strato cumulus with a base at 4000 feet and tops around 6000 feet .  
The cloud base was expected to drop to 3000 feet on the west  but tops remain ing at 6000 
feet. No significant weather , turbulence or ice was expected.  Upper winds from 5000 feet to  
10 000 feet on both sides of the Alps were from 120°True to 160°True , with corresponding  
wind speed s ranging from  5 to 10 knots on the eastern side and slightly higher on the western 
side, from 10 to 20 knots.  
3.5.6.  The applicable aerodrome  forecast (TAF) expected the 2000 -feet wind at Wanaka to be a 10-
knot easterly .  The same forecast  for the West Coast aerodrome s predicted  5- to 15-knot 
winds  from the southeast . 
3.5.7.  In summary the reported mean sea -level air pressure was 10 hPa lower on the west  side of 
the Southern Alps than on the east side .  The wind was forecast to be stronger on the western

 Final Report 11 -003 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The evidence from the accident site revealed that the helicopter had suffered an in -flight 
break -up.  The wreckage trail was consistent with the tail rotor and another section of the tail 
boom having been severed  by successive strikes of the main rotor bla des.  From that point the 
helicopter was uncontrollable, and the crash inevitable.  
4.1.2.  The damage observed in components making up the  main rotor blade assembly revealed that 
the main rotor blades had flapped to extreme up and down angles  against the physical stops 
and diverged from their normal plane of rotation to strike  the tail boom7.   
4.1.3.  No evidence was found that a pre -existing mechanical condition contributed to the in -flight 
break -up.  However, the high impact forces with the ground and resultant damage t o the 
engine and its auxiliary components meant it was not possible to determine with any certainty  
how well the engine had been  performing at the time of the in -flight break -up.  The  possibility 
of an engine problem having contribut ed to the accident could not therefore be excluded .  No 
evidence was found of medical  or toxicological factors having contributed to the accident.  
4.1.4.  Four  safety issues ar ose out of this inquiry:  
1. The New Zealand regulatory system has not  provide d sufficient mandatory requirements 
and guidance for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 
helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilit ies.  
2. The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do 
not draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and conditions that could 
result in serious injury or death.  
3. The rate of R22 in -flight break -up accidents in New Zealand has not been reduced by the 
New Zealand version o f the FAA hazard mitigation measures intended to prevent such 
accidents.  
4. The crashworthiness of the ELT, which was designed to alert and guide emergency 
services to a crash site , was inadequate . 
4.2. What happened  
The flight  
4.2.1.  There was a  significant difference i n atmospheric pressure between Wanaka on the e ast side 
of the Southern Alps and the West Coast .  Wind will generally flow from  the higher -pressure 
area towards the lower pressure8.  The general  wind direction on the day of the accident was 
from east to west across  the Southern Alps.  This meant that the winds would  be stronger 
across the mountain saddles and passes than at lower levels.  A stronger wind in mountainous 
terrain means more turbulence.  
4.2.2.  Other local pilots had noted the pressure differential a nd several also commented that actual 
wind speeds were higher than those forecast.  
4.2.3.  The strength of the actual wind conditions high in the mountain passes was not immediately 
obvious from the aeronautical  forecasts  or from the conditions at Wanaka  when the helicopter 
departed .  The maximum forecast wind at 2000 feet was about 15 knots .  Nevertheless, the 
instructor was experienced in mountain flying in the area and he had told the local helicopter 
operator at Neils  Beach that the winds were stronger than he had expected for the outward 
                                                        
7 This type of accident cause is called "main rotor divergence" and "loss of control" in accordance with a 
standard taxonomy.

 leg of the flight.  He had also said that he was prepared to alter the return route if necessary.  
The instructor was  therefore expecting strong  wind and associated turbulence for the return 
leg to Wanaka.  
4.2.4.  The return leg from Neils  Beach began with a diversion south to the Cascade River before 
intercepting the usual route up the Arawhata River  and then up the Waipara River .  The reason 
for this diversion could not be established .  The subsequent track after this diversion was a s 
expected.  
4.2.5.  The approach to  Matukituki Saddle was into the wind.  The standard technique for crossing a 
mountain saddle from a blind valley into the wind is to approach it on an angle from one side 
of the valley , thereby providing for an escape path  away from the saddle  and back down the 
valley .  Ideally t he escape path should result in  the helicopter turning  away from the terrain on 
the selected  side of the valley and towards the direction from which the wind  is coming , then  
to fly  back down the sam e valley from where it has come (CAA, 2006) .  The flight tracking 
record showed the helicopter flying up the right -hand side of the Waipara River valley9.  This 
was consistent with the standard technique for  the wind  conditions  on the day .  From that side 
of the valley the  escape route would have been to turn left across the wind and reverse back 
down the Waipara River  valley ( see Figure 1). 
4.2.6.  Instead the helicopter crossed Waipara Saddle to the right  (see Figure 7) .  It could not be 
determined with any certainty why this happened.  The flight plan was to cross Matukituki 
Saddle , an area with which the instructor was familiar,  and the pilots had reconfirmed this in 
their last radio position report, onl y about 10 minutes before the accident.  
4.2.7.  It is possible that the helicopter was forced across Waipara Saddle by a strong wind spilling 
over the saddle from the direction of Matukituki Saddle.  
4.2.8.  Five other helicopter pilots operating in the same area during th at same afternoon reported 
strong winds from the east, and severe turbulence.   
4.2.9.  One pilot was flying a Hughes 369 helicopter in the area.  He said that he passed over 
Arawhata Saddle (about 2 km from the accident site) about an hour after the accident.  He  
described the turbulence along his route as being "pretty terrific".  He participated in the 
search later in the day and experienced severe turbulence near the south -eastern face of Bow 
Peak, near Waipara Saddle  where  the last flight tracking position rep ort was recorded .  The 
turbulence was so severe that it prevent ed him searching that area.  
4.2.10.  Another  search pilot flew a Eurocopter EC130 over Matukituki Saddle about 3 hours after the 
accident.  He found it too rough to remain in the area to the west of the  saddle , so he flew 
over Waipara Saddle towards the last known position of the helicopter.  He estimated the wind 
across Waipara Saddle into the Arawhata River basin to be 30 knots and experienced very 
rough turbulence as he flew past Bow Peak.

 Wreckage trail  
4.2.11.  The tail rotor section and another section of the tail boom were found near the start of the 
wreckage trail .  This is  almost certain ly a sign that the tail boom was severed by the main rotor 
blades  and is  supported by the paint transfer marks from the tail boom found on both main 
rotor blades, the impact impressions on the tail boom and the fact that both main rotor blades 
were bent  backwards in the horizontal plane.   This rearward bending of the main rotor blades 
also supports a conclusion that the main rotor blades were being driven at the time they 
struck  the tail boom, meaning the engine was probably still delivering power when the break -
up seq uence began.  With t he loss of the tail boom and rotor, the helicopter would have 
become instantly uncontrollable.  Figure 8 shows the angle at which the main rotor blades 
would have div erged from the main rotor plane in order to strike  the tail boom in this way.  
4.2.12.  There are several factors that can in combination cause main rotor divergence:  
 low-gravity flight  
 turbulence  
 large , abrupt control movements  by the pilots  
 low main rotor revolutions per minute ( RPM ). 
 
Figure 8

Low-gravity flight  
4.2.13.  Low-gravity flight is a situation when  the occupants feel a sensation of weightlessness.  It can 
be induced by the pilot performing a climb then suddenly push ing over into a dive or level 
flight .  One possible result  of low -gravity  flight accidents  is mast bumping10, and if the main 
                                                        
10 Mast bumping is where the main rotor blades flap beyond their normal limits and the blade spindles bump 
against  the main rotor shaft ( mast ).   

 
 
<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report 11 -003 rotor blades strike the airframe, this is typically on the left side of the cabin11.  This did not 
happen in  this case.  Also, an examination of the mast under the crushed teeter stops showed 
that the mast bumping had not been severe enough to damage the mast.  The evidence of 
mast bumping was limited to the teeter stops only .  For these reasons , low-gravity fli ght was 
unlikely to have been the main factor contributing to the main rotor divergence.  However, the 
possibility that it was a contributing factor due to turbulence cannot be excluded.  
Turbulence  
4.2.14.  Turbulence is graded as light, moderate, severe or extreme. Light turbulence is when the 
turbulence causes slight erratic changes in attitude or altitude. At the other end of the scale, 
extreme turbulence is capable of structural damage.  The grading is  subjective and related to 
the weight of the aircraft .  A pilot of a light helicopter may regard turbulence as moderate but a 
pilot in a commercial airliner may regard the same turbulence as light.   
4.2.15.  Flying in turbulence is a known contributor to  main rotor divergence.  A large gust downwards 
through the rot or disc can lead to unloading of the rotor blades, which can result in low -gravity 
flight.  A large gust upward would load the rotor blades and increase the blade angle of 
attack11.  Either situation can be exacerbated if the pilot responds by over -controlling the 
helicopter  in the turbulence, which can result in excessive blade flapping and lead to main 
rotor divergence.  The helicopter was highly likely to have been in severe  or extreme  
turbulence soon after crossing Waipara Saddle.  Turbulence was likely to have been one of the 
main factors contributing to the in -flight break -up. 
Large , abrupt control inputs  
4.2.16.  The R22 is very responsive to pilot movements on the controls , especially the cyclic control,  
and requires only light forces to achieve full control movement. A pilot who makes several 
consecutive large and abrupt control movement s in either pitch or roll may cause the main 
rotor blades to f lap excessively , which may  lead to main rotor divergence .  Pilot control 
movements may be accentuated in turbulence  if the pilot tries to overcompensate for the 
external buffeting.  The NTSB  concluded in a study that "large  and abrupt control inputs by the  
pilot can lead directly to mast bumping or induce blade stall, which in turn can lead to mast 
bumping" (NTSB, 1996) . 
4.2.17.  It could not be determined which of  the instructor or student  pilot was flying the helicopter at 
the time of the in -flight break -up.  The instructor had more experience flying the R22 
helicopter so was likely to have been more capable in turbulent weather conditions than the 
student .  If the student  was flying the helicopter at the time, it is possible that over -controlling 
the helicopter could have occurred before the instructor had time to take over or limit the 
amount of control deflection in response to turbulence.  The  issue of regulatory requir ements 
in New Zealand that govern when a pilot is allowed to manipulate the controls in R22 
helicopters is discussed later in this report.  
Low main rotor revolutions per minute  
4.2.18.  In normal flight the lift generated by the main rotor blades supports the weigh t of the 
helicopter.  The centrifugal force applied to the main rotor  blades from the speed of rotation 
balances  the lift they also generate and prevents them bending upwards  too far .  If the 
rotational speed of the main rotor is allowed to reduce  below th e lower limit , the reduction in 
centrifugal force will no longer balance the lift , which will  allow the blades to  flap up 
excessively .   
4.2.19.  A second ary effect of  low rotor RPM  is "rotor stall ". This is when the angle of airflow across the 
rotor blade exceeds a critical value  and the blade is no longer able to generate lift.  Main rotor 
stall is unlikely to occur symmetrically, which can lead to main rotor divergence and the blades 
striking the airframe.

<< Page 19 >>
 4.2.20.  Engine failure or a partial loss of engine power may also cause a low rotor RPM  situation if the 
pilot does not take appropriate action  in time to maintain rotor RPM .  A further  cause can be  
when  a pilot makes an excessive  or abrupt upward movement  on the collective  control. This 
could cause  the main rotor blades to over -pitch , and the  resulting aerodynamic  drag on the 
blades may exceed the available engine power.  This is more likely to occur at higher altitude 
or when the helicopter is heavier , as was the case in this accident, because in these 
conditions the rotor blades are already operating at high pitch angles  to generate the required 
thrust to keep the helicopter in the air . 
4.2.21.  The R22 at maximum fuel capacity has about 3 hours ' flying  endurance.  However, with 2 
average -weight12 pilots it can only carry sufficient fuel for  about 2 hours ' endurance  without 
exceeding the maximum permissible loading .  The operator's practice at Wanaka was to fill 
both helicopter tanks partially , up to the hose nozzle ( two-thirds  capacity or about 70 litres) for 
dual cross -country flights, giving about 2 hours ' flight duration.  The fuel taken on at Wanaka 
before the flight was from an unmetered bulk tank.  After flying to Neils  Beach  the pilots  added  
another 40 litres of fuel ( equivalent to one to 1.5 hours ' flying time) . 
4.2.22.  Assuming that the operator's standard practice had been followed, a t the time of the accident 
the helicopter would  have had sufficient fuel remaining for about  1.5 hours of flying .  In this 
case it would have been just under the maximum permissible weight . 
4.2.23.  An inspection of the maintenance records for the helicopter revealed nothing of concern.  The 
evidence indicate d that the engine was delivering some power when the main rotor blades  
struck the tail boom.  However, the damage  to the engine and components caused by the 
ground impact precluded any meaningful post -accident performance testing of the engine.  
Therefore the possibility of a partial drop in engine performance contributing t o main rotor 
RPM  decay could not be excluded.  
Likely sequence of events  
4.2.24.  The helicopte r was flying above 5000 feet to cross  Matukitu ki Saddle  and it was close to its 
maximum permissible weight.  It was therefore flying in conditions of reduced power margin .  It 
was also flying into an area of moderate  to extreme  turbulence.  The helicopter manufacturer 
recommended that  strong winds or turbulence  be avoided .  Pilots who inadvertently encounter 
turbulence are recommended to maintain an average indicated airspeed of between 60 and 
70 knots .  They are also warned against over -controlling the helicopter in response to 
turbulence13. 
4.2.25.  As previously mentioned, it could not be established which of the pilots was manipulating the 
controls , but they would have exper ienced some degree of turbulence during the flight that 
day.  If the student pilot with less R22 flying experience14  was manipulating  the controls , the 
risk of over -controlling the helicopter in response to turbulence was higher15.  However, the 
last record ed position of the helicopter and the wreckage trail show ed that after deviating 
from the planned route and crossing Waipara Saddle , the helicopter travelled about one 
kilometre  before the in -flight break -up began.  If the instructor had had any concern s about 
the student 's capability in turbulence there  should have been  ample time to take back the 
controls when they started to deviate from the planned route . 
4.2.26.  The risk of an in -flight break -up from a main rotor blade divergence event was high a s the 
helico pter approach ed Matukituki Saddle .  It was high  due to the helicopter being near 
maximum weight  and at a relatively high altitude, the strong wind , and flying in moderate  to 
extreme  turbulence.  The se conditions were challenging even for an experienced  R22 pilot 
because t hey could  in combination cause main rotor blade divergence , particularly if the pilot

(Appendix 6) .

) .

 Final Report 11 -003 responded with excessive movements of the cyclic control  or an abrupt upward movement on 
the collective control . 
4.2.27.  The following e vidence from the wreckage show ed that the in-flight break -up was caused by 
main rotor divergence : 
 the main rotor blades had flapped  up and down to the limit stops and the 
blades had flexed beyond their normal flexible range , causing  permanent 
creases on the upper and lower  surfaces  
 the main rotor hub had teetered beyond the design limit  and crushed both 
teeter stops (mast bump)  
 the 2 pitch links  had snapped under tension at the blade pitch horn  ends  and 
the drive link had snapped at the swashplate  end 
 both main rotor blades had struck  and separated the tail boom . 
4.2.28.  The flight up the Waipar a River valley was consistent with the civil aviation guidelines for 
approaching and crossing mountain saddles.  If something started to go wrong, the typical 
escape path sho uld have been a left turn across the wind and a head ing back down the river 
valley.  Instead the helicopter trave lled right , over Waipar a Saddle and into an area of 
descending air and turbulence.  This unexpected  diversion from the intended route for the 
helicopter was unlikely to have been deliberate.  The helicopter was possibly forced across 
Waipara S addle by a strong cross -wind  as it gained height  to clear Matukituki Saddle , and the 
pilots possibly decided that the safer option was to turn with the win d and escape down the 
Arawhata R iver valley instead.  
Findings:  
1. The helicopter was operating in conditions of reduced power margin  where it was near 
to the maximum allowable weight, and flying at relatively high altitude in strong wind 
and moderate to extre me turbulence , at the time it broke up in flight.  
2. The cause of the in -flight break -up was main rotor blade divergence caused by a 
possible combination of the following factors:  
 the helicopter entering low -gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of tur bulence)  
 turbulence  
 excessive  movements  of the cyclic control  
 low main rotor blade RPM .  
3. There was no evidence found that mechanical failure initiated the in -flight break -up, but 
the major damage to the engine and other components meant that the possibili ty of this 
could not be excluded.  
 
4.3. History  of the R22 helicopter  
4.3.1.  The circumstances of this in -flight break -up accident were not dissimilar to others  involving  
R22 helicopters.  The FAA first certified the R22  in 1979.  In the following 15 years  there were  
a number  of fatal R22 crashes around the world , where helicopter s had broke n up in flight.  
Often the investigations were inconclusive or found  no apparent cause s, but there were some 
common failure modes .  Either t he main rotor had diverge d from its norm al plane to strike  the 
tail boom or cockpit , or the drive shaft had severed , allowing the main rotor to detach  
completely  from the helicopter . 
 
Final Report 11 -003 |
<< Page 21 >>
 4.3.2.  These accidents prompted the FAA to conduct  3 Special Certification Reviews o f the R22 in 
1982, 1988 and 1994 .  The purpose of these reviews was  to check that the helicopter  
complied with the certification requirements16.  The review teams initiate d some changes and 
raised some concerns.  They expressed doubt about the validity of the FAA certification 
requirements f or small helicopters  and considered that the one-second pilot response time17 
to certain events was too short , particularly for an aircraft  used for training .  Further research 
was recommended18. 
4.3.3.  A further  review by the FAA Flight Standardization Board in 1995 , convened to consider 
training requirements for R22 pilots , reported (FAA FSB, 1995) : 
The Robinson R -22 has characteristics which makes awareness of certain 
aerodynamic factors mandatory.  The awareness of low "G" operatio ns, rotor 
blade stall potential, energy management, and low rotor RPM recovery 
techniques are critical.  
4.3.4.  This review report set out training and currency requirements for R22 pilots and instructors 
and suggested design changes deemed necessary for ensuring the safe operation of the R22.   
The report recommended  that the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR)  Part 27 be reviewed with 
regard to main rotor inertia in single -engine helicopters .  
4.3.5.  The NTSB w as also concerned with the safety of the R22 .  Its concern was prompted by  
another fatal accident in 1992.  The  damage characteristics were similar to other main rotor 
blade divergence accidents .  The pilot  was an experienced R22 pilot  and the accident 
occurred in apparently benign circumstances .  The NTSB launched a special investigation 
(NTSB, 1996) .  The investigation researched 34  similar accidents involving R22 and  R44 
helicopters.  
4.3.6.  During the 4 -year investigation, the NTSB issued 11 safety recommendations to the FAA.   
Some of these initial safety recommendations required immediate action and other 
recommendations called  for further testing to gain a better understanding of  the rotor system  
dynamics .  All 11 safety recommendations had been closed by the time the NTSB r eport was 
published in 1996.  The NTSB considered that the safety actions implemented by the FAA up 
to the date the report was  published had been effective in reducing accidents of this type.  
4.3.7.  The NTSB report concluded that the R22 was more  responsive than other light helicopters to 
pilots ' cyclic control inputs and that the cause of many of the "loss of main rotor control " 
accidents  likely  stemmed from pilots making large and abrupt control movements .  The NTSB 
considered  that the low -inertia rotor could diverge from the normal rotation plane and strike 
the fuselage within 0.5 seconds , so flight instructors would not have sufficient time to react to 
large or abrupt control movements by trainee s unless they were actually holding the cyclic 
control s19.  
4.3.8.  The NTSB acknowledged the numerous operational changes implemented by the FAA to 
ensure that R22 pilots were more knowledgeable about  specific R22 hazards and were better 
trained , and that flights in adverse weather conditions by inexperienced pilots were limit ed.  
Accident data since the changes had been implemented in 1995 suggested to the NTSB at 
the time that the corrective actions should help to prevent such accidents19.    
4.3.9.  In 1996 the NTSB issued 6 new safety recom mendations with the final report.  The first 
recommendation  was to make the FAA's requirement for R22 pilots to undergo special safety 
awareness training permanent (see the section below on "Special safety awareness training ") 
and the rest were for further research and the requirement fo r light helicopter manufacturers 
                                                        
16 Code of Federal Regulation 14 CFR Part 27.  
17 Part of the helicopter certification tests to CFR Part 27 requires that for one condition, the minimum time 
delay for corrective action may be one second or the pilot reaction time, whichever is greater .  For other test 
conditions  the pilot reaction time  is accepted . No value is defined for pilot reaction time.   
18 These facts are described in NTSB, 1996.

 of the NTSB report, 1996.

 Final Report 11 -003 to provide standard information about control sensitivity. The NTSB closed the last of these 6 
safety recommendations on 17 March 2010.  
4.3.10.  Improvements were made to the helicopter throttle governor and low rotor RPM warning 
system , but o ther issues could  not be resolved with simple modifications. The FAA and the 
NTSB still held  concern s about the following residual safety issues : 
1. Low rotor RPM  - The very short time a pilot had in the R22 to respond if the main rotor 
RPM  reduced  below the normal acceptable range.  This short response time was also the 
focus  of concern with the airworthiness standards  noted in separate FAA reviews .  
2. Mast bumping  - When the main rotor plane is tilted in relation  to the mast drive shaft 
beyon d its physical limits , and the blade spindles contact  the mast at each revolution.  
Within a few revolutions , one or both of the main rotor  blades  could  either completely or 
partially separate from the rest of the helicopter . 
3. Main rotor divergence and loss  of control  - Situations where the R22 main rotor could 
diverge from its normal plane  of rotation and strike  either  the cockpit or the tail boom.   
The public records from the NTSB and the FAA show that they could not determine the 
root cause of main rotor divergence and it was too risky to conduct flight experiments.  A 
mathematical model to simulate and study the condition was  also abandoned.   
4. Low-gravity condition  - The helicopter is flown in a manner that makes the crew 
experience a feeling of weightlessness .  Under low -gravity situations the R22 can roll 
unexpectedly to the right , but the pilot's response on the control s, according to the flight 
manual , must be with an aft cyclic  movement rather than the more intuitive left cyclic  to 
counter the roll .  An intuitive response by the pilot could rapidly develop into a mast 
bump.  The flight manual  "cautions " pilots that under no circumstances may this 
manoeuvre be  demonstrated or  practised in flight20.  The manoeuvre is prohibited in the 
"Limitations " section  of the manual . 
Special safety awareness training  
4.3.11.  The FAA decided to address the residual concerns aris ing from the 3 Special Certification 
Reviews and the NTSB special investigation by mandating special  safety  awareness training 
for pilots and placing operating restrictions when the R22 helicopter s were  flown by  
inexperienced pilots.   The FAA was also concerned that the R44  helicopter  had similar 
characteristics to the R22.   The FAA considered these issues so critical that its response in 
1995 was to mandate special safety awareness training for all R22 and R44 pilots before they 
could conduct their nex t flight s.  The requirement was described in Special Federal Aviation 
Regulation 73 (SFAR 73) , which also set a threshold for minimum pilot experience.  Pilots with 
less than the minimum experience would be subject to additional flight restrictions describ ed 
in SFAR 73  (see Appendix 6: The current version of SFAR 73 ). 
4.3.12.  Airworthiness directives (ADs) were  issued at the time to set limits for inexperienced R22  and 
R44 pilots.  They were not allowed to fly the helicopter s when winds were a bove a set range or 
in conditions of moderate or worse turbulence.  
4.3.13.  Initially SFAR 73 was temporary and the AD s were permanent .  The status has changed over 
the years to SFAR 73 being made permanent on 29 June 2009 , and remaining applicable to 
both the R22 and R44 helicopters.  The AD s setting limits for inexperienced pilots remained  
permanent for the R22 , but were  rescinded for the R44  because the FAA determined that it 
was no longer necessary to correct an unsafe condition .   
4.3.14.  The FAA introduction paragraph in the "Normal Procedures " section of the flight manual  stated 
(FAA, 1996)  : 
                                                        
20 This change was made with airworthiness directives AD 95 -11-09 for the R22 and AD 95 -11-10 for the 
R44.

 Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions and aircraft 
characteristics that lead to main rotor blade/fusela ge contact accidents, and 
corrective type design changes and operating limitations are identified, Model 
R22 pilots are strongly urged to become familiar with the following information 
and comply with these recommended procedures:  
[The insert ed text went o n to describe  main rotor stall and mast bumping 
situations and preventive techniques including a recommended, across -the-
board limit of  maximum speed to 0.9  Vne (velocity to never exceed). ] 
New Zealand response  
Safety issue  - The New Zealand regulatory oversight provide d insufficient guidance and 
mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and 
R44 helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' capabilit ies. 
4.3.15.  The R22 helicopter type certificat e (H10WE)  prescribe d the conditions and limitations for the 
helicopter to meet  the airworthiness requirements21.  The FAA-approved flight manual  form ed 
part of the type approval certificate .  Any subsequent changes the FAA made to the  mandatory 
sections of the flight manual  (sections  2 - Limitations, 3  - Emergency Procedures , 4 - Normal 
Procedures and 5  - Performance) had to  be adopted by the  aviation authorities  in other 
countries .  If they were not adopted, the helicopter would not b e considered  airworthy  in that 
country . 
4.3.16.  When the R22 was first imported  to New Zealand , the CAA  accepted the foreign type 
certificate from the FAA, which is  now listed under Advisory Circular AC21 -1 Append ix 2.  This 
action made the FAA -approved flight manual  valid in New Zealand and obliged the CAA to 
adopt any future changes to the flight manual  in order  to retain compliance with the type 
certificate . 
4.3.17.  The FAA made a number of changes to the conditions for the R22 helicopter through its SFAR 
73 and ADs.  New Zealand broadly adopted these various changes through the equivalent 
instruments (see Appendix 5: History of airworthiness directives  and SFAR 73 in N ew Zealand  
for detail s of these historical changes ).  The U SA and New Zealand conditions for operating 
the R22 helicopter were broadly the same until 1998.  
4.3.18.  Post 1998 t here were 2 fundamental differences between how the FAA and the CAA regulated 
the special training and flight limitations for R22  and R44 pilots:  
 the FAA prohibited  inexperienced22 pilots from flying (manipulating the controls  of) R22 
helicopter s once wind speed and t urbulence reached certain levels, whereas the CAA 
allowed inexperienced pilots to fly the helicopter s in those conditions provided the pilot s-
in-comma nd (instructor s) were  experienced  
 in the U SA, R22 helicopter instructors had to be especially approved and endorsed by the 
FAA as being suitable to instruct on the helicopter, whereas in New Zealand there was no 
special requirement  other than that they must have completed the Robinson safety 
awareness training . 
The pilot-flying  
4.3.19.  Given the 0.5 -second time it cou ld take for a main rotor divergence to occur, the FAA was 
concerned that an instructor might not have time to prevent a trainee  pilot over-controlling the 
helicopter in response to turbulence.  To address this risk the FAA  prohibited  inexperienced 
pilots f rom manipulating the controls in turbulent  and windy conditions.  In New Zealand the 
restrictions were changed to apply  only to the pilot -in-command's experience, irrespective of 
who was manipulating the controls. (See Appendix 1 for more details .) 
                                                        
21 Code of Federal Regulation 14 CFR Part 27 and specified amendment status.  
22 The threshold between inexperienced and experienced was determined from accident data and is 
described in Appendix 4 . 
 
 
<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report 11 -003 4.3.20.  The New Zealand situation did not therefore address the FAA's concern about reaction time.  
An instructor can "guard " the cyclic control against over -controlling  by the trainee , but this can 
be challenging  because of the cyclic control desig n.  The cyclic control is pivoted on a central 
pedestal between the  pilots.  The pilot who is flying pull s their control handle down to a natural 
and comfortable flying position , which raises the other pilot's handle.  Robinson recommends 
that in turbulenc e the pilot steady  their right arm against their thigh .  This has the effect of 
further raising the cyclic control for the non -flying pilot  and, depending on the height of the 
pilot flying, putting it beyond comfortable reach (Figure 9). 
4.3.21.  The FAA prevent s inexperienced R22/R44 pilots acting as pilot s-in-command until they me et 
the minimum flight  experience.  It also provide s for an alternative path if their log book s are 
appropri ately endorsed and they undergo  annual flight reviews until they meet the minimum 
level of experience.  In New Zealand, R22/R44 pilots with less than the FAA minimum 
experience are not limited f rom acting as pilot s-in-command.  
4.3.22.  The FAA ha s set minimum flying time s under dual instruction  for trainee helicopter pilots 
wishing to convert to the R22 when they have only fixed -wing flying time s, or ratings on other 
helicopter types .  In New Zealand these either do not apply or are set at a lower limit . 
4.3.23.  The FA A requires that all Flight Reviews for pilots wishing to maintain R22 or R44 ratings be 
carried out in the relevant R22 or R44 helicopter s and only with approved R22 or R44 
instructor s.  This is to ensure that their safety awareness knowledge and skills ar e also 
current.  This requirement does not apply in New Zealand.  
The i nstructors  
4.3.24.  Instructor training  in the U SA has a separate line of quality control back to the FAA .  This has 
been  done  to ensure that safety awareness training is delivered in a consisten t manner , by 
instructors who have  demonstrated thorough knowledge of the R22 handling characteristics , 
and demonstrated they have the  skills to pass  this on through their instructional techniques.   
In New Zealand any category of helicopter instructor may provide the required safety 
awareness training for the R22 without any overall national quality control or oversight.  
4.3.25.  The Commission interviewed several experienced R22 instructors from New Zealand.  The 
Commission also  convened  an industry fact -finding panel discussion with a selected group of 
the most experienced R22 instructors in New Zealand .  The discussion revealed:  
 diversity in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and limitations  
 diversity in instructors' understanding of the theory behind the Robinson safety 
awareness training  
Figure 9  
R22 cyclic control  
 
Final Report 11 -003 |
<< Page 25 >>
  that t here was no national , standard training syllabus  for safety awareness training that 
instructors could  follow . 
4.3.26.  These findings are a serious  safety issue .  They show that safety awareness training and 
lessons from fatal accidents  caused by pilots exceeding the  limitations of the R22 helicopter 
have not been well conveyed to New Zealand's most experienced R22 helicopter instructor 
pilots.  The flow-on effect s to trainee  pilots, of whom some will be New Zealand's future 
instructors, mean s that the situation could get worse unless the CAA intervenes.   The 
Commission has recommended that the CAA address this safety issue . 
4.3.27.  Wanaka Helicopters held op erational certificates under 3 parts of the Civil Aviation  Rules: Part 
119 - Air Operator ; Part 135 - Air Operations, Helicopter and Small Aircraft; and Part 141 - 
Aviation Training Organisations. The CAA carried out regular audits for compliance with each  of 
these parts.  
4.3.28.  The operator had also developed its training systems to meet the New Zealand Qualifications 
Authority 's qualifications framework and was separately audited for compliance against its 
requirements.  
4.3.29.  The operator had systems in place to train  new pilots and review trainee s' progress amongst 
the instructor team. The CAA audits for the previous  2 years had not revealed any concerns 
and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority 's audit had commented favourably on the 
training systems and facilitie s in place.  No issues had been  found with the operator's 
management or operating systems.  
4.3.30.  The question then arises, why did the instructor on this occasion allow the helicopter  to enter 
an area of predictably  strong  turbulence at high altitude and with th e helicopter close to its 
maximum permissible weight?  
4.3.31.  The instructor may have been approaching Matukituki Saddle to test the weather conditions 
with the intention of "escaping " if they proved untenable.  He may have simply been caught 
unaware s by the ferocity of the wind and turbulence as he approached Waipara Saddle .  An 
instructor who fully understood the limitations of the R22 helicopter and who knew of the 
conditions ahead would have been less likely to attempt  this manoeuvre.   
Findings:  
4. The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe 
it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum  weight , and in 
conditions of moderate  to extreme  turbulence.  
5. The New Zealand regulatory over sight provide d insufficient guidance and mandatory 
requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 
helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations . 
 
Flight manual (clarity of safety -critical information)  
Safety issue - The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual  and the terminology it 
uses do not draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and conditions that could 
result in serious injury or death.  
4.3.32.  The flight manual contains the manufacturer's description of the helicopter 's performance, 
limitations, emergency procedures and systems.  It forms part of the type certification 
requirements and must be carried with the helicopter at all times.  This docu ment guides 
pilots on how to handle the helicopter safely and keep within the flight limitations defined by 
the manufacturer.  
4.3.33.  The "Limitations " section of the R22 flight manual is approved by the FAA to ensure a 
minimum standard .  The  other sections , such as the "Safety Notices " section , are provided by 
 
 
<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report 11 -003 the manufacturer for the benefit of pilots, owners and operators.  Some inconsistencies have 
evolved with the R22 flight manual over time as it has been amended  by the manufacturer , by 
the FAA  and, in New Ze aland's case, by the CAA.  
4.3.34.  Robinson Helicopter  Company  has developed a number of safety notices to assist pilots and 
warn them about identified hazards and safety -critical situations to be avoided.  Some of 
these safety -critical situations have been carried  forward to the mandatory "Limitations " 
section of the manual  - the section to which  all pilots must adhere.  However , others have not.  
4.3.35.  Robinson Helicopter Company has produced  safety notices (see Appendix 7: Relevant 
Robinson Helicopter Company R22 safety ) that explain the hazards of, and how to manage : 
 low-gravity manoeuvres (SN -11) 
 low-RPM main rotor stall (SN -24) 
 high winds and turbulence (SN-32). 
4.3.36.  The FAA's AD 95 -26-04, made in 1995 , limited the helicopter to 70%  of the maximum 
allowable airspeed (0.7 of Vne or about 71 knots) when turbulence was encountered23.  The 
R22 flight manual has been revised several times since 1995 , but by 2011 the "Limitations " 
section of the flight manual still did not mention any airspeed limit for the helicopter in 
turbulent and windy conditions .  Given the R22's susceptibility to in-flight break -ups from main 
rotor divergence in turbulent conditions, this matter should have been highlighted in the 
mandatory "Limitations " section of the ma nual.  Given that the pilots of small aircraft rarely 
check the content of a flight manual when flying, it would be a useful prompt for pilots to have 
this limitation marked on the airspeed indicator or prominently placarded in the cockpit.  
4.3.37.  Another safety issue arises over how Warnings, Cautions and Notes are referred to in the 
Robinson flight manual.  The FAA provide s an advisory circular for manufacturers that 
describes an acceptable means of compliance for the content and structure of the flight 
manual i n order to meet certification requirements24. 
4.3.38.  The advisory circular states that, "Warnings  should be used with respect to safety matters that 
are immediately imminent " and that "Cautions  should be used  for safety matters that are not 
imminent ".  Notes  refer  to important information that does not fit with in either of the other  2 
descriptions . These definition s are generally interpreted by aircraft manufacturers to mean 
that non -compliance with a Warning  could cause death or serious injury and non-compliance 
with a Caution  could cause damage to the aircraft.  
4.3.39.  The Robinson flight manual does not use the term "Warning ".  The term  "Caution " is us ed to 
describe actions that are likely to prove fatal  or cause damage to the helicopter.  Although 
these terms did not have the more commonly accepted industry interpretation s, they were not 
specifically defined in the manual until 2012 . For example the "Flight and manoeuvre 
limitations "25 section of the manual has a "Caution " at the top about low "G" conditions that it 
states, "... can result in catastrophic loss of lateral control".  This would normally be described 
as a "Warning " under the FAA guidelines because if the caution is not followed, a loss of 
lateral control would be immediately imminent and highly likely resul t in a fatal accident . 
4.3.40.  According to the CAA's aeronautical information publication , about 60% of New Zealand is  
designated as mountainous terrain, including most of the South Island.  Wind blowing across 
mountainous areas results in  turbulence  as it  is channelled through or over the terrain , 
causing sudden changes in wind speed and directio n.  R22 instructors and trainee pilots 
should be absolutely clear in their understanding of how hazardous it is to operate R22 
helicopter s in moderate to extreme  turbulence.  It is possible that the significance of this 
                                                        
23 The operator advised that this lower speed was related to the desire d lower power setting , which would 
have reduce d the risk of a right roll and potential mast bumping situation .

 information has been lost to the New Zealand Robinson helicopter pilot fraternity , through the 
dilution of the Robinson safety awareness training in New Zealand and the benign way in 
which critical s afety information has been presented in the flight manual.  
Finding : 
6. The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do 
not draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and situations that could 
result in serious injury or death.  
 
R22 safety performance (New Zealand)  
Safety issue  - The rate of R22 in -flight break -up accidents in New Zealand has not been 
significantly reduced by the New Zealand version of the FAA hazard mitigation measures 
intended to prevent such accidents.   
4.3.41.  The New Zealand R22 a ccident data  was analysed  and compared  with the U SA data to provide 
an indication  of how the different approaches taken by the FAA and the CAA had influenced 
the accident rate s in the respective countries. Four graphs are provided in Appendix 8  with a 
summary below .  
4.3.42.  Accident data was obtained from the FAA and the CAA.  The list s of fatal R22 accidents were 
reviewed from the pu blished accident briefs and categorised into 3 groups to represent 
accidents that were likely to be examples of the type s that the special safety awareness 
training26 was intended to prevent.  Each of t he 3  categories is shown  in a different colour in 
the graphs  in Appendix 8 .  The 3 categories are t hat the accident : 
 was caused by  an in -flight break -up of the helicopter  
 was caused when the main rotor speed decreased below acceptable 
limits (low main rotor RPM)  
 was caused by some other reason . such as pilot actions, collision with 
trees, heavy landing  or mechanical failure , and is therefor e not relevant  to 
this safety issue .   
4.3.43.  The number of fatal accidents in New Zealand and the USA related to in -flight break -up and 
low rotor RPM was counted from 1985 to 1998 , and compared with the number from 1999 to 
2012. These date ranges span ned 14 years and coincide d with both countr ies having the 
same conditions up to 1998 in relation to the SFAR 73 training requirements , but a diverging 
situation post 1998.  These numbers were divided by the average fleet size during the same 
periods to obtain an accident rate per operational helicopter , then normalised to represent 
accidents per 1000 registered aircraft.  
4.3.44.  The data does not show any low rotor RPM -type accidents  in New Zealand because the 
information available did not list these as having fatal results.   
4.3.45.  The U SA registration data is approximate because it is based on the number of R22s 
registered in September 2013 using the year s in which  they were manufactured. Seventy -
seven records from the FAA data did not contain values for the "year of manufacture ".  These 
records have been  excluded  but o ne was subsequently reused because the helicopter's serial 
number indicated it had been  built in 2 009 and otherwise there was no record for that year.    
4.3.46.  The available data did not include the average hours flown per aircraft per year, so the 
Commission  could not determine if there were significant differences in R22 operations 
between New Zealand and t he USA.  Consequently the exposure s to risk from the selected 
accident causes may differ.

 Final Report 11 -003 4.3.47.  For the purposes of comparison, this analysis assumes that flight hours per aircraft per year in 
the 2 countries were  broadly similar, and that aircraft use had stayed relatively constant 
during  the period. On this basis, the rate of fatal R22 accidents appear ed to have dropped 
during  the period examined by a considerably greater degree in the USA than it had in New 
Zealand.  
4.3.48.  In the U SA, the rate of fatal accidents  per 1000 register ed R22 aircraft dropped from 3.4  per 
year from 1985 to 1998 to 1.4  per year from 1999 to 2012 (a 59 % reduction). The 
corresponding figures in New Zealand were a drop from 4.5  fatal accidents per year from 
1985 to 1998 to 3.7 per year from  1999 to 2012 (a 17 % reduction ). 
 
4.3.49.  These figures indicate d low annual accident rates and did not provide a robust  basis for direct 
statistical  analysis between the 2 separate aeronautical jurisdictions .   
4.3.50.  The New Zealand accident rate has not trended downwards since the introduction of safety 
awareness training in 1995.   There appears to have been an initial reduction in R22 accidents  
post 1995 , but since  the CAA introduced  reduced safety awareness requirements in 1998,  
New Zealand has  had an average o f one R22 in -flight break -up accident every 18 months  
since  2002 .   
4.3.51.  These figures , together with the findings from the group discussion with senior R22 
instructors , highlights again the need for the CAA to intervene and raise awareness amongst 
pilots and helicopter training organisations of the  characteristics and limitations of the R22 
helicopter .  
Finding  
7. The rate of R22 in -flight break -up accident s in New Zealand has not been 
significantly reduced  by the New Zealand version of the FAA hazard mitigation 
measures  intended to prevent such accidents.

 4.4. Locating aircraft  
Emergency locator transmitters  (ELT)  
4.4.1.  The helicopter was fitted with a 406 -megahertz  ELT in accordance with New Zealand aviation 
rules .  This device is designed to activate  automatically  when  pre-set gravitational forces are 
exceeded . It can also be manually activated by the pilot using a remote switch.  
4.4.2.  Once activated , the ELT is designed to transmit  continually  2 separate radio sig nals 
sequentially until it exhausts the battery capacity or is turned off .  The first is a  low-power 
transmission intended as a homing signal .  The second  is a digital coded message transmitted 
to a geosynchronous satellite network to alert the relevant re scue co -ordination centre.  
4.4.3.  When the helicopter crashed, the ELT activated but was so severely damaged that it was 
unable to trans mit a useable location signal.  In this case , however, the flight tracking device 
installed on the helicopter had been transmit ting position reports to the operator's base, so 
when the helicopter was reported overdue search aircraft were directed immediately to the 
general area where the helicopter had crashed.  
4.4.4.  The failure of ELTs to function correctly after crash es is a common co ncern worldwide.   
Several investigations have been conducted into the performance of ELTs27. The International 
Civil Aviation Organization  and International Maritime Organization are actively seeking 
improvements in the c rash survivability of the transmitter s and for them to have  mandatory 
global positioning system  (GPS) capabilit ies. 
4.4.5.  All of the investigations concluded that insufficient accident data was being collected on ELT 
performance to make any meaningful recommendations.   
4.4.6.  The CAA carried o ut research into the use of ELTs and flight tracking devices in New Zealand 
and compared the effectiveness and installation requirements of both systems (CAA -1, 2010) .  
The report identified common issues with ELTs , including cr ash survivability and aerial 
disconnection failures.  It also reviewed data available from the CAA database about ELT s and 
acknowledged th at CAA records on ELT failures were unreliable.  
4.4.7.  In the absence of any other comparable system for locating aircraft fo llowing occurrence s, the 
CAA has continued,  and should continue , to support the International Civil Aviation 
Organization /International Maritime Organization  endeavours to improve the crash 
survivability of ELTs .  At the time of drafting this report, the C AA was continuing to address 
crash tolerance with ELT manufacturers and was working with Rescue Coordination Centre 
New Zealand to test an internally mounted aerial .  It had also issued an advisory circular (AC 
43-11) with details to improve the survivability of ELT aerials  and conducted  ongoing 
discussions with licensed engineers and operators.  No action had been taken towards 
improving CAA data collection on ELT su rvivability.  
Flight tracking devices  
4.4.8.  Separate flight tracking device s can be installed by operator s if desired.   Flight tracking 
devices are not a direct substitute for ELT s because they do not alert anyone that a crash has 
occurred.  They do , howeve r, provide a useful record of where an aircraft has been and its 
general location after an occurrence, as it did in this case.  
4.4.9.  The value of flight tracking devices and  the failure of ELTs became a discussion point after a 
Eurocopter EC120B ZK -HTF fatal accid ent near Raglan in 2005 (CAA -1, 2010) .  The coroner 
recommended that, " CAA immediately engage with representatives of the flight tracking device 
industry for the purposes of consultation to develop technical standards and minimum

 Final Report 11 -003 performance criteria for missing aircraft detection and location" (Matenga, 2010) .  At the time 
of drafting this report  the CAA was continuing to engage with New Zealand flight tracking 
device manufacturers .  
4.4.10.  Flight tra cking devices are still being installed under the classification of "portable electronic 
device s" and as "non-aeronautical avionics device s/system s".  The CAA has accepted these  
installations  due to the benefit s that flight tracking devices provide . 
4.4.11.  Opera tors should consider installing flight tracking devices on their aircraft because they  
improve the chances of aircraft being found as soon as possible following accident s, 
particularly in the event of ELT failure s. 
Finding s: 
8. A more crashworthy ELT would not have altered the outcome of this accident , because 
the crash was not survivable and the flight tracking de vice was able to guide search  
aircraft  to the general location of the crash site .  However, under different 
circumstances a more crashworthy ELT has the potential to save lives.  
9. The flight tracking device s in aircraft are a good enhancement for locating crashed and 
disabled aircraft, which means they have the potential to save lives . 
10. Improv ing the  crashworthiness of ELTs fitted to aircraft will impr ove flight safety by 
speeding up the search and first response to aircraft accidents.  The CAA should 
continue to support the international effort to improve standards for such devices.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The helicopter was operating in conditions of reduced power margin  where it was near  to the  
maximum allowable weight, and flying at relatively high altitude in strong wind and moderate 
to extreme turbulence , at the time it broke up in flight.  
5.2. The cause of the in -flight break -up was main rotor blade divergence caused by a possible 
combination of the following factors:  
 the helicopter entering low -gravity flight (more likely as a consequence of turbulence)  
 turbulence  
 excessive  movements  of the cyc lic control  
 low main rotor blade RPM .  
5.3. There was no evidence found that mechanical failure initiated the in -flight break -up, but the 
major damage to the engine and other components meant that the possibility of this could not 
be excluded.  
5.4. The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was 
to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of 
moderate to extreme  turbulence.  
5.5. The New Zealand regulatory oversight prov ided insufficient guidance and mandatory 
requirements for instructors, pilots and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 
helicopters to minimise the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations . 
5.6. The format of the Robinson R22 helicopter flight manual and the terminology it uses do not 
draw appropriate attention to safety -critical instructions and situations that could result in 
serious injury or death.  
5.7. The rate of R22 in -flight break -up accidents in New Zealand has not been  significantly  reduced 
by the New Zealand version of the FAA hazard mitigation measures intended to prevent such 
accidents.   
5.8. A more crashworthy ELT would not have altered the outcome of this accident , because the 
crash was not survivable and the flight tracking device was able to guide search aircraft to the 
general location of the crash site.  However, under different circumstances a more 
crashworthy ELT has the potential to save lives.  
5.9. The flight tracking devices in aircraft are a good enhancement for locating crashed  and 
disabled aircraft, which means they have the potential to save lives.   
5.10.  Improv ing the  crashworthiness of ELTs fitted to aircraft will improve flight safety by speeding 
up the search and first response to aircraft accidents.  The CAA should continue to  support the 
international effort to improve standards for such devices.

 Final Report 11 -003 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Comm ission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. No safety actions were identified.  
 
  
 
Final Report 11 -003 |
<< Page 33 >>
 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector .  In this case , recom mendations have been issued to the CAA. 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. Post 1998 t here were 2 fundamental differences between how the FAA and the CAA regulated 
the special safety awareness training and flight limitations for R22  and R44 pilots:  
 the FAA prohibited inexperienced pilots from flying R22 helicopter s once wind speed 
and turbulence reached certain levels, whereas the CAA allowed inexperienced pilots to 
fly the helicopter s in those conditions provided the pilot s-in-command (instructor s) were  
experienced  
 in the U SA, R22 helicopter instructors had to be e specially approved and endorsed by 
the FAA as being suitable to instruct on the helicopter, whereas in New Zealand there 
was no special requirement other than that they must have completed the Robinson 
safety awareness training.  
A discussion with senior New Zealand instructors on Robinson helicopters revealed that in 
New Zealand there was: 
 diversity in instructors' understanding of the R22 handling characteristics and 
limitations  
 diversity in instructors' understanding of the theory behind the Robinson safe ty 
awareness training  
 no national , standard training syllabus for  the safety awareness training that instructors 
could  follow . 
New Zealand's regulatory system has not properly publicised to the aviation industry the 
safety -critical limitations of the R22 h elicopter, and has not adequately controll ed the 
standard of instructor and pilot training in the way it has been  controlled  in the U SA, where the 
helicopter is manufactured.  
These findings show that safety awareness training and lessons from fatal accidents caused 
by pilots exceeding the limitations of the R22 helicopter have not been well conveyed to New 
Zealand's most experienced R22 helicopter instructor pilots.  The flow -on effect s to trainee  
pilots, of whom some will be New Zealand's future ins tructors, mean s that  the situation could 
get worse unless the CAA intervenes.  
On 26 February 2014  the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation:  
a. conduct a review of Robinson safety awareness training in New Zealand and facilitate the 
development and adoption of best practice across the sector , including a level of 
consistency in the way instructors deliver the safety awareness training  (003/14 ) 
b. review FAA SFAR 73 in the context of the New Zealand aviation system and adopt 
relevant improvements that would likely enhance  the operational safety of Robinson 
aircraft in New Zealand  (004/14 ). 
 
 
<< Page 34 >>
 Final Report 11 -003 On 5 March 2014 the CAA replied , in part : 
003/14 - the recommendations will be implemented in the form of a review by 
the Personal licencing  and Flight Training Unit, along with the Helicopter and 
Agricultural Operations Unit of the CAA.  The review is envisaged to take 
approximately 12 to 15 months to complete.  
004/14 - the recommendation will be implemented in the form of a review by 
the Hel icopter and Agricultural Operations Unit.  The review is envisaged to take 
approximately 12 to 15 months to complete.  
7.4. A more crashworthy ELT would not have altered the outcome of this accident , because the 
crash was not survivable and the flight tracking d evice was able to guide search aircraft to the 
general location of the crash site.  However, under different circumstances, a more 
crashworthy ELT has the potential to save lives.  
Improv ing the  crashworthiness of ELTs  fitted to aircraft will improve flight  safety by speeding 
up the search and first response to aircraft accidents.  The CAA should continue to support the 
international effort to improve standards for such devices.  
The flight tracking devices in aircraft are a good enhancement for locating cras hed and 
disabled aircraft, which means they have the potential to save lives.  The installation of these 
devices to compl ement ELTs should be encouraged.  
On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation:  
a. encourage the use of flight tracking devices, especially for use in aircraft operating in 
remote areas around New Zealand  (005/14 ) 
b. continue to support the international work underway to improve the crash survivability of 
ELTs  and to include GPS information  in the data transmitted by such devices  (006/14 ). 
On 5th March 2014, the CAA replied, in part:  
005/14 - In our draft recommendation response 31 January 2014, the Director 
commented that the CAA provide for the fitment of Flight Tracking Devices (FTDs) 
by operators and this can be achieved in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of AC 43 -14.  The CAA will co ntinue to encoura ge operators to fit FTDs in this 
manner.  The CAA considers the action sufficient to satisfy the closure of the 
Commission 's recommendation.  
006/14 - in the same response letter, the Director commented that the CAA 
already supports in prin ciple the ICAO and manufacturers' efforts to improve the 
crash survivability of ELTs and accurac y of position reporting.  The work is 
ongoing and in this context the CAA requests that the recommendation be 
closed.

 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Any aviation regulatory system must ensure that recommended and permissible maximum 
operating parameters for an aircraft type are clearly and consistently articulated to pilots, 
regardless of the country in which the aircraft is operated.  
8.2. Pilots must be fu lly aware of the operating limitations for aircraft they fly, and must always  stay 
within those limitations .

rotor  stalls and mast bumping.  
17 Mar 1995  AD 95 -04-14 
 
[Applies to

only. R44 not 
affected ] Formalises the priority letter but adds some minor 
changes to word ing. Intended to revise the operating 
limitation of the helicopter to a safer level and applies to 
all pilots.  Prohibited flight in the R22 helicopter when:  
 surface wind exceeds 25  knots or gust spread 
exceeds 15 knots  
 wind shear exists  
 moderate or worse turbulence is encountered.  
Limit s airspeed to between 60  knots and 0.7  Vne if 
inadvertently encountering turbulence.  
Adds to normal procedures ' description of M/R stall and 
mast bumping conditions and how to avoid. Recommends 
max Vne is 90% rated and avoid  flight at high -density 
altitudes, use max power -on at all times. Adds to 
emergency procedures with actions if experiencing low G 
or turbulence.  
25 Mar 1995  NZ CAA  
DCA/R22/27  AD 95 -04-14 is inserted directly into N ew Zealand  flight 
manual  for R22 and com pliance with " Limitations " section 
is mandatory.  
27 Mar 1995 to 
31 Dec 1997  SFAR 73  Establishes special training requirements for R22 and 
R44 pilots (Robinson safety awareness training ). Confirms 
that R22 is used for training and describes the hazards of 
low G and main rotor  stall. Justifies the requirement for an 
experience threshold for the Robinson pilots. Includes the 
following points : 
 no person may manipulate the controls  of an R22 
or R44 before completing Robinson safety 
awareness training . This also  applies to pilots with 
existing helicopter licences  
 describes the subject matter for the  Robinson 
safety awareness training  
 describes the requirements for instructors to be 
authorised to conduct Robinson safety awareness 
training.  
Additionally , no person may act as pilot-in-command  in an 
R22 unless that person has:  
 at least 200  hours' helicopter total time , of which 
at least 50 must be in the R22 , or 
 10 h ours' dual and endorsement from an 
authorised instructor that the pilot is proficient to 
act as pilot-in-command . In this case must also be 
subject to an annual flight review instead of 2

yearly until meets minimum experience limit.  
A person with a pilot's lice nce but not for rotorcraft must 
have a minimum of 20 h ours' dual in an R22 before going 
solo plus a log book endorsement from an appropriately 
rated instructor that the person is proficient to solo an 
R22. This endorsement only remains valid for 90 days.  
Robinson safety awareness training must be repeated 
every 2 years.  
Flight reviews must be carried out in the applicable R22 or 
R44 and include a review of the theory and practical skills 
central to the Robinson safety awareness training .

persons who seek to manipulate the controls or act as 
pilots-in-command of Rob inson R22 and R44 helicopter s. 
Repeats SFAR 73 in a clearer format and in addition to 
any existing Part 61 requirements.

must have also completed Rob inson safety awareness 
training.  
Repeat s the same conditions as previous AD for 
prohibiting flight when wind or turbulence is greater than 
specified limits , but now only applies to pilots with less 
than the minimum R22 experience.  The limits for high -
altitude flight and wind shear are removed.   
The new conditions for operations in wind or turbulence 
are highlighted in yellow.  
Unless the person manipulating the controls  in an R22 
has at least 200  hours' helicopter total time, of which at 
least 50 must be in the R22, they are prohibited from 
flying the R22 helicopter when:  
 surface wind exceeds 25  knots or 
 the gust spread exceeds 15  knots, and  
 if moderate turbulence or worse is encountered, 
continued flight is prohibited.  
All pilots must limit airspeed to between 60  knots and 0.7  
Vne if inadvertent ly encountering turbulence.  
Adds to normal procedures a description of main rotor  
stall and mast bumping conditions and how to avoid. The

avoidance actions are:  
1. Maintain cruise speed between 60  knots and less 
than 90% of rated Vne  
2. Use max power -on at all times during powered 
flight  
3. Avoid sideslip and maintain trimmed flight at all 
times  
4. Avoid large, rapid forward cyclic movements in 
forward flight and abrupt control inputs in 
turbulence  
Also a dds to the "Emergency" Procedures " a 
description of how to react to low  G and turbulence.  
16 Feb 1996  NZ CAA  
DCA/R22/27A  Revise s New Zealand  flight manual  for R22 by:  
 adding one page of CAA text to the "Limitations" 
section. Compliance mandatory  
 insert ing AD 95 -26-04 changes in the " Normal  
Procedures"  and "Emergency  Procedures"  
sections.  
31 Dec 1997 to  
31 Dec 2002  SFAR 73 -1 Clarifie s the previous version with replacement text after 
feedback and , as the FAA recognised that the R44 was 
more stable than the R22, experience in the R22 can be 
credited towards the minimu m requirement for the R44.  
Extend s the SFAR  73 validity to 2002.  
28 Aug 1998  NZ CAA  
DCA/R22/27B  Revise s New Zealand  flight manual  for R22 by:

31 Mar 2008  SFAR 73 -1 FFA c onsider s feedback from industry on several points.  
1. Should the R44 be excluded? No , it must remain 
covered by this SFAR . 
2. Should fl ight training be allowed for ab -initio pilots 
before completing Robinson safety awareness 
training? No , decided that continuous awareness 
training was preferable as the student was able to 
absorb it.  
3. Should the annual flight review be extended to 
the normal 2 years? No, it is to remain at one year 
as described in the SFAR  73 for pilots with 
experience less than the minimum level.  
4. Should the 200 -hour limit be reduced to 150? No . 
5. Should the life of this SFAR only be extended 2

29 Jun 2009  
Permanent  SFAR 73 -2 FAA r eviewed the NTSB  accident data between 2005 and 
2008 and found there were nearly 4 times more 
R22s/R44 s in operation compared with other 2 -bladed 
light helicopters.  When compared on a per 100  000 
hours of flight time, the accident rate for the R22/R44 is 
10.48 compared with 7.44 for the other types taken as a 
group, therefor justifying continuing with the Robinson 
safety awareness training  as required under SFAR 73.  
Decided to make SFAR 73 permanent.  
The regulation was reformatted with clearer presentation 
and readability .
