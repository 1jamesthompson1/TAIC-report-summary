- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The instructor on board the helicopter was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence (4.3.4, 4.3.30, 4.3.31). This indicates a potential lack of training and competency in understanding the limitations of the helicopter under such conditions.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment

- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The New Zealand regulatory oversight provided insufficient guidance and mandatory requirements for instructors, pilots, and operators of the Robinson type R22 and R44 helicopters to minimize the known risk of exceeding the helicopters' limitations (4.3.5, 4.3.18, 4.3.25). This suggests issues with the organizational safety culture that could have contributed to the accident.

- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The instructor was possibly unaware of how critical and unsafe it was to fly the R22 helicopter at high altitude, at near maximum weight, and in conditions of moderate to extreme turbulence (4.3.4, 4.3.30, 4.3.31). This indicates a lack of situational awareness regarding the environmental conditions and the helicopter's limitations.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 40
  explanation: The helicopter was operating in conditions of reduced power margin where it was near to the maximum allowable weight, and flying at relatively high altitude in strong wind and moderate to extreme turbulence, at the time it broke up in flight (5.1). Weather conditions and decision making were significant contributing factors to the accident.
