- name: FADEC System Malfunction and Pilot Response
  explanation: The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system malfunction is a central safety theme in this accident. The FADEC system experienced an intermittent fault that resulted in a loss of automatic governing of the engine power ("An intermittent fault in the 'full authority digital engine control' (FADEC) system almost certainly resulted in a loss of automatic governing of the engine power" (4.1)). The pilot did not switch the FADEC system to manual mode, which could have allowed for control of the engine power during the forced landing ("The pilot did not switch the FADEC system to manual mode" (4.3)). This theme is relevant because the malfunction of the FADEC system and the pilot's subsequent actions directly contributed to the inability to control the engine power, leading to a heavy landing and severe injuries to the occupants.
- name: Training and Knowledge of Emergency Procedures
  explanation: The theme of training and knowledge of emergency procedures is highlighted by the pilot's lack of understanding of the FADEC system and the prescribed responses to various malfunctions. The pilot expressed reluctance to use the manual mode in flight and could not describe its operation correctly ("The pilot expressed a reluctance to use the manual mode in flight and could not describe its operation correctly" (3.59)). Additionally, the pilot's written examination for the MD 600N type rating did not mention the correct actions required involving the auto/manual switch or the use of manual throttle control in the specified situation ("The pilot's written answer had made no mention of the correct actions required involving the auto/manual switch or the use of manual throttle control in the specified situation" (3.61)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that the pilot's training may not have adequately prepared them to handle the FADEC system malfunction, which was a contributing factor in the accident.
- name: Availability of Training Resources
  explanation: The availability of training resources is a safety theme related to this accident. The helicopter manufacturer did not provide information to assist instructors in training for flying in manual mode, which is a proprietary procedure not available outside the manufacturer's own training organization ("the helicopter manufacturer did not provide information to assist instructors in training for flying in manual mode" (3.70)). This lack of available training resources may have contributed to the pilot's reluctance to use manual mode and the misunderstanding of when its use would be appropriate, which is significant given the role of the FADEC system malfunction in the accident.
- name: Use of Helmets
  explanation: The use of helmets is a safety theme that, while not directly contributing to the accident, is related to the severity of the injuries sustained by the occupants. Neither the pilot nor any of the occupants were wearing helmets during the accident flight, and there was no Civil Aviation Rule to mandate the wearing of helmets ("Neither the pilot nor any of the occupants were wearing helmets on the accident flight" (3.82)). Research has documented the benefits of wearing helmets on board helicopters to prevent head injuries, especially for pilots during occurrence events when they need to maintain awareness and act quickly ("A significant amount of research exists on the benefits of aircraft occupants wearing appropriate helmets" (3.84)). This theme is relevant as it addresses the potential for mitigating injury severity in accidents.
- name: Pilot's Experience with Non-FADEC Engine Variants
  explanation: The pilot's experience with non-FADEC engine variants is a safety theme that may have influenced their response to the FADEC system malfunction. The pilot had significantly more experience flying other light helicopters powered by non-FADEC variants of the RR-250 engine and reduced the throttle on the collective twistgrip during the accident flight, which was the prescribed procedure for a fuel control system malfunction resulting in a high rotor RPM with the non-FADEC RR-250 engine variants ("The pilot of the accident flight had significantly more experience in flying other light helicopters powered by non-FADEC variants of the RR-250 engine" (3.65)). This theme is relevant as it suggests that the pilot's prior experience may have affected their decision-making during the emergency, potentially leading to actions that were not appropriate for the FADEC-equipped helicopter involved in the accident.
- name: Inattentional Blindness and Pilot Workload
  explanation: Inattentional blindness and pilot workload is a safety theme that considers the pilot's mental state and situational awareness during the accident. Studies have identified that during times of high mental workload, cognitive resources can fail to register information that is not subconsciously deemed a priority ("studies on the topic of inattentional blindness have identified that during times of high mental workload, cognitive resources can reach a saturation point and fail to register information that is not subconsciously deemed a priority" (3.47 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Although the reversionary governor took control during a phase of flight coinciding with a comparatively low mental-workload requirement, it is unclear if the pilot suffered from inattentional blindness or if the caution and warning lights had illuminated ("On the accident flight the reversionary governor took control during a phase of flight coinciding with a comparatively low mental-workload requirement" (3.48)). This theme is relevant as it explores the human factors that may have affected the pilot's ability to respond effectively to the emergency.
