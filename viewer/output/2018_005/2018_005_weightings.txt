","0.0","5.0","The pilot's incorrect actions and assumptions regarding the operation of the FADEC system and the manual mode indicate human error as a contributing factor (3.59, 3.60).
","0.0","20.0","The pilot's misunderstanding of aspects of the FADEC system and emergency procedures contributed to the accident. The pilot did not correctly describe some aspects of the MD 600N FADEC system and the prescribed responses to various malfunctions, indicating inadequate training and competency (3.58, 3.59, 3.61). The pilot's reluctance to use manual mode in flight and misunderstanding of when its use would be appropriate also played a role (3.60). The pilot's written examination answer regarding the 'ECU fail' light was marked as incorrect, and no correction was annotated by the instructor, suggesting gaps in the training process (3.62).
","0.0","20.0","The pilot's lack of familiarity with the FADEC system's manual mode and the absence of appropriate means for pilots to gain experience in matching throttle position and required engine speed when transitioning to manual mode were significant factors (3.66, 3.67, 3.70). The reluctance of the instructor to practice the use of manual mode during training due to perceived risks contributed to the pilot's lack of familiarity with this critical aspect of the equipment (3.73, 3.74).
","0.0","0.0","There is insufficient information to determine the role of crew resource management in the accident.
","0.0","15.0","The pilot did not switch the FADEC system to manual mode as prescribed in the flight manual, which could have allowed for controlled flight to a suitable landing site (3.55). This lack of adherence to safety procedures contributed to the severity of the accident.
","0.0","13.333","The operator did not have a formal policy on the wearing of helmets, which increased the risk of injury (3.82). This indicates a lack of emphasis on safety culture within the organization, as a strong safety culture would have policies in place to manage risks related to head injury (3.84).
","2.887","5.0","The intermittent nature of the FADEC system fault and the difficulty in performing fault diagnosis using the flashing light method suggest that risk management and analysis processes were not effective in identifying and mitigating this recurring issue (4.2).
","0.0","1.667","The lack of regulatory requirements for the wearing of helmets and the absence of a formal policy by the operator suggest issues with regulatory oversight and compliance in terms of safety equipment usage (3.82).
","2.887","1.667","There is insufficient information to determine the role of situational awareness in the accident.
","2.887","10.0","The pilot's response to the FADEC system transitioning to fuel flow fixed mode was not in line with emergency response procedures, which would have involved selecting manual mode and reconfiguring the helicopter (3.54). This indicates a lack of preparedness for such an emergency situation.
","0.0","1.667","There is insufficient information to determine the role of maintenance and inspection regimes in the accident.
","2.887","6.667","The reliance on the FADEC system without proper understanding or monitoring by the pilot, and the subsequent failure to take manual control when necessary, indicates an over-reliance on automation (4.1).
