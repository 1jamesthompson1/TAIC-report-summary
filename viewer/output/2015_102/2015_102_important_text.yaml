  \  \n4.1.1.  The electric locomotive fleet had been operating between Palmerston\
  \ North and Hamilton on \nthe North Island Main Trunk line for about 30 years. \
  \ There had been three previous high -\nvoltage cable failures  recorded , none\
  \ of which resulted in a fire.   \n4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses what\
  \ led to the fire within the transformer compartment.  \n4.1.3.  The investigation\
  \ identified three  safety issues that , when addressed , will help to prevent a\
  \ \nreoccurrence and improve the safety  of both staff and any passengers in a similar\
  \ event : \n\uF0B7 the high-voltage  cable assembly had been in service for less\
  \ than 12 months , but the \nrecords available did not show if it was new or re-purposed8,\
  \ or detail the results of any \ntest(s) performed on the cable  assembly to ensure\
  \  that it was in serviceable condition  \n\uF0B7 the operating procedures and training\
  \  given to train crews to respond effectively in the \nevent of a fire on a train\
  \  were inconsistent  across New Zealand's main rail operators  \n\uF0B7 the Natioinal\
  \ Rail System Standards  has no minimum standards for fire detection  or \nsuppression\
  \ systems on the New Zeal and rail network .  \n4.2. What caused the fire  \n4.2.1.\
  \  The damage caused by the fire was contained within the transformer compartment\
  \ .  \nCommission investigators , assisted by Kiw iRail's high voltage expert ,\
  \ remove d and inspect ed \nthe high-voltage  plug that had been identified  as\
  \ the source of the fire  (see Figure 8) . \n \nFigure 8 \nHigh -voltage  cable\
  \ plug  removed from EF30157 transformer h ousing  \nPicture 1 - the cable plug\
  \ assembly  from EF30157  \nPicture 2 - the end cap was forced off the end of the\
  \ plug assembly  \nPicture 3 - an exhaust vent hole formed through the cable from\
  \ within the plug  \n4.2.2.  An inspection of the high-voltage  cable plug showed\
  \ that the insulation had failed  within the \nplug (see Figur e 9 for cross -section\
  \ detai l).  The breakdown of  the insulation allowed a short to \nearth, causing\
  \ an explosion that distorted the cable plug and started the fire.  This happened\
  \  \n                                                        \n8 A 'repurposed'\
  \ item is o ne that has been used in service before being removed and put into stock\
  \ as an \navailable spare.  \n\nFinal report RO -2015 -102 \n<< Page 11 >>\n shortly\
  \  after the locomotive had been parked on the electric departure road , when it\
  \ was \nstationary and u nder no electrical load .  \n  \nFigure 9 \nThe high-voltage\
  \  cable socket and plug assembly  \n4.2.3.  An inspection of the  high-voltage\
  \  cable plug showed evidence of expansion in all directions  \ndue to an explosion\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 an explosive gas vent had occurred through the plug 's copper earth\
  \ screen just above \nthe plug assembly .  It had  melted several strands of the\
  \ earth and armour braid and \nexited  through the rubber outer  sheath  (see Figure\
  \ 10)  \n\uF0B7 the plug's insulating  hard shell  was burnt near the upper flange\
  \ and the outer surface \nwas distorted.  The insulating pitch inside it  had expanded\
  \ and forced the end cap off \n(see Fig ure 10) \n\uF0B7 the pressure build -up\
  \ inside the oil-filled socket had breached the gasket seal between \nthe cable\
  \ plug flange and the transformer housing through an arc of approximately 60\xB0\
  \ \n(see Figure 11).  The damaged gasket section allowed transformer oil to be forced\
  \ out \nthrough the broken seal.   \n \n\n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2015\
  \ -102  \nFigure 10 \nDiagram of cable failure  \n \n \nFigure 11 \nDamaged gasket\
  \ between cab le socket and oil-filled  socket   \n \n4.2.4.  The explosion caused\
  \ by the high-voltage  cable plug failure simultaneously expanded the high-\nvoltage\
  \  plug and forced oil out of the socket and ignited it .  It also  caused the \
  \ electrical \nprotection breakers on the locomotive to trip.   \n4.2.5.  The oil\
  \ socket was designed so that any leakage of oil was automatically topped u p by\
  \ a \ngravity feed from a multipurpose 3,000-litre oil reservoir.  Once the oil\
  \ had been ignited the \nfire receiv ed a constant supply of oil that fuelled the\
  \ fire .   \n\nFinal report RO -2015 -102 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2.6.  The maintenance\
  \  shut-off valve  was inaccessible  and the oil supply could not be isolated  due\
  \ \nto its close proximity to the seat of the fire .  This constant supply of fuel\
  \ to the fire contributed \nto the difficulties faced by firefighters  attempting\
  \ to  extinguish the fire.  \n4.2.7.  Although the oil could not be isolated, the\
  \ fire was contained within t he transformer \ncompartment by the fire bulkheads\
  \ , as intended in the original design.  \nFinding s  \n1. A failure of the  high-voltage\
  \  cable plug insulation caused an explosion in the \nhigh-voltage  cable plug and\
  \ socket, releasing and igniting transformer oil.  \n2. The fire was sustained by\
  \  a constant supply of fuel from a  3,000-litre oil \nreservoir , as the maintenance\
  \ shut -off valve  could not be isolated  due to its \ninaccessibility and close\
  \ proximity to the seat of the fire .  However, the fire \nwas contained within\
  \ the tr ansformer compartment by the fire bulkheads . \n \n4.3. Cable assembly\
  \ failure  \nSafety issue - the high -voltage cable assembly had been in service\
  \ for less than 12 months , \nbut the records available did not show if it was new\
  \ or repurposed , or detail the results of any \ntest(s) performed on the cable\
  \ assembly to ensure that it was in serviceable condition . \n4.3.1.  KiwiRail obtain\
  \ s electric locomotive high-voltage  cable  assemblie s from the original  \nmanufacturer\
  \ of the locomotive, Brush Electric UK, which in turn source s them  from a  \n\
  specialist external supplier.  The cable  that failed  had been manufactured to\
  \ a British Rail \nstandard.  Brush Electric UK was not aware of any similar  cable\
  \ failures on its locomotives that \nhad resulted in a fire.    \n4.3.2.  A high-voltage\
  \  cable assembly failure had occurred on this locomotive within the previous  12\
  \ \nmonths.  The cable assembly had been  replaced  from KiwiRail stock,  but from\
  \ the records \navailable it was not possible to  determine whether the replacement\
  \ cable assembly was a new \nor 'repurposed ' unit.   \n4.3.3.  The high-voltage\
  \  cable assembly had, however, been subjected to a standard KiwiRail 5,000 -\n\
  volt insulation integrity test, which it passed.  This insulation integrity test\
  \ was not \nrepresentative of the 25,000 -volt in-service conditions , but it was\
  \ considered by KiwiRail  to be \na suitable and practical compromise test once\
  \ the cable had been installed . \n4.3.4.  The condition of the replacement cable\
  \ assembly when installed in January 2015 was \ndetermined by KiwiRail to be fit\
  \ for purpose, but the  reason for its subsequent premature \nfailure is not clear\
  \ . \n4.3.5.  It is essential that safety -critical components , which may include\
  \  high-voltage  cables, are \nproperly identified and documented , and that detailed\
  \ in-service maintenance records are \nkept.   \n4.3.6.  A recommendation was made\
  \ by the Commission in report R02013 -104 for KiwiRail to \naddress a similar issue\
  \ after the derailment of a metro passenger train  in Wellington  on 20 \nMay 2013.\
  \   The Commission recommended th at KiwiRail  ensure that maintenance work \ncarried\
  \ out at its depots  is undertaken in accordance with good railway engineering practice\
  \ , \nsafety -critical components are identified and documented , and all maintenance\
  \ work is \nrecorded  in detail .  \n4.3.7.  The Commission has made a recommendati\
  \ on to the Chief E xecutive of the NZ Transport \nAgency to address this safety\
  \ issue.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report RO -2015 -102 Finding s  \n3. KiwiRail's\
  \ maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering \npractice, as the available\
  \ service records did not show whether the high-\nvoltage  cable assembly  that\
  \ had been in service for about 10 months was \nfitted new or repurposed , or record\
  \  the results of any tests performed on the \ncable . \n \n \n \n4.4. Fire preparedness\
  \  of New Zealand rail operators on the controlled network  \nSafety issue - the\
  \ operating procedures and  training given to train crews to respond \neffectively\
  \ in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main\
  \ rail \noperators . \n4.4.1.  The locomotive fire occurred within a major freight\
  \ terminal  with good road access.  KiwiRail \nstaff were able to provide  expert\
  \ knowledge regarding specific hazards . Other locomotives of \nthe same class were\
  \ close by and available to the Fire Service to confirm  the internal layout.  \n\
  This assisted the Fire Service in fighting the fire ; however , had it occurred\
  \ away from a depot  \nthe circumstances may have been more difficult . \n4.4.2.\
  \  When the Fire Service arrived  at the scene , vital time was lost whilst the\
  \ firefighters  were \nfamiliarised with the locomotive.  T hey had no locomotive\
  \ -specific information with respect to \nthe: \n\uF0B7 hazards on board the specific\
  \ locomotive class  \n\uF0B7 internal layout of the vehicle and the locations of\
  \ any isolation valves  \n\uF0B7 methods  for fighting the fire  specific to this\
  \ locomotive class . \nHad there been locomotive -class -specific details readily\
  \ available to the Fire Service , the fire  \nmight have been extinguished more\
  \ quickly . \n4.4.3.  When the high-voltage  cable plug failure occurred , the on\
  \ -board circuit breakers tripped as \ndesigned and the overhead power supply to\
  \ the locomotive was isolated.  However, unaware \nof this and without any formal\
  \ fire training, a KiwiRail maintenance engineer used his best \njudgement and boarded\
  \ the locomotive to a ctivate the 'emergency pantograph down' button \nin the driver\
  \ 's cab before the Fire Service arrived.  Despite his best intentions, i n doing\
  \ so he  \npotentially  exposed himself to unnecessary danger and potential ly harmful\
  \ fumes inside the \nlocomotive .  This may have been avoided if clear procedures\
  \ or guidelines for action in the \nevent of a fire had been available . \n4.4.4.\
  \  Neither the driver nor the pilot of locomotive EF30157 had received any training\
  \ in the use of \nthe fire extinguishers fitted to their locomotive or the actions\
  \ to take in the event of a fire.  \n4.4.5.  The Commission found that there was\
  \ a range of documented fire policies, p rocedures and \nguidelines provided by\
  \  New Zealand's main rail passenger operators.  The procedures ranged \nfrom being\
  \ very  detailed to just instructing staff to use their best judgement.  T here\
  \ was no \nconsistent approach to training drivers and crew on the actions to take\
  \ in the event  of a fire.  A \nrecommendation to address this issue has been made\
  \ to the Chief Executive of the NZ \nTransport Age ncy.  \n4.4.6.  KiwiRail's current\
  \ safety case lodged with the NZ Transport Agency  does not mention fire risk \n\
  or any related topics.    \nFinal report RO -2015 -102 \n<< Page 15 >>\n Finding\
  \ s  \n4. There are inconsistent  levels of fire management documentation and \n\
  training  in place across New Zealand's major rail passenger  operators .   \n5.\
  \ KiwiRail relied on the best judgement  of locomotive staff for dealing with the\
  \ \nlocomotive fire rather than providing documentation and training . \n6. The\
  \ firefighting effort was delayed due to the need to obtain information on \nthe\
  \ specifi c locomotive and associated hazards .  \n7. The Fire Service obtained\
  \ information that was critical for the firefighting \neffort  that may not have\
  \ been available had the fire  occurred away from a \ndepot .  \n \n4.5. Comp aring\
  \ the New Zealand  locomotive fleet fire standard to best practice  \nSafety issue\
  \ - the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire \n\
  detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains  on\
  \ the New \nZealand rail network .  \n4.5.1.  The Commission sought to ascertain\
  \ international  best practice in terms of fire detection and \nsuppression systems\
  \  within the rail industry.  The European standard  EN 45545 - Fire \nProtection\
  \ on Railway Vehicles  and t he Australian standard  AS 7529 - Railway Rolling Stock\
  \ - \nFire Safety , which makes reference to EN  45545 , both define the minimum\
  \ standard for \nlocomotive fire protection to be:  \n\uF0B7 freight (diesel electric\
  \ or electric ) - fire detection  systems  \n\uF0B7 passenger (diesel electric)\
  \ - fire detection and fire suppression  systems  \n\uF0B7 passenger (electric )\
  \ - fire detection systems and the use of fire-retardant materials . \n4.5.2.  Neither\
  \ of the se international standards has been formally adopted in New Zealand  as\
  \ there is \nno clear mechanism to do this , and as a result there is no requirement\
  \ for the fitting of fire \ndetection and suppression systems in New Zealand  locomotives\
  \ .  Where operators ' policies do \nexist and such systems have been fitted , there\
  \ is inconsisten t adoption  between operators  on \nthe controlled network  (see\
  \ Appendix 3) . \n4.5.3.  In the case of this locomotive , had fire detection been\
  \ fitted and activated , a quicker response \nto the fire may have resulted .  \
  \ \n4.5.4.  The Commission sought details of the status of the locomotive fire detection\
  \ and suppression \nsystems of the larger rail passenger operators within  New Zealand.\
  \  It compared  those of  four \nNew Zealand rail owners /operators : KiwiRail,\
  \ Auckland Transport, Greater Wellington Regional \nCouncil  and Dunedin Rail with\
  \ the international standards  EN 45545 and AS  7529 . \n4.5.5.  The comparison\
  \  exclude d (see Appendix 3 fo r comparison detail s): \n\uF0B7 locomotive s that\
  \ had been  mothballed or had life expectanc ies of less than two years  \n\uF0B7\
  \ locomotives used for shunting operations only, due to their being low risk  and\
  \ non-\nmainline operations . \n4.5.6.  Overall , only 48 out of a total 286 locomotives\
  \  (see Appendix 3) , or 16% , did not meet the \nminimum requirements of the  international\
  \ standards .  A breakdown of  this by \nowner /operator  and function  shows  (see\
  \ Figure 12 ): \n\uF0B7 KiwiRail - freight - 31 out of 111 locomotives , or 28%\
  \  \n\uF0B7 KiwiRail - passenger - three  out of 12 locomotives , or 25%  \n\uF0B7\
  \ Auckland Transport - passenger - 10 out of 67 locomotives , or 15 % \n\n<< Page\

  \ , or 30% . \nThe owner s/operators  of the se locomotives have plans in place\
  \ to  address  some of the \nshortfalls.   An economic solution for the remaining\
  \ locomotives  is under consideration . \n \nFigure 12 \nPercentage  of operators\

  \ no consistency across the different \noperators .  Adopting or developing a  New\
