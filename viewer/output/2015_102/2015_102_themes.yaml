- name: High-Voltage Cable Assembly Management
  explanation: The management of the high-voltage cable assembly is a critical safety theme as it directly contributed to the accident. The cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months, but the records did not clarify if it was new or repurposed, nor did they detail the results of any tests performed to ensure its serviceability. This lack of clear documentation and testing is a significant safety issue because it means that potentially faulty or unsuitable equipment could be in use without adequate checks, as evidenced by the failure of the cable's insulation leading to an explosion and fire ("the high-voltage cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months, but the records available did not show if it was new or repurposed" (4.3), "A failure of the high-voltage cable plug insulation caused an explosion in the high-voltage cable plug and socket" (5.1)).
- name: Fire Preparedness and Response Training
  explanation: Fire preparedness and response training is a safety theme that was found lacking and inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators. The report highlights that the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire were inconsistent, which could lead to inadequate responses in emergency situations. This is relevant to the accident as the crew did not have clear procedures or guidelines for action in the event of a fire, potentially putting themselves and others at risk ("the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators" (4.1.3), "Neither the driver nor the pilot of locomotive EF30157 had received any training in the use of the fire extinguishers fitted to their locomotive or the actions to take in the event of a fire" (4.4.4)).
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Standards
  explanation: The absence of national standards for fire detection and suppression systems on the New Zealand rail network is a significant safety theme. The report indicates that there are no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems, which means that there is no consistent approach to managing fire risks across the sector. This is relevant to the accident as the lack of such systems may have delayed the response to the fire, and a quicker response could have potentially mitigated the severity of the incident ("the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains on the New Zealand rail network" (4.5), "had fire detection been fitted and activated, a quicker response to the fire may have resulted" (4.5.3)).
- name: Maintenance Record Keeping
  explanation: Maintenance record keeping is a safety theme that reflects on the organizational practices regarding the documentation of equipment servicing and testing. The report found that KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice, as it failed to show whether the high-voltage cable assembly was new or repurposed and did not record test results. This is relevant to the accident because accurate and detailed maintenance records are essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of critical components, and the lack of such records was a contributing factor to the incident ("KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice, as the available service records did not show whether the high-voltage cable assembly that had been in service for about 10 months was fitted new or repurposed" (5.3)).
- name: Accessibility of Safety Equipment
  explanation: The accessibility of safety equipment, such as maintenance shut-off valves, is a safety theme that has direct implications for emergency response effectiveness. In the incident, the maintenance shut-off valve was inaccessible, preventing the isolation of the oil supply and contributing to the difficulty in extinguishing the fire. This highlights the importance of designing and maintaining equipment in a way that ensures it can be safely accessed and operated during emergencies ("The maintenance shut-off valve was inaccessible and the oil supply could not be isolated due to its close proximity to the seat of the fire" (4.2.6)).
- name: Information Availability for Emergency Services
  explanation: The availability of specific information for emergency services is a safety theme that affects the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response. During the incident, firefighters lost vital time as they were not familiar with the locomotive and lacked specific information regarding hazards, layout, and isolation valves. This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for readily available, locomotive-class-specific details that could expedite emergency response and potentially reduce the impact of such incidents ("When the Fire Service arrived at the scene, vital time was lost whilst the firefighters were familiarised with the locomotive" (4.4.2)).
