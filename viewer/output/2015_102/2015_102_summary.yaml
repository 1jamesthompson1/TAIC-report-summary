- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The report identifies that "the operating procedures and training given to train crews to respond effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail operators" (4.1.3). Furthermore, neither the driver nor the pilot of the locomotive had received any training in the use of the fire extinguishers or the actions to take in the event of a fire (4.4.4). This lack of training and competency in emergency response contributed to the severity of the incident.
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The high-voltage cable assembly that failed had been in service for less than 12 months, and the records did not show if it was new or repurposed, nor did they detail the results of any tests performed on the cable assembly to ensure that it was in serviceable condition (4.3). Additionally, KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice (4.3.3, 4.3.7). The failure of the high-voltage cable plug insulation was the initiating event that caused the explosion and subsequent fire (5.1), indicating that maintenance and inspection regimes were a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report does not provide explicit evidence of non-adherence to safety procedures as a contributing factor to the accident. However, the lack of detailed maintenance records (4.3.7) and the absence of a national fire detection and suppression system standard (4.5.7) suggest that there may have been gaps in following best practices and safety procedures, which could have mitigated the risk or severity of the fire.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report indicates that KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering practice (4.3.7), and KiwiRail relied on the best judgement of locomotive staff for dealing with the locomotive fire rather than providing documentation and training (5.5). This points to a potential issue with the organizational safety culture, as there seems to be a lack of emphasis on detailed documentation, training, and preparedness for emergency situations.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The absence of a national standard for fire detection and suppression systems in New Zealand (4.5.7) indicates a gap in regulatory oversight and compliance. This lack of regulation may have contributed to the severity of the fire, as there were no minimum standards in place to ensure the presence of such systems on the locomotive.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The firefighting effort was delayed due to the need to obtain information on the specific locomotive and associated hazards (5.6). Additionally, the fire was sustained by a constant supply of fuel from a 3,000-litre oil reservoir, as the maintenance shut-off valve could not be isolated due to its inaccessibility and close proximity to the seat of the fire (5.2). These factors indicate that emergency response preparedness was lacking, which contributed to the difficulty in extinguishing the fire.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the report does not explicitly attribute the cause of the accident to human error or assumptions, the lack of training and the reliance on staff's best judgement (5.5) suggest that human factors played a role in the response to the accident. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that human error or assumptions were a direct cause of the initial incident.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The report indicates that the driver and pilot were not trained in the use of fire extinguishers or in actions to take in the event of a fire (4.4.4). This lack of familiarity with emergency equipment and procedures likely affected the initial response to the fire.
