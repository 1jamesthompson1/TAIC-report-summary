The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used  to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendat ion must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive  summary  
1.1. On Tuesday 24 November 2015 at about 1830, a KiwiRail Holdings Limited (KiwiRail) light 
freight locomotive (EF30157) caught fire while parked at the Palmerston North rail depot.  
1.2. The Fire Service attended, but the fire was not extinguished until later that evening at 2023.  
The locomotive's transformer compartment suffered fire damage.  No -one was injured during 
the incident.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the seat of the fire 
was located where the high -volta ge cable, used to transmit power from the overhead power 
line to the locomotive, was connected into the transformer using a plug and socket 
arrangement.  The socket was filled with oil to insulate the high -voltage cable plug.  
1.4. The cause of the fire was attr ibuted to a failure in the insulation of the high -voltage cable  plug.  
A subsequent short circuit caused an explosion in the oil -filled socket and ignited the oil.  The 
resulting fire was fed by a constant supply of oil from a 3 ,000-litre reservoir that co uld not be 
isolated  due to the maintenance shut -off valve 's close proximity to the seat of the fire . 
1.5. The Commission found that: 
 no fire detection and suppression system standards have been adopted across the New 
Zealand rail sector  
 the operator of the locomotive relied on its staff to apply best judgement when dealing 
with fires rather than providing specific documentation and training  
 from the maintenance records available it was not possible to determine if the failed 
cable was new or  second -hand  
 the 5,000-volt insulation integrity test carried out on the high-voltage cable assembly  was 
not representative of the 25,000 -volt in -service conditions . 
1.6. The Commission is recommend ing that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency : 
 ensure that in their safety cases the access provider of, and operators using, the 
National Rail System consider fire in rail vehicles as a risk to the safety of their 
operations, and must demonstrate that they have mitigated that risk as far as 
reasona bly practicable  
 when conducting safety assessments of each rail licence holder, ensure that they 
have identified and assessed the risk of fire in a rail vehicle. The Chief Executive 
should ensure that they have, as far as reasonably practicable, minimised t he risk 
and have measures in place to deal with the outbreak of, and reactions to, fire events  
 when conducting safety assessments of each rail licence holder operating on the 
National Rail System, ensure that systems are in place that record in detail the 
maintenance history of safety -critical rail vehicle parts and that any tests on 
replacement parts are appropriate to simulate in -service conditions . 
1.7. The Commission is also recommend ing that the National Rail System  Executive  adopt or 
develop a New Zealand Fire Standard that incorporates , but is not limited to : 
 minimising sources  of fire ignition  
 restricting fire propagation  
 the use of fire-resistant materials  
 of appropriate f irefighting equipment  
 ventilation systems  to protect  crew and passengers from harmful smoke and gases  
 the installation of fixed fire protection systems  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -102  the ability to self -rescue or relocate the train  in the event of a f ire in a tunnel or similar 
hazardous location . 
1.8. A key lesson  identified from this inquiry is that operators of public mass transport systems 
must provide their staff with guidelines, procedures and training to enable them to deal 
effectively with a fire, in stead of relying on their best judgement .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The incident occurred at about 1830  on Tuesday 24  November 2015.  The NZ Transport Agency 
(the Agency) notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) soon after 
the incident occurred.  The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to determine the circumstances and cau ses of the 
incident and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. Commission investigators travelled to  Palmerston North the next day  to inspect the fire -
damaged locomotive .  
2.3. Commission investigators interviewed the train driver  who brought  the locomotive into the 
Palmerston North Terminal , a KiwiRail employee who witnessed t he fire, a locomotive servicing 
assistant and a New Zealand Fire Service investigator.   The Commission obtained the following 
records and documents for analysis:  
 closed -circuit  television (C CTV) recordings from on-site security camera s 
 a phone video recording provided by a witness  
 records of other failures and fires on locomotive power units within the KiwiRail and 
Auckland Transport fleet from the previous  10 years  
 the locomotive 's maintenance records  
 fire policies, procedures and  guidelines from KiwiRail, Transdev2 and Dunedin Rail3 
 the status of f ire detection and fire suppression systems in the main line locomotive  fleet 
 consultation with the manufacturer of the EF cl ass locomotives, Brush Electric UK   
 consultation with the United Kingdom's  Rail Accident Investigation B ranch (RAIB) .  
2.4. On Thursday 10 December 201 5 Commission  investigators  again inspect ed the locomotive .  
With the assistance of KiwiRail engineer s and a Fire Service investigator , critical components 
were removed from the locomotive and transported to the Commission's secure wreckage 
facility in Wellington . 
2.5. On Monday 14 December 201 5 Commission investigators , assisted by a KiwiRail  engineer , 
dismantled the  removed high-voltage cable plug to determine the factors that contributed to its 
failure . 
2.6. On 28 Septemb er 2016 the Commissioners considered a draft report and approved it to be 
sent to interested persons for consultation.  
2.7. Submissions were received from four interested parties.  The Commission has considered all 
submissions and any changes as a result of those submissions have been included in this final 
report.

 Final report RO -2015 -102 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  - timeline of the event  
3.1.1.  On Tuesday  24 November 201 5 at about 1800 , a southbound freight train consisting of a  
single electric locomotive and 12 wagons stopped near the tower in the KiwiRail Palmerston 
North Terminal  (see Figure 2) .   
 
Figure 2  
Palmerston North Terminal  aerial view  
3.1.2.  The train driver was relieved by a local depot driver before six wagons were detached.  The 
train was then moved beyond the 'crossover ' (see Figure 2) where the locomotive was 
detached from the remaining wagons.  The depot driver , assisted by a pilot4, drove the 
locomotive  over the 'flyover ' before it was parked  on the electric departure road (see Figure 2)  
in preparation for a northbound service.  
3.1.3.  The pilot alighted from the 'north end'  locomotive cab and walked towards the main depot 
building.   The depot  driver secured the locomotive  by turning the  lights off  and applying the 
brakes.  
3.1.4.  At 1837 CCTV footage confirmed that a puff of smoke emanated from the locomotive 
transformer5 compartment.  
3.1.5.  At 1838 t he depot drive r alighted from  the 'south end ' locomotive  cab and walked along the 
eastern side of the locomotive towards the main depot building  (see Figure 2) .  As he did so 
flames  shot out of the  side grill e of the transformer compartment (see Figure 3).   
3.1.6.  At 1843  a KiwiRail maintenance engineer observed  the fire and entered the south end cab to 
drop the pantograph6 and disconnect the locomotive from the overhead  power  line. 
3.1.7.  At 1848 a n emergency call was made to the Fire Service request ing its attendance at the fire.  
The Palmerston North Fire Ser vice arrived at the s cene  at 1852.  
3.1.8.  To help the Fire Service determine the most effective way to  extinguish the fire , KiwiRail used 
the internal layout of an electric  locomotive parked nearby  for familiarisation . 
                                                        
4 A pilot is a qualified person who ensures the safety of a train movement by guiding the driver.  
5 The electric locomotive transformer takes the high 25 -kilovolt input voltage and reduces it to a lower 
voltage for the locomotive traction motors to use.  
6 A pantograph is a device fitted to the roof of an electric locomotive that contacts the overhead line 
equipment to convey power to the locomotive traction system.

Figure 3 
Layout of an electric  locomotive  (see Appendix 1 for more detail)  
3.1.9.  At about 1905  KiwiRail overhead traction maintenance staff confirmed to the Fire Service that 
the overhead power line was isolated and earthed.  
3.1.10.  At 1906  the Fire Se rvice  attempt ed to extinguish the fire by  applying water to the outside of 
the locomotive,  aiming the water through the vents on the eastern side of the transformer 
compartment .  The water had no effect on extinguishing the fire.   
3.1.11.  At 1923 the Fire Service applied foam to both external sides of the locomotive transformer 
compartment in an attempt to smother the fire.  The foam had a minimal  effect on 
extinguishing the fire.  
3.1.12.  In response, f irefighters equipped with breathing apparatus entered the internal walkway of 
the loc omotive  (see Figure 3)  and appl ied foam directly to the source of the fire inside the 
transformer compartment . 
3.1.13.  The fire was declared extinguished at 2023 . 
3.1.14.  Both t he interior and the exterior of the transformer compartment  were  damaged  by the fire 
(see Figure 4) .  The fire was contained within the transformer compartment and the 
locomotive  is considered repairable by KiwiRail.

Fire damage to the exterior and interior of the transformer compartment  
 
3.2. The power supply to  the locomotive  
3.2.1.  Power is transferred from the overhead power line  to the locomotive through the pantograph 
and down into the transformer compartment by a high-voltage cable  assembly .  The cable 
terminates in the transformer housing using  a plug and socket arrangement .  The socket is an 
oil-filled reservoir.     
3.2.2.  The high-voltage cable has a conductive  core that is surrounded by insulation, an  earth mesh 
screen , and an outer rubber  sheath  (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 
Cross -section of h igh-voltage cable 
 
3.2.3.  The high-voltage cable assembly is manufactured and delivered as a complete unit , ready to 
install.  The cable plug is bolted to the transformer socket and the space between them is 
filled with insulating transformer oil  (see Figure 6).

Picture 3 - the socket in the transformer housing with the oil drained  
Picture 4 - the socket inside the transformer housing , viewed from the side access hatch  
3.3. The importance of high-voltage cable insulation  
3.3.1.  The quality  of the insulation between the 25-kilovolt7 cond uctors and earthed metal parts is 
essential for providing continuous power to the transformer and for electrical  safety.  Under 
normal operating conditions t he insulation is under con stant electrical stress .  If the insulation 
is weaken ed at any point this could lead to failure and in turn an electrical short to earth .  
3.3.2.  A short to earth will result in a high temperature being generated.  An increase in temperature 
increase s the pressure within the oil-filled socket , which in turn has the potential to cr eate an 
explosion .  
 
 
                                                        
7 A kilovolt is a  unit of electromotive force equal to 1 ,000 volts.

 Final report RO -2015 -102 3.4. Seat of the fire  
3.4.1.  In conjunction with the Palmerston North Fire Service and KiwiRail's EF class high voltage 
expert, a visual examination of the scene was carried out to identify the source of the fire.  
After  observing the burn pattern, the spread of the fire and the heat damage to equipment in 
the transformer compartment, the source of the fire was traced to where the high -voltage 
cable entered the transformer housing ( see Figure 7).  
3.4.2.  The Commission considered a number of factor s that possibly contributed to the degradation 
of insulation and  the failure of a high-voltage cable assembly , includ ing: 
 damage sustained during previous use  
 vibration or heat  in service  
 manufacturing defect  
 damage sustained in storage or poor storage conditions  
 installation damage . 
3.4.3.  The Commission note s that the replacement cables now su pplied  by the same  manufacturer 
replace  the oil -filled socket with  modern solid insulating materials.  
  
 
Figure 7 
Seat of the fire - high-voltage cable terminating in the transformer housing  
3.5. The history of New Zealand  electric locomotive high-voltage cable failures  
3.5.1.  KiwiRail's records show ed that since the commissioning of the electric locomotive fleet 
approximately 3 0 years ago there have been  only three previous cable failures, none of which 
led to  a fire.  
3.5.2.  The last recorded cable failure happened in December 2014 on this same locomotive , and the 
cause was not determined .  The cable was replaced in January 2015  from KiwiRail's own 
stock.  
3.5.3.  The available records did not show  whether the replacement cable was new or second -hand .  
It had passed KiwiRail' s standard 5,000 -volt insulation integrity  test before it was fitted.    
3.6. Fire detection, suppression  and fighting equipment  
3.6.1.  There are currently no fire detection or suppression systems fitted to the EF class of freight 
locomotives , nor was there a require ment when they were manufactured . 

Final report RO -2015 -102 
<< Page 9 >>
 3.6.2.  The EF loc o is divided into five compartments to minimise the possible spread of fire (see 
Figure 3) . 
3.6.3.  Electric locomotives are fitted with 4.5 -kilogram dry powder type fire extinguisher s in each of 
the cabs.  
3.7. Instructions to crew in the event of a fire  
3.7.1.  KiwiRail guid elines in the event of a fire are contained in section 3.2 of the Rail Operating 
Code - Vehicles on Fire (see Appendix 2) , which state s in part : 
When a vehicle on a train is on fire, the Locomotive Engineer [driver] must use 
judgement to the best course to adopt in the circumstance, taking into 
consideration the proximity of fire -fighting appliances, the load of the vehicle, 
and the possibility of damage to bridges, adjacent vehicles and property.  
3.7.2.  KiwiRail informed the Commission that it would expect its staff to put personal safety before 
company assets and equipment.

 Final report RO -2015 -102 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The electric locomotive fleet had been operating between Palmerston North and Hamilton on 
the North Island Main Trunk line for about 30 years.  There had been three previous high -
voltage cable failures  recorded , none of which resulted in a fire.   
4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses what led to the fire within the transformer compartment.  
4.1.3.  The investigation identified three  safety issues that , when addressed , will help to prevent a 
reoccurrence and improve the safety  of both staff and any passengers in a similar event : 
 the high-voltage  cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months , but the 
records available did not show if it was new or re-purposed8, or detail the results of any 
test(s) performed on the cable  assembly to ensure  that it was in serviceable condition  
 the operating procedures and training  given to train crews to respond effectively in the 
event of a fire on a train  were inconsistent  across New Zealand's main rail operators  
 the Natioinal Rail System Standards  has no minimum standards for fire detection  or 
suppression systems on the New Zeal and rail network .  
4.2. What caused the fire  
4.2.1.  The damage caused by the fire was contained within the transformer compartment .  
Commission investigators , assisted by Kiw iRail's high voltage expert , remove d and inspect ed 
the high-voltage  plug that had been identified  as the source of the fire  (see Figure 8) .

4.2.2.  An inspection of the high-voltage  cable plug showed that the insulation had failed  within the 
plug (see Figur e 9 for cross -section detai l).  The breakdown of  the insulation allowed a short to 
earth, causing an explosion that distorted the cable plug and started the fire.  This happened

4.2.3.  An inspection of the  high-voltage  cable plug showed evidence of expansion in all directions  
due to an explosion : 
 an explosive gas vent had occurred through the plug 's copper earth screen just above 
the plug assembly .  It had  melted several strands of the earth and armour braid and 
exited  through the rubber outer  sheath  (see Figure 10)  
 the plug's insulating  hard shell  was burnt near the upper flange and the outer surface 
was distorted.  The insulating pitch inside it  had expanded and forced the end cap off 
(see Fig ure 10) 
 the pressure build -up inside the oil-filled socket had breached the gasket seal between 
the cable plug flange and the transformer housing through an arc of approximately 60° 
(see Figure 11).  The damaged gasket section allowed transformer oil to be forced out 
through the broken seal.

4.2.4.  The explosion caused by the high-voltage  cable plug failure simultaneously expanded the high-
voltage  plug and forced oil out of the socket and ignited it .  It also  caused the  electrical 
protection breakers on the locomotive to trip.   
4.2.5.  The oil socket was designed so that any leakage of oil was automatically topped u p by a 
gravity feed from a multipurpose 3,000-litre oil reservoir.  Once the oil had been ignited the 
fire receiv ed a constant supply of oil that fuelled the fire .   

Final report RO -2015 -102 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.2.6.  The maintenance  shut-off valve  was inaccessible  and the oil supply could not be isolated  due 
to its close proximity to the seat of the fire .  This constant supply of fuel to the fire contributed 
to the difficulties faced by firefighters  attempting to  extinguish the fire.  
4.2.7.  Although the oil could not be isolated, the fire was contained within t he transformer 
compartment by the fire bulkheads , as intended in the original design.  
Finding s  
1. A failure of the  high-voltage  cable plug insulation caused an explosion in the 
high-voltage  cable plug and socket, releasing and igniting transformer oil.  
2. The fire was sustained by  a constant supply of fuel from a  3,000-litre oil 
reservoir , as the maintenance shut -off valve  could not be isolated  due to its 
inaccessibility and close proximity to the seat of the fire .  However, the fire 
was contained within the tr ansformer compartment by the fire bulkheads . 
 
4.3. Cable assembly failure  
Safety issue - the high -voltage cable assembly had been in service for less than 12 months , 
but the records available did not show if it was new or repurposed , or detail the results of any 
test(s) performed on the cable assembly to ensure that it was in serviceable condition . 
4.3.1.  KiwiRail obtain s electric locomotive high-voltage  cable  assemblie s from the original  
manufacturer of the locomotive, Brush Electric UK, which in turn source s them  from a  
specialist external supplier.  The cable  that failed  had been manufactured to a British Rail 
standard.  Brush Electric UK was not aware of any similar  cable failures on its locomotives that 
had resulted in a fire.    
4.3.2.  A high-voltage  cable assembly failure had occurred on this locomotive within the previous  12 
months.  The cable assembly had been  replaced  from KiwiRail stock,  but from the records 
available it was not possible to  determine whether the replacement cable assembly was a new 
or 'repurposed ' unit.   
4.3.3.  The high-voltage  cable assembly had, however, been subjected to a standard KiwiRail 5,000 -
volt insulation integrity test, which it passed.  This insulation integrity test was not 
representative of the 25,000 -volt in-service conditions , but it was considered by KiwiRail  to be 
a suitable and practical compromise test once the cable had been installed . 
4.3.4.  The condition of the replacement cable assembly when installed in January 2015 was 
determined by KiwiRail to be fit for purpose, but the  reason for its subsequent premature 
failure is not clear . 
4.3.5.  It is essential that safety -critical components , which may include  high-voltage  cables, are 
properly identified and documented , and that detailed in-service maintenance records are 
kept.   
4.3.6.  A recommendation was made by the Commission in report R02013 -104 for KiwiRail to 
address a similar issue after the derailment of a metro passenger train  in Wellington  on 20 
May 2013.   The Commission recommended th at KiwiRail  ensure that maintenance work 
carried out at its depots  is undertaken in accordance with good railway engineering practice , 
safety -critical components are identified and documented , and all maintenance work is 
recorded  in detail .  
4.3.7.  The Commission has made a recommendati on to the Chief E xecutive of the NZ Transport 
Agency to address this safety issue.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -102 Finding s  
3. KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering 
practice, as the available service records did not show whether the high-
voltage  cable assembly  that had been in service for about 10 months was 
fitted new or repurposed , or record  the results of any tests performed on the 
cable . 
 
 
 
4.4. Fire preparedness  of New Zealand rail operators on the controlled network  
Safety issue - the operating procedures and  training given to train crews to respond 
effectively in the event of a fire on a train were inconsistent across New Zealand's main rail 
operators . 
4.4.1.  The locomotive fire occurred within a major freight terminal  with good road access.  KiwiRail 
staff were able to provide  expert knowledge regarding specific hazards . Other locomotives of 
the same class were close by and available to the Fire Service to confirm  the internal layout.  
This assisted the Fire Service in fighting the fire ; however , had it occurred away from a depot  
the circumstances may have been more difficult . 
4.4.2.  When the Fire Service arrived  at the scene , vital time was lost whilst the firefighters  were 
familiarised with the locomotive.  T hey had no locomotive -specific information with respect to 
the: 
 hazards on board the specific locomotive class  
 internal layout of the vehicle and the locations of any isolation valves  
 methods  for fighting the fire  specific to this locomotive class . 
Had there been locomotive -class -specific details readily available to the Fire Service , the fire  
might have been extinguished more quickly . 
4.4.3.  When the high-voltage  cable plug failure occurred , the on -board circuit breakers tripped as 
designed and the overhead power supply to the locomotive was isolated.  However, unaware 
of this and without any formal fire training, a KiwiRail maintenance engineer used his best 
judgement and boarded the locomotive to a ctivate the 'emergency pantograph down' button 
in the driver 's cab before the Fire Service arrived.  Despite his best intentions, i n doing so he  
potentially  exposed himself to unnecessary danger and potential ly harmful fumes inside the 
locomotive .  This may have been avoided if clear procedures or guidelines for action in the 
event of a fire had been available . 
4.4.4.  Neither the driver nor the pilot of locomotive EF30157 had received any training in the use of 
the fire extinguishers fitted to their locomotive or the actions to take in the event of a fire.  
4.4.5.  The Commission found that there was a range of documented fire policies, p rocedures and 
guidelines provided by  New Zealand's main rail passenger operators.  The procedures ranged 
from being very  detailed to just instructing staff to use their best judgement.  T here was no 
consistent approach to training drivers and crew on the actions to take in the event  of a fire.  A 
recommendation to address this issue has been made to the Chief Executive of the NZ 
Transport Age ncy.  
4.4.6.  KiwiRail's current safety case lodged with the NZ Transport Agency  does not mention fire risk 
or any related topics.    
Final report RO -2015 -102 
<< Page 15 >>
 Finding s  
4. There are inconsistent  levels of fire management documentation and 
training  in place across New Zealand's major rail passenger  operators .   
5. KiwiRail relied on the best judgement  of locomotive staff for dealing with the 
locomotive fire rather than providing documentation and training . 
6. The firefighting effort was delayed due to the need to obtain information on 
the specifi c locomotive and associated hazards .  
7. The Fire Service obtained information that was critical for the firefighting 
effort  that may not have been available had the fire  occurred away from a 
depot .  
 
4.5. Comp aring the New Zealand  locomotive fleet fire standard to best practice  
Safety issue - the New Zealand Rail Regulatory System has no minimum standards for fire 
detection or suppression systems on freight locomotives and passenger trains  on the New 
Zealand rail network .  
4.5.1.  The Commission sought to ascertain international  best practice in terms of fire detection and 
suppression systems  within the rail industry.  The European standard  EN 45545 - Fire 
Protection on Railway Vehicles  and t he Australian standard  AS 7529 - Railway Rolling Stock - 
Fire Safety , which makes reference to EN  45545 , both define the minimum standard for 
locomotive fire protection to be:  
 freight (diesel electric or electric ) - fire detection  systems  
 passenger (diesel electric) - fire detection and fire suppression  systems  
 passenger (electric ) - fire detection systems and the use of fire-retardant materials . 
4.5.2.  Neither of the se international standards has been formally adopted in New Zealand  as there is 
no clear mechanism to do this , and as a result there is no requirement for the fitting of fire 
detection and suppression systems in New Zealand  locomotives .  Where operators ' policies do 
exist and such systems have been fitted , there is inconsisten t adoption  between operators  on 
the controlled network  (see Appendix 3) . 
4.5.3.  In the case of this locomotive , had fire detection been fitted and activated , a quicker response 
to the fire may have resulted .   
4.5.4.  The Commission sought details of the status of the locomotive fire detection and suppression 
systems of the larger rail passenger operators within  New Zealand.  It compared  those of  four 
New Zealand rail owners /operators : KiwiRail, Auckland Transport, Greater Wellington Regional 
Council  and Dunedin Rail with the international standards  EN 45545 and AS  7529 . 
4.5.5.  The comparison  exclude d (see Appendix 3 fo r comparison detail s): 
 locomotive s that had been  mothballed or had life expectanc ies of less than two years  
 locomotives used for shunting operations only, due to their being low risk  and non-
mainline operations . 
4.5.6.  Overall , only 48 out of a total 286 locomotives  (see Appendix 3) , or 16% , did not meet the 
minimum requirements of the  international standards .  A breakdown of  this by 
owner /operator  and function  shows  (see Figure 12 ): 
 KiwiRail - freight - 31 out of 111 locomotives , or 28%  
 KiwiRail - passenger - three  out of 12 locomotives , or 25%  
 Auckland Transport - passenger - 10 out of 67 locomotives , or 15 % 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final report RO -2015 -102  Greater Wellington Regional Council - 100% compliant  
 Dunedin Rail - passenger - four out of 13 locomotives , or 30% . 
The owner s/operators  of the se locomotives have plans in place to  address  some of the 
shortfalls.   An economic solution for the remaining locomotives  is under consideration . 
 
Figure 12 
Percentage  of operators ' fleet s compliant with international standards  EN45545 and AS7529  
 
4.5.7.  Presently  only 16% of the major N ew Zealand  rail operators' fleets do not meet  the 
requirements of the international standards  for fitting fire detection and suppression systems . 
Where such systems are fitted , there is currently no consistency across the different 
operators .  Adopting or developing a  New Zealand  national standard would provide 
consistency.  
Findings  
8. There is currently no national fire detection and suppression system 
standard adopted across the New Zealand rail sector .   
9. Sixteen percent of the locomotives operating on the New Zealand rail 
network fall short of the international standards for fire detection  and 
suppression on locomotives and electric multiple units.

 5. Findings  
5.1. A failure of the high-voltage  cable  plug insulation caused an explosion in the high-voltage  
cable plug and socket, releasing and igniting transformer oil.  
5.2. The fire was sustained by  a constant supply of fuel from a 3 ,000-litre oil reservoir , as the 
maintenance shut -off valve could not be isolated due to its inaccessibility and close proximity 
to the seat of the fire .  KiwiRail's maintenance record keeping did not meet good engineering 
practice, as the available service records did not show whether the high -voltage cable

 Final report RO -2015 -102 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressed  during the  inquiry  
6.2. After the fire on EF30157, KiwiRail issued a Significant Information  Notice (ML  - 047 - see 
Figure 13) requi ring the immedi ate inspection of  the EF fleet for signs of:  
 high-voltage  cable damage  
 oil leaks  
 flammable debris, rags, etc.  
 
Figure 13 
Significant Information Notice ML  - 047 (see Appendix 4)  

Final report RO -2015 -102 
<< Page 19 >>
 6.3. Additionally, KiwiRail performed  insulation integrity test s on all  of the high-voltage  cables in 
the EF fleet and found one high-voltage  cable assembly with a lower -than -expected reading.  
This cable was replaced  as a precaution.  
6.4. Periodic  testing of the EF class fleet has been implemente d in the Kiwi Rail planned 
maintenance system.   All results are reported to engineering staff for appropriate action to be 
planned as required.  
6.5. KiwiRail has also introduced a Polarisation Index test9 as a final quality check  after the high-
voltage cable assembly has been fitted.  This post -installation test confirms  that the difficult 
installation has not affected  the quality of the cable ins ulation . 
6.6. KiwiRail confirmed to the Commission that all the old -design , 'oil-filled socket' type cables 
have been used up, and that the newer -design cables available from the original manufacturer 
use modern insulation to replace the oil bath.  
6.7. In December 2016 KiwiRail announced that the EF class locomotives will be removed from 
service and replaced with diesel -electric lo comotives by the end of 2018.

 Final report RO -2015 -102 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case  recommendations have been issued  to the National Rail Safety System 
Executive and the N Z Transport Agency , with notice of these recommendations given to  
KiwiRail . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without del ay to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. The Commission found inconsistencies between New Zealand's main rail passenger operators 
in respect of their documented fire policies and procedures.  In this case t he operator had not 
mentioned the risk of fire in its safety case and therefore it had not been considered a 
principle risk to its operation.  As a consequence there were no locomotive -specific fire -fighting 
instructions and the fire -fighting eff ort was delayed until the Fire S ervice had familiarised 
themselves with the locomotive layout.  Inconsistencies were also found between operators in 
respect to the level of fire management documentation and the level of fire training provided 
for train dri vers and crew.   
7.3.1.  The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency ensure that 
in their safety cases the access provider of, and operators using, the National Rail System 
consider fire in rail vehicles as a risk to the safet y of their operation s, and must  demonst rate 
that they have mitigated that risk as far as reasonably practicable.   (001/17) 
On the 31st March 2017, NZ Transport Agency replied:  
The Transport Agency confirms that it will implement this recommendation.  As it 
may involve significant work for some operators, the Transport Agency will need to 
carry out detailed planning to be able to provide the Commission with a definitive 
timeline.  Likely actions include:  
 The Transport Agency notifying affected operators  
 Safety case variations being requested and approved (if required)  
 Conducting a safety assessment of system changes associated with the 
recommendation, to test that the safety risk is being managed so far as 
reasonably practicable . 
7.4. The Commission recommends that t he Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency, when 
conducting safety assessments of each rail licence holder, ensure that they have identified 
and assessed the risk of fire in a rail vehicle. The Chief Executive should ensure that they 
have, as far as rea sonably practicable, minimised the risk and have measures in place to deal 
with the outbreak of, and reactions to , fire events.  (002/17) 
7.5. Although the high -voltage plug assembly had been tested, the test was not representative of 
in-service conditions.  The cable had been in service for less than 12 months when it failed , 
and maintenance records were unable to show whether the cable was new or repurposed  or 
the results of any tests carried out before and after fitting.      
7.5.1.  The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Trans port Agency, when 
conducting safety  assessments of each rail licence holder operating on the National Rail 
System , ensure that systems are in place that record in detail the maintenance history of 
safety -critical rail veh icle parts and that any tests on replacement parts are appropriate to 
simulate in -service conditions.   (003/17) 
Final report RO -2015 -102 
<< Page 21 >>
 On the 31st March 2017, the NZ Transport Agency replied in relation to recommendations 
002/17 and 003/17:  
The Transport Agency confirms it will implement these recommendations.  This will 
occur through our risk based assessment programme.  The programme has a 12 -18 
month cycle to assess all current rail operators, although the Transport Agency will 
prioritise those that present a greater risk.  
The Transport Agency believes that the enduring requirement of fire risk 
identification and mitigation and assurance is important.  We do however note that 
the priority of rail risks may change over time and it considers that it is essential that 
the scope an d focus of assessments adapts to the current risks and environment 
identified through the Transport Agency's risk based approach.  For that reason it 
may prove difficult to eventually close these recommendations b ecause of their on -
going nature.  However, when the Transport Agency has carried out the initial work 
in respect of all rail operators, we will engage with the Commission to discuss our 
perspective on how we can continue to gain assurance of the safety outcomes in 
question.  
7.6. International standards exist for fitting fire detection and suppression systems on freight 
locomotives and passenger trains.  However, they have not been formally adopted across  New 
Zealand.  As a result there is currently no minimum national fire standard for trains operating 
on the New Zealand rail network.  Where operators have identified the need to fit such 
systems, an inconsistent approach has been adopted.      
7.6.1.  The Commission recommends that the National Rail Safety System  Executive adopt or develop 
a New Zealand Fire Standard  that incorporates , but is not limited to : 
 minimising sources of fire ignition  
 restricting fire propagation  
 the use of fire -resistant materials  
 the p rovision of appropriate firefighting equipment  
 ventilation systems to protect crew and passengers from harm ful smoke and gases  
 the installation of fixed fire protection systems  
 the ability to self -rescue or relocate the train in the event of a fire in a tunnel or similar 
hazardous location .  (004/17) 
On the 30th March 2016, the NRSS Executive replied:  
The NRSS Executive noted that the request to 'adopt or develop' would not be within 
the scope of the NRSS Executive to undertake, but does recognise that such matters 
are required to be considered for the operating environment.  Therefore the NRSS 
Executive can pro pose, through relevant NRSS documentation, the consideration of 
relevant international standards for the interoperability environment.  
These standards would also incorporate, but not be limited to those specific areas 
as identified by the Commission, due t o the systems approaches that will be 
required to sustain the Commission's recommendations.  The NRSS Executive noted 
in particular, that rail fire safety is a complex issue and one that requires a system's 
approach across all aspects including infrastruct ure, rolling stock and operations to 
achieve and sustain safe outcomes.
