The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it  is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safe ty.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and  
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occ urrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
membe rs of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 Final report AO -2014 -006  1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 0808 on 7 October 2014, a Robinson R44 helicopter  (the helicopter)  crashed into 
steep bush  to the northeast of Mt Arthur,  in the Kahurangi N ational Park.  The helicopter wa s 
being flown from Karamea to N elson for scheduled maintenance, through  an area of forecast 
high winds and turbulence, at the time of the accident.  
1.2. The helicopter broke  up in  flight after one of the main rotor blades struck the cabin and the 
main rotor as sembly separated from the rest of the helicopter.  The pilot, who was the only 
occupant, was killed.  
1.3. The cause of the main rotor strike and subsequent separation was a phenomenon associated 
with helicopters having  two-bladed , semi -rigid teetering main roto r systems , called 'mast -
bumping' :  
 Mast -bumping is where an excessive teetering or 'see -saw' m ovement of the main 
rotor  causes the inner end  (spindle)  of the blades to contact the main rotor driveshaft 
(or mast), while rotating.   
1.4. Mast -bumping can occur when a  helicopter enter s a low -gravity  (low-G) condition ( less than  1G 
to weightless/zero G) , which can be caused by turbulence or induced by  flight control inputs.  
1.5. In-flight break -ups can also be caused by low main rotor revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Howe ver, t he Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) determined  that 
it was very unlikely that low main rotor RPM was a factor in this  accident.  
1.6. The Commission determined that it was very likely that the helicopter entered a low -G conditio n 
after crossing the Tasman Ranges downwind from  Mt Arthur. Turbulence created by a strong 
southwest wind likely included s evere  downdra ughts that prolonged  the low-G condition, which 
likely  initiated the mast -bump ing. 
1.7. The Commission could not rule out a flight control input  as having contribut ed to the in-flight 
break -up. 
1.8. The Commission made the following  additional  findings : 
 had a previous  limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced Robinson R44 pilots 
remained in place , as per that for Robinson R22 pilots , the pilot would have been 
prohibited from flying at the time of the accident , due to the forecast strong winds and 
turbulence  
 all Robinson helicopter models are susceptible to low -G mast -bumping, and any preventive 
measu res should apply to all of them  
 due to their unique main rotor design, d uring a prolonge d or severe  low-G condition 
Robinson helicopters can roll rapidly  to the right , and likely break  up bef ore a pilot can 
recover  
 a pilot's instinctive reaction to a n unexpected  right roll, or the unintentional movement of a 
pilot's limbs or upper body  during severe turbule nce or low -G, could lead to mast -bumping  
 although  not an intuitive  reaction  to a sudden right roll, the aft cyclic technique is the only 
approved recovery tech nique, and should be used as soon as low -G is felt to 'reload' the 
main rotor disc and help reduce any right roll.  
1.9. The Commission made the following recommendation  to the  Administrator of the  Federal 
Aviation Administration : 
 extend the limitations and requirements of AD  95-26-04 that currently apply to the R22 in 
regard to operating in strong  winds and turbulence, to  the R44 and R66 models ; and 
 extend th ose limitations and requirements  to all R22, R44 and R66 pilots regardles s of 
their experience level s. 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 1.10.  The Commission made the following recommendation  to the Director of Civil Aviation : 
 until the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] actions the above recommendation, he 
extend the limitations and requirements of AD  95-26-04 to R44 and R66 helicopters in 
New Zealand, and make them  applicable to all pilots of Robinson helicopters in New 
Zealand regardless of their experience . 
1.11.  The key lessons  identified from the inquiry into this occurrence are : 
 pilots of two -bladed , semi -rigid rotor helicopters must be acutely aware of the risk s and 
effects of encountering moderate or greater turbulence in strong winds , especially  in the 
lee of high terrain    
 if moderate  or greater  turbulence is encountered while flying a two -blade d, semi -rigid rotor 
helicopter, the pilot should consider landing and waitin g for the conditions to improve  
 pilots of two -blade d, semi -rigid rotor helicopters should be aware of the  helicopters ' 
increased susceptibility to low -G conditions when lightly loade d, and the adverse effects 
that high power and a high  tail rotor have on the rate of roll  
 pilots of Robinson helicopters should use the manufacturer's approved low -G recovery 
technique as soon as low -G conditions are felt .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On Tuesday 7 October 2014 the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) that the helicopter  was 
missing  and that a search was underway.  
2.2. After an extensive ground and air search lasting four days, the accident site was located on 10 
October 2014.  The Commission subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990.  
2.3. On 11 October 2014 two Commission investigators began an i nspection of the accident site. 
The wreckage was recovered on 13 October 2014 and was taken to the Commission's storage 
facility near Wellington.  
2.4. The investigator in charge interviewed the owner of the helicopter and two other witne sses , 
who provided info rmation about  the weather in the area around the time of the accident. 
Records of the helicopter's maintenance history and the pilot's  logbook were  collected to  
review.  
2.5. The helicopter was fitted with a TracPlusTM flight tracking system , which recorded  auto matic  
position reports from the helicopter. TracPlus Global L imited provided the investigation with 
the flight tracking data for the accident helicopter and the second helicopter flown by the 
owner.  
2.6. The wreckage of the helicopter was reviewed in detail at the Commission's Wellington facility 
by the investigation team and a Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson)  safety investigator.   
A section of the main rotor blade was also inspected by a metallurgist.  
2.7. A portable GPS  (global positioning system)  unit w as re covered from the accident site  and sent 
to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau in Canberra for recovery of the recorded data . The 
data recover ed provided flight track information leading up to the accident . 
2.8. The instructor who had carried out the pilot's  Robinson safety awareness training and type 
ratings2, and the flight examiner who had issued the pilot's helicopter licence, were both 
interviewed by the investigator in charge.  
2.9. The CAA file s on the pilot and the helicopter were reviewed.  The pilot's personal and aviation 
medical history was reviewed.  
2.10.  On 6 October 2016  the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.11.  The draft report was reviewed by an independent expert with experience in helicopter flight 
testing and certification.  
2.12.  Submissions were received from the manufacturer, the CAA, the owner and the pilot 's next of 
kin.  Any changes resulting from those submissions have been included in this final report . 
2.13.  On 22 February  2017 the Commission approved t he publication of the final report.

 Final report AO -2014 -006 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 7 October 2014 a Robinson R44 II helicopter ZK-HBQ  (the helicopter) was due at Nelson 
aerodrome for scheduled maintenance by 0815.  The pilot ferrying3 the helicopter from its 
normal operating base at Karamea to Nelson had earlier checked the weather conditions 
along the proposed route and decided to delay his departure due to forecast high winds.  
3.1.2.  The pilot had met with the owner of the helicopter at Kar amea aerodrome  at about 0700 to 
discuss the forecast weather conditions.  The pilot was concerned th at winds of over 30 
knots4 from the southwest  were forecast for  the area he was to fly through.  The owner , who  
was about to depart in another R44 to work i n the  Kahurangi National Park, told the pilot he 
would assess the wind strength and contact him on the helicopter 's radio.  
3.1.3.  The owner departed Karamea at 0709 and flew to Grange Ridge to pick up some Department 
of Conservation workers, before flying to Mt O wen.  On the way to Mt Owen , at approximately 
0730, the owner contacted the pilot by radio and reported  that the wind strength was actually 
more like 15 -20 knots and gu sting at Grange Ridge.  He suggested that the pilot fly up the 
Karamea R iver and then th e Crow R iver, so that he would cross the Tasman Ranges to the 
south of Mt Arthur , which was clear of any cloud.   After receiving this information the pilot 
decided to depart Karamea for Nelson.  
3.1.4.  Based on GPS5 and flight tracking data6 (see Appendix 1) , the pilot departed Karamea 
aerodrome  at about 0 740 and flew up the Karamea R iver at about 500 feet above ground 
level (AGL).  He then f ollowed the Leslie R iver up to the T ablelands area to the west of Mt 
Arthur , before flying  up the Flora S tream towards the Flora Saddle at about 500 feet AGL .  
That was a different route from that recommended  to him by the owner .  The  pilot crossed 
over the Tasman R anges to the northeast of Mt Arthur  and approximately 500 metres to the 
southwest of the Flora  Saddle at a he ight of about 350  feet AGL.  
3.1.5.  The final position report received from the TracPlusTM flight tracking system was:  
 time:   0806 New Zealand Daylight Time 
 position:   041˚10'29" south, 172˚42'24" east  
 altitude:   3,990 feet (1 ,216 metres)  
 groundspeed:  83 knots  
 track:   108 degrees True (ºT).  
3.1.6.  Based on the flight tracking data and information recovered from the on -board GPS unit, the 
time of t he accide nt was about 0808.   
3.1.7.  At about 0840  the owner  was back  at Karamea  preparing to fly the second R44 helicopter to 
Nelson for maintenance,  with his wife and daughter on  board.  He viewed the  position reports  
for the first helicopter  on the flight tracking system  before leaving , and saw  that the pilot had  
flown  up the Leslie River and crossed to the north of Mt Arthur, so he decided to  follow him . 
3.1.8.  The owner flew along the same route the pilot had flown, and crossed the Tasman Ranges just 
to the north  of the Flora Saddle . As he flew up the Flora S tream , about an hou r after the pilot 
had done, he  encountered moderate turbu lence7 that "increased once [he] passed the Flora

kilometre to the northeast of the point where the accident occurred.  
3.1.9.  The owner contacted Nelson Airport Control Tower8 after crossing the Tasman Ranges  to ask 
whether the first helicopter had arrived at Nelson.  The tower controller told him they had not 
heard from the pilot of the first helico pter, so the owner flew  back to the last known point 
recorded b y the flight tra cking system to  conduct a search.  After searching the area around 
the Flora Saddle  and listening for an  emergency locator transmitter  (ELT)9 transmission 
without success, the owner flew to Nelson and raised the alarm at the search and rescue 
hangar  at the  airport.  
3.1.10.  An extensive air search using the local rescue helicopter  was subsequently carried out, 
focusing on the area around the last position recorded by the flight tracking system. Strong 
winds and turbulence were encountered by the pilots of the  first search and rescue 
helicop ters to reach the area .  Several  helicopters were used over the course of the next three  
days, and ground teams search ed the dense bush in the area around the Flora Saddle .  On 
the fourth day of searching the wreckage was found in  steep , dense bush approximately 1.5 
kilometres south of the Flora Saddle .  The deceased pilot was found next to the wreckage, 
which had been  destroyed by a post -impact  fire. 
3.2. Personnel information   
3.2.1.  The pilot had obtained a private pilot licence  (PPL)  (aero plane) in February 2013, and then 
commenced helicopter flight training in September 2013 on the Robinson R22. Prior to his 
first solo flight in the R22 he had completed the required safety  awareness training . He had 
obtained a PPL  (helicopter) in November 2013.  
3.2.2.  The pilot had planned to complete a  commercial pilot licence  (CPL)  (aeroplane) and a CPL 
(helicopter) after  he had built up his hours to the required levels10 and after passing the  
theoretical exams  in his spare time .  He had built up his hours mainly flying aeroplanes 
between Karamea and Nelson and Karamea and Blenheim during the 18 months prior to the 
accident, and had only recently begun to build up his hours on helicopters.  He had completed 
some of his exams and flight training for  his CPL (aeroplane), and obtained a type rating for 
the R44 helicopter in September 2014.  
3.2.3.  The pilot had 287 hours ' total flying time, consisting of 222 hours on aeroplanes and 65 hours 
on helicopters.  At the time of the accident he had flown the R44 type  for approximately 11 
hours. The owner of the helicopter had offered the pilot work once he finished his CPL 
(helicopter) and the pilot had been carrying out ferry flights for the owner in the R44 to help 
build up his hours.   As part of his PPL (helicopter ) flight test in November 2013  his knowledge 
of the safety awareness training for the R22 had been  assessed, and low-gravity ( low-G11) 
recovery techniques had been  discussed.    
3.2.4.  In the 90 days prior to the accident flight the pilot had flown 20 hours on aer oplanes and 9.5 
hours on helicopters (all on the R44 ).  He had not flown in the seven  days prior to the 
accident.  
3.2.5.  The pilot was reported to have been  in good health on the morning of the accident.  
3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  The Robinson Helicopter Company  R44 is  a four -seat light helicopter  developed from the R22 
two-seat model,  and was introduced to service in 1993.  The R44  II was first produced in 
2002, and features a fuel -injected engine and a maximum certificated take -off weight of 
                                                        
8 Nelson Airport Control Tower is an air traffic control unit at Nelson aerodrome that controls the airspace in the Nelson 
aerodrome area.  
9 An emergency locating transmitter (ELT) emits a distress signal during an accident that can be received by satellites and 
other aircraft.  
10 A CPL (aeroplane)  licence  required 200 hours of flight time ; a CPL (helicopter)  licence  required 150 hours of flight time.  
11 Low-g is an a cceleration less than that due to the force of gravity.

 Final report AO -2014 -006 1,134 kilograms .  A turbin e-powered , five-seat R66 complete s the Robinson  range  of light 
helicopters , which are used worldwide for private and commercial flights.  
3.3.2.  The helicopter was manufacture d in 2004 and had been operated by the owner since  2006.  
The airframe had accrued approximately 3 ,450 hours ' total time and the engine had accrued 
approximately 2 ,14612 hours since overhaul.  At the time of the accident the helicopter had no 
outstanding defects and had a valid non -terminating airworthiness certificate.   
3.3.3.  The helicopter left Karamea with  85 litres of fuel on  board, and the amount of fuel used during 
the 30 -minute flight to the location of the accident was approximately 30 litres.  The estimated 
weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident was 857 kilograms  and the centre of 
gravity13 was 100.3 inches aft of datum. This was below the 1 ,034 kilograms  maximum all -up 
weight limit and within the allowable centre of gravity  range of 92 to 102.5 inches aft of 
datum.

Robinson helicopter main rotor system   
3.3.4.  All three Robinson types have  two-blade d, semi -rigid teetering14 main rotors. The blades have 
independent coning15 hinges, a feature unique to Robinson (see Figure 1). Pilots flying 
helicopters with two -blade, teetering main rotor systems must avoid low -G16 conditions 
                                                        
12 The normal time before overhaul of the engine was 2 ,000 hours ; however , if the helicopter was flown on average more 
than 40 hours per month this could be extended to 2 ,200 hours . 
13 The centre of gra vity is the single point in a helicopter through which the weight (or force of gravity) acts.  
14 Teetering is the see -saw movement of a two -bladed, centrally mounted rotor hub.  
15 Coning is the vertical movement of a blade about a hinge perpendicular to the blade span.   
16 Low-G conditions occur when an object is subjected to a net vertical force less than the force of gravity. When the 
vertical force is zero, the object is described as being 'weightless' .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  because t hese can cause th e helicopter to roll without the  pilot making a control input (an 
uncomman ded roll) , which can  lead to mast -bump ing17.   
3.3.5.  The R44  flight manual included a limitation prohibiting  low-G cyclic pushover manoeuvres , and 
contained the following information  (Robinson , 21 Feb ruary  2014 , pp. 2-5): 
Low-G cyclic pushovers prohibited.  
CAUTION  
A pushover (forward cyclic maneuver) performed from level flight or following a pull -up causes 
a low -G (near weightless) condition which can result in catastroph ic loss of lateral control .  To 
eliminate a low -G condition, immediately apply gentle aft cyclic.  Should a right roll commence 
during a low -G condition, apply gentle aft cyclic to reload the rotor before  applying lateral 
cyclic to stop roll.  
3.3.6.  The R44 main rotor controls, like those of the R22 and R66, are sensitive , and  the following 
limitation  appears  in the flight manual (R obinson , 21 Feb ruary  2014 , p. 2.5):  
CAUTION  
Abrupt control inputs may produce high fatigue stresses and cause catastrophic failure of a 
critical component.  
3.3.7.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook comprised the mandatory  Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) approved flight manual, as well as a section of 'Safety Tips and Notices ' issued by the 
Robinson  Helicopter Company . These safety tips and no tices are applicable to all Robinson 
types. Several of the safety notices  (see Appendix 6 ) provided guidance to pilots on how to 
avoid a potentially catastrophic "loss of control " of the main rotor. 'Loss of control' refers to 
the main rotor blades flying a path that might be different from tha t intended by the pilot, most 
commonly due to  a low -G condition or because the rotor revolutions per minute (RPM)  have 
decreased  below the normal operating  range.  
3.4. Meteorological information  
3.4.1.  On 7 October 2014 the weather forecast (see Appendix 2) for the Tasman region  was for 
areas of broken cloud to the west of the Tasman Ranges, with a base of 3 ,000 feet18 and 
cloud tops at 8 ,000 feet .  A strong west -to-southwest flow was forecast to weaken late 
morning.  The wind  direction and speed at about the same altitude and at the time the pilot 
crossed the ranges were  forecast to be  from 260 ºT and 30-40 knots  respectively . 
3.4.2.  At the time of departure t he aerodrome forecast for Westport, the nearest19 aerodrome to 
Karamea, was for scattered cloud and 20 kilometres ' visibility, with wind from 220 ºT and at 
25 knots at an altitude  of 2,000 feet . At the estimated time of arrival  at Nelson , the weather  
was forecast to be  scattered cloud and 30 kilometre s' visibility, with wind from 220 ºT and at 
35 knots at an altitude  of 2,000 feet.    
3.4.3.  There was a SIGMET20 issued for isolated severe turbulence in the upper South Island, north 
of a line between Westport and Christchurch.  There was a risk to pilots of encounter ing 
severe turbulence when flying below 10 ,000 feet , at the time of the flight.  
3.4.4.  The owner said that the cloud s in the Tasman Ranges  were mainly to the northwest of Mt 
Arthur.  He told the pilot that the area to the south of Mt Art hur was clear of cloud, an d he

mast) . 
18 All altitudes, cloud bases and tops, and wind heights are expressed in thousands of feet above mean sea level (AMSL) 
unless specified.  Cloud cover is expressed in eights or 'octas'; 'broken' cloud is five to seven octas of cover, scattered is 
three to four octas.

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 assessed the wind strength as being 15 -20 knots  and gusting  at 4,000 feet, in the lower 
Karamea River  area  near Grange Ridge . 
3.4.5.  A hiker staying at Balloon Hut in the T ablelands area  (about 10 kilometres  to the west of Mt 
Arthur ), on the night of 6 October 2014 , recalled unsettled weather the following morning.  
She described scattered clouds early in the morning, followed by squally conditions and hail at 
about 0745 .  She recall ed hearing a helicopter at around 0800, and that it w as "very windy " 
at that time.  
3.4.6.  A landowner who lived approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the Flora Saddle  recalled 
seeing "fog rolli ng in over the Flora Saddle " from the west, and a strong southwest wind early 
in the morning on the day of the acciden t. 
3.4.7.  The pilot of the first search and rescue helicopter  to reach the accident site stated that the 
wind around the Flora Saddle had been about 20 knots when he arrived in the area.  He  had 
arrived at the site  more than two and a half hours after the accident happened .  That was  
about the time that the wind strength was forecast to reduce to 20 knots (see TN ARFOR in 
Appendix 2).  
3.5. Flight recorders  
3.5.1.  There was no requirement for the helicopter to be fitted with a flight data recorder, and one 
was not fitte d.  However, the owner had installed a TracPlusTM flight tracking system that 
recorded flights (see Appendix 1 ) using GPS equipment and satellites, together wit h computer 
software that enabled  the owner to view the helicopter 's location in flight.  The on -board GPS 
equipment sent a position report every three minutes to satellite s that transmitted the data to 
the computer program , to be stored for future reference or live viewing.  Sometimes the 
transmissions from the on -board equipment would not be receive d by the satellites due to 
high terrain or aircraft structure s blocking the signal s to the s atellite s during turns, so a 
position report could be missed.  
3.5.2.  A portable GPS unit was also fitted f or en -route navigation, which displayed  a live map to th e 
pilot a nd updated  the helicopter 's position continually.  The unit was found intact and the 
flightpath  history  was successfully recovered by the A ustralian Transport Safety Bureau .  The 
unit had recorded the accident flight  (see Figure 2) up to the point  at which  the break -up 
occurred and the power to the unit was interrupted.  The route recorded on the portable GPS 
matched the one from the flight tracking system, but the GPS unit provided a more accurate 
and complete route as well as recording the final movement of the helicopter before it broke 
up. 
3.5.3.  The data from the on -board  GPS showed that the pilot departed Karamea at 0743 and flew up 
the Ka ramea River,  following it at low level to the junction with the Leslie River.  The pilot then 
followed the  Leslie River no rtheast to the T ablelands area before turning to the east to cross 
the Tasman Ranges to the south of the Flora Saddle , and to the northeast of Mt Arthur.  The 
groundspeed of the helicopter was between  75 and 90 knots for the majority of the flight, with 
minor fluctuations above and below this range.  
3.5.4.  The pilot maintained an altitude of about  3,900 feet as he flew  east up the Flora Stream 
towards the Flora S addle, then turned slightly to the right to cross a ridgeline about 500 
metres  to the southwest of the Flora S addle.  He crossed the ridge a t a height of a bout 350 
feet AGL  and five kilometres to the northeast of Mt Arthur.   After crossing the ridge  the 
helicopter started to turn further to the right and descend.   The last recorded position on the 
GPS unit was 41º11"45' south and 172º44"11'  east, with the helicopter in a turn to the right 
and descending through an altitude of about 3 ,700 feet.  
3.6. Wreckage and accident site  information  
3.6.1.  The main wreckage was found in d ense bush on steep terrain approximately one kilometre 
south of the last position recorded on th e GPS unit, at an altitude of about 2 ,200 feet  (see 
Figure 2).  The main wreckage , consisting of the cabin, engine, main rotor transmission and 
tail boom, fell through the tree canopy in a southerly direction.  Despite being fitted with a n 
 

<< Page 9 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  'impact -resistant ' fuel tank, the cabin and fuselage had been burnt out by an intense fuel -fed 
fire as a result of the  significant  impact forces.  
3.6.2.  The first items found in the wreckage trail , which began approximately 500 metres from the 
last GPS position , included a rotor tie down, the aircraft flight manual and the GPS unit itself. 
These items were roughly in a line between the last GPS point and the mai n wreckage, with 
lightweight debris  such as windscreen Perspex and paper documents found to the east of 
these items.

Main rotor as found  
3.6.3.  The main rotor was found approximately 100 metres from the main wreckage and to the west 
of the other items (see Figure 3).  A three -foot outboard section of one blade  was missing. The 
main rotor driveshaft had sheared just below the teeter stops21, which had been crushed by 
the bla de spindles22 (see Figure 4).  One of the pitch change horns had broken  off, and bo th 
pitch change links had failed at the upper rod end threads. There was arc -shape d scoring 
damage to the main rotor h ub outboard surfaces , and the remaining pitch change horn 
displayed  impact damage.  
                                                        
21 Teeter stops are urethane  blocks fitted to a main rotor driveshaft that prevent the main rotor spindles contacting the 
driveshaft in no rmal operation, and allow +/ - 7.4 degrees of teetering from the horizontal . 
22 A spindle  is the inner end of a main rotor blade, which is attached to the rotor hub.

 Final report AO -2014 -006  
Figure 4  
Main rotor driveshaft damage  
3.6.4.  The damage to the cabin and main rotor blades showed that one of the ma in rotor blades had 
entered the cabin and wrapped underneath the helicopter  under rotation .  The outboard 
section of this blade had then  broke n off when its leading edge struck  the rear skid cross tube 
in an upward direction.  
3.7. Medical and pathological information  
3.7.1.  A post -mortem examination determined  that the pilot died  from multiple injuries sustain ed 
during the accident . 
3.7.2.  The result s of toxicology tests carried out indicated there w ere no performance -impairing 
substances present in the pi lot's system .   
3.8. Survival aspects  
3.8.1.  The search for the accident site took over three days because no signal was detected fr om the 
emergency locator transmitter (ELT )23 and because the helicopter had crashed in dense bush  
and rugged terrain . It was later found that the co -axial antenna cable had separated f rom the 
ELT in the crash .  The unit had been activated , but a signal would not ha ve been transmitted 
effectively  because of  the separated antenna . 
3.8.2.  The position reports from the flight tracking unit fitted to the helicopter greatly reduced the 
size of the initial search area. Not all aircraft are fitted with tracking devices, and t heir 
effectiveness depends on the selected int erval between position reports, the surrounding 
terrain , satellite  position s and the installation of the unit s. 
3.8.3.  Although the accident was not survivable, the lack of an ELT signal delayed the discovery of 
the wreckage and the recovery of the pilot .  More than  80 hours of helicopter flying were  
required to find the accident site, along with many hours of g round searching  over three days.  
                                                        
23 An ELT sends a primary signal on 406 megahertz for detection by search and rescue satellites. A lower -power, longer -
duration secondary signal on 121.5 megahertz is t o assist search aircraft to 'home in ' on the site.   

 

<< Page 13 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  A more crashworthy ELT, or an ELT with an integral antenna, would  have likely reduced the 
time required to  find the site. 
3.8.4.  The Commission has previously made recommendations24 regarding the use of flight tracking 
devices and  improvements to the crashworthine ss of ELTs . On 26 February 2014 the 
Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation:  
a.  encourage the use of flight tracking devices, especially for use in aircraft operating in 
remote areas around New Zealand  (005/14)25 
b.  continue to support the international work underway to improve the crash survivability of 
ELTs and to include GPS information in the data transmitted by such devices (006/14)26.   
3.9. Safety awareness training for pilots flying Robinson helicopters   
3.9.1.  The history of mast -bump  accide nts with the R22 , and the ac tions taken to reduce their 
frequency , are pertinent to this investigation because all Robinson models  have the same 
main rotor system design and similar response s to low -G. In 1996 th e United States National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB ) completed a special investigati on into R22 mast -bump  
accidents27.  An overview of that investigation and the actions taken by the FAA in response is 
in Appendix 3.  
3.9.2.  During the NTSB investigation the FAA committed to establishing Flight Standardization 
Boards that would determine the operational and training requirements for  pilots of future 
helicopters.   The requirements were to include any additional knowledge or skills necessary 
for a typical pi lot to handle the normal and emergency procedures applicable to a new type.  
3.9.3.  The first Flight Standardization Boards were established in February 1995 for the R22 and 
R44.   The boards determined that it was necessary for R22 and R44 pilots t o understand th e 
effects of low -G and how to make a safe recovery from a low -G condition. Those topics are 
relevant for any helicopter with a two -bladed, teetering, underslung rotor system, but in 1995 
they were not in the helicopter pilot licence training syll abus of th e FAA (or the  CAA). They have 
since been  added to training syllabuses.  
3.9.4.  To formalise the boards' determinations, the FAA in March 1995 published Special Federal 
Aviation Regulation No. 73 (SFAR 73),  which mandated "Special Training and Experience 
Requirements " for all pilots of R22 and R44 helicopters, including pilots who were already 
qualified to fly either type.  
3.9.5.  On 29 June 2009 the FAA concluded that SFAR 73 should be permanent for both the R22 and 
the R44, even though, by then, the  pilot traini ng syllabuses included the relevant topics. 
However, in New Zealand the requirement for R44 pilots to have the special t raining and 
experience had been  deleted in 2004 as a result of a CAA flight manual amendment28. 
3.9.6.  Between March 2014 and March 2015 , the CA A conducted a review of SFAR 73 in the context 
of the N ew Zealand  aviation system. This was in response to a recommendation made by the 
Commission during an inquiry into an R22 accident (see footnote 24). The review29 
concl usions included the following:  
                                                        
24 Refer to Commission inquiry 11 -003, in -flight break -up, ZK -HMU, Robinson R22, near Mt Aspiring, 27 April 2011.   
25 In September  2014 a consultation document was circulated  by the CAA to seek feedback from the aviation industry 
regarding the required equipment for locating aircraft in an emergency.  
26 In December 2015 a Domestic Policy for the emergency location of aircraft was published by the CAA, which included 
a proposed revision of ELT standards and performance -based rules for ELTs.  
27 At the time, loss -of-main -rotor -control accidents accounted for more than a third of R22 accidents in the United States. 
During the special investigation the scope was widened to include sim ilar R44 accidents.    
28 The training requirement was reinstated in May 2016 ; however , the experience requirements still apply to  the R22  
only. 
29 At the time of the CAA's review, New Zealand did not require SFAR 73 training for R44 pilots.   

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 d)    … as a result of the similarities of [the R22, R44 and R66] combined with New Zealand 
accident data it is important that R44 and R66 pilots have a clear understanding of [the 
topics covered in the Robinson special training] and mitigation strategies  
e)    However … there is currently no mechanism for requiring that those flying the R44 and  
R66 have had that training . 
3.9.7 . In April 2015 the CAA issued a consultation document, 'Robinson Helicopter Fleet', that 
described its proposals for regulatory chang e to:  
 standardise the conduct and improve the oversight of the special Robinson training in 
New Zealand  
 restore the special training requirement for R4 4 pilots (that had been removed in 
200430)  
 make the SFAR 73 special training applicable to R66 pil ots. 
3.9.8.  Following public consultation on the proposed changes, the Director applied to the  Wellington 
District  Court in October 2015 for a Warrant of Authority to Impose Conditions on the 
operation of R22 and R44 helicopters. One of the operating conditions that the court granted 
reinstated SFAR 73 special training for New Zealand R44 pilots, with effect from 6 November 
2015.  
 
 
                                                        
30 The background to the removal of the requirement for R44 pilots was given in Commission report 11 -003, in -flight 
break -up, ZK -HMU, Robinson R22, near Mt Aspiring, 27 April 2011.   
 

<< Page 15 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  4. Analysis  
4.1     Introduction  
4.1.1.  This accident was the first confirmed in -flight break -up of an R44 in New Zealand, although 
there had been 13 in-flight break -up accidents in New Zealand involving the R22 mode l (see 
Appendix 5) .  An in-flight break -up of an R66  occurred in March 201331, and another R44  in-
flight break -up occurred in February 2015 (see footnote 42). 
4.1.2.  The conditions that can lead to in -flight break -ups are well known, and are commonly 
discussed during accident investigations and in safety information provided by manufacturer s.  
The three main causal factors that can each lead to  an in-flight break -up are: 
 main rotor RPM below the normal operating range (low main rotor RPM)  
 abrupt or inappropriate cyclic control32 movements  
 low-G conditions  resulting in  mast -bump ing. 
4.1.3.  In this accident t he damage to the main rotor blades, teeter stops and blade spindles 
indicated that a mast -bump occurred prior to the in -flight break -up.  Mast -bumping is when the 
main rotor teeters (or see -saws) beyond the normal operating limits and repeatedly contacts 
the teeter stops on the main rotor driveshaft (or 'mast'). In a severe case of mast -bump ing the 
teeter stops are crushed, the mast itself is contacted, an d an in -flight break -up occurs.  
4.1.4.  It is difficult to determine the exact sequence of events tha t lead to  severe mast -bumping  and 
in-flight break -ups, as they are  always fatal and happen extremely quickly.  The level of 
destruction and the historic al lack of witness es or any recording devices on light helicopters 
make the task of analysing break -ups difficult . 
4.1.5.  There had been two recent non-fatal mast -bump ing incidents  involving R22s in New Zealand, 
of which one was investigated by the Commission33.  These incidents  have helped the 
understand ing of  what happens during mast -bump ing, and in particular the conditions that 
lead to it developing and the pilot's successful recovery of the situation.  
4.1.6.  The following  section s discuss  what likely happened leading up to the in -flight break -up, the 
three main  causal factors, and the Robinson  main rotor system design and dynamic behaviour 
in low-G conditions.  Low-G in turbulence, pilot training  requirements  and operating limitations 
for Robinson helicopters are also discussed , as are aerodynamic  and design  factors  that could  
contribute to  low-G mast -bump ing, and low-G recovery techniques.  
4.2.       What happened  
4.2.1.  The damage to the cabin , rear skid cross tube  and one of the main rotor blades showed that 
the main rotor  blade  struck the cabin and initiated the in -flight break -up. The pitch change 
links that control led the angle of the main rotor blades failed34, which likely happened after 
the teeter stops had been crushed and prior to the break -up.  When  both pitch  change links 
fail in  flight , the main rotor blades can rotate  uncontrolled  around th eir spindles , which 
changes their pitch angle s (see Figure 5) .  Depending on a number of variables, including 
aerodynamic  loads  and flight control inputs  at the time of failure , the main rotor blades can go 
into either  a positive or  a negative angle of attack  (see Figure 5) , causing them to fly up or 
down .

March 2013 . 
32 The movement of the cyclic flight control causes the rotor blade pitch angles to change, which causes the rotor 'disc' 
to tilt in the same direction in which the pilot has moved the control. The helicopter then moves in that direction . 
33 Refer Commission inquiry AO-2013-005, Robinson R22 ZK -HIE, in -flight loss of control, New Plymouth, 30 March 2013 . 
34 The pitch change links can fail in compression or tension as a result of reverse cycle bending during extreme teetering 
of the main rotor system outside the normal operating limits , due to contact with the pitch change horn.

Main rotor blade angles (source : AAIB)  
4.2.2.  One of the main rotor blades was bent in an upward direction, with creases in the upper 
surface of the blade.  This could have  been caused by exc essive coning of the blade  in a low -
rotor -RPM situation , where  the lift produced and the  centrifu gal forces on the blade would 
have been  overcome by  the weight of the helicopter, and the blade bent up towards the tips.  
It could  also have been caused by an uncon trolled  blade going into a very high angle of 
attack35, with the subsequent high aerodynamic drag loads resulting in bending in an upward s 
and rearwards  direction  opposite to the direction of rotation .  
4.2.3.  The other main rotor blade had bent in a downwards direction and entered the cabin , before 
folding underneath the helicopter and striking the rear skid cross tube , which broke off the 
outboard thr ee-foot section of the blade.  It is likely that this happened as a result of the 
failure of the blade 's pitch change link and the blade 's subsequent rotation into a negative 
angle of attack. If the blade had gone  into a negative angle of attack, instead o f producing lift 
in the normal upward direction, a downward aerodynamic reac tion would have forced  the 
blade into the cabin.  This is a form of main rotor 'divergence '36, where the main rotor disc37 
goes in an undesired or unco mmanded  direction , and is typical  of a low -G-induced mast -bump  
(see Appendix 10) . 
4.2.4.  Once the blade entered the cabin and struck the rear skid cross tube , a sudden overload of 
the main rotor drive system occurred.  The bending and torsional failure  of the thick steel main 
rotor drive shaft  likely happened at this point, and indicates that a significant amount of power 
was being delivered by the engine at the time .  The main rotor then separated from the 
helicopter and the fuselage fell to the ground.    
Finding  
1. A mast -bump occurred, wh ich led to rotor divergence and the in -flight break -up. 
 
In-flight break -up causal factors  
4.3.      Low main rotor RPM  
4.3.1.  If the m ain rotor RPM is allowed to reduc e below the normal operating range , main rotor stall 
and an in -flight break -up can result  (see Appendix 6, safety notice 10) .  A reduction in RPM 
can be caused by overpitching38 the blades to the point where the engine can no longer 
maintain rotor RPM, or by not reducing the angle of attack of the blades quickly  enough after 
an engine failure.   A main rotor divergence  caused by low rotor RPM  is different from  that 
caused by low-G mast -bumping, with the rearward travel ling blade normally moving in a 
                                                        
35 Damage seen on  blades and rotor hub outboard surface s show the blades can rotate 90 degrees  or more , which could 
result in the blad es being perpendicular to the airflow . 
36 A main rotor divergence refers to a main rotor disc tilting or moving in an undesired or uncommanded direction.  
37 The main rotor disc is the area or space taken up by the blades in one revolution . 
38 Overpitching is where the pilot increases the angle of attack of the main rotor blades to the point where the 
aerodynamic drag on the blades cannot be overcome by the engine and the main rotor RPM decreases .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  downward direction . In most low-G mast -bump in -flight break -ups, the forward travelling blade 
moves in a downward direction.   
4.3.2.  The speed of a helicopter in forward flight cr eates a dissymmetry of lift39 across  the rotor disc 
due to the higher speed through the air40 of the forward travelling blade compared with the 
rearward  travelling blade  (see Figure 6).  The unequal lift produced by  the rotor disc is 
normally compensated for by reducing the effective angle of attack of the forward -travelling 
blade by teetering  (flapping)  the rotor blade  up with each revolution, and the opposite 
rearward -travelling b lade down to increase its effective angle of attack (see Appendix 4).  If the 
main rotor RPM reduces below the normal operating range, the speed of the rearward 
travelling blade through the air can fall below that required to maintain the airflow over the 
upper surface of the blade.  T he blade will then  experience an  aerodynamic stall and lose lift.   
 
Figure 6  
Dissymmetry of lift due to forward airspeed  (source: FAA)  
4.3.3.  In this situation t he forward travelling blade with its higher speed through the air has not 
stalled and is still producing lift, so the net effect is that the rearward trave lling blade  'wants' 
to dive  and the forward travelling blade 'wants' to climb .  Due  to gyroscopic precession41 (see 
Appendix 4), the result of thi s type of divergence is tha t the rotor disc tilts rearwards  and the 
rotor blades strike  or sever the tail boom .  
4.3.4.  In both  of these cases of rotor divergence the teeter stops are crushed ; the main difference is 
whether the c abin or the tail boom is struck  by the blades.  In this accident the  tail boom of 
the helicopter was not  struck by the main rotor and the forward travelling blade moved 
downward  and entered the cabin.  
Finding  
2. The in -flight break -up was very unlikely to have been caused by low main rotor  
RPM  (revolutions per minute) . 
 
                                                        
39 Dissymmetry of lift is the unequal production of lift across t he rotor disc as a result of forward airspeed . 
40 Airspeed refers to the speed of an aircraft ; the speed of a rotor through the air is the helicopter's airspeed plus the 
speed or rotation (RPM) for the forward travelling blade, or minus for the rearward tra velling blade . 
41 Gyroscopic precession is when  a force applied to a spinning gyroscope is transmitted 90 degrees in the direction of 
rotation i.e. pushing the front of a clockwise spinning disc down results in it tilting to the right .

 Final report AO -2014 -006 4.4.     Abrupt, inappropriate  or inadvertent  cyclic control movement  
4.4.1.  The flight controls of all Robinson helicopter  models  are very sensitive.  S mall movements of 
the cyclic control are required to avoid  over-controlling and producing high stresses on critical 
control components , which can  cause catastrophic failures  (see 3.3. 6).   
4.4.2.  Many in -flight break -up accident reports have concluded  that due to the absence of 
mechanical failures, the causal factor was likely  an inappropria te cyclic control input from the 
pilot that led to mast -bump ing.  However, i t is impossible to determine  if a pilot had made an 
inappropriate  cyclic control input without a flight data recorder on  board that records the 
pilot's inputs leading up to the bre ak-up.  In respo nse to a number of unexplained  fatal 
accidents involving Robinson helicopters, the Commission has made a recommendation to the 
Ministry of Transport that it  promote the  installation of lightweight flight data or video 
recorder s42 in small  helicopters , in an effort to collect data that would help to determine the 
cause s of similar  accident s. 
4.4.3.  A common factor  identified in some early mast -bumping and in -flight break -up accidents was 
that the pilots were relatively inexperienced on helicopters  and had more experience flying 
aeroplanes (see Appendix 6, safety notice 29).  However , in New Zealand , recent mast -
bumping accidents43 have involved pilots with significant experience on Robinson helicopters 
and very little experience on aeroplanes, which  suggests  that other factors are involved.   
4.4.4.  Certain  flight control inputs used by pilots in aeroplanes, such as pushing forward on a control 
column to descend , can become  automatic  over time.  Such control input s can produce a low -
G or weightless44 conditi on felt by the occupants as strain against their seat belts , which is 
generally safe in an aeroplane.  However, these habits should not be transferred and used in 
helicopter s, as the low -G condition can lead to mast -bumping in a two -blade d, semi -rigid, 
teetering rotor system.  The pilot of a Robinson helicopter must make gentle movements of 
the cyclic control and use the collective lever45 to descend to avoid inducing an inadvertent 
low-G condition or aggravating it in turbulent conditions.   
4.4.5.  The pilot did n ot have a lot of experience on  Robinson helicopters , but he  had completed 
safety awareness training for the R22 . He should have  been aware of the risk of applying an 
inappropriate  cyclic control input and w as unlikely to have done  this intentionally .  However, if 
a pilot were  suddenly surprised by something, such as an impending collision with a bird or 
another aircraft, or if a helicopter suddenly roll ed or pitche d to an extreme angle, a natural or 
instinctual reaction could  result in an abrupt control input to avoid a conflict or correct an 
unusual attitude.   
4.4.6.  Pilots must also try to prevent inadvertent cyclic inputs during severe turbulence when 
unrestrained arms and legs can move the cyclic control, which would be particularly difficult in 
a near -weightless condition or right roll during a low -G encounter.   A lightly loaded helicopter 
would also be more susceptible to being 'bounced' around in turbulence.   
4.4.7.  The pilot was relatively  inexperience d on helicopters , but had flown Robins on helicopters 
exclusively , and learnt to fly in the mountains of the South Island  where turbulence is 
common .  Although he had more experience flying aeroplanes  than helicopters,  he was also  
relatively inexperienced  in flying aeroplanes .  It was not possible  to establis h whether  the pilot 
made a control input that contributed to  the in-flight break -up, and it could not be excluded  as 
a potential factor .

44 A low -G condition occurs when an object is subjected to a net vertical force less than the force of gravity. When the 
vertical force is zero, the object is described as being 'weightless'.   
45 The collective lever changes the ang le of attack of all main rotor blades simultaneously, thus changing the amount of 
lift produced by the main rotor making the helicopter climb or descend .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  Finding  
3. An abrupt, inappropriate  or inadvertent  cyclic control input by the pilot  could 
not be ruled out  as havin g contributed to the in -flight break -up. 
4.5.      Low-G in turbulence  
4.5.1.  The weather forecast for the Tasman area at the time of the flight , and the report given by the 
owner in the second helicopter , suggested that the pilot would have experienced moderate 
turbul ence along the route flown,  particularly around the Flora S addle area.  It was also likely  
that he encountered patches of isolated severe turbulence , which had been  predicted in  the 
SIGMET warning issued for the time  of the flight.  
4.5.2.  Robinson had first issue d a safety notice in regard to flying in strong  winds or turbulence  in 
1998  (see Appendix 6, safety notice 32) , which recommended  in part : 
Flying in high winds or turbulence should be avoided  [this sentence was added  in February  
2016 ] 
1. Reduce power and use a slower than normal cruise speed.   Mast bumping is less likely at 
lower airspeeds.  
2. For significant turbulence, reduce airspeed to  60-70 knots . 
3. Tighten seat belt and rest right forearm on right leg to minimise unintentional control 
inputs.  
4. Do not overcont rol. Allow aircraft to go with turbulence, then restore level flight with 
smooth, gentle control inputs.  
5. Avoid flying on  the downwind side of hills, ridges, or tall buildings where turbulence will 
likely be most severe.    
4.5.3.  The R44 flight manual  contained th e following caution  in the 'Normal Procedures : Cruise ' 
section : 
CAUTION  
If turbulence is expected, reduce power and  
use a slower than normal cruise  speed  
4.5.4.  The flight tracking information and the data recovered from the on -board GPS unit showed 
that the pilot was flying at  70-90 knots groundspeed for most of the flight.  Allowing for a 10 -
20 knot tailwind based on  the forecast wind speed and dir ection, the pilot would have kept to  
an airspeed of 60 -70 kno ts for most of the flight.  This  suggested that he slowed down  as per 
the safety notice and the caution in the flight manual,  very likely due to experiencing 
significant  turbulence during the flight .   
4.5.5.  As the pilot flew up the Flora Stream towards the Flora S addle his groundspeed was about 83 
knots, and as  the forecast wind was a direct crosswind from right to left at this point, this 
would  have also been  close to his  airspeed . Shortly after crossing the r idge to the south of the 
Flora S addle , the helicopter turned to the right towards the downwind side of Mt Arthur and 
started to  slow down  and descend.  The helicopter then flew toward s the more turbulent air in 
the lee of Mt Arthur and increased  its descent  once it was northeast of the summit .  The wind 
was coming from the opposite direction, the southwest.   The turn to the right may have been 
made to avoid cloud in the Flora Saddle  area , and the start of the descent could have been 
intentional in order to descend over the lower terrain in the Pearce River valley to find 
smoother air beneath.  The increase i n descent could also  have been due to a downdraught  
produced by the disturbed  airflow over Mt Arthur.  
4.5.6.  Turbulence, updraught s and downdraught s are present in mountainous areas when there are 
strong win ds above  about 15 knots.  T he severity and amount of turbulence depend on the 
height and shape of the land and the direction  from which  the wind is coming.  Steep ridges 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 and mountains with long and sharp peaks, together with a strong wind at a perpendicular 
angle to the terrain , produce the worst turbulence conditions.  Updraught s are created on the 
upwind side of mountains and valleys, which are relatively smooth , and increase the G-
loading46 on an aircraft when first encountered.  Downdraught s and turbulence are created on 
the downwind or lee side of mountai ns and valleys, producing  unstable 'rough' air , and reduce 
the G -loading  on an aircraft when first encountered.  
4.5.7.  With the forecast wind of 30 -40 knots from the southwest there would have been moderate to 
severe turbulence in the lee of and below the height of Mt Arthur , extending  to the northeast 
of its summit  and below 6 ,000 feet  above mean sea level .  The helicopter increased its 
descent then broke  up to the northeast of Mt Arthur at an altitude of about 3 ,800 feet .  The 
owner  (who was flying the second , heavier helicopter ) experienced moderate turbulence at  
about  the same altitude  over the Flora carpark , which increased after passing the Saddle.  The 
Flora carpark was  also to the northeast of Mt Arthur , but further away  from it and on the 
windward side o f a ridgeline .  It was very likely that the pilot experienced moderate to severe 
turbulence as he crossed the ridge to the south of the Flora Saddle , and he likely  encountered 
a severe  downdraught  in the lee of Mt Arthur  and the ridgeline he had just cross ed. 
4.5.8.  Moderate turbulence can produce G-loading  fluctuations of +/- 0.5-1.0G, while in severe 
turbulen ce the fluctuations can be greater than  +/- 1.0G47.  Turbulence is normally in isolated 
patches , however, and encountered momentarily as the aircraft flies through it into 'clean ' air.  
Severe  downdraught s can  initially  produce a reduct ion of up to 1G, providing a  weightless 
condition of  zero G.  Downdraught s can also last longer than turbulence, so a reduced or low -G 
condition c ould persist .  The pilot likely encountered a s evere  downdraught , whic h would have 
likely reduced the G -loading  on the helicopter (by 0.5G to 1G ) to a near weightless condition , 
over a period of several seconds .  
Finding s 
4. The actual wind and turbulence at the time  of the accident were very likely 
to have been the same as, or stronger  than, the forecast  conditions .   
5. The helicopter very likely encountered moderate to severe turbulence and 
an associated  severe  downdraught  in the lee of Mt Arthur , which likely 
created a prolonged low-G condition.  
 
History of  low-G mast -bump ing 
4.5.9.  Mast-bumping was first discovered  in the 1960s as the result of a number of unexplained 
accidents that occurred whilst  pilots were  training for , and in action during , the V ietnam war.  
The United States A rmy was losing helicopters on a regular basis w hile they were  being flown  
at low level s over undulating  terrain.  The type s of helicopter involved were  the Bell UH -1 
'Iroqu ois' and Bell AH-1 'Cobra' , which both had two-bladed , semi -rigid teetering main rotor s.  
It was determined that the in -flight break -ups of these helicopters were cause d by low -G mast -
bumping that had been induced by the pilot s' flying techniques.   
4.5.10.  Other helicopter types in use at t he time , including the Hughes OH -648, had rigid rotor head s 
and were not susceptible to low -G mast -bumping as they did not teeter.  Pilots of these 
helicopters flew them in a similar way to aeroplanes when flying over and following low terrain 
in that they pushed forward on the cyclic control s to descend over ridges and hills.  When 
pilots of Bell helicopters did this aggressively , the subsequent low-G condition s sometimes led 
to mast -bumping and catastrophic failure of the rotor system s.  A technique involv ing the use 
                                                        
46 G-force is the force of g ravity or weight acting on an object. When s tationary or in balanced f light an aircraft 
experiences 1 G; so does a human being standing still.  
47 Refer  International Civil Aviation Organization and World Meteorological O ffice turbulence code table and categories.  
48 The Hughes OH -6 was later developed into a civilian variant called the Hughes 500 , which is commonly used in New 
Zealand, particularly around mountainous terrain because it handles turbulence well . 
 

<< Page 21 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  of the collective lever to climb and descend over undulating terrain was introduced for the Bell 
types to avoid low -G conditions, and mast -bumping accidents w ere almost eliminated . 
4.5.11.  Bell Helicopter  made a commercial variant of the UH -1, designated the B205.  It also 
developed a smaller civilian utility helicopter called the B206 ' JetRanger'49, which used a two-
bladed , semi -rigid main rotor system similar to the one s on the UH -1 and B205.  Neither the 
B205 nor the B206 had issues with low -G mast -bumping in service, and the problems with the 
military models were put down to aggressive flying at low level s and cyclic pushovers that led 
to the in -flight break -ups. 
4.5.12.  There were relatively few case s of in-flight break -up caused by low -G mast -bump ing in the 
1970s, even though there were a number of helicopters in civilian use with  two-bladed , semi -
rigid teetering  rotors.  These were mostly  the Bell helicopter series , including the  older  Bell 
4750 and the Hiller UH -12 helicopter s51.   
Robinson helicopters  
4.5.13.  In the early 1980s the Robinson R22 entered service and was frequently used as a training or 
private aircraft due to its lower operating costs.  A number of unexplained in -flight break -up 
accidents started to occur  throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s.   
4.5.14.  The majority of the se accidents involved the R22 helic opter , and this prompted the FAA  to 
carry out a special review of the R22 certification process in the early 1980s and again in the 
early 1990s. A main rotor flapping survey was carried out by the manufacturer in 1982 for the 
R22, and in 1995 for the R44.  After reviewing the survey results t he FAA found that the R22  
and R44  were safe "when flown within its operating limitations ", and Robinson subsequently 
added a  limitation in th e flight manual that prohibited cyclic pushovers.   
4.5.15.  Concerned with the number of 'loss of rotor control' accidents involving the R22, the NTSB 
opened  an investigation  into the certification and flight characteristics of the R22 and R44  in 
1994  (see Appendi x 3).  The NTSB  subsequently recommended to the FAA that it introduce 
special training for pilots of Robinson helicopters and impose limitations on their operation 
until a study was carrie d out into the causes of the loss of rotor control and the dynamic 
behaviour  of the Robinson rotor system.  The study was partially completed but ended due to 
lack of funds . Crucially , the dynamic behaviour  of the Robinson rotor system during  low-G 
mast -bumping was not fully explored.   
4.5.16.  The R22 flight manual contains the following message  as required by FAA AD 95 -26-04: 
Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions  
and aircraft characteristics that lead to main rotor blade/  
fuselage contact accidents, and corrective type design  
changes and operating limitations are identified, Model  
R22 pilots are strongly urged to become familiar with the  
following information and comply with these recommended  
procedures:  
Mast Bumping:  Mast bumping may occur with a teetering  
rotor system when excessive main rotor flapping resul ts 
from low "G"  (load factor below 1.0) or abrupt control  
input. A low "G" flight condition can result from an abrupt  
cyclic pushover in forward flight. High forward airspeed,  
turbulence, and excessive sideslip can accentuate the  
adverse effects of these c ontrol movements. The excessive  
flapping results in the main rotor hub assembly striking  
the main rotor mast with subsequent main rotor system  
                                                        
49 The B206 'JetRanger ' has been used in New Zealand since the late 1970s in a number of roles including search and 
rescue, ag ricultural spraying, scenic flights, firefighting and training.  
50 The Bell 47 was a two -seat training and utility helicopter first flown in 1945 and used in New Zealand since the early 
1960s by the Royal New Zealand Air Force  for training, and in the civil ian sector for deer recover y and commercial work  in 
the mountains . 
51 The Hiller UH -12 has been used in New Zealand since the late 1950s for commercial work, and was also used in the 
mountains for deer  capture and  recovery.

 Final report AO -2014 -006 separation from the helicopter.  
To avoid these conditions, pilots are strongly urged to follow  
these recommendations:  
1) Maintain cruise airspeeds between 60 [knots] and less than 0.9 Vne, but 
no lower than 57 [knots] … 
2) Avoid large, rapid forward cyclic inputs in forward flight, and abrupt 
control inputs in turbulence.  
4.5.17.  The FAA issued Airworthiness Directives for both  the R22 and R44 (see Appendix 7 ) in 1995 
that mandated special awareness training52 for both types .  The training  included the subject 
of low -G mast -bumping , and minimum levels of experience  were introduced before a pilot 
could manipulat e the fligh t controls or fly solo.  The following limitations were  incorporated 
into the flight manual s of the R22 and R44 , and applied to  pilots with less t han 200 hours on 
helicopters or  less than 50 hours on Robinson helicopters:  
1. Flight when surface winds exceed 25 knots, including gusts, is prohibited.  
2. Flight when surface wind gust spreads exceed 15 knots is prohibited.  
3. Continued flight in moderate, severe, or extreme turbulence is prohibited.  
                 The following  flight manual  limitation applied to all  pilots of R22 and R44 helicopters:  
Adjust forward airspeed to between 60 knots indicated  
airspeed (KIAS) and 0.7 Vne  but no lower than 57 KIAS,  
upon inadvertently encountering moderate, severe, or  
extreme turbulence  
4.5.18.  The flight manual  limitations were later removed from the R44 as it was deemed to be a more 
stable design than the R22.  The decision was based on the accident  rates of the R44 , which 
were not as high as the R22 , and the fact that the R44 had not had the same issues with 
main rotor loss of contr ol that affected the R22 .  However, t he special awareness training  
requirement remained for  the R44  in the United States , and in 2009 the FAA made it 
permanent for both the R22 and the R4453. 
New Zealand situation  
4.5.19.  In New Zealand the CAA adopted the  limitations and  special awareness training requirements 
for the R22  and R44 , although it called it safety awareness training and made some minor 
change s to the wording (see Appendix 7 ).  The CAA change d the wording of the wind speed 
limitation to remove the word 'surface', which meant that any wind above 25 knots would 
prohibit flying for a pilot with less than the minimum flight experience of 200 hours on 
helicopter s or 50 hours on type.  The CAA  initially applied t he limitations to the R44  as well , 
but then  followed the FAA by  removing the limitation s from the R44 in 2004.  The CAA also 
removed the safety awareness training requirement for the R44  at the same time . 
4.5.20.  Had th ose limitation s still applied to the R44 at t he time of the accident, the pilot would have 
been prohibited from carrying out the flight as he had less than 200 hours on helicopters and 
because the wind speed was over 25 knots. He would have also b een prohibited from 
continuing the  flight if he had encountered moderate turbulence.   If he had been flying an R22 
the flight would have been  prohibited , as those  limitations still applied  to that model.

6. Had a previous  limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 
pilots remained in place , as per that for R22 pilots , the pilot would have 
been p rohibited from flying at the time  of the accident due to the forecast 
strong  winds  and turbulence . 
 
4.5.21.  The rate of low-G mast -bumping accident s in New Zealand has increased since the early 
1990s, and i n the period 201 2-2015 there were s ix low-G mast -bumping occurrences  (see 
Appendix 5).  There ha ve been no reported accidents in New Zealand that occurred as a result 
of low -G, involving a type of helicopter other than the Robinson.  There are nearly  900 
helicopters flying in New Zealand, with Robinson models  making up over a third of this 
number.  Two bladed , semi-rigid teetering rotor helicopters , including Bell models, account for  
over half of all helicopters in New Zealand54.  According to t he CAA's database of helicopter 
accidents, the rate of loss -of-control accidents, which include mast -bumping, has increased 
since the year 2000, while rates for most of the other categories  have stayed the same or 
reduced.  The number of Robinson helicopters i n New Zealand has tripled in the same period.  
4.5.22.  In response to  the increased rate of mast -bumping , and two recommendation s made by the 
Commission in 201455, the CAA  in 2015 reviewed the content and delivery of the safety 
awareness training for the R22  in New Zealand and  how the requirements issued by the FAA 
were being implemented.  The result  of the review  was that training standards and experience 
requirements were brought in  to line with those in the United States, and the R44 was 
included in the sa fety awareness training.  The  wind  limitations remained unchanged and still 
only apply to the R22.  In the consultation document for the proposed changes, the R66 was 
to be included in the safety awareness training, but after the submission process the CAA  
decided not to include the R66.  
4.5.23.  As a result of the increase in the rate of low-G mast -bumping accidents involving Robinson 
helicopters, the Commission decided to add this issue  to its ' Watchlist'56 in August 2016. Low-
G mast-bumping accidents involving Robinson helicopters  will be closely monitored in New 
Zealand to help identify a ll of the factors contributing to this problem . 
R44 and R66 Models  
4.5.24.  There have been several recent in -flight break -up accidents involving R44 and R66 types in  
the United States , Asia and Europe .  An accident in France that occurred on 3  September 
2012 involved an R44 with two people on  board that broke up in  flight while flying over 
mountainous terrain in high winds.  The accident report  included  a Safety  Recommendation to  
amend the flight manual s of the R22 and R44 to include information relating to flight in 
turbulence in the 'Limitations ' section57. 
4.5.25.  All three Robinson types  share the same  basic  rotor design and flight control components , and 
are subject to the same dynamic forces .  The higher overall rate of R22 accidents can in part 
be explained by their use as training helicopter s and the level of experience of their pilots.  
However, all three types have now been involved in low -G mast -bumping accidents58, and the 
same ris k of encountering low -G conditions  in turbulence applies to all of them.  
4.5.26.  With a lower rotor loading and less inertia , small  helicopters  like the R22  are more  prone  to 
low-G conditions in turbulence .  Large r helicopters such as  the R44 and R66  are also

 Final report AO -2014 -006 susc eptible to turbulence when lightly loaded , as was the case with the helicopter in this 
accident.   This is recognised in Robinson Safety Notice 32 (see Appendix 6)  High Winds and 
Turbulenc e, which  was amended in May 2013 and Feb ruary  2016 , after one R66 and  two 
R44 in -flight break -ups occurred in New Zealand .  The following words were added:  
 Flying in high winds or turbulence should be avoided  [added Feb ruary  2016)  
 The helicopter is more susceptible to turbulence at light weight. Reduce 
speed and use caution  when flying solo or lightly loaded  [added May 2013]  
4.5.27.  The Safety Notice s produced by Robinson apply to all three models, the R22 , the R44 and the 
R66.  Likewise, the same cauti ons regarding abrupt control movements and cyclic pushovers, 
and the prohibition of low -G pushovers , appear in all three flight manuals.  The manufacturer 
recognised that these same risks applied across the three models and treated them the same 
when issuing safety notices and cautions.  However, the training and experience requirement s 
and limitations in  regard to flying in  turbulence had not been extended by the airworthiness 
authorities to cover all three models . 
Finding  
7. All three Robinson helicopter models are susceptible to low -G mast -
bumping, and any preventive  measures should app ly to all of them . 
 
4.6.      Low-G right roll  in Robinson helicopters  
4.6.1.  Test pilots flying the Robinson helicopters during certification, and instructors who had 
previously demonstrate d59 the effects of low -G to students , discovered that all three models 
had a tendency to roll to the right in low -G condition s, in some situations very rapidly.  During 
the safety awareness training given to pilots, an instructional video supplied by Robinson 
states that in some cas es the rate of right roll can reach nearly  100 degrees per second  in 
less than a second60.   
4.6.2.  A helicopter with a single main rotor is fitted with a tail rotor to counteract the torque reaction 
from the engine driving the main rotor, otherwise the helicopter would spin uncontrollably in 
the opposite dire ction to the main rotor .  The tail rotor 's thrust  stops the helicopter spinning  
clockwise , but it creates a sideways thrust as a result and would make the helicopter dr ift in 
the same direction as the thrust.  I n the case of Robinson helicopters  this is to  the right (see 
Figure 7). 
                                                        
59 Demonstrat ions of  the effects of low -G in flight used to be carried out by in structors, but due to a number  of incidents 
and one fatal accident during  a demonstration they were determined  to be too risky , and the effects  should  only be 
discussed on the ground now .

Figure 7  
Tail rotor drift  (source: FAA)  
4.6.3.  The horizontal tail rotor thrust acts in a line that is above the helicopter 's centre of gravity , 
which if not compensated for would make the helicopter roll to the right. The  sideways drift 
and roll are counteracted in flight by tilting the main rotor to the left slightly to produce a 
sideways component in the lift produced by the main rotor, which o ffsets the right drift  and 
right roll from the tail rotor.  
4.6.4.  For the R44, the  angle of the left tilt or teeter of the main rotor to offset tail rotor drift  and 
correct the dissymmetry of lift across the main rotor  is typically about  3 degrees in the 
cruise61.  This leaves  about  4.4 degrees of movement before the main rotor blade spindles 
contact  the teeter stops at a combined total of 7.4  degrees of teetering.  The maximum 
amount of teetering from the horizontal , before the blade spindles strike the driveshaft  or 
mast, is 15.1 degrees.   
4.6.5.  The helicopter is ' under slung' at the teeter hinge , with its weight hanging from the teeter bolt.  
The main rotor provides a lifting force upwards and slightly to the left , which keeps the 
helicopter upright against the force of gr avity and the tail rotor right roll, through a balanced  
pivot point at the teeter hinge.  In a low -G condition , the main rotor  loading  is reduced and the 
forces a re no longer in balance.  There is n ot as much weight acting in a downwards direction  
to keep the helicopter slung upright underneath the main rotor, so the tail rotor thrust starts to 
roll the helicopter to th e right.  During a downdraught  or cyclic pushover, the angle of attack of 
the main  rotor blades is decreased  due to the change in relative airflow  (see Figure 8), and the 
amount of lift produced by the main rotor is reduced.  As a result, the rotor is further unloaded 
and t he sideways component of lift is reduced , allowing  the tail roto r to roll the aircraft even 
faster to the right.  
                                                        
61 The a ctual angle depends on the airspeed  and lateral centre of gravity;  at a speed of 40 knots the angle is about 4 
degrees, and at a speed of 120 knots it is about 2 degrees (based on a rotor flapping survey carried out by Robinson - 
RTR473).

 Final report AO -2014 -006  
Figure 8  
Change of relative airflow in a downdraught  (source: FAA)  
4.6.6.  Another factor that affects the rate of tail rotor roll is the height of the tail in relation to the 
nose of the helicopter.  The higher the tail , the greater the distance the tail rotor thrust line will 
be above the helicopter's centre of gravity , which  results in  a faster roll rate.  This is one of the 
reasons why Robinson r ecommend s slowing  down in turbulence, as a lower speed equates to 
a lower  tail (see Appendix 8) .  A slower speed also requires  less power from the engine, so less 
thrust will be needed from the tail rotor to counteract the torque reaction , and the rate of roll 
will be slower . 
Aerodynamic and rotor dynamic  factors  during  low-G in severe turbulence  
4.6.7.  There have been no survivors of turbulen ce-related  low-G mast -bumping ac cidents, and there 
is a lack of eye witnesses and evidence to confirm what exactly happens if a right roll fully 
develops in severe turbulence  or downdraughts .  The Commission has previously 
recommended to the FAA that the study into two -bladed , semi -rigid rotor system dynamic 
behaviour, including the effects of low -G, be reinstat ed and complete d62.  Until this  is done, 
the actu al behaviour of these rotor systems  during prolonged or severe  low-G encounters will 
not be fully understood.  The following  paragraphs discuss  factors  that are considered likely to 
contribut e to an in -flight break -up during  low-G-conditions  in severe  turbulence.  
4.6.8.  In a severe downdraught  the weight acting on the main rotor is reduce d by the sudden 
decrease in the G - loading , and the reduction in the angle of attack  rapidly decreases the 
aerodynamic drag  on the main rotor  blades.  This would unload the  main rotor and therefore 
the engine , which  would decrease the torque reaction experienced by the helicopter.  The tail 
rotor would then be  producing more thrust than required to ba lance the  lower torque reaction 
from the eng ine, and  the res ult would  be a faster right roll  due to  the excess  thrust from the 
tail rotor.  
4.6.9.  Low-G conditions due to  cyclic  pushovers  are likely  to occur  at a slower rate and  can be quickly  
corrected by removing the forward cyclic input and apply ing gentle aft cyclic to 'reload' the 
main rotor .  In most situations  when  turbulence is encountered it is momentary, and the 
helicopter flies through the  rough air into smooth air , reloading the main rotor.  In both cases 
the effects of low -G are only experi enced briefly  and the right roll produ ced by the tail rotor 
does not fully develop , and stops once the rotor is reloaded. However, if a s evere  downdraught  
is encountered the low -G condition may persist for longer , allowing the tail rotor roll to fully 
deve lop and reach a high rate . 
4.6.10.  Because the main rotor is unloaded when the tail rotor thrust rolls the hel icopter , it does  not 
roll with the rest of the helicopter and initially  remain s level.  The main ro tor disc behave s like 
a gyroscope and  would  remain  in its  plane of rotation until a pitch change  were  made to  the 
blades to  change it .  After a short delay , the main rotor disc would start to follow the  tilting 
driveshaft  due to the changing angles of attack on  the blades.  The angle of attack of the aft

 Final report AO -2014 -006  blade would decrease and the forward blade's would increase due to the right tilting hub63, 
which would result in a right tilt of the rotor disc.   However, d uring flight testing at high 
airspeeds in normal (1G) flight, maximum roll rates  through pitch angle  changes  were between 
40 and 60 degrees per second , which  is significantly less than the roll rates due to low-G (see 
4.6.1. and 4.6.12.) . 
4.6.11.  Once mast -bumping starts, a driveshaft that is tilting to the right begins to contact the main 
rotor blade spindle s.  The main rotor driveshaft is now trying to force the rotor disc to tilt to the 
right ; however , this force is transmitted 90 degrees in the direction of rotation due to 
gyroscopic precession, which in the case of the Robinson is anticlockwise when viewed f rom 
above.  The resultant force would make the rotor disc tilt forward, and again have  the same 
effect as a cyclic pushover, making the low -G condition worse and aggravating the right roll.   
4.6.12.  During a study commissioned by the FAA and carried out by the Georgia Institute of 
Tech nology  in the United States in 199564, a mathematical  model65 was used to  assess  the 
effects of  flight control inputs and reduced G conditions to try to understand what happens 
during mast -bumping  in R22s .  It was calculated that during a low -G condition caused by a 
cyclic pushover lasting one second , after half a second the roll  rate and teetering angle s 
increase ra pidly once the G -loading reduces  to less than 0.5G , and the teeter stops are  
conta cted a 10th  of a second later.  The  calculated ma ximum roll rate was over 100 degrees 
to the right, and severe mast -bumping would have occurred after  0.1G was reached  in less 
than  a second.  
4.6.13.  The main rotor flapping surveys carried out by Robinson for the R22, R44  and R66 confirmed 
the high r ates of roll that can be encountered during low -G conditions. The survey test flights 
included cyclic pushovers that caused a momentary  reduction in G to between +0.3 G and 
+0.6 G, followed by an immediate aft cyclic recovery to reload the main rotor disc. Despite  
highly experienced  test pilots  conduct ing these tests , and the ant icipated reduction in G that 
allowed  them to prepare  for and make a prompt  recovery, the teeter limits were exc eeded  for 
both  the R44 and the R66 .  Roll ra tes of up to 40 degrees per second were recorded during 
the brief excursions into reduced G .  A sudden and sustained reduction in G  below +0.3G 
would very likely lead to much higher roll rates and severe mast bumping.  
Effects of Robinson main rotor design during a low -G right roll  
4.6.14.  When a  Robinson  helicopter rolls to the right and its main  rotor remain s level , as is the case 
initially with a right roll due to low -G, the pitch angle s of the main rotor blades are changed  
through the pitch change links  (see Figure  9).  This  secondary effect  is du e to the Robinson 
rotor design  (see Appendix 4), as the pitch ch ange horn is  located outboard of  the teeter hinge  
axis.  This delta -three offset66 arrangement introduces a teetering  (flap) -pitch coupling of the 
main rotor blades, wher e a change in the teetering angle changes the pitch angle of the rotor 
blades.  Other two -bladed , semi -rigid rotor designs such as  that of  the B ell 206 (see Appendix 
4) have the pitch change input closer to  or in line with  the teeter hinge  axis, so if the d riveshaft  
is tilted due to turbulence or  low-G, the change in blade pitch a ngle is smaller in comparison, 
or in some cases is non-existent.  
                                                        
63 When the hub is aligned with the helicopter in a fore and aft direction, the hub is forced to tilt with the driveshaft as 
the teeter hinge bolt is perpendicular to the axis of ro ll. When the hub is in a left to right orientation, the hub is allowed to 
teeter as the teeter bolt is now parallel to the roll axis.

65 The m athematical model was not validated by comparison with fligh t test  data  as this was not available  
66 Robinson designs include a delta -three offset or lag of about 18 degrees in the pitch change input, so instead of it 
being made 90  degrees  in advance to com pensate for gyroscopic precession, it is made 72  degrees  in advance. This is to 
eliminate some 'undesirable characteristics' of rotor discs  as they tilt forward, and during flight  at high airspeeds.

Figure 9  
Teeter  (flap) -pitch coupling  (delta -three hinge)  and contact between pitch  link and pitch change horn  
 
4.6.15.  During normal operations  with a vertical driveshaft , the teetering  (flapping)  to compensate for 
dissymmetry of lift across the rotor disc produces low teetering angles and a small teeter  (flap ) 
-pitch coupling.  However, during  a low -G right roll with a tilting driveshaft,  high t eetering 
angles and a larger teeter -pitch coupling is produced.   The increase in the pitch angle on the 
rearward travelling blade creates a higher angle of attack and more lift, while the forward 
travelling blade experiences a decrease in angle of attack a nd less lift.  The result is a force 
trying to tilt the blade to the right ; however , due to gyroscopic precession  (see Figure 10) the 
rotor disc will tilt forward , creating the same effect as a cyclic pushover and a worsening of the 
low-G condition.  
4.6.16.  Another unique design feature of the Robinson rotor head is that the pitch horn input is 
inboard of the coning hinge  axis (see Figure 9  and Appendix 4) , which means that a change in 
a blade's coning angle  results in a change to  its pitch angle. During  the low-G conditions in the 
main rotor flapping  survey flights , while  the main rotor wa s partially unloaded, t he coning 
angle of both blades wa s reduced  by about 5 degrees , which would result in a decrease in the 
pitch angle of both blades by about 2 degrees. Although a small decrease, it would reduce the 
lift produced by the main rotor during low -G conditions and lead to  a further reduction in G.

 Final report AO -2014 -006  4.6.17.  At some point after the mast -bumping starts and the rotor hub has teetered beyond the limits, 
the pitch change links fail due to excessive reverse bending cycles  and compression loads , 
likely  after contact  with the pitch change horns  (see Figure s 9 and 1 1) due to the limited range 
of movement the connection allows67.  This would render the main rotor blades uncontrollable  
in pitch,  and they could  assume extreme positive or negative angles of attack , causing  rotor 
divergence .  The centre of gravity of the bla des is forward of the pitch change axis, which 
creates pitch instability  during blade rotation .  A blade rotating with a negative  angle of attack 
produces lift  in a downwards direction  and would bend down into the cabin and underneath 
the helicopter with the airflow.   
 
Figure 11  
Contact between the pitch link and the pitch horn at the teeter limit (7.4 degrees)  
4.6.18.  When a main rotor blade  strikes the cabin and skids  under rotation , a massive torque 
overload occurs on the driveshaft , leading to a torsional failure and separation of the main 
rotor system.  In the scenario described above, t he time taken from e ntering the low -G 
condition and the  development of the right roll , to the mast -bump ing and main rotor 
separation , would  likely be under a second , which is  less than the reaction time of an alert 
pilot.  
Finding  
8. Due to their unique main rotor design, d uring  a sudden and prolonged low -
G condition Robinson helicopter s can roll rapidly to the right and likely 
break  up before a pilot can recover . 
 
Low-G recovery techniques  
4.6.19.  When the tendency of Robinson helicopters to roll to the right during low -G conditions was first 
discovered, a recovery technique was developed by the manufacturer.  During flight testing the 
low-G condition was induced by slowly pushing forward on the cyc lic, which led to a right roll.  
This was relatively easy to anticipate and negate by removing the forward cyclic input to stop 
the low -G condition worsening, and applying gentle aft cyclic to 'reload' the rotor dis c before 
the right roll developed  further .   
4.6.20.  Once the rotor disc was reloaded the cyclic could be moved to the left to level the helicopter.  
However, i f the cyclic were  moved to the left before the rotor disc was reloaded , the main rotor 
                                                        
67 Other two -blade d helicopters, such as  the Bell 206 , incorporate a connection that allows the main rotor to teeter well 
beyond the limits before the pitch link contacts the horn, meaning a mast separation is likely to happen before a rotor 
divergence can occur . 
 


<< Page 30 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 would respond to the cyclic input and tilt to the left  but the helicopter  would not  follow , which 
could lead to a mast -bump.  
4.6.21.  The main issue with using this recovery technique  during a low -G situation  is that applying aft 
cyclic  is not a pilot 's natural reaction to  a sudden right roll .  During an un expect ed abrupt roll 
to the right, the pilot 's most instinctive  reaction would be to tr y to level the helicopter  by 
applying left cyclic.  If the pilot did this in a low -G-induced abrupt right roll , the result could be 
mast -bumping and an in -flight break -up.   
4.6.22.  Following t he prohibition of in -flight low-G demonstrations and  practising low -G recovery 
techniques, the training of pilots  on what to do in the event of encountering low -G was 
confined to verbal briefings only .  The prohibition has likely  made it harder for pilots to  
recognise a low-G-induced roll and for them to resist the most instinctive reaction  to that  roll.  
Instead t hey are told to use a technique that is not  intuitive  and not allowed to be 
demonstrated or practiced  in-flight.  
4.6.23.  In some  of the early mast -bumping accidents attributed to low -G, the suspected cause of the 
in-flight break -up was  an 'incorrect ' recovery technique applied by the pilot , such as moving 
the cyclic to the left while the rotor disc was still unloaded68.  However, in ev ery case it has not 
been  possible to determine if a pilot applied an incorrect recovery technique, applied the 
correct recovery technique, or did not have time to apply any recovery technique, before the 
helicopter broke up.  
4.6.24.  If a pilot is  not braced for turbulence, or even if braced during severe turbulence or 
downdraught s, the pilot 's unrestrained arms and legs  can move the cycli c unintentionally 
during a violent upset, which could lead to a mast -bump.   A pilot  with a  loosely restrained 
upper body is likely to remain upright initially during a  sudden  right roll , which could result in a 
left cyclic input as the helicopter rolls to the right.  The seat belt s normally69 used in Robinson  
helicopters  are three -point inertia reel automotive type units, which are not as effective in 
restraining occupant s' upper bodies  as four- or five -point harness es with fixed -length  self-
locking  lap belt s.  Although this was not a survivable accident, four - or five -point harnesses 
provide better restraint of occupants during accidents , and the ir use can reduce the severity of  
injuries.   
 
Finding  
9. A pilot's instinctive reaction to a n unexpected  right roll, or the unintentional  
movement of a pilot 's limbs or upper body  during severe turbulence  or low -
G, could lead to mast -bump ing. 
 
4.6.25.  The recovery technique published in the flight manual was proven to be effective during flight 
testing in low-G conditions down to about +0.3G , which produced  roll rates of up to 4 0 
degrees per second . However , the reduced G was  induced slowly and experienced 
momentarily , with the test pilot being able to anticipate the effects of the forward cyclic input 
and stop the roll before it fully developed.  In a low -G condition brought on by turbulence or a 
strong downdraught , a pilot may not be able to anticipate the sudden reduc tion in  G, and  the 
right roll may  occur suddenly and  fully develop d ue to a longer exposure to the condition .   
4.6.26.  In response to the ongoing occurrence of mast -bumping accidents , and due to doubts over the 
effec tiveness of the manufacturer 's technique, some helicopter instructors in New Zealand  
developed  or used alternative recovery techniques.   Their action s were also partially driven by

prohibition of low -G demonstrations . 
4.6.27.  The instructor  involved in  the first  R22 non-fatal mast -bumping incident in New Zealand  used  
a right cyclic  control input  to tilt the rotor disc to the right to 'follow' the helicopter that had 
rapidly roll ed to the right  and pitched nose -down .  This allowed him to prevent an in -flight 
break -up after mast -bumping began .  However, a  significant amount of height was lost during 
the recovery.  
4.6.28.  Another suggested technique involved lowering the collective lever to reduc e the amount of 
tail rotor thrust , by decreasin g engine  power through the correlat or70.  This recove ry technique 
require d co-ordination with the other flight controls, as a sudd en reduction in  the main rotor 
blade pitch angles  create s secondary effects.  The pitch angle of the tail rotors would have to 
be reduced through the tail rotor pedals , to avoid exc ess thrust acting against  the reduced 
torque reaction  and smaller horizontal  component of lift  from the main rotor.  
4.6.29.  The simultaneous  reduction of both  main rotor blade pitch angles would also lead to the rotor 
disc flapping forward71, and if not compensated for by  immediate ly applying  aft cyclic,  the 
nose of the helicopter would  drop and the low -G condition  could worsen .  
4.6.30.  In response to  the proposed alternative recovery techniques, Robinson Helicopters made the 
following comments about factors that can affect low -G conditions and the right roll:  
1. At slower speeds the effect of the turbulence, hence the amount of low -
G, is greatly reduced.  
2. Less power means less tail rotor thrust to roll the helicopter.  
3. At slower speeds the location of the tail rotor relative to the aircraft's 
centre of gravity will reduce rolling tendencies.  
There seems to be a growing perception in New Zealan d that lowering 
the collective is a preferable method and a more instinctive response to 
recover from a low -G condition.  
We think the most important focus should be on the weightless feeling 
caused by the low -G condition, which can occur before the roll e ven 
starts and is when a recovery should be initiated.  
Lowering the collective will cause a momentary pitching down of the 
nose, which could aggravate the roll.  
4.6.31.  Lowering the collective during a low -G condition will also further unload the rotor disc, delay ing 
the reloading of the disc  and th e recovery to level flight .  The reduction in lift from the main 
rotor  would also mean a greater loss of height during recovery.   The instructor involved in the 
second R22 non -fatal mast -bumping incident in New Zealand could only attempt a recovery by 
lowering  the collective , because  his student ' froze ' and  locked the cyclic control in a forward 
position.  Again, a significant amount of height was lost during the recovery , but the helicopter 
did not break -up and the pilot  was able to land safely.  
 
4.6.32.  The pilot of the helicopter in the Kahurangi accident was aware of  the alternative technique of 
lowering the collective during a low -G encou nter, as it had been discussed  during  his private 
pilot licence flight test .  However, he had been taught the manufacturer 's approved recovery 
technique during his Robinson safety awareness training.  T here is no way of knowing which 
recovery technique , if any,  he used prior to the break -up.   
                                                        
70 The correlat or (or anticipator)  helps  to control the engine RPM within a set range and is a link between  the collective 
lever  and the engine's fuel control unit . Lowering the collective lever unloads the main rotor blades and therefo re the 
engine, and the correlat or senses the lever movement and reduces the engine power through the fuel control unit to help 
keep the RPM constant. It is vice versa for raising the collective lever and loading the main rotor blades. There is a slight  
delay in its operation.  
71 When the angle of attack is reduced on the main rotor blades through the collective lever in forward flight, the amount 
of lift produced by the forward travelling blade is reduced more than  the rearward travelling blade, resulting in  the main 
rotor disc 'flapping forward' i .e. the front of the disc 'dives' due to gyroscopic precession.  The nose of the helicopter also 
drops due to the reduced downforce from the horizontal stabiliser, as a result of the decreased downwash from the rotor .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  
4.6.33.  The use of aft cyclic is not an intuitive reaction to  an unexpected and sudden right roll  (which 
in some cases can occur immediately  after low -G is first felt) , and this  technique has not been 
proven in severe or  prolonged low -G conditions .  However , the manufacturer 's low -G recovery 
technique has  been proven during  cyclic pushovers , and remains the only approved recovery 
technique.   The key to applying the manufacturer 's recovery technique successfully, is the 
early recognition or anticipation of low -G, and  the immediate gentle application of aft cyclic  
before the right roll develops . 
Finding  
10. Although not an intuitive reaction to a sudden right roll, the aft cyclic 
technique is the only approved recovery technique, and should be used as 
soon as low -G is felt to 'reload' the main rotor disc and help  reduce any 
right roll.  
 
4.7.   Conclusion s 
4.7.1.  The pilot had completed the necessary safety awareness training for Robinson helicopters,  
and had flown the helicopter within the limitations in place at the time of the accident.  The 
pilot had slowed the helicopter  down as recommended by the manufacturer during an 
encounter with moderate or severe  turbulence.  He had been taught the manufacturer 's 
approved recov ery technique, and was aware of  the alternative technique of lowering the 
collective during a low -G encounter .  However,  there is no way of knowing whether he used 
either  technique  during the event.   
4.7.2.  The helicopter was lightly loaded,  which would have made it more susceptible to tu rbulence 
and the effects of reduced G.  The helicopter  started to descend northeast of Mt Arthur and in 
the lee of a ridgeline it had just crossed.   It also turned to the right  towards the lee of Mt Arthur 
and very likely encountered a s evere  downdraught , possibly while i n a nose -low attitude72 due 
to an intentional  descent  by the pilot .  The combination of the above factors  occurring  at the 
same time led to a sudden onset of low -G and a rapid roll to the right that was likely to o fast 
for the pilot to recov er from , result ing in mast -bump ing and the in-flight  break -up. 
        
                                                        
72 The helicopter would initially assume a nose -low attitude during a descent, whether the pilot used cyclic or collective 
input alone to initiate it.

 Final report AO -2014 -006  5. Findings  
5.1. A mast -bump occurred, which led to rotor divergence and the in -flight break -up. 
5.2. The in -flight break -up was very unlikely to have been caused by low main rotor RPM  
(revolutions per minute) . 
5.3. An abrupt, inappropriate  or inadvertent  cyclic control input by the pilot could not be ruled out  
as havin g contributed to the in -flight break -up. 
5.4. The actual wind  and turbulence a t the time  and location  of the accident  were very l ikely to have 
been the same as, or stronger than , the forecast  conditions .   
5.5. The helicopter very likely encountered moderate to severe turbulence and an associated 
severe  downdraught  in the lee of Mt Arthur, which likely created a prolonged low-G condition .  
5.6. Had a previous  limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots remained in 
place , as per that for R22 pilots , the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the time of 
the accident due to the forecast strong winds and turbulence.  
5.7. All three Robinson helicopter models are susceptible to low -G mast -bumping, and any 
preventive  measures should apply to all of them.  
5.8. Due to their unique main rotor design, d uring a prolonged  or severe  low-G condition Robinson 
helicopters  can roll rapidly to the rig ht, and likely break  up before a pilot can recover . 
5.9. A pilot's instinctive reaction to a n unexpected  right roll, or the unintentional movement of a 
pilot's limbs or upper body  during severe turbulence  or low -G, could  lead to mast -bump ing. 
5.10.  Although  not an intuitive reaction to  a sudden right roll, the aft cyclic technique is the only 
approved recovery technique, and should be used as soon as low -G is felt to 'reload' the main 
rotor disc and help reduce any right roll .

 Final report AO -2014 -006 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator , a manufacturer  or an operator to address safety 
issues identified by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the 
Commission issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator , a manufacturer  or an operator  to address other 
safety issues that would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  
recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inqui ry 
6.2. Nil. 
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.3. In November 2016 Robinson released a Safety Alert ( see Appendix 11) regarding low-G mast -
bumping accidents, in response to a number of recent accidents worldwide involving the R44 
and the R66.  It drew attention to the prohibition of low-G pushover manoeuvres  and the 
importance of applying gentle aft cyclic as soon as low -G is felt, and stated that "Low-G 
induced right roll indicates you are losing control of the helicopter" .  Pilots are also reminded 
to slow down and avoid overreacting in turbulence.  
6.4. At the same time Robinson also published Service Bulletins for the R44 and the R66 that 
instructed operators to install a placard below the airspeed indicators which read s: 
DO NOT EXCEED 110 KIAS EXCEPT IN S MOOTH AIR  
This new 'maximum recommended airspeed' has been introduced to ensure that pilots slow 
down from the normally higher cruise speeds of 130 -140 Knots, to a safer cruise speed of 
110 Knots when experiencing turbulence.  
6.5. The Safety Al ert contains  previously published cautions regarding low -G pushovers and 
turbulence that are worth repeating, but they are already covered during the safety awareness 
training and are contained in the Safety Notices and  normal procedures in  the aircraft flight 
manual.  
6.6. The new maximum recommended cruise speed for turbulence is significantly higher than the 
60-70 knots that is recommended in Safety Notice 32 when experiencing 'significant 
turbulence'.  Although it is better to install an air speed limitation  placard like this in the 
cockpit, it  may create confusion regarding the most appropriate speed to use in turbulence , 
and lead a pilot to believe that this higher airspeed is allowable in moderate or greater 
turbulence.  
6.7. The pilot involved in this accident had slowed down to the recommended airspeed of 60 -70 
knots for significant turbulence, as published  in Safety Notice 32, yet still encountered mast -
bumping.  This suggests that more robust measures are required to reduce the risk  of low -G 
mast -bumping occurring  in turbulence .

 Final report AO -2014 -006  7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to the Fede ral Aviation 
Administration ( FAA), and th e Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA) . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Previous recommendations  
7.3. There have been a number of Safety Recommendations made  worldwide  as a result of 
previous mast -bumping accidents, which have resulted  in the introduction of  safety awareness 
training and the publishing of cautions  and Safety Notices  in the flight manuals  to stress  the 
dangers of low-G.  The following Safety Recommendations  related  to low -G mast -bump ing 
were made by the Commission between 2013 and 2016:  
Recommendations to the FAA : 
 amend  section 2(b) of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73 - Robinson R -22/R -44 
Special Training and Experience Requirements to make it clear that dual instruction in the 
'effects of low -G manoeuvers ' is limited to discussion only, and to reiterate that deliberate 
in-flight reduced G conditions are prohibited (003/15)  
 require Robinson Helicopter Company to amend its flight manuals to include the use of 
'Warning ' for those operating conditions and practices that involve a risk of personal injury 
or loss of  life (007/15)  
 extend the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 
73 to pilots of the Robinson R66 helicopter (004/16)  
 reinstate research into the dynamic behaviour of two -bladed, teetering, underslung rotor 
systems, taking full advantage of available technology, with the aim of achieving the 
original goal of National Transportation Safety Board  recommendation A -96-12 (005/16) . 
Recommendations to the CAA:  
 include the knowledge and training requirements of Special Feder al Aviation Regulation 
No. 73, or an equivalent requirement, as a prerequisite for the issue of a Robinson R66 
type rating (002/16)  
 promptly publicise the recent changes to the Robinson R66 (and R44) Pilot's Operating 
Handbooks that caution against flight in high winds and turbulence, and which advise 
pilots to reduce power and speed if turbulence is expected or encountered (011/16)  
Recommendations to the Ministry of Transport:  
 the Commission recommended to the Secretary for Transport that he promote, through the 
appropriate ICAO  (International Civil Aviation Organization)  forum, the need for cockpit 
video recorders and/or other forms of data capture in the cockpits of certain classes of 
helicopter to address this safety issue (014/16)  
Watchlist  
7.4. The Com mission maintains a 'Watch list' of the most pressing and current safety concerns in 
the three transport modes  that it investigates : rail, marine and air.  The Watchlist is published 
on the Commission's website and updated regularly to capture emerging safety issues.  In 
October 2016  the Commission added  'Robinson helicopters : mast bumping accidents in NZ ' to 
the Watchlist (see Appendix 12) , to reflect the Commission's growing concern at the number of 
unexplained mast -bumping accidents  involving Robinson  helicopters.  
 

<< Page 36 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 Recommendations  
7.5. There was an improvement in the low-G mast -bumping accident rates for Robinson helicopters  
after  special training and  limitations were introduced in the mid -1990s , but in  New Zealand 
the rate has remained high er than  in the Un ited States .  Worldwide, t here were  a number of 
low-G in-flight break -up accidents involving Robinson helicopters between 2011 and 2016 , 
and some  of these  involved  the R44 or R66 model.  
7.6. It is likely that in some  low-G situations , such as those found in sev ere turbulence and 
downdraught s, recovery  may not be possible, even for an experienced an d alert pilot.  
There fore there  need s to be a shift towards avoiding the conditions that can lead to these low-
G situations developing . 
Recommendation one  
7.7. The limitations that have been in place on the R22 since the mid -1990s have helped to 
reduce the rate of R22 low -G mast -bump accidents, prevented inexperienced pilots flying in 
moderate or greater turbulence, and made it compulsory to slow down in turbulen ce. 
7.8. Had a previous  limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots still been 
applicable , as per that for the R22, the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the 
time of the accident due to the forecast strong winds  and turbulence . 
7.9. The involvement of experienced pilots , and the R44 and R66 models , in recent mast -bumping 
accidents suggests  that those limitations should be extended to include the R44 and R66 , 
and to all pilots  of Robinson helicopters regardless of experience.  
7.10.  On 23 Feb ruary 2017  the Commission reco mmended to the Administrator of the  FAA that he:  
 extend the limitations and requirements of FAA AD 95-26-04 that currently apply to the 
R22, in regard to operating in strong  winds and turbulence, to the R44 and R66 models ; 
and 
 extend th ose limitations  and requirements so that they apply  to all R22, R44 and R66 
pilots regardless of their experience level s.  (007/17 ) 
Recommendation two  
7.11.  The consistently high er rate of mast -bumping accidents in New Zealand  compared with the rest 
of the world highlight s the increased risk of thi s type of accident occurring in New Zealand.  
7.12.  New Zealand's topography and prevailing wind conditions mean that for much of the country , 
and particularly the South Island, turbulent conditions can be encountere d most of the time.  
7.13.  Owing  to the  increased risk of mas t-bumping and  the high number of Robinson helicopters 
flying in New Zealand, the CAA should take more effective action to  reduc e the risk of these 
accidents occurring in New Zealand.  
7.14.  On 23 February  2017  the Commission:  
 gave notice to the Director of Civil Aviation that recommendation  007/17  had been mad e 
to the Administrator of the FAA , which recommended the FAA  extend the limitations and 
requirements of FAA AD 95 -26-04 to the R44 and R66, and to all Rob inson pilots 
regardless of their experience levels  
 recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that until such time as recommendation 
007/17 is actioned by the FAA , he extend the limitations and requirements of FAA AD 95-
26-04 to R44  and R66 helicopters in New Zealand, and  to all pilots of Robinson helicopters 
in New Zealand regardless of their experience . (008/17) 
On 10 March 2017, the Director of CAA replied:  
 

<< Page 37 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  The Director will consider whether the action sought by the Commission meets the 
legislative threshold that must be satisfied fo r the issue of an Airworthiness 
Directive.  In doing this he will take into consideration the fact there have been no 
'mast bump 'accidents in NZ during the past tw o years.  In addition, at the time of 
providing this response, the CAA has a team in the US wo rking with the FAA 
Rotorcraft Directorate and the Robinons Helicopter Company on possible 
amendments to the Limitations sections of the P ilot Operating Handbo oks of the 
Robinson series aircraft and improvements to safety awareness training.  It may 
be that this work will provide an out come that will meet the intent of the 
Commission 's recommendation.  
 
 
  

<< Page 38 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Pilots of two -bladed , semi -rigid rotor helicopters must be acutely aware of the risk s and effects 
of encountering moderate or greater turbulence in strong winds , especially  in the lee of high 
terrain.   
8.2. If moderate  or greater  turbulence is encountered while flying a two -blade d, semi-rigid rotor 
helicopter,  the pilot should consider landing and waiting for the conditions to improv e. 
8.3. Pilots of two -blade d, semi -rigid rotor helicopters should be aware of the  helicopters ' increased 
susceptibil ity to low -G conditions  when  lightly loaded , and the adverse effects that high power 
and a  high tail rotor  have on the rate of roll . 
8.4. Pilots of Ro binson helicopters should use the manufacturer's approved low -G recovery 
technique as soon as low -G conditions are felt.

 Final report AO -2014 -006  Appendix 3 : NTSB special investigation  
1.  In 1994, concerned by the number of unexplained R22 accidents that involved a mast -bump  or low 
main rotor RPM ('loss of main rotor control'), the NTSB commenced a special investigation to 
examine those accidents and the certification history and handling q ualities of the R22. The 
investigation was later expanded to include similar R44 accidents.  
2.  In response to the initial recommendations made by the NTSB during the investigation, the FAA 
issued airworthiness directives (ADs) that limited R22 and R44 op erations in high winds and 
turbulence. The final versions, AD 95 -26-04 for the R22 and AD 95 -26-05 for the R44, were issued 
in 1996. AD 95 -26-04 was later made permanent, but AD 95 -26-05 was rescinded in 2004 after a 
review of the R44 in -service experience73. 
3.  AD 95 -26-04 included, in part, the following information:  
 Until the FAA completes its research into the conditions and aircraft characteristics 
that lead to main rotor blade / fuselage contact accidents, and corrective type design 
changes and opera ting limitations are identified, Model R22 pilots are strongly urged 
to become familiar with the following information and comply with these 
recommended procedures.  
 Main Rotor Stall: … Any flight condition that creates excessive angle of attack on the 
main rotor blades can produce a stall. Low main rotor RPM, aggressive manoeuvring, 
high collective angle (… high density altitude, over -pitching … during climb, or high 
forward airspeed) … The effect of these conditions can be amplified in turbulence.  
 Mast B umping: Mast bumping may occur with a teetering rotor system when excessive 
main rotor flapping results from low 'G' … or abrupt control input … High forward 
airspeed, turbulence and excessive sideslip can accentuate the adverse effects of 
these control mo vements.  
 To avoid these conditions, pilots are strongly urged to follow these recommendations:  
o Maintain cruise airspeeds between 60 [knots] and less than 0.9 [of maximum 
permitted airspeed] …  
o Avoid large, rapid forward cyclic inputs in forward flight, a nd abrupt control 
inputs in turbulence.  
4.  The FAA also issued SFAR 73 in 1995 to mandate specified awareness and flight training for all 
pilots of R22 and R44 helicopters. SFAR 73 required that the special training be delivered by an 
authorised instructor and completed by every pilot before "manipulating the controls" of a 
Robinson helicopter. SFAR 73 also stipulated that an annual flight review be undertaken in the 
applicable helicopter type until a specified minimum experience was attained, aft er which biannual 
flight reviews, in the relevant type, were required74. SFAR 73 was made permanent in June 2009.  
5.  The NTSB special investigation report noted that the FAA had conducted three special certification 
reviews of the R22 between 1982 and 199 4. Each review had concluded that the R22 was safe 
"when flown within its operating limitations". However, the NTSB found no evidence that the FAA 
had acted on internal recommendations regarding the certification testing of light helicopters and 
their dyna mic stability during manoeuvres (NTSB, 1996, pp. 20,  21).  
6.  Robinson conducted flight tests of the R22 in 1982 to survey rotor teeter clearances and the 
response to flight control inputs, and concluded that the R22 main rotor system "would not stall, 
exceed its teeter clearance, or contact the tail boom when the aircraft is flown within its approved 
limitations" (NTSB, 1996, p. 23). Similar tests conducted with the R44 in 1995 concluded that "the 
R44 could safely perform any nominal flight activity witho ut main rotor divergence tendencies" 
(NTSB, 1996, p. 23). However, because "the tests were not (and could not safely be) conducted to 
determine the [R44's] response to large, abrupt cyclic inputs … the flight test did  not provide the 
                                                        
73 Robinson took other action s to improve the R22, including the installation of an electronic fuel contr ol governor (which 
helps to control main rotor speed), a more powerful engine, and an automatic carburettor heat control.  
74 On 11 June 2015 Robinson published a tutorial on SFAR 73 at www.gyronimosystems.com/SFAR.   

<< Page 44 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 data needed to determi ne the mechanism for the blade diverging into the body" (NTSB, 1996, p. 
23).  
7.  The obvious constraints on hazardous flight testing led to a mathematical simulation model of R22 
main rotor dynamics being developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology 's School of Aerospace 
Engineering (Schrage, 1995)75. The project ended due to a lack of funds before the model was fully 
validated or all of the areas of interest had been  researched (for example, divergent modes of the 
rotor that led to blade -fuselage strik es) (NTSB, 1996, p. 24). However, for those areas of the flight 
envelope76 that were validated, the model verified the theory that pushovers (which cause a low -G 
condition) could lead to a main rotor blade striking the fuselage.  
8.  The Georgia Institute o f Technology report stated that "within the scope of this investigation no 
[static droop] stop contact or rotor/tail boom strikes occurred in the normal operating range of the 
helicopter", but some of the scenarios did produce notional mast -bumps and hub c ontact with the 
droop stop (Schrage, 1995, p. 127).  
9.    The report concluded, in part (Schrage, 1995, p. 133):  
The results from the cases executed in this report fall into three basic categories: 
(i) cases where no excessive flapping was observed, (ii)  cases where larger than 
normal flapping behavior was observed, and the various limits of the blade and 
hub were exceeded, and (iii) cases where there was indication of a definite tail 
boom strike. The primary objective of many of the cases executed in thi s 
investigation was to find as many flight conditions as possible which fall in the 
last category. As one would expect these cases correspond to maneuvers with 
large pilot inputs, cases where rotor stall is a factor, severe gusts among others. 
Thus, some c ases have been identified, where the simulation model seems to 
indicate a potential failure mode. These are primarily related to rotor stall at 
lower rpm … In case of pushover scenarios, simulation results indicate a 
sensitivity to abrupt aft cyclic under conditions of deep rotor stall. Gust under 
moderate conditions, seems not to be a problem even at high gross weights.  
10.  The Georgia Institute of Technology report recommended further areas of study, but the FAA 
confirmed in 2013 that the intended resea rch had not been completed.  
11.  Studies by the NTSB and manufacturers have shown that a low -inertia main rotor blade can strike 
the fuselage in just a few revolutions. It would take less than half a second for an R 44 main rotor 
operating at the normal sp eed of 408 RPM.  
12.  The NTSB's special investigation "found no direct evidence of an unstable blade or rotor system 
design. The extensive operational history, the wreckage evidence, flight tests, and computer 
simulations indicate that a dynamically unsta ble main rotor system is unlikely" (NTSB, 1996, p. 
25). The NTSB recognised that many factors, including large, abrupt pilot control inputs, were 
possible explanations for the accidents.  
13.  The summary of the NTSB special investigation report stated, in  part (NTSB, 1996, p. 27):  
The Board is also concerned that in the future, other highly responsive 
helicopters are likely to be designed and built that may have characteristics 
similar to the R22. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that as a part of the 
certification process for highly responsive helicopters, the FAA should establish 
operational requirements, student pilot training requirements, and instructor pilot 
requirements, such as those imposed on the R22 and R44, to ensure that pilots 
at all l evels of qualification and skills can adequately operate the helicopter. The 
Safety Board concludes that although the response rate of the R22 to cyclic input 
is not unsafe so long as the special operating rules remain in place, there is a 
need for the FAA  to consider the responsiveness of helicopters (especially 
lightweight, high performance helicopters such as the R22) as part of the 
certification process to determine if special operating rules or guidance are 
necessary. Thus, the Safety Board believes th at the FAA should require helicopter

such as the R22.  
14.  The NTSB made the following recommendations to the FAA at the conclusion of its special 
investigation (NTSB, 1996, p. 31):  
Ensure that Special Federal Aviation Regulation 73, the Flight Standardization 
Board specificati ons, and the airworthiness directives applicable to the operation 
of the R22 and R44 are made permanent (A -96-9)  
Establish, for future certification of highly responsive helicopters, operational 
requirements, student pilot training requirements, and instr uctor pilot 
requirements, such as those imposed for the R22 and R44, necessary to ensure 
that pilots of all levels of qualification and skills can adequately operate the 
helicopter (A -96-10)  
Require helicopter manufacturers to provide data on the response  of helicopters 
to flight control inputs to be used as part of the certification process, and require 
operational limitations or other measures for those helicopters that are highly 
responsive (A -96-11)  
In conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Spa ce Administration  [NASA] , 
continue the development of the simulator model of lightweight helicopters, 
using flight tests and whirl tower tests as needed to validate the model, to create 
a national resource tool for the study of flight control systems and m ain rotor 
blade dynamics. If any unusual main rotor blade system characteristics are 
found, ensure that the information and data gathered are disseminated to the 
appropriate agencies and industry (A -96-12).  
15.   The status of recommendation A -96-9 was ch anged to 'Closed  - acceptable action' in December 
1996 after the FAA agreed to make the listed documents permanent.  
16.   The status of recommendation A -96-10 was also changed to 'Closed  - acceptable action' in 
December 1996 after the FAA committed to est ablishing a Flight Standardization Board for each 
newly certificated helicopter to determine the operational and pilot training requirements.  
17.   In response to recommendation A -96-11, the FAA twice amended Advisory Circular 27 -1, 
Certification of Norma l Category Rotorcraft. The changes added guidance to manufacturers on a 
means of compliance with regulation 14CFR27.661, which requires rotor -fuselage clearance "for 
any operating condition". In a letter to the NTSB seeking closure of the recommendation, t he FAA 
stated that the guidance material addressed large control inputs by pilots and low -G manoeuvres. 
As a result, on 17 March 2000 the NTSB changed the recommendation status to 'Closed  - 
acceptable action'.  
18.  Recommendation A -96-12 was closed by the  NTSB in 1998 after it received a submission from the 
FAA, which read in part77: 
The FAA has reviewed the merits of developing a simulation tool for aiding the 
certification of future helicopter flight control systems/blade dynamics and has 
determined that such a tool would have limited application. This determination 
considered the actions that have already been accomplished and the status of 
the NASA initiative. The behavior of certain rotor system configurations may 
become unpredictable and dangerous beyo nd certain boundaries. For this 
reason, the FAA established a certified operating envelope. Due to the 
combination of extremely complex flight control inputs, non -linear environmental 
gust effects and the inherent difficulties in various rotor blade airfoi l/hub 
designs, development of a single generic mathematical model to predict 
acceptable flight limitations would have limited application. Subsequent

FATAL ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY LOW RPM ROTOR STALL  
A primary cause of fatal accidents in light helicopters is failure to  
maintain rotor RPM. To avoid this, every pilot must have his reflexes  
conditioned so he will instantly add throttle and lower collective to  
maintain RPM in any emergency.  
The R22 and R44 have demonstrated excellent crashworthiness as long  
as the pilot flies the aircraft all the way to the ground and executes a  
flare at the bottom to reduce his airspeed and rate of descend. Even  
when going down into rough terr ain, trees, wires or water, he must  
force himself to lower the collective to maintain RPM until just before  
impact. The ship may roll over and be severly damaged, but the  
occupants have an excellent chance of walking away from it without  
injury.  
Power avai lable from the engine is directly proportional to RPM. If the  
RPM drops 10%, there is 10% less power. With less power, the  
helicopter will start to settle, and if the collective is raised to stop it from  
settling, the RPM will be pulled down even lower, ca using the ship to  
settle even faster. If the pilot not only fails to lower collective, but  
instead pulls up on the collective to keep the ship from going down, the  
rotor will stall almost immediately. When it stalls, the blades will either  
"blow back" and cut off the tail cone or it will just stop flying, allowing  
the helicopter to fall at an extreme rate. In either case, the resulting  
crash is likely to be fatal.  
No matter what causes the low rotor RPM, the pilot must first roll on  
throttle and lower the collective simultaneously to recover RPM before  
investigating the problem. It must be a conditioned reflex. In forward  
flight, applying aft cyclic to bleed off airspeed will also help recover lost  
RPM.

AIRPLANE PILOTS HIGH RISK WHEN FLYING HELICOPTERS  
There have been a number of fatal accidents involving experienced pilots  
who have many hours in airplanes but with only limited experience flying  
helicopters.  
The ingrained reactions of an experienced airplane pilot can be deadly  
when flying a helicopter. The airplane pilot may fly the helicopter well  
when doing normal maneuvers under ordinary conditions when there is  
time to think about the proper control response.  But when required to  
react suddenly under unexpected circumstances, he may revert to his  
airplane reactions and commit a fatal error. Under those conditions, his  
hands and feet move purely by reaction without conscious thought.  
Those reactions may well be  based on his greater experience, ie., the  
reactions developed flying airplanes.  
For example, in an airplane his reaction to a warning horn (stall) would  
be to immediately go forward with the stick and add power. In a  
helicopter, application of forward sti ck when the pilot hears a horn (low  
RPM) would drive the RPM even lower and could result in rotor stall,  
especially if he also "adds power" (up collective). In less than one  
second the pilot could stall his rotor, causing the helicopter to fall out of  
the sky. 
Another example is the reaction necessary to make the aircraft go down.  
If the helicopter pilot must suddenly descend to avoid a bird or another  
aircraft, he rapidly lowers the collective with very little movement of  
the cyclic stick. In the same situation, the airplane pilot would push the  
stick forward to dive. A rapid forward movement of the helicopter cyclic  
stick under these conditions would result in a low "G" condition which  
could cause mast bumping, resulting in separation of the rotor shaf t or 
one blade striking the fuselage. A similar situation exists when  
terminating a climb after a pull -up. The airplane pilot does it with  
forward stick. The helicopter pilot must use his collective or a very  
gradual, gentle application of forward cyclic.  
To stay alive in the helicopter, the experienced airplane pilot must  
devote considerable time and effort to developing safe helicopter  
reactions. The helicopter reactions must be stronger and take  
precedence over the pilot's airplane reactions because ever ything  
happens faster in a helicopter. The pilot does not have time to realize  
he made the wrong move, think about it, and then correct it. It's too  
late; the rotor has already stalled or a blade has already struck the  
airframe and there is no chance of re covery. To develop safe helicopter  
reactions, the airplane pilot must practice each procedure over and over  
again with a competent instructor until his hands and feet will always  
make the right move without requiring conscious thought. AND, ABOVE  
ALL, HE M UST NEVER ABRUPTLY PUSH THE CYCLIC STICK  
FORWARD.

The higher this line is,  
especially with power, 
the faster the roll rate.  
The helicopter encounters  
a low -G condition while 
in a normal nose -down  
(tail -high) cruise. The 
faster the speed, the 
higher the tail will be.  
The tail rotor thrust (blue  
line) is well above the  
centre of gravity (red line). 
This produces a large 
rolling moment on the 
fuselage to the right.  
The rotor disc does  
not follow the fuselage, 
as it is unloaded.  
A mast -bump occurs  
when the teeter limit is

Robinson helicopters: mast bumping accidents in NZ  
What is the problem?  
The T ransport Accident Investigation Commission is concerned about the number of accidents in New 
Zealand in which Robinson helicopters have experienced 'mast bumping'. These accidents have raised 
concerns about the risks of flying these helicopters in the moun tainous terrain and weather conditions 
that are common in New Zealand.  
Mast bumping is contact between an inner part of a main rotor blade or a rotor hub and the main rotor 
drive shaft (or 'mast). Mast bumping usually results in the helicopter breaking up  in flight, which is fatal 
for those on board.  
Part of the problem is that the available evidence has not allowed the circumstances and causes of all 
of these 'mast bumping' accidents to be fully determined. However, a significant proportion have been 
found to have occurred in "low -G"80 flight conditions. Helicopters with semi -rigid two -bladed main  
rotor systems, as used on Robinson helicopters, are particularly susceptible to mast bumping in "low -G" 
conditions. Low -G can be caused by large or abrupt fligh t control inputs or by turbulence. The risk of 
mast bumping in turbulence increases with high power settings and operating at high speed and light 
weight.  
What is the solution?  
Operators must select a type of aircraft suited to the risk profile of the int ended use. Similarly, all pilots 
must understand the helicopter's operating limitations, avoid circumstances which could see these 
inadvertently exceeded, and receive proper training in the causes, dangers, and prevention of mast 
bumping, including in low -G conditions. It is particularly important for Robinson pilots to be aware of the 
risks of flying a lightly loaded helicopter at high speed in turbulence. Prohibitions against in -flight low -G 
demonstrations must be observed, and low -G recovery training mus t be conducted on the ground.  
The regulatory environment must:  
 support high quality training and improved pilot awareness of mast bumping risks, including in 
low-G conditions  
 require the manufacturer to clearly state the limitations of the helicopters  
 encourage use of the helicopter as appropriate to the operating conditions.  
 
Further research should be undertaken into the factors that can lead to mast bumping.  
A requirement for cockpit video recorders and/or other means of data capture would provide useful 
data to investigations.  
Background  
Robinson helicopters are relatively inexpensive to purchase and cost effective to operate; and are 
therefore popular. About 300 are registered in New Zealand, mostly R22 and R44 models, with a small 
number of turbi ne-powered, 5 -seat R66 models. These are used for flight training, agricultural, tourism, 
                                                        
80 A low -G condition occurs when an object is subjected to a net vertical force less than the force of gravity. When  
the vertical force is zero, the object is described as being 'weightless'.  
 
 

<< Page 71 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006  and commercial operations. All Robinson helicopter pilot operating handbooks state that pilots should 
avoid flying in high winds or turbulence, and subjecting the hel icopter to low -G conditions.  
Since 1996 the Commission or the Civil Aviation Auth ority (CAA) have investigated fourteen  mast 
bumping accidents or incidents involving Robinson helicopters, including nine where low -G mast 
bumping is known to have occurred. Six of th ese were in the past four years . Eighteen people have died 
in all these accidents, including nine in known low -G mast bumping accidents. The low -G related rate in 
New Zealand is considerably higher than in other parts of the world81. The Commission 's inquiries have 
issued safety recommendations that remain open.  
Mast bumping is contact between an inner part of a main rotor blade or a rotor hub and the main rotor 
drive shaft. Helicopters with the semi -rigid two -bladed rotor systems used on Robinson helicopters are 
susceptible to mast bumping during low -G flight conditions. Mast bumping usually results in the 
helicopter breaking up during flight, which is fatal for those on board. For this reason, it is often difficult 
to determine exactly what happen ed to cause the mast bump.  
Low-G conditions can arise in turbulence. Significant areas of New Zealand terrain are mountainous, 
and they are often exposed to strong wind. Therefore, New Zealand pilots are more likely to encounter 
turbulence than in some ot her parts of the world where Robinson helicopters are used. Pilots must be 
aware of how hazardous it can be to operate Robinson helicopters in moderate or greater turbulence.  
Instructors and pilots must be clear in their understanding of the hazards of op erating semi -rigid two -
bladed helicopters in low -G conditions, and how inadvertent or improper flight control inputs can cause 
mast bumping. Low -G recovery training must be conducted as ground training only.  
The Commission also identified that the rate of  Robinson helicopter in -flight break -up accidents in New 
Zealand had not been significantly reduced by New Zealand's adoption of the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) measures intended to help prevent such accidents. We also found the format of 
the Rob inson helicopter flight manuals and their terminology did not draw enough attention to safety 
critical instructions and conditions that could result in serious injury or death.  
We recommended that the CAA:  
 conduct a review of Robinson safety awareness tr aining in New Zealand and facilitate the 
development and adoption of best practice across the sector, including a level of consistency in 
the way instructors deliver the safety awareness training.  
 review FAA SFAR 73 [Special Federal Aviation Regulation 73 , which mandated special safety 
awareness training for all R22 and R44 pilots and set a threshold for minimum pilot experience] 
in the context of the New Zealand aviation system and adopt relevant improvements that would 
likely enhance the operational safe ty of Robinson helicopters in New Zealand.  
 include the knowledge and training requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73, 
or an equivalent requirement, as a prerequisite for the issue of a Robinson R66 type rating.  
 promptly publicise the recent changes to the Robinson R66 (and R44) Pilot's Operating 
Handbooks that caution against flight in high winds and turbulence, and which advise pilots to 
reduce power and speed if turbulence is expected or encountered.  
In response, the CAA reviewed Ro binson safety awareness training in New Zealand, and it has since 
clarified training requirements for pilots of the R22 and R44 helicopters. The CAA decided not to include 
the R66 in the safety awareness training, saying that the FAA had rejected the inclu sion of the R66 in 
SFAR 73, and that it would monitor advice from Robinson Helicopters and the FAA82.  
                                                        
81 For instance, the low -G mast bumping accident rate in New Zealand compared with the United States is about nine 
times higher. This is based on fleet size of about 300 compared to 2700, and the same number of low -G mast bumping 
accidents in each market since the year 2000 (data provided by Rob inson Helicopters). Variations in types of use or 
average hours flown may explain some of this difference.  
82 The CAA and the FAA signed a Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) in 2002, which included enhanced 
cooperation and efficiency, and reciprocal  acceptance of airworthiness approvals.   

<< Page 72 >>
 Final report AO -2014 -006 In May 2016, the Commission released its report into a mast bump and the in -flight break up of a 
Robinson R66 helicopter in the Kaweka Range in 201383. One of the recommendations from the inquiry 
into that accident was that the FAA reinstate research into the dynamic behaviour of the Robinson's 
rotor system under conditions of low -G.  
The FAA and Robinson had conducted post -certification flight testing in 1982 (for the R22), 1995 (for 
the R44), and 2014 (for the R66), which included limited low -G manoeuvres. Due to the dangers of low -
G, it is not possible to investigate more severe conditions with test pilot flying. However, computational 
sciences and ae rospace engineering have advanced to such a degree that a fuller understanding of the 
dynamic behaviour of the Robinson and other semi -rigid two -bladed rotor systems should now be 
possible.  
Following an R44 accident84, the Commission has further recommende d that the CAA and Secretary of 
Transport promote, through the International Civil Aviation Organization, the need for cockpit video 
recorders and/or other means of data capture in certain classes of helicopter. This action could help 
better determine why these accidents happen. The CAA has accepted this recommendation and agreed 
to initiate an assessment paper on the issue.  
The Commission's recommendations are seeking concerted actions by regulatory authorities, the 
manufacturer, operators, instructors an d pilots to promote the safe operation of Robinson helicopters in 
the New Zealand environment; and to better understand the helicopter's operating characteristics and 
the factors that can lead to mast bumping.
