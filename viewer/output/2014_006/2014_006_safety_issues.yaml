- safety_issue: 'A mast-bump occurred, which led to rotor divergence and the in-flight break-up.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'The in-flight break-up was very unlikely to have been caused by low main rotor RPM (revolutions per minute).

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'An abrupt, inappropriate or inadvertent cyclic control input by the pilot could not be ruled out as having contributed to the in-flight break-up.

- safety_issue: 'The actual wind and turbulence at the time of the accident were very likely to have been the same as, or stronger than, the forecast conditions.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'The helicopter very likely encountered moderate to severe turbulence and an associated severe downdraught in the lee of Mt Arthur, which likely created a prolonged low-G condition.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'Had a previous limitation on maximum wind speeds for inexperienced R44 pilots remained in place, as per that for R22 pilots, the pilot would have been prohibited from flying at the time of the accident due to the forecast strong winds and turbulence.

- safety_issue: 'All three Robinson helicopter models are susceptible to low-G mast-bumping, and any preventive measures should apply to all of them.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'Due to their unique main rotor design, during a sudden and prolonged low-G condition Robinson helicopters can roll rapidly to the right and likely break up before a pilot can recover.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'A pilot''s instinctive reaction to an unexpected right roll, or the unintentional movement of a pilot''s limbs or upper body during severe turbulence or low-G, could lead to mast-bumping.

    '
  quality: exact
- safety_issue: 'Although not an intuitive reaction to a sudden right roll, the aft cyclic technique is the only approved recovery technique, and should be used as soon as low-G is felt to ''reload'' the main rotor disc and help reduce any right roll.
