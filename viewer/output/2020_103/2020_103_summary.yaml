- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 40
  explanation: 'The driver''s familiarity with the crossing and the low frequency of trains likely led to the assumption that no train would be present, contributing to the accident: "drivers who are familiar with a railway crossing are more likely to be involved in a crossing incident than drivers unfamiliar with the crossing" (3.9 (invalid formatted quote)). The driver''s habitual behavior and lack of expectation of encountering a train also played a role: "the driver did not expect to encounter a train on the crossing" and "it is also unlikely that they had previously encountered a train on the crossing" (3.28 (invalid formatted quote)).'
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 30
  explanation: 'The driver''s attention was likely focused on the road traffic ahead rather than the level crossing warning devices, leading to a lack of situational awareness: "an attentional focus on oncoming road traffic may have contributed to the driver not seeing or registering level crossing warning devices on clevely line" (3.21 (invalid formatted quote)). Additionally, the driver''s situational expectation and established habits may have interfered with their ability to detect and perceive the threat of the train (3.17).'
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: 'The driver''s behavior at the level crossing likely followed a habitual pattern without the practice of stopping, which if done, could have reduced the risk of collision: "had the driver been in the habit of stopping at the crossing, it is likely that the risk of a collision with a train would have been reduced" (3.30 (invalid formatted quote)).'
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 10
  explanation: 'Amendments to road legislation in 2009 removed the requirement for passenger service vehicles to stop at level crossings with active protection, which may have contributed to the accident: "road legislation was amended in 2009 to remove the requirement for passenger service vehicles to stop before traversing a level crossing where active protection was present" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote)). The amendments did not consider the risks to road and rail users at level crossings near road intersections, potentially increasing risks (3.38-3.39).'
