- name: Habituation to Routine
  explanation: Habituation to routine is a safety theme where the repetition of a task leads to a reduction in conscious attention to the task, potentially resulting in a lack of preparedness for unexpected events. This theme is relevant to the accident because the driver had been employed by Uzabus for five years and had been on the same daily route since 9 days prior to the accident, crossing the level crossing 10 times per day. This repetition likely led to habit formation, where "neural activity is limited to the start and finish of the task, with relatively little activity during the task itself" (3.3.6 (invalid formatted quote)). The driver's behavior at the level crossing would likely have followed a habitual pattern, and it is likely that the driver did not expect to encounter a train on the crossing and had not previously encountered a train there (3.3.7).
- name: Driver Expectation and Attention
  explanation: Driver expectation and attention is a safety theme that involves how a driver's expectations and where they focus their attention can influence their ability to detect and respond to hazards. In this accident, the driver's attention was likely on the road ahead, judging a gap in the traffic to turn through, rather than on looking to see if the lights were flashing at the level crossing (3.3.8). The driver's expectation, based on their routine, would not have included encountering a train, which likely contributed to the driver not registering the level crossing warning devices in time to react and stop the bus before the level crossing (4.2).
- name: Effectiveness of Level Crossing Warnings
  explanation: The effectiveness of level crossing warnings is a safety theme that examines how well warning devices capture the attention of drivers and prompt the appropriate response. In this case, the level crossing protections were found to be in accordance with the relevant manual and operating correctly immediately prior to the accident (3.1.4). However, the driver may not have seen or registered the level crossing warning devices due to their attentional focus on oncoming road traffic (3.3.8). This suggests that while the warning devices were functioning, they may not have been effective in capturing the driver's attention in this particular context.
- name: Regulatory Changes and Compliance
  explanation: Regulatory changes and compliance is a safety theme that looks at how changes in laws and rules can influence the behavior of individuals and the safety of operations. The report mentions that prior to 2009, passenger service vehicles were required to stop before all level crossings unless exempt signs or barrier arms were installed. However, amendments made to the Land Transport (Road User) Rule 2004 removed the requirement for a passenger service vehicle to stop at a level crossing if active protection like flashing signals was installed (3.4.1). This change in regulation may have influenced the driver's behavior by removing the habit of stopping at the crossing, which could have reduced the risk of collision (3.4.14).
- name: Interaction with Road Intersections
  explanation: Interaction with road intersections is a safety theme that considers the additional risks posed by level crossings that are in close proximity to road intersections. The report indicates that the amendments to the Rule did not consider the risks to road and rail users at level crossings near road intersections (3.4.17). The accident occurred as the driver was likely focused on maneuvering the bus through a right-hand turn and did not register the active warning devices in time (4.2). The proximity of the level crossing to the intersection may have contributed to the driver's divided attention and the subsequent accident.
- name: Human Factors in Unexpected Events
  explanation: 'Human factors in unexpected events is a safety theme that involves how drivers process and respond to unexpected situations. The report discusses two information-processing modes activated when a driver is faced with an unexpected event: automatic and attentive (3.3.5). In this accident, observing the flashing lights was an unexpected event for the driver, leading to an attentive response that is usually slower and has a greater likelihood of error (3.3.8). The driver''s likely attentive response to the flashing lights, as opposed to an automatic response, may have delayed their reaction time, contributing to the accident (3.3.13).'
