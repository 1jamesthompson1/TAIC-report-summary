  \ the circumstances surrounding the event to identify \nthose factors that increased\
  \ the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the \nseverity of its outcome.\
  \ It also examines any safety issues that have the potential to \nadversely affect\
  \ future operations.  \n The reason for the driver not stopping before the level\
  \ crossing could not be \ndetermined with certainty. The following analysis provides\
  \ expert opinion on the \nhuman factors that likely  contributed to the driver's\
  \ actions.  \n The Commission engaged an organisationa l psychologist1 to assist\
  \  the Commission in \ngaining  a better understanding of the potential human factors\
  \  involved in the accident . \nThe analysis of the driver's behaviour is summarised\
  \ in paragraphs 3. 9 to 3.2 8. \n The Commission found that the Clevely Line level\
  \ crossing protections were in \naccordance with Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency's\
  \ Traffic  Control Devices Manual,  \nPart 9 - Level Crossings, and  that witness\
  \ accounts indicate d that the warning devices \nwere oper ating correctly immediately\
  \ prior to the accident.   \n The Commission found no evidence that other factors,\
  \ such as sunstrike or the driver \nbeing distracted by passengers on the bus, contributed\
  \ to the accident.  \nFactors likely influencing the bus driver's behaviour  \n\
  \ The driver had been employed by Uzabus for five years, and by a nother bus operator\
  \ \nfor seven years prior to that . Their usual route was the Palmerston North to\
  \ Feilding \ntrip. \n The Commission obtained the driver's roster from Uzabus .\
  \ It identified that the driver \nhad been on the same daily route since 7 September,\
  \ nine days prior to the accident, \nand had been regularly rostered on the route\
  \ for at least the previous six months.  \nDuring a normal day the driver crossed\
  \ over the crossing  10 times , compl eting five \nreturn trips  per day . This\
  \ amounted to 50 times over the crossing per normal working \nweek . \n The Australian\
  \ Transport Safety Bureau  released a report on 29 July 2016 - RO-2015 -\n016: Collision\
  \ involving a road -train truck and train 8834N  - that had similarities to the\
  \ \nClevely Line collision. The report stated in part:  \nStudies undertaken into\
  \ motorist behaviour have found that drivers who are familiar with a \nrailway crossing\
  \ are more likely to be involved in a crossing incident than drivers  unfami liar\
  \ \nwith the crossing .2 Where train frequency is relatively low (trains rarely\
  \ seen), motorists \nfamiliar with the crossing  are even less likely to expect\
  \ a train.   \n The physical defence s in place to mitigate the risk of collision\
  \ at the crossing included \nwarning signs and alternately f lashing red lights\
  \ and bells  (see Figures 3 and 4 ). \n \n1 Organi sational psychology is a branch\

  \ Commission)  \n The defences in place at the crossing were reliant on a driver\
  \ observing a threat  and, \nthrough a series of processes,  reacting appropriately\
  \ to it.  \nlevel crossing warning devices - flashing \nlights and bells angled\
  \ towards approach \nfrom Railway Road  level crossing warning signage  \n \nroad\
  \ vehicle limit line  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -103 \n<< Page 7 >>\n \n These\
  \ processes include but  are not limited to: situational expectation  (what always\
  \  \nhappens ?), established habits  (what I always  do), threat detection  (what\
  \ is that?) , threat \nperception  (is that a problem?) , analysis of options  (what\
  \ should I do?) , decision -\nmaking  (I will do this) , and control responses \
  \ (taking action) .3 4 \n All such processes are subject to neurological and physical\
  \ limitations  depend ent on \nfactors such as age, fitness  and health . \n Researchers\
  \ have identified that w hen a driver is faced with an unexpected event , two \n\
  information -processing modes  are activated : automatic  and attentiv e.5  \n An\
  \ immediate threat , such as a car ahead suddenly braking , generates an automatic\
  \ \nreaction , one that happens quickly and without conscious thought.  \n Alternatively,\
  \ observing a pers on standing on the side of the road gesturing to slow \ndown\
  \ requires thought (an attentive response ) as the driver tries to evaluate the\
  \ \nsituation and work out what to do.  \n The attentive response is usually slower\
  \ and has a greater likelihood of error  than the \nautomatic response . As the\
  \ bus  approached the Clevely Line along Railway Road, an \nattentional focus on\
  \ oncoming road traffic  may have contributed to the driver not \nseeing or registering\
  \  level crossing warning devices  on Clevely Line.   \n It is likely  that the\
  \ driver's  attention was on the road ahead  (Railway Road), judging a \ngap in\
  \ the traffic to turn in  through , rather than on looking to see if the lights\
  \ were \nflashing . \n The Palmerston North to Feilding bus service had been  a\
  \ daily routi ne for the driver for \nseveral years. Through this repetition it\
  \ is likely  that sections of the route ha d become \nhabit s. \n Habit formation\
  \ is a complex neural process that allows the brain to conserve energy. \nWhen learning\
  \ a new task there is a high level of neural activity. Once the task has \nbecome\
  \ a habit, neural activity is limited to the start and finish of the task, with\
  \ \nrelatively  little activity during the task itself. Drivers who follow  the\
  \ same route from \nhome to work and back every day often report doing so 'on autopilot\
  \ ' as they think \nabout other topics. However, when a habit is disrupted, for\
  \ example by roadworks that \nblock a normal route, there is an increase in neural\
  \ activity as t he driver assesses the \nsituation and identifies an alternative\
  \ course of action . Both processes  take extra time .6 \n The driver's  behaviour\
  \ at the level crossing would likely  have followed a habitual \npattern. Based\
  \ on the bus and train schedules, it is likely  that the driver did not expect \n\
  to encounter a train on the crossing . It is also unlikely  that they had previously\
  \ \nencountered a train on the crossing.  \n \n3 Rudin -Brown, C. M., French -St.\

  Final Report RO -2020 -103 \n<< Page 8 >>\n \n On ascertaining that it was safe\
  \ to turn , the driver would likely  have concentrated on \ncompleting the manoeuvre\
  \ to cross the tracks. Had they had past experience of \nrandomly encountering a\
  \ train at that crossing , they would likely  have b een actively \nmonitoring to\
  \ see if the lights were active and would have b een prepared to stop.  \n It is\
  \ likely  that the driver first became aware of the flashing lights as they were\
  \ \ncompleting the turn.  \n As observing  the flashing lights was an unexpected\
  \ event , there was likely  a brief \nperiod in which the driver attempted to process\
  \ the information and evaluate the \nsituation.  \n If the driver realised the lights\
  \ were flashing , a natural instinct  would have been to look \nto see how far away\
  \ the train was and the direction from which it was coming.  \n Rather than being\
  \ an automatic response, e.g. immediately activating the brake, the \ndriver's \
  \ response would have been attentive as they evaluated the thr eat. \n Based on\
  \ the speed of the approaching locomotive, witness reports of the bus speed , \n\
  and the average  normal reaction time7, the driver would have been  unlikely  to\
  \ have  \nhad sufficient time to both evaluate the situation and bring the bus to\
  \ a safe stop \nbefore the level crossing, had they in fact seen the warning devices.\
  \  \n Consequently,  the bus entered the level crossing as the locomotive was passing\
  \ over it , \nresulting in the bus colliding with the rear of the locomotive.  \n\
  \ Had the driver been in the habit of stopping at the crossing , it is likely  that\
  \ the risk of a \ncollision with a train would have been reduced.  \nPassenger service\
  \ vehicles are not required to stop at level crossi ngs \nfitted with active protection\
  \  \nSafety issue : There was no evidence that t he rail industry had been  consulted\
  \ on legislat ive \nchanges affecting the safety of the rail corridor .  \n Prior\
  \ to 2009 , school buses and vehicles being used for the carriage of passengers\
  \  \n(passenger service vehicles)  were  required to stop before all level crossings\
  \ unless \n'exempt ' sign s or barrier arms were installed . \n In 2009 a series\
  \ of amendments was made to the Land Transport  (Road User) Rule \n2004 (the Rule)\
  \ , which  included  an exemption from  the requirement to stop if \"a traffic \n\
  signal producing a steady red signal in the form of a disc or 2 alternately flashing\
  \ red \nsignals is installed at the level crossing\".  \n This amendment effectively\
  \  removed the requirement for a passenger service vehicle \nto stop at a level\
  \ crossing unless the crossing was protected by a compulsory stop sign \nor the\
  \ level crossing protection was activated .  \n Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency\
  \ was asked to provide details of the reasoni ng and \nincentive for amending the\
  \ Rule. It replied in part:  \nBefore 2009, incidents were regularly reported of\
  \ motorists taking unsafe, evasive action to \navoid a bus that had stopped, or\
  \ was about to stop, in compliance with existing \n \n7 Research varies on an average\
  \  normal reaction time. Studies range from 0.7 seconds to 3 seconds . Based on\
  \ \nage, i t is likely the driver was at the higher end of the normal reaction time.\
  \  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -103 \n<< Page 9 >>\n requirements. As a resu lt,\
  \ many bus drivers were reluctant to stop in advance of level \ncrossings, particularly\
  \ those crossings equipped with flashing signals. The level of \ncompliance, particularly\
  \ in open -road areas, was reported as poor.  \n Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency\
  \ was also asked for evidence of any risk assessment \nor analysis under taken prior\
  \ to the amendment . It replied in part:  \n\u2026 For the remaining sections, the\
  \ benefit to society was improved road safety and traffic \nflow efficiency, and\
  \ the benefit to industry was improved safety and efficiency of services \ndue to\
  \ the relaxing of regulation . \n Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency also provided\
  \ documentation pertaining to the \ndecision -making  process used by the drafters\
  \ of the amendments.  It stated in part:  \nThis requirement [stopping at level\
  \ crossings] also delays the flow of traffic. This \nrequirement, specifically for\
  \ heav y passenger service vehicles, was imposed prior to 1950. \nThe perceived\
  \ risk of multiple fatalities/injuries from a collision between a bus and a train\
  \ \nwas considered sufficient to require bus drivers to stop and ensure the way\
  \ is clear before \nproceeding across the railway track. At that time there was\
  \ also a speed limit of 15 mph \n[15 miles per hour , or 24 kilometres per hour\
  \ ] across the tracks for all other  vehicles so the \npotential conflict between\
  \ them and a stopped vehicle was not as great.   \nThe documentation provided by\
  \ Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency did not detail how \nthe perceived risk of multiple\
  \ fatalities/injuries from a collision between a bus and a \ntrain had changed between\
  \ 1950 and 2009  when the Rule was amended.  Nor did it \ndetail what , if any,\
  \  consideration was given to the danger to rail traffic of a collis ion \nwith\
  \ a heavy passenger service vehicle.  \n Neither KiwiRail nor Waka Kotahi NZ Transport\
  \ Agency could find records of \nconsultation on this matter. The Commission was\
  \ unable to establish if any such \nconsultation between Waka Kotahi NZ Transport\
  \ Agency and the rail industry had \ntaken place.  \n \nSafety issue: The amendments\
  \ to the Rule did not consider  the risk s to road and rail users  at \nlevel crossings\
  \ in close proximity to road intersections . \n In 1993 t he Commission investigated\
  \ two accidents similar  to the Clevely Line collision : \nsee report s RO-1993\
  \ -105: Collision with motor vehicle near Levin and RO-1993 -112: \nPassenger train\
  \ collision with a concrete mixer truck near Rolleston , in which  a total of \n\
  three people were killed and seven seriously injured . \n Both of these accidents\
  \ involved level crossings in close proximity to road \nintersections.  \n Several\
  \ recommendations were made to address the safety issues identified in RO -\n1993\
  \ -105; of most re levance is recommendation 056/93 :  \nThat Transit New Zealand\
  \ develop a code of practice for the design of intersections with \nclosely adjacent\
  \ railway crossings, taking into account the combined risk of accident that \nthe\
  \ two hazards present  \nAlso recommendat ion 057/93:  \nThat a programme be developed\
  \ to review the adequacy of all warnings to motorists at \nintersections on State\
  \ Highways which have railway crossings in close proximity.  \n \n \nFinal Report\
  \ RO -2020 -103 \n<< Page 10 >>\n \n These recommendations formed the basis for\
  \ safety improvements later made to the \nwarning signage and road markings for\
  \ motorists approa ching  level crossings within \nNew Zealand.  \n The safety improvements\
  \ were implemented  and a code of practice was developed. \nThe Commission was satisfied\
  \ with the actio ns taken  and b oth recommendations were \nclosed in 2003 .  \n\
  \ On 1 November 2009, the Rule was amended with the addition of clauses 9.5(b) and\
  \ \n9.5(c).  These clause s provided an exemption  for large passenger servi ce\
  \ vehicles having \nto stop at level crossings fitted with  barriers or  alternately\
  \  flashing red lights (active \nprotection).  \n The amendments to the Rule appear\
  \ to have been developed with a singular focus on \nroad safety , as they  did not\
  \ consider the effect s that the amendment to exempt \npassenge r service vehicles\
  \ stopping at level crossings would have on the safety of rail \ncorridor users\
  \ , or consider  previous recommendations made by the Commission.  \n The removal\
  \ of the requirement for passenger service vehicles to stop before level  \ncrossings\
  \ fitted  with active protection  was intended to lower the risk to road users .\
  \ Not \nconsidering  the added dangers posed by level crossing s in close proximity\
  \ to \nintersections  could have  increased the risk s to both road and rail users\
  \ . \n The Commission has made a recommendation to address this safety issue in\
  \ Section 6.  \n \n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -103 \n<< Page 11 >>"
