Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Poor standard of watchkeeping: Both vessels had poor watchkeeping practices, failing to properly assess the risk of collision and take necessary action to avoid each other. The crew on the Kota Lembah did not take appropriate action as required by the COLREGS, while the crew on the F.V. Commission did not maintain a proper lookout or establish the risk of collision.

2. Fatigue: Fatigue was identified as a factor contributing to the collision. The skipper of the F.V. Commission had been awake for approximately 20 hours and was experiencing a natural dip in alertness level. The skipper's decision-making may have been influenced by fatigue. Additionally, there were indications that fatigue management on board the F.V. Commission was inadequate, with insufficient resources provided to achieve proper rest hours.

3. Inadequate training and resourcing: The deckhands on the F.V. Commission were not sufficiently trained in watchkeeping, and the vessel's MTOP did not address the issue of fatigue adequately. There is evidence that some owners of smaller fishing vessels do not fully adhere to the requirement for deckhands to be trained in watchkeeping. Insufficient crew and training levels compromise compliance with regulations and increase the risk of collisions or groundings.
