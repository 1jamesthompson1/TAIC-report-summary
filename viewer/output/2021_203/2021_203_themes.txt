Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Poor standard of watchkeeping: Both vessels had poor watchkeeping practices, failing to properly assess the risk of collision and take necessary action to avoid each other. Assumptions were made about right of way and size-based expectations, leading to a lack of appropriate action.

2. Fatigue: Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor to the collision. The skipper of the F.V. Commission had been awake for approximately 20 hours and was experiencing a natural dip in alertness. Insufficient rest hours and non-compliant practices of sleeping while drifting and assuming other vessels would keep out of the way contributed to the fatigue.

3. Inadequate training and resourcing: The deckhands on the F.V. Commission were not sufficiently trained in watchkeeping, and the vessel lacked adequate crew members to manage the risk of fatigue and maintain proper watchkeeping. This issue is not uncommon in the smaller fishing fleet, indicating a broader problem in the industry.
