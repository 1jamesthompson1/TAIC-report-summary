The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may mak e recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 22 October 2011 a Britten -Norman BN.2A Mk.III -2 "Trislander " (the aeroplane) was 
scheduled for a scenic charter flight from Pauanui Beach aerodrome.  The aeroplane was 
operated by Great Barrier Air lines Limited  (the airline , or the operator ).  On board were 13 
people  - the pilot, another company employee and 11 passengers.  
1.2. The pilot applied full power for the take -off but was unable to get the aeroplane airborne, so 
she abandoned  the take -off and applied full braking.  The aeroplane did not stop before the 
end of the runway and went through a low wooden rail marking the end of the runway, 
stopping with its nose  wheel in a garden just 3 metres  (m) short of a public footpath.  Nobod y 
was injured and damage to the aeroplane was minor.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the main reason 
for the aeroplane not getting airborne was that its centre of gravity (balance) was significantly 
outside the permi ssible limits.  The pilot's take -off technique and, possibly, increased 
resistance from the wheels of the heavy aeroplane on the runway surface were other factors 
that contributed to the aeroplane over -running the end of the runway . 
1.4. The Commission also fou nd that the required margin for a safe take -off was not met because 
the aeroplane was too heavy for the available runway length.  This was a reason for the 
aeroplane not stopping before the runway end after the pilot had rejected the take -off. 
1.5. The Commissi on identified the following safety  issues : 
 the standard of pilot training and supervision of operations at Great Barrier Airlines was 
below that required  
 the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) had had recurring concerns for the 
management and st andard of operations at Great Barrier Airlines during the 3 years prior 
to this incident, but the actions taken to address those concerns had been largely 
ineffective  
 the Thames -Coromandel District Council (the council) had not evaluated the effect s of a 
subsurface  runway irrigation system on the maximum equivalent single wheel  load 
(ESWL) for the Pauanui Beach runway.  
1.6. The Commission has made recommendations  to the Director of Civil Aviation (the Director) 
and the Chief Executive of the council to address these safety issues.  
1.7. Key lessons  identified during this inquiry were:  
 pilots must know the weight and balance of their aircraft before every flight and ensure 
that both remain within permissible limits.  Failure to do so can have serious 
consequences for f light safety  
 when calculating the weight and balance of their aircraft, pilots should use a standard 
weight for passengers only if it is truly representative of the actual passenger  weight s for 
the flight s 
 it takes more than just good written policies and procedures to achieve an acceptable 
level of flight safety.  Managers need to lead by example and ensure that pilots actually 
follow the procedures.

 Final Report 11 -006 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Commission was notified by the CAA of the incident shortly after it had occurre d.  An 
investigator inspected the site on the morning of 23 October 2011 b efore the aeroplane was 
moved and while the aerodrome was still closed.  
2.2. The pilot was formal ly interviewed at Auckland on 23 October 2011 and again by telephone on 
7 November 2011.  The Chief Executive and the Flight Standards and Training Manager were 
interviewed formally at other  times.  
2.3. The incident was discussed with the relevant managers at t he CAA.   On 16 December  2013 
the Commission heard from the Director.  
2.4. On 16 December  2013  the Commission approved the draft report for circulation to interested 
persons for their comment.  
2.5. Submissions were received from the airline, the former Quality Assura nce Manager of the 
airline, the CAA, the pilot of the Matarangi flight (see section 3.9, "Previous occurrence ") and 
the Thames -Coromandel District Council.  
2.6. On 26 February 2014 the Commission approved the report for publication.  
  
  
Final Report 11 -006

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Backg round  
3.1.1.  A tour company arranged to charter  an aeroplane from Great Barrier Airlines  on 22 October 
2011 to take 11 people on a scenic flight from Pauanui over the Bay of Plenty .  The flight was 
to return to Whitianga aerodrome , 25 kilometres north of Pauanui .  The allocated aeroplane 
was a  Britten -Norman BN.2A Mk.III -2 Trislander registered ZK -LGF, which can carry a pilot and 
up to 17 passengers.  The pilot, who wa s assigned the duty the day before  the flight, had been 
to Pauanui once before, in a light aeropl ane in 2003.  
3.1.2.  The pilot  reviewed the Aeronautical Information Publication New Zealand (AIP) information for 
Pauanui , but was not aware t hat the  airline 's Route Guide also had a section on Pauanui . 
3.1.3.  The pilot did not check the expected aeroplane performance at Pauanui because , she said,  
the airline 's Chief Executive Officer (CEO)2 had told her that the runway was adequate for the 
expected take-off weight of 4080 kilograms (kg) on the scenic flight .  The pilot  had also 
assumed  that the condition of the grass r unway at Pauanui would be good , because there had 
been no rain in the region for some days . 
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On the day of the charter, the pilot commenced duty at 0900 and flew 3 scheduled return air 
transport flights in the same aeroplane between Auckland International Airport (Auckland) and 
Claris aerodrome on Great Barrier Island.  She then had a 2 -hour break at Auckland, during 
which she obtained the weather information for the route to Pauanui and confirmed that there 
was no relevant NOTAM.3   
3.2.2.  The pilot  was a ccompanied on the flight to Pauanui by another staff member  who was to 
provide a commentary for the passengers  on the scenic flight .  Before landing at Pauanui, the 
pilot did not listen to the automatic weather information broadcast4 for the aerodrom e 
because, she s aid, the weather was good . 
3.2.3.  The aeroplane landed  shortly after 1800 and the passengers , members of a rugby tour group,  
arrived  soon afterwards.  T he staff member gave the m a safety briefing  while the pilot checked  
the fuel .  There was sufficient fuel for the flight  to Whitianga and the flight back to Auckland . 
3.2.4.  A combined l oad sheet and passenger manifest for the scenic flight had been partly 
completed in Auckland  before  the passengers' names were known (see Appendix  1).  The 
airline 's procedures required the pilot to enter  the passengers' names against the ir seat 
positions and to leave a copy of the completed form at the departure point .  That was not 
done .  The prepared load sheet showed the 2 passenger seats behind the pilot and one seat 
in the next row unoccupied i n order that t he aeroplane centre of gravity at take-off would be 
within the flight manual limits .  However, the passengers sat where they chose, with more at 
the front of the cabin  than allowed for  on the load sheet .  The pilot did not calculate the weight 
and balance of the aeroplane for  the actual seating arrangement.  
3.2.5.  At about 181 5 the pilot taxied the aeroplane for a take-off from  runway 23 .5  She said she 
positioned at the start of the runway and held the aeroplane stationary with the foot brakes 
until she had set full power .  However, independent  witnesses  and most of the passengers 
said the aeroplane became lined up with the runway at a position inset from the runway end 
and the pilot applied full power without the  aeroplane stopping.  
                                                        
2 References to the airline management appointments are to the incumbents during the periods indicated.  
3 Notices to airmen, NOTAM, provide  information concerning the establishment  of, condition of or change in any 
aeronautical facility, service , procedure or hazard.  
4 This service  automatically broadcast the current wind speed and direction , and air pressure  and temperature , when 
triggered by radio tr ansmission s made on a frequency given in the AIP .  The broadcast data was not recorded.  
5 The runway designation is the magnetic heading in the take -off direction, rounded to the nearest 10 degrees.  

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report 11 -006 3.2.6.  The pilot said her take -off technique was to raise the nose wheel just clear of the runway  when 
the airspeed was between 50 k nots (kts) and 60 kts and to rotate6 at 80 kts.  Witnesses on 
the aerodrome and  on board  said the aeroplane  accelerat ed slowly .  The pilot said she had 
thought the initial acceleration was normal, but that th e airspeed had stagnated near 60 kts.  
She had checked a gain that full power was set.  
3.2.7.  The staff member  had a pilot licence but was not qualified on the aeroplane type .  She  said 
the airspeed had increased to about 70 kts when  she saw the pilot pull ba ck fully on the 
elevator control , but the nose did not rise.  The pilot had then closed the throttles and b raked 
hard.  
3.2.8.  The pilot said she thought that the braking action had been  effective and th at th e wheels had 
not skid ded.  The  aeroplane turned slightly left of the take -off heading as it slowed , but it did 
not stop before a low wooden rail  that marked  the end of t he runway strip .  The aeroplane 
went through the rail  and stopped with the nose  wheel  about 3 m fro m a public footpath and 
subway.   The aeroplane received minor damage to the forward fuselage.  No body  was injured . 
3.3. Site examination  
3.3.1.  When the aer oplane was examined the next day , the wing flaps were at the take -off setting 
and the elevator trim set at half a unit "nose up ".  The park b rake had been  applied and the 
engine controls were at positions appropriate for the engines having been shut down.  The fuel 
selectors were off; the indicated total fuel on board was 88 U nited States  gallons (about 334 
litres).  
3.3.2.  The runway was dry and firm, except for a 3 m long patch of wet runway surface  a little over 
half-way along the runway in the take -off direction.  The aerodrome custodian was not  aware 
of the wet patch until after the incident .  There were 2 tyre t racks running through the patch , 
but they were not parallel, so they could not have been made by the dual wheels of the 
aeroplane's main landing gear.  A small amount of dried mud was on  the a ft right fuselage of 
the aeroplane, but there was none on the tyres . 
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The pilot  had obtained a New Zealand private pilot licence (aeroplane) in August 2003 and a 
commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) in August  2004.  From August  2008 until January 2010  
she had been  employed as a first officer on Twin Otter turbo -prop aeroplanes  in Samoa .  
During 2010 s he had obtained  a type rating for the Britten -Norman BN.2 "Islander " after 
training by the airline's Flight Sta ndards and Training Manager . 
3.4.2.  The airline  had hired the pilot on 1 January 2011  and she gained a type rating for the larger 
Trislander  the same day .  The flight test had included a maximum performance, or "short ", 
take-off.  Her first 13 flight hours of air transport operations in the Trislander  had been  
supervised.  On 17 J anuary 2011 she had been  "cleared for unsupervised [visual flight rules] 
air operations " except for a requirement for 2 more supervised operations from North Shore 
aerodrome . 
3.4.3.  The pilot's  most recent flight crew competency and line check s had been  completed  in the 
aeroplane o n 23 May 2011.   All of her  training and check  flights  with the airline had been  
conducted by the Flight Standards and Training Manager .  The flight check  reports stated  that 
she had completed all of these flights to a very good or high standard.  
3.4.4.  The pilot had flown the  Trislander  into 5 other aerodromes in the airline 's route network:  
Auckland, Claris and Okiwi on Great Barrier Island, North Shore and Whangarei , all of which 
had runway s longer than that at Pauanui.   Although Pauanui was not on th e usual route 
                                                        
6 To raise the nose  of an aeroplane , using the elevator contro l, to the take -off attitude .

<< Page 5 >>
 network , the airline exposition7 did not list any route or aerodrome qualification that had to be 
met before a pilot could  operat e there.  
3.4.5.  The pilot said she had been  well rested prior to the duty on 22 October 2011  and considered 
that she had been fit to fly.  The 3 previous days had been free of duty.   In the 7 days  before 
22 October 2011  she had flown 16 hours ; in the previous 30 days , 47 hours.  Her r ecent dut y 
periods  had averaged 10 hours and 45 minutes  long.  Her medical certificate was current, 
with no conditions, restrictions  or endorsements.  
3.5. Aircraft information  
3.5.1.  The Trislander was an extended cabin version of the twin-engine , 10-seat Islander , with a third 
engine in the tail .  Both types were manufactured in the United Kingdom .  The Trislander was 
powered by 3 Lycoming O -540-E4C5 engines.  The maximum take-off weight was 4536 kg. 
3.5.2.  Variants of the Trislander  have operated in New Zealand since 1989  with Standard Category 
airworthiness certificate s.  More information on the certification and regulated performance 
requirements of the aeroplane operating in New Zealand is gi ven in Appendix 2.  
3.5.3.  The aeroplane had been  imported in February 2010 and owned by Great Barrier Airlines  since 
then.  According to the airline' s maintenance records, it had been maintained in accordance 
with the approved maintenance programme.  The previous scheduled maintenance had been  
a 50 -hour airframe inspection and 100 -hour engine and propeller inspection s, carried out on 
4 October 2011 at 15 966.4 airframe hours.  
3.5.4.  No defect had been recorded in the previous 6 months that might have contributed to the 
incident .  At the time of the incident, the aeroplane had accrued 16  006 airframe hours . 
3.5.5.  The pilot did not have any concern s after the incident that a  power -plant  had been at less than 
full power.  After satisfactory e ngine and propeller checks at Pauanui , the aeroplane was flown 
to the Great Barrier Airlines  engineeri ng base for repair . 
3.5.6.  The aeroplane had been  last weighed on 12 February 2010 .  The relevant d ata from that  
weighing was used in the airline 's computerised flight planning system.  
3.6. Meteorological information  
3.6.1.  The operator's Route Guide incorrectly stated that no weather information was available for 
Pauanui and advised pilots to use the Whitianga weather.  Howeve r, routine weather 
information was not available for Whitianga either.  
3.6.2.  The flights to and from Pauanui were conducted under visual flight rules.   Witnesses said t he 
sky w as overcast  and t he westerly w ind varied from "a pretty light breeze " to "a reasonably  
stiff breeze ".  This suggested the speed  was between about 4  kts and 16 kts.8 
3.6.3.  The aeroplane altimeter sub -scale was found set to 1017 hecto pascal s, the air pressure when 
the aeroplane departed from Auckland .  At 1600 on 22 October 201 1 the pressure and air 
temperature at Tauranga Aerodrome, 80 kilometres southeast  of Pauanui , were 1015 
hectop ascal s and 19  degrees Celsius  respectively . 
3.6.4.  The most recent rain at Pauanui had been 5 days before the incident , when 18 millimetres 
were recorded at the local wastewater treatment facility , one kilometre from the aerodrome.

 Final Report 11 -006 3.7. Aerodrome information  
General  
3.7.1.  Pauanui aerodrome , established in 1972 , was owned and operated by the Thames -
Coromandel District Council.  Operational control was delegated to a local custodian .  The 
custodian was  responsible for n otifying change d operational conditions  to the Airways 
Corporation of New Zealand , which  would publish a N OTAM  or an amendment to the AIP, 
depending on the permanence of the change .  No air traffic service was  required or provided.  
3.7.2.  The grass runway , which was predominantly of compacted sand construction, was level and 
19 feet above sea level .  The AIP aerodrome diagram gave the d eclared take-off distance for 
runway 23 as  782 m , the same as the overall runway le ngth.   The Great Barrier Airlines  Route 
Guide at the time showed incorrectly  that th e runway was 850 m  long.9 
3.7.3.  The aerodrome was not certificated under Civil Aviation Rules , nor was it required to b e.  Even 
so, the CAA exercise d its power under section 15 of the Civil Aviation Act  1990  to conduct 
periodic inspections  of the runway and facilities.  Operators of non -certificated aerodromes are 
not obliged to act on findings and recommendations made during CAA inspections, although, 
according to the CAA, most do take action.  
3.7.4.  About 20 m beyond the right end of runway 23, and only 10 m off the runway centreline, was 
a skateboard park.  Inspections by the CAA in 2007 and 2011  had commented on the lack of 
fencing adjacent to the skate board park and had recommended corrective action .  The council  
later  advised t hat it had programmed work to erect fences.10 
Runway strength and condition  
3.7.5.  CAA aerodrome inspections subjectively assessed runway strength and condition.  The most 
recent inspection had been  on 24 August 2011 and, like previous inspections, had found the 
aerodrome condition to be satisfactory.  
3.7.6.  On 22 October 2011 at least 12 other aeroplanes , all less than half the maximum weight of a 
Trislander,  had used the Pauanui  runway .  Those pilots had various descriptions of the runway 
condition, depending on where on the 54 m wide runway they had landed or taken off .11  
Some, including the Trislander pilot,  said the surface had been  firm and dry ; others that it was 
soft in places and their take-off performance  had been degraded .  After t he incident , the grass 
length was measured a s 100 millimetres  in places , but it wa s generally short er. 
3.7.7.  About 4 hours before the Trislander landed, the pilots of 2 light aeroplanes taxiing along the 
southern side of runway 23 noticed a  wet patch  on the runway with  at least one tyre track 
through  it.  The patch, which was towards the southern edge of the runway, was later found to 
have been caused by a leaking feeder head in an underground irrigation system  (descri bed 
below ).  The feeder head and runway surface were repaired the next day.  
Aerodrome irrigation system  
3.7.8.  In 2009 the council had installed an irrigation system beneath the aerodrome to dispose of 
treated wastewater  from the community .  The irrigation lines were installed at a depth of 
about 450 millimetres without disturbing the surface material.  The emitter heads were c loser 
to the surface.  The AIP noted th at the aerodrome was irrigated by a subsurface  system, but 
only in regard to the use of  aircraft tie -down pegs being restricted to  designated areas.    
3.7.9.  The irrigation project team had recognised that subsurface  saturation could affect aircraft 
operations.  In 2002 tests had show n that the runway surface did not saturate with discharge 
volumes of up to 300 cubic metres per day.  The project engineer advised that saturation was 
                                                        
9 The aerodrome diagram was issued 18 November 2010.  The previous edition gave the runway length as 850 m, which 
was reduced because the threshold locations changed.  O n 4 April 2013  the runway length was amended back to 848 m .

 unlikely at depths shallower than 350 millimetres.  He was unaware of any measurement of 
the runway strengt h during the experimental discharges or at any other time.  
3.7.10.  Although the council had recognised that unspecified "tensions " could arise from the 
integration of a wastewater infrastructure with aerodrome operations12, its documents also 
showed that consent ha d been sought to increase the daily discharge rate well above the 
levels tested.  
3.7.11.  According to the council's project engineer, the consent  current at the time of the incident was 
for discharges of 60 cubic metres per day.  However, records showed that an av erage of 140 
cubic metres of effluent had been  discharged under the aerodrome each day from 17 October 
to 19 October 2011.  
3.8. Organisational and management information  
3.8.1  The airline had been  established in 1983  with its  main b ase at Auckland  and its associated 
engineering company  at the secondary base at North Shore.   The airline held air operator 
certificates to conduct operations under Civil Aviation Rules Part 135 (small aeroplanes, like 
the Islander) and Part 125 (medium -sized aeroplanes, such as the Trislan der).  A mixed fleet 
of 10 aeroplanes was used for s cheduled services between Auckland, North Shore and Great 
Barrier Island and unscheduled services to other aerodromes.  
3.8.2  The CEO was a pilot who had been employed by Great Barrier Airlines  since October 200 7 and 
who had been appointed to the CEO role in August 2011.  He was rated to fly the Trislander 
and flew air transport operations occasionally.  
3.8.3  The Flight Standards and Training Manager had been in the role for more than 5 years.  His 
primary job as a pil ot with a major airline limited the time he could give to Great Barrier 
Airline s matters . 
3.8.4  The Operations Manager was a retired airline pilot with experience in airline management and 
regulatory roles.  The CAA had accepted his appointment in 2008.  
3.8.5  CAA records showed that t he management of the airline  had been a long-term concern to the 
CAA.  During a special investigation of the company by the CAA in July 2008, the main issues 
identified had been : 
 the availability of senior persons  and confusion over th eir responsibilities  
 an ineffective internal quality assurance programme   
 various cases of non-compliance with the Civil A viation Rules and the company's 
exposition.  
3.8.6  Similar  issues  were found  during a routine audit conducted by the CAA in October 201 0 and 
during  a spot check  in September 2011.   In late January 2012 the CAA conducted an audit of 
the management and general operations at the airline and found deficiencies similar to those 
identified in  the September 2011 spot check  and during the initial inves tigation of the 
Pauanui incident .  Finding Notices issued  during  the September 2011 spot check  had not  
been closed (that is, corrective actions  had not been  completed) more than 8 months after the 
agreed due date .13 
3.8.7  The ownership and management of the airline changed on 1 Janua ry 2012 .  The CEO became 
Operations Manager and a previous CEO re turned to  that role.

 Final Report 11 -006 3.8.8  Civil Aviation Rule 125 .5 stated, in part:  
Each holder of an air operator certificate shall ensure that all persons employed 
… by the holder … are familiar with the appropriate sections of the Act, Civil 
Aviation Rules, and procedures specified in the certificate holder's exposition.  
In the contex t of this incident , Great Barrier Airlines  was responsible for ensuring that the pilot 
met all route and aerodrome qualification requirements for making the flight from Pauanui 
and that she was trained in the policies and procedures applicable to the opera tion.14  Each 
pilot was required to have completed within the immediately preceding 12 months a written or 
oral test that covered, among many subjects, the performance  and content of the flight 
manual for each aeroplane type normally flown by the pilot.   Great Barrier Airlines  could not 
produce records to show what performance knowledge had been tested . 
3.9. Previous occurrence  
3.9.1  On 20 October 2011, 2  days before the Pauanui incident , a different pilot had flown  the same 
aeroplane to the grass Matarangi aerodrome on Coromandel Peninsula .  He said that before 
the flight he had calculated that the runway length was adequate.  H e had loaded  9 
passengers  from a rugby tour group , but not in accordance with the prepared load sheet.  The 
pilot had rejected the take-off because of the aeroplane's poor accelerati on on the soft  
runway .  The pilot  asked 2 passengers to sit further back  in the cabin  before he made  another  
take-off attempt , but the y opted to travel by car.   The pilot then obtained revised weight and 
balance data  from the Auckland base prior to making a safe take -off.  
3.9.2  About 3 weeks previously the same  pilot had cancelled a flight to Matarangi after the 
aerodrome operator had advised that the runway was sof t.  He had not check ed the runway 
condition before the 20 October 2011 flight  because the CEO had told him a week beforehand 
that it was good.  The pilot later recalled that heavy rain had affected Auckland on 19 October 
2011 , and he noted that the rain could have extended to Matarangi.  The AIP entry for 
Mataran gi note d "standing water on both sides of runway at mid -point after heavy rain " and 
"runway floods at mid -point after very heavy rain ".15 
 
3.10.  CAA surveillance and intervention policies  
  
3.10.1  The CAA's "Regulatory Operating Model" (CAA, 2012a)  assumed continued eff ective operation 
by air operators of the management systems required by the Act and defined in the Rules.  
The CAA audits and spot checks of operators  periodically tested the validity of that 
assump tion.  Auditing was one of the surveillance  tools described in the CAA's " Use of 
Regulatory Tools" policy (CAA, 2102b).  In the case of a serious risk to safety, the CAA could 
consider using an administrative tool such as suspension or revocation of the certificate held 
by the person or organisatio n.16 
3.10.2  The preferred (and usual) means by which the CAA addressed a significant risk to public safety 
was to require some corrective action.  Whether the action taken was voluntary or imposed, 
the policy noted that there was "an understanding that similar non-compliance or failure of 
risk control measures will not be accepted and co uld result in the escalation in the severity of 
the regulatory tool applied."  
3.10.3  A finding notice was  evidence of non -compliance with legislation or a rule, or some procedure 
requir ed by a rule.  The CAA stated that a document holder continued to be non -compliant 
until the agreed corrective action was completed (CAA, 2012c).  Therefore timely closing of 
finding  notice s was necessary for a safe system.  
                                                        
14 Civil Aviation Rule 125.503 (a).  
15 AIP page NZAG AD 2 -51.1, 22 September 2011.  
16 The CAA introduced its Use of Regulatory Tools policy on 23 September 2011, one month before the Pauanui incident .  
The Surveillance Policy had been in place since 2006 .   
  
Final Report 11 -006

3.10.4  The CAA considered the followin g factors, and others, when deciding what action to take with 
regard to the use of regulatory tools (CAA, 2013):  
 whether an unacceptable safety risk remains that must be mitigated  
 the compliance history of the document holder  
 whether a non -compliance has g iven rise to unnecessary danger to persons or property  
 whether factors involving the public interest and safety are present, such as the use of 
aircraft on an air transport operation  
 whether the document holder has heeded previous warnings or actions  
 the d ocument holder's attitude to safety.  
3.10.5  The CAA recognised that it would not be appropriate to continue seek ing voluntary complian ce 
by issuing  more finding notices if there had been on -going significant non -compliance.   In such 
cases it would consider other methods of regulatory intervention.

 Final Report 11 -006 4. Analysis  
4.1 Introduction  
4.1.1  Runway excursions are recognised globally as  a major risk to aviation safety .  The outcome of 
an excursion depends on variables such as the aeroplane size  and speed , and whether it 
encounters obstacles when it leaves the runway.  
4.1.2  The Pauanui incident occurred after the pilot rejected  the take -off because of concern for the 
aeroplane 's take-off performance.  The aeroplane was slow to accelerate  and the pilot was 
unable to raise the nose of the ai rcraft off the runway to take  off.  As she doubted that the 
aeroplane would fly, rejecting the take -off was an appropriate action . 
4.1.3  The Commission has concluded that the aeroplane had no chance of a successful take -off due 
to a combination of issues with th e aeroplane 's weight and balance  and possibly the surface 
condition of the runway.  An improper take -off technique was also a factor contributing to the 
overrun.  These issues are first discussed , before considering the following general safety 
issues  that were identified in the inquiry : 
 the standard of pilot training and supervision of operation s at Great Barrier Airlines 
was below that required   
 the CAA had had recurring concerns for the management and standard of operations 
at Great Barrier Airlines during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions taken 
to address those concerns had been largely ineffective  
 the council had not evaluated the effect s of the subsurface  runway irrigation system 
on the maximum ESWL for the Pauanui runway . 
4.2 The dir ect causes of the Pauanui runway excursion  
4.2.1  The weather conditions were not a factor .  The aeroplane take-off configuration was correct 
and there was no evidence  that any aeroplane technical factor  contributed to the incident.  
4.2.2  The degraded performance was due to  the following factors , which are discussed in turn:  
 the aeroplane weight and balance  were not as planned  
 the take -off distance available  was insufficient  
 the pilot's take -off technique was inappropriate  
 the aeroplane was too heavy for the runway surface.  
4.2.3  The pilot was completely unaware of these impediments to a safe take -off because she had 
not plan ned adequately for the flight.  She did not appreciate the actual weight or calculate 
the expected performance.  Great Barrier Airlines  contributed to  the incident  through its 
inadequate supervision of operations.  
The aeroplane weight and balance  
4.2.4  A load sheet shows the amount and distribution of the items that make up the total weight of 
an aircraft.  A load sheet  must be completed for every flight to s how compliance with weight 
and balance  limits , including that the centre of gravity will remain within the limits during the 
flight.17  Adherence to the flight manual centre of gravity limits is critical for safe flight.  
4.2.5  The aeroplane's elevators control th e pitch  attitude of the aeroplane.  They are a fixed 
distance behind the main landing wheels.  When the pilot pulls back on the controls to take  off 
(rotates), the elevators are attempting to raise the nose of the aeroplane  by pivoting the 
aeroplane on its  main wheels.  If the aeroplane's centre of gravity is too far forward ( "nose 
heavy ") it will be more difficult to raise the nose .  This was the primary reason for the 
                                                        
17 Civil Aviation Rules 125.305 and 125.307.

 unsuccessful take -off.  The pilot applied full aft elevator in an attempt to rotate the aeroplane 
to the take -off attitude, but that control input had no effect . 
4.2.6  The load sheet for the Pauanui flight is shown in Appendix  1.  The passenger manifest section 
of the sheet  does not show the names o f the passengers o r where they sat .  The pilot should 
have directed the passengers to seat s marked  as "occupied " in the pre-planned loading 
arrangement  shown  at the bottom left corner of the sheet , and recorded their names against 
the appropr iate seat number s.  The load sheet  was partially completed at the operator's base.  
The load sheet  showed that the aeroplane's weight and balance were  within permissible 
limits, but this assum ed that the pilot would direct  passengers to the designated seats and 
that the average passenger weight was close to the standard weight of 81  kg.18  Neither was 
the case  on this flight : the pilot allowed the passengers to sit where they chose  and the ir 
average weight was later calculat ed to be 101  kg.  The pilot said that she thought the 
passengers looked "average ". 
4.2.7  The passengers did not have any significant carry -on baggage.  Using the declared passenger 
weights, the aeroplane weight before take -off was calculated to have been about 4294 kg, 
which was 214 kg  over the pre -planned 4080 kg.  
4.2.8  The total aeroplane weight was less than the maximum permitted  weight, but the actual 
weights and seating positions of the passengers put the aero plane centre of gravity well 
forward of the allowable range .19  The allowable range for the Tri slander centre of gravity 
position was very  narrow compared with those of  other  aeroplanes commonly used for air 
transport  (see Appendix 3) . 
4.2.9  Later calculations using the declared passenger weights showed that even if the seat plan had 
been followed, the centre of gravity position would have been very dependent on which 
passenger sat where and could still have been ahead of the forward limit.  Had t he Pauanui 
pilot recognise d that actual passenger we ights  should have been used, an acceptable 
aeroplane weight and balance might have been achieved  for that flight . 
4.2.10  The load sheet had provision for change s to the load weight, but not for calculating any 
resultant change in the centre of gravity position.  Pilots were required to telephone the 
Auckland base for that revised data , as the Matarangi pilot did.  This system might work most 
of the time, but as pilot s are responsib le for ensuring that the weight and balance of their 
aeroplane s are within the allowable limits , it would have been prudent  for the operator to 
provide them  with a ready means to calculate it themselves .  The operator later advised that it 
would provide pilots with a manual weight and balance form.  
4.2.11  Great Barrier Airlines' procedures  provided for situations when passengers did not appear to 
be of "standard " weight by requiring th at th eir actual weights be used .  The Operations Manual 
stated that scales were to be taken in the aeroplane when passengers were to be boarded at 
an aerodrom e without check -in scales , unless the passengers' weights had been notified to 
the company in advance .  In this case, t he passenger weights were not notified in advance  
and the airline did not have any portable scales for the pilot to take  to Pauanui .20  Matarangi  
was another aerodrome without check -in scales, yet the load sheet for the charter flight from 
there on 20 October 2011 was also prepared using standard weights.21  Therefore, the use of 
standard weights appeared to be  the airline's normal practice  for all load sheets .  The 
operator later advised that it intended to use actual passenger weights on all future flights.  
4.2.12  Although the operator  had documented weight and balance procedures , in practice the y were 
not all followed  by its pilots .  In both the  Pauanui and Matarangi incidents , the pilots had not 
seated their passengers in accordance with the planned loading arrangement s. 
                                                        
18 The standard weight did not include the weight of personal carry -on baggage, which was weighed separately.  It came 
from a  survey of passenger s' weights con ducted by the operator in January  2010  and was approved by the CAA . 
19 The estimated position was 254 millimetres aft of the datum.  The forward limit was 500 millimetres aft of the datum  
20 The operator's investigation into the Pauanui incident s tated that scales had been purchased to correct this deficiency.   
21 See section 3.9 .

 Final Report 11 -006 Findings:  
1. The primary reason for the aeroplane 's failure to take off was that its centre of 
gravity was well forward of the maximum permissible limit . 
2. Neither the pilot nor Great Barrier Airlines  had calculated the actual weight and 
balance of the aeroplane prior to the flight.  
3. Great Barrier Airlines  had not provided the portable scales that were necessary for 
the pilot to comp ly with the airline's procedure s for determining the aeroplane 
weight and balance.  
 
The take -off distance available  and aeroplane handling technique  
4.2.13  Aircraft flight manuals include chapters on "scheduled performance " that contain the data 
needed to determine the expected performance of the aircraft under stated conditions  - for 
example, the maximum weight for take -off at a given altitude and air temperature; the 
maximum altitude achievable with a specified weight and temperature; and the take -off 
distance required.   
4.2.14  The flight manual charts or tables for calculating the take -off distance required  include 
corrections for different types of runway surface , typically  paved (asphalt or concrete) surfaces 
and firm, dry gra ss.22  On grass or soft runways, such as Pauanui w ith its sand subsoil , the 
rolling resistance of the tyres is higher, which increases the take -off ground run.  Long or wet 
grass further increases the distance required, but the effect is too variable for co rrection 
factor s to be given.  
4.2.15  The take -off speed of an aeroplane is directly related to its gross weight.  In general, a heavy 
aeroplane will accelerate more slowly and must reach a higher speed than a lighter aeroplane 
of the same type before it can take off.  The heavy aeroplane therefore needs a longer ground 
run. 
4.2.16  The pilot had operated Trislanders at weights up to the maximum permitted for take -off, but 
only from longer, paved runways  such as North Shore aerodrome .  Her expectation that the 
take-off per formance at Pauanui would be similar to what she was used to at North Shore 
indicated that she did not fully  understand th e variables of aeroplane performance . 
4.2.17  The flight manual stated that the take -off safety speed was the speed at which the pilot should 
raise the nose to the take -off attitude.23  The speed varied directly with the aeroplane weight, 
up to a maximum of 70 kts.  The take -off safety speed for the planned take -off weight at 
Pauanui was 67 kts, but the pilot said she had been  aiming to rotate at  80 kts.  Her choice 
was likely influenced by an informal take -off safety speed used within the airline.  The C EO 
said it used 80 kts for all weights and sometimes 90 kts when taking off at Auckland.  The 
Flight Standards and Training Manager said that 90 kts would be  unusual,  but a higher speed 
was useful at Auckland when traffic was busy because it gave a better climb rate and allowed 
an earlier turn after take -off. 
4.2.18  The flight manual take -off performance data was based on all engines operating at maximum 
continuous power (2700 revolutions per minute /full throttle), the wing flaps set to 25 degrees 
and the aeroplane being "held on the ground until the appropriate take -off safety speed ".24  
These conditions implied that, for ma ximum performance, the engines would be  set to 
maximum power before the brakes were released for the take -off run and the aeroplane nose 
would be rotated at 70 kts.  The Flight Standards and Trainin g Manager stated that this was 
                                                        
22 The take -off distance required is t he distance to take  off and climb to 50 f eet.

 the method taught and one that the pilot had performed competently on a check flight.  
However, on the incident flight she performed a rolling take -off. 
4.2.19  The assumed conditions for calculating the expected aeroplane performanc e on take -off were 
1015 hectopascals, 18 degrees Celsius and a head wind of 10 kts.  Using the se values, the 
take-off distance s required from a dry, paved  runway w ere determined to be a bout  620 m at 
the planned weight and 680 m at the calculated weight.25  The flight manual required these 
distances to be increased by 15% when taking off from "dry grass runways with freshly cut 
grass and firm subsoil ".26  With that correction, the take -off distances required were 
approximately 713 m and 782 m respectively.   The actual length of the runway was 782 m, so 
the aeroplane should have been able to take off, provided no other factors degraded its 
performance ( for example, the runway condition or an improper centre of gravity position ). 
4.2.20  The Great Barrier Airlines  standa rd operating procedures noted the Civil Aviation Rule that the 
take-off distance required for an air transport flight shall not exceed 85% of the take -off run 
available.27 That was 665 m in the case of the 782 m long runway at Pauanui.  Therefore the 
Pauanui runway was not long enough, even at the originally planned take -off weight.   The CEO 
later acknowledged that he had not considered this Rule before telling the pilot th at Pauanui 
would be acc eptable for the scenic flight . 
4.2.21  In the Matarangi incident, the pilot did determine that the runway would be long enough.  
However, his calculation of 610 m for the take -off distance required was based on a firm, dry 
runway with short grass.  Although the flight manual did not provide any corrections for wet or 
long grass, a longer distance would have been required because both factors were present.  
Therefore it was very likely that the actual take -off distance required would have exce eded 
655 m, which was the maximum under the "85% of distance available " requirement.  
4.2.22  The similarities between the 2 rejected take -off incidents showed that the airline 's pilots, 
including the CEO, did not have the required understanding of the Civil Aviation Rules or the 
airline 's own policies and procedures in regard to aircraft performance.  This indicated 
inadequate training and supervision of operations within Great  Barrier Airlines . 
4.2.23  The flight manual noted that "the take -off run required will not exceed, and must be taken as, 
61% of the take -off distance [required] ".  On that basis, the scheduled take -off run at the 
estimated take -off weight was 477 m.  The actual g round run would have been longer 
because the rolling take -off was commenced at  an inset position, rather than at the runway 
end. 
4.2.24  Great Barrier Airlines ' Route Guide showed incorrectly that the Pauanui runway was 850 m 
long (rather than 782 m).  That error could have been a factor in the CEO 's advising the pilot 
that the runway would be long enough.  No other runway distances were given in the Guide.  
Although the pilot did not refer to the Guide, an incorrect and partial list of runway data could 
mislead pi lots if they used the Guide for determining performance.  For example, the Guide did 
not show that the take -off distance available (at that time) on runway 05 was only 707 m.  The 
airline  later removed any data from the Guide that was already provided in the AIP.  
4.2.25  Aeroplane performance was rarely a critical factor at the aerodromes in Great Barrier Airlines ' 
scheduled route network, but it should have been an essential consideration f or a non -
scheduled flight to a rarely used aerodrome.  Assessing t he feasi bility of a flight, which was no 
doubt done when the charter flight request was received, was no substitute for the assigned 
pilot calculating the actual performance using the weight and environmental conditions 
pertaining on the day .

 Final Report 11 -006 Finding : 
4. There were 3  factors that contributed to the aeroplane overrunning the end of the 
runway when the pilot ab andon ed the take -off: 
 the aeroplane was too heavy for the available length of  the Pauanui runway and 
the safety margin  required by Civil Aviation Rules  
 the pilot did not use all of the available runway  
 the pilot  did not use the appropriate  technique for a successful  take-off. 
 
The runway condition  
Safety issue - The council had not evaluated the effect s of the subsurface  runway irrigation 
system on the maximum equivalent single wheel load  for the Pauanui runway . 
4.2.26  Reduced acceleration during a take -off roll can result when the aeroplane is too heavy for the 
runway surface and the tyres "sink" into the surface.  Runways can be damaged if aeroplanes 
are operated at weights above the design limit weight s for the runway s.  Civil Aviation Rule 
125.77, Use of Aerodromes , required the holder of an air operator certificate to ensure that 
the aerodromes it used when performing air tr ansport operations had physical characteristics 
appropriate to the aeroplanes being used, and that the ru nways had sufficient strength.  
4.2.27  The usual measure of the load imposed by a small or medium aeroplane28 on a runway is the 
equivalent single wheel load  (ESWL).  The ESWL is a simplified way of accounting for the 
actual weight of the aeroplane and its landing gear configuration .  The ESWL for an aeroplane 
with one wheel per main landing gear leg is fixed at 45% of the actual weight  of the 
aeroplane .29  Multi -wheel configurations, such as the dual main wheels of the Trislander, have 
lower ESWL s. 
4.2.28  The training syllabi for the various pilot licences did not specify "ESWL " as a knowledge 
requirement, but the need was implied by the following syllabus items (in this  case, taken from 
the Commercial Pilot Licence syllabus):30 
16.50.4 Describe the publications and their content that provide operational 
route and aerodrome information.  
16.50.6 Derive operational information from charts and publications that provide 
route and aerodrome information.  
16.76.10 Interpret information on aerodrome/heliport charts , AIP GEN & AIP 
Volume 4.  
4.2.29  The AIP referred aeroplane operators to the CAA for advice on the ESWL s for specific 
aeroplane types. The CAA advised that the value for dual main wheels was 80% of that for 
single wheels; that is, 36% of the actual aeroplane weight.31 
4.2.30  The pilot in the Pauanui incident said she did not know the Trislander 's maximum ESWL or 
how to calculate it.  The flying school where she had completed her pilot training did cover the 
subject of ESWL, but once a pilot moved to larger aeroplanes and airports there might be few 
occasions when the information was important .  Therefore, the knowled ge was soon forgotten.  
4.2.31  It was incumbent upon operators to identify and address knowledge and skill gaps applicable 
to their operations.  In this case, Great Barrier Airlines  could not show that it had determined 
the maximum weights for each of its aeroplane types to ensure that aerodrome ESWL limits 
                                                        
28 Which may be taken to mean aeroplanes having a maximum certificated take -off weight less than 5700 kg.

gears , published in 1952 , advised that  the ESWL for a dual main wheel configuration could be 30% of the actual weight.

 were observed.   Following this incident , Great Barrier Airlines advised the CAA that it would 
restrict Trislander operations to paved runways only.  
4.2.32  The maximum ESWL for the Pauanui runway was 1140 kg, or 910 kg in wet conditions .32  
Using the figure of 36% of the aeroplane weight , the ESWL of the aeroplane on 22 October 
2011 was 1469 kg for the planned take -off and 1546 kg for the a ttempted take -off.  Both 
values exceeded the maximum ESWL for the Pauanui runway  when it was dry . 
4.2.33  Similarly, with the previous incident at Matarang i aerodrome , the runway ESWL limit was 910 
kg, with no lower "wet" limit.  The calculated ESWL for the first take-off attempt on 20 October 
2011 was 1452 kg and 1352 kg for the actual take -off.  Again the aeroplane exceeded the 
ESWL for th e runway.  
4.2.34  The estimated take -off weights in both the Pauanui and Matarangi incidents were less than 
the maximum certificated t ake-off weight s for the aeroplane s, but they excee ded the more 
restrictive ESWL s. 
4.2.35  Comments from other pilots who had operated light aircraft at Pauanui on 22 October 2011  
suggested that the runway strength had not been affected significantly by recent rain or 
wastewater  discharges .  However, t he Trislander was much heavier than the other aeroplanes , 
which meant  that its wheels were more likely to have experienc ed increased rolling resistance 
from the sandy subsoi l, thus affecting the aeroplane's  acceler ation .  The wastewater volumes 
discharged in the preceding week were  more than twice the consented daily volumes .  
However, testing had shown that the rate of discharge would not cause surface saturation.   
Furthermore, the most recent wastewater  discharge had been  3 days before the incident  
4.2.36  The council did not know the origin of the published values of maximum ESWL or what effect 
wastewater discharges would have on the runway bearing strength.  As the aerodrome 
operator , the council was responsible for the accuracy of aerodrome information published in 
the AIP.  Therefore, the council ought to have establish ed accurate values for the ESWL 
including any reduced bearing strength caused by wastewater discharges under the runway.   It 
also needs to be wary of mon itoring and maintaining the irrigation system.  As shown in this 
case, leaks in the irrigation system can affect the runway surface in that area.  
4.2.37  The Commission is recommending to the council that it establish accurate values for the 
ESWL s at the aerodrome s it operates and that it determine whether a "wet" ESWL is 
appropriate at the Pauanui aerodrome while a wastewater discharge is underway and for any 
period after th e discharge has ended.  
 
Findings:  
5. The Trislander aeroplane exceeded the equivalent single wheel load  for the Pauanui 
runway .  The possibility could not be excluded that the sandy subsoil increased the 
rolling resistance on the wheels, which would have degraded the take -off 
acceleration . 
6. Great Barrier Airlines  had not considered whether its aero planes complied with the 
equivalent single wheel load  at the aerodromes it used.  An excessive equivalent 
single wheel load could affect take -off performance and damage runway surface s. 
7. The aerodrome operator did not know the origin of the published maximum 
equivalent single wheel load  values and had not determined the effect s of 
subsurface  irrigation on the runway strength.   Incorrect or unknown equivalent single 
wheel load  data could affect the safety of aerodrome operations by reducing the 
take-off performance of a eroplanes  using the runway.

 Final Report 11 -006 4.3 Training and s upervision  deficiencies  
Safety issue: The standard of pilot training and the supervision of operations at Great Barrier 
Airlines was below that required . 
4.3.1  The Pauanui pilot had approximately 1500 flight hours as well as 9 months ' service with Great 
Barrier Airlines.  That experience and the airline's training ought to have ensured that she 
could perform the flight safely, which was her responsibility as the pilot -in-command.  
4.3.2  A number of personal kn owledge and skill deficiencies were identified that indicated the pilot 
did not, on the Pauanui flight, me et the standard required of a pilot-in-command of a n air 
transport flight .  These included : 
 not adequate ly planning for the flight  
 a low understanding  of scheduled performance  
 not having accurate weight and balance data  
 not complying with some of Great Barrier Airlines ' policies and procedures.  
4.3.3  The pilot did not recognise that the aeroplane weight  and aerodrome conditions required her 
to conduct  a maximum -performance take -off or that a successful take -off might be unlikely . 
4.3.4  The pilot accepted the CEO's statement that the Pauanui runway would be suitable for the 
planned flight , and did not check the performance charts  for that reason .  The more 
exper ienced pilot-in-command of the aeroplane at Matarangi also accepted old information 
about that aerodrome from the CEO.  In each case, given that the aerodrome was rarely used 
by Great Barrier A irline s, the pilot ought to have obtained the current aerodrome  information 
and critically evaluated the expected aeroplane performance before the flight.  Pilots-in-
command have  individual responsibilit ies to perform that planning33 and the a irline  has a 
responsibility to make the information readily available  to its pilots .34 
4.3.5  The CEO misled both pilots to some degree and overlooked a mandatory performance 
requirement.  It is especially important, given their influence on the organisation's culture and 
level of compliance, that senior persons in an airline have strong operational knowledge and 
demonstrate best practice  for more junior pilots in their employment . 
4.3.6  When the same mistakes and errors are made by diff erent people who work in an airline, it is 
an indicat ion of systemic deficienc ies.  The Great Barrier A irlines  exposition included the 
required  policies  and procedures .  Had all of its pilots been complying with its policies and 
procedures, neither this incident nor th at at  Matarangi should have occurred .  However, the 
airline management had not ensured, pa rticularly in the case of the Pauanui flight, that the 
pilot, aeroplane and aerodrome were suitable for the flight.  
4.3.7  After the Pauanui incident, Great Barrier Airlines  advised the CAA that it had suspended flights 
into Pauanui and "other marginal airfields " until it was "satisfied that the aircraft and crew 
[were] suitably qualified to conduct such flights ".  The CEO said that the "refresher" training 
session held in early November 2011  in response to the 2 runway incidents emphasised 
compliance with standard operating procedures .  The operator later advised that it would 
formalise periodic test ing of pilots' knowledge of standard operati ng procedures .  
4.3.8  A CAA spot check  in September 2011, 5 weeks before the Pauanui incident, had asked the 
operations manager about the airline's documented procedure for authorising charter flights 
"to ensure that all new airfields are risk assessed and only appropriately qualified pilots are 
assigned  [to the flight] ".  The operator did not consider Pauanui to be a "new" a erodrome, 
even though  it was rarely used .  Therefore,  the Operations Manager  had not been involved in 
authorising the Pauanui charter.  The airline said that, f ollowing  the Pauanui and Matarangi 
incident s in 2011 , it had amended its policy to require  every  charter flight to be subjected to a

 risk assessment prior to specific authorisation.   However, the January 2012 audit issued a 
finding notice because the airline had "no apparent process for the authorisation of non -
scheduled flights".   A proactive operator  would have immediately heeded the earlier advice of 
auditors.  This airline  did not react  promptly, even after a serious incident had occurred.  
4.3.9  Following these 2 occurrences t he Flight Standards and Training Manager reviewed the pilot 
training and  checking programme, for which he was responsible .  He found no issues , yet the 
occurrences showed that there were safety issues with the way the check and training 
programme was working .  The operator dealt with the matter  by restricting future Trislander  
operations to sealed runways only.   While this action might have resolve d problems with how 
the airline's procedures deal t with flight authorisation and planning, it d id not resolve the 
issue of a sub -standard check and training program me for its pilots.  
4.3.10  Pauanui and Matarangi  were not on the airline 's normal route network , but  were considered to 
be included in the general route and aerodrome qualification s of pilots.   In spite of that, the 
airline's report to the CAA on the incident included  a finding that the pilot had not been 
previously checked into Pauanui.  O n 27 October 2011 , without a route check and presumably 
on the basis of the incident flight, the CEO signed and added a Pauanui aerodrome 
qualification to the pilot's training file.   The operator  later instituted an Aerodrome Assessment 
form to be used in conjunction with flight authorisations for non -scheduled flights.  
4.3.11  The holder of an air operator certificate is required to ensure that its pilots have the requisite 
knowledge, amongs t other things, of the route and aerodromes to be used and the operator's 
policies and procedures appropriate to its air operations.35  The pilot at Pauanui (and, to a 
lesser extent , the pilot at Matarangi ) demonstrated some knowledge and skill deficiencies  that 
the a irline  should have identif ied and corrected.  
4.3.12  An effective check and training system, along with an effective internal audit system, should 
be able to identify and close knowledge and skill gaps like those described.   
4.3.13  An inspection of the load sheets for flights by other pilots found that indicated seat allocations 
and loading arrangement s often did not correlate.  The operator later explained that seat 
allocations were only correct when used in conjunction with actual pass enger weights.  While 
these discrepancies  did not prove that the earlier flights had been incorrectly loaded, the y did 
mean there was no documented proof that those flights had operated within flight manual 
limits.  Great Barrier Airlines  later emphasised to its staff the need to seat passengers 
according to the prepared loading arrangements .   
4.3.14  A similar inaccuracy in form use was evident in the Pauanui load sheet incorrectly show ing the 
route as AA (Auckland) to GB (Great Barrier - Claris).  The manifest f or the Matarangi charter 
flight had th e same  error.  Although these  might seem to be minor  errors , internal audit s had 
evidently not identified them  and pilots evidently tolerated them .  Whether that response is an  
indicator of tolerance or c omplacency , the frequent errors of this sort showed that  Great 
Barrier Airlines  did not en sure compliance with its published polic ies and procedures . 
4.3.15  More serious was the airline's  informal adoption of a "standard " take-off safety speed of 80 
kts.  While th is typically did not jeopardise flight safety , the practice could have an  adverse 
outcome, as happened at Matarangi and Pauanui , if the conditions for its safe use were not 
fully appreciated by pilots .  The airline later said it would formalise the procedure for use 
where runway length allowed . 
4.3.16  Poor supervision of operations was inevitable when there was confusion between 
management roles and responsibilities.  That problem was identified in the routine audit of 
October 2010  and the spot audit of September 2011 , and was  evident after the Pauanui 
incident when managers could not agree who had approved the charter.  
4.3.17  Great Barrier Airlines  initially assessed the Matarangi rejected take -off as an "acceptable risk ".  
After the Pauanui incident 2 days later, the CEO suspended flights into Pauanui, but only

 Final Report 11 -006 because he understood the runway condition was poor.  The CEO was not responsible for 
suspending operations.  The airline's  exposition stated36: 
The Operations Mana ger is the person responsible to restrict or suspend 
operations if any condition exists that is a hazard to safe operations.  
4.3.18  According to the Operations Manual, the appropriate person to approve flights was also the 
Operations Manager.  However, o n 31 Octo ber 2011 the airline  issued the following Notice to 
Pilots, which was later incorporated into the Operations Manual:  
Until further notice, all charter flights to/from non -certificated airfields, or any 
other than Auckland, Great Barrier, North Shore, Whang arei, Kaitaia are not to be 
quoted or commenced until approval from BOTH the [Quality Assurance Manager 
and Flight Standards and Training Manager] is sought.  
4.3.19  The confusion of management roles was still present when the CAA audited the airline in 
January 20 12. 
Finding s: 
8. Systemic deficiencies within the management of the Great Barrier Air lines  operation 
contribut ed to the aeroplane overrunning the runway at Pauanui.  These deficiencies 
included:  
 the pilot check and training program me did not ensure that all pilots were 
appropriately qualified to operate into all aerodromes shown in the airline's  
exposition  
 there was uncertainty around the allocation of responsibilities between  senior 
managers and pilots in the airline  
 internal audits had failed to identify frequent non -compliance with the airline's  
standard operating procedures.  
9. A culture of acceptance of non -conforming practices existed within the Great Barrier 
Airline s operation, in spite of external audits in the 3 years preceding  the Pauanui 
incident having indicat ed that th is was a safety issue.  
4.4 Regulatory oversight  
Safety issue: The CAA had had recurring concerns for the management and standard of 
operations at Great Barrier Airlines during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions 
taken to address those concerns had been ineffective . 
Prior to February 2012  
4.4.1  The standard of management and flight operations in Great Barrier Airlines had concerned the 
CAA for more than 3 years prior to the Pauanui incident, but the necessary improvements had 
not been forthcoming.  Audit reports had identified various, sometimes repeated, deficiencies 
in the airline's exposition, policies , procedures.  
4.4.2  In June 2008 Great Barrier Airlines had been  due for a scheduled 5 -yearly re -certification  ('re-
entry ').37  During preliminary meetings with the airline , a CAA flight operations inspector had 
formed the view th at there was "a serious lack of day -to-day management" within the airline.  
Other major deficiencies had been  identified with the airline's compliance with quality 
assurance requirements and its exposition generally.  
                                                        
36 Great Barrier Airlines' exposition, p aragr aph 3.1.16.  
37 Initial certification and r e-entry involved check s that the document holder's exposition complied fully with all relevant 
legislated requirements.  Subsequent audits primarily checked that the document holder  was acting in  compliance with 
their  exposition.  
  
Final Report 11 -006 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.4.3  As a result of those observations, the CAA had immediately investigated the airline under 
section  15A of the Civil Aviation Act 1990.  The specific safety concerns stated by the CAA 
were that : 
 the internal quality assurance programme was ineffective  
 the airline's policy condoned the non -reporti ng of in -service aeroplane defects  
 the airline management (at that time) did not provide adequate supervision and  direction.  
The CAA  required the airline to complete corrective actions before it renew ed the air operator 
certificate  in July 2008  (for 6 months  only). 
4.4.4  One corrective action had been  to restructure the airline's senior management.  The CAA had 
interviewed the operations manager in July 2008 prior to confirming acceptance of his 
nomination for that role.  At that time the CAA noted the manage r's aviation experience and 
apparent strong safety focus, and his commitment to an efficient quality assurance system.  
However, the CAA's expectation of a turnaround in the conduct of the airline was not fulfilled .  
Subsequent audits continued to make findings on management issues and quality assurance.  
4.4.5  Due to t he recurring  management issues at the airline the CAA categorise d the airline as "high 
risk".  The means used by the CAA to try to force change and improvement at the airline were  
to issu e the ai r operator certificate for a short term  only,  and to conduct more frequent routine 
audits and spot checks . 
4.4.6  In late January 2012 the CAA conducted a routine audit  of the management and general 
operations at the airline .  At that stage the new management tea m had been in place for less 
than a month.   Prior to the audit, the CAA had identified some Route Guide and exposition 
deficiencies that were pertinent to the Pauanui incident.  The audit made 22 finding s, with 
some similar to those made in  the September 2 011 spot check .  They includ ed the following:  
 the lack of a process for authorising non -scheduled flights  
 management reviews were held less frequently than was stipulated in the exposition  
 there was no published procedure for risk assessment and no system  for aircraft 
document amendment  
 the load sheet passenger manifests did not match the seating allocations used to 
calculate the centre of gravity for each flight  
 the manual load sheet had no provision to re -calculate the centre of gravity  
 the Operations Ma nager was not involved in all relevant operational decisions.  
4.4.7  One of the auditors summarised the findings of the January 2012 audit in a routine weekly 
report to the Manager Flight Operations  Airlines , and recommended in that report that the air 
operator certificate for Great Barrier Airlines  be suspended because the airline could not show 
that it met the statutory requirements of a certificate holder.38  The auditor sent a copy of his 
weekly report to the General Manager Operations and Airwort hiness . 
4.4.8  The auditors ' draft audit report included more than a p age of explanation for their belie f that  
the airline did not meet the statutory requirements .  Although  the draft report did not explicit ly 
recommend  suspension of th e air operator certificate , it included the following statement:  
'Upon reviewing the audit, the auditors are satisfied that based on the evidence 
gathered, Great Barrier Airlines fail to meet any of the requirements of Section 
12(4) of the Civil Aviation Act 1990.'  
4.4.9  The General Manager consider ed the draft audit report and decided th at th e recommended 
action  would be disproportionate under the circumstances .  The approved  final audit report 
did not refer to  the auditors' concerns , but did describe an airline with a new management  
                                                        
38 As shown  in the  Civil Aviation Act 1990, section 12(4).

 Final Report 11 -006 team that did not understand fully its responsibilities, did not have an accurate knowledge of 
the risks associated with its operations or how they were being performed, and did not act 
promptly to correct identified deficiencies.   The report concluded by  noting  that the CAA had 
discussed the deficiencies with the new management team and "reached agreement on how 
these problems can be addressed" . 
4.4.10  The CAA made 33 findings regarding the management and flight operations at Great Barrier 
Airlines during the 3 audits conducted between October 2010 and February  2012.39  Although 
the findings were mostly minor and of an administrative nature, taken together they gave an 
impression of successive airline management teams having been unable to make and sustain 
the imp rovements that the CAA required.  The CAA recognised that the airline's failure to  meet 
internal quality assurance requirements was a core issue.  
4.4.11  The recurring findings of administrative lapses and operational deficiencies confirmed that the 
airline's corrective actions had been ineffective, or in some cases, had not existed.  The CAA 
had recognised this in May 2012 when it wrote  to the Chief Execut ive of Great Barrier Airlines 
and stated that the delay in closing the findings from the September 2011 spot check was 
unacceptable.  The letter also noted that some findings from a January 2011 audit had still 
not been resolved, and indicated that the air line "does not have the systems in place to 
effectively implement corrective action".  
4.4.12  However, the pattern  of CAA responses was one of issuing similar corrective actions for 
repeated findings of the same nature.  While the auditors might have found the roo t causes of 
many of the airline's earlier management and compliance problems, the agreed corrective 
actions had generally been ineffective and had not compelled the airline to meet the regulated 
safety standards.   In the meantime, any recurring cases of non-compliance and deficiencies 
would likely mean that the airline operate d on occasions outside the Civil Aviation Rules.  
4.4.13  The CAA 's safety policy  recognised that a key requirement for air safety was to ensure  
operators had the attitudes and behaviours tha t reflected acceptance of their responsibility 
and accountability for actively identifying and effectively managing risks.  In the CAA's view, 
participants could be placed  somewhere  on the following  "safety performance continuum ": 
 willingly performing  to, or exceeding, the required safety standards  
 not performing but willing  
 wilfully not performing . 
4.4.14  The CAA had a range of  intervention strategies available for managing unsatisfactory 
performance by participants.  Anyone judged to be "wilfully not performing" , which was a very 
rare situation, risked having their document (certificate or licence) revoked or suspended .  A 
situation where an operator was "not performing but willing" could be complex for the Director 
to decide, especially if the operato r was continually unable to "make the grade" .  The 
repetitive  issuing of finding notices against Great Barrier Air lines for non -compliances of a 
generic nature had indicat ed that the airline was in this performance category  at that time , 
and that had  led the January 2012 auditors to recommend a stronger intervention .   
4.4.15  For a t least 3 years before the Pauanui incident , the CAA  had had evidence that the 
management and standard of operations at Great Barrier Airlines were not fully me eting civil 
aviation rule requirements .  The CAA had grounds to increase the level of regulatory 
intervention  to mitigate or eliminate the risk that substandard airline operations then pose d to 
the travelling public . 
4.4.16  One effect of the continued substandard airl ine performance ha d been that some cases of 
non-conformance appear ed to have been tolerated  and to some extent normalised by the 
airline and its pilots .  The pilots have a personal legal responsibility to conduct flights  safely , 
but the airline's culture at the time may have discouraged them from challenging and 
correcting obvious deficiencies.  
                                                        
39 For clarity, a  table  of selected  audits and the number of findings made is shown in Appendix 4 . 
  
Final Report 11 -006 
<< Page 21 >>
 4.4.17  The airline's failure to authorise and supervise the Pauanui charter flight properly was a 
deficiency foretold by the CAA spot check  only 5 weeks beforehand.  It wa s therefore likely to 
have been a latent factor in the causation of the runway excursion.  More generally, the wide 
range of cases of non-compliance and deficiencies identified in the preceding 3 years 
indicated an airline safety culture that likely contri buted to the incident.  Had the CAA enforced 
prompt and effective action by the airline to correct previous audit findings, or taken more 
forceful action against the airline, the incident might not have occurred.  
4.4.18  Unreasonable delays and ineffective attemp ts at corrective actions by air operators prolong 
the risk that those deficiencies become  latent factors in the causation of future incidents.  The 
Commission is recommending to the Director that he apply stricter requirements upon holders 
of air operator certificates so that prompt and effective action s are  taken to correct identified 
deficiencies . 
Finding : 
10. The CAA should have taken more decisive action to address the serious safety 
concerns identified in consecutive audits.  Had it done so, and required Great Barrier 
Airlines to take prompt and effective action to correct audit findings, the Pauanui 
incident might not have occurred . 
 
After February 2012  
4.4.19  Prior to about February 2012, each CAA audit report had included an " audit analysis" section, 
which expanded on the factual section of  the audit  report .  The analysis section s of some 
earlier reports on Great Barrier Airlines contained discussion s on management and 
operational practices, which had not necessarily resulted in audit findings.  However, since 
February 2012 the CAA has omitted the audit analysis section. As a resul t, the views of 
auditors and any relevant discussion s have not been recorded in later reports.   The CAA said 
this was done to align New Zealand practice with that of the European Aviation Safety 
Authority.  
4.4.20  After February 2012 the number and severity of fin dings made by the CAA during audits of 
Great Barrier Airlines declined progressively.  The airline submitted that the CAA  had 
responded positively to the airline's management changes, which were proving effective, and 
provided constructive advice to assist  it to meet its regulatory obligations.  
4.4.21  The airline was next audited in August 2012.  The auditors made 10 findings  in the area of 
management and general operations , one  of which  was considered "major".   Two of the minor 
findings described inadequate aspec ts of the airline's emergency response plan, which had  
also been discussed at the January 2012 audit, although no finding had been  made then.  
4.4.22  In May 2013 an audit was conducted of the airline's training functions.  The scope of that 
audit was decided on th e basis of a "Surveillance Risk Assessment" that had been  conducted 
in February 2013.  That assessment had considered "only those areas … identified as being 
medium -to-high risk", but was almost identical to one conducted in July 2012 prior to an audit 
of management functions.  Whereas  the July 2012 assessment had determined that the 
airline 's risk level was "high" , the February 2013 assessment was "low".   
4.4.23  The May 2013 audit made 6 findings, of which 2 were major:  
 the airline's pilot authorisations did not  identify all individual operational restrictions  
 the Operations Manager had operated a flight after the expiry date of the relevant 
qualification.  
4.4.24  By July 2013, the performance and compliance of Great  Barrier Airlines had improved and its 
new management t eam successfully completed a full re-certification  audit .

 Final Report 11 -006 5. Findings  
5.1. The primary reason for the aeroplane 's failure to take off was that its centre of gravity was well 
forward of the maximum permissible limit.  
5.2. Neither the pilot nor Great Barrier Airlines  had calculated the actual weight and balance of the 
aeroplane prior to the flight.  
5.3. Great Barrier Airlines had not provided the portable scales that were necessary for the pilot to 
compl y with the airline's procedure s for determining the aeroplane weight a nd balance.  
5.4. There were 3 factors that contributed to the aeroplane overrunning the end of the runway 
when the pilot aborted the take -off: 
 the aeroplane was too heavy for the available length of the Pauanui runway and the 
safety margin required by Civil Avi ation Rules  
 the pilot did not use all of the available runway  
 the pilot did not use the appropriate technique for a successful take -off. 
5.5. The Trislander aeroplane exceeded the equivalent single wheel load  for the Pauanui runway.  
The possibility could not be excluded that the sandy subsoil  increased the ro lling resistance on 
the wheels , which would have  degraded the take -off acceleration . 
5.6. Great Barrier Airlines had not considered whether its aeroplanes complied with the equivalent 
single wheel load at the a erodromes it used.  An excessive equivalent single wheel load could 
affect take -off performance and damage runway surfaces . 
5.7. The aerodrome operator did not know the origin of the published maximum equivalent single 
wheel load values and had not determined t he effect of subsurface  irrigation on the runway 
strength.  Incorrect or unknown equivalent single wheel load  data could affect the safety of 
aerodrome operations by reducing the take -off performance of aeroplanes using the runway . 
5.8. Systemic deficiencies wi thin the management of the Great Barrier Airlines operation 
contributed to the aeroplane overrunning the runway at Pauanui.  These deficiencies included:  
 the pilot check and training programme did not ensure that all pilots were appropriately 
qualified to operate into all aerodromes shown in the airline's exposition  
 there was uncertainty around the allocation of responsibilities between  senior 
managers and pilots in the airline  
 internal audits had failed to identify frequent non -compliance with the airline' s standard 
operating procedures.  
5.9. A culture of acceptance of non -conforming practices existed within the Great Barrier Airline s 
operation, in spite of external audits in the 3 years preceding the Pauanui incident having 
indicated that this was a safety issu e. 
5.10.  The C AA should have taken more decisive action to address the serious safety concerns 
identified in consecutive audits.  Had it done so, and required Great Barrier Airlines to take 
prompt and effective action to correct audit findings, the Pauanui incident might not have 
occurred .

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that might  otherwise have result ed in the 
Commission issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would normally have been unlikely to result  in a recommendation.  
  Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. (a) In November 2011 Great Barrier Airlines  advised the CAA that it had restrict ed 
 Trislander o perations to paved runways only . 
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.3 None  identified .

 Final Report 11 -006 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Director of Civil Aviation  and 
to the Chief Executive of the Thames -Coromandel District Council . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendati ons are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation  1 
7.3. The Pauanui runway excursion drew attention to recurring deficiencies in the operations at 
Great Barrier Airlines that had been previously identified by CAA audits.  For various reasons, 
corrective actions had been ineffective, with the result that some of  these deficiencies 
contributed to  the runway excursion at Pauanui .  A delay in correct ing identified deficiencies 
could be a latent factor contributing to  future incidents.  
7.4. Some of those audits also discussed serious safety issues with the manage ment  oversight 
and general culture  of the company , but not all of these issues result ed in audit findings . 
7.5. On 26 February 2014  the Commission recommend ed to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
apply strict er requirements upon holders of air operator certificates  to take  effective action to 
correct identified deficiencies , and that any serious safety issues that are identified with 
managerial oversight of airline  operations always result in findings . (001/14 ) 
On 5 March 2014, the CAA replied in part:  
The Director accepts the Commission's recommendation and advises that 
effective action has already been taken to implement its intent.  In this respect, it 
is noteworthy that the focus of the Commission's investigation primarily related 
to events in late 2 011 and early 2013.  Since that time the CAA has undergone 
considerable organizational change: a real focus of which has been to 
supplement its strong aviation technical expertise with an enhanced regulatory 
skill set.  To this end it has recently invested  considerable time and effort in 
articulating and strengthening its regulatory approach.  This work started to take 
effect at about the same time as the Pauanui Beach runway overrun occurred 
and has subsequently both gained impetus and been consolidated.  Examples of 
this investment include:  
 significant changes to the CAA's existing Surveillance Policy made in Sep 
2011.  Relevant to the second element of the Commission Recommendation, 
the following direction was introduced regarding the raising of findings:  
"When a document holder's performance falls below the required standard a 
finding will be raised "; 
 new 'CAA Use of Regulatory Tools' policy introduced on 23 Sep 2011.  The 
new policy was created to provide guidance to CAA staff about the use of 
regulatory tools in discharging their obligations;  
 new 'Regulatory Operating Model' adopted and promulgated by th e CAA on 
17 Feb 2012.  The new policy was created to sit above the 'CAA Use of 
Regulatory Tools" policy and identify, at a high level, the overarching 
regulatory principles and approach the CAA adopts in discharging its 
obligations;  
 [A consultant]  has been  engaged to up skill regulatory staff on good 
regulatory practice and operational risk management (workshops held May 
2013 and Feb 2014).  All senior regulatory staff, and the majority of all 
regulatory staff, have attended one of these seminars;  
  
Final Report 11 -006 
<< Page 25 >>
  the addit ion of Operational Risk Management and Safety Management 
System skills to the competency framework for regulatory staff.  Development 
and the delivery of such training with the latest element of the training 
delivery commencing March 2012;  
 internal review processes for regulatory functions ensure compliance with 
proper process and identify learnings that can drive improvement;  
 review of the current risk profile 'triggers' for targeting oversight of any 
operator with action underway to move toward targeting of the upper quartile 
of the risk profile distribution (as opposed to utilizing fixed trigger 'scores' for 
this purpose); and  
 the introduction of a risk -based approach to regulation that focusses 
attention on the circumstances of a particular case, the ris ks posed and the 
selection of the most appropriate regulatory intervention to provide the 
required risk mitigation.  
The efforts outlined above constitute  a significant strengthening and sharpening 
of the CAA's regulatory focus in the time since the overrun  at Pauanui.  While 
incremental improvement is always possible the CAA has invested considerably 
in providing its staff with the direction, guidance, skills and tools necessary for 
them to make sound, evidence -based decisions in the public interest.  
Recomm endation 2  
7.6. The weight of the Trislander that overran the Pauanui aerodrome runway on 22 October 2011 
greatly exceeded the published maximum ESWL  for the runway.  The possibility that the 
aeroplane's wheels s ank into the runway surface and affect ed its take -off performance could 
not be excluded . The aerodrome operator did not know the origin of the published values of 
ESWL  nor what effect s wastewater discharges under the runway had on the runway bearing 
strength.  
7.7. On 26 February 2014  the Commission recommend ed to the Chief Executive  of the Thames -
Coromandel District Council that the council  establish accurate values for the ESWL s at the 
aerodromes it operates and that it determine whether the "wet" ESWL is appropriate at the 
Pauanui aerodrome while a wastewate r discharge is underway and for any period after th e 
discharge  has ended . (002/14 ) 
On 12 March 2014, the Thames Coromandel District Council advised the Commission that 
they:  
…have engaged [consultants] to undertake the necessary investigation to enable 
Council to establish the required Equivalent Single Wheel Load.  
The results of the assessment and the follow up information will be forwarded to 
the Commission once completed. Unfortunately at this stage I am unable to 
provide the Commission with a da te by which the assessment will  be complete. 
The results of the ESWL assessment will be published as required.

 Final Report 11 -006 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Pilots must know the weight and balance of their aircraft before every flight and ensure that 
both remain within permissible limits.  Failure to do so can have serious consequences for 
flight safety . 
8.2. When calculating the weight and balance of their aircraft, pilots should use a standard weight 
for passengers only if it is truly representative of the actual passenger weights for the fligh ts. 
8.3. It takes more than just good written policies and procedures to achieve an acceptable level of 
flight safety.  Managers need to lead by example and ensure that pilots actually follow the 
procedures.

 Appendix 2: Certification and regulated performance requirements of 
Trislander aeroplanes.  
The basis for the New Zealand certificate was type certificate number BA6 issued by the United 
Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.  In 2002, the CAA of New Zealand found that the  United Kingdom 
certification provided an equivalent level of safety to that of certification in the Normal Category of 
United States Federal Aviation Rule 23, which is the basic certification standard against which  the CAA 
assesses light aircraft.  The Un ited States also certificated the Trislander against Federal Aviation Rule 
135 Appendix A.  
Air transport operations using the Trislander were conducted under Part 125 of the Civil Aviation 
Rules.40  Part 125 sub -part D prescribed the performance requirement s and limitations, but contained 
an anomaly for aeroplanes - like the Trislander - that were certificated in the Normal Category of 
United States Federal Aviation Rule Part 23 and Federal Aviation Rule 135 Appendix A.  
A section of Part 125 sub -part D did n ot apply to aeroplanes certificated against Federal Aviation Rule 
Part 23 Normal Category, and another section did not apply to aeroplanes certificated against Federal 
Aviation Rule 135 Appendix A.  Taken together, these exemptions removed many of the requ irements 
for scheduled take -off (and landing) performance data for the Trislander.  The CAA advised that the 
anomaly arose from changes to United States rules since the Trislander was first certificated in the 
United Kingdom.  
The CAA said that the Trisland er should be operated under Civil Aviation Rules 125.209 to 125.225.
