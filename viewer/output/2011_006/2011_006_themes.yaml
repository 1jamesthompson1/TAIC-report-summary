- name: Weight and Balance Management
  explanation: Weight and balance management is a critical aspect of flight safety, ensuring that an aircraft is loaded within its permissible limits for safe operation. In the Pauanui incident, the primary reason for the aircraft's failure to take off was that its "centre of gravity was well forward of the maximum permissible limit" (5.1). The pilot and Great Barrier Airlines had not calculated the actual weight and balance of the airplane prior to the flight (5.2), and the airline had not provided the necessary portable scales for the pilot to comply with the airline's procedures for determining the airplane weight and balance (5.3). This theme is relevant to the accident as improper weight and balance management directly impacted the aircraft's take-off performance, contributing to the runway excursion.
- name: Pilot Training and Supervision
  explanation: Adequate pilot training and supervision are essential to ensure that flight operations are conducted safely and in accordance with established procedures. In this incident, systemic deficiencies within the management of Great Barrier Airlines' operation, including the pilot check and training program, contributed to the accident (5.8). The pilot did not adequately plan for the flight, had a low understanding of scheduled performance, and did not comply with some of Great Barrier Airlines' policies and procedures (4.3.2). These deficiencies indicate that the pilot training and supervision were below the required standard, which is a safety theme relevant to the accident as it highlights the lack of preparedness and oversight that could prevent such incidents.
- name: Regulatory Oversight
  explanation: Regulatory oversight is intended to ensure that aviation operators adhere to safety standards and correct any deficiencies in a timely manner. In the case of Great Barrier Airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had recurring concerns for the management and standard of operations at the airline during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions taken to address those concerns had been largely ineffective (4.4). The CAA should have taken more decisive action to address the serious safety concerns identified in consecutive audits (5.10). This theme is relevant to the accident as it underscores the role of regulatory bodies in enforcing safety standards and the potential consequences when oversight is not sufficiently rigorous or effective.
- name: Aircraft Performance Understanding
  explanation: Understanding aircraft performance is crucial for pilots to make informed decisions about the feasibility of flight operations under various conditions. In the Pauanui incident, the pilot did not fully understand the variables of airplane performance, as evidenced by her expectation that the take-off performance at Pauanui would be similar to what she was used to at North Shore, despite the different runway conditions (4.2.16). This lack of understanding is a safety theme relevant to the accident because it contributed to the pilot's decision to attempt take-off under conditions where the aircraft was too heavy for the runway and the safety margin required by Civil Aviation Rules (5.4).
- name: Aerodrome Suitability and Performance Assessment
  explanation: Ensuring the suitability of an aerodrome for the specific aircraft and flight operation is a key safety consideration. In this incident, the aeroplane exceeded the equivalent single wheel load for the Pauanui runway (5.5), and the aerodrome operator did not know the origin of the published maximum equivalent single wheel load values nor had it determined the effects of subsurface irrigation on the runway strength (5.7). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of assessing aerodrome conditions and aircraft compatibility, which in this case, were factors that could have affected the safety of aerodrome operations by reducing the take-off performance of the aircraft using the runway.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  explanation: An organization's safety culture influences the behavior and decision-making of its employees, including adherence to safety procedures and reporting of safety concerns. The Pauanui incident revealed a culture of acceptance of non-conforming practices within Great Barrier Airlines (5.9), and internal audits had failed to identify frequent non-compliance with the airline's standard operating procedures (5.8). This safety theme is relevant to the accident as it reflects the broader organizational environment that allowed safety deficiencies to persist, ultimately contributing to the occurrence of the incident.
