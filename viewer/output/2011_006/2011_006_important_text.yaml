  \  Runway excursions are recognised globally as  a major risk to aviation safety\
  \ .  The outcome of \nan excursion depends on variables such as the aeroplane size\
  \  and speed , and whether it \nencounters obstacles when it leaves the runway.\
  \  \n4.1.2  The Pauanui incident occurred after the pilot rejected  the take -off\
  \ because of concern for the \naeroplane 's take-off performance.  The aeroplane\
  \ was slow to accelerate  and the pilot was \nunable to raise the nose of the ai\
  \ rcraft off the runway to take  off.  As she doubted that the \naeroplane would\
  \ fly, rejecting the take -off was an appropriate action . \n4.1.3  The Commission\
  \ has concluded that the aeroplane had no chance of a successful take -off due \n\
  to a combination of issues with th e aeroplane 's weight and balance  and possibly\
  \ the surface \ncondition of the runway.  An improper take -off technique was also\
  \ a factor contributing to the \noverrun.  These issues are first discussed , before\
  \ considering the following general safety \nissues  that were identified in the\
  \ inquiry : \n\uF0B7 the standard of pilot training and supervision of operation\
  \ s at Great Barrier Airlines \nwas below that required   \n\uF0B7 the CAA had had\
  \ recurring concerns for the management and standard of operations \nat Great Barrier\
  \ Airlines during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions taken \nto\
  \ address those concerns had been largely ineffective  \n\uF0B7 the council had\
  \ not evaluated the effect s of the subsurface  runway irrigation system \non the\
  \ maximum ESWL for the Pauanui runway . \n4.2 The dir ect causes of the Pauanui\
  \ runway excursion  \n4.2.1  The weather conditions were not a factor .  The aeroplane\
  \ take-off configuration was correct \nand there was no evidence  that any aeroplane\
  \ technical factor  contributed to the incident.  \n4.2.2  The degraded performance\
  \ was due to  the following factors , which are discussed in turn:  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ aeroplane weight and balance  were not as planned  \n\uF0B7 the take -off distance\
  \ available  was insufficient  \n\uF0B7 the pilot's take -off technique was inappropriate\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the aeroplane was too heavy for the runway surface.  \n4.2.3  The pilot\
  \ was completely unaware of these impediments to a safe take -off because she had\
  \ \nnot plan ned adequately for the flight.  She did not appreciate the actual weight\
  \ or calculate \nthe expected performance.  Great Barrier Airlines  contributed\
  \ to  the incident  through its \ninadequate supervision of operations.  \nThe aeroplane\
  \ weight and balance  \n4.2.4  A load sheet shows the amount and distribution of\
  \ the items that make up the total weight of \nan aircraft.  A load sheet  must\
  \ be completed for every flight to s how compliance with weight \nand balance  limits\
  \ , including that the centre of gravity will remain within the limits during the\
  \ \nflight.17  Adherence to the flight manual centre of gravity limits is critical\
  \ for safe flight.  \n4.2.5  The aeroplane's elevators control th e pitch  attitude\
  \ of the aeroplane.  They are a fixed \ndistance behind the main landing wheels.\
  \  When the pilot pulls back on the controls to take  off \n(rotates), the elevators\
  \ are attempting to raise the nose of the aeroplane  by pivoting the \naeroplane\
  \ on its  main wheels.  If the aeroplane's centre of gravity is too far forward\
  \ ( \"nose \nheavy \") it will be more difficult to raise the nose .  This was the\
  \ primary reason for the \n                                                    \
  \    \n17 Civil Aviation Rules 125.305 and 125.307.  \n  \nFinal Report 11 -006\
  \ \n<< Page 11 >>\n unsuccessful take -off.  The pilot applied full aft elevator\
  \ in an attempt to rotate the aeroplane \nto the take -off attitude, but that control\
  \ input had no effect . \n4.2.6  The load sheet for the Pauanui flight is shown\
  \ in Appendix  1.  The passenger manifest section \nof the sheet  does not show\
  \ the names o f the passengers o r where they sat .  The pilot should \nhave directed\
  \ the passengers to seat s marked  as \"occupied \" in the pre-planned loading \n\
  arrangement  shown  at the bottom left corner of the sheet , and recorded their\
  \ names against \nthe appropr iate seat number s.  The load sheet  was partially\
  \ completed at the operator's base.  \nThe load sheet  showed that the aeroplane's\
  \ weight and balance were  within permissible \nlimits, but this assum ed that the\
  \ pilot would direct  passengers to the designated seats and \nthat the average\
  \ passenger weight was close to the standard weight of 81  kg.18  Neither was \n\
  the case  on this flight : the pilot allowed the passengers to sit where they chose\
  \  and the ir \naverage weight was later calculat ed to be 101  kg.  The pilot said\
  \ that she thought the \npassengers looked \"average \". \n4.2.7  The passengers\
  \ did not have any significant carry -on baggage.  Using the declared passenger\
  \ \nweights, the aeroplane weight before take -off was calculated to have been about\
  \ 4294 kg, \nwhich was 214 kg  over the pre -planned 4080 kg.  \n4.2.8  The total\
  \ aeroplane weight was less than the maximum permitted  weight, but the actual \n\
  weights and seating positions of the passengers put the aero plane centre of gravity\
  \ well \nforward of the allowable range .19  The allowable range for the Tri slander\
  \ centre of gravity \nposition was very  narrow compared with those of  other  aeroplanes\
  \ commonly used for air \ntransport  (see Appendix 3) . \n4.2.9  Later calculations\
  \ using the declared passenger weights showed that even if the seat plan had \n\
  been followed, the centre of gravity position would have been very dependent on\
  \ which \npassenger sat where and could still have been ahead of the forward limit.\
  \  Had t he Pauanui \npilot recognise d that actual passenger we ights  should have\
  \ been used, an acceptable \naeroplane weight and balance might have been achieved\
  \  for that flight . \n4.2.10  The load sheet had provision for change s to the\
  \ load weight, but not for calculating any \nresultant change in the centre of gravity\
  \ position.  Pilots were required to telephone the \nAuckland base for that revised\
  \ data , as the Matarangi pilot did.  This system might work most \nof the time,\
  \ but as pilot s are responsib le for ensuring that the weight and balance of their\
  \ \naeroplane s are within the allowable limits , it would have been prudent  for\
  \ the operator to \nprovide them  with a ready means to calculate it themselves\
  \ .  The operator later advised that it \nwould provide pilots with a manual weight\
  \ and balance form.  \n4.2.11  Great Barrier Airlines' procedures  provided for\
  \ situations when passengers did not appear to \nbe of \"standard \" weight by requiring\
  \ th at th eir actual weights be used .  The Operations Manual \nstated that scales\
  \ were to be taken in the aeroplane when passengers were to be boarded at \nan aerodrom\
  \ e without check -in scales , unless the passengers' weights had been notified\
  \ to \nthe company in advance .  In this case, t he passenger weights were not notified\
  \ in advance  \nand the airline did not have any portable scales for the pilot to\
  \ take  to Pauanui .20  Matarangi  \nwas another aerodrome without check -in scales,\
  \ yet the load sheet for the charter flight from \nthere on 20 October 2011 was\
  \ also prepared using standard weights.21  Therefore, the use of \nstandard weights\
  \ appeared to be  the airline's normal practice  for all load sheets .  The \noperator\
  \ later advised that it intended to use actual passenger weights on all future flights.\
  \  \n4.2.12  Although the operator  had documented weight and balance procedures\
  \ , in practice the y were \nnot all followed  by its pilots .  In both the  Pauanui\
  \ and Matarangi incidents , the pilots had not \nseated their passengers in accordance\
  \ with the planned loading arrangement s. \n                                   \
  \                     \n18 The standard weight did not include the weight of personal\
  \ carry -on baggage, which was weighed separately.  It came \nfrom a  survey of\
  \ passenger s' weights con ducted by the operator in January  2010  and was approved\
  \ by the CAA . \n19 The estimated position was 254 millimetres aft of the datum.\
  \  The forward limit was 500 millimetres aft of the datum  \n20 The operator's investigation\
  \ into the Pauanui incident s tated that scales had been purchased to correct this\
  \ deficiency.   \n21 See section 3.9 . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report 11 -006\
  \ Findings:  \n1. The primary reason for the aeroplane 's failure to take off was\
  \ that its centre of \ngravity was well forward of the maximum permissible limit\
  \ . \n2. Neither the pilot nor Great Barrier Airlines  had calculated the actual\
  \ weight and \nbalance of the aeroplane prior to the flight.  \n3. Great Barrier\
  \ Airlines  had not provided the portable scales that were necessary for \nthe pilot\
  \ to comp ly with the airline's procedure s for determining the aeroplane \nweight\
  \ and balance.  \n \nThe take -off distance available  and aeroplane handling technique\
  \  \n4.2.13  Aircraft flight manuals include chapters on \"scheduled performance\
  \ \" that contain the data \nneeded to determine the expected performance of the\
  \ aircraft under stated conditions  - for \nexample, the maximum weight for take\
  \ -off at a given altitude and air temperature; the \nmaximum altitude achievable\
  \ with a specified weight and temperature; and the take -off \ndistance required.\
  \   \n4.2.14  The flight manual charts or tables for calculating the take -off distance\
  \ required  include \ncorrections for different types of runway surface , typically\
  \  paved (asphalt or concrete) surfaces \nand firm, dry gra ss.22  On grass or soft\
  \ runways, such as Pauanui w ith its sand subsoil , the \nrolling resistance of\
  \ the tyres is higher, which increases the take -off ground run.  Long or wet \n\
  grass further increases the distance required, but the effect is too variable for\
  \ co rrection \nfactor s to be given.  \n4.2.15  The take -off speed of an aeroplane\
  \ is directly related to its gross weight.  In general, a heavy \naeroplane will\
  \ accelerate more slowly and must reach a higher speed than a lighter aeroplane\
  \ \nof the same type before it can take off.  The heavy aeroplane therefore needs\
  \ a longer ground \nrun. \n4.2.16  The pilot had operated Trislanders at weights\
  \ up to the maximum permitted for take -off, but \nonly from longer, paved runways\
  \  such as North Shore aerodrome .  Her expectation that the \ntake-off per formance\
  \ at Pauanui would be similar to what she was used to at North Shore \nindicated\
  \ that she did not fully  understand th e variables of aeroplane performance . \n\
  4.2.17  The flight manual stated that the take -off safety speed was the speed at\
  \ which the pilot should \nraise the nose to the take -off attitude.23  The speed\
  \ varied directly with the aeroplane weight, \nup to a maximum of 70 kts.  The take\
  \ -off safety speed for the planned take -off weight at \nPauanui was 67 kts, but\
  \ the pilot said she had been  aiming to rotate at  80 kts.  Her choice \nwas likely\
  \ influenced by an informal take -off safety speed used within the airline.  The\
  \ C EO \nsaid it used 80 kts for all weights and sometimes 90 kts when taking off\
  \ at Auckland.  The \nFlight Standards and Training Manager said that 90 kts would\
  \ be  unusual,  but a higher speed \nwas useful at Auckland when traffic was busy\
  \ because it gave a better climb rate and allowed \nan earlier turn after take -off.\
  \ \n4.2.18  The flight manual take -off performance data was based on all engines\
  \ operating at maximum \ncontinuous power (2700 revolutions per minute /full throttle),\
  \ the wing flaps set to 25 degrees \nand the aeroplane being \"held on the ground\
  \ until the appropriate take -off safety speed \".24  \nThese conditions implied\
  \ that, for ma ximum performance, the engines would be  set to \nmaximum power before\
  \ the brakes were released for the take -off run and the aeroplane nose \nwould\
  \ be rotated at 70 kts.  The Flight Standards and Trainin g Manager stated that\
  \ this was \n                                                        \n22 The take\
  \ -off distance required is t he distance to take  off and climb to 50 f eet. \n\

  \ \n  \nFinal Report 11 -006 \n<< Page 13 >>\n the method taught and one that the\
  \ pilot had performed competently on a check flight.  \nHowever, on the incident\
  \ flight she performed a rolling take -off. \n4.2.19  The assumed conditions for\
  \ calculating the expected aeroplane performanc e on take -off were \n1015 hectopascals,\
  \ 18 degrees Celsius and a head wind of 10 kts.  Using the se values, the \ntake-off\
  \ distance s required from a dry, paved  runway w ere determined to be a bout  620\
  \ m at \nthe planned weight and 680 m at the calculated weight.25  The flight manual\
  \ required these \ndistances to be increased by 15% when taking off from \"dry grass\
  \ runways with freshly cut \ngrass and firm subsoil \".26  With that correction,\
  \ the take -off distances required were \napproximately 713 m and 782 m respectively.\
  \   The actual length of the runway was 782 m, so \nthe aeroplane should have been\
  \ able to take off, provided no other factors degraded its \nperformance ( for example,\
  \ the runway condition or an improper centre of gravity position ). \n4.2.20  The\
  \ Great Barrier Airlines  standa rd operating procedures noted the Civil Aviation\
  \ Rule that the \ntake-off distance required for an air transport flight shall not\
  \ exceed 85% of the take -off run \navailable.27 That was 665 m in the case of the\
  \ 782 m long runway at Pauanui.  Therefore the \nPauanui runway was not long enough,\
  \ even at the originally planned take -off weight.   The CEO \nlater acknowledged\
  \ that he had not considered this Rule before telling the pilot th at Pauanui \n\
  would be acc eptable for the scenic flight . \n4.2.21  In the Matarangi incident,\
  \ the pilot did determine that the runway would be long enough.  \nHowever, his\
  \ calculation of 610 m for the take -off distance required was based on a firm,\
  \ dry \nrunway with short grass.  Although the flight manual did not provide any\
  \ corrections for wet or \nlong grass, a longer distance would have been required\
  \ because both factors were present.  \nTherefore it was very likely that the actual\
  \ take -off distance required would have exce eded \n655 m, which was the maximum\
  \ under the \"85% of distance available \" requirement.  \n4.2.22  The similarities\
  \ between the 2 rejected take -off incidents showed that the airline 's pilots,\
  \ \nincluding the CEO, did not have the required understanding of the Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules or the \nairline 's own policies and procedures in regard to aircraft performance.\
  \  This indicated \ninadequate training and supervision of operations within Great\
  \  Barrier Airlines . \n4.2.23  The flight manual noted that \"the take -off run\
  \ required will not exceed, and must be taken as, \n61% of the take -off distance\
  \ [required] \".  On that basis, the scheduled take -off run at the \nestimated\
  \ take -off weight was 477 m.  The actual g round run would have been longer \n\
  because the rolling take -off was commenced at  an inset position, rather than at\
  \ the runway \nend. \n4.2.24  Great Barrier Airlines ' Route Guide showed incorrectly\
  \ that the Pauanui runway was 850 m \nlong (rather than 782 m).  That error could\
  \ have been a factor in the CEO 's advising the pilot \nthat the runway would be\
  \ long enough.  No other runway distances were given in the Guide.  \nAlthough the\
  \ pilot did not refer to the Guide, an incorrect and partial list of runway data\
  \ could \nmislead pi lots if they used the Guide for determining performance.  For\
  \ example, the Guide did \nnot show that the take -off distance available (at that\
  \ time) on runway 05 was only 707 m.  The \nairline  later removed any data from\
  \ the Guide that was already provided in the AIP.  \n4.2.25  Aeroplane performance\
  \ was rarely a critical factor at the aerodromes in Great Barrier Airlines ' \n\
  scheduled route network, but it should have been an essential consideration f or\
  \ a non -\nscheduled flight to a rarely used aerodrome.  Assessing t he feasi bility\
  \ of a flight, which was no \ndoubt done when the charter flight request was received,\
  \ was no substitute for the assigned \npilot calculating the actual performance\
  \ using the weight and environmental conditions \npertaining on the day . \n   \
  \                                                     \n25 Trislander  Flight Manual,\
  \ p.5. 5/c.  The distance is from start of take -off until the aeroplane reaches\
  \ a height of 50 feet.  \n26 Civil Aviation Rule 125.211 specified an increase of\
  \ 14% for operations from grass, without specifying the condition .  \nThere was\
  \ no requir ement for the greater of this or any corresponding factor in the flight\
  \ manual to be observed.   \n27 Civil Aviation Rule 125.209(a)(2).  \n\n<< Page\
  \ 14 >>\n Final Report 11 -006 Finding : \n4. There were 3  factors that contributed\
  \ to the aeroplane overrunning the end of the \nrunway when the pilot ab andon ed\
  \ the take -off: \n\uF0B7 the aeroplane was too heavy for the available length of\
  \  the Pauanui runway and \nthe safety margin  required by Civil Aviation Rules\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the pilot did not use all of the available runway  \n\uF0B7 the pilot\
  \  did not use the appropriate  technique for a successful  take-off. \n \nThe runway\
  \ condition  \nSafety issue - The council had not evaluated the effect s of the\
  \ subsurface  runway irrigation \nsystem on the maximum equivalent single wheel\
  \ load  for the Pauanui runway . \n4.2.26  Reduced acceleration during a take -off\
  \ roll can result when the aeroplane is too heavy for the \nrunway surface and the\
  \ tyres \"sink\" into the surface.  Runways can be damaged if aeroplanes \nare operated\
  \ at weights above the design limit weight s for the runway s.  Civil Aviation Rule\
  \ \n125.77, Use of Aerodromes , required the holder of an air operator certificate\
  \ to ensure that \nthe aerodromes it used when performing air tr ansport operations\
  \ had physical characteristics \nappropriate to the aeroplanes being used, and that\
  \ the ru nways had sufficient strength.  \n4.2.27  The usual measure of the load\
  \ imposed by a small or medium aeroplane28 on a runway is the \nequivalent single\
  \ wheel load  (ESWL).  The ESWL is a simplified way of accounting for the \nactual\
  \ weight of the aeroplane and its landing gear configuration .  The ESWL for an\
  \ aeroplane \nwith one wheel per main landing gear leg is fixed at 45% of the actual\
  \ weight  of the \naeroplane .29  Multi -wheel configurations, such as the dual\
  \ main wheels of the Trislander, have \nlower ESWL s. \n4.2.28  The training syllabi\
  \ for the various pilot licences did not specify \"ESWL \" as a knowledge \nrequirement,\
  \ but the need was implied by the following syllabus items (in this  case, taken\
  \ from \nthe Commercial Pilot Licence syllabus):30 \n16.50.4 Describe the publications\
  \ and their content that provide operational \nroute and aerodrome information.\
  \  \n16.50.6 Derive operational information from charts and publications that provide\
  \ \nroute and aerodrome information.  \n16.76.10 Interpret information on aerodrome/heliport\
  \ charts , AIP GEN & AIP \nVolume 4.  \n4.2.29  The AIP referred aeroplane operators\
  \ to the CAA for advice on the ESWL s for specific \naeroplane types. The CAA advised\
  \ that the value for dual main wheels was 80% of that for \nsingle wheels; that\
  \ is, 36% of the actual aeroplane weight.31 \n4.2.30  The pilot in the Pauanui incident\
  \ said she did not know the Trislander 's maximum ESWL or \nhow to calculate it.\
  \  The flying school where she had completed her pilot training did cover the \n\
  subject of ESWL, but once a pilot moved to larger aeroplanes and airports there\
  \ might be few \noccasions when the information was important .  Therefore, the\
  \ knowled ge was soon forgotten.  \n4.2.31  It was incumbent upon operators to identify\
  \ and address knowledge and skill gaps applicable \nto their operations.  In this\
  \ case, Great Barrier Airlines  could not show that it had determined \nthe maximum\
  \ weights for each of its aeroplane types to ensure that aerodrome ESWL limits \n\
  \                                                        \n28 Which may be taken\
  \ to mean aeroplanes having a maximum certificated take -off weight less than 5700\
  \ kg.  \n29 AIP, p.AD 1.10 -2. All AIP references were current on 22 October 2011.\
  \  \n30 Advisory Circular 61 -5, Pilot Licences and Ratings - Commercial Pilot Licence.\
  \  \n31 The International Civil Aviation Organi zation Circular 25 -AN/22, Runway\
  \ design methods for multiple wheel landing \ngears , published in 1952 , advised\
  \ that  the ESWL for a dual main wheel configuration could be 30% of the actual\
  \ weight.  \n  \nFinal Report 11 -006 \n<< Page 15 >>\n were observed.   Following\
  \ this incident , Great Barrier Airlines advised the CAA that it would \nrestrict\
  \ Trislander operations to paved runways only.  \n4.2.32  The maximum ESWL for the\
  \ Pauanui runway was 1140 kg, or 910 kg in wet conditions .32  \nUsing the figure\
  \ of 36% of the aeroplane weight , the ESWL of the aeroplane on 22 October \n2011\
  \ was 1469 kg for the planned take -off and 1546 kg for the a ttempted take -off.\
  \  Both \nvalues exceeded the maximum ESWL for the Pauanui runway  when it was dry\
  \ . \n4.2.33  Similarly, with the previous incident at Matarang i aerodrome , the\
  \ runway ESWL limit was 910 \nkg, with no lower \"wet\" limit.  The calculated ESWL\
  \ for the first take-off attempt on 20 October \n2011 was 1452 kg and 1352 kg for\
  \ the actual take -off.  Again the aeroplane exceeded the \nESWL for th e runway.\
  \  \n4.2.34  The estimated take -off weights in both the Pauanui and Matarangi incidents\
  \ were less than \nthe maximum certificated t ake-off weight s for the aeroplane\
  \ s, but they excee ded the more \nrestrictive ESWL s. \n4.2.35  Comments from other\
  \ pilots who had operated light aircraft at Pauanui on 22 October 2011  \nsuggested\
  \ that the runway strength had not been affected significantly by recent rain or\
  \ \nwastewater  discharges .  However, t he Trislander was much heavier than the\
  \ other aeroplanes , \nwhich meant  that its wheels were more likely to have experienc\
  \ ed increased rolling resistance \nfrom the sandy subsoi l, thus affecting the\
  \ aeroplane's  acceler ation .  The wastewater volumes \ndischarged in the preceding\
  \ week were  more than twice the consented daily volumes .  \nHowever, testing had\
  \ shown that the rate of discharge would not cause surface saturation.   \nFurthermore,\
  \ the most recent wastewater  discharge had been  3 days before the incident  \n\
  4.2.36  The council did not know the origin of the published values of maximum ESWL\
  \ or what effect \nwastewater discharges would have on the runway bearing strength.\
  \  As the aerodrome \noperator , the council was responsible for the accuracy of\
  \ aerodrome information published in \nthe AIP.  Therefore, the council ought to\
  \ have establish ed accurate values for the ESWL \nincluding any reduced bearing\
  \ strength caused by wastewater discharges under the runway.   It \nalso needs to\
  \ be wary of mon itoring and maintaining the irrigation system.  As shown in this\
  \ \ncase, leaks in the irrigation system can affect the runway surface in that area.\
  \  \n4.2.37  The Commission is recommending to the council that it establish accurate\
  \ values for the \nESWL s at the aerodrome s it operates and that it determine whether\
  \ a \"wet\" ESWL is \nappropriate at the Pauanui aerodrome while a wastewater discharge\
  \ is underway and for any \nperiod after th e discharge has ended.  \n \nFindings:\
  \  \n5. The Trislander aeroplane exceeded the equivalent single wheel load  for\
  \ the Pauanui \nrunway .  The possibility could not be excluded that the sandy subsoil\
  \ increased the \nrolling resistance on the wheels, which would have degraded the\
  \ take -off \nacceleration . \n6. Great Barrier Airlines  had not considered whether\
  \ its aero planes complied with the \nequivalent single wheel load  at the aerodromes\
  \ it used.  An excessive equivalent \nsingle wheel load could affect take -off performance\
  \ and damage runway surface s. \n7. The aerodrome operator did not know the origin\
  \ of the published maximum \nequivalent single wheel load  values and had not determined\
  \ the effect s of \nsubsurface  irrigation on the runway strength.   Incorrect or\
  \ unknown equivalent single \nwheel load  data could affect the safety of aerodrome\
  \ operations by reducing the \ntake-off performance of a eroplanes  using the runway.\

  \  deficiencies  \nSafety issue: The standard of pilot training and the supervision\
  \ of operations at Great Barrier \nAirlines was below that required . \n4.3.1  The\
  \ Pauanui pilot had approximately 1500 flight hours as well as 9 months ' service\
  \ with Great \nBarrier Airlines.  That experience and the airline's training ought\
  \ to have ensured that she \ncould perform the flight safely, which was her responsibility\

  \ weight and balance data  \n\uF0B7 not complying with some of Great Barrier Airlines\
  \ ' policies and procedures.  \n4.3.3  The pilot did not recognise that the aeroplane\
  \ weight  and aerodrome conditions required her \nto conduct  a maximum -performance\
  \ take -off or that a successful take -off might be unlikely . \n4.3.4  The pilot\
  \ accepted the CEO's statement that the Pauanui runway would be suitable for the\
  \ \nplanned flight , and did not check the performance charts  for that reason .\
  \  The more \nexper ienced pilot-in-command of the aeroplane at Matarangi also accepted\
  \ old information \nabout that aerodrome from the CEO.  In each case, given that\
  \ the aerodrome was rarely used \nby Great Barrier A irline s, the pilot ought to\
  \ have obtained the current aerodrome  information \nand critically evaluated the\
  \ expected aeroplane performance before the flight.  Pilots-in-\ncommand have  individual\
  \ responsibilit ies to perform that planning33 and the a irline  has a \nresponsibility\
  \ to make the information readily available  to its pilots .34 \n4.3.5  The CEO\
  \ misled both pilots to some degree and overlooked a mandatory performance \nrequirement.\
  \  It is especially important, given their influence on the organisation's culture\
  \ and \nlevel of compliance, that senior persons in an airline have strong operational\
  \ knowledge and \ndemonstrate best practice  for more junior pilots in their employment\
  \ . \n4.3.6  When the same mistakes and errors are made by diff erent people who\
  \ work in an airline, it is \nan indicat ion of systemic deficienc ies.  The Great\
  \ Barrier A irlines  exposition included the \nrequired  policies  and procedures\
  \ .  Had all of its pilots been complying with its policies and \nprocedures, neither\
  \ this incident nor th at at  Matarangi should have occurred .  However, the \n\
  airline management had not ensured, pa rticularly in the case of the Pauanui flight,\
  \ that the \npilot, aeroplane and aerodrome were suitable for the flight.  \n4.3.7\
  \  After the Pauanui incident, Great Barrier Airlines  advised the CAA that it had\
  \ suspended flights \ninto Pauanui and \"other marginal airfields \" until it was\
  \ \"satisfied that the aircraft and crew \n[were] suitably qualified to conduct\
  \ such flights \".  The CEO said that the \"refresher\" training \nsession held\
  \ in early November 2011  in response to the 2 runway incidents emphasised \ncompliance\
  \ with standard operating procedures .  The operator later advised that it would\
  \ \nformalise periodic test ing of pilots' knowledge of standard operati ng procedures\
  \ .  \n4.3.8  A CAA spot check  in September 2011, 5 weeks before the Pauanui incident,\
  \ had asked the \noperations manager about the airline's documented procedure for\
  \ authorising charter flights \n\"to ensure that all new airfields are risk assessed\
  \ and only appropriately qualified pilots are \nassigned  [to the flight] \".  The\
  \ operator did not consider Pauanui to be a \"new\" a erodrome, \neven though  it\
  \ was rarely used .  Therefore,  the Operations Manager  had not been involved in\
  \ \nauthorising the Pauanui charter.  The airline said that, f ollowing  the Pauanui\
  \ and Matarangi \nincident s in 2011 , it had amended its policy to require  every\
  \  charter flight to be subjected to a \n                                      \

  \ 11 -006 \n<< Page 17 >>\n risk assessment prior to specific authorisation.   However,\
  \ the January 2012 audit issued a \nfinding notice because the airline had \"no\
  \ apparent process for the authorisation of non -\nscheduled flights\".   A proactive\
  \ operator  would have immediately heeded the earlier advice of \nauditors.  This\
  \ airline  did not react  promptly, even after a serious incident had occurred.\
  \  \n4.3.9  Following these 2 occurrences t he Flight Standards and Training Manager\
  \ reviewed the pilot \ntraining and  checking programme, for which he was responsible\
  \ .  He found no issues , yet the \noccurrences showed that there were safety issues\
  \ with the way the check and training \nprogramme was working .  The operator dealt\
  \ with the matter  by restricting future Trislander  \noperations to sealed runways\
  \ only.   While this action might have resolve d problems with how \nthe airline's\
  \ procedures deal t with flight authorisation and planning, it d id not resolve\
  \ the \nissue of a sub -standard check and training program me for its pilots. \
  \ \n4.3.10  Pauanui and Matarangi  were not on the airline 's normal route network\
  \ , but  were considered to \nbe included in the general route and aerodrome qualification\
  \ s of pilots.   In spite of that, the \nairline's report to the CAA on the incident\
  \ included  a finding that the pilot had not been \npreviously checked into Pauanui.\
  \  O n 27 October 2011 , without a route check and presumably \non the basis of\
  \ the incident flight, the CEO signed and added a Pauanui aerodrome \nqualification\
  \ to the pilot's training file.   The operator  later instituted an Aerodrome Assessment\
  \ \nform to be used in conjunction with flight authorisations for non -scheduled\
  \ flights.  \n4.3.11  The holder of an air operator certificate is required to ensure\
  \ that its pilots have the requisite \nknowledge, amongs t other things, of the\
  \ route and aerodromes to be used and the operator's \npolicies and procedures appropriate\
  \ to its air operations.35  The pilot at Pauanui (and, to a \nlesser extent , the\
  \ pilot at Matarangi ) demonstrated some knowledge and skill deficiencies  that\
  \ \nthe a irline  should have identif ied and corrected.  \n4.3.12  An effective\
  \ check and training system, along with an effective internal audit system, should\
  \ \nbe able to identify and close knowledge and skill gaps like those described.\
  \   \n4.3.13  An inspection of the load sheets for flights by other pilots found\
  \ that indicated seat allocations \nand loading arrangement s often did not correlate.\
  \  The operator later explained that seat \nallocations were only correct when used\
  \ in conjunction with actual pass enger weights.  While \nthese discrepancies  did\
  \ not prove that the earlier flights had been incorrectly loaded, the y did \nmean\
  \ there was no documented proof that those flights had operated within flight manual\
  \ \nlimits.  Great Barrier Airlines  later emphasised to its staff the need to seat\
  \ passengers \naccording to the prepared loading arrangements .   \n4.3.14  A similar\
  \ inaccuracy in form use was evident in the Pauanui load sheet incorrectly show\
  \ ing the \nroute as AA (Auckland) to GB (Great Barrier - Claris).  The manifest\
  \ f or the Matarangi charter \nflight had th e same  error.  Although these  might\
  \ seem to be minor  errors , internal audit s had \nevidently not identified them\
  \  and pilots evidently tolerated them .  Whether that response is an  \nindicator\
  \ of tolerance or c omplacency , the frequent errors of this sort showed that  Great\
  \ \nBarrier Airlines  did not en sure compliance with its published polic ies and\
  \ procedures . \n4.3.15  More serious was the airline's  informal adoption of a\
  \ \"standard \" take-off safety speed of 80 \nkts.  While th is typically did not\
  \ jeopardise flight safety , the practice could have an  adverse \noutcome, as happened\
  \ at Matarangi and Pauanui , if the conditions for its safe use were not \nfully\
  \ appreciated by pilots .  The airline later said it would formalise the procedure\
  \ for use \nwhere runway length allowed . \n4.3.16  Poor supervision of operations\
  \ was inevitable when there was confusion between \nmanagement roles and responsibilities.\
  \  That problem was identified in the routine audit of \nOctober 2010  and the spot\
  \ audit of September 2011 , and was  evident after the Pauanui \nincident when managers\
  \ could not agree who had approved the charter.  \n4.3.17  Great Barrier Airlines\
  \  initially assessed the Matarangi rejected take -off as an \"acceptable risk \"\
  .  \nAfter the Pauanui incident 2 days later, the CEO suspended flights into Pauanui,\
  \ but only \n                                                        \n35 Civil\
  \ Aviation Rule 125.557, Initial training for crew members.  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n\
  \ Final Report 11 -006 because he understood the runway condition was poor.  The\
  \ CEO was not responsible for \nsuspending operations.  The airline's  exposition\
  \ stated36: \nThe Operations Mana ger is the person responsible to restrict or suspend\
  \ \noperations if any condition exists that is a hazard to safe operations.  \n\
  4.3.18  According to the Operations Manual, the appropriate person to approve flights\
  \ was also the \nOperations Manager.  However, o n 31 Octo ber 2011 the airline\
  \  issued the following Notice to \nPilots, which was later incorporated into the\
  \ Operations Manual:  \nUntil further notice, all charter flights to/from non -certificated\
  \ airfields, or any \nother than Auckland, Great Barrier, North Shore, Whang arei,\
  \ Kaitaia are not to be \nquoted or commenced until approval from BOTH the [Quality\
  \ Assurance Manager \nand Flight Standards and Training Manager] is sought.  \n\
  4.3.19  The confusion of management roles was still present when the CAA audited\
  \ the airline in \nJanuary 20 12. \nFinding s: \n8. Systemic deficiencies within\
  \ the management of the Great Barrier Air lines  operation \ncontribut ed to the\
  \ aeroplane overrunning the runway at Pauanui.  These deficiencies \nincluded: \
  \ \n\uF0B7 the pilot check and training program me did not ensure that all pilots\
  \ were \nappropriately qualified to operate into all aerodromes shown in the airline's\
  \  \nexposition  \n\uF0B7 there was uncertainty around the allocation of responsibilities\
  \ between  senior \nmanagers and pilots in the airline  \n\uF0B7 internal audits\
  \ had failed to identify frequent non -compliance with the airline's  \nstandard\
  \ operating procedures.  \n9. A culture of acceptance of non -conforming practices\
  \ existed within the Great Barrier \nAirline s operation, in spite of external audits\
  \ in the 3 years preceding  the Pauanui \nincident having indicat ed that th is\
  \ was a safety issue.  \n4.4 Regulatory oversight  \nSafety issue: The CAA had had\
  \ recurring concerns for the management and standard of \noperations at Great Barrier\
  \ Airlines during the 3 years prior to this incident, but the actions \ntaken to\
  \ address those concerns had been ineffective . \nPrior to February 2012  \n4.4.1\
  \  The standard of management and flight operations in Great Barrier Airlines had\
  \ concerned the \nCAA for more than 3 years prior to the Pauanui incident, but the\
  \ necessary improvements had \nnot been forthcoming.  Audit reports had identified\
  \ various, sometimes repeated, deficiencies \nin the airline's exposition, policies\
  \ , procedures.  \n4.4.2  In June 2008 Great Barrier Airlines had been  due for\
  \ a scheduled 5 -yearly re -certification  ('re-\nentry ').37  During preliminary\
  \ meetings with the airline , a CAA flight operations inspector had \nformed the\
  \ view th at there was \"a serious lack of day -to-day management\" within the airline.\
  \  \nOther major deficiencies had been  identified with the airline's compliance\
  \ with quality \nassurance requirements and its exposition generally.  \n      \
  \                                                  \n36 Great Barrier Airlines'\
  \ exposition, p aragr aph 3.1.16.  \n37 Initial certification and r e-entry involved\
  \ check s that the document holder's exposition complied fully with all relevant\
  \ \nlegislated requirements.  Subsequent audits primarily checked that the document\
  \ holder  was acting in  compliance with \ntheir  exposition.  \n  \nFinal Report\
  \ 11 -006 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.4.3  As a result of those observations, the CAA had\
  \ immediately investigated the airline under \nsection  15A of the Civil Aviation\
  \ Act 1990.  The specific safety concerns stated by the CAA \nwere that : \n\uF0B7\
  \ the internal quality assurance programme was ineffective  \n\uF0B7 the airline's\
  \ policy condoned the non -reporti ng of in -service aeroplane defects  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the airline management (at that time) did not provide adequate supervision and\
  \  direction.  \nThe CAA  required the airline to complete corrective actions before\
  \ it renew ed the air operator \ncertificate  in July 2008  (for 6 months  only).\
  \ \n4.4.4  One corrective action had been  to restructure the airline's senior management.\
  \  The CAA had \ninterviewed the operations manager in July 2008 prior to confirming\
  \ acceptance of his \nnomination for that role.  At that time the CAA noted the\
  \ manage r's aviation experience and \napparent strong safety focus, and his commitment\
  \ to an efficient quality assurance system.  \nHowever, the CAA's expectation of\
  \ a turnaround in the conduct of the airline was not fulfilled .  \nSubsequent audits\
  \ continued to make findings on management issues and quality assurance.  \n4.4.5\
  \  Due to t he recurring  management issues at the airline the CAA categorise d\
  \ the airline as \"high \nrisk\".  The means used by the CAA to try to force change\
  \ and improvement at the airline were  \nto issu e the ai r operator certificate\
  \ for a short term  only,  and to conduct more frequent routine \naudits and spot\
  \ checks . \n4.4.6  In late January 2012 the CAA conducted a routine audit  of the\
  \ management and general \noperations at the airline .  At that stage the new management\
  \ tea m had been in place for less \nthan a month.   Prior to the audit, the CAA\
  \ had identified some Route Guide and exposition \ndeficiencies that were pertinent\
  \ to the Pauanui incident.  The audit made 22 finding s, with \nsome similar to\
  \ those made in  the September 2 011 spot check .  They includ ed the following:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the lack of a process for authorising non -scheduled flights  \n\uF0B7\
  \ management reviews were held less frequently than was stipulated in the exposition\
  \  \n\uF0B7 there was no published procedure for risk assessment and no system \
  \ for aircraft \ndocument amendment  \n\uF0B7 the load sheet passenger manifests\
  \ did not match the seating allocations used to \ncalculate the centre of gravity\
  \ for each flight  \n\uF0B7 the manual load sheet had no provision to re -calculate\
  \ the centre of gravity  \n\uF0B7 the Operations Ma nager was not involved in all\
  \ relevant operational decisions.  \n4.4.7  One of the auditors summarised the findings\
  \ of the January 2012 audit in a routine weekly \nreport to the Manager Flight Operations\
  \  Airlines , and recommended in that report that the air \noperator certificate\
  \ for Great Barrier Airlines  be suspended because the airline could not show \n\
  that it met the statutory requirements of a certificate holder.38  The auditor sent\
  \ a copy of his \nweekly report to the General Manager Operations and Airwort hiness\
  \ . \n4.4.8  The auditors ' draft audit report included more than a p age of explanation\
  \ for their belie f that  \nthe airline did not meet the statutory requirements\
  \ .  Although  the draft report did not explicit ly \nrecommend  suspension of th\
  \ e air operator certificate , it included the following statement:  \n'Upon reviewing\
  \ the audit, the auditors are satisfied that based on the evidence \ngathered, Great\
  \ Barrier Airlines fail to meet any of the requirements of Section \n12(4) of the\
  \ Civil Aviation Act 1990.'  \n4.4.9  The General Manager consider ed the draft\
  \ audit report and decided th at th e recommended \naction  would be disproportionate\
  \ under the circumstances .  The approved  final audit report \ndid not refer to\
  \  the auditors' concerns , but did describe an airline with a new management  \n\
  \                                                        \n38 As shown  in the \
  \ Civil Aviation Act 1990, section 12(4).  \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report 11 -006\
  \ team that did not understand fully its responsibilities, did not have an accurate\
  \ knowledge of \nthe risks associated with its operations or how they were being\
  \ performed, and did not act \npromptly to correct identified deficiencies.   The\
  \ report concluded by  noting  that the CAA had \ndiscussed the deficiencies with\
  \ the new management team and \"reached agreement on how \nthese problems can be\
  \ addressed\" . \n4.4.10  The CAA made 33 findings regarding the management and\
  \ flight operations at Great Barrier \nAirlines during the 3 audits conducted between\
  \ October 2010 and February  2012.39  Although \nthe findings were mostly minor\
  \ and of an administrative nature, taken together they gave an \nimpression of successive\
  \ airline management teams having been unable to make and sustain \nthe imp rovements\
  \ that the CAA required.  The CAA recognised that the airline's failure to  meet\
  \ \ninternal quality assurance requirements was a core issue.  \n4.4.11  The recurring\
  \ findings of administrative lapses and operational deficiencies confirmed that\
  \ the \nairline's corrective actions had been ineffective, or in some cases, had\
  \ not existed.  The CAA \nhad recognised this in May 2012 when it wrote  to the\
  \ Chief Execut ive of Great Barrier Airlines \nand stated that the delay in closing\
  \ the findings from the September 2011 spot check was \nunacceptable.  The letter\
  \ also noted that some findings from a January 2011 audit had still \nnot been resolved,\
  \ and indicated that the air line \"does not have the systems in place to \neffectively\
  \ implement corrective action\".  \n4.4.12  However, the pattern  of CAA responses\
  \ was one of issuing similar corrective actions for \nrepeated findings of the same\
  \ nature.  While the auditors might have found the roo t causes of \nmany of the\
  \ airline's earlier management and compliance problems, the agreed corrective \n\
  actions had generally been ineffective and had not compelled the airline to meet\
  \ the regulated \nsafety standards.   In the meantime, any recurring cases of non-compliance\
  \ and deficiencies \nwould likely mean that the airline operate d on occasions outside\
  \ the Civil Aviation Rules.  \n4.4.13  The CAA 's safety policy  recognised that\
  \ a key requirement for air safety was to ensure  \noperators had the attitudes\
  \ and behaviours tha t reflected acceptance of their responsibility \nand accountability\
  \ for actively identifying and effectively managing risks.  In the CAA's view, \n\
  participants could be placed  somewhere  on the following  \"safety performance\
  \ continuum \": \n\uF0B7 willingly performing  to, or exceeding, the required safety\
  \ standards  \n\uF0B7 not performing but willing  \n\uF0B7 wilfully not performing\
  \ . \n4.4.14  The CAA had a range of  intervention strategies available for managing\
  \ unsatisfactory \nperformance by participants.  Anyone judged to be \"wilfully\
  \ not performing\" , which was a very \nrare situation, risked having their document\
  \ (certificate or licence) revoked or suspended .  A \nsituation where an operator\
  \ was \"not performing but willing\" could be complex for the Director \nto decide,\
  \ especially if the operato r was continually unable to \"make the grade\" .  The\
  \ \nrepetitive  issuing of finding notices against Great Barrier Air lines for non\
  \ -compliances of a \ngeneric nature had indicat ed that the airline was in this\
  \ performance category  at that time , \nand that had  led the January 2012 auditors\
  \ to recommend a stronger intervention .   \n4.4.15  For a t least 3 years before\
  \ the Pauanui incident , the CAA  had had evidence that the \nmanagement and standard\
  \ of operations at Great Barrier Airlines were not fully me eting civil \naviation\
  \ rule requirements .  The CAA had grounds to increase the level of regulatory \n\
  intervention  to mitigate or eliminate the risk that substandard airline operations\
  \ then pose d to \nthe travelling public . \n4.4.16  One effect of the continued\
  \ substandard airl ine performance ha d been that some cases of \nnon-conformance\
  \ appear ed to have been tolerated  and to some extent normalised by the \nairline\
  \ and its pilots .  The pilots have a personal legal responsibility to conduct flights\
  \  safely , \nbut the airline's culture at the time may have discouraged them from\
  \ challenging and \ncorrecting obvious deficiencies.  \n                       \
  \                                 \n39 For clarity, a  table  of selected  audits\
  \ and the number of findings made is shown in Appendix 4 . \n  \nFinal Report 11\
  \ -006 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.4.17  The airline's failure to authorise and supervise\
  \ the Pauanui charter flight properly was a \ndeficiency foretold by the CAA spot\
  \ check  only 5 weeks beforehand.  It wa s therefore likely to \nhave been a latent\
  \ factor in the causation of the runway excursion.  More generally, the wide \n\
  range of cases of non-compliance and deficiencies identified in the preceding 3\
  \ years \nindicated an airline safety culture that likely contri buted to the incident.\
  \  Had the CAA enforced \nprompt and effective action by the airline to correct\
  \ previous audit findings, or taken more \nforceful action against the airline,\
  \ the incident might not have occurred.  \n4.4.18  Unreasonable delays and ineffective\
  \ attemp ts at corrective actions by air operators prolong \nthe risk that those\
  \ deficiencies become  latent factors in the causation of future incidents.  The\
  \ \nCommission is recommending to the Director that he apply stricter requirements\
  \ upon holders \nof air operator certificates so that prompt and effective action\
  \ s are  taken to correct identified \ndeficiencies . \nFinding : \n10. The CAA\
  \ should have taken more decisive action to address the serious safety \nconcerns\
  \ identified in consecutive audits.  Had it done so, and required Great Barrier\
  \ \nAirlines to take prompt and effective action to correct audit findings, the\
  \ Pauanui \nincident might not have occurred . \n \nAfter February 2012  \n4.4.19\
  \  Prior to about February 2012, each CAA audit report had included an \" audit\
  \ analysis\" section, \nwhich expanded on the factual section of  the audit  report\
  \ .  The analysis section s of some \nearlier reports on Great Barrier Airlines\
  \ contained discussion s on management and \noperational practices, which had not\
  \ necessarily resulted in audit findings.  However, since \nFebruary 2012 the CAA\
  \ has omitted the audit analysis section. As a resul t, the views of \nauditors\
  \ and any relevant discussion s have not been recorded in later reports.   The CAA\
  \ said \nthis was done to align New Zealand practice with that of the European Aviation\
  \ Safety \nAuthority.  \n4.4.20  After February 2012 the number and severity of\
  \ fin dings made by the CAA during audits of \nGreat Barrier Airlines declined progressively.\
  \  The airline submitted that the CAA  had \nresponded positively to the airline's\
  \ management changes, which were proving effective, and \nprovided constructive\
  \ advice to assist  it to meet its regulatory obligations.  \n4.4.21  The airline\
  \ was next audited in August 2012.  The auditors made 10 findings  in the area of\
  \ \nmanagement and general operations , one  of which  was considered \"major\"\
  .   Two of the minor \nfindings described inadequate aspec ts of the airline's emergency\
  \ response plan, which had  \nalso been discussed at the January 2012 audit, although\
  \ no finding had been  made then.  \n4.4.22  In May 2013 an audit was conducted\
  \ of the airline's training functions.  The scope of that \naudit was decided on\
  \ th e basis of a \"Surveillance Risk Assessment\" that had been  conducted \nin\
  \ February 2013.  That assessment had considered \"only those areas \u2026 identified\
  \ as being \nmedium -to-high risk\", but was almost identical to one conducted in\
  \ July 2012 prior to an audit \nof management functions.  Whereas  the July 2012\
  \ assessment had determined that the \nairline 's risk level was \"high\" , the\
  \ February 2013 assessment was \"low\".   \n4.4.23  The May 2013 audit made 6 findings,\
  \ of which 2 were major:  \n\uF0B7 the airline's pilot authorisations did not  identify\
  \ all individual operational restrictions  \n\uF0B7 the Operations Manager had operated\
  \ a flight after the expiry date of the relevant \nqualification.  \n4.4.24  By\
  \ July 2013, the performance and compliance of Great  Barrier Airlines had improved\
  \ and its \nnew management t eam successfully completed a full re-certification\
  \  audit . \n  \n\n<< Page 22 >>"
