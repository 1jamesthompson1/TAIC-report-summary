- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The master did not discuss the plan with other bridge team members, assuming entering Tory Channel was routine, which indicates a lack of shared situational awareness ("the master did not discuss the plan with the other bridge team members" (4.3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Additionally, the helmsman was not fully aware of the vessel's position or the master's intentions, which contributed to the wrong-way helm error ("The helmsman later said that he thought the ship was still approaching the channel entrance" (4.3.8)).
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not indicate that the bridge team was engaged in non-essential activities or distractions that contributed to the accident.

    '
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The grounding occurred due to a deviation from the planned passage because of a wrong-way helm error, which was not corrected in time ("The Monte Stello deviated from the passage plan because the rudder was put to starboard instead of to port" (5.3)). The error management system failed to prevent the accident despite the presence of procedures designed to prevent such errors ("The safety management system provided appropriate defences against the wrong-way helm error yet the Monte Stello still collided with the rock" (4.3.15)).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 15
  explanation: "The report indicates that the standard of bridge resource management on the Monte Stello was not as high as on other vessels operated under KiwiRail's safety management system, suggesting organizational influences on safety culture (\"The standard of bridge resource management on the Monte Stello leading up to the grounding was not as high as that found operating on the other three vessels operated under KiwiRail\u2019s safety management system\" (5.5))."
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The accident was significantly influenced by a breakdown in bridge team performance and communication, including the failure to use closed-loop communication consistently ("The error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team" (5.4)).
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not discuss the bridge team''s training and preparedness for emergency procedures as a contributing factor to the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report explicitly states that there was no evidence of failure of any engineering or navigation systems, which suggests that maintenance procedures and compliance were not a contributing factor ("There is no evidence that failure of any engineering or navigation systems contributed to the accident" (5.1)).
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The accident did not involve a fire, so fire detection and suppression systems are not relevant to the grounding of the Monte Stello.

- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report indicates that the safety management system failed to ensure the safety of the vessel, and there were questions about the level of bridge resource management training given to the bridge teams ("The safety management system failed to ensure the safety of the vessel" (4.3.15), "they also both raised questions about the level of BRM training given to the bridge teams" (4.4.7)).
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence that the design or specifications of the vessel's equipment contributed to the accident ("There is no evidence that failure of any engineering or navigation systems contributed to the accident" (5.1)).
