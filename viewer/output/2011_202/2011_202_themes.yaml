- name: Bridge Resource Management (BRM)
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that refers to the effective use of all available resources, including people, procedures, and equipment, to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel. It is relevant to this accident because the report indicates that the Monte Stello's deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance, which is a key aspect of BRM ("the monte stello collided with the rock because it deviated from the planned passage. there was, however, evidence that the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Furthermore, the report states that the error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team ("The error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team" (5.4)).
- name: Shared Mental Model
  explanation: A shared mental model is a safety theme that involves the members of a team sharing the same understanding of the operation to be performed and the teamwork involved. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report highlights that the lack of a shared mental model among the bridge team members contributed to the accident. The report notes that if a team member deviates from what is expected, then other team members will notice, challenge, and correct the error, which did not happen in this case ("An underlying principle of eradicating error within teams is the concept of a shared mental model" (4.2.7)). The master did not discuss the plan with other bridge team members, assuming familiarity with the routine maneuver, which led to a lack of shared understanding and contributed to the accident ("He did not discuss the plan with the other bridge team members, as he thought that entering Tory Channel was a routine manoeuvre which he expected the other bridge team members would be familiar with" (4.3.3)).
- name: Closed Loop Communication
  explanation: Closed loop communication is a safety theme that ensures clear and confirmed communication within the bridge team. It is relevant to this accident because the report identifies that closed loop communication was not consistently used, which allowed for a critical error to go uncorrected. The report provides an example of how closed loop communication should work and notes that it was not used for one helm order, which led to the rudder being put the wrong way ("Closed loop communication was not used and hence the opportunity to correct the error was lost" (4.3.7)). The lack of closed loop communication was a contributing factor to the vessel's deviation from the planned passage and subsequent collision with the rock.
- name: Red Zone Vigilance
  explanation: Red Zone vigilance is a safety theme that involves heightened awareness and safety procedures during high-risk operations. This theme is relevant to the accident because the entrance to Tory Channel was recognized as a high-risk "Red Zone" area, yet the declaration of a Red Zone did not lead to the expected heightened level of vigilance from the crew ("The declaration of a Red Zone was intended to trigger a heightened level of crew vigilance and safety for operations" (4.2.11)). The report indicates that the Red Zone declaration had little effect on the actions of the bridge team other than increased manning level, which suggests that the intended safety benefits of the Red Zone were not realized during the accident voyage ("However, it appears to have had little effect on the actions of the bridge team other than the increased manning level" (4.3.12)).
- name: Pilot/Co-Pilot System
  explanation: The pilot/co-pilot system is a safety theme that involves clear roles and responsibilities for the bridge team, particularly during navigation and maneuvering. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report indicates that the pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes ("The pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was ordered to a location where he was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes" (4.3.13)). The master's failure to ensure that the co-pilot could monitor his actions contributed to the error in rudder direction not being detected and corrected in time to prevent the grounding.
- name: Safety Management System Auditing and Training
  explanation: Safety management system auditing and training is a safety theme that involves the regular review and improvement of safety practices, as well as ensuring that all crew members are adequately trained. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report discusses the importance of ongoing training and auditing to maintain effective BRM practices. It notes that not all bridge team members had received formal BRM training and that the master and third mate had not wholly embraced the concept, which affected the implementation of the safety management system ("Of the four bridge team members on board the Monte Stello, only the master and third mate had received formal BRM training" (4.4.2)). The report also highlights that the Monte Stello had not been fully integrated into KiwiRail's safety management system and that the crew's ad hoc makeup posed a risk ("Arguably the standard of navigation and BRM on the Monte Stello posed the biggest risk to KiwiRail" (4.4.9)).
