- name: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) Practices
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is a safety theme that encompasses the methodology and behavior covering all aspects of bridge operations, including the use of all available resources to prevent accidents. In the case of the Monte Stello, the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance, which is a key aspect of BRM ("the monte stello collided with the rock because it deviated from the planned passage. there was, however, evidence that the deviation from the planned passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). Furthermore, the error in rudder direction was not picked up in time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as BRM, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team ("The error in rudder direction was not picked up in sufficient time to prevent the grounding because the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource management, were not being strictly followed by the bridge team" (5.4)).
- name: Shared Mental Model
  explanation: A shared mental model is a concept where the members of a team share the same understanding of the operation to be performed and the teamwork involved. This theme is relevant to the accident because the bridge team did not have a shared mental model, which would have allowed them to notice, challenge, and correct the deviation from the expected actions ("An underlying principle of eradicating error within teams is the concept of a shared mental model" (4.2.7)). The lack of a shared mental model contributed to the accident as the bridge team did not engage effectively as a team, sharing the same understanding of where the ship was and what was planned next ("aside from what the helmsman thought, had the bridge team been more engaged as a team, sharing the same understanding of where the ship was and what was planned next, it is more likely the helmsman and/or lookout would have recognized that for the master to give a starboard helm order in that situation would be unusual" (4.3.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Closed Loop Communication
  explanation: Closed loop communication is a method of communication where an instruction is given, acknowledged, and then confirmed to ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the parties involved. This theme is relevant because the accident occurred partly due to the failure to use closed loop communication consistently, which allowed the error in rudder direction to go uncorrected ("Closed loop communication was not used and hence the opportunity to correct the error was lost" (4.3.7)). The importance of closed loop communication is emphasized in the Fleet Operating Procedures manual and its failure was a contributing factor to the accident ("The process they followed was a textbook example of closed loop communication as described in KiwiRail's Fleet Operating Procedures manual" (4.3.5)).
- name: Pilot/Co-Pilot System
  explanation: The pilot/co-pilot system is a procedural defense where one officer is responsible for executing maneuvers while another officer follows up on all maneuvers and navigation made by the pilot. This theme is relevant because the pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes, which contributed to the accident ("The pilot/co-pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co-pilot was ordered to a location where he was unable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes" (4.3.13)). The breakdown of this system meant that there was no cross-checking of the master's orders, which allowed the error to occur and go uncorrected.
- name: Safety Management System Audits
  explanation: Safety management system audits are evaluations of the practices and procedures in place to ensure safe operations. This theme is relevant because both internal and external audits had previously found that generally BRM practices were operating effectively, but they also raised questions about the level of BRM training given to the bridge teams, including for existing junior officers and for new crew ("Both internal and external audits found that generally BRM practices were operating effectively. However, they also both raised questions about the level of BRM training given to the bridge teams" (4.4.7)). The Monte Stello had not been fully integrated into KiwiRail's safety management system and was only on a short-term charter, which may have contributed to the ineffective implementation of BRM practices on the accident voyage ("Arguably the standard of navigation and BRM on the Monte Stello posed the biggest risk to KiwiRail" (4.4.9)).
- name: Crew Familiarity and Composition
  explanation: Crew familiarity and composition refer to the level of experience and the ability of the crew to work together effectively as a team. This theme is relevant because the accident voyage was the first time the bridge team had worked together to transit Tory Channel, and the helmsman had neither acted as helmsman on the Monte Stello nor through the entrance to Tory Channel before ("However, the accident voyage was the first time the bridge team had worked together to transit Tory Channel" (4.3.4)). The lack of familiarity among the crew members, especially in critical roles such as the helmsman, contributed to the breakdown in bridge team performance and the subsequent accident.
