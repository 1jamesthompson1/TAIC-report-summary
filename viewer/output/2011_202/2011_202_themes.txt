Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Breakdown in bridge team performance: The deviation from the planned passage was attributed to a breakdown in bridge team performance, indicating a lack of coordination and communication among the bridge team members.
2. Lack of adherence to bridge resource management (BRM) practices: The report highlights that the bridge team did not strictly follow the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, which are part of BRM practices.
3. Insufficient training and familiarity with BRM: The bridge team members on board the Monte Stello had varying levels of formal BRM training, and the crew composition was ad hoc, leading to a lower standard of bridge resource management compared to other vessels operated under KiwiRail's safety management system.
