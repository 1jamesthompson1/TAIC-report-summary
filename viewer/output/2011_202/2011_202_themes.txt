Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Breakdown in bridge team performance: The deviation from the planned passage was attributed to a breakdown in bridge team performance, indicating a lack of coordination and communication among the bridge team members.
2. Lack of adherence to bridge resource management (BRM) practices: The report highlights that the bridge team did not strictly follow the procedures for checking and cross-checking every action during critical phases of navigation, which is a key aspect of BRM.
3. Insufficient training and familiarity with BRM: The bridge team members on board the Monte Stello had varying levels of formal BRM training, and the crew composition was ad hoc, leading to a lack of familiarity and understanding of BRM practices. This indicates a need for better training and implementation of BRM across all crews.
