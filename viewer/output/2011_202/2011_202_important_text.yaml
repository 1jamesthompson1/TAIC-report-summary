  \  \n4.1.1.  The g rounding of a roll -on-roll-off passenger and freight vessel\
  \ is a serious accident with \npotentially high consequences.  If the Monte  Stello\
  \  had collided with the rock a few metres \nfurther into the turn then it could\
  \ have resulted in the hull being penetrate d. \n4.1.2.  The Monte Stello  collided\
  \ with the rock because it deviated from the planned passage.  There \nwas no evidence\
  \ of a failure of any engineering control or propulsion systems,  or of its \nnavigation\
  \ systems.  There was, however, evidence that the deviation fr om the planned \n\
  passage was due to a breakdown in bridge team performance.  \n4.1.3.  The following\
  \ analysis discusses the Monte Stello  and Kiwi Rail's safety management systems\
  \ \nand how, together, they were supposed to ensure procedures were in place to\
  \ minimise the \nopportunity of accidents such as this happening.  Section 4.2 describes\
  \ the concept of bridge \nresource management and how it was intended to work. \
  \ Section 4.3 describes what \nhappened on the bridge of the Monte Stello  that\
  \ caused the ship to collide with the  rock.  \nFinding  \n1. There is no evidence\
  \ that failure of any engineering or navigation systems \ncontributed to the accident.\
  \  \n4.2. Bridge resource management  \n4.2.1.  The safe navigation of a vessel\
  \ is dependent on the performance of the bridge team.  However, \nhuman error is\
  \ ubiquitous and inevitable, a fact noted by Professor James Reason9.  Professor\
  \ \nReason said, \" Error  management has two components: limiting the incidence\
  \ of dangerous \nerrors and  - since this will never be wholly effective  - creating\
  \ systems that are better able to \ntolerate the occurrence of errors and contain\
  \ their damaging effect s10.\"  That is to say , human \nerror will occur and so\
  \ a primar y driver in the vessel's safety management sy stem is to prevent \nand\
  \ correct any errors that are made .  \n4.2.2.  The Monte Stello 's safety management\
  \ system incorporated the practices of bridge r esource \nmanagement (BRM).  BRM\
  \ is the name given to an industry -recognised methodology and \nbehaviour covering\
  \ all aspects of bridge operations.  The key safety aspect of BRM is that it \n\
  uses al l available resources, including people, procedures and equipment, to provide\
  \ \nsafeguards against accidents of the \" one-person -error\"11 type.  \n4.2.3.\
  \  Three procedures manuals relevant to this incident were KiwiRail's Fleet Operating\
  \ \nProcedures, its Fleet Passage Pl an, and the Procedures Manual for Monte Stello\
  \ . \nFleet Operation Procedures  \n4.2.4.  The Fleet Operating Procedures manual\
  \ described the principles and procedures that should \nbe applied by all crew across\
  \ the KiwiRail Limited fleet.  Section 2 was titled \"Bridge Ope rating \nProcedures\"\
  \ and contains various subsections describing, for example, the \"Principles of\
  \ \nWatchkeeping\" and what the officer -of-the-watch must do.  A review of this\
  \ document did not \nidentify any issues that contributed to the grounding.  \n\
  Fleet Passage  Plan \n4.2.5.  The Fleet Passage Plan contained detailed passage\
  \ plans for the passages between \nWellington and Picton via Tory Channel.  The\
  \ passage plans described waypoint positions; \n                               \
  \                         \n9 Reason, J. (1990). Human Error. New York: Cambridge\
  \ University Press.  \n10 Reason, J.  (1997).  Managing the Risks of Organizational\
  \ A ccidents.  Aldershot: Ashgate.  \n11 A one -person -error is an error made by\
  \ one person.  \nFinal report MO -2011 -202 \n<< Page 9 >>\n courses; distances;\
  \ radio call requirements; chart excerpts showing the passage plan; \ncomments highlighting\
  \ any dangers or restrictions; and various other pertinent information.  A \nreview\
  \ of this document did not identify any issues that contributed to the grounding.\
  \  \nProcedures Manual for Monte Stello  \n4.2.6.  The Procedures Manual for Monte\
  \ S tello was effectively a catalogue of checklists specific to \nthe Monte Stello\
  \  that the crew must use for critical procedures.  For example, it included a \n\
  checklist named Tory Channel Eastern Entrance Inbound Approach (see the appendix),\
  \ which \nprompted the b ridge team to specific actions they must take on the approach\
  \ to Tory Channel.  \nA review of this document did not identify any issues that\
  \ contributed to the grounding.  \nShared mental model  \n4.2.7.  An underlying\
  \ principle of eradicating error within teams is the co ncept of a shared mental\
  \ \nmodel.  A shared mental model is a concept whereby the members of a team share\
  \ the same \nunderstanding of the operation to be performed and the teamwork involved.\
  \  Thus if a team \nmember deviates from what is expected, then other tea m members\
  \ will notice, challenge and \ncorrect the error.  \n4.2.8.  The concept of a shared\
  \ mental model across the bridge team is critical to bridge resource \nmanagement,\
  \ and is encapsulated within the Monte Stello 's safety management system.  An \n\
  example of this is br idge team briefings.  The Tory Channel Eastern Entrance Inbound\
  \ \nApproach checklist states: \"This checklist is intended to be completed jointly\
  \ by the [officer of \nthe watch], master and bridge team\u2026 .\"  The checklist\
  \ states that the entire bridge team must \nbe briefed at the same time on a number\
  \ of points including (but not limited to) \"traffic and \nweather, tidal flow at\
  \ entrance, sea state, hand steering engaged and checked, and confirm \nmaster or\
  \ officer -of-the-watch has [control of the vessel]\".  \nClosed loo p communication\
  \  \n4.2.9.  Another example of ensuring a shared mental model is with respect to\
  \ communication.  The \nFleet Operating Procedures manual says: \"Closed loop [communications]\
  \ shall always be used \nwhen communicating with or within the bridge.  For example\
  \ - between the pilot and \nhelmsman when altering to a new course\u2026:  \nPilot:\
  \    course zero two one  [the pilot states the new course to  \n     steer]  \n\
  Helmsman:   course zero two one  [the helmsman acknowledges the new \n     course\
  \ to steer]  \nPilot:    yes   [the pilot  completes the closed loop \n     and\
  \ confirms the helmsman's  \n     interpretation of what he said is  \n     correct]\"\
  \  \nRed Zone  \n4.2.10.  The Monte Stello 's safety management system provided\
  \ procedures for high risk operations, \nwhere the tolerance for error is low, and\
  \  the consequence of failure is high.  The entrance to \nTory Channel involved\
  \ strong currents, a tight turn to port (left), and limited room for the vessel\
  \ \nto manoeuvre.  The safety management system recognised this as high risk and\
  \ classified the \nentrance t o Tory Channel as a \"Red Zone\".  The passage plan\
  \ stated the \"Red Zone begins 10 \nminutes prior to entering Tory Channel Controlled\
  \ Navigation Zone\" and extended all the way \nto the berth at Picton.  One of the\
  \ prompts on the Tory Channel Eastern Entrance In bound \nApproach checklist was\
  \ to \"declare Red Zone\".  \n4.2.11.  The declaration of a Red Zone was intended\
  \ to trigger a heightened level of crew vigilance and \nsafety for operations. \
  \ The areas covered by Red Zones were defined within the Fleet Passage \nPlan, and\
  \ the Fl eet Operating Procedures manual described the required bridge procedures\
  \ \nwithin Red Zones.  For example, there was an increased manning level where the\
  \ master was \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report MO -2011 -202 required to be on the\
  \ bridge in addition to the officer -of-the-watch, the helmsman, and a \nlookout.\
  \  Also, a pilot/co -pilot system would always be in place while the vessel was\
  \ operating \nwithin a Red Zone.  The pilot/co -pilot system was described in the\
  \ Fleet Operating Procedures \nmanual.  \nPilot/Co -pilot system  \n4.2.12.  The\
  \ pilot was the officer who had the c ontrol of the vessel.  The pilot initia ted\
  \ all manoeuvres, \nensu red the co -pilot was well informed about planned actions,\
  \ and was responsible for the \nsuccessful execution of the passage plan.  In this\
  \ case, the master was the pilot.  \n4.2.13.  The co -pilot was an offi cer responsible\
  \ for \"following up all manoeuvres and navigation made \nby the pilot\", and also\
  \ \"[review] all actions taken by the pilot and keep himself aware of all \nplanned\
  \ actions in order to be able to take over their duties at any time\".  The co -pilot\
  \ wa s also \nresponsible for other duties including (but not limited to) communication\
  \ external to the bridge \nteam and monitoring the ship's position relative to the\
  \ plan. In this case, the third mate was \nthe co -pilot.  \n4.3. The Monte Stello\
  \ 's approach to Tory Channel  \n4.3.1.  The third mate was the officer -of-the-watch\
  \ as the Monte Stello  approached the entrance to \nTory Channel.  He called the\
  \ master to the bridge as planned.  When the master arrived on the \nbridge, the\
  \ other three crew members were already there.  At about 054 0 the third mate and\
  \ \nmaster completed the bridge control handover checklist and the Tory Channel\
  \ Eastern \nInbound Approach checklist in the presence of the other bridge team\
  \ members.  The bridge \nteam at that time was the master (as pilot), third mate\
  \ (as co -pilot), helmsman, and lookout.  \n4.3.2.  Once the master had control\
  \ of the vessel, he began monitoring its track against the leading \nlights, which\
  \ provided a lead for the vessel through the entrance and into Tory Channel.  He\
  \ \nturned the auto -pilot off and the helm sman began steering by hand to the master's\
  \ orders.  \n4.3.3.  The master planned for the Monte Stello  to pass through the\
  \ heads and then begin a \ncontrolled -radius -turn to port in accordance with the\
  \ passage plan.  Although the two required \nchecklists were used, ther e was no\
  \ significant discussion or briefing on the imminent entry to \nTory Channel.  He\
  \ did not discuss the plan with the other bridge team members, as he thought \n\
  that entering Tory Channel was a routine manoeuvre which he expected the other bridge\
  \ team \nmem bers would be familiar with.  The master did not think it necessary\
  \ for the helmsman to \nknow details of the plan, as his role was simply to execute\
  \ whatever helm order the master \ngave him.  Similarly the helmsman felt he did\
  \ not need to know, as he was foc used solely on \nfollowing the master's helm orders.\
  \   \n4.3.4.  However, the accident voyage was the first time the bridge team had\
  \ worked together to \ntransit Tory Channel.  Prior to the accident voyage, the\
  \ helmsman had neither acted as \nhelmsman on the Monte Stello , nor acted as helmsman\
  \ on any other vessel through the \nentrance to Tory Channel.  Neither the lookout\
  \ nor the helmsman had sailed with the master \nbefore.  This unfamiliarity should\
  \ not necessarily have been an issue  if good BRM practices \nwere being followe\
  \ d.  However, neither the master nor the helmsman had engaged with the \nprinciples\
  \ of good BRM: one questioning the other's need to know, and the other questioning\
  \ \nwhy he needed to know.  \nWrong -way helm  \n4.3.5.  When the Monte Stello \
  \ was abreast of West Head, the mas ter (acting as pilot) initiated the \ncontrolled\
  \ -radius -turn to port by speaking the helm order \"port 10\".  The helmsman repeated\
  \ \nthe order, which the master confirmed.  The process they followed was a textbook\
  \ example of \nclosed loop communication as describ ed in KiwiRail's Fleet Operating\
  \ Procedures manual.  \nThe third mate (who was co -pilot) monitored the rudder\
  \ indicator to ensure it went to port 10, \nand in doing so fulfilled his duty to\
  \ follow up on the master's intentions.  Through this process \nthere coul d be\
  \ no misunderstanding or practical mistake between what the master planned to \n\
  happen and what did happen.  The Monte Stello  began to turn to port.   \nFinal\
  \ report MO -2011 -202 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.3.6.  Due to the design of the bridge,\
  \ the master did not have a clear view out the side of the bridge \nand so he sent\
  \ the third mate out to the port bridge wing to watch for the light on Scraggy \n\
  Point.  From that position the co -pilot was not able to monitor the master's actions\
  \ and \noutcomes, and so from that time the pilot/co -pilot system ceased to have\
  \ effect.  An option \nopen to the master was to ask the lookout to look for the\
  \ Scraggy Point light.  The practical \noutcome was that henceforth no -one monitored\
  \ the master's orders, nor the rudder indicator, \nto ensure they were correct.\
  \  This included the master.  Dep ending on the circumstances, it is \ngood practice\
  \ for the pilot (the master in this case) to glance at the rudder indicator for\
  \ each \norder given to ensure it is moving to the expected position.  \n4.3.7.\
  \  The Monte Stello  was still to starboard of the planned track an d so the master\
  \ intended to \nincrease the rate -of-turn by increasing the rudder angle.  The\
  \ master said he ordered \"port \n15\", which the third mate said he heard as he\
  \ walked across the bridge to the port bridge \nwing, but both the helmsman and\
  \ lookout later said the master had ordered \"starboard 15\".  \nThe helmsman turned\
  \ the rudder to starboard.  He did not repeat the order nor did the master \nfollow\
  \ up to confirm his order was understood.  Closed loop communication was not used\
  \ and \nhence the opportunity to co rrect the error was lost.  Because the third\
  \ mate had gone to the \nbridge wing, no -one was monitoring the rudder indicator,\
  \ and so another opportunity to correct \nthe error was lost.  \n4.3.8.  The helmsman\
  \ later said that he thought the ship was still approaching the channel entrance\
  \ \nand that the master was aligning the vessel with the leading lights.  Therefore,\
  \ he did not think \nan order for starboard rudder was inappropriate.  Usual protocol\
  \ for deliberately changing the \nhelm order from port to starboard would be to\
  \ first order the rudder to amidships.  A fully \naware helmsman would ideally confirm\
  \ such a perceived order to place the helm directly from \na port setting to a starboard\
  \ setting.  Aside from what the helmsman thought, had the bridge \nteam been more\
  \ engaged as  a team, sharing the same understanding of where the ship was \nand\
  \ what was planned next, it is more likely the helmsman and/or lookout would have\
  \ \nrecognised that for the master to give a starboard helm order in that situation\
  \ would be \nunusual.  \n4.3.9.  The Monte S tello deviated further from the planned\
  \ turn to port due to the wrong -way helm12. \nAt that point the master did not\
  \ realise the rudder had gone the wrong way, and he thought \nthe problem was that\
  \ the angle of rudder to port was still insufficient.  He intende d to increase\
  \ \nthat angle further to port.  However, he misspoke and said \"starboard 20\"\
  .  He immediately \nrealised his mistake and corrected himself by saying \"midships\"\
  , and then \"hard a -port\".   \nSummary    \n4.3.10.  The safety management system\
  \ provided four proced ures that should have helped prevent the \nhelm being put\
  \ the wrong way:  \n\uF0B7 the pre -manoeuvre briefing for the bridge team  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the declaration of \"Red Zone\" to heighten the crew's awareness and vigilance\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the pilot/co -pilot system  \n\uF0B7 the closed loop communication.\
  \  \n4.3.11.  The pre-manoeuvre briefing (completion of the Tory Channel Eastern\
  \ Inbound Approach \nchecklist) did not include any discussion about the actual\
  \ planned passage, nor reminders \nabout responsibilities (for example pilot/co\
  \ -pilot), nor was \"Red Zone\" declared.  The  first two \npoints were not included\
  \ in the checklist.  However, they are an integral part of effective BRM \npractice.\
  \  The briefing did not result in a shared mental model across the bridge team.\
  \  \n                                                        \n12 The condition\
  \ whereby the  rudder is put in the opposite direction from what was expected, for\
  \ example \nwhere the officer of the watch ordered the rudder to port, but the rudder\
  \ was put to starboard.  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report MO -2011 -202 4.3.12.\
  \  The declaration of \"Red Zone\" was intended to provide a heig htened level of\
  \ vigilance. \nHowever, it appears to have had little effect on the actions of the\
  \ bridge team other than the \nincreased manning level.  \n4.3.13.  The pilot/co\
  \ -pilot system was rendered ineffective when the co -pilot was ordered to a location\
  \ \nwhere he was u nable to monitor the pilot's actions and outcomes and to some\
  \ extent there \nmight have been an overreliance on it, as evidenced by the master\
  \ not routinely checking that \nwhat he had asked for was actually happening.  \n\
  4.3.14.  Bridge team members later said that close d loop communication was not\
  \ always used, \nespecially in routine manoeuvres.  This was one explanation for\
  \ why it was used for one helm \norder and not the next.  \n4.3.15.  The safety\
  \ management system provided appropriate defences against the wrong -way helm \n\
  error yet the Monte Stello  still collided with the rock.  The reasons why the safety\
  \ management \nsystem failed to ensure the safety of the vessel are discussed in\
  \ the next section.  \nFindings  \n2. The Monte Stello  collided with the rock because\
  \ it deviated from the planned \npassage.  \n3. The Monte Stello  deviated from\
  \ the passage plan because the rudder was put \nto starboard instead of to port\
  \ at a critical time when the ship was making the \nleft-hand turn into Tory Channel.\
  \  \n4. The error in rudder direction was not picked up in suffici ent time to prevent\
  \ the \ngrounding because the procedures for checking and cross -checking every\
  \ \naction during critical phases of navigation, known as bridge resource \nmanagement,\
  \ were not being strictly followed by the bridge team.  \n4.4. Safety management\
  \ system  \n4.4.1.  BRM is founded on the principle of teamwork, where all team\
  \ members contribute to its \nsuccess.  It is the responsibility of all bridge team\
  \ members to implement the practices and \nbehaviours of BRM.  For an individual\
  \ to implement the practices and behaviou rs they must \nfirst understand them,\
  \ and so it follows that all bridge team members should be trained in \nthose practices\
  \ and behaviours.  \n4.4.2.  Of the four bridge team members on board the Monte\
  \ Stello , only the master and third mate \nhad received formal BRM traini ng. \
  \ Some of their actions and discussions following the \naccident indicated they\
  \ had not wholly embraced the concept.  The other two had picked up \nsome concepts\
  \ via exposure to it as a part of their roles on the bridge.  For example, they\
  \ \nunderstood what \" closed loop communication\" meant.  Thus the effective implementation\
  \ of \nthe safety management system was almost wholly reliant on the officers' explanation\
  \ and \nenforcement of the practices and behaviours of BRM, which clearly did not\
  \ happen in this \ncase.  This issue was compounded by the fact that this bridge\
  \ team had not sailed together \nbefore, and the helmsman was not a regular bridge\
  \ team member.  \n4.4.3.  The master has ultimate responsibility for ensuring high\
  \ standards of navigation and BRM are \nbeing achieved b y his or her bridge team.\
  \  Therefore, for BRM to be fully effective, the master \nmust lead by example and\
  \ drive the bridge team to conform to the practice.  \n4.4.4.  Safety management\
  \ systems for individual ships are linked to the safety management system \nfor\
  \ the ope rating company.  The BRM aspects of the safety management system as applied\
  \ on \nboard the other three vessels operated by KiwiRail were audited internally\
  \ by KiwiRail as part \nof its safety management system, and externally by Maritime\
  \ New Zealand as part of  its \nongoing process of continual improvement for Cook\
  \ Strait ferries.  \nFinal report MO -2011 -202 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.4.5.  KiwiRail\
  \ audited the BRM procedures of the three vessels in its fleet in December 2008.\
  \  The \nauditors travelled with the ships and observed the bridge team performance.\
  \  KiwiRail found \nthat bridge team briefing sessions across all three vessels\
  \ were carried out in a meaningful \nand positive manner.  On one vessel it found\
  \ that \"robust BRM procedures were observed to \nbe in use as routine procedure\"\
  , and on another it found that it was time ly to initiate another \nround of BRM\
  \ courses due to significant change of staff.  \n4.4.6.  In January 2010 Maritime\
  \ New Zealand auditors completed one round trip with each of the \nthree vessels\
  \ to assess the operation of the bridge team; the auditors then produced a B ridge\
  \ \nResource Management Assessment report.  The report found that generally the\
  \ masters and \nsenior officers \"were confident of their powers of discretion and\
  \ empowerment\".  In particular, \nbridge lookouts were \"well briefed in their\
  \ role and responsibilit ies\", and \"best practice closed \nloop bridge communication\
  \ was consistent at all times\".  However, the audit report also raised \na question\
  \ about how the skill and experience of the master and senior officers were passed\
  \ \non to junior officers.  In the report  the auditors \"wished\" that  bridge\
  \ resource management \ntraining be considered by KiwiRail for all deck officers\
  \ as a further process improvement.   \n4.4.7.  Both internal and external audits\
  \ found that generally BRM practices were operating \neffectively.  However, they\
  \ also both raised questions about the level of BRM training given to \nthe bridge\
  \ teams, including for existing junior officers and for new crew.  \n4.4.8.  The\
  \ safety management system as applied on board the Monte Stello  had not yet been\
  \ \naudited while in operatio n.  However, it is clear that, at least on the accident\
  \ voyage with this \nparticular crew, BRM was not implemented effectively.  \n4.4.9.\
  \  Arguably the standard of navigation and BRM on the Monte Stello  posed the biggest\
  \ risk to \nKiwiRail.  The ship had not been fully embedded into the KiwiRail safety\
  \ management system \nand was only on a short -term charter.  Additionally, the\
  \ make -up of the crew was ad hoc, \nmeaning bridge teams would not have the benefit\
  \ of familiarity in working with each other as \nthey did on the perman ent ships\
  \ in the fleet.  \n4.4.10.  This accident is a salient reminder that bridge resource\
  \ management is not something that \ncan be trained for once only on a fleet -wide\
  \ basis and then left to chance.  It must be a \nstandard operating procedure fully\
  \ understood and fo llowed by all crews,  and the safety \nmanagement system needs\
  \ to ensure that it remains that way as crews come and go from the \nfleet.  It\
  \ is equally important for all ships in the fleet, regardless of whether they are\
  \ there for \nthe short or long term.  The C ommission has recommended that the\
  \ chief executive of KiwiRail \nfuture -proof the bridge resource management policy\
  \ and procedures outlined in its safety \nmanagement system to ensure they remain\
  \ relevant and effective for all crews on all ships in \nthe fleet, all of the time.\
  \   \nFindings   \n5. The standard of bridge resource management on the Monte Stello\
  \  leading up \nto the grounding was not as high as that found operating on the\
  \ other three \nvessel s operated under KiwiRail's safety management system.  \n\
  6. The standards of  navigation and bridge resource management required by \nKiwiRail's\
  \ safety management system were not being achieved by the bridge \nteam that was\
  \ on board the Monte Stello  when the accident occurred.  \n \n \n  \n\n<< Page\
