  \ Bombay  was about 15 years old at the time of the grounding.  It was classed as\
  \ a \nmedium -risk vessel as  far as the Port State Control s ystem was concerned,\
  \ primarily because \nof the deficiencies attributed to the vessel , although  none\
  \ of those deficiencies was serious \nenough for it to be detain ed.  The safety\
  \ management system s for the operating company and \nthe vessel  were current,\
  \ and the vessel  was crewed in accordance with the international and \nnational\
  \ standards of the day.  \n4.1.2  Vessel s' machinery installations a nd their control\
  \ systems are complex, and regardless of how \nwell maintained they are there will\
  \ always remain the possibility that some part fail s for some \nreason.  Vessel\
  \ s like the Hanjin Bombay  are designed fundamentally for long sea voyages , \n\
  with only a  small percentage of their time spent manoeuvring around ports and enclosed\
  \ \nwaters.  Consequently they often have only one main propulsion engine , for\
  \ econom y.  Such \nvessel s rely  on harbour tugs to provide redundancy while assisting\
  \ them into and out of po rts.  \nHarbour pilots provide a link between the vessel\
  \ s and the tugs and other port services.  \n4.1.3  It is important that the safety\
  \ systems for a vessel  and for a port company  are aligned in their \nrecognition\
  \ of the risks involved when the vessel  enters and leav es the port or harbour\
  \ .  The \nrespective safety systems  must be robust  and communication between\
  \ vessel  and port needs  \nto be good  before a  pilotage passage  plan is agreed\
  \ .  This is  because every vessel  is different  \nand handles differently . \n\
  4.1.4  The following analysis discusses what caused the Hanjin Bombay 's main engine\
  \ to stop; the \ntechnical reasons why it ran aground; the robustness of the safety\
  \ system  for the port, \nparticularly regarding risk ; and communication issues\
  \ within the bridge team a nd between the \nbridge team and the engine room.  \n\
  4.2 Why the engine stopped  \n4.2.1  It is clear from the engine alarm data and\
  \ the observations of the chief engineer that the \nengine automatically slowed\
  \ down then automatically shut down due to rising cooling -water \ntemp erature.\
  \  The engine protection system automatically shut down the engine, as it was \n\
  designed to do in order to protect the engine from serious damage.  The reason for\
  \ the rising \ncooling -water temperature could not be conclusively established\
  \ because when the 3 -way \nvalve was later dismantled, it was found to be in good\
  \ condition.  \n4.2.2  Four possibilities have been considered.  The first is that\
  \ the temperature sensor may have \nbeen faulty, but this was unlikely because the\
  \ engineers observed the temperature steadi ly \nrising on the monitor in the engine\
  \ room.  It was not performing erratically.  \n4.2.3  The second possibility  was\
  \ that the 3 -way valve controller may not have been receiving the \nsignal from\
  \ the temperature sensor.  This too is unlikely because when the cooling w ater\
  \ \ntemperature increases the control system decreases the control air pressure\
  \ to the control \ndiaphragm, which would normally allow the spring to open the\
  \ valve to the coolers.  When the \nchief engineer removed the control air connection\
  \ from the valve th is should have overridden \nthe automatic control unit and allowed\
  \ the spring to open  the valve , but it didn't.  \n4.2.4  The third possibility\
  \  is that the spring that normally opened the valve was faulty, but it was \nfound\
  \ in good condition with no signs of corrosion.  \n4.2.5  The fourth possibility\
  \  is that the  valve stem became temporarily jammed with debris such as \ndetritus.\
  \  Evidence of detritus was not found jammed around the valve spindle, but detritus\
  \ \nwas found in the cooling water system (see figures A1 -2 and A1 -3).  The  chief\
  \ engineer \nsucceeded in starting to move the valve by hammering on the valve casing.\
  \  This would \nindicate that something was jamming the valve.  By the time the\
  \ valve was dismantled for \ninspection, it had been operating to cool the main\
  \ engine when it was used to re -float the  \nvessel , to take the vessel  out to\
  \ the anchorage and then to re-ente r the port again .  Any debris \nlodged around\
  \ the valve spindle would not necessarily  have  remain ed there , which could \n\
  \  \nReport 10 -204 \n<< Page 17 >>\n explain why the valve spindle was found in\
  \ a clean condition when the valve was dismantled \nfor inspection . \n4.2.6  The\
  \ Commission therefore considers that the most likely reason for the overheating\
  \ of the \ncooling -water system was a malfunction of the 3 -way valve, and that\
  \ the most likely reason for \nthis was that it could not operate due to debris\
  \ in the cooling water becoming lodged around \nthe valve spindle.  \n4.3 Loss of\
  \ control  \n4.3.1  The Hanjin Bombay  was heavily loaded with logs when it departed\
  \ No.10 berth.  A heavily \nladen vessel  is generally slower to respond to ch anges\
  \ in speed and direction  than an empty \nvessel .  It will take longer to gain\
  \ speed under engine power, and will take longer to slow down \nwhen engine power\
  \ is reduced.  Larger rudder angles will be needed to begin the vessel  \nturning,\
  \ and again when tryin g to slow or stop the rate of turn.  \n4.3.2  Once the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay  had been turned and lined up with the channel, the need for tug \nassistance\
  \ was reduced, provided the vessel  propulsion and steering systems remain ed \n\
  operative.   Vessel s with fine underwater lines  (container and passenger vessels)\
  \  will generally \nbe more directionally stable  than others .  Bulk carriers like\
  \ the Hanjin Bombay  are generally \nwider , with a more box -shaped underwater\
  \ profile.  These types of vessel  are not generally so \ndirectionally stabl e.\
  \  This means that more control is required to keep them  going in a straight \n\
  line. \n4.3.3  The rudder is aerofoil shaped.  When it is turned the water flowing\
  \ past it creates 'lift' on one \nside, like an aeroplane wing.  That lift pushes\
  \ the stern of the vessel  sideways and the stern \nrotates around the pivot point\
  \ , which  is near the bow of the vessel  when it is moving ahead.  In \nthis way\
  \ the vessel  is steered.  The faster the water flowing past the rudder, the more\
  \ lift is \nproduced and the better the vessel  steers.  The water flowing past\
  \ the rudder is governed by 2 \nthings: the speed of the vessel  through the water\
  \ ; and the additional flow created by the \npropeller.  At higher water  speed\
  \ s the speed of the vessel  through th e water plays a greater \nrole.  When a\
  \ vessel is accelerating the propeller wash has a greater effect until the speed\
  \ of \nthe vessel  builds  up.  Momentarily increasing engine speed will  therefore\
  \  give the pilot more \nsteering control.  Decreasing the engine speed will result\
  \ in less control for the pilot.  \n4.3.4  If the body of water through which the\
  \ vessel  is moving is also moving, the pilot will need to \ntake this into account,\
  \ particularly when navigating narrow channels.  The speed of the vessel  \nthrough\
  \ the water will need to be proportionally higher , otherwise the current can have\
  \ too \nmuch influence on the vessel 's path.  \n4.3.5  At the time of the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay 's departure the tide was still ebbing at 2 knots in the \nchannel, which\
  \ means the vessel  was running with a 2 -knot current.  In order for the pilot\
  \ to \nbetter control the planned  track of the vessel  as it entered the narrow\
  \ channel, he needed to \nhave a reasonably high water speed, and he was attempting\
  \ to achieve this by building up the \nspeed rapidly with the successive 'half'\
  \ then 'full' engine speed s. \n4.3.6  Figure 5 shows the progress of the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay  as the events unfolded.  When the chief \nengineer first noted that the\
  \ cooling -water temperature had risen above normal  (82\xB0C), the \ntugs were\
  \ still in attendance .  By the time the temperature had risen to 85 \xB0C the tugs\
  \ were \nreturning to their berth, less than half a nautical mile away.  A precautionary\
  \ phone call to the \nbridge at that time could have allowed the tugs to be back\
  \ in attendance .  It also  could have \ndelayed the 'full -ahead' engine movement\
  \ from th e bridge , which would have slowed the rise \nin cooling -water temperature\
  \  and given  the engineers more time to resolve the issue before \nthe engine shut\
  \ down.  \n4.3.7  As it was, the pilot was not told of the engine auto -slowdown\
  \ event and he went ahead and \ninitiated the turn into No. 2 Reach oblivious to\
  \ the fact that th e engine had slowed down.  He \nsoon noticed the unresponsiveness\
  \ of the vessel  to his helm orders and began questioning \nthe captain on why the\
  \ engine had slowed down.  The reason for the poor response t o the \nrudder movements\
  \ was the reduced propeller wash past the rudder.  Depending on the speed \nthrough\
  \ the water  that the vessel  had reached, it is feasible that the propeller at\
  \ 'dead-slow \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Report 10 -204 ahead ' revolutions was disrupting\
  \ the water flow past the rudder being created by the vessel 's \nspeed through\
  \ the water.  \n4.3.8  When the engine shut down altogether, the vessel  was still\
  \ turning to starboard.  Without any \npropeller wash past the rudder, there was\
  \ not enough lift generated by it to arrest the turn.  To \nexacerbate the situation,\
  \ once the bow began to leave the channel and out of the influence of \nthe following\
  \ curr ent, the current pushing on the stern of the vessel  would have accentuated\
  \ \nthe swing to starboard.  Without the engine or the use of tugs , the grounding\
  \ at that point was \nprobably inevitable.  \n4.3.9  There was a way that the use\
  \ of the main engine could have been prolonged.  The automatic \nslowdown  and subsequent\
  \ shutdown  of the main engine were  feature s of the engine safety \nsystem , designed\
  \ to prevent damage to the main engine from  overheating.  Both events could \n\
  have been overridden by the master on the bridge if the circumstances had permitted,\
  \ simply \nby pushing the override button on the engine control console.   This\
  \ button was flashing at the \ntime, which was a cue to the master that the override\
  \ function was available to him . \n4.3.10  An override feature is installed to\
  \ allow  the master to weigh  up his options to achieve  the least \nunfavourable\
  \ outcome  in such a situation .  Overrid ing an engine safety system could have\
  \ \ncaused overheating damage to the main engine, but overrid ing it for just long\
  \ enough to \nenable the pilot to steady the course of the vessel  in the channel\
  \ could have prevented the \ngrounding.   The tugs at that point were close to arriving\
  \ and could have been used to keep \ncontrol of the vessel  until the main engine\
  \ was available again.   With the 3 -way valve \nbeginning to function again, restoring\
  \ main engine power could have occurred very soon after \nit had been lost.  \n\
  4.3.11  It was unclear whether the master understood the function of the overrid\
  \ e button.  When the \nauto -slowdown alarm activated, he asked the chief engine\
  \ er on the phone whether he should \nreduce the engine speed.  This would suggest\
  \  that he was not aware that this was already \nhappening automatically.  Overrid\
  \ ing a safety system is not a decision to be taken lightly.  The \nmaster should\
  \ be fully conversant wi th the system and the ramifications of using it .  However,\
  \ \nthe consequences of a vessel  running aground can be serious.  Apart from the\
  \ disruption to \nservice and  the cost of repair, the potential for environmental\
  \ damage must be considered, as \nshould the disruption to port services.  \n4.3.12\
  \  Alternatively, h ad the entire bridge team been in the loop and an early assumption\
  \ been made \nthat no engine power was going to be availab le, it is possible that\
  \  the immediate deployment \nof both anchors would have alleviated the force of\
  \ the grounding, or even prevented it (but \nthat is purely speculation ). \n4.3.13\
  \  The short time it took for control of the Hanjin Bombay  to be lost highlights\
  \ the risk s of \nmechanical failure for port operations. It also highlights the\
  \ importance of good \ncommunication between all parties whose actions can affect\
  \ the progress of a vessel .  These \nmatters are discussed more fully in the following\
  \ sections.  \nFindings:  \nThe aut omatic main engine slowdown  and shutdown  events\
  \ were caused by high \ncooling -water temperature, which was most likely caused\
  \ by a malfunction of a 3 -way \nvalve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling\
  \ water.  \nThe Hanjin Bombay 's main engine automatical ly shut down after the\
  \ vessel  was \nestablished in a turn into No.2 Reach, which left the vessel  with\
  \ insufficient steering \ncontrol to overcome the momentum of the turn and prevent\
  \ it leaving the channel and \ngrounding.  \nThe facility was available both on\
  \ the bridge and in the engine control room to overrid e \nthe automatic main engine\
  \ shutdown , which might have resulted in damage to the \nmain engine but probably\
  \ would have prevented the vessel  running aground.  \n  \nReport 10 -204 \n<< Page\
  \ 19 >>\n  \nBetter communication about the developing situation within the bridge\
  \ team and \nbetween the bridge and engine room could have prevented the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay  \ngrounding through the better use of engines, tugs and anchors.  \n \n\

  \ \nReport 10 -204 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.4 Crew resource management  \n4.4.1  Crew\
  \ resource management is the term used to describe the co-ordination of all skills\
  \ and \nresources available to a vessel's crew to achieve the established goal of\
  \ optimum safety and \nefficiency1.   \n4.4.2  The use of crew resource management\
  \ helps  to eliminate the potential for one -person error s \nto result in an accident\
  \ , and it aids the flow of information between anyone whose actions can \naffect\
  \ the progress of the vessel .  This is not just limited to bridge personnel, but\
  \ includes the \nengine room and other deck crew, tugs and shore -based information\
  \ services .   \n4.4.3  When used effectively, crew resource management ensures\
  \ that all the vessel's crew : share a \ncommon view of the intended passage ; maintain\
  \ situational awareness ; anticipate dangerous \nsituations ; acquire all relevant\
  \ information and act upon it in a timely manner ; avoid an error \nchain being\
  \ formed ; and avoid preoccupation with minor proble ms. \n4.4.4  When crew resource\
  \ management is working effectively , the pilot join ing the vessel is \nincorporated\
  \ into the navigating bridge  team and an exchange of relevant information takes\
  \ \nplace .  This is usually in the form of a pre -departure briefing on the pilo\
  \ tage passage plan .  It is \nindustry best practice that t he entire bridge team\
  \ take part in this briefing so that they all \nunderstand the plan.  This did not\
  \ happen on the Hanjin Bombay .  The exchange was between \nthe master and pilot\
  \ only.  This fact was reflected in the performance of the bridge team as \nevents\
  \ unfolded.  The officer of the watch had virtually no involvement in managing the\
  \ \nsituation  as it escalated .  The master was acting alone, even to the exclusion\
  \ of involving the \npilot.  His discussions with the chief engineer were in Korean,\
  \ which no -one else on the bridge \nunderstood.   The pilot asked the master for\
  \ information several times, but did not get any \nresponse other than to be told\
  \ when one of the anchors had been let go just before the vessel  \nran aground.\
  \  \n4.4.5  Under the ISM Code the working language of the sh ip had been declared\
  \ as English.  The use \nof a common working language is critical to the safe operation\
  \ of a vessel .  This is especially \nimportant when dealing with emergencies. \
  \ On this occasion the master's discussions with the \nchief engineer being in the\
  \ Korean language meant that the pilot and other bridge team \nmembers could not\
  \ understand the problem they were dealing wi th.  This was then \nexacerbated by\
  \ the master's failure to then inform the bridge team what that problem was.   \n\
  4.4.6  Vessel s are totally reliant on the engineering systems for the safe transit\
  \ of enclosed waters.  \nIt is important that engine room crew are fully aware \
  \ of the situation during pilotage \noperations and vice versa, but so often this\
  \ does not happen.  Engine control rooms are \nusually located  down in the engine\
  \ room where the crew cannot see where the vessel  is and \nwhat is happening to\
  \ it .  Naturally the n, engine room crew can become 'immersed ' in their own \n\
  environment, focused solely on the performance of the machinery, and unaware of\
  \ the overall \nsituation . \n4.4.7  Fitting d uplicate chart plotter screens in\
  \ engine control rooms is one initiative that can help \nengine room crew maintain\
  \ awareness of the vessel 's location .  This knowledge can help \nengine room crew\
  \  to balance their response to resolve technical problems with the need to \ncommunicate\
  \ with the bridge.  Using this accident as an example, the c hief engineer was \n\
  aware that he had an escalating cooling -water problem.  He had 4 other engineers\
  \ at his \ndisposal , yet none was dedicated to bridge communications .  Had he\
  \ been aware, at a glance, \nwhere the vessel  was in the channel, he could have\
  \  surmise d that it was not a good time to \nhave main engine problems , warned\
  \ the bridge team early enough for them to alter  their plan , \nand prevented the\
  \ grounding.   There would even have been  some benefit in someone from \nthe engine\
  \ room taking part in the passage  plan briefing  on the bridge . \n4.4.8  Even\
  \ after the captain and chief engineer started conversing in the Korean language\
  \ on the \nphone, the master did not provide the pilot, who was controlling the\
  \ vessel , with sufficient \ninformation for him to respond accordingly.  \n   \
  \                                                     \n1  Captain Kari Larjo, Scandinavian\
  \ Airline Service (SAS) Flight Academy AB, 1993, SAS-BRM - Student's \nworkbook\
  \ - Edition 6.  \n \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Report 10 -204 4.4.9  The standard of crew\
  \ resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay  fell well short of \nbest industry\
  \ practice.  Crew resource management training is an important part of training\
  \ \nrequired under STCW 1995 .  This inquiry did not look as far back as  the training\
  \ standards for \nthe individual crew members involved in this accident, so it could\
  \ not be determined whether \nthe issue lay with just these individuals or whether\
  \ there is a wider systemic training issue.  \nHowever, the operating company does\
  \ hav e a responsibility to ensure that the vessel  is run \nsafely, which includes\
  \ ensuring that navigational practices and techniques as a minimum \ncomply with\
  \ the International Maritime Organization  and Flag State standards .  This is a\
  \ \nrequirement of any safety m anagement system .  The safe vessel  management\
  \ system  for the \noperating company and the Hanjin Bombay  clearly did not achieve\
  \ those standards on this \noccasion.  \nFindings:  \nThe standard of crew resource\
  \ management on board the Hanjin Bombay  fell well \nshort of internat ional industry\
  \ best practice.  \nA better standard of crew resource management could have prevented\
  \ the grounding \nin spite of the main engine cooling -water problem.  \nNavigation\
  \ practices (including crew resource management) are a critical shipboard \nfunction\
  \ that any safety management system should closely monitor to ensure that \nbest\
  \ industry practice is achieved.  \nThe safety management system for the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay  and its operating company did \nnot succeed in ensuring  that good crew\
  \ resource management was a standard feature \nof on -board operations.  \nThe master\
  \ not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging \n\
  with the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency\
  \ \nmanagement protocols that left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware\
  \ of \nthe issue they were dealing with.  This breach contributed to the Hanjin\
  \ Bombay  \ngrounding.  \n \n4.5 Port risk assessment  - tug escort  \n4.5.1  Port\
  \ of Tauranga  Limited's  risk assessment identified 73 potential hazards, of which\
  \ 18 were \ngrounding events, and of these 18 three  were grounding events in the\
  \ entrance channel \noutside No. 2 Reach.  Surprisingly , these 3 hazards referred\
  \ to inbound vessel s only, in spite \nof there having been 2 gr oundings of vessels\
  \ during outbound passages, one (the Schelde \nTrader ) under  similar circumstances\
  \  to this grounding and in almost the same location.  \n4.5.2  Since this grounding\
  \ Port of Tauranga Limited has reviewed its operating procedures around \nthe use\
  \ of tug escorts.  See Section 6 for full details.  The review list s a number of\
  \ factors for \npilots to consider when deciding if a tug escort is to be used.\
  \  However, t ransposing the Hanjin \nBombay 's departure into the revised model,\
  \ the pilot would not have been  likely to use a tug \nescort for any longer  than\
  \ he did on this occasion.  Referring to the criteria used  in the model , \nthe\
  \ Hanjin Bombay  was less than 25 years old, had a standard single -propeller/single\
  \ -rudder \nconfiguration  and had no history of mechanical failure ; and no maintenance\
  \ had been \nconducted on the machinery in port prior to departure  - yet it encountered\
  \ a mechanical \nproblem on the outward journey that ultimately led to the grounding.\
  \  \n4.5.3  Earlier in this report we referred to the complexity of  vessel  machinery\
  \  installations  and their  \ncontrol systems .  Using risk assessment methodology\
  \  the likelihood of a malfunction of some \nsort is high, even with well  maintained\
  \ vessels.   The data  for reported occurrences of \nmechanical failure during pilotage\
  \ in New Zealand alone show s this to be the case.   \nInformation supplied by Maritime\
  \ New Zealand showed that in the 30 months from 24 January \n  \nReport 10 -204\
  \ \n<< Page 23 >>\n 2010  there had been 30  reported  instances of machinery or\
  \ equipment failure on vessels in \nthe pilotage waters of New Zealand  ports. \
  \   \n4.5.4  For a vessel  like the Hanjin Bombay  that has only one propulsion\
  \ system, the risk of losing \ncontrol of the vessel  caused by  a single -point\
  \ failure is higher than that for other vessel s that \nhave  greater level s of\
  \ redundancy built in  to their propulsion and power -management systems .  \nThis\
  \ grounding was a relatively low -consequence event, although from the vessel  operator's\
  \ \nperspective there was some considerable expense in terms of repair costs and\
  \ disruption s to \nservice.  From the port company 's perspective there was the\
  \ disruption to shipping services \nfor one  tidal window of operation.   \n4.5.5\
  \  The eastern side of No. 2 Reach is a rocky shoreline, and this seems to be  the\
  \ shoreline where \nships are going to ground if propulsion is lost when making\
  \ the  turn into No. 2 Reach.  The \nconsequence s of any future grounding in this\
  \ area have  the potential to be much worse.  Port \nof Tauranga Limited would be\
  \ advised to reconsider its long -term strategy for the use of escort \ntugs if\
  \ the risk is to be reduced to a s low as reasonably practicable.  The Commission\
  \ \nrecommends that the port company address this safety issue  and that Maritime\
  \ New Zealand \nconsider this issue when approving or auditing Port and Harbour\
  \ Safety Management systems .   \n4.5.6  Port of Tauranga Limited has developed\
  \ within its safety management system a 'history' \ndatabase for vessel s that have\
  \ experienced technical malfunctions during Port of Tauranga \ntransits.  The system\
  \ has merit.  Such a system would have even more benefit if it was \nadopted on\
  \ a national basis.  Many vessel s transit several New Zealand ports during a round\
  \ \ntrip.  Information on p roblems experienced in one port should be pas sed on\
  \ to other ports so \nthat the risk s can be appropriately mitigated there.  Such\
  \ a database need not be restricted to \nmechanical issues.  A standard of crew\
  \ resource management is another piece of useful \ninformation for a pilot planning\
  \ for a vessel  arrival or departure.  Minor technical defects and \nhuman performance\
  \ issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on \nboard a\
  \ vessel.  Maritime New Zealand could use such a database to help focus its resources\
  \ \nfor best effect from a Port State Control perspective.  A recommendation has\
  \ been made to \nthe Director of Maritime New Zealand to consider this safety issue.\
  \  \n  \nFindings:  \nThe grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still\
  \ been in attendance in a \npassive or active escort role.  \nPort of Tauranga Limited's\
  \ risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety \nManagement System did not\
  \ fully address the risk of departing vessel s experiencing \nfailure of propulsion\
  \ and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance \nchannel.  \nIf\
  \ the issue s of mechanically unreliable vessel s and substandard crew resource\
  \ \nmanagement on vessel s operating in New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this\
  \ will \nneed to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing\
  \ with the issues \nas they  arise.  \n \n\n<< Page 24 >>"
