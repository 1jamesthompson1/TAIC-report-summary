- name: Mechanical Reliability and Maintenance
  explanation: Mechanical reliability and maintenance is a safety theme that involves ensuring that all machinery and equipment on a vessel are functioning correctly and are well maintained to prevent failures that could lead to accidents. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because the automatic main engine slowdown and shutdown events were caused by high cooling-water temperature, which was most likely caused by the malfunction of a 3-way valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water ("The automatic main engine slowdown and shutdown events were caused by high cooling-water temperature, which was most likely caused by the malfunction of a 3-way valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water" (5.1)). The malfunction of this critical component of the engine's cooling system directly contributed to the loss of propulsion and the subsequent grounding of the vessel.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  explanation: Crew resource management refers to the effective use of all available personnel, their skills, and information to achieve safe and efficient operations. This theme is highly relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident as the standard of crew resource management on board fell well short of international industry best practice, which could have prevented the grounding despite the main engine cooling-water problem ("The standard of crew resource management on board the Hanjin Bombay fell well short of international industry best practice" (5.5)). Furthermore, the master's failure to use English, the official working language of the ship, during the emergency, left the pilot and other bridge team members unaware of the issue they were dealing with, which contributed to the grounding ("The master not using English, the official working language of the ship, when engaging with the chief engineer as the emergency unfolded was a serious breach of emergency management protocols" (5.9)).
- name: Communication Protocols
  explanation: Communication protocols encompass the methods and standards for information exchange among crew members and between the ship and port authorities to ensure that everyone involved is aware of the situation and can act accordingly. This safety theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because better communication about the developing situation within the bridge team and between the bridge and engine room could have prevented the grounding through the better use of engines, tugs, and anchors ("Better communication about the developing situation within the bridge team and between the bridge and engine room could have prevented the Hanjin Bombay grounding" (5.4)). The lack of effective communication was a key factor that led to the vessel running aground.
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  explanation: Risk assessment and management involve identifying potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate the associated risks. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management system did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel ("Port of Tauranga Limited's risk assessment for its Ports and Harbours Safety Management system did not fully address the risk of departing vessels experiencing failure of propulsion and manoeuvring systems at critical locations in the entrance channel" (5.11)). The oversight in the risk assessment process contributed to the lack of preparedness for such an eventuality.
- name: Use of Tug Escorts
  explanation: The use of tug escorts is a safety measure that provides additional maneuvering capability and redundancy to a vessel, especially during critical operations such as entering or leaving a port. This safety theme is relevant because the grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive or active escort role ("The grounding could have been prevented if the tugs had still been in attendance in a passive or active escort role" (5.10)). The premature release of the tugs, without considering the vessel's condition and the critical phase of the operation, was a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  explanation: Emergency response preparedness refers to the readiness of the crew and the vessel to respond effectively to emergencies. This theme is relevant to the Hanjin Bombay accident because the facility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to override the automatic main engine shutdown, which might have prevented the vessel from running aground ("The facility was available both on the bridge and in the engine control room to override the automatic main engine shutdown, which might have resulted in damage to the main engine but probably would have prevented the vessel running aground" (5.3)). The lack of decisive action to use the override facility indicates a lack of preparedness to deal with the emergency situation.
