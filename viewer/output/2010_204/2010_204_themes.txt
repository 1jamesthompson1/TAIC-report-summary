Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Mechanical failure: The main cause of the accident was a malfunction of the 3-way valve used to regulate the temperature of the cooling water, leading to the engine automatically slowing down and shutting down.
2. Loss of control: The vessel's heavily loaded condition and reduced propeller wash past the rudder resulted in insufficient steering control, making it unable to overcome the momentum of the turn and prevent it from leaving the channel and grounding.
3. Communication and crew resource management: Poor communication within the bridge team and between the bridge and engine room, as well as the use of a language other than English during emergency situations, contributed to the grounding. The standard of crew resource management on board the vessel fell short of industry best practice.
