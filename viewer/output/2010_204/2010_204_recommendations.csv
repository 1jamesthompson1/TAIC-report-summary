2010_204,004/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and harbour authorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel defects and crew performance issues. The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately available to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage operations at subsequent ports. The purpose of the system should not be to replace the mandatory reporting of accidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.","The number of defects that are causing incidents and accidents in New Zealand pilotage waters is of concern. It is an indication that New Zealand port and harbour authorities cannot totally rely on the International Safety Management system to ensure that vessels transiting New Zealand ports are operated safely and efficiently. Minor technical defects and human performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on board a vessel. If the issues of mechanically unreliable vessels and substandard crew resource management on vessels operating into New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues as they arise.

2010_204,005/13,"The Commission recommends that, once the Marine Legislation Bill has been enacted and the new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force, the Director address this safety issue with all port authorities, including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management Systems.","Vessels' machinery installations and their control systems are complex, and regardless of how well maintained they are there will always remain the possibility that some part fails for some reason. For a vessel like the Hanjin Bombay that has only one propulsion system, the risk of losing control of the vessel caused by a single-point failure is higher than that for other vessels that have greater levels of redundancy built in to their propulsion and power-management systems. These types of vessel rely heavily on tug services when operating in confined pilotage waters.
Port of Tauranga Limited's Port and Harbour Safety system policy on the level of tug service did not adequately manage the risk of single-point failures leading to the loss of control of a vessel. This is a safety issue that could also be relevant to other New Zealand ports.
The Maritime Transport Act 1994 currently restricts the Director's powers to audit port operators. However, the Commission notes that the Marine Legislation Bill currently before Parliament will introduce a new Part 3A to the Maritime Transport Act, which will provide clear authority for the Director to take action in relation to port operations.
