- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  explanation: The maintenance and inspection regimes for pressure vessels on board ships are a critical safety theme related to this accident. The nitrogen cylinder that burst was "overdue for maintenance and testing, and should not have been in service at the time of the accident" (4.1.2). The maintenance schedule was calendar-based, and the hydrostatic pressure testing of nitrogen cylinders was scheduled every 10 years, but the failed cylinder was overdue for testing by one year and five months (4.3.4). This indicates that the maintenance and inspection schedules were not adequately followed or enforced, leading to the use of equipment that was not fit for purpose. Additionally, the maintenance regime did not detect the severe corrosion that weakened the cylinder (4.2.1), highlighting the inadequacy of the inspection processes in place.
- name: Corrosion Protection and Environmental Exposure
  explanation: Corrosion protection and environmental exposure of pressure vessels are significant safety themes in this accident. The cylinder that failed was "severely weakened by corrosion" due to "very little to no protection from sea spray" (4.1.2). The location of the cylinders exposed them to a harsh marine environment, which can accelerate corrosion if not adequately protected (4.4.6). The failure to protect the cylinders from environmental factors and to detect the onset of corrosion through regular and thorough inspections contributed to the accident.
- name: Training and Certification of Inspection Personnel
  explanation: The training and certification of personnel responsible for inspecting stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders are crucial safety themes. The accident highlighted that "technicians who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and five-yearly inspections of lifeboat-launching installations are not required to have specific training and certification for inspecting any stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders" (4.1.3). The technician who inspected the cylinders prior to the accident did not have the formal training to assess that the cylinder was not fit for purpose and posed a serious safety risk (4.5.5). This lack of specialized training for inspectors could lead to oversight of critical safety issues, as was the case in this incident.
- name: Global Standards for Pressure Cylinder Inspection
  explanation: The establishment of global minimum standards for the inspection, testing, and rejection of pressure cylinders is a safety theme that emerges from this accident. The analysis identified that "there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy systems on lifeboat launching installations" (4.1.3). This lack of standardized procedures has resulted in "a wide variation in, and in some cases inadequate, standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised service providers" (4.4). The absence of consistent global standards contributed to the failure to identify the compromised condition of the nitrogen cylinder.
- name: Protective Coatings and Material Selection
  explanation: The use of protective coatings and the selection of materials for pressure vessels are safety themes relevant to this accident. The report suggests that "other options could include the use of better coating and steel protection systems for steel bottles, such as galvanising" (4.3.7). The cylinder that failed was not adequately protected from the corrosive marine environment, leading to severe corrosion and eventual failure (4.2.1). The choice of materials and protective coatings is essential to ensure the longevity and safety of pressure vessels in marine settings.
- name: Inspection and Maintenance Documentation
  explanation: Proper documentation of inspection and maintenance activities is a safety theme related to this accident. The deck team's cosmetic-focused inspections were not logged as a matter of record, which could mask potential problem areas (4.3.9). The lack of thorough records and documentation of maintenance activities can prevent the detection of issues that may compromise the safety of pressure vessels. The failure to document and address the corrosion on the cylinder that burst indicates a gap in the ship's maintenance practices.
