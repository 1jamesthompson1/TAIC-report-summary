","0.0","0.0","The document states that ""The crew were following the correct procedure for recharging the nitrogen cylinders when the cylinder burst"" (4.1.2). This indicates that the accident was not due to human error or incorrect assumptions.
","0.0","10.0","The document highlights a safety issue where ""technicians who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and five-yearly inspections of lifeboat-launching installations are not required to have specific training and certification for inspecting any stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders"" (4.1.3). This lack of specific training may have contributed to the failure to identify the dangerous condition of the cylinder.
","0.0","10.0","The accident may have been influenced by the lack of specialized training for technicians inspecting pressure cylinders, as ""formal training in the assessment of pressure cylinders would have better prepared the technician to determine that the cylinder was not fit for purpose and posed a serious safety risk"" (4.5.5).
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document to suggest that the accident was related to the use of available resources, teamwork, or communication among the crew, which are aspects of Crew Resource Management.
","0.0","0.0","The crew were adhering to the correct procedures at the time of the accident, as stated in the document: ""The crew were following the approved and appropriate procedure for re-pressurising the stored energy system"" (5.1).
","0.0","13.333","The organizational safety culture may have contributed to the accident, as the maintenance plan did not detect or remedy the corrosion issue, and the cylinder was overdue for maintenance and testing (4.1.2). Additionally, the operator has since updated its maintenance plan to track the age of each cylinder based on its manufacture date, rather than its installation date, indicating a change in organizational practices following the accident (4.3.4).
","11.547","13.333","The failure to identify the severe corrosion and the overdue maintenance of the nitrogen cylinder indicate a lack of effective risk management and analysis. The document states that ""the various inspection regimes that gave effect to that plan did not detect or remedy the issue before the failure occurred"" (4.1.2).
","11.547","20.0","The document identifies a safety issue related to the lack of global minimum standards for the inspection, testing, and rejection of pressure cylinders, leading to inadequate standards applied by various authorities (4.1.3, 4.4). This lack of regulatory oversight and compliance with consistent standards contributed to the accident.
