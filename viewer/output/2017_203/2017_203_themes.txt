Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Corrosion and lack of maintenance: The failure of the nitrogen cylinder was caused by severe corrosion, which weakened the cylinder and compromised its ability to withstand internal pressure. The ship's maintenance plan and inspection regimes did not detect or remedy the corrosion issue before the failure occurred. The cylinder that failed was overdue for maintenance and testing, indicating a lack of proper maintenance practices.

2. Lack of global standards: The report highlights the absence of global minimum standards for the inspection, testing, and rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy systems on lifeboat launching installations. This lack of standards has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some cases inadequate, standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies, and authorized service providers.

3. Insufficient training and certification: Technicians who are authorized to conduct mandatory inspections of lifeboat-launching installations are not required to have specific training and certification for inspecting stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders. This lack of specialized training and certification can lead to inadequate assessments of the fitness for purpose of pressure cylinders and pose serious safety risks.

4. Inadequate inspection standards: The report highlights the lack of recommended minimum standards for the inspection, testing, and rejection of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators. The existing guidelines do not provide sufficient standards to ensure that stored energy systems are in satisfactory condition and operation. The inspection standards vary greatly between different flag state administrations, leading to inconsistency in inspections and potential safety risks.

5. Need for better maintenance and inspection practices: The report suggests the need for reducing the time between testing for cylinders exposed to seawater environments and implementing a more rigorous inspection regime to detect early onset corrosion. It also recommends exploring the use of better coating and steel protection systems for steel bottles. Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of having personnel trained and experienced in the inspection of pressure vessels to ensure their safe operation.

6. Urgent need for global standards: The report concludes that there is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards to be developed at a global level for maintaining, inspecting, testing, and replacing high-pressure cylinders associated with stored energy systems on board ships. This highlights the importance of establishing comprehensive and uniform standards to ensure the safety of marine vessels.
