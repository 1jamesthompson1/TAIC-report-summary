The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.   Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to impro ve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring in to maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occ urrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commissio n carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 9 February 2017, the crew of the Bermuda -flagged passenger ship Emerald Princess  were 
conducting maintenance on one of the lifeboat launching systems while the ship was berthed 
at Port Chalmers, Dunedin.  
1.2. The maintenance was completed and the crew were restoring pressure to a b ank of high -
pressure nitrogen -gas cylinders that formed part of the launching davit 'stored energy' system . 
One of the nitrogen bottles burst, fatally injuring a crew member who was standing close by.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commis sion) found  that the nitrogen 
cylinder  burst at below its normal working pressure because severe external corrosion had 
reduced the wall thickness to about 30% of its original thickness.  
1.4. The failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders within the stored energy 
system, despite having been surveyed about two weeks earlier , were not fit for purpose and 
should not have been left in service.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that there  is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards 
to be developed at a global level for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, 
replacing high -pressure cylinders associated with stored energy systems on board ships.  
1.6. The operator took a number of immediate safety actions  to prevent  a recurrence of the 
accident  on any of its ships . 
1.7. The Commission issued an interim report with early  recommendations  to the equipment 
manufacturer , the International Soci ety of Classification Societies , the Cru ise Lines 
International Association and Maritime New Zealand to alert their members and surveyors as 
appropriate to the circumstances of the accident and to have the condition of similar 
installations checked.  
1.8. The Commission made two additional recommendat ions: one for the manufacturer to improve 
training for its surveyors; and one for Maritime New Zealand to raise , through the appropriate 
International Maritime Organi zation safety committee for its consideration, the implications for 
maritime safety of not  having adequate minimum standards for the inspection , testing and 
rejection of pressure vessels that are part of stored energy system s. 
1.9. A key lesson  arising from this inquiry is:  
 any sign of corrosion on high -pressure cylinders should be fully investigated by a person 
competent in examining high -pressure cylinders before any remedial work is undertaken 
and the cylinder s are  allowed back into service .

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 9 February 2017 Maritime New Zealand reported a fatal explosion on board the passenger 
cruise ship Emerald Princess .  
2.2. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) opened an inquiry under 
section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an 
investigator in charge.  
2.3. On 10 February 2017 two investigators from the Commission boarded the Emerald Princess  in 
Dunedin to conduct interviews and gather evidence.  
2.4. On 27 February  2017  an investigator boarded the Emerald Princess  in Wellington to conduct 
further interviews with the ship's crew.   They were accompanied by a metallurgist who made a 
visual examination of the lifeboat1 launching arrangement.  
2.5. On 29 February 2017 an examination of evidence was conducted by a metallurgist at t he 
Commission's technical facility . 
2.6. On 6 April 2017 two investigators boarded the Emerald Princess  in Wellington to conduct 
further interviews with the ship's crew . 
2.7. On 10 April 2017 the Commission approved the publication of an interim report.  
2.8. On 30 May 2017 the Commission conducted an interview with the manufacturer of the 
lifeboat -launching equipment installed on the Emerald Princess . 
2.9. The Commission liaised  with industry experts over the next 12 months and assessed  industry 
best practice and r elevant rules and regulations on the maintenance  of pressure vessels  
associated with lifeboat  launching equipment.  
2.10.  On 17 June 2018 t he Commission conducted a second interview with the manufacturer of the 
lifeboat  launching equipment . 
2.11.  On 19 September 2018  the Commission  approved the draft report to be circulated to 11 
interested persons for comment.  
2.12.  The Commission received submissions from five interested persons, and any changes as a 
result of these submissions have been included in this final report . 
2.13.  The Commission approved the report for publication on 21 November 2018 .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  On 9 February 2017 the Bermuda -flagged passenger ship Emerald Princess  berthed at Port 
Chalmers , Dunedin  carrying 3 ,113 passengers and 1 ,173 crew on  board.   The Emerald 
Princess  was fitted with 18 lifeboats, six passenger tenders2 and two fast rescue boats. The 
boats were stowed on deck 8 and could be lowered and raised using the lifeboat launching 
and recovery davits3. 
3.1.2.  The davits were hydraulically powered by six hydraulic power packs, three power packs for 
each side of t he vessel.  The International Convention for the  Safety of Life a t Sea (SOLAS) 
regulations required  that an emergency launching and recovery system be provided so that 
the lifeboats could be launched even if the ship suffered a total power failure.  To comply with 
this regulation , a stored en ergy system4 comprising an accumulator5 and a set of  high-
pressure  nitrogen cylinders was fitted to each launching davit.  
3.1.3.  The nitrogen system had a nominal working press ure range of 180 -200 bar6.  Prior to the 
vessel's arrival at Dunedin, the crew had observed that the pressure of the nitrogen system for 
lifeboat station No. 24 had dropped to about 165 bar .

 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On arrival at Dunedin  on 9 February 2017 , the staff engineer tasked the deck and safety 
engineer  with tracing the source of the nitrogen leak with the assistance of  two fitters , Fitter -A 
and Fitter -B. 
 
Figure 3 
Location of lifeboat station  No. 24 
3.2.2.  At about 0900 on 9 February 2017 , Fitter -A and the deck  and safety engineer  carried out a 
soap bubble test7 on the  nitrogen piping system and the fittings on the nitrogen cylinder , but 
they found no source of the leak.   They did not soap bubble test the nitrogen cylinders  
because they thought it was highly unlikely that the pressuri sed cylinders had been 
structurally compromised.  
3.2.3.  In the absence of any visible leaks , the staff engineer  advised  the deck and safety engineer  to 
replace the pneumatic manifold8 because it had been prone to leakages  and was most likely 
the source of the leak.  
3.2.4.  In order to replace the pneumatic  manifold,  the deck officer and fitter followed the equipment 
manufacturer 's instructions and depressurised  the stored energy system.  
3.2.5.  Once the pneumatic manifold had been  replaced an d connections made fast , the deck and 
safety engineer  instructed  Fitter-A and Fitter -B to re -pressuri se the stored energy system by 
connecting a fully c harged spare nitrogen cylinder to the pneumatic manifold  via a recharging 
hose.  
3.2.6.  The deck and safety engineer  then left the two fitters to complete this work , to assist  another 
fitter on deck 3 with other repair work.  
3.2.7.  Fitter -A and Fitter -B proceeded to increase the nitrogen pressure to about 160 bar , then 
informed the deck and safety engineer  that the pre ssure appeared to be holding and the 
pressure gauge  did not indicate any leaks.  
3.2.8.  The deck and safety engineer  consulted the staff engineer , who advised start ing the hydraulic 
pump  and increas ing the nitroge n pressure to  its maximum normal working pressure of  200 
bar. The deck and safety engineer  conveyed this message to Fitter -A and Fitter -B and 
proceeded to deck 3 to continue assisting with the  other repair work.     
3.2.9.  At about 1700 Fitter -B went to deck 7 where the hydrau lic pumps were located , and started 
the pump while Fitter -A remained on deck 8 to monitor the rise of the nitrogen pressure on a 
control panel  close to the nitrogen cylinders  (see Figure  4 for the location of the control panel) .  
3.2.10.  About a minute after the hydraulic pump was start ed, a nitrogen cylinder  located on lifeboat 
station  No. 24 burst , fatally  wounding Fitter -A.

 3.3. Stored energy system  
3.3.1.  The lifeboats on  board the Emerald Princess  were  lowered from and raised onto the vessel 
using telescopic overhead davit arms . The telescopic arms on the davit were  moved by 
hydraulic pistons that were  powered by two submerged hydraulic pumps.  
3.3.2.  If the hydraulic pumps failed, the stored energy system would provide emergency backup 
power.  The system comprise d an accumulator and a set of nitrogen cylinders (see Figure 4). 
3.3.3.  The upper chamber of the accumulat or was filled with nitrogen gas at a maximum working 
pressure of about 200 bar at 20 degrees. The nitrogen pressure was maintained by a set of 
pressuris ed nitrogen cylinders connected to the upper chamber via a pneumatic manifold. The 
manifold was fitted w ith an overpressure relief device set at 250 bar.  The lower chamber of 
the accumulator was filled with hydraulic oil at a maximum working pressure of about 230 bar. 
In between the lower and upper chamber s was a piston. In the event of a power failure this  
piston was pressuris ed by the nitrogen gas in the upper chamber and pushed downwards , 
pressuris ing the hydraulic oil in the lower chamber of the accumulator , which in turn operate d 
the hydraulic piston that move d the telescopic davit arms (Figure 6 is a s chematic diagram of 
the lifeboat launching appliance ; the red line shows the operation of the stored energy 
system) . 
3.4. Nitrogen cylinder installation  
3.4.1.  Each lifeboat station  had four nitrogen cylinders .  Each cylinder had a capacity of 40 litres and 
was f illed with nitrogen to its normal  working pressure of about 200  bar.  The cylinders were 
held in a steel frame that raised and restrained the base of each cylinder above the deck.   
3.4.2.  The cylinders were held in place near t he top by two round bar steel U -bolt str aps.  One U -bolt 
went around a forward cylinder s and an aft cylinder and was fastened to the rear por tion of 
the frame  (see Figure 7) .  The front two cylinders of the four in the frame had a steel suppor t 
strip under the restraining U -bolt to prevent the c ylinder s being mechanically damaged.  A 
steel strip separate d the forward cylinder s from the aft cylinders

 3.4.3.  The nitrogen cylinder s had been  manufactured  by Tenaris  in Dalmine Italy, and designed to 
EN1964  3-20019 standards .  Each cylinder  was fabricated  from  a one-piece  forging , with a 
shrink -fitted  foot ring10 and a threaded neck ring attached.   
3.4.4.  The cylinders were made in batches of no more than  202.  Two cylinders from ea ch batch 
were  tested for quality through  a burst pressure test11 on one cylinder and a mechanical test 
on the other.  These t ests were witnessed by a surveyor from Lloyds R egister.  The Lloyds 
Register certificate stated that the fabrication  of cylinders  was completed  as per  Lloyd 
Register's  procedures and specifications . In addition , the surveyor visually inspected each 
cylinde r and h ydraulically tested it at 300 bar.  Figure 8 shows t he cylinder dimensions.  
3.4.5.  The failed nitrogen cylinder had been  hydrostatically pressure tested on  5 September 2005 at 
the time of fabrication .  The burst pressure test certificate showed that  the test cylinder burst 
at 530 bar .

3.5. Post-accident inspection and testing  
The process  
3.5.1.  The remains of the burst nitrogen cylinder were  recovered together with the other three 
cylinders from the same frame.  The top of the burst cylinder was never found, having probably 
been ejected into the sea.  A randomly  selected cylinder from another bank  of cylinders was 
also removed from the vessel  for examination.  
3.5.2.  All five cylinders were taken to the Commission's te chnical facility in Wellington , where an 
independent metallurgist  examined them .

 Examination of the failed cylinder  
3.5.3.  A visual examination of the failed cylinder showed that the failure w as typical  of an over -
pressure burst .  A single split had occurred  along the length of the cylinder and the cylinder 
head was missing.  
3.5.4.  The burst nitrogen cylinder had suffered significant corrosion at the point of failure, which was 
situated approximately  150 millimetres ( mm) below where the steel securing band had 
clamped the cylinder within its frame.  The corrosion had developed on the outside of the 
cylinder.  The internal surface was clear of corrosion.  Corrosion had reduced the thickness of 
the cyli nder wall by about 70% at the point of failure (from 4.8  mm to about 1.5  mm).  A 
second area of corrosion was noted near to the bottom of the cylinder and a third area where 
the protective coating had been scraped away to observe the cylinder's identificat ion details . 
3.5.5.  The metallurgist made the following observation s in his report : 
Examination  of the fracture revealed that the fracture  had initiated  at a region of 
corrosion that was about 1.1 m from the original base of the cylinder  
Examination of the corrode d area showed:  
Failure  had passed through the middle of the region  of corrosion .  
The fracture surface of the failure wa s typical of overload.  There was no 
evidence of fatigue or any other pre -existing defect being present.  
The majority  of corrosion product had been lost from the surface  
The c orroded  region was oval shaped with the following dimensions :  
Axial length 200 to 230mm  
Wall thickness :  
Minimum 1.45mm to 1.56 i.e.  both sides of the failure   
Away from the corrosion  the cylinder was 5.35mm to 5.9mm thick i.e. thicker 
than the minimum specified of 4.81mm  
The paint had spalled off the surface.  This is indication that the underlying steel 
had been strained  
Away from the corroded area the fracture was typical of ducti le overload .  
An area of corrosi on was also present on the cylinder  near the base and direct ly 
below the main area of corrosion  where the failure initiated.  
The foot of the failed cylinder was found separated from the cylinder. 
Examination of th is and the  base of the cylinder showed they were both corroded 
and a significant amount of paint was missing.

 Examination of a randomly  selected cylinder  
3.5.6.  The metallurgist inspected a  randomly  selected cylinder from the Emerald Princess  and found 
the base of the cylinder extremely corroded.  
3.5.7.  He made  the followi ng observation s in his report :  
Examination of the intact cylinder revealed that extreme corrosion  was present 
on the base of the cylinder in the r egion of the foot ring.  
The following were measured on the parallel section of the cylinder away from 
the da mage.

Examination of  accumulators on board the Emerald Princess  
3.5.8.  The hydraulic accumulator is part of the stored energy system.  It is a pressure storage 
reservoir in which a hydraulic fluid is held un der pressure by nitrogen gas .  The metallurgist 
observed significant corrosion on at least two  accumulators whilst on board the Emerald 
Princess .  
3.5.9.  The metallurgist 's report stated:  
The surface of pressure vessel that houses the hydraulic oil/air piston at lifeboat 
station 25 was obviously bulged as result of the build -up of corrosion products 
under the paint and under the support strap. The depth of corrosion was 
unknown.

3.6. The maintenance and inspection regime on  board the Emerald Princess  
3.6.1.  Each week t he ship's crew  carried out a visual inspection of the stored energy system.  Each 
month a  lifeboat launching drill was conducted  using the stored energy system to ensure  that 
it was in good working order.  
3.6.2.  The mainte nance plan on board the Emerald Princess  stated that nitrogen cylinders were to 
be hydrostatically tested every 10 years .  The vessel's flag state12 also required that the 
nitrogen cylinders be tested every 10 years . The nitrogen cylinder that burst  had been  
manufactured in September 2005 and was due for hydro static pressure testing13 in 
September 2015.  A t the time of the accident the cylinder  had not been pres sure tested and 
was overdue by one  year and five months.  The maintenance plan had been loaded with the 
date when the cylinders were installed on the ship at the time of build ing, rather than the date 
of manufacture . 
3.6.3.  The stored energy system was part of the lifeboat launching appliance .  The Internationa l 
Maritim e Organization  (IMO)  guidelines that w ere applicable at the time  required  lifeboat s and 
associated launching appliances to be  inspected annual ly.  The guidelines required  a more in -
depth inspection every five years .  The IMO also required that the service provider carrying out

carried out on 21 January 2017,  19 days prior to the accident.   
3.6.5.  The five-yearly inspection  report  prepared by the authorised service provider14 stated that the 
nitrogen cylinders on  board the Emerald Princess  were aged and the company should 
consider swap ping them with new nitrogen cylinders.   The report also stated th at at least one  
accumulator was  corroded and the operator should  consider engaging the equipment 
manufacturer  to overh aul and certify the accumu lator .  (See Appendix  1 for relevant sections

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Pressure vessels are widely used on  board ships for various applications .  Their  failure can be 
catastrophic and may result  in human injury and death , as was the case on board  the Emerald 
Princess .  
4.1.2.  The crew were follow ing the correct procedure for recharging the nitrogen cylinders when the 
cylinder burst.  The failed cylinder was one of four located at lifeboat station No.  24 and had 
very little to no protection from sea spray.  The cylinder was severely weakened by corrosion , 
which caused it to fail under normal working loads .  The shipboard maintenance plan and the 
various inspection regimes that gave effect to that plan did not detect or remedy the issue 
before the failure occurred.  T he cylinder that failed was  overdue for maintenance  and testing,  
and should not have been in service at the time of the accident.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses why the nitrogen cylinder  remain ed in service despite being in 
a danger ous condition .  The analysis raise s the following two safety issues : 
 there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection 
of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored e nergy systems on lifeboat launching 
installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some case inadequate, 
standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised 
service providers  
 technicians who are author ised to conduct mandatory annual and five -yearly inspections 
of lifeboat -launching installations are not required to have specific training and 
certification for inspecting any stored energy -release systems and their associated 
pressure cylinders.  
4.2. Why did the cylinder burst?  
4.2.1.  The cylinder burst because a region of severe corrosion reduced the cylinder wall thickness 
from about 4.81  mm to 1.45  mm and significantly compromised the cylinder's ability to 
withstand internal pressure.  As a result, the cylinder su ffered an overpressure burst while the 
crew attempted to raise the nitrogen pressure from 160 bar to its normal working pressure of 
200 bar.  
4.2.2.  There is no clear evidence as to why this particular cylinder was so heavily corroded in the 
area where the failure  started.  The adjacent cylinders in the frame were not heavily corroded. 
Corrosion can be initiated by a number of factors.  Mechanical damage to the protective 
coating in a saltwater environment is a common cause.  Seawater being trapped against a 
steel surface can accelerate corrosion.  The straps that retained the bottles in the frame is a 
place where seawater could have become trapped.  They could also  have  initiate d mechanical 
damage to the protective coating.  However, as Figure 15 shows, the locatio n where the worst 
corrosion occurred was not where the straps were in contact with the bottles.  
4.2.3.  There was no evidence of any pre -existing crack occurring before the failure.  The source of 
the leak in the system that the crew were trying to remedy was neve r found.

Figure 15 
Location of burst on failed cylinder  
4.3. On-board maintenance and inspection of pressure vessels  
Maintenance   
4.3.1.  The maintenance schedule for nitrogen cylinders and accumulators  was calendar based .  That 
is, time was the trigger for the various inspections and test s.  Weekly and monthly routines 
were carried out by the crew , while major maintenance work such as h ydrostatic pressure 
testing of nitrogen cylinders  was designated to an authorised service provider  or sh ore-based 
testing facility . 
4.3.2.  Hydrostatic pressure testing is a standard method of pressure testing cylinders.  It involves 
filling a cylinder with water and pressuris ing it up to 1.5 times its design pressure limit.  The 
pressure is then held for a prescribed amount of time and the cylinder is  then  inspected for 
leaks.  
4.3.3.  The maintenance regime on board the Emerald Princess  was kept in a  computer -based 
maintenance  system.  
4.3.4.  The hydrostatic pressure testing of nitrogen cyli nders was scheduled to have been carried out 
every 10 years , starting from the date they were  first h ydrostatically pressure tested. H owever, 
the start date entered into the maintenance plan was May 2007,  which was  the date that the 
nitrogen cylinders were installed on the vessel during b uild.  However, the  cylinder that failed  
had been  manufactured in September 2005, which was when it was first pressure tested.  
Therefore , it was overdue for testing by one  year and five  months at the time of the accident.  
The operator has now addressed this issue and updated its maintenance plan so that it tracks 
the age of each cylinder based on  its manufacture date , rather than its installation date . 

Final Report MO -2017 -203 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.3.5.  If the failed bottle had been inspected and tested by a competent author ity 17 months earlier, 
it is very likely that it would have been condemned and the accident avoided .  The depth of the 
corrosion in the cylinder wall was such that it almost certainly would have been prevalent 17 
months earlier.  
4.3.6.  Ten years is a long time be tween testing, particularly for cylinders that are exposed to a 
seawater environment.  Authorities might need to consider reducing this period in some 
circumstances, or at least having a more rigorous inspection regime to detect any early onset 
of corrosio n. 
4.3.7.  Other options could include the use of better coating and steel protection systems for steel 
bottles, such as galvanising.  
Inspection  
4.3.8.  The deck team and engineering team maintained the lifeboat launching equipment .  Both 
teams inspect ed the nitr ogen cyl inders and accumulators  with different  objectives .  The deck 
team's work was cosmetic -focused .  The engineering team 's work was more condition -based.  
They were inspect ing the accumulators and nitrogen cylinders for condition and operational 
reliability.  
4.3.9.  The deck  team carried out visual inspec tions of the nitrogen cylinders , and any signs of rust 
were  scrap ed off with scrap ers and painted  over.  Due to the cosmetic nature of this work it 
was not log ged as a matter of record.   Paint can mask a potential pro blem area.  If , for 
example, a steel surface is not properly treated prior to painting, coating the area with fresh 
paint can mask a problem area, and in the worst case salt can be come  trapped under the 
paint and accelerate rather than slow the corrosion process.  
4.3.10.  Any sign of corrosion on a pressure cylinder is cause for concern , and for that reason the 
treatment of that corrosion should be preceded by a thorough inspection by a person 
competent in assessing the pressure cylinder's fitness for purpose.  
4.4. Inspection standards  
Safety issue: There are currently no global  minimum standards for the inspection, testing and 
rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy system s on lifeboat 
launching installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some cases 
inadequate, standards applied by  flag state administrations, classification societies and 
authorised service providers . 
International Maritime Organi zation : Resolution MSC .402(96) 
4.4.1.  The IMO has taken a number of steps to address  fatal accidents  involving lifeboats and 
associated equipment.  The IMO noted that one of the reasons for these accidents was the 
inadequate maintenance of lifeboats,  davits and launching equipment.  As a result , in May 
2016  the IMO adopted resolution MSC .402(96) , which set out to establish a uniform and safe 
inspection regime for lifeboats and their launching appliances , while also ensuring that the 
personnel carrying  out these inspections were  authorised and certified to do so.  This 
mandatory resolution will come into force on 1 January 2020 , but existed as guideline s15 at 
the time of the accident.  
4.4.2.  The resolution state d that weekly and monthly  inspections of launching  appliances could  be 
carried out by shipboard personnel under the direction of a senior ship's officer .  However, it 
also state d that annual and five -yearly inspections  and operational  tests should  be carried out  
by certified person nel representing the  manufacturer or an authori sed service provider.   
                                                        
15 MSC. 1/Circ.1206. Rev.1, Measures to Prevent Accidents  with Lifeboats and MSC.1/Circ.1277, Interim 
Recommendation on Conditions for Authorisation of Service Providers for Lifeboats, Launching Appliances 
and On -Load Release Gear.  
 
Final Report MO -2017 -203 
<< Page 20 >>
 4.4.3.  The resolution  also described in detail the examinations and operational tests that should  be 
performed on lifeboats, launching appliances and on -load release gear.   
Stored energy system  not included  
4.4.4.  Under the applicable guidelines, stored energy systems were to be examined annually for 
'satisfactory condition and operation '; however, neither the guidelines nor the new resolution 
provide d any recommended  minimum 'maintenance and inspection ' standards to ensure that 
the stored energy system was in a "satisfactory condition and operation ". 
4.4.5.  The IMO provide d guidelines on the  recommended minimum standards for the inspection, 
testing and rejection of similar pressure cylinders on board ships , for example carbon dioxide 
cylinders that form part of a fixed carbon dioxide  fire-extinguishing  system , and oxygen 
cylinders that form part of self -contained breathing apparatus .  These  guidelines were 
intended to supplement  the manufacturers ' approved maintenance  instructions while 
providing  a common minimum standard across the maritime industry  for the maintenance and 
inspection of these pressure cylinders . 
4.4.6.  The other cylinders described  above are typically installed or kept in locations protected from 
salt water  environment s.  Stored energy systems , on the other hand , are usually located on  
sheltered or open decks, yet there are no overarching standards for examining and testing 
them.  
4.4.7.  Standards for i nspection, testing and rejecti ng nitrogen cylinders and accumulato rs, if any , are 
limited to those imposed by vessels ' flag state s16. The inspection standards vary greatly  
between different flag state administrations .  For example, some flag states require that 
nitrogen cylinders be removed from vessel s and hydrostatically tested every 10 years , while 
others  do not.   
4.4.8.  A further consideration for the maintenance of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators is that 
their condition may not necessarily be time bound.  A n authorised service provider observed 
that the condition  of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators  varied across vessels.   Sometimes 
six-year-old pressure cylinders were observed  to be severely corroded and deemed not fit for 
purpose, while on other ships 15-year-old pressure cylinders were  found to be  in good 
condition and fit for purpose.   This variation in condition may be attributed to a number of 
factors , such as the vessels ' trading route s, the location s of the cylinders , the on -board 
maintenance regime s and the standard s of inspection . 
4.4.9.  A lack of guidelines or recommended minimum standards for the inspection, testing and 
rejection of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators meant  that authorised service provide rs, 
classification societies and flag state administrations were unable to apply a c ommon 
approach and carry out inspect ions based on a common  minimum standard.  
4.5. Training and certification  
Safety issue: Technician s who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and five -yearly 
inspections of lifeboat -launching installations are not require d to have  specific training and 
certification  for inspecting any stored energy -release systems and their associated pressure 
cylinders . 
4.5.1.  MSC .402(96) set the conditions for  the authorisation  of service providers .  This was  to ensure 
that the testing and inspection of lifeboats, launching appliances and on -load release  gear 
were  carried out in accordance with SOLAS Chapter III, regulation 20 .  
4.5.2.  Further, the technicians carrying out the annual and five -yearly inspections of li feboats, 
launching appliances and on -load release gear were  to be certified by the manufacture r or 
                                                        
16 A flag state may impose regula tions over and above the mandatory standards prescribed by the IMO.  For 
example, although the IMO did not require the nitrogen cylinders to be hydrostatically pressure tested every 
10 years, Bermuda, the Emerald Princess 's flag state, required the vessel to comply with this requirement.  
Final Report MO -2017 -203

 authori sed service provider  for each make and type of equipment  that was required to  be 
inspected .  
4.5.3.  The technicians were required to complete education, trai ning and competence assessment s 
before being allowed to carry out any such inspection.   As a minimum  the education  included 
the relevant rules and regulations, design and construction of lif eboats and launching 
appliances.   
4.5.4.  The technicians ' training  includ ed procedures for examin ing, test ing, operat ing and repair ing 
lifeboats and their launching appliances .  However,  it did not include any specialised training 
in and certification for the inspection of any associated pressure  cylinders .  There was no 
regulatory requirement  to have th ese.  
4.5.5.  The authorised  technician  who carried out the five -yearly inspection of the accumulator and 
nitrogen cylinders on board the Emerald Princess , just prior to the accident, noted that the 
nitrogen cylinders  should  be considered  for replacement .  The technician was not to know that 
on the cylinder that failed , corrosion had reduced the wall thickness at the fracture -initiation 
region to about 30% of the original thickness .  Formal training in the assessment of pressure 
cylinders would have better prepared the technician to determine  that the cylinder was not fit 
for purpose  and posed a serious safety risk . 
4.5.6.  The metallurgist  who examined the nitrogen cylinders and accumulators installed on the 
Emerald Princess  was experienced in assessing the condition of pressure cylinders.  The 
metallurgist noted that corrosion was present on foot rings  fitted  on a number of nitrogen 
cylinders , especially w here they were in contact with the support frame.  
4.5.7.  The metallurgist also noted that the accumulator  at lifeboat station  Nos. 24 and 25 was 
"obviously  bulged as a result of the build -up of corrosion  products under the paint and under 
the support strap ".  The metallurgist's assessment was that at least two accumulators  on 
board th e Emerald Princess  should  have been cond emned as unsafe to operat e.   
4.5.8.  Nitrogen cylinders and accumulators are high-pressure  vessels  often exposed to harsh marine 
environment s.  There would  be significant safety benefit s from their being  inspected by 
person s trained and experience d in the inspection of pressure vessels .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The crew were following the approved and appropriate procedure for re -pressurising the 
stored energy system . 
5.2. The cylinder failed at below its normal working pressure because sever e external corrosion 
had reduced the wall thickness from 4.81  millimetres  to 1.45  millimetres  (about 30% of its 
original thickness) . 
5.3. Despite the stored energy system having been surveyed in accordance with the international 
requirements of the Internationa l Maritime Organi zation MSC.1/Circ ular.1206 only two weeks 
earlier, the failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders were not fit for 
purpose and should not have remained in service.  
5.4. There is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards to be developed at a global level 
for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, replacing high-pressure  cylinders 
associated with stored energy systems on board ships.

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actio ns taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Since the accident Princess Cruise Lines  Limited  (the owner/ operator) has taken the followin g 
safety actions:  
On board the Emerald Princess  - all nitrogen cylinders on board were 
immediately closed as a precaution.  A visual inspection was then undertaken of 
all cylinders and, once it was clear that corrosion may have been the cause of the 
failur e, all cylinders on board were depressurised and replaced.  This process 
was completed by 9 March 2017; and  across the entire fleet, including:  
a fleet -wide visual inspection of all nitrogen cylinders for corrosion.  No serious 
defect was observed from thi s inspection, although the Group's safety team 
noted that, given the circumstances of the incident, a normal visual inspection 
was insufficient to identify material corrosion in all circumstances.  This 
observation has been taken into account in the long t erm policy revisions (as to 
which, see below);  
a fleet -wide inventory of all nitrogen cylinders, including locating and confirming 
the manufacture dates and certificates.  A simultaneous process was put in place 
to verify the inventory data, which was the n entered into AMOS, the planned 
maintenance system used by the fleet, to ensure there were no gaps or 
discrepancies; and  
a large number of new cylinders were sourced in anticipation of the need to carry 
out replacement  across the fleet due to the 10 -year maintenance/age 
requirement.  In total, over 800 cylinders have now been replaced.  
Further, a number of long -term policy and procedure revisions have taken place, 
reflecting an acknowledgment that the incident highlighted that there were areas 
in which exi sting procedures could be enhanced to ensure crew safety.  In 
particular, there has been a review of the planned maintenance systems, with 
the involvement of all vessels, and the AMOS work orders in relation to nitrogen 
systems on launching appliances have  been updated.  Their guidance and/or job 
descriptions now contain clear instructions regarding the dates of manufacture, 
inspection frequencies and requirements, and other relevant information.   In 
additional, AMOS has been changed to permit tracking (an d does track) each 
cylinder individually.  
Standardised guidance has been issued for nitrogen cylinder installations at LSA 
launching stations.  Because the storage and installation of the nitrogen 
cylinders in the LSA launching arrangements was found to be  a potential 
contributing factor to the onset of corrosion,  the guidance eliminates steel -to-
steel contact between all surfaces to mitigate this.  Adequate securing and 
protection, by means of Teflon pads, rubber strips or similar material is required 
to be used.  This set -up also allows for better visual inspections of the individual 
cylinders by both the crew members and approved service providers.  
[X] "Nitrogen Bottles Top Up Procedure for Hydraulic Piston Accumulators".  
Following the incident, the Group worked with [x] to sure there was one standard 
instruction available in this regard.  This document is attached to the relevant 
Fleet Maintenance Manual and a ship's Staff Chief Engineer or someone at his or 
her direction ensures that topping -up is performed, by a qualif ied Fitter, in 
accordance with the instructions that it contains each time topping -up is 
required.   
Final Report MO -2017 -203

 Safety Bulletin SB 005 -17, dated 1 August 2017, which has been issued with the 
following directions (the heightened awareness in the Technical and Safety 
Departments in relation to these systems, arising from the incident, was a 
significant factor in the production of the Bulletin):  
A risk assessment of the LSA nitrogen refilling job should be available on board.  All 
personnel assigned to this job should be  familiar with it.  
Risk assessments should be conducted for any job involving the transfer of (high 
pressure) gasses as required by OHS -1407.  
Ships should ensure that:  
For the LSA nitrogen refilling job they have the proper gas transfer kit available.  Not e 
that for all [x] systems this is in AMOS and can be found through Makers Reference: 
U01409.  
The correct gas transfer equipment is available for all similar jobs.  All recharging kits 
should be fitted with pressure reducers, gauges, and bleed valves.  Whe re not 
available, this should be ordered through the technical department.  
Standardised instructions from [x] "NITROGEN BOTTLES TOP UP PROCEDURE FOR 
HYDRAULIC PISTON ACCUMULATORS 40002 -39-099-A" must be followed during the 
LSA launching appliance rechargin g process.  
Such equipment must be kept in a controlled environment, clearly labelled and only 
used for its intended purpose.  
Work order "LSD201 - Monthly Davit inspection and turnout".  This is conducted 
by a ship's crew.  You will see that one of the goal s of the task is to " ascertain the 
physical condition of the stored -pressure systems for the launching appliances ", 
in accordance with the requirements set out.  This includes checking the 
separation of the cylinders and accumulators from steel and other m etallic 
components, to reduce contact corrosion and corrosion due to paint removal 
from abrasion.  It also includes an inspection of the external appearance of the 
cylinders, stands and securing arrangements for signs of corrosion or defect.  Any 
areas of concern are to be reported immediately to the Staff Chief Engineer and 
followed up with the ship's Technical Operations Director.  The AMOS history is 
updated following and, in the event of defects, work orders are raised.  
Work order "LSD203 - Annual inspe ctions of the LSA launching appliances by 
approved service provider".  As you know, this is conducted generally by [x].  The 
details of this work order have been amended.  It now requires full isolation of 
each system so that there can be a full inspection  of each cylinder and its 
connections.  The external surface of each cylinder is cleaned thoroughly and 
then inspected for any defects.  Serial numbers and manufacture dates are 
verified and checked against on -board records to ensure the cylinders are with in 
their 10 year lifespan.  The findings of the inspections are required to be 
recorded in the service provider's report.  An example [x] inspection/service 
report from July 2017, containing detailed information about nitrogen cylinders, 
is also attached. Any findings of significance are recorded in AMOS and the 
vessel's Technical Operations Director is notified.  Where a specific item of work 
needs to be performed on the system, it will be noted in AMOS and a work order 
raised.  
Work order "PAT0039 - 10 yea r replacement of cylinders".  This requires that 
Nitrogen cylinders (and bladder -type accumulators in the LSA launching 
appliance systems) are to be replaced on or before the 10 year anniversary of 
manufacture17.  Relatedly, the system of monitoring or trac king cylinder age and 
condition in AMOS has been changed.  The previous system involved collective 
monitoring, based on cylinder installation date.  As above, cylinders are now 
individually tracked in AMOS based on their manufacture date.  This is reflecte d 
in the work order, which provides that when new cylinders are installed, the 
"MANUFACTURE date (stamped on the collar of the cylinder…) and NOT the 
installation date must be entered within Amos and on -board records… "  
                                                        
17  These are the changes that have been implemented.  We note further that the Group is also looking to 
move to a 90 -month (i.e. 7.5 -year) replacement frequency for nitrogen cylinders.

 Work order "PAT0040 - 10 year overha ul and test of piston -type accumulators".  
This job has been added to ensure these accumulators undergo a full overhaul 
(including dismantling, replacement of seals and full internal and external 
inspection) and a system test every 10 years.  Where possibl e, these units are 
also returned to the vessel with galvanic protection against corrosion.   
1.1. Since the accident , the davit manufacturer  has taken the following safety actions:  
In order to improve the training of our service technicians, they have been 
supp lementary instructed with "Additional guidance for the inspection of nitrogen 
cylinders ", see attached internal document CN10/17 . 
In order to improve the documentation provided, the refilling procedure has been 
amended by adding some precautions and distributed to our customers and 
technicians.  
If not otherwise required by the Flag State of the ship, our "recommendation " is 
that any nitrogen cylinder deemed unfit due to corrosion should be removed for 
further assessment and, if more than 10 years have  elapsed since initial 
pressure test at manufacture facility, the cylinder must be hydrostatic pressure 
tested .

 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , new recommendations have been issued to the manufacturer and the 
Director of Maritime New Zealand.  
8.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety , it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or inciden ts occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Early  recommendation s 
To the manufacturer:  
8.2.1.  The nitrogen cylinders that formed part of the stored  energy alternative launching system on 
board the Emerald Princess  were stowed in a harsh marine environment and had significant 
external visible corrosion.  
The nitrogen cylinder burst as a result of overload in the area of corrosion thinning.  
The circumstances of this accident raise the question of whether the current inspection 
requirements for a competent person are adequate for a  pressure vessel stored in a harsh 
marine environment.  
The nitrogen cylinders were inspected annually by the manufacturer's authorised 
representative, and the most recent inspection was two weeks prior to the accident. On each 
occasion the cylinders were found in satisfactory working condition. The Commission is 
concerned that there might be other pressure vessels part of the same system or similar 
systems that could pose a significant danger to seafarers and passengers.  
On 10 April 2017 the Commission recommended to the manufacturer that, as a matter of 
urgency, it contact all known ship owners that have the same or similar emergency launching 
and recovery systems installed on their vessels, informing them about the circumstances of 
this accident, and a dvising them to have the systems inspected immediately by a competent 
person to check whether the nitrogen cylinders and other pressure vessels associated with the 
systems are fit for purpose.  Any nitrogen cylinders deemed unfit due to corrosion should be  
removed for further assessment.  (010/17 ) 
8.2.2.  On 21 April 2017 the manufacturer  replied in part:  
We shall highlight that the interim report does not reflect that our last service 
intervention commented that, even if the launching appliance was in satisfactory  
working condition, the nitrogen bottles were reported aged and consequently 
recommended replacement.  
As per your recommendation, please be informed that we are promptly 
contact ing all our  customers having the same or similar equipment on board and 
our ser vice networks is following up to support our customers in this dedicated 
inspection. Any nitrogen cylinder deemed unfit due to corrosion will be required 
to be removed for further assessment.  
Recommendation to the International Association of Classificatio n Societies  
8.2.3.  The nitrogen cylinders that formed part of the stored  energy alternative launching system on 
board the Emerald Princess  were stowed in a harsh marine environment and had significant 
external visible corrosion.  
The nitrogen cylinder burst as a r esult of overload caused by corrosion thinning.

 On 10 April 2017 the Commission recommended to the Director of Maritime New Zealand that 
all New Zealand surveyors and port s tate control officers be informed about the circumstances 
of this accident and advise them to pay special attention to any corroded nitrogen cylinders or 
other pressure vessels when conducting their Class or Flag State surveys, particularly when 
inspecting  pressure vessels stored in an open marine environment.  (013/17)  
8.2.8.  On 20 April 2017 Maritime New Zealand replied:  
On 20 April 2017, Maritime New Zealand issued Safety Bulletin 34 to all New 
Zealand Surveyors and Port State Control Officers, trainee Port Sta te Control 
Officers, Maritime Officers and their respective managers.  This bulletin will also 
be posted on Maritime New Zealand's public website - 
http://www.m aritimenz.govt.nz/commercial/safety/safety -updates/safety -
bulletins  
8.3. New r ecommendations  
To the manufacturer  
8.3.1.  The nitrogen cylinders that formed part of the stored  energy system on board the Emerald 
Princess  were stowed in a harsh marine environment and had significant external corrosion . 
The nitrogen cylinders were inspected annually by the manufacturer's authorised technician .  
The most recent inspection was two weeks prior to the accident. On each occasion the 
cylinders were judged to be in satisfactory working condition.  
The circumstances of this accident raise the question of whether the current training 
requirements for autho rised technicians  are adequate for a pressure vessel stored in a harsh 
marine environment.  
On 22 November  2018 the Commission recommended that the manufacturer carry out a 
review of its current training processes and ensure that inspection s of stored ener gy systems 
are carried out by technicians who are trained and certified to inspect them.  (029/18)  
8.3.2.  On 12 December 2018, the manufacturer replied:  
The accident highlighted the need to pay extra attention to all pressured gas 
cylinders/bottles that, exposed t o harsh marine environment (and, sometimes, 
installed in difficult to reach positions) could experience localized corrosion not 
easily detected.  Therefore, being the safety of human life at sea the core itself of our 
activity, we already took immediate ac tions in two ways:  
1. We issued a circular letter to ALL involved shipowners in our data base 
recommending the immediate and thorough inspection of all cylinders on 
board their fleets and proposing unconditional replacement of all cylinders 
older than ten yea rs (in respect to manufacturing date);  
2. We released an internal bulletin providing to our technical personnel 
specific instructions on how to improve the level of examination on 
nitrogen cylinders and, in particular, on how to recognize heavy signs of 
corrosion and other evident damage.  
It must be also stressed that the accident acutely made evident that a vacuum in the 
actual marine norms and regulations does exist. It is our firm conviction that a 
coordinate action by Flags administrations, international marine regulation bodies, 
naval registers as well as shipowners associations will be necessary to fill the current 
vacuum in order to avoid too much personal interpretation in this delicate; if not 
feasible to quickly develop specific marine rules, ashore heavy industry standards 
could be used as a pattern.

 To the Director of Maritime New Zealand  
8.3.3.  The cylinder failed at below its normal working pressure because severe external corrosion 
had reduced the wall thickness from 4.81  mm to 1.45  mm (about 30% of its original 
thickness).  
The failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders within the stored energy 
system were not fit for purpose and should not have been in service.  
There is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards to be devel oped at a global level 
for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, replacing high-pressure  cylinders 
associated with stored energy systems on board ships.  
Under the applicable IMO requirements, the stored energy systems were to be examined 
annually for "satisfactory condition and operation "; however , the IMO did not provide any 
recommended minimum standards  for the inspection , testing and rejection  of pressure 
vessels that were  part of a stored energy system .  This resulted in different flag states having 
different minimum requirements for ensur ing that  pressure vessels  remain ed in 'satisfactory 
condition'.  Some flag states had no  minimum testing and rejection requirements for  pressure 
vessels associated with stored energy system s. 
On 22 Nove mber  2018  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand raise through the appropriate International Maritime Organi zation safety committee 
for its consideration, the implications for maritime  safety  of not having  adequate minimum 
standards for the inspection , testing and rejection of  pressure vessels that are part of a stored 
energy system .  (030/18)  
8.3.4.  On 7 December 2018  Maritime New Zealand replied  in part : 
To address the recommendation Maritime New Zealand intends to raise the 
issue with the relevant IMO body as soon as practicable, whether this is the 
Maritime Safety Committee, or one of its technical sub -committees. Once we are 
in a position to do so we will also ensure that New Zealand delegations to 
relevant IMO meetings are bri efed to support work on the issue being 
progressed.

 9. Key l esson  
9.1. Any sign of corrosion on high-pressure  cylinders should be fully investigated by a person 
competent in examining high-pressure  cylinders  before any remedial work is undertaken and 
the cylinder s are allowed back into service .
