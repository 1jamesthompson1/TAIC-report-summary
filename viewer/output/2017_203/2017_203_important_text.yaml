  \ are widely used on  board ships for various applications .  Their  failure can\
  \ be \ncatastrophic and may result  in human injury and death , as was the case\
  \ on board  the Emerald \nPrincess .  \n4.1.2.  The crew were follow ing the correct\
  \ procedure for recharging the nitrogen cylinders when the \ncylinder burst.  The\
  \ failed cylinder was one of four located at lifeboat station No.  24 and had \n\
  very little to no protection from sea spray.  The cylinder was severely weakened\
  \ by corrosion , \nwhich caused it to fail under normal working loads .  The shipboard\
  \ maintenance plan and the \nvarious inspection regimes that gave effect to that\
  \ plan did not detect or remedy the issue \nbefore the failure occurred.  T he cylinder\
  \ that failed was  overdue for maintenance  and testing,  \nand should not have\
  \ been in service at the time of the accident.  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis\
  \ discusses why the nitrogen cylinder  remain ed in service despite being in \n\
  a danger ous condition .  The analysis raise s the following two safety issues :\
  \ \n\uF0B7 there are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing\
  \ and rejection \nof pressure cylinders that make up part of stored e nergy systems\
  \ on lifeboat launching \ninstallations, which has resulted in a wide variation\
  \ in, and in some case inadequate, \nstandards applied by flag state administrations,\
  \ classification societies and authorised \nservice providers  \n\uF0B7 technicians\
  \ who are author ised to conduct mandatory annual and five -yearly inspections \n\
  of lifeboat -launching installations are not required to have specific training\
  \ and \ncertification for inspecting any stored energy -release systems and their\
  \ associated \npressure cylinders.  \n4.2. Why did the cylinder burst?  \n4.2.1.\
  \  The cylinder burst because a region of severe corrosion reduced the cylinder\
  \ wall thickness \nfrom about 4.81  mm to 1.45  mm and significantly compromised\
  \ the cylinder's ability to \nwithstand internal pressure.  As a result, the cylinder\
  \ su ffered an overpressure burst while the \ncrew attempted to raise the nitrogen\
  \ pressure from 160 bar to its normal working pressure of \n200 bar.  \n4.2.2. \
  \ There is no clear evidence as to why this particular cylinder was so heavily corroded\
  \ in the \narea where the failure  started.  The adjacent cylinders in the frame\
  \ were not heavily corroded. \nCorrosion can be initiated by a number of factors.\
  \  Mechanical damage to the protective \ncoating in a saltwater environment is a\
  \ common cause.  Seawater being trapped against a \nsteel surface can accelerate\
  \ corrosion.  The straps that retained the bottles in the frame is a \nplace where\
  \ seawater could have become trapped.  They could also  have  initiate d mechanical\
  \ \ndamage to the protective coating.  However, as Figure 15 shows, the locatio\
  \ n where the worst \ncorrosion occurred was not where the straps were in contact\
  \ with the bottles.  \n4.2.3.  There was no evidence of any pre -existing crack\
  \ occurring before the failure.  The source of \nthe leak in the system that the\
  \ crew were trying to remedy was neve r found.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -203\
  \ \n<< Page 18 >>\n  \nFigure 15 \nLocation of burst on failed cylinder  \n4.3.\
  \ On-board maintenance and inspection of pressure vessels  \nMaintenance   \n4.3.1.\
  \  The maintenance schedule for nitrogen cylinders and accumulators  was calendar\
  \ based .  That \nis, time was the trigger for the various inspections and test\
  \ s.  Weekly and monthly routines \nwere carried out by the crew , while major maintenance\
  \ work such as h ydrostatic pressure \ntesting of nitrogen cylinders  was designated\
  \ to an authorised service provider  or sh ore-based \ntesting facility . \n4.3.2.\
  \  Hydrostatic pressure testing is a standard method of pressure testing cylinders.\
  \  It involves \nfilling a cylinder with water and pressuris ing it up to 1.5 times\
  \ its design pressure limit.  The \npressure is then held for a prescribed amount\
  \ of time and the cylinder is  then  inspected for \nleaks.  \n4.3.3.  The maintenance\
  \ regime on board the Emerald Princess  was kept in a  computer -based \nmaintenance\
  \  system.  \n4.3.4.  The hydrostatic pressure testing of nitrogen cyli nders was\
  \ scheduled to have been carried out \nevery 10 years , starting from the date they\
  \ were  first h ydrostatically pressure tested. H owever, \nthe start date entered\
  \ into the maintenance plan was May 2007,  which was  the date that the \nnitrogen\
  \ cylinders were installed on the vessel during b uild.  However, the  cylinder\
  \ that failed  \nhad been  manufactured in September 2005, which was when it was\
  \ first pressure tested.  \nTherefore , it was overdue for testing by one  year\
  \ and five  months at the time of the accident.  \nThe operator has now addressed\
  \ this issue and updated its maintenance plan so that it tracks \nthe age of each\
  \ cylinder based on  its manufacture date , rather than its installation date .\
  \ \n\nFinal Report MO -2017 -203 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.3.5.  If the failed bottle\
  \ had been inspected and tested by a competent author ity 17 months earlier, \n\
  it is very likely that it would have been condemned and the accident avoided . \
  \ The depth of the \ncorrosion in the cylinder wall was such that it almost certainly\
  \ would have been prevalent 17 \nmonths earlier.  \n4.3.6.  Ten years is a long\
  \ time be tween testing, particularly for cylinders that are exposed to a \nseawater\
  \ environment.  Authorities might need to consider reducing this period in some\
  \ \ncircumstances, or at least having a more rigorous inspection regime to detect\
  \ any early onset \nof corrosio n. \n4.3.7.  Other options could include the use\
  \ of better coating and steel protection systems for steel \nbottles, such as galvanising.\
  \  \nInspection  \n4.3.8.  The deck team and engineering team maintained the lifeboat\
  \ launching equipment .  Both \nteams inspect ed the nitr ogen cyl inders and accumulators\
  \  with different  objectives .  The deck \nteam's work was cosmetic -focused .\
  \  The engineering team 's work was more condition -based.  \nThey were inspect\
  \ ing the accumulators and nitrogen cylinders for condition and operational \nreliability.\
  \  \n4.3.9.  The deck  team carried out visual inspec tions of the nitrogen cylinders\
  \ , and any signs of rust \nwere  scrap ed off with scrap ers and painted  over.\
  \  Due to the cosmetic nature of this work it \nwas not log ged as a matter of record.\
  \   Paint can mask a potential pro blem area.  If , for \nexample, a steel surface\
  \ is not properly treated prior to painting, coating the area with fresh \npaint\
  \ can mask a problem area, and in the worst case salt can be come  trapped under\
  \ the \npaint and accelerate rather than slow the corrosion process.  \n4.3.10.\
  \  Any sign of corrosion on a pressure cylinder is cause for concern , and for that\
  \ reason the \ntreatment of that corrosion should be preceded by a thorough inspection\
  \ by a person \ncompetent in assessing the pressure cylinder's fitness for purpose.\
  \  \n4.4. Inspection standards  \nSafety issue: There are currently no global  minimum\
  \ standards for the inspection, testing and \nrejection of pressure cylinders that\
  \ make up part of stored energy system s on lifeboat \nlaunching installations,\
  \ which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some cases \ninadequate, standards\
  \ applied by  flag state administrations, classification societies and \nauthorised\
  \ service providers . \nInternational Maritime Organi zation : Resolution MSC .402(96)\
  \ \n4.4.1.  The IMO has taken a number of steps to address  fatal accidents  involving\
  \ lifeboats and \nassociated equipment.  The IMO noted that one of the reasons for\
  \ these accidents was the \ninadequate maintenance of lifeboats,  davits and launching\
  \ equipment.  As a result , in May \n2016  the IMO adopted resolution MSC .402(96)\
  \ , which set out to establish a uniform and safe \ninspection regime for lifeboats\
  \ and their launching appliances , while also ensuring that the \npersonnel carrying\
  \  out these inspections were  authorised and certified to do so.  This \nmandatory\
  \ resolution will come into force on 1 January 2020 , but existed as guideline s15\
  \ at \nthe time of the accident.  \n4.4.2.  The resolution state d that weekly and\
  \ monthly  inspections of launching  appliances could  be \ncarried out by shipboard\
  \ personnel under the direction of a senior ship's officer .  However, it \nalso\
  \ state d that annual and five -yearly inspections  and operational  tests should\
  \  be carried out  \nby certified person nel representing the  manufacturer or an\
  \ authori sed service provider.   \n                                           \
  \             \n15 MSC. 1/Circ.1206. Rev.1, Measures to Prevent Accidents  with\
  \ Lifeboats and MSC.1/Circ.1277, Interim \nRecommendation on Conditions for Authorisation\
  \ of Service Providers for Lifeboats, Launching Appliances \nand On -Load Release\
  \ Gear.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -203 \n<< Page 20 >>\n 4.4.3.  The resolution\
  \  also described in detail the examinations and operational tests that should \
  \ be \nperformed on lifeboats, launching appliances and on -load release gear. \
  \  \nStored energy system  not included  \n4.4.4.  Under the applicable guidelines,\
  \ stored energy systems were to be examined annually for \n'satisfactory condition\
  \ and operation '; however, neither the guidelines nor the new resolution \nprovide\
  \ d any recommended  minimum 'maintenance and inspection ' standards to ensure that\
  \ \nthe stored energy system was in a \"satisfactory condition and operation \"\
  . \n4.4.5.  The IMO provide d guidelines on the  recommended minimum standards for\
  \ the inspection, \ntesting and rejection of similar pressure cylinders on board\
  \ ships , for example carbon dioxide \ncylinders that form part of a fixed carbon\
  \ dioxide  fire-extinguishing  system , and oxygen \ncylinders that form part of\
  \ self -contained breathing apparatus .  These  guidelines were \nintended to supplement\
  \  the manufacturers ' approved maintenance  instructions while \nproviding  a common\
  \ minimum standard across the maritime industry  for the maintenance and \ninspection\
  \ of these pressure cylinders . \n4.4.6.  The other cylinders described  above are\
  \ typically installed or kept in locations protected from \nsalt water  environment\
  \ s.  Stored energy systems , on the other hand , are usually located on  \nsheltered\
  \ or open decks, yet there are no overarching standards for examining and testing\
  \ \nthem.  \n4.4.7.  Standards for i nspection, testing and rejecti ng nitrogen\
  \ cylinders and accumulato rs, if any , are \nlimited to those imposed by vessels\
  \ ' flag state s16. The inspection standards vary greatly  \nbetween different flag\
  \ state administrations .  For example, some flag states require that \nnitrogen\
  \ cylinders be removed from vessel s and hydrostatically tested every 10 years ,\
  \ while \nothers  do not.   \n4.4.8.  A further consideration for the maintenance\
  \ of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators is that \ntheir condition may not necessarily\
  \ be time bound.  A n authorised service provider observed \nthat the condition\
  \  of nitrogen cylinders and accumulators  varied across vessels.   Sometimes \n\
  six-year-old pressure cylinders were observed  to be severely corroded and deemed\
  \ not fit for \npurpose, while on other ships 15-year-old pressure cylinders were\
  \  found to be  in good \ncondition and fit for purpose.   This variation in condition\
  \ may be attributed to a number of \nfactors , such as the vessels ' trading route\
  \ s, the location s of the cylinders , the on -board \nmaintenance regime s and\
  \ the standard s of inspection . \n4.4.9.  A lack of guidelines or recommended minimum\
  \ standards for the inspection, testing and \nrejection of nitrogen cylinders and\
  \ accumulators meant  that authorised service provide rs, \nclassification societies\
  \ and flag state administrations were unable to apply a c ommon \napproach and carry\
  \ out inspect ions based on a common  minimum standard.  \n4.5. Training and certification\
  \  \nSafety issue: Technician s who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and\
  \ five -yearly \ninspections of lifeboat -launching installations are not require\
  \ d to have  specific training and \ncertification  for inspecting any stored energy\
  \ -release systems and their associated pressure \ncylinders . \n4.5.1.  MSC .402(96)\
  \ set the conditions for  the authorisation  of service providers .  This was  to\
  \ ensure \nthat the testing and inspection of lifeboats, launching appliances and\
  \ on -load release  gear \nwere  carried out in accordance with SOLAS Chapter III,\
  \ regulation 20 .  \n4.5.2.  Further, the technicians carrying out the annual and\
  \ five -yearly inspections of li feboats, \nlaunching appliances and on -load release\
  \ gear were  to be certified by the manufacture r or \n                        \
  \                                \n16 A flag state may impose regula tions over\
  \ and above the mandatory standards prescribed by the IMO.  For \nexample, although\
  \ the IMO did not require the nitrogen cylinders to be hydrostatically pressure\
  \ tested every \n10 years, Bermuda, the Emerald Princess 's flag state, required\
  \ the vessel to comply with this requirement.  \nFinal Report MO -2017 -203 \n<<\
  \ Page 21 >>\n authori sed service provider  for each make and type of equipment\
  \  that was required to  be \ninspected .  \n4.5.3.  The technicians were required\
  \ to complete education, trai ning and competence assessment s \nbefore being allowed\
  \ to carry out any such inspection.   As a minimum  the education  included \nthe\
  \ relevant rules and regulations, design and construction of lif eboats and launching\
  \ \nappliances.   \n4.5.4.  The technicians ' training  includ ed procedures for\
  \ examin ing, test ing, operat ing and repair ing \nlifeboats and their launching\
  \ appliances .  However,  it did not include any specialised training \nin and certification\
  \ for the inspection of any associated pressure  cylinders .  There was no \nregulatory\
  \ requirement  to have th ese.  \n4.5.5.  The authorised  technician  who carried\
  \ out the five -yearly inspection of the accumulator and \nnitrogen cylinders on\
  \ board the Emerald Princess , just prior to the accident, noted that the \nnitrogen\
  \ cylinders  should  be considered  for replacement .  The technician was not to\
  \ know that \non the cylinder that failed , corrosion had reduced the wall thickness\
  \ at the fracture -initiation \nregion to about 30% of the original thickness .\
  \  Formal training in the assessment of pressure \ncylinders would have better prepared\
  \ the technician to determine  that the cylinder was not fit \nfor purpose  and\
  \ posed a serious safety risk . \n4.5.6.  The metallurgist  who examined the nitrogen\
  \ cylinders and accumulators installed on the \nEmerald Princess  was experienced\
  \ in assessing the condition of pressure cylinders.  The \nmetallurgist noted that\
  \ corrosion was present on foot rings  fitted  on a number of nitrogen \ncylinders\
  \ , especially w here they were in contact with the support frame.  \n4.5.7.  The\
  \ metallurgist also noted that the accumulator  at lifeboat station  Nos. 24 and\
  \ 25 was \n\"obviously  bulged as a result of the build -up of corrosion  products\
  \ under the paint and under \nthe support strap \".  The metallurgist's assessment\
  \ was that at least two accumulators  on \nboard th e Emerald Princess  should \
  \ have been cond emned as unsafe to operat e.   \n4.5.8.  Nitrogen cylinders and\
  \ accumulators are high-pressure  vessels  often exposed to harsh marine \nenvironment\
  \ s.  There would  be significant safety benefit s from their being  inspected by\
  \ \nperson s trained and experience d in the inspection of pressure vessels . \n\
