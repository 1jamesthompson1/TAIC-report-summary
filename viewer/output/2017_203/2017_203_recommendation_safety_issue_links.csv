2017_203,030/18,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand raise through the appropriate International Maritime Organization safety committee for its consideration, the implications for maritime safety of not having adequate minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure vessels that are part of a stored energy system.","The cylinder failed at below its normal working pressure because severe external corrosion had reduced the wall thickness from 4.81 mm to 1.45 mm (about 30% of its original thickness).

The failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders within the stored energy system were not fit for purpose and should not have been in service.

There is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards to be developed at a global level for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, replacing high-pressure cylinders associated with stored energy systems on board ships.

Under the applicable IMO requirements, the stored energy systems were to be examined annually for â€œsatisfactory condition and operationâ€; however, the IMO did not provide any recommended minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure vessels that were part of a stored energy system. This resulted in different flag states having different minimum requirements for ensuring that pressure vessels remained in â€˜satisfactory conditionâ€™. Some flag states had no minimum testing and rejection requirements for pressure vessels associated with stored energy systems.

On 22 November 2018 ","There are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy systems on lifeboat launching installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some case inadequate, standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised service providers.

2017_203,029/18,the Commission recommended that the manufacturer carry out a review of its current training processes and ensure that inspections of stored energy systems are carried out by technicians who are trained and certified to inspect them.,"The nitrogen cylinders that formed part of the stored energy system on board the Emerald Princess were stowed in a harsh marine environment and had significant external corrosion.

The nitrogen cylinders were inspected annually by the manufacturerâ€™s authorised technician. The most recent inspection was two weeks prior to the accident. On each occasion the cylinders were judged to be in satisfactory working condition.

The circumstances of this accident raise the question of whether the current training requirements for authorised technicians are adequate for a pressure vessel stored in a harsh marine environment.
