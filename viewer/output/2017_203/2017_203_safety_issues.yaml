- There are currently no global minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure cylinders that make up part of stored energy systems on lifeboat launching installations, which has resulted in a wide variation in, and in some cases inadequate, standards applied by flag state administrations, classification societies and authorised service providers.
- Technicians who are authorised to conduct mandatory annual and five-yearly inspections of lifeboat-launching installations are not required to have specific training and certification for inspecting any stored energy-release systems and their associated pressure cylinders.
