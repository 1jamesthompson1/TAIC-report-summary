No repeat accidents – ever!  
“The principal purpose of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) shall be to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding 
similar occurrences in the future, rather than to ascribe blame to any person.”  
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
 
The Transport Accident Investigat ion Commission is an independent Crown entity and 
standing commission of inquiry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents that occur in New Zealand or involve New Zealand -registered aircraft or 
vessels.  
Our investigatio ns are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve safety. Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue c riminal, civil, or regulatory action.  
At the end of every inquiry, we share all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve safety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions  
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where p ossible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Inte rgovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The Commission 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functio ns include making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive summary  
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto  
What happened  
1.1 On 2 July 2021 , the factory fishing trawler Amaltal Enterprise  was fishing off the w est 
coast of the South Island, New Zealand.  The main engine had been shut down to effect 
repairs to a low -pressure fuel pipe. About 50 minutes after resta rt, an accumulator 
installed in the main engine low-pressure fuel system unwound and dislodged from its 
pipe connector , allowing marine diesel oil at 8 bar pressure to jet upwards and ignite 
on the shrouded hot engine exhaust  manifold . 
1.2 The crew closed down the engine room and the fire was quickly brought under control 
without the use of the fixed Halon1 gaseous  fire-smothering system. The vessel 
suffered extensive heat and smoke damage to electrical systems  and had to be towed 
to a safe port for repair.  
Why it happened  
1.3 It is likely  the accumulator dislodged due to any combination of the following factors . 
• A lower -than-optimal torque being applied when fitting the connector into the 
accumulator  during maintenance conducted  approximately five weeks earlier  by 
shore -based contractors . 
• Vibration and resonance created by the machinery and propulsion system in the 
engine room . 
• The ‘loose fit’ between the male thread on the connector and the female thread of 
the accumulator. Once the steel -on-steel connection between the two components 
was lost, lateral play between the two made the assembly more prone to vibration 
and afforded little resistance to the accumulator unwinding . 
• The failure of the bladder within the accumulator meant the assembly was 
susceptible to pressure pulsin g within the fuel system rather than achieving its 
purpose of absorbing these forces . 
1.4 There was no support bracket or any other means of preventing the accumulator from 
dislodging . 
What we can learn  
1.5 It is important that repair and maintenance is performed under controlled conditions, 
such as following appropriate procedures for tagging out, checking, testing and 
signing off each task, particularly when working on safety -critical systems.  
1.6 Forced and resonant vibration in engine rooms can be problematic. It i s important that 
components are secured against vibration to  guard against the loosening, chaf e or 
wearing, cracking and (in extreme cases ) destruction of components, particularly 
safety -critical components.

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  1.7 It is important that devices  for disconnecting  systems remotely  are routinely tested to 
ensure that they function correctly during an emergency.  
1.8 When responding to an emergency , it is important that crew fully consider  the 
important elements of command and control , specifically , accounting for all crew  and 
establishing good communications.  
1.9 When a vessel has a fixed gaseous fire -extinguishing system , where the gas and 
associated release mechanisms are located in the space they are designed to protect, it 
is important that crew understand the longer they d elay activation the higher the risk 
that fire will render these systems partially or fully inoperable .

 2 Factual information   
Pārongo pono  
Narrative  
2.1 On 26 May 2021, t he Amaltal Enterprise  departed Dunedin  with 4 4 crew members and 
one observer from the Mi nistry for Primary Industr ies on board  and headed south to 
the sub -Antarctic Islands . Over the following 25 days the vessel fished in the area of 
the sub -Antarct ic Islands before headin g north up the w est coast of the South Island 
to fish for species there.  
2.2 On 20 June 2021 , the chief engineer was making rounds of the engine room when he 
noticed diesel oil  leaking from a fractured  pipe on the main engine low -pressure fuel 
system .2 The engine was shut down and the leaking fuel pipe removed . A fitter 
repaired the  fuel pipe , and it was reinstalled, after which the vessel resumed fishing 
operations.  
2.3 After a further 12 days, at about 1 345 on Friday 2 July 2021, the chief engineer notice d 
diesel oil leaking from the repaired pipe in the same fuel line. The Amaltal Enterprise  
was trawling for fish at that time  about 55 nautical miles west of Hokitika , West Coast . 
The skipper hauled the nets and at about 1410  the chie f engineer shut down the main 
engine . The leaking fuel pipe was removed and the same fitter effected a more 
permanent repair by welding a doubler3 plate around  the crack.  
2.4 By 1505 , the engine crew had made  the repair , refitted the fuel pipe , cleaned the 
affected area and pressurised the fuel system  to check for leaks in the area. Finding no 
leaks , the chief engineer restarted the main engine at 1515 . 
2.5 At 1516 , the chief engineer engaged the main engine shaft generator and monitored  
the engine room for a perio d of time before leaving it for the workshop one deck 
above. The skipper began casting  the nets to resume trawling . The weather was fine 
and clear with light winds and a slight sea running . 
2.6 At 1625 , the engine room alarm sounded . The chief engineer left the workshop and, on 
descend ing the engine room  stairs , saw flames near the forward left -hand side of the 
main engine  (see figure 3). The chief engineer decided to not risk trying to reach the 
engine control room where the emergency stops were located , but instead  retreated  
back up the stairs . At that time t he main engine stopped and the vessel blacked out.4 
The chief engineer chanced on  the deck watchkeeper  at the top of the stairs and tol d 
them to go to the bridge and report the fire to the skipper.  
2.7 Meanwhile , on the bridge the skipper had noti ced the main engine had stopped and, 
looking aft , saw thick black  smoke coming from vents in the starboard gantry leg, 
which also doubled as the exhaust  trunking for the main engine.  The main fire alarm 
had not sounded , so at about the same time as the deck watchman arrived on the 
bridge to report the fire the skipper m anually activated the general fire alarm.  
 
2 The low -pressure fuel system typically operated at 8 bar pressure  or 800 kilo pascals . Unit of pressure – 1 bar is 
equal to 100 kilopascals  (SI metric unit)  
3 Another stee l plate is welded directly over the existing steel plate to e ncompass the crack . 
4 Lost electrical power to all systems due to the main shaft generator no longer being driven by the main engine.

skipper’s view from bridge looking aft (right)  
 
2.8 With the loss of the main engine the Amaltal Enterprise  stopped and the trawl nets 
settled onto the seabed, effectively anchoring the vessel in the calm sea conditions.  
Response to the fire 
2.9 The chief engineer  closed the dampers5 for the two e ngine room supply fans located 
on the port side of the trawl gantry. While the chief engineer  was crossing the deck to 
close the exhaust vents on the starboard side, the emergency generator started up 
automaticall y. 
2.10 The chief engineer then tried to close the damper on the starboard No. 2 engine room 
exhaust fan, but it was running and thick smoke emanating from it made it impossible 
to close.  
2.11 The chief engineer then went to the bridge and asked the skipper to activate the three 
emergency stops on the bridge , which : 
• shut down systems associated  with the main engine  
• stopped the accommodation ventilation fans 
• opened the breakers on the main switch board that powered the main engine 
fuel pumps and other ancillary  equipment.  
2.12 The chief engineer then returned to the main deck and succeeded in shutting the 
damper on the engine room exhaust fan, even though  it was still running.

 2.13 The chief engineer then re turned to the bridge and opened the door to the release  
cabinet for the engine room fixed  Halon gas eous fire -smothering system.  The purpose 
of doing this was to trigger an automatic stop connected to the cabinet door that 
would automatically stop the No. 2 exhaust fan . However, t he fan continued running , 
so the chief engineer went to the emergency generator distribution panel and tripped 
the circuit breaker for th e No.  2 exhaust fan, which caused the fan to stop.  
2.14 The chief engineer then went to the bosun store6 and activated the remote fuel shut -
off valves, which isolated all fuel supply to the main engine . 
2.15 Meanwhile, in response to the general fire alarm , the cre w had mustered at their fire  
stations  and carried out the following tasks:  
• started the emergency fire pump  
• donned self-contained breathing apparatus  (BA) 
• ran fire hoses  in preparation for boundary cooling . 
2.16 By about 1 640,7 the crew observed that the smoke emitting fr om the engine room had 
decreased in volume and was lighter in colour. Believing that the fire had likely been 
smothered at that point, the skipper and chief engineer decided not to activate the 
fixed Halon gas eous fire -smothering system for the engine room  and instead 
instructed the BA team of two to enter the engine room to conduct  an inspection.  
2.17 Upon entry t he BA team observed ‘a lot of smoke ’ but could see no flames. They were 
able to relay this information to the other parties through the radio integrated into the 
BA facemasks. They then retreated  and shortly after re -entered with a portable foam 
applicator and spread foam over much of the engine room. The BA team then 
retreated and the engine room was closed up again by about 1705 . 
2.18 At 17 35, the chief engineer together with the BA team re -entered the engine room . 
They observed a residual ‘haze’ but no fire. The chief engineer iso lated a  number of 
systems that had been damaged by fire and then they retreated, leaving the engine 
room closed for a further hour.  
2.19 At 1825 , the chief engineer closed8 the breakers on the engine room fans and began 
ventilating the engine room.  At about 1915, the skipper , chief engineer  and second 
mate entered the engine room  to assess the damage.  
2.20 At about 2000 , the skipper and chief engineer re -entered the engine room to 
investigate the cause of the fire. They found that an accumulator9 that should have 
been connected  near the  low-pressure fuel filter arrangement had separated from its 
fuel line and was lying on the tank top10 below . They arranged for the open fuel line 
where the accumulator had been connected  to be capped and then retreated to the 
bridge to plan next steps.  
2.21 Previously, the skipper had telephoned  Talley’s technical manager and told them about  
the fire. In this subsequent discussion with management ashore they decided that it 
was not feasible to  make the main engine operational , so it was decided that another

Nelson.  
2.22 By 1520 the following day , 3 July 2021, another company vessel had the Amaltal 
Enterprise  in tow . With out the use of the main  engine -driven shaft generator  there was 
insufficient generator capacity to operate the trawl winches,  so the trawl nets were 
severed and dropped to the seabed for later retrieval.  At about 1500 on 5 July 2021, 
the tow had arrived off Nelson, where a Port of Nelson pilot boarded and (with the 
assistance of the harbour tugs ) the Amaltal Enterprise  was taken into the port.  
Key personnel  information  
2.23 The skipper joined Talley ’s as a fishing deck hand in 1994 and  has remained working for 
the company  for 27 years . The skipper obtained fishing certificates and worked through 
the ranks  on a number  of Talley’s fishing vessels , being promoted to first mate in about 
2006 , then transfe rring  to the Amaltal Enterprise  in about 2009 . The skipper obtained 
his Skipper Fishing Vessel Unlimited Certificate in March 2019 and  was given their first 
command i n 2020 . The skipper  was on the third trip as skipper at the time of the fire.  
2.24 At the time of the accident t he chief engineer had worked for Talley’s for about 1 1 
years  (as a trainee engineer  for about six months , as second  engineer for about five-
and-a-half years and chief engineer for the last four-and-a-half years ). The chief 
engineer ’s experience on the Amaltal Enterprise  included nearly five years as second  
engineer and the four-and-a-half years as chief engineer.  The chief engineer  obtained  
a Marine Engineering Class 3 Certificate (MEC3) in October 20 16, which was valid for 
ships with a main engine rating of up to 3000 kilowatts  within New Zealand waters .11  
2.25 The second engineer  had started with Talley’s as a trainee engineer in 2015. The 
second engineer obtained a Marine Engineer Certificate Class 5 (MEC5) in April 2018 
and was soon after promoted to second engineer  on another company vessel before 
transferring to the Amaltal Enterprise  later that year . 
2.26 The second engineer had completed a  Basic Firefighti ng Course and both the skipper 
and chief engineer had completed an Advanced Fire fighting course.  
2.27 The skipper, chief engineer and second engineer all joined the Amaltal Enterprise  at 
the start of the voyage in Dunedin on 25 May, about five weeks before the fire. All 
three held the appropriate qualification for their respective ranks on board for the 
accident trip.  
Vessel information  
2.28 The Amaltal Enterprise  is a New Zealand -registered  deep -sea factory fishing trawler . 
Species are caught, processed , packaged and frozen on board.  It typically operates 
with a total crew of between 40 and 45 , most  of whom  are employed working the 
various processing plant s on board.  
2.29 The vessel was built in 1988 in Norway. It first entered the New Zealand ship reg istry in 
2000 and was purchased by Talley’s in 2002.  
2.30 Main propulsion is provided by a single 3000  kilowatt  Wartsila Vasa diesel engine , 
which also provides power for  a shaft -driven main  generator. A Cummins  auxiliary

 engine provides power for an additional generator, with a  second Mercedes generator 
providing emergency capacity  via an emergency switchboard . All engines were being 
run on marine diesel oil.  
2.31 Ventilation for the engine room is provided by two sets of electric -driven fans (Fan 1 
and Fan 2) located on the port leg of the trawl gantry  (see figure 3) . Both fans supplied  
air into the port side  of the engine room . Excess air was expelled from the starboard 
side via a natural vent located on the starboard trawl gantry leg and an extraction fan 
on the trawl deck that worked in tandem with supply Fan 2. Each vent was fitted with a 
sliding type quick -closing fire damper  and fan with a butterfly type damper within the 
fan trunking (see figure s 4 and 5 ).

2.38 When the main engine is running, low -pressure fuel circulates through the fuel filter 
arrangement to the injector  pumps  on the main engine. The injector pumps deliver the 
fuel at hig h pressure to their respective engine cylinder. Any fuel not picked up and 
delivered by the injector pumps returns to the fuel service tank and then back through 
the filters in a continuous loop.  

 
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  2.39 Two accumulators are fitted to the fuel filter arrangement:  one to the line supplying 
fuel to the main engine and one to the return fuel line. Their purpose is to absorb any 
fuel pressure shock loading (pulsing) created by the action of the injector pumps.  
2.40 As mentioned, after the crew had extinguished the fire the y found the accumulator 
that was normally fixed on the supply line was missing. They found it lying on the tank 
top directly below where it should have been fixed  (refer to figure 8). 
2.41 The other accumulator on the return line was still in place. It was found to be 
supported by a bracket designed to protect it against vibration, which would have also 
prevented it from unwinding from its fitting. There was no evidence of a similar 
support bracket having been fitted to the supply line accumulator at the time it 
became detached.  
2.42 Service records show that the detached accumulator was supplied and fitted on 25 
May 2021 when the vessel was in Dunedin before  departing on the accident voyage. 
The old accumulator had been sent ashore to a hydraulics contractor for servicing, but 
was found to be unserviceable. According to Talley’s they instructed the contractor to 
replace it with a new accumulator . The hydraulics contractor supplied a replacement 
accumulator  and a connector  for attaching to the fuel line . 
2.43 No information on the history of this replacement accumulator was available. It had 
been located in the hydraulic s contractor’s inventory several years earlier , but the 
contractor  had moved premises and introduced  a new inventory control system. The 
replacement accumulator was brought across from the old premises , but was not 
entered into the new inve ntory system. It had a manufactured date of 20 06 stamped 
into its steel casing .  
2.44 The hy draulics contractor  supplied a  new connector compatible with the accumulator 
and the fuel pipe on the vessel. The new connector was fitted to the replacement 
accumulator at the contractor ’s workshop  ashore. The contractor then fit ted this 
assembly to the f uel pipe in the engine room . 
2.45 After the fire , the replacement accumulator that had detached was retained by the 
crew. The Commission later took possession of it for examination and testing. The old 
replaced accumulator was also recovered from the hydraulics  contractor  in Dunedin. 
Both accumulators were sent to a metallurgist for examination.  
2.46 The fuel pipe that had been repaired shortly before the fire was also removed and 
retained by the Commission . This pipe was also sent to the metallurgist for 
examination . 
Tests and research  
The repaired fuel pipe 
2.47 The full metallurgist report is given in appendix 3. The report concluded (in part) the 
following:  
The examination of the piping revealed that it was highly likely that it had leaked as a 
result of the  initiation of a high cycle fatigue crack at the edge of the fillet weld 
between the piping and the square flange. This type of failure often occurs when 
unsupported piping can resonate at its natural frequency. This may have occurred at 
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 13 >>
 certain operationa l conditions at a specific excitation frequency. This type of failure is 
typically not directly related to the age of the piping.  
Accumulators  
2.48 The full metallurgist report is given in appendix 3. The report concluded (in part) the 
following:  
Accumulator  
The female threads were in good undamaged condition and they had an [internal 
diameter] of 16.47mm.  
There was no evidence of a thread locking agent having been applied.  
A minor witness mark was present on the end of the accumulator where the 
connector had be en located. However, there was no surface indentation/damage 
marks present as would be expected to be seen if the connector had been tightly 
fastened into the accumulator . 
Connector  
The male threads of the new connector, that had become unscrewed prior to the fire, 
were in an undamaged condition and had an [outside diameter ] of 17.75mm . 
There was no evidence of a thread locking agent being applied to the male 
connector threads . 
The ma le end of the connector was screwed into the female end of the new 
accumulator. They were a good fit, consistent with matching threads that were 
correctly machined. The connector could be very easily screwed in or out, i.e. with a 
very low torque.  
The inte gral hexagonal section of the new accumulator connector (24mm across 
flats) was free of any contact damage, see Figure 6. This indicates that it is unlikely 
that this connector had been tightened to a relatively high torque, even with a 
correctly sized spa nner.  
Conversely, minor damage marks were present on the large nut on the connector 
(27mm across flats), where a spanner had been located. These marks are consistent 
with a correctly sized spanner being applied with a relatively high torque.  
The connecting surface of the connector, that should have been in contact with the 
accumulator, consisted of a square section elastomeric seal located in a 
circumferential rectangular groove. Outside the groove was a contact ring that was 
about 1.5mm wide. The  elastomeric seal and the contact ring surface were 
undamaged.  
2.49 The metallurgist’s observations  are discussed in the analysis of this report . 
Bench testing of accumulator  and repaired fuel pipe  
2.50 The replacement accumulator , its new connector and the repaired  fuel pipe were taken 
to an independent hydraulics workshop  for further examination and testing. The 
purpose of  these tests was to : 
1. establish whether the repair to the fuel pipe was successful , and  
 
 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  2. establish  at what point during the accumulator unscrewing from its connector 
would the connection begin to visibly leak  marine diesel oil . 
 
2.51 The repaired fuel pipe was  installed on a testbed filled with  marine diesel oil and 
subjected to 10 bar pressure . The fuel pipe did not leak . 
2.52 The connector for the  accumulator was fixed to the testbed and the accumulator 
screwed down on to the connector  (see figure 9). The hydraulics expert noted that it 
was a ‘loose fit ’ between the male thread on the connector and the female thread in 
the ac cumulator. The loose fit allowed considerable lateral play between the two 
components until the steel -on-steel mating between the two was achieved . 
2.53 The connector thread was identified as M18 x 1.5  pitch13 with a flat  face O -ring. The 
hydraulics expert  considered the connector thread to have been machined at the lower 
(smaller) end of the allowable range , but within tolerance . 
  
 
13 M18 refers to the nominal diameter in millimeters  and 1.5 pitch means there is 1.5 millimeters  from thread to 
thread .

2.54 The accumulator was screwed onto the connector and made hand tight only . The 
connection was then subjected to 10 bar pressure . The connection did not leak . The

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  accumulator was then unscrewed a one-quarter turn. The marine diesel oil began 
flowing freely from the connection when  reaching about 2 bar pressure. The 
accumulator was then screwed down a 1/8th turn ( i.e., a1/8th turn unscrewed  from 
hand tight ). Marine diesel oil dripped from the connection  when the accumulator was 
rocked  side to side made possible by the tolerance between the two threads . 
Fire investigation  
2.55 The Commission engaged a fire investigator to assist in determining the cause of the 
fire. A copy of their full report is included as appendix 2. The fire investigator 
concluded  (in part):  
The point of origin  [of the fire] was identified and confirmed as w ithin the area of the 
[exhaust] manifold  end box . 
The accumulator has detached from its pipework and diesel oil spray  resulting from the 
open connection has sprayed onto surfaces  above , including the [exhaust] manifold cap . It 
is most likely  that some of this diesel oil has come into direct contact with the hot exhaust 
manifold , exhaust pipework  and/or clamps . A small inspection flap at the forward end of 
the engine was found unsecured and would have allowed diesel oil  to enter the area 
housi ng the exhaust manifold.  
The flame  had travelled all the way back to the o pen connection feeding the missing 
accumulator . 
The cause of the fire is believed to be the hot surface ignition of diesel oil  which was 
spraying from an open pipe where an accumulat or has detached from its normal 
mounting position . 
Other relevant information  
Fixed  engine room Halon gaseous  fire-extin guishing system  
2.56 The Amaltal Enterprise  was fitted with a fixed Halon  gaseous  fire-extinguishing system 
for supressing fire in  the engine room. The crew did n ot activate the system when 
fighting the fire . They said they did not think it was necessary because other measures 
they had taken  had quickly brought the fire under control. A description of the system 
is included  because there was some risk  that it  would not have deliver ed sufficient 
Halon into the engine room after the initial fire , had the crew needed to use it.  
2.57 The system comprise d four independent Halon -filled pressure cylinders , three located 
in the main engine room (the space they are designed to protect)  and one in the 
steering gear flat for protecting the emergency generator room . Upon activation  each 
bottle in the engine room releases Halon directly into the space  where they are 
located . 
2.58 The system was electrically activated from a  control panel  on the bridge . Opening  the 
door to the control  panel  initiates two automatic functions:  shutdown of any fans 
suppl ying or extract ing air to and from the engine room;  and a distinctive alarm 
sound ing in the engine room  to alert any crew to immediately vacate the space . 
2.59 Each Halon bottle has a discharge assembly fitted to the top of the bottle , 
incorporating a 24-volt direct c urrent ( DC) solenoid . The solenoids are wired in parallel 
back to the control panel . When the Halon system is activated, the solenoids are

 energised , resulting in the release of Halon from three  bottles  directly into the engine 
room or one bottle directly into the refrigeration plant room  (see figure 10). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10: Photograph of Halon bottle near seat of fire  
 
2.60 There is also a pressure sensor within each discharge assembly, which are all wired in 
series back to the control panel. A drop in pressure in any one of the bottles  will be 
detected and an alarm activated in the control panel on the bridge.  
2.61 Post-fire inspection revealed heat damage to the insulation shrouding the 24 -volt 
cables  leading to the release assembly on two of the Halon bottles. The m ost severe 
damage was to the cables  on the bottle locat ed in the immediate vicinity of the seat of

safety reasons and due to the extensive damage to electric cabling within the engine 
room.  
2.62 Maritime Rule Part 40D – Design Con struction and Equipment – Fishing Ships14 came 
into force on 1 February 2000.  The Amaltal Enterprise  was built in 1988 and was first 
registered as a New Zealand vessel  on 21  December 2000 . Rule Part 40D15 required 
that the Amaltal Enterprise ’s engine room be protected by  either a pressure water 
spraying system, or a gaseous fire -extinguishing system, or a high -expansion foam  
system. Whichever system is installed  it had to be compliant with the standards given 
in Maritime Rule Part 42B  – Safety Equipment – Fire Appliances Performance 
Standards . 
2.63 However , at the time the Amaltal Enterprise  was registered, Rule Part 42B was not yet 
in force . Part 42B was signed into law by the Transport Minister on 18 December 2000 , 
but did not enter into force  until 1 February 2001 , one year after Rule 40D came into 
force and five weeks after the registration of  the Amaltal Enterprise . Part 42B  replaced 
the s tandards made under the Shipping (Fire Appliances) Regulations 1989 .16 
Accordingly, the standards that applied  to the Amaltal Enterprise’s  fire appliances at 
the time of the vessel’s registration were as set out in the  in the Fire Appliances (Code 
of Pract ice for Ships of Class X) Notice 1989  (the Notice).17 
2.64 The Notice requir ed the vessel’s fixed fire -smothering gas installation to comply  with 
Clause 24 of the General Code .18 Clause 24 (3) of the General Code required  compliance 
with the performance standard s (referred to in Clause 2  of the General Code.  Clause 2 ) 
authorised the Minister to prescribe  the performance standards by notice in the 
Gazette ,19 which he did  by issuing The Shipping (Fixed Gas Fire Extinguishing Systems) 
Notice 1989.  This Notice  required the  storage pressure containers  to be located 
outside the protected space  (with some limited exceptions).20 
2.65 The Amaltal Enterprise  was fitted with a fixed gaseous Halon fire-extinguishing system . 
The Halon system was placed on the Amaltal Enterprise  during its  new build in 1988 in 
accordance with the standards of the relevant foreign maritime administration  at that 
time.   
2.66 Rule Part 42B came into force on 1 Febr uary 2001, replacing the  performance 
standards for fire appliances  set out in the many Gazette  Notices issued by the Minister 
under the legislation in force at that time.  Part 42B references the IMO Marine Safety 
Circular MSC Circular  848 (8 June 1998)21 (MSC  848), which provided guidelines for 
fixed gas eous  fire-extinguishing systems , such as the Halon system fitted to the 
Amaltal Enterprise . The MSC 848 allowed for the Halon bottles to be  located 
throughout the engine room , but under a number of conditions  (see appendix 1 for

 the full circular) . One condition was that in the event of damage to the release 
mechanism to one Halon bottle,  “at least five -sixths ” of the required amount of Halon 
gas could still be discharged into the engine room.  
2.67 The guidelines were amended in 2008 through MSC1/Circ.1267. That requirement was 
reworded to require that at least the amount of Halon needed to achieve the minimum 
extinguishing concentration could  still be discharged into the engine room.  
2.68 The amount of H alon required for a space was derived from a formula fundamentally 
based on the volume of the space  to be protected . The calculated volume of the 
Amaltal Enterprise ’s engine room was 792 cubic metres , which  meant 220 kilograms of 
liquid Halon was required to protect the space .22 The 220 kilograms  of Halon was 
stored in the three Halon bottles mentioned  (about 73 kilograms  per bottle) . No 
reserve  was provided in the event that one or more bottles failed to release due to  
damage by fire , explosion or other means .

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  3 Analysis  
Tātaritanga  
Introduction  
3.1 A high percentage of shipboard fires originate in engine rooms . These spaces  usually 
contain several fuel -fed internal combustion engines and ancillary  equipment , which 
makes the  engine room  an inherently high fire risk compartment . Good design and 
maintenance is key to managing the risk of engine room fires . If a fire occurs , the 
consequences are managed by mandatory portable and fixed fire protection system s. 
Also, c rew are required to be trained in fighting fires . Procedures that form part of 
safety management systems are developed for crew to follow in response to a fire.  
3.2 The crew response to this fire generally followed good industry practice  and resulted in 
it being quickly b rought under control. As always , however , there are les sons that can 
be drawn and applied to the industry to  help manage the risk of fire on board ships in 
future.  
3.3 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding this fire . Factors  have 
been identified  that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the 
severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues  that could  have an adverse  
effect on future ope rations.  
How the fire occurred  
3.4 The spread of diesel oil  and burn patterns  from the fire directly  above the fuel filter 
arrangemen t supports the hypothesis that the accumulator had  separated from its 
threaded connection , allowing diesel oil to coat the stru cture and pipework  above that 
point . 
3.5 There are many potential sources of ignition in an engine room, particularly around 
operating machinery.  Consequently , it could not be determined with certainty what 
provided the ignition source for the fire.  
3.6 That said, exhaust manifolds are a prime source of ignition due to their high 
temperature  (typical ly about 350 ºC for the Amaltal Enterprise’s  main engine) . The 
ignition temperature of diesel oil ranges betwe en 230 ºC and 256 ºC.23 Exhaust gases 
leave the eng ine via pipes from each cylinder  and then enter the  exhaust  manifold, 
which  runs along the top of the engine . The manifold was covered with  a heat shield  to 
provide protection against fire and prevent injury . The heat shield typically reaches 
temperatures between 70 ºC and 80ºC. 
3.7 There is a  small inspection flap on top of the  forward end of the main engine , 
immediately above the fuel filter arrangement. Its purpose is for protecting  a small gap 
between  the heat shield  around the exhaust manifold and the engine cylinder heads . 
This flap was located within the area coated by diesel oil spraying from where the 
accumulator had been located . The flap was not secured  and would have been  a point  
where  oil could enter  the exhaust manifold space.  Therefore , it is about as likely as not  
the main engine exhaust manifold was the source of ignition for the marine diesel oil.

 3.8 The fire almost certainly  began when marine diesel oil from the main engine low -
pressure fuel s ystem escaped under pressure when the accumulator dislodged from its 
fuel pipe. At a typical operating pressure of 8 bar, diesel oil has sprayed  upwards , 
spraying the deckhead above and then dropping down over the main engine and 
alternator below.  
The accu mulat or 
Condition  of the accumulator  
3.9 The accumulator that dislodged  from its fuel pipe was not new. Its steel  casing had 
been manufactured in 2006 , but little is known of its service history other than it was 
‘used’ inventory that had not been entered into the supplier’s recently  introduced 
inventory system.  
3.10 The accumulator works by charging the rubber bladder  with nitrogen gas to a pressure 
compatible with the pressure of the low-pressure fuel syste m. Any pressure in the fuel 
system will compress the bladder from the bottom until the pressure in the bladder is 
equal to the pressure in the fuel line . If the pressure in the fuel line fluctuates then the 
rubber bladder flexes in response, therefore  acting as a form of shock absorb er. 
3.11 When the accumulator was dismantled, it was found that the rubber bladder had split 
circumferentially  around the lip at the top where it sealed onto the end cap. It could 
not be determined exactly when the split had occurred. The accumulator had been  
installed in Dun edin at the beginning of the voyage about five weeks earlier. The 
hydraulics contractor who supplied and fit ted the accumulator said they had charged 
the bladder with nitrogen gas and checked that it was holding its charge before fitting 
it on board. The accumulator would not have held its charge if the bladder had been 
split at that time. It is therefore  very likely  that the bladder failed  while in service 
during the accident voyage . 
3.12 The bladder was manufactured in 2004,  meaning it was about 17 years old, two years 
older than the casing in which it was installed.  As mentioned, the service history of the 
bladder is unknown . It is possible that it had remained idle for a prolonged period. The 
manufacturer’s instruction is that lubrication mus t be applied between the bladder and 
the steel casing when replacing the bladder or if the accumulator had been idle for a 
prolonged time. The hydraulics contractor did not lubricate inside the accumulator 
before fitting  it on board the Amaltal Enterprise . 
3.13 There was nothing in the manufacturer’s maintenance and installation manual to 
indicate how often the bladders should be changed. The hydraulics contractor opined 
that for this type of installation they were replaced when they failed. The fact that the 
bladder was stamped with a manufactured date would indicate that the age of a 
bladder had significance . The manufacturer advised that there  is no exact 
recommended interval for replacing the bladder of an accumulator because its life 
depends on too many fact ors beyond their control, such as (but not limited to ): 
• compatibility of the working fluid with the bladder material  
• correct pressure and temperature ranges  
• correct pre -charge pressure of the accumulator  
• presence of contaminants in the fluid  
 
 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  • pressure and/or temperature fluctuations  
• regular maintenance intervals . 
3.14 With the internal bladder having failed  the accumulator would not have been 
performing as designed. Marine diesel oil would have invaded the entire cavity , 
including inside  the bladder . The accumulator would then have been subjected to any 
pulsing in the fuel system, a phenomenon it was installed  to absorb . 
3.15 The condition of the thread on both the accumulator and the male fitting of its 
connector was observed to be good. There was no observable damage to the threads 
on either , meaning it was virtually certain that the accumulator had unscrewed  from its 
connector , rather than  it having been forced of f under pressure . 
Dislod ging of the accumulator  
3.16 From the crew ’s account of events the work on the repaired fuel pipe was completed , 
the area cleaned , the fuel system pressurised  and checked for leaks , and then the main 
engine was restarted. Within about 50  minutes, the accumulator had unscrewed  
completely and fallen  to the tank top below , escaping fuel had ignited , and th ese 
conditions had caused a main engine alarm to activate.  
3.17 The accumulator that dislodged was located in the immediate area where the crew had 
been working . Their focus and attention would have been on the fuel pipe that had 
just been repaired and refitted . They would have had little idea that the accumulator 
located immediately above and to the left of this repaired fuel pipe was about to 
become an issue.  Nevertheless , a major leak should  have been obvious  to them , a 
minor leak perhaps less so . It is therefore about as likely as not  that the accumulator 
was not leaking when they left the engine room. The re asons for this are discussed in 
the following  sections . 
3.18 The accumulator had been fitted to the fuel system more than five weeks prior to it 
becoming dislodged. The crew said that they had carried out no work on the 
accumulator sin ce it was fitted . The following analysis is made on that premise . 
3.19 The Commissi on considered  several possible  factors that singularly or in combination 
caused the accumulator to unwind and dislodge . 
1. A lower -than-normal torque was applied when fitting the  connector into the 
accumulator at the hydraulic s contractor’s workshop before the assembly was 
fitted on board . 
2. Forced v ibration  and resonance created by the machinery and propulsion 
system in the engine room  have caused the accumulator to  lose the steel -on-
steel surface contact with its connector . 
3. The observed ‘ loose fit’ between the male thread on the connector and the 
female thread of the accumulator once the steel-on-steel connection between 
the two compone nts was lost allowed  lateral play between the two , making  the 
assembly  more susc eptible to vibration and affording  little resistance to prevent 
the accumulator from unscrewing . 
4. Failure of the bladder within the accumulator meant the assembly was 
susceptible  to pressure pulsing within the fuel system rather than absorbing 
these forces  as it was installed  to do . 
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 23 >>
 5. The accumulator was not fitted with a supporting bracket  or any other  means of 
preventing it from unwinding . 
Fitting the accumulator  
3.20 The hydraulics contractor who fitted the connector into the accumulator was confident 
that normal torque had been applied to tighten the connector to the accumulator. The 
contractor described placing the square end of the accumulator in a vice and using an 
open spanner to tighten it. A  torque wrench was not used because these are not 
readily available for open -end spanner applications . The contractor was an experienced 
hydraulics engineer and used that experience to judge the torque needed to obtain a 
good tight connection.  
3.21 For the type  of connector used the seal is not provided by the steel -on-steel face , but 
instead by the encapsulated elastomeric24 O-ring. The liquid in the pipe forces the O -
ring on to the steel face of the accumulator. The higher the pressure in the pipe, the 
more effective  the seal. The steel -on-steel face between the connector and the 
accumulator need only be tight enough to prevent the O -ring bursting out of its cavity  
and to prevent the accumulator from unscrewing  (refer to figure 8). 
3.22 The metallurgist engaged by the Commission opined that it was highly likely that the 
connector  had not been fully tightened into the accumulator before the assembly was 
fitted on board. This hypothesis was based on two observations: first, the lack of 
damage to the smaller (24 millimetre ) integral  hexagonal section of the con nector ; and 
second , the absence of damage  to the O-ring and the metal ring on the connector that 
would normally be in contact with the accumulator.  
3.23 The metallurgist noted the slight damage  evident on the larger (27 millimetre ) nut of 
the new connector  (the end that connected the assembly to the fuel pipe ) and 
correlated this to the lack of similar damage on the small nut . They therefore 
concluded that the small n ut had not been fully tightened into the accumulator . The 
metallurgist also noted the significant damage  to the nut on the old connector that 
was fitted to  the old, discarded  accumulator  and similarly correlated this with the lack 
of similar damage on the new connector , with the same conclusion that the new 
connector had not been fully tightened (see appendix 3).  
3.24 However, the amount of damage inflicted on a hexagonal nut will depend on several 
factors : 
• how often it has been tightened or loosened  
• what type , quality  and compatibility of the  spanner used each time  
• how much force has been applied  on each occasion  to tighten it , as well as  how 
much is required to loosen it  
• at what angle to the hexagonal plane  the spanner was used on each occasion . 
3.25 As mentioned, achieving a  seal between the newly supplied accumulator and its new  
connector did not rely on a particularly high torque . However, t he connector  on the 
old, discarded  accumulator  was different . It had a  different style of seal ; one that relied 
on a tight mating between the connector and the accumulator  through a  metal 
washer . There was no elastomeric O-ring. This connector would have required a higher 
torque to achieve a seal than the new connector that was supplied with the new 
 
24 Compound that has rubber -like properties . 
 
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  accumulator. Also, it was old and little is known of its history . Therefore, comparing  the 
condition of these two hexagonal nuts provide s little useful basis for the hypothesis 
that the new connector was not fully tightened into t he accumulator.  
3.26 Similarly, comparing the condition of the small and large hexagonal nuts on the new 
connector provides little support  to the hypothesis. The smaller end of the connector  
that inserted into the accumulator had a different type of seal than the large nut that 
fitted to the fuel pipe on board . The smaller end of the connector  was fitted to the 
accumulator in the workshop  with the accumulator clamped in a vice . The  
accumulato r/connector assembly was then fitted to the fuel pipe on board with a 
larger  spanner . The absence of damage on the small end of the connector could 
simply be explained by the circumstances of the two fitments being different . 
3.27 In summary, it has not been possible to establish how tightly the connector was fitted  
to the accumulator in the Dunedin workshop . This is particularly so when considering  
the other potential factors discussed in the following sections , and the fact that the 
connection is said to have maintained its integrity for about five operational weeks at 
sea before the accumulator dislodged.  
Vibration and resonance  
3.28 Left in free vibration25 a system or component will always vibrate at its natural 
frequency. Forced vibration  is a type of vibration in which a force is repeatedly applied 
to a mechanical system or component .26 If the forced vibration  is different from  the 
natural frequency of the component , then t he amplitude of s uch vibrations is usually 
small. Resonant vibrati on is forced vibration in which the frequency of the disturbing 
force is very close to the natural frequency of the system  or the component .27 When 
resonant vibration occurs t he amplitude of vibration  is very large  and potentially more 
destructive . 
3.29 Forced  and resonan t vibrations in an engine room can be problematic . There are many 
potential sources of vibration from operating  systems : combustion engines, pumps, 
compressors, gearboxes  and propellers , to name a few.  Some potential effects of 
vibration are  the loosening of components, chafe  or wearing,  cracking and (in extreme 
cases ) destruction if resonant vibration is present  and allowed to prevail . Components, 
particularly safety -critical components , are usually clamped or supported to dampe n or 
guard against  the effects of vibration . Clamping of the accumulator is discussed in the 
following sections . 
3.30 Because the Amaltal Enterprise  was in port undergoing an extensive refit following the 
fire, it has not been possible to replicate the state of  vibration around the fuel filter 
arrangement where the accumulators were located . Of note , however , was that one 
end of the fuel pipe to which it was fitted was clamped  to the solid ship structure  and 
the other directly to the main engine. The main engine was mounted on resilient 
chocks , which were designed to allow the engine to flex independent ly of the ship ’s 
structure. This arrangement was a potential source of vibration and stress on the pipe  
and the accumulator assembly.  It would have been  good engineering practice to

 incorporate a flexible section of fuel hose between the engine and the fuel filter 
arrangement to alleviate this potential source of stress on the  system’s  components.  
3.31 It is virtually  certain  that the fuel filter arrangement was to some degree subject ed to 
vibration during normal operation , and that any vibration could potentially have 
contributed to disestablishing the steel-on-steel contact between the accumulator and 
its connec tor, and /or accelerated  the process of it unscrewing  and dislodging . 
However, w e cannot say  how much of a factor it was. It would depend on the other 
circumstances discussed in this section.  
Loose  fit between  threads  
3.32 As mentioned , there was a loose fit between the male thread of the connector and the 
female thread on the accumulator. The differe nce in the two threads is considered 
within acceptable tolerances  and is the result of matching components from different 
manufacture rs who machine their components to slightly different tolerances. The 
result was  notic eable lateral play between the two co mponents . However, the lateral 
play was prevented  when the connector was tightened into the accumulator and the 
steel-on-steel mating between the two components  was achieved . 
3.33 The threads on both components being  undamaged  is a further indicator that both 
had been manufactured within acceptable tole rances. However, the lateral play meant 
that when the steel-on-steel mating was lost as the accumulator began unscrewing  
from its connector , the accumulator would have been more prone to any vibration  and 
there was very little resistance to it unscrewing . For this reason , it is likely  to have been 
a factor contributing  to the accumulator dislodging.  
Failure of the bladder  
3.34 As mentioned, it is very likely  the bladder failed during t he accident voyage . Before it 
failed it would have occupied most of the internal cavity  of the steel housing, charged 
with nitrogen gas at about 4 bar pressure , and would have been absorbing the 
fluctuations in fuel pressure (pulsing)  caused by the action of the fuel injector pumps . 
Once it failed  diesel oil would have invaded the entire cavity, displacing the nitrogen 
gas. From that  point the accumulator and its  connector would have been subjected to 
the pulsing in the fuel system  rather than protecting against it.  It is possible that 
pulsing in the fuel system assisted in the accumulator unscrewing , particularly when 
the steel -on-steel face between the accumulat or and its connector was lost and it then 
became  more prone to vibration as well.  
3.35 The bladder developed circumferentia l tears around the top lip close to where  it sealed 
around the top cap. According to its date stamp it was about  17 years old . Given the 
lack of service history prior to it having been fitted, it would have been good 
engineering practice to have replaced it with a new one before putting the 
accumulator back in service , or at least removed, inspected and lubricated it in 
accordance with the m anufacturer’s recommendations.  
Support bracket  
3.36 There were several other accumulators fitted around  the Amaltal Enterprise ’s 
machinery spaces. Most were supported by a bracket to guard against vibration. The 
two accumulators fitted to the fuel filter arrangement weighed about 5 kilograms , 
which if left unsupported and subjected to vibration would cause adverse stresses on 
the vertical fuel pipes to which they were fitted, including their connectors.  
 
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  3.37 The other accumulator fitted to the fuel filter arrangement was fitted with  a supporting 
bracket, which served a secondary purpose of preventing the accumulator from 
rotating ( unscrewing  from its connector). As mentioned, the accumulator that 
dislodged was not fitted with a supporting bracket  at the time of the accident . Talley’s 
confirmed  that such a bracket had been fitted in 2015 , but they had  no record of when 
it had been remove d. The old , discarded accumulator bore the marks on its steel 
casing  consistent with a support bracket  having been fitted at some time .  
3.38 It would have been  good engineering practice to have fitted a support bracket to the 
accumulator . It is virtually certa in that h ad one been fitted  the accumulator would 
have been prevented from unscrewing  and the fire would not have occurred. A 
support bracket would have been the last defence in the system – a safeguard against 
the other potential contributing factors discussed above . 
Engine room exhaust fan  
3.39 The No. 2 exhaust fan for the engine room had shut down when the Amaltal Enterprise  
blacked out, but it operated again when the emergency generator auto -started in 
response to the black  out. The  running fan hampered the crew’s efforts to shut down 
the engine room and starve the fire of air. We discuss why this occurred because its 
failure to shut down could potentially have worsened the consequences of the fire.  
3.40 The emergency  power supply to  the No. 2 exhaust fan was from  the emergency 
generator switchboard located in the emergency generator room. This was a design 
feature that would provide a means of mechanically ventilating the engine room if 
power from the main switchboard was not available. The circuit breaker28 that 
protected the power supply to the No. 2 exhaust fan could also be remotely tripped by 
activating an electromagnetic coil29 called a ‘shunt trip’ accessory fitted to the circuit 
breaker. Normally , this shunt trip would mechanically  trip the circuit breaker when it 
was energised by the remote switches on the bridge.  
3.41 On the Amaltal Enterprise , power to the shunt trip could be applied from the bridge by 
either pushing the emergency stop buttons or opening the Halon cabinet door  (as 
described in  paragraph  2.58). Either action should have activated the shunt trip coil 
and tripped the exhaust fan circuit breaker, stopping the fan. The crew tried both 
methods , but the fan continued to run.  
3.42 During the refit of damaged electrical systems in Nelson it was found that the shunt 
trip coil windings in the No. 2 ventilator fan circuit breaker  had burnt out, rendering it 
unserviceable. This was the reason why neither action taken by the crew stopped the 
fan. The fan stopped only when the chief engineer went to the emergency generator 
switchboard and manually tripped the circuit breaker.  
3.43 Testing  of remote trips is undertaken periodically as part of planned 
maintenance/checks conducted by crew, and these devices are also tested periodically 
in the presence of surveyors. It could not be established when the coil winding in the 
shunt trip had burnt out. The design of the electrical systems on board  the Amaltal 
Enterprise  was such that when the remote trip switches are closed (pushing the remote 
stops or opening the door on the Halon cabinet) , the shunt trip coil is energised for a 
short period of tim e to activate  the mechanical trip mechanism . If the coil remains

  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 27 >>
 energised due to a me chanical fault with the coil or the trip mechanism, it can 
potentially cause the shunt trip coil to overheat and burn out.  This would not 
necessarily become apparent unti l the remote trip  function was  tested  or activated in 
an emergency , as in this case. The shunt trip was replaced during the post -fire refit . 
Maintenance  
Safety issue: The process for  supervisi ng and contro lling maintenance conducted by shore 
contractors during the port turnaround  in Dunedin did not adequately manage the risk  of what 
could happen if systems are left in an unsafe state.   
3.44 The system for programming maintenance on board Talley ’s vessels during port 
turnarounds was robust enough and in general the Amaltal Enterprise  had the 
appearance of a well -maintained vessel.  
3.45 The Amaltal Enterprise  spen t long periods (about six weeks) at sea fishing . 
Maintenance  that cannot be performed at sea is progr ammed for the relatively short 
turnarounds while the vessel is in port discharging its product and replenishing for the 
next voyage. A variety of contractors are used to complete the agreed work . Most  of 
the crew usually change during this busy period , adding to the complexity of the port 
stay. 
3.46 The turnaround  in Dunedin before  the accident trip was typical of this process . Leaving 
aside the question of whether the new accumulator was properly installed , the process 
that was followed lacked rigo ur. The engin eering  staff who were leaving the vessel 
briefed the hydraulic s contractor on the task , and they were  then essentially left 
unsupervised to  remove it, the ship’s staff having depressurised the fuel system.  There 
was a delay in completing the task because the old accumulator was  deemed 
unserviceable and a replacement was sourced from the contractor’s stock. However, a 
connector that was compat ible with both the replacement accumulator and fuel pipe 
to which it would be fitted had to be sourced from Auckland.  
3.47 By the time the replacement accumulator and the new connector were ready for fitting 
on board , the engineer ing staff who had just joined  the vessel had taken  on the 
responsibility  for the task. The contra ctor fitted the accumulator, advised the engineers 
that they had done so and departed the vessel.  The fuel system was not then tested 
until the main engine was being readied for sea. The process did not include the 
following checks:  
• a check to ensure the f uel system was depressurised before work began  
• a check and sign -off that the task had been satisfactorily completed  
• a check that t he system was intact and operating correctly.  
3.48 The Commission has made a recommendation to address this safety issue  (see section 
6). 
Response to the fire  
3.49 As mentioned , the crew ’s response to the fire generally followed good industry 
practice. However, there  are a number of lessons that can be drawn from the response.  
 
 

<< Page 28 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  3.50 A good response to a fire is one where : everyone is alerted to the fact ; everyone is 
accounted for ; crew assemble in their assigned fire parties at their designated stations;  
and good communication is established between all fire parties.  
3.51 The chief engineer was knowledgeable about  what needed d oing to close down the 
engine room and immediately began working through the tasks. However, he was 
doing so without having reported to  an emergency assembly point  and had no means 
of communicating directly with the other parties.  The de signated assembly p oint for 
engineering staff  was the engine control room , which due to the location of the fire 
was not an option. The risk of not reporting to an alternative assembly point was that if 
something untoward happened to the ch ief engineer  (or others had adopted a similar 
approach ), and the fire then rapidly  became uncontrollable , then  the required 
command and control structure to fight the fire would be incomplete.  
3.52 Fortuitously , other crew members assembled at their stations and made preparations  
to fight the fire , and the actions of the chief engineer were successful in preventing it 
escalating out of control. The engineering staff later reported to an alternative 
assembly point and reported their headcount to the bridge.  However, there was some 
delay in completing the headcount and it  was not complete . With a crew of 45 it would 
be easy for someone to be in danger and missed . As it was , the first mate was sleeping 
and had not been aroused by the fire al arm. The first mate’s  absence went unnoticed 
until th e skipper wanted to communicate  and realised they had not been seen . 
Halon system  
Safety issue : The Halo n bottles for the fixed Halon gaseous  fire-extinguishing system were 
located in the machinery spaces , the spaces they were designed to protect. If one o r more 
bottles were disabled  because of the fire, the calculated  amount of  Halon gas to extinguish a 
major fire would not be available.  
3.53 The fixed Halon gas eous  fire-extinguishing system on board the Amaltal Enterprise  was 
not used to fight the fire . The crew decided not to activate it because they felt they had 
the fire under control . This appeared to have been a reasonable decision based on the 
outcome. They did have  the fire under control at the time and eventually succeeded in 
putting it out.  
3.54 This decision , however , brought with it a degree of  risk. Shipboard f ires can escalate 
from being under control to uncontrolled  in a very short time . Fixed gas eous fire-
smothering systems , where the gas is stored outside of the engine room , can of course 
be used at any stage of the firefighting response. However , for systems like that on the 
Amaltal Enterprise , where the gas is stored in the space that is on fire, the risk of the 
system  being rendered  partially or fully unserviceable  increases with time.  We were 
unable to determine how serviceable the Halon system would have been if the crew 
had later needed to use it. If just one of the three Halon bottles could not be re leased, 
it is unlikely there would have been sufficient Halon to achieve the ideal fire -
smothering required for a more serious fire.  
3.55 The vessel  had to comply with Rule Part 40D , which  required the fitting of a fixed 
engine room fire-smothering system that met the performance standards  prescribed in 
Rule Part 42B . Yet, Rule Part 42B did not come into force  until one year after Rul e Part 
40D came into force , during which period the Amaltal Enterprise  became  registered as 
a New Zealand ship . As Rule 42B w as not applicable because  it had  not entered into 
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 29 >>
 force, then the performance standards set out in  Gazette  Notices issued under the 
Shipping (Fire Appliances) Regula tions 1989  applied . Regardless , the Halon system was 
not compliant with either  performance standard  as both  specifically prohibit having 
the Halon bottles located in the engine room  – to manage t he risk of the system being 
compromised by any fire it was installed to combat.  
3.56 There were ma ny vessels world wide  that used Halon systems  where  the bottles were 
located in the engine room . In 1998 , the IMO recognised the risk and issued guidance 
in the form of a Marine Safety Circular  (MSC 848) . The  circular  impose d several 
conditions to mitigate the risk. One condition  was that sufficient  Halon must be carried  
so that if the release mechanism for one Halon bottle  is damaged , then at ‘least five -
sixths’ of the required amount of Halon gas could still be discharged in to the engine 
room . In 2008 , the IMO amended that condition  to require  that the  minimum 
extinguishing concentration in the space can still be discharged into the engine room  
if one Halon bottle is damaged . MSC848  is incorporated into the Maritime Rules  by 
way of reference in Part 42B.22(2).  
3.57 It is unclear why the Halon system , despite being non -compliant,  was approved  by the 
Lloyds Classification Society (Lloyds) who were the ‘recognised organisation ’ acting on 
behalf of Maritime New Zealand  (MNZ) . 
3.58 Talley ’s were unaware that the Halon system was not compliant, having relied on the 
process of  MNZ  and Classification Society certification.  Talley’s have now elected to 
replace the Halon system with a modern equivalent that compl ies with current 
maritime rules.  However, due to supply logistics the new system was not available for 
fitment during the refit following the fire. Their intention is to install the new system 
after July 2022 when all the components have been received . 
3.59 The Commission has made recommendations for  ensuring that this  is undertaken and  
managing the risk in the interim (see section 6 of this report) .

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  4 Findings  
Ngā kitenge  
 
4.1 It was virtually certain  that the source of fuel for  the fire was marine diesel oil that 
escaped under pressure when an accumulator in the low -pressure fuel system 
unwound from its pipe connector and dislodged.  
4.2 It is about as likely as not  that heat from the main engine exhaust provided the ignition 
for the  marine diesel oil.  
4.3 The thread s on the accumulator and its connector  were undamaged, meaning that the 
accumulator unscrewed  from its pipe connector  rather than having been forced off 
under pressure . 
4.4 It could not be established with any certainty what caused the accumulator to unscrew  
from its connector , but it is likely  to have been any  combination of the following 
conditions . 
• A lower -than-optimal  torque being  applied when fitting the connector into t he 
accumulator . 
• Vibration created by the machinery and propulsion system s in the engine room . 
• The ‘loose fit’ between the male thread on the connector and the female thread 
of the accumulator . Once the steel -on-steel connection between the two 
components was lost , lateral play between the two  made  the assembly more 
prone  to vibration and afford ed little resistance to the accumulator unscrewing . 
• The failure of the bladder within the accumulator meant the assembly was 
susceptible to pressure pulsi ng within the fuel system rather than achieving its 
purpose of absorbing these forces . 
4.5 The accumulator was unlikely  to have been fit -for-purpose when it was fitted on 
board the Amaltal Enterprise . This was because of the age of its internal  bladd er and 
no lubrication ha ving been applied between the bladder and the steel casing following 
an undetermined period in storage.  
4.6 The accumulator was free to unscrew  because it was not fitted with a supporting 
bracket or any other means of preventing it from u nwinding.  
4.7 The engine room No. 2 exhaust fan , which initially stopped operating when the ship 
blacked out, automatically started running  again when the emergency generator auto -
started . This h ampe red the crew ’s efforts to close down the engine room and depr ive 
the fire of oxygen , and potentially increased the consequences of the fire.  
4.8 The engine room No. 2 exhaust fan failed to shut down when the crew activated the 
remote trips because the shunt trip coil winding on the electrical  circuit breaker for the 
fan was burnt out . It could not be established when this fault had  occurred.  
4.9 The firefighting  response generally followed good industry practice and resulted in the 
fire being extinguished. However, there  are lessons to be drawn to  improve the 
standard  of future emergency response . 
4.10 The crew’s decision to not activate the engine room fixed Halon gas eous  fire-
smothering system was reasonable under the circumstances . However, under different 
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 31 >>
 circumstances any delay in activating the Ha lon system risked it not being fully 
functional due to it being in  the space it was designed to protect.  
4.11 The Halon system did not comply with the relevant New Zealand maritime legislation 
or IMO guidelines  because it had insufficient redundancy if the  fire had disabled part 
of the system .

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  5 Safety issues and remedial action  
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika  
General  
5.1 Safety issues are an output from the Commission’s analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely af fect future operations on a wide 
scale.   
5.2 Safety i ssues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.   
Maintenance control  
5.3 The process for supervising and controlling mai ntenance conducted by shore 
contractors during the port turnaround in Dunedin did not adequately manage the risk 
of what could happen if systems are left in an unsafe state.  
5.4 No action has been taken to address this safety issue. Therefore, the Commission h as 
made a recommendation in section  6 to address this issue.  
Uncompliant fixed Halon gas eous  fire-extinguishing system  
5.5 The crew’s decision to not activate the engine room fixed Halon gaseous fire -
smothering system was reasonable under the circumstances. However, under different 
circumstances any delay in activating the Halon system risked it not being fully 
functional due to it being in the space it was designed to protect.  
5.6 The Halon system did not comply with the relevant New Zealand marit ime legislation 
or IMO guidelines because it had insufficient redundancy if the fire had disabled part 
of the system.  
Other safety action  
5.7 Participants may take safety actions to address issues that would not normally result in 
the Commission issuing a reco mmendation.  
5.8 On 7 July 2021 , Talley’s issued a fleet mem orandum outlining the incident and advising 
crews to undertake a number of checks associated with the low -pressure fuel systems , 
including ensuring accumulators are well secured.  
5.9 Talley’s now require that all accumulators fitted to  its vessels be support ed by a 
bracket . 
5.10 MNZ ’s Rule Part 40 Series project team are conducting an in -depth evaluati on of  the 
regulatory settings for fire -fighting systems . This work includes consideration of 
appropriate performance and installation standards, how to regulate older systems, 
and which ships should be required to have on  board fire -fighting systems. ”We 
believe that this work will help ensure that the rules are clear and fit -for-purpose, 
reduc ing the risk of similar issues arising in the future .”  
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202

 5.11 It is unclear whether this misapplication of the relevant legislation to the Amaltal 
Enterprise  is an isolated case. However, the size of the New Zealand fishing fleet that 
could potentially be affect ed is small. The Commission welcomes this initiative  by MNZ.

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  6 Recommendations  
Ngā tūtohutanga  
General   
6.1 The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisati ons or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents.  
6.2 In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommen dation s are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent similar accidents or incidents  occurring in 
the future.    
New recommendations   
6.3 The Halon gas eous  fire-extinguishing system on  board the Amaltal Enterprise  did not 
meet the IMO guidance for systems where the extinguishing gas is located in the 
space it is designated to protect. After the accident, the owner of the vessel  has 
communicated that they intend  to replace the Halon system with a modern equivalent 
that complies with current maritime rules. However, due to supply logistics the new 
system was not available for fitment during the refit following the fire. The 
replacement fire -smothering system is scheduled to be progressively fitted during the 
vessel’s port turnarounds after July 2022 when all of the components have been 
received . 
6.4 On 25 May 2022 , the Commission recommended that Maritime New Zealand 
ensure that as soon as reasonably practicable the owner of the Amaltal Enterprise  
install a new system that complies with current maritime rules and put in place 
additional measures to manage the risk created by the limitations of the current 
fire-extinguishing system until such time as the  new system is installed . (009/22) 
On 13 July 2022 , MNZ replied:  
Maritime NZ have provided the Commission with the following response to 
recommendation 009/22:  
Maritime NZ accepts recommendation 009/22. W e understand that Talley’s plans to 
replace the fire -fighting system in the very near future. We will consider whether any 
compliance action is necessary until the system is replaced. Once the system is 
replaced, we will encourage the operator to review th eir Maritime Transport Operator 
Plan and make any necessary amendments based on lessons learned from the incident.  
 
In the longer term, Maritime NZ will continue to review the regulatory settings for fire -
fighting systems as part of the 40 Series project. This work includes consideration of 
appropriate performance and installation standards, how to regulate older systems, and 
which ships should be required to have on -board fire -fighting systems. We believe that 
this work will help ensure that the rules are clear and fit -for-purpose, reducing the risk 
of similar issues arising in the future. We are also considering whether there are any 
lessons from TAIC Report MO -2021 -202 in relation to our oversight of surveyors as 
third party regulators.  
 
 
  Final Report  MO-2021 -202 
<< Page 35 >>
  
6.5 On 25 May 2022 , the Commission recommended that  Talley’s introduces a 
system for managing contractors working on board. The system should include 
sign-off for each task , a job safety analysis for each task  that may pose  risks to 
the contractors or crew  and, where applica ble, testing to ensure the repaired 
system is fit -for-purpose.  (010/22)  
On 10 June 2022 , Talley’s replied:  
Talley’s have provided the Commission with the following response to recommendation 
010/22:  
 
a) Talley’s have prepared a draft PCBU overlapping duties framework to manage contractors 
at layups and turnarounds, using the WorkSafe Good Practise Guideline PCB U’s working 
together document. In addition to this, Talley’s is engaging in detailed consultations with 
shore staff, vessel staff, contractors, and other stakeholders, outcomes of which will help 
us to understand where additional processes may be required to support their current 
processes.  
b) On completion of the consultation process, guidance to support each step will be created 
and distributed to Talley’s staff, contractors and stakeholders, against which current 
activities can be benchmarked and modified if required.  
c) It is anticipated that the draft framework document will be finalised by the end of June 
2022 and the detailed processes by the end of July 2022.  
d) Additionally, as part of their ongoing initiatives to reduce risk, each step in the 
turnaround/ layup process has been reviewed, and updated documentation (worklists with 
contractor controls) and processes has been developed to manage all ongoing activities 
involving contractors on the vessels. Examples of this are:  
a. all contractors reporting to chie f/2ND engineer when they come aboard and 
depart the vessel  
b. review of qualifications and competencies of staff who issue permits.  
e) Finally, Talley’s are updating and continually modernising their PPM and maintenance 
systems. This includes the consideration of the implementation of a dedicated marine 
engineering software package (Marasoft) to assist in the managing of contractors 
working on board.

 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  7 Key lessons  
Ngā akoranga matua  
 
7.1 It is important that repair and maintenance is performed under controlled conditions, 
and with appropriate procedures for tagging out, checking , testing and signing off 
each task, particularly when working on safety -critical systems . 
7.2 Forced and resonant vibration in engine room s can be problematic . It is important that 
components are secured against vibration  to guard against the loosening, chafe  or 
wearing, cracking and (in extreme cases ) destruction of components, particularly 
safety -critical components.  
7.3 It is important that power supply  tripping devices that are designed for emergency 
situations are routinely tested to ensure they will function correctly during an 
emergency.  
7.4 When responding to an emergency it is crucial  that crew fully consider  the important 
elements of command and contr ol, specifically , accounting for all personnel and 
establishing good communications.  
7.5 When  a vessel has a  fixed gaseous fire-extinguishing system , where the gas and 
associated release mechanisms are  located in the space that they are designed to 
protect , it is important that crew understand that the longer they  delay activation , the 
higher the risk that fire will render these systems  partially or fully  inoperable .

9.1 On 3 July 2021, MNZ  notified the Commission of the occurrence. The Commission 
subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an Investigator -in-Charge  
9.2 The Amaltal Enterprise  arrived at Nelson  on th e evening of 5 July 2021 . On 5 July , the 
Commission issued a protection order  over affected areas in the Amaltal Enterprise  
engine room , including the main engine low -pressure fuel system arrangement.  
9.3 Two Commission investigators attended the vessel on 6 July 2021 and over four days 
conducted an examination of the site and interviewed key personnel from the crew 
and Talley’s shore management.  The Commission seized the accumulator and its 
connector , as w ell as a section of low -pressure fuel pipe that had been repaired shortly 
before the fire occurred.  
9.4 On 6 July 2021 , the Commission engaged a  specialist  fire investigator to determine the 
origin and cause of the fire.  
9.5 On 19 July 2021 , the Commission issued a seizure notice for, and took delivery of, the 
old accumulator that had been replaced in Dunedin . 
9.6 On 28 July  2021,  a Commission investigator revisited the Amaltal Enterprise  at Nelson 
to gather further evidence, after which the prot ection order placed over the 
components of the main engine low -pressure fuel system was lifted.  
9.7 On 29 July 2021 , the Commission engaged an expert metallurgist to examine and 
report on the condition of the  replaced and replacement accumulators  and the 
repai red fuel pipe from the Amaltal Enterprise . 
9.8 On 24 September 2021 , the Commission engaged  a hydraulics expert to pressure/leak 
test the section of repaired low-pressure fuel pipe that had been removed from the 
Amaltal Enterprise . 
9.9 On 27 October 2021, the Commission engaged a hydraulics expert to conduct a series 
of tests on the replacement accumulator and its pipe connect or. 
9.10 On 16 November 20 21, two investigators travelled to Dunedin and interviewed 
personnel from the hydraulics contractor . 
9.11 On 21 March 202 2, the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to  nine 
interested persons for their comment.  Submissions were received from five interested 
persons. Any changes as a result of those submissions have been included in the final 
report.

11 Agent containers may be stored within a protected machinery space if the containers are distributed 
throughout the space and the provisions of SOLAS regulation II -2/5.3.3 are met. The arrangement of 
containers and electrical circuits and piping essentia l for the release of any system should be such that 
in the event of damage to any one power release line through fire or explosion in the protected space, 
i.e. a single fault concept, at least five -sixths of the fire -extinguishing charge as required by par agraph 
5 of this annex can still be discharged having regard to the requirement for uniform distribution of 
medium throughout the space. The arrangements in respect of systems for spaces requiring less than 6 
containers should be to the satisfaction of the  Administration.

 12. 12  A minimum agent hold time of 15 min should be provided.  
13. 13  The release of an extinguishing agent may produce significant over and under 
pressurization in the  
protected space. Measures to limit the induced pressures to acceptable li mits should be provided.  
14 For all ships, the fire -extinguishing system design manual should address recommended procedures 
for the control of products of agent decomposition. The performance of fire -extinguishing 
arrangements on passenger ships should n ot present health hazards from decomposed extinguishing 
agents, e.g., on passenger ships, the decomposition products should not be discharged in the vicinity of 
muster (assembly) stations.

Fire Investigation Report  
FV Amaltal Ent erprise  
04/02/22  
 
Description and Use 
The Amaltal Enterprise  is a 69m Factory Fishing Trawler built in 1988.  
Pre-incident Events  
At the time of the fire the ship was working off the West Coast nearing the end of its six-
week trip. They had shut down their operation earlier in the day to repair a leak in a diesel oil 
pipe located below the diesel filters. This was repaired, cleaned up and thoroughly inspected 
following start up to ensure the repair was leak free. No other leak was detected during this 
inspec tion. 
Discovery of Fire  
A fire was discovered in the engine room of the ship after an “engine room alarm” activated 
in the  engineer’s workshop. The Chief Engineer went to the engine room to investigate the 
alarm and upon entering saw what he described as a “geyser of fire” coming from the 
accumulator.  
Fire Response  
The ship’s crew instigated their firefighting plan and extinguished the fire before it was able 
to spread  within the ship. An origin and cause investigation commenced on 8 July 2021 in 
Nelson.  
Interviews  
Formal interviews were conducted by TAIC staff, and the Chief Engineer and one other 
Engineer were available to assist with information during the investigation. Statements from 
all these sources inform this report.

 A large Wartsila engine is positioned about the 
centre of the engine room. Fire damage was 
evident around one end of the engine with the 
lowest point of fire damage being in the vicinity of 
an accumulator connected to the diesel oil supply 
to th e engine. Diesel oil was found above the 
accumulator and had reached the ceiling of the 
engine room as well as covering the wall and 
walkway in front of the engine.  
Fire damage had burnt through insulation on 
wiring, rubber components of pipework and soot 
deposits were found on steel components.  
Statements from the Chief Engineer reported that 
following the fire the accumulator had been found 
in the sump below the diesel oil filters .

 
 

<< Page 48 >>
 Final Report  MO-2021 -202  There were normally two accumulators loca ted around the vicinity of the fuel filters. The 
accumulators are made from steel and use a diaphragm to dampen pressure fluctuations and 
therefore ensure a constant diesel oil pressure is provided to the engine. It normally runs at 
8bar (800kPa).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One accumulator at the front of the engine was in place and has a bracket to support its 
weight and prevent inadvertent movement caused by vibrations of the engine. The other 
accumulator was unsupported with no bracket holding it in place, instead relying on the steel 
pipework to support it. This accumulator is the one reported to be found in the sump. Post 
fire the engineers on board have capped the feed to the missing accumulator and it was in 
this capped condition during my investi gation.  
Spread of diesel oil and burn patterns from the fire directly above the accumulator support 
the theory that it had separated from its threaded connection allowing diesel oil to coat the 
structure and pipework/fittings above this point.

Exhaust gases leave the engine via pipes from each cylinder and then enter a manifold which 
is surrounded by protective covers to prevent injury due to the heat. The ship ’s Chief 
Engineer stated that these covers typically operate at around  70-80°C.  
Between the engine and the manifold, hot exhaust gases are piped through an area known as 
the manifold box which is capped at each end with a steel cap. The cap can relatively easily 
be opened and doing so gives direct access to exhaust manifold pipes, clamps etc. The Chief 
Engineer stated that these pipes typically operate at around 350°C.  
The cap at the end of the manifold box was inspected during the investigation and was found 
to have some rust forming to one side of the cap, however the rest of the cap retained a 
black coating.  
The manifold box end cap was well within the area that had been coated with diesel oil 
spraying from where the accumulator was located.  
Inspection of the accumulator which had detached from its pipeline did not indicate  why it 
had become detached.

 Fire damage was found below the flooring next to the engine and this was caused by the fire 
following the diesel oil flow under that flooring.  
Point of Origin  
The point of fire origin was identified and confirmed as within the area of the manifold end 
box. 
The accumulator has detached from its pipework and diesel oil spray from the resulting open 
connection has sprayed onto surfaces above, including the manifold cap. It is most likely that 
some of this diesel oil has come into direct contact with the hot exhaust manifold, exhaust 
pipework and/or clamps. A small inspection flap at the forward end of the engine was found 
unsecured and would have allowed diesel oil to enter the area housing the  exhaust manifold.  
The ignition temperature of diesel ranges between 233°C and 256°C (Babrauskas, 2003).  
Hot surface ignition of the diesel oil has most likely occurred, and the fire has then travelled 
back along the diesel oil covered engine componentry a nd/or diesel oil spraying from the 
accumulator ’s open connection.  
The engine room alarm has alerted the Chief Engineer and when he arrived in the engine 
room the flame had travelled all the way back to the open connection feeding the missing 
accumulator,  creating  the “geyser of flame” described by the Chief Engineer when he arrived 
in the engine room.  
The cause of this fire is believed to be the hot surface ignition of diesel oil which was 
spraying from an open pipe where an accumulator has detached from it s normal mounting 
position.  
Elimination of Other Possible Causes  
Power was on at the time of the fire; however, no evidence of an electrical cause was found. 
All damage to electrical wiring and equipment appears to be caused by radiant heat damage 
as a res ult of the fire.  
No evidence of a natural or deliberate ignition source was discovered.  
Based on the evidence available at the time, this fire has been recorded as accidental.

 of 11 Executive Summary 
The Transp ort Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is investigating an incident where a 
fire occu rred in the engine room of fishing vesse l Amatal Enterprise . It was reported that after 
the fire was extin guished, an accu mulator on the fuel supply line to the engine was found away 
from its normal location. It appeared as if the accumul ator had become unscrewed from its 
asso ciated fitting and that the fire occurred due to the resultant fuel leakage.  
 
The accu mulator and its piping connector had recently been fitted. It was reported that the old 
accu mulator was replaced as it could not be adequately charged with nitrogen and  a leak had 
occu rred at the screw on fitting.  
 
A few days prior to the fire, a fuel line pipe had leaked next to a welded-on fitting. This had 
then been repaired, initially by welding up the defect in the pipe and then by welding a doubler 
plate over the area. 
 
The old and new accu mulators, their connectors, and a sampl e of the piping that had been 
repaired was supplied to Quest Integrity for examination. 
 
From  the examination it was concl uded that: 
 
• The examination of the new accu mulator and new connector revealed that it was highly 
likely that the connector had been located in the accu mulator, but it had not been fully 
tightened. This was indicated by the lack of damage to the integral hexagonal sectio n 
and to the sealing faces.  However, the deformation to the larger  nut on the connector 
was consi stent with it having been screwed into another object and tightened.  
 
• The connector not being properl y tightened to the accu mulator could explain why the 
accu mulator became unscrew ed, particularly if there was significant vibration 
occu rring. This is a pos sibility with the accu mulator having been recently fitted.  
 
• The examination of the piping revealed that it was highly likely that it had leaked as a 
result of the initiation of a high cycle fatigue crack at the edge of the fillet weld between 
the piping and the square flange. This type of failure often occu rs when unsupported 
piping can resonate at its natural frequency. This may have occu rred at certain 
operational conditions at a speci fic excitation frequency. This type of failure is typically 
not directly related to the age of the piping.

 of 11 1 Introduction 
The Transp ort Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is investigating an incident where a 
fire occu rred in the engine room of fishing vesse l Amatal Enterprise . It was reported that after 
the fire was extin guished, an accu mulator on the fuel supply line to the engine was found away 
from its normal location. It appeared as if the accumul ator had become unscrewed from its 
asso ciated fitting and that the fire occurred due to the resultant fuel leakage.  
 
The accu mulator and its piping connector had recently been fitted. It was reported that the old 
accu mulator was replaced as it could not be adequately charged with nitrogen and  a leak had 
occu rred at the screw on fitting.  
 
A few days prior to the fire, a fuel line pipe had leaked next to a welded-on fitting. This had 
then been repaired, initially by welding up the defect in the pipe and then by welding a doubler 
plate over the area. 
 
The following items were supplied for examination: 
▪ New accu mulator. 
▪ New accu mulator connector. 
▪ Old accu mulator with the connector fastened in place. 
▪ A sectio n of the piping that had been repaired. 
 
The required scop e of work was to visually examine the above items to determine: 
▪ If there was any damage  to the new accu mulator and the asso ciated new accumul ator 
connector to assist in determining why the accu mulator separated from the piping. 
▪ If there wa s any damage to the connection to the old accum ulator. 
▪ If there was any evidence of the cause of the initial leak in the piping and if there was 
any evidence of leakage of the piping after the repair.

 of 11 2 Examination  
2.1 New and Old Accumulators, and Associated Fittings  
The two accumul ators are shown in Figure 1. This shows the identificatio n marking are very 
similar. The old uni t was stamped  “07/04” and the new unit was stampe d “03/06”.  
 
Examin ation of the square end o f the accumul ators showed: 
▪ There was significant loss/damage to paint in this area of the old accu mulator and no 
loss of  paint in the same  area of the new accu mulator, see Figure 2 and 3.  
▪ This loss of paint was probably due to a spanner fitted to the square end of the old 
accumul ator when the end connector was instal led. 
▪ The contrasting lack of damage to the paint on the new accu mulator is an indicatio n 
that it is unlikely that a high load had been applied to this area on the new accumul ator.  
 
Examin ation of the connector  on the old accu mulator showed: 
▪ There were significant deformation marks where spanners had been applied to the 
small integr al hexagonal sectio n (19mm across flats) on the pipe of the connector, and 
to the nut on the connector (27mm across flats), see Figure 4. This indicates that the 
connector had been fitted into the old accu mulator and onto the asso ciated piping with 
relative ly high torque s. 
▪ The connector was not removed, and it is not known how the connector sealed into the 
accu mulator, i.e. if a rubber seal was present or if it was a metal-to-metal seal. 
 
Examin ation of the end of the new accu mulator showed: 
▪ The female threads were in good undamaged condition and they had an ID of 
16.47mm. 
▪ There wa s no evidence of a thread locking agent having been applied. 
▪ A minor witness mark was presen t on the end of the accu mulator where the connector 
had been located. However, there was no surface indentation / damage marks presen t 
as would be expected to be seen if the connector had been tightly fastened into the 
accu mulator, see Figure 5. The lack of indentation/damage marks in this area suggests 
that the connector had never been fastened to the new accu mulator with a high torque .

<< Page 6 >>
 of 11 Examin ation of the new accu mulator connector showed: 
▪ It was a significantly different design to the old accumul ator connector, see Figure 6. 
▪ The male thread s of the new connector, that had become unscrewed prior to the fire, 
were in an undamaged condition and had  an OD of 17.75mm, see Figure 6. 
▪ There was no evidence of a thread  locking agent being applied to the male connector 
threads , see Figure 6.  
▪ The male end of the connector was screwed into the femal e end of the new 
accu mulator. They were a good fit, consistent with matching threads  that were correctly 
machined. The connector could be very easily screwed in or out, i.e. with a very low 
torque . 
▪ The integral hexagonal sectio n of the new accumulator connector (24mm across flats) 
was free of any contact damage , see Figure 6. This indicates that it is unlikely that this 
connector had been tightened to a relative ly high torque, even with a correctly sized 
spanner. 
▪ Conversel y, minor damage marks were presen t on the large nut on the connector 
(27mm across flats), where a spanner had been located, see Figure 6 and 7. These 
marks are consistent with a correctly sized spanner being applied with a relative ly high 
torque . 
▪ The connecting surface of the connector, that should have been in contact with the 
accu mulator, consisted of a square sectio n elastom eric seal located in a 
circumferential rectangular groove. Outside the groove was a contact ring that was 
about 1.5mm wide. The elastomeric seal and the contact ring surface were 
undamaged. See Figure 8. 
 
2.2 Piping  
Examin ation of the piping showed the piping consisted of a 28mm OD / 21.2m m ID pipe that 
had a 90-degree bend. This had been welded to 30mm  OD dimeter pipe that was then welded 
to a 70x70mm plate flange, see Figure 9. A repair doubler plate was welded to the pipe, shown 
in Figure 10. Close examination of the welding around  the doubler showed the weld was of 
good quality and that no obvious defects were present. 
 
Examin ation of the inside of the piping showed that a circumferential crack was present around 
one third of the circumference, see Figure 11. This crack was very straight and was in line with 
the edge of the original fillet weld between the pipe and the square plate flange. The form of

 of 11 the crack was classically typical of a high cycle fatigue crack that would have initiated at the 
edge of the fillet weld. The fatigue cracking was not typical of a high load low cycle fatigue 
because the crack had not opened. If a high load was applied to the piping and a crack one 
third the way around the pipe was present it would have resulted in significant opening of the 
crack and deformation.  
 
This type of high cycle fatigue cracking in piping is typical of occurring as a result vibration of 
the piping and may occur at the resonant frequency of the piping, often as a result of a lack of 
support. This type of cracking is not highly dependent on the age of the piping because the 
cracking can occu r relatively rapidly. 
 
3 Discussion / Conclusi ons 
The examination of the new accu mulator and new connector revealed that it was highly likely 
that the connector had been located in the accu mulator, but it had not been fully tightened. 
This was indicated by the lack of damage to the integr al hexagonal section where a spanner 
would normally be applied and to the sealing faces.  However, the deformation to the larger 
nut on the connector was consistent with it having been screwed into another  object and 
tightened.  
 
The connector not being properl y tightened to the accumul ator could explain why the 
accu mulator became unscrewed, particularly if there was significant vibration occu rring. This 
is possible with the accu mulator having been recently fitted.  
  
The examination of the piping revealed that it was highly likely that it had leaked as a result of 
the initiation of a high cycle fatigue crack at the edge of the fillet weld between the piping and 
the square flange. This type of failure often occu rs when unsupported piping can resonate at 
it is natural frequency. This may have occu rred at certain operational conditions at a specific 
excitation frequency. This type of failure is typically not directly related to the age of the piping.

 Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs  
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ng āti Raukawa, 
Tūwharetoa, MacDougal).  Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel for seeking 
knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A  ‘waka whai mārama’ (i te ara 
haumaru) is ‘a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding’. Waka is a metaphor for the Commission. Mārama 
(from ‘te ao mārama’ – the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku 
(Earth Mother ) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything dwelling within), which brought 
light and thus awareness to the world. ‘Te ara’ is ‘the path’ and ‘haumaru’ is ‘safe’ or ‘risk free’.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path  
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the mother 
and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete of knowledge 
that Tāne Māhuta collected from the  highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to humanity. The continual 
wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represents the individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Aviation: Ngā hau e whā - the four winds   
 
 
 
 
To Sandy, ‘Ngā hau e whā ’ (the four winds ), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents the sky, 
cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through Aotearoa’s ‘long 
white cloud’. The letter ‘A’ is present, standing for a  ‘Aviation ’.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of t his Kōwhaiwhai.  
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways  
 
 
 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different ‘ara wai’ (waterways) that ships 
sail across. The ‘V’ shape is a ship’s prow and its wake. The letter ‘M’ is present, standing for ‘Maritime.  
Sandy acknowledges Tangaroa (God of the sea) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.  
Rail: rerewhenua - flowing across the land  
 
 
 
 
 
The design represents the fluid movement of trains across Aotearoa. ‘Rere’ is to flow or fly. ‘Whenua’ is the 
land. The koru forms represent the earth, land and flora that trains pass over and through. The letter ‘R’ is 
present, standing for ‘Rail’.  
Sandy acknowledges Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) and Tāne Mahuta (God of man and forests and everything 
that dwells wi thin) in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai.
