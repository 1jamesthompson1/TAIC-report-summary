Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Engine Room Fire Risk: The report highlights the high fire risk associated with engine rooms due to the presence of fuel-fed internal combustion engines and ancillary equipment. Good design, maintenance, and crew training are crucial in managing this risk.

2. Failure of the Accumulator: The dislodging of the accumulator from its fuel pipe is identified as the source of the fuel for the fire. The report discusses factors such as the condition of the accumulator, failure of the bladder, and the absence of a supporting bracket that contributed to its failure.

3. Potential Ignition Source: While the exact ignition source for the fire could not be determined, the report suggests that the high temperature of the exhaust manifold, combined with the presence of diesel oil, could have provided the ignition source.

4. Vibration and Resonance: The report discusses the potential role of forced vibration and resonance in the unscrewing of the accumulator. The presence of vibration in the engine room, caused by operating machinery, could have contributed to the disestablishment of the steel-on-steel contact between the accumulator and its connector.

5. Maintenance and Supervision: The report identifies shortcomings in the maintenance process, particularly during port turnarounds, which did not adequately manage the risk of leaving systems in an unsafe state. The lack of rigorous checks and sign-offs for completed tasks is highlighted as a safety issue.

6. Halon System Non-Compliance: The report highlights that the Halon system on board the vessel was non-compliant with performance standards, as the Halon bottles were located in the engine room. This increased the risk of the system being compromised in the event of a fire.

7. Response to the Fire: The crew's response to the fire generally followed good industry practice, but there were lessons to be learned to improve the standard of future emergency response. Issues such as communication, reporting to emergency assembly points, and completing headcounts were identified.

8. Engine Room Exhaust Fan: The failure of the No. 2 exhaust fan to shut down during the fire hampered the crew's efforts to close down the engine room and deprive the fire of oxygen. The burnt-out shunt trip coil winding on the electrical circuit breaker for the fan was identified as the cause of the failure.

9. Halon System Availability: The decision not to activate the Halon system was reasonable at the time, but it carried a degree of risk. The report highlights the importance of having sufficient Halon gas available in case the fire escalates and the system is needed.

10. Compliance and Certification: The report raises questions about the approval and certification process for the non-compliant Halon system, as it was approved by the Lloyds Classification Society despite not meeting performance standards.

11. Maintenance and Installation Manual: The report notes the absence of specific guidance in the manufacturer's maintenance and installation manual regarding the replacement interval for the bladder of the accumulator. This lack of guidance could contribute to uncertainties in maintenance practices.
