Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Engine Room Fire Risk: The report highlights the high fire risk associated with engine rooms due to the presence of fuel-fed internal combustion engines and ancillary equipment. Good design, maintenance, and crew training are crucial in managing this risk.

2. Failure of the Accumulator: The dislodging of the accumulator from its fuel pipe is identified as the source of the fuel for the fire. The report discusses factors such as the condition of the accumulator, failure of the bladder, and the absence of a supporting bracket that contributed to its failure.

3. Potential Ignition Source: While the exact ignition source for the fire could not be determined, the report suggests that the high temperature of the exhaust manifold, combined with the presence of diesel oil, could have provided the ignition source.

4. Vibration and Resonance: The report discusses the potential role of forced vibration and resonance in the unscrewing of the accumulator. The presence of vibration in the engine room, caused by operating machinery, could have contributed to the disestablishment of the steel-on-steel contact between the accumulator and its connector.

5. Maintenance and Supervision: The report identifies shortcomings in the maintenance process, particularly during the port turnaround in Dunedin. The lack of rigorous supervision and checks during the installation of the new accumulator is highlighted as a safety issue.

6. Halon System Non-Compliance: The report raises concerns about the non-compliance of the Halon system, which was located in the engine room. The risk of the system being compromised by a fire it was installed to combat is discussed, along with the need for a compliant replacement system.

7. Response to the Fire: The crew's response to the fire is generally commended, but there are lessons to be learned to improve the standard of future emergency response. Issues such as communication, reporting to emergency assembly points, and completing headcounts are highlighted.

8. Engine Room Exhaust Fan: The failure of the No. 2 exhaust fan to shut down during the fire is identified as a safety issue. The report discusses the burnt-out shunt trip coil winding on the circuit breaker and the potential consequences of the fan continuing to operate.

9. Halon System Usage: The decision not to activate the Halon system during the fire is discussed, along with the associated risk of the system becoming partially or fully unserviceable over time.

10. Maintenance Supervision: The report highlights the need for improved supervision and control of maintenance conducted by shore contractors during port turnarounds to ensure systems are not left in an unsafe state.

11. Halon System Compliance: The non-compliance of the Halon system with performance standards and regulations is discussed, along with the need for a compliant replacement system.

12. Firefighting Response: The report acknowledges that the crew's firefighting response followed good industry practice and resulted in the successful extinguishment of the fire. However, there are lessons to be learned to improve future emergency response standards.
