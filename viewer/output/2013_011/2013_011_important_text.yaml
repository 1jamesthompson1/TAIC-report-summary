  \  \n4.1. The Int ernational Civil Aviation Organization considers a runway excursion\
  \ , which can occur \nduring take -off or landing,  to be a 'serious incident'9,\
  \ because it has  the potential to cause \nsignificant  damage and fatal injuries.\
  \  \n4.2. In this incident  there were no injuri es or damage because the crew responded\
  \ appropriately  \nand the aeroplane departed the runway at slow speed.  There was\
  \ also a flat, grassed area , \nfree of obstructions , beside the runway , which\
  \  provided a safe run -off area.  \n4.3. The following analysis discuss es what\
  \ happened  and why the steering system failed.  \nWhat happened  \n4.4. The taxi\
  \ from the parking spot, which included several tight turns, and the initial line\
  \ -up on the \nrunway were normal.  During the take -off the captain used the nose\
  \  wheel steering tiller to \ncontrol the heading and remain on the runway centreline\
  \ .  Small directional changes d uring \nthe early phase of a take-off roll  are\
  \ not unusual and can have  a number of causes , including \nstarting the take -off\
  \ with the nose  wheel not aligned with the runway  heading , an uneven \napplication\
  \ of engine power , and a crosswind.  T here was no indication of a control problem\
  \ \nuntil the aeroplane started to veer  left at about 70 knots .   \n4.5. The uncommanded\
  \ and unexpected turn to the left occurred below the take -off decision  \nspeed\
  \ .10  The captain 's decision to stop the take -off was timely  and correct . \
  \ The captain then \ncontrol led the aeroplane using  a combination of nose wheel\
  \ steering, rudder , asymmetric  \nbraking and asymmetric reverse thrust as it approached\
  \ the edge  of the r unway.  The prompt \nresponse ensure d that  the aeroplane\
  \ was at a slow speed when it left the runway . \nSteering system failure  \n4.6.\
  \ The uncommanded turn to the left was determined to have been caused by a faulty\
  \ steering \nselector.  The steering selector had been  instal led on 20 July 2012\
  \ to replace another selector \nremoved for scheduled overhaul.11  At the time of\
  \ the incident  the selector had accrued 575.7 \nhours in service over a period\
  \ of 16 months and 931 landings .  The allowable service life was \n10,000 landings\
  \  or six years, whichever came first.  \n4.7. The e xamination of the steering\
  \ selector after the incident traced the fault to incorrect  spring \ntensions within\
  \ the spring box of the steering selector , which affected the internal  hydraulic\
  \ \npressure.  This fault inter mittently allowed uncontrolled hydraulic fluid to\
  \ flow from the \nselector to the steering actuator , but only in the direction\
  \ that turned the aeroplane to the left.  \n4.8. The spring tension s and differential\
  \ pressure can only be adjusted  before  the final assembly  of \nthe steering selector\
  \  during manufacture or after  overhaul .  To ensure  that the steering \nselector\
  \ operates  as intended, it is subjected to a full functional test  after assembly\
  \ .  If the \nspring tension is incorrect, it should be identified during the fu\
  \ nctional test  and be corrected \nbefore the steering selector is released for\
  \ service.   \nSteering selector overhaul history  \n4.9. The operator  held records\
  \ for the selector that dated back to June 2006.   The steering \nselector had been\
  \  most recently overhauled in the United States by  the same  approved \noverhaul\
  \ facility  that did the examination after the occurrence .  The overhaul facility's\
  \  records \nstate d that the steering selector had been  received on 13 January\
  \ 2012, disassembled and \ncleaned.  A ll seals, O-rings a nd backing rings had\
  \ been  replaced.  There was no record that the \n                             \

  \ 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, \nAttachment C: List of\
  \ Examples of Serious Incidents.  \n10 The speed by which a decision to reject a\
  \ take-off must be made , usually referred to as V 1. \n11 The overhaul returned\
  \ the selector to an 'as new' condition.  \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -011 \n<< Page\
  \ 9 >>\n springs in the spring box  were replaced at this time .  According to the\
  \ overhaul facility the \nreuse of springs was common practice  and permitted by\
  \ the maintenance manual .  Therefore , \nit was virtually certain  that the previously\
  \ fitted  springs were reused.  On 22 May 2012 the \nselector was reassembled, tested\
  \ and \"found to be operating within all prescribed limits\".  It \nwas then returned\
  \ to the operator.  \n4.10.  The overhaul facility advised tha t it was not its\
  \ practi ce to retain test records following \nreassembly.  If a steering selector\
  \  failed the functional test, it was disassembl ed and any fault \nrectifi ed before\
  \ reassembl y and a second t est.  If the springs had been incorrectly adjusted\
  \ \nduring  the reassembly of the steering selector, this would very likely have\
  \ been detected \nduring the functional testing, which was not the case.   The overhaul\
  \ facility stated that the only \nother reason for the spring tensions to be out\
  \ of limits was that the springs had become worn \nor had lost their elasticity.\
  \  \nSimilar incident  \n4.11.  The investigation was able to identify only one\
  \ other similar occurrence.  O n 30 June 1998  a \nJetstream 31 was taking off from\
  \ London (Stansted) Airport in England when it star ted to veer \nto the left. \
  \ The pilot was unable to correct the left veer and the aeroplane ran off the side\
  \ of \nthe runway .12   \n4.12.  The investigation of that occurrence had determined\
  \ the fault to be \"worn rocker spring \nplunger s\" in the steering selector .\
  \  (The s prings and rocker spring plungers are both contained \nwithin the steering\
  \ selector and work in conjunction, but are separate components.)  The wear \nresulted\
  \ in excess clearances that resulted in a small valve offset and allowed fluid to\
  \ \ncontinue to flow to the actuator.  This prevented the rocker returning to a\
  \ null position from \nleft steer input s by the pilot.  As a result  of that incident\
  \ , the aeroplane manufacturer had \namended the time between overhaul s of the\
  \ ste ering selector from 10,000 hours to 10,000  \nlandings or six years, whichever\
  \ came first.13  \nThe 2 November 2013 failure  \n4.13.  The fault was confirmed\
  \ as originating in the steering selector.  The overhaul facility stated  \nthat\
  \ the fault was with the springs and in its experience an isolated occurrence. \
  \ However, \nBritish Aerospace stated that there was \"no data that suggests any\
  \ issue with the life of the \nspring[s]\". The aeroplane manufacturer further advised\
  \ that the  manufacturer of the steering  \nselector had stated that since 2006\
  \ it had not had to replace the springs  because of fatigue or \nany other fault\
  \ .   \n4.14.  Because the overhaul facility's test and inspection reports lacked\
  \ sufficient detail, i t could not \nbe determined whether the springs or the rocker\
  \  spring plungers  were the cause of the \nsteering incident at Auckland .   \n\
  4.15.  This occurrence was the only recorded  such failure of a steering selector\
  \ since 1998.  \nTherefore there was insufficient evidence to warrant a change in\
  \ maintenance practices \nbeyond the change s made  in 1999.        \n  \n     \

  \  \n5.1. The uncommanded turn to the left during take -off was caused by a faulty\
  \ steering selector.  \n5.2. The defective component within  the steering selector\
  \ could not be determined  because of \nincomplete overhaul records . \n5.3. The\
  \ isolated nature of the component failure  in this occurrence,  and the actions\
  \ the \nmanufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to\
  \ the relevant \nmaintenance procedures were not warranted.      \n \n \n  \n \n\
