- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 100
  explanation: The incident was caused by a faulty steering selector, which had been installed after an overhaul (4.6).

The maintenance and inspection regimes are directly implicated as the overhaul facility's records did not indicate that the springs in the spring box were replaced, and it was virtually certain that the previously fitted springs were reused (4.9). Additionally, the overhaul facility's test and inspection reports lacked sufficient detail to determine the cause of the steering incident (4.14).
