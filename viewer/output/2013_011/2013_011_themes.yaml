- name: Runway Excursions
  explanation: 'Runway excursions are events where an aircraft departs the runway during takeoff or landing and are considered ''serious incidents'' due to their potential to cause significant damage and fatal injuries ("Runway excursions" 4.1). This theme is relevant to the accident because the incident involved an uncommanded turn during takeoff, which led to the aircraft leaving the runway, albeit without injuries or damage due to the crew''s appropriate response and the presence of a safe run-off area ("In this incident there were no injuries or damage because the crew responded appropriately and the aeroplane departed the runway at slow speed" 4.2).

- name: Steering System Failure
  explanation: 'Steering system failure is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the pilot''s ability to control the aircraft during ground operations. In this incident, the uncommanded turn to the left was caused by a faulty steering selector ("The uncommanded turn to the left was determined to have been caused by a faulty steering selector" 4.6). The failure of the steering system is particularly relevant to this accident as it was the primary cause of the runway excursion.

- name: Maintenance and Overhaul Practices
  explanation: 'Maintenance and overhaul practices are essential for ensuring the reliability of aircraft components. The steering selector involved in this incident had been overhauled, but the overhaul records did not indicate that the springs in the spring box were replaced ("There was no record that the springs in the spring box were replaced at this time" 4.9). The overhaul facility''s practice of not retaining detailed test records also contributed to the inability to determine the defective component within the steering selector ("Because the overhaul facility''s test and inspection reports lacked sufficient detail, it could not be determined whether the springs or the rocker spring plungers were the cause of the steering incident at Auckland" 4.14). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of thorough maintenance records and practices in preventing component failures.

- name: Component Life Cycle Management
  explanation: 'Managing the life cycle of aircraft components is crucial to prevent failures due to wear and tear. The steering selector had an allowable service life of 10,000 landings or six years, whichever came first, and the incident occurred after 931 landings over 16 months ("The allowable service life was 10,000 landings or six years, whichever came first" 4.6). The relevance of this theme is underscored by the fact that the springs, which were suspected to have caused the fault, were reused during the last overhaul and were not replaced due to common practice and maintenance manual permissions ("According to the overhaul facility the reuse of springs was common practice and permitted by the maintenance manual" 4.9).

    '
- name: Incident Response and Crew Training
  explanation: 'The response of the crew to an incident and their training are critical safety themes. In this case, the captain''s decision to stop the take-off was timely and correct, and the crew''s control of the aircraft using various methods ensured that the airplane was at a slow speed when it left the runway ("The captain''s decision to stop the take-off was timely and correct" 4.5). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the importance of crew training and decision-making in mitigating the consequences of an incident.

- name: Component Failure Analysis and Reporting
  explanation: The analysis and reporting of component failures are vital for understanding the causes of incidents and preventing future occurrences. In this incident, the fault was traced to incorrect spring tensions within the steering selector, which affected the internal hydraulic pressure ("The examination of the steering selector after the incident traced the fault to incorrect spring tensions within the spring box of the steering selector" 4.7). However, due to incomplete overhaul records, the specific defective component could not be determined ("The defective component within the steering selector could not be determined because of incomplete overhaul records" 5.2). This theme is relevant as it highlights the need for detailed failure analysis and reporting to enhance safety through better understanding and prevention of component failures.
