The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents  and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
under taken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 2 November 2013 a British Aerospace  Jetstream 32  aeroplane  taking off  from Auckland 
Airport started to veer left from the runway centreline.  The captain was initially able to co rrect  
the heading change , but at about 90 knots the turn became unc ontrollable.  The aeroplane 
slowly ran off the left side of the runway before the captain could bring it to a stop.  No-one 
was injured and there was no  damage  to the aeroplane or any airport infrastructure . 
1.2. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) made the following findings : 
 the uncommanded turn to the left during take -off was caused by a faulty steering selector  
 the defective component within  the steering s elector could not be determined  because of 
incomplete overhaul records  
 the isolated nature of the component failure in this occurrence, and the actions the 
manufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to the relevant 
maintenance procedures were not warranted.  
1.3. The Commission made no recommendation  as a result of its inquiry.   
1.4. The key lesson  identified  from the inquiry into this occurrence w as: 
 prompt action by a pilot on recognising a loss of directional control during take -off or 
landing will minimise the risk of a runway excursion .

 Final report AO -2013 -011 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  notified the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission (Commission) of the incident at 1520 on Saturday 2 November 2013 , 
approximately 20 minutes after it had  occurred.  The Commission gave p ermission for the 
aeroplane to be removed from the side of the runway and to be taken to a secure hangar.  
Two Commission investigators travelled to Auckland the next day to examin e the aeroplane .   
2.2. The steering jack and steering selector, t wo components of the nose  wheel steering system , 
were removed and sent to repair and overhaul facilities in the United States for examination.  
Samples of the steering system h ydraulic f luid w ere taken for analysis .  The flight data 
recorder was sent to a facility in Sydney, Austra lia, for downloading.   Relevant records were 
obtained from a ir traffic control and the aerodrome operator . 
2.3. On 4 November 2013 the two pilots were interviewed at  the operator's base in  Wellington , 
and various  aeroplane and operator records  obtained.  
2.4. In early 2014 the reports on the examinations of  the two steering components were received 
and follow -up enquiries were made . 
2.5. On 28 September 2016  the Commission approved this report for circulation to interested 
persons for comment.   One submission was re ceived and the final report has considered that 
submission . 
2.6. On 22 February 2017  the Commission approved this  final report for publication .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. The flight  
3.1.1.  On Saturday 2 November 2013, a British Aerospace2 Jetstream 32 ZK-VAH (the aeroplane) 
was being used for scheduled services to and from Auckland .  At about midday a  replacement 
crew arrived from Wellington to complete the remainder of the day's flying .  The outgoing crew 
informed the replacement crew that there were  no fault s or concerns  with the aeroplane . 
3.1.2.  At 1455, with 14 passengers  on board , the engines were started  for a flight to Taupo .  A tight 
turn to the left through about 180º was required in order to leave  the terminal parking area.  
The captain said a combination of full nose  wheel steering, asymmetric power3 and 
asymmetric brak ing was  required to turn  the aeroplane . The aeroplane was then taxied to 
runway 23  Left (see Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1 
Taxi path  to the runway  
3.1.3.  At about  1501 the aeroplane was given clearance to take  off.  The weather was fine with a 
light crosswind from the left.  The captain said that the power was increased progressively on 
both engines and the aeroplane accelerate d normally.  She kept the aeroplane on the runway 
centreline initially by the use of nose  wheel steering.  
3.1.4.  After the first officer had made the standard '70 knots '4 airspeed  check call , the captain 
transferred direc tional control from the nose  wheel steering to the rudder pedals.  At about 
this time the crew notic ed a slight swing to the left .  This was corrected  by applying some right 
rudder .  The aeroplane subsequently start ed to veer left again .  The captain  was unable to 
counter the second veer to the left using full right rudder, and the aeroplane drifted towards 
the edge of the runway . 
3.1.5.  The captain called "stopping " as she  closed both power  levers .  She then u sed a combination 
of nose  wheel steering and asymmetric braking to try to keep  the aeroplane on the runway.  
The first officer relayed the "stopping" call to the control tower  during this time .  The aeroplane 
came  to a stop in the grass about 15 metres (m) from the runway  (see Figure 2) .

arrived.  No-one was injured and there was no  damage to the aeroplane or ground 
installations as a result of the runway  excursion .5  The aeroplane was later towed to a hangar  
to await the arrival of Commission investigators.

3.2. Personnel information  
3.2.1.  The captain held an air transport pilot licence (aeroplane) issued in 2007 and a current class 
one medical certificate.  She had obtained her Jetstream 32 type rating in November 2005  
and joined the operator in July 2012 as a captain .  At the time of the oc currence she had 
accrued 5,131 flight hours, including 2 ,212 hours on the Jetstream 32.  
3.2.2.  The captain 's previous  line check had been  on 18 June 2013.  She  had flown  22 hours in the 
preceding 30 days and 2.2 hours in the preceding seven  days.  She had had a rest day on the 
day before the occurrence and said that s he had been  well rested and fit to fly  on the day of 
the occurrence . 
3.2.3.  The first officer held a commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) issued in 2008, and a current 
class one medical certificate.   He had obtained his Jetstream 32 rating in September 2012, 
soon after joining the operator.  At the time of the occurrence the first officer had accrued 
1,250 fl ight hours, including 320 hours on the Jetstream 32.  
3.2.4.  The first officer's previous  line check had been  on 17 December 2012.   He had flown  32 
hours in the 30 days preceding the occurrence  and 10 hours in the preceding seven days.  
The two days prior to the occurrence had been  free of duty .  He said he had been  well rested 
and fit to fly on the day of the occ urrence .

 3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  The Jetstream 32 was a development of the Jetstream 31 that had been  first certificated in 
1982.  It was powered by two Garrett AiResearch6 TPE331 turbo -propeller engines and 
capable of carrying a two -pilot crew and 19 passengers.  
3.3.2.  The aeroplane had been  manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1992 and flown for seven 
years in the United States  before being sold to an operator in New Zealand and  then to one in 
Australia .  In June 2012 the aeroplane had been  returned to New Zealand , registered as ZK -
VAH and join ed with three other Jetstream aeroplanes in the operator 's fleet .7 
3.3.3.  Nose wheel steering was controlled through a tiller (handle) located on  the left side of the 
cockpit next to the captain's seat.  A mechanical linkage connected the tiller to the steering 
selector, which directed hydraulic pressure to a steering actuator mounted on the nose gear 
housing (see Figure 3).  The actuator turned th e nose wheel.  A feedback loop ensured that 
the nose wheel position matched the tiller movement and position.  
Maintenance defect history  
3.3.4.  On 8 February  2013, 10 months before the incident , a pilot had reported that during take -off 
the aeroplane "yawed [turned] left significantly".  Full right rudder had been  used to keep the 
aeroplane aligned with the runway.  During an examination of the aeroplane a nose  wheel axle 
nut was found to be cracked and the steering jack determined to be faulty.  Th ose items were 
replaced .  No other fault was found with the  steering system , so the aeroplane was returned to 
service .  At the time it  had flown 18,724 hours and completed 29,646 landings ( cycles ). 
3.3.5.  On 9 August 2013,  three months before the incident , a crew had repor ted that during take -off 
the aeroplane drifted left .  Loose play was found in several components of the nose wheel 
steering system .  The steering jack was bled  of any trapped air and the main wheel brake units 
were swapped around.  The flight deck steering  hand le was also replaced.  Testing was unable 
to replicate the problem and the aeroplane was returned to service.  P ilots were asked to 
report any further concerns .  On 18 October 2013, two months before the incident , with no 
furthe r problems reported, th e defect was recorded as rectified . 
3.3.6.  On the day of the occurrence, 2 November 2013, the aeroplane had accrued 18,909 fl ight 
hours and 29,978 landings.  
3.4. Recorder information  
3.4.1.  The aeroplane was fitted with a flight data recorder  that recorded 11 parameters , including 
the heading, airspeed and the torque and propeller  speed of both engines .  The recorder was 
removed and sent for downloading of the data .  The cockpit voice recorder was not accessed.  
3.4.2.  The data show ed that the first veer to the left occurred as the aeroplane speed approached 
about 7 0 knots.  The second veer left started at about 90 knots. The engine power  was 
reduced to flight idle at about  100 knots.  
3.4.3.  The data show ed that power was increased simultaneously on both engines for the take -off 
and th at there was no asymmetric power  as the aeroplane accelerated.  After the captain 
commenced the rejected take -off, more reverse power was applied to the right engine than to 
the left engine  as the captain  attempt ed to turn the aeroplane back to the right.   
3.4.4.  Aerodrome ground surveillance data showed that during the attempted take -off the aeroplane 
maintained the runway centreline for about 200 m before starting to move left.  The move to 
the left was corrected for about 100 m and the aeroplane was returned to near the centreline ,

7 In October 2014 the operator ceased all operations . 
 

<< Page 6 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -011 where it stayed for about the next 200 m.  The aeroplane then veered increasingly to the left 
and ran off the runway about 600 m from the start of the take -off roll.  
3.5. Testing  of nose  wheel steering system  
3.5.1.  An initial examination of the a eroplane identified no engine, main undercarriage or brake 
system anomalies.  T he focus of the investigation then moved to the nose  wheel steering 
system . 
3.5.2.  The nose  wheel was placed on a greased plate to enable it to turn easily while it supported a 
normal load.  The hydraulic system was then pressurised.  Repeated movement s of the nose  
wheel tiller were  unable to produce  an uncommanded left turn.  No abnormalities were 
identified  by this test . 
3.5.3.  Samples of hydraulic f luid were taken  for analysis, including from the hydraulic line close to 
where the steering jack and steering selector were located.  The samples were subjected to a 
spectroscopic analysis , which confirmed that the fluid was of the correct type with no 
anomalies.  
3.5.4.  The steering jack and steering sel ector were then removed for detailed examination by two 
different approved overhaul facilities  in the United States . 
 
Figure 3 
Steering components  
(looking rearward)  
3.5.5.  A functional check and disassembly of the steering jack found no fault that may have 
contributed to the uncommanded left turn.  
3.5.6.  The overhaul facility  that examined the steering selector  identified two related faults during 
testing .  Following "full counter -clockwise input to the selector, upon release the valve would 
stick and allow fluid to continually flow from [a] port "8; and "excessive internal valve leakage 
was observed" .  The overhaul facility then  disassembl ed the selector and found that the faults 
were caused by 'spring  boxes' being out of adjustment .  The spring boxes balance d the 
hydraulic pressure between the control pressure commanded by the pilot and the resultant 
steering forces  from the nose wheel position .   
3.5.7.  The overhaul facility stated that b ecause the steering selector locking tabs were still intact  
before disassembly , the misadjustment " must have been  directly related to the springs ".  
These faults would direct hydraulic pressure to go to the left -turn side of the steering actuator .  
The overhaul facility further commented in its report that "the probable cause of the spring

 boxes being out of adjustment is due to fatigue of the spring" and that from its experience this 
was "an isolated incident ".

 Final report AO -2013 -011 4. Analysis  
Runway excursions  
4.1. The Int ernational Civil Aviation Organization considers a runway excursion , which can occur 
during take -off or landing,  to be a 'serious incident'9, because it has  the potential to cause 
significant  damage and fatal injuries.  
4.2. In this incident  there were no injuri es or damage because the crew responded appropriately  
and the aeroplane departed the runway at slow speed.  There was also a flat, grassed area , 
free of obstructions , beside the runway , which  provided a safe run -off area.  
4.3. The following analysis discuss es what happened  and why the steering system failed.  
What happened  
4.4. The taxi from the parking spot, which included several tight turns, and the initial line -up on the 
runway were normal.  During the take -off the captain used the nose  wheel steering tiller to 
control the heading and remain on the runway centreline .  Small directional changes d uring 
the early phase of a take-off roll  are not unusual and can have  a number of causes , including 
starting the take -off with the nose  wheel not aligned with the runway  heading , an uneven 
application of engine power , and a crosswind.  T here was no indication of a control problem 
until the aeroplane started to veer  left at about 70 knots .   
4.5. The uncommanded and unexpected turn to the left occurred below the take -off decision  
speed .10  The captain 's decision to stop the take -off was timely  and correct .  The captain then 
control led the aeroplane using  a combination of nose wheel steering, rudder , asymmetric  
braking and asymmetric reverse thrust as it approached the edge  of the r unway.  The prompt 
response ensure d that  the aeroplane was at a slow speed when it left the runway . 
Steering system failure  
4.6. The uncommanded turn to the left was determined to have been caused by a faulty steering 
selector.  The steering selector had been  instal led on 20 July 2012 to replace another selector 
removed for scheduled overhaul.11  At the time of the incident  the selector had accrued 575.7 
hours in service over a period of 16 months and 931 landings .  The allowable service life was 
10,000 landings  or six years, whichever came first.  
4.7. The e xamination of the steering selector after the incident traced the fault to incorrect  spring 
tensions within the spring box of the steering selector , which affected the internal  hydraulic 
pressure.  This fault inter mittently allowed uncontrolled hydraulic fluid to flow from the 
selector to the steering actuator , but only in the direction that turned the aeroplane to the left.  
4.8. The spring tension s and differential pressure can only be adjusted  before  the final assembly  of 
the steering selector  during manufacture or after  overhaul .  To ensure  that the steering 
selector operates  as intended, it is subjected to a full functional test  after assembly .  If the 
spring tension is incorrect, it should be identified during the fu nctional test  and be corrected 
before the steering selector is released for service.   
Steering selector overhaul history  
4.9. The operator  held records for the selector that dated back to June 2006.   The steering 
selector had been  most recently overhauled in the United States by  the same  approved 
overhaul facility  that did the examination after the occurrence .  The overhaul facility's  records 
state d that the steering selector had been  received on 13 January 2012, disassembled and 
cleaned.  A ll seals, O-rings a nd backing rings had been  replaced.  There was no record that the

 springs in the spring box  were replaced at this time .  According to the overhaul facility the 
reuse of springs was common practice  and permitted by the maintenance manual .  Therefore , 
it was virtually certain  that the previously fitted  springs were reused.  On 22 May 2012 the 
selector was reassembled, tested and "found to be operating within all prescribed limits".  It 
was then returned to the operator.  
4.10.  The overhaul facility advised tha t it was not its practi ce to retain test records following 
reassembly.  If a steering selector  failed the functional test, it was disassembl ed and any fault 
rectifi ed before reassembl y and a second t est.  If the springs had been incorrectly adjusted 
during  the reassembly of the steering selector, this would very likely have been detected 
during the functional testing, which was not the case.   The overhaul facility stated that the only 
other reason for the spring tensions to be out of limits was that the springs had become worn 
or had lost their elasticity.  
Similar incident  
4.11.  The investigation was able to identify only one other similar occurrence.  O n 30 June 1998  a 
Jetstream 31 was taking off from London (Stansted) Airport in England when it star ted to veer 
to the left.  The pilot was unable to correct the left veer and the aeroplane ran off the side of 
the runway .12   
4.12.  The investigation of that occurrence had determined the fault to be "worn rocker spring 
plunger s" in the steering selector .  (The s prings and rocker spring plungers are both contained 
within the steering selector and work in conjunction, but are separate components.)  The wear 
resulted in excess clearances that resulted in a small valve offset and allowed fluid to 
continue to flow to the actuator.  This prevented the rocker returning to a null position from 
left steer input s by the pilot.  As a result  of that incident , the aeroplane manufacturer had 
amended the time between overhaul s of the ste ering selector from 10,000 hours to 10,000  
landings or six years, whichever came first.13  
The 2 November 2013 failure  
4.13.  The fault was confirmed as originating in the steering selector.  The overhaul facility stated  
that the fault was with the springs and in its experience an isolated occurrence.  However, 
British Aerospace stated that there was "no data that suggests any issue with the life of the 
spring[s]". The aeroplane manufacturer further advised that the  manufacturer of the steering  
selector had stated that since 2006 it had not had to replace the springs  because of fatigue or 
any other fault .   
4.14.  Because the overhaul facility's test and inspection reports lacked sufficient detail, i t could not 
be determined whether the springs or the rocker  spring plungers  were the cause of the 
steering incident at Auckland .   
4.15.  This occurrence was the only recorded  such failure of a steering selector since 1998.  
Therefore there was insufficient evidence to warrant a change in maintenance practices 
beyond the change s made  in 1999.

 Final report AO -2013 -011 5. Findings  
5.1. The uncommanded turn to the left during take -off was caused by a faulty steering selector.  
5.2. The defective component within  the steering selector could not be determined  because of 
incomplete overhaul records . 
5.3. The isolated nature of the component failure  in this occurrence,  and the actions the 
manufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to the relevant 
maintenance procedures were not warranted.

 Final report AO -2013 -011 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Nil.

 8. Recommendation  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safe ty issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case no recommendation was made .

9.1. Prompt action by a pilot on recognising a loss of directional control during take -off or landing 
will minimise the risk of a runway excursion .
