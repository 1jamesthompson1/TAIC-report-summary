  \ train's event recorder confirmed that the train driver had the tr ain \ncomplying\
  \ with all applicable rail system requirements as it approached the level crossing\
  \ , \nincluding the authorised line speed . \n4.1.2.  An examination of the truck\
  \ following the accident did not identify any pre-existing mechanical \nfault that\
  \ could have contributed to the accident.  However, the extent of the damage to\
  \ the \ntruck  meant that the possibility could not be excluded.  \n4.1.3.  The\
  \ Commission concluded that it was very likely  that the truck did not stop before\
  \ proceeding \nover the level crossing.  However, even if it had done so, there\
  \ would have been  an insufficient \nsighting distance  available to the driver\
  \ to clear the level crossing had the train been just out \nof view.  This conclusion\
  \ and safety issue are discussed in mo re detail in the following \nanalysis.  \n\
  4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  Data  downloaded from the truck 's global positioning\
  \ system  (GPS) -based road -user-charge \nsystem (e -ruc)12 showed that the truck\
  \  entered Lambert Road from the s tate highway at \n1123:44  and travelled southbound,\
  \ stopping periodically to service waste bins . \n4.2.2.  Figure 8 shows  the locations\
  \ at which the truck 's speed dropped to less  than four kilometres \nper hour (recorded\
  \ as the truck having stopped).  Each of these stoppages corresponded to a n \n\
  address where a waste bin had been positioned on the roadside.  The data show ed\
  \ that the \ntruck stopped to service bins either side of the level crossing, but\
  \ did not stop at the level \ncrossing, which was protected by a compulsory stop\
  \ sign . \n4.2.3.  The truck con tinued south to the end of Lambert Road, turned\
  \ around and proceeded \nnorthbound, stopping to service bins positioned on the\
  \ other side of the road.   The last \nrecorded stop was made at 1131:02, when the\
  \ truck  was 126 metres from the level crossing.  \n                           \
  \                             \n12 A management tool that records  the times and\
  \ locations of vehicle events. such as when a vehicle's \nignition is turned on\
  \ and off, the vehicle enters and/or exits a geo -fenced site, the vehicle turns\
  \ or the vehicle \nis stopped, and the vehicle's speed and GPS location, at predetermined\
  \ t ime intervals.  The system \ndetermines that the vehicle has stopped when its\
  \ speed falls to less than four kilometres per hour.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final\

  \ 13 >>\n 4.2.4.  The train and the truck  collided  at 1131:33 according to the\
  \ train event recorder, about  \n31 seconds after the truck had last stopped14.\
  \  The post -accident examination of the truck \ninstrument panel identified that\
  \ the speedometer had 'captured' the speed  at about  \n48 kilometres per hour and\
  \ the tachometer  similarly 'captured'  the revs at 1,700 revolutions \nper minute\
  \  (see Figure 9).  The speed and rev counter readings were  likely to have been\
  \ the \nreadings when power was lost to the instrument panel as a result of the\
  \ collision.  Therefore, \nthe truck was likely to have been travelling at close\
  \ to 48 kilometres per hour  at the time of \nimpact.  \n \nFigure 9 \nThe truck\
  \  instrument panel after the collision  \n(photograph courtesy of New Zealand Police)\
  \  \n4.2.5.  The data downloaded from the train's event recorder showed that it\
  \ was travelling at about  \n63 kilometres  per hour when the train driver sounded\
  \ the locomotive whistle at 1 131:25, \nwarning road users of the train's  approach.\
  \  The train was about 141 metres from the level \ncrossing when the driver activated\
  \ the whistle.  \n4.2.6.  The driver of the train said that the truck was first\
  \ seen when it was just about to enter the \nlevel crossing directly in front of\
  \ the train .  There was  no time to drop down into the 'safe \nposition' between\
  \ the brake pedestal and the rear wall of the locomotive cab15 or to take any \n\
  other preven tive action . \n4.2.7.  Similarly, there was no evidence in the form\
  \ of skid marks to suggest  that the truck driver \nbecame aware of the train in\
  \ time to take preventive action . \n4.2.8.  It was very unlikely that the truck\
  \ stopped before entering the level crossing  because of  the \nfollowing factors\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 the speed at which the truck appeared in front of the train driver\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the truck speed and engine revs captured on the truck's instrument panel\
  \  \n                                                        \n14 It was not possible\
  \ to validate with absolute accuracy the times obta ined from the train event recorder\
  \ \nagainst those obtained from the truck e -ruc system.  \n15 Drivers are taught\
  \ to place themselves into this position in the event of an imminent collision.\
  \  \n\n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -105 \uF0B7 the fact that , shortly\
  \ beforehand, the truck had not stop ped before entering the \nsame level crossing\
  \ when travelling southbound on Lambert Road . \n4.2.9.  It was virtually certain\
  \ that the truck driver was aware of the level crossing.  The various \nwarning\
  \ signposts and paint markings on the road were in good condition and in accordance\
  \ \nwith the railway and  road authority standards.  Also, the truck  driver had\
  \ worked Lambert \nRoad many time s before , so would have been well aware of the\
  \ level crossing's presence . \n4.2.10.  The Commission considered other possible\
  \ reasons for the truck driver not stop ping at the \nlevel cr ossing . \n4.2.11.\
  \  The toxicology results showed that there  was no impair ment .  It was unlikely\
  \ that the truck \ndriver was  fatigued because  the work involved  day shifts only\
  \ , and the driver had only recently \nreturned to work from having been on leave.\
  \  The driver was frequently starting and stopping \nthe truck with the high degree\
  \ of precision required to service the waste bins.  Th is suggested \nthat the driver\
  \ was  alert at the time and unlikely to have fallen asleep.  \n4.2.12.  Mobile\
  \ phones are known to be common source s of distraction.  However, the driver's\
  \ phone \nwas recovered and the phone records established that the phone  was not\
  \ being used at the \ntime of the accident . \n4.2.13.  The Commission could only\
  \ conclude that the driver did not consistently stop at the level \ncrossing . \
  \ One explanation for the driver not stopping  was a low expectation of encountering\
  \ a \ntrain at the level crossing .   \n4.2.14.  With an average eight  trains each\
  \ day, the frequency of trains travelling through the level \ncrossing was not high.\
  \  At the time of day that  the driver would normally have been working \nLambert\
  \ Road, the KiwiRail master train control plan had two trains passing through the\
  \ area, \nwith a possible 55 minutes between trains.  It is not known if the truck\
  \ driver had ever \npreviously  encountered a tra in at the level crossing  while\
  \ working along Lambert Road or was \naware of the train running times.  \n4.2.15.\
  \  Freight  trains do not run to strict schedule s and road users must expect train\
  \ s at any time.  On \nthe day of the accident , train services on the Murupara\
  \ Bra nch line were running about 30 \nminutes ahead of the train control plan.\
  \  \n4.3. Survivability  \n4.3.1.  The dual -control truck was being operated from\
  \ the left -hand seat at th e time of the collision , \nwhich was where the train\
  \ first hit the truck .  Waste Management's Safe Driving Policy  \nrequired seatbelts\
  \ to be worn at all times .  After the accident the seatbelt was found to be \n\
  unlocked .  It was therefore unlikely that the driver was wearing a seatbelt at\
  \ the time of \nimpact .   \n4.3.2.  It could not be determined whether the driver\
  \ w ould have survived had  a seatbelt  been worn .  \nNevertheless, wearing a seatbelt\
  \ will generally increase the chances of  a person  surviving an \naccident , which\
  \ is a lesson arising from this inquiry.  \n4.4. Sighting distance at the level\
  \ crossing  \nSafety issue - Sighting distances  for road users at level crossings\
  \ are one of the factors used \nto determine the appropriate level of protection\
  \ required, yet  the growth  in vegetation around \nrailway level crossings can\
  \ change sighting distance s in a relative ly short time and render the \nlevel\
  \ crossing s unsafe . \n4.4.1.  Level crossings are different from  roads in that\
  \ the overall risk profile is skewed towards a low -\nprobability but high -consequence\
  \ event.  As such, level crossings are protected through the \nuse of appropri ate\
  \ traffic control devices.  The devices installed are dependent on a range of \n\
  factors including:  \n \n \nFinal Report RO -2017 -105 \n<< Page 15 >>\n \uF0B7\
  \ the level crossing type  \n\uF0B7 the volume and speed of rail and road traffic\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the mix of road and rail traffic using the level crossing  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the alignment of the road ap proach to the level crossing  \n\uF0B7 other physical\
  \ attributes of the level crossing and its surrounds . \n4.4.2.  There are  1,388\
  \ public road level crossings on the national rail network .  Of those public road\
  \ \nlevel crossings , 715 (52%) have active protection .  There are 41 9 crossings\
  \ protected by \nflashing lights and bells and 296 have half -arm barriers and flashing\
  \ lights and bells.  The \nother 673 public road  level crossings are all protected\
  \ with passive signs, either 'Give Way' or \n'Stop'  signs .  The Lambert Road public\
  \ road level crossing is one of 393 protected with 'Stop' \nsignage.   \n4.4.3.\
  \  The Australian Level Crossing Assessment Model (ALCAM) is an assessment tool\
  \ adopted by \nNew Zealand that is  used to identify key potential risks at all\
  \ level crossings and to assist in \nthe prioritisation of level crossings for upgrade.\
  \  The ALCAM process involves collecting data \nby way of level crossing site surveys\
  \ , and collecting both train and road data  from the \nrespective rail and road\
  \ authorities.  The ALCAM assessment  output data showe d that the \nLambert Road\
  \ public road level crossing presented a relatively low risk ; it rated 965 out\
  \ of \n1,388 public road level crossings on the rail network . \n4.4.4.  Passive\
  \ controls are generally used where there are low volumes of both road and rail\
  \ traffic , \nwhich make the likelihood of a collision low.  The Lambert Road public\
  \ road level crossing met \nthe requirement for passive controls, having  six to\
  \ eight daily rail movements and an average \nof 36 vehicle movements passing over\
  \ the level crossing each day.  St op sign s are used at \nthose level crossings\
  \  where the road user has insufficient time to sight an approaching train \nand\
  \ stop before reachin g the level crossing limit line.  \n4.4.5.  The most recent\
  \ ALCAM site survey at the Lambert Road level crossing had been carried  out \n\
  on 18 June 2011.  The survey had reviewed the road traffic control measure s in\
  \ place and \nrecorded various parameters that included  the: \n\uF0B7 width of\
  \ the road  \n\uF0B7 maximum distance between the limit line and the closest rail\
  \  \n\uF0B7 angle between the roadway and the railway track  \n\uF0B7 road approach\
  \ gradient  \n\uF0B7 maximum sighting distance available from the road user's eye\
  \ position , taken from \none and a half metres behind the limit line.   \n4.4.6.\
  \  The survey data was then used to calculate the minimum sighting distance that\
  \ a road user \nrequire d to clear the level crossing safely ahead of an approaching\
  \ train.  The measured and \ncalculated sighting distances were compared to determine\
  \ what , if any , corrective action was \nrequired.  Appendix 1 sets out the procedure\
  \ for calculating sigh ting distances at level \ncrossings.  \n4.4.7.  For the northbound\
  \ approach to the level crossing , the calculated minimum re -start sighting \n\
  distance required for a truck of the type involved in this accident was 183 metres.\
  \  That \ndistance compared favourably with the 4 23 metre s of available sighting\
  \ distance recorded at \nthe time of the ALCAM survey.   \n4.4.8.  During the seven\
  \ years since th e ALCAM survey , vegetation on the boundary of a private \nproperty\
  \ adjacent to  the level crossing had grown to a height of about two metres .  As\
  \ a result , \nthe maximum sighting distance available to the truck  driver had\
  \ been reduced from  \n423 metres to 83 metres (see Figure 10).  This meant that\
  \ even if the truck had  stopped at \nthe yellow limit line, the truck  driver would\
  \ not have had sufficient  time to clear the level \ncrossing  safely  in the event\
  \ of a train approaching from just out of the driver 's view . \n \n\n<< Page 16\
  \ >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -105 4.4.9.  Furthermore, even if the  driver had tried\
  \ to look for trains as the truck approached the level \ncrossing , the train would\
  \ have been obscured by a high hedge that ran parallel to the road.  \n \nFigure\
  \ 10 \nThe view looking east towards Kawerau  when stopped at the yellow limit line\

  4.4.10.  Subsequent to the accident KiwiRail worked with the owner of the adjacent\
  \ property to \nimprove the sighting distance (see Figure 11).  \n\n \nFinal Report\
  \ RO -2017 -105 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.4.11.  Maintaining sighting distances at level\
  \ crossings is critical for the safety of road users.  While \nmost of the factors\
  \ that are considered when deciding on the  level of protection to give a level\
  \ \ncrossing are unlikely  to change significantly  over time, vege tation growth\
  \ can relatively quickly \nrender a level crossing unsafe.  \n4.5. Responsibility\
  \  for maintaining sighting distance s at public road level crossings  \nSafety\
  \ issue -The legislation is not clear on the allocation  of responsibility between\
  \  licensed \nrail acces s providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring\
  \ the safety of road and rail \nusers at public road level crossings.   \n4.5.1.\
  \  As the main rail access provider, KiwiRail maintained a program me for controlling\
  \ vegetation \naround the public road level crossings within its rail corridor .\
  \  However, the mechanisms for \ncontrolling road traffic at level crossings are\
  \ diverse.  In this example , one or more of the \nfollowing mechanisms could have\
  \ been used to ensure the safety of road vehicles and rail \nvehicles at the Lambert\
  \ Road  level crossing:  \n\uF0B7 remove the vegetation to improve the sighting\
  \ distance  at the level crossing  \n\uF0B7 improve the view lines  for vehicles\
  \ approaching the level crossing so that a 'Give Way' \nsign could be used instead\
  \ of a 'Stop ' sign \n\uF0B7 reduce the speed of trains over the level crossing\
  \ to allow long vehicles stopped at the \nlevel crossing sufficient time to cross\
  \ safely  \n\uF0B7 install active level crossing protection.  \n4.5.2.  Level crossings\
  \ are the intersection of two jurisdictions : the rail access pro vider and the\
  \ road \ncontrolling authority.  Relevant legislation16 is not clear about what\
  \ entity or entities have \nultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety of both\
  \ rail users  and road users  at public road \nlevel crossings.  \n4.5.3.  The Commission\
  \ has raised a s imilar issue in it s watchlist item 'Safety for pedestrians and\
  \ \nvehicles using level crossings', which highlight s that the safety of pedestrians\
  \ and vehicles \nusing level crossings has been compromised because of ambiguities\
  \ in the responsibilities of \nroad a nd rail authorities.  \n4.5.4.  The Commission\
  \ is recommending that , in the long term, the NZ Transport Agency take action \n\
  to clarify the responsibilities of licensed rail access providers and road controlling\
  \ authorities \nfor safety at rail level crossings, and is al so recommending that\
  \ the NZ Transport Agency work \nwith licensed rail access providers and road controlling\
  \ authorities to ensure th at the safety of \nrail users  and road users  is not\
  \ compromised by the growth of vegetation around  level \ncrossings .  \n4.5.5.\
  \  The Commission is  also recommending that , in the short term, where KiwiRail\
  \ becomes aware \nof vegetation affecting the sighting distances at level crossings\
  \ for which it is the licen sed \naccess provider, it work with the relevant road\
  \ controlling authority to re move or control that \nvegetation.  \n4.5.6.  The\
  \ Commission is also recommending to Local Government New Zealand that, in the short\
  \ \nterm, where road controlling authorities become aware of vegetation affecting\
  \ the sighting \ndistances at level crossings, they work with  the relevant licensed\
  \ access provider s to remove \nor control that vegetation.  \n \n             \

  \ There was no mechanical issue with the train or any issue with the manner in which\
  \ it was \ndriven that would  likely to h ave contributed to the accident.  \n5.2.\
  \ There was no pre -existing mechanical issue found with the truck  that contributed\
  \ to the \naccident .  However, the extent to which it was damaged in the collision\
  \ meant the possibility \ncould not be excluded .  \n5.3. There was adequate compliant\
  \ signage warning road users of the rail level crossing, and it is \nvirtually certain\
  \ that the driver of the truck was aware of its presence.  \n5.4. It is very likely\
  \ that t he driver of the truck  did not stop at the compulsory stop limit  line\
  \ before \nentering  the Lambert Road public road  level crossing in front of the\
  \ train .  \n5.5. It is very likely  that the driver of the truck was not wearing\
  \ the fitted  seatbelt at the time of the \ncollision .  Although this was a safety\
  \ issue, it was not possibl e to determine whether it was a \nfactor contributing\
  \ to the fatality . \n5.6. The sighting distance for road users of the Lambert Road\
  \ level crossing did not meet the \nminimum standard as set out in the NZ Transport\
  \ Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual.  It \nwas p ossible that drivers of long\
  \ motor vehicles that did stop  at the stop sign  would not have \nhad sufficient\
  \ time to clear the level crossing if a train  were  just out of view . \n5.7. The\
  \ legislation needs to be clearer  on the allocation  of responsibility between\
  \  licensed rail \naccess providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring\
  \ the safety of rail users and road  \nusers  at public level crossings .  \n  \n\
