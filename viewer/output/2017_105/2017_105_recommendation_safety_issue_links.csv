2017_105,031/18,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take the necessary action to clarify the allocation of responsibilities between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for maintaining sighting distances at public road level crossings.,"The sighting distance for road users at the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standard as set out in the Manual. It was possible that drivers who did stop at the stop sign would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train was just out of view.

Maintaining sighting distances at level crossings is critical for the safety of road users. While most of the factors that are considered when deciding on the level of protection to give a level crossing are unlikely to change significantly over time, vegetation growth can relatively quickly render a level crossing unsafe.

The legislation is not clear on the allocation of responsibility between rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail and road users at public road level crossings.

On 13 December 2018 ","Sighting distances for road users at level crossings are one of the factors used to determine the appropriate level of protection required, yet the growth in vegetation around railway level crossings can change sighting distances in a relatively short time and render the level crossings unsafe.
