- name: Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
  explanation: Compliance with traffic control devices is a safety theme relevant to this accident because the truck did not stop at the compulsory stop sign at the level crossing. The report states, "The data showed that the truck stopped to service bins either side of the level crossing, but did not stop at the level crossing, which was protected by a compulsory stop sign" (4.2.2). This indicates that the truck driver's non-compliance with the stop sign was a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Sighting Distance at Level Crossings
  explanation: Sighting distance at level crossings is a critical safety theme as it affects the ability of a road user to detect an oncoming train in time to stop safely. In this accident, "the maximum sighting distance available to the truck driver had been reduced from 423 metres to 83 metres" due to vegetation growth, which meant that "even if the truck had stopped at the yellow limit line, the truck driver would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing safely in the event of a train approaching from just out of the driver's view" (4.4.8). This reduction in sighting distance significantly increased the risk of an accident at the level crossing.
- name: Use of Seatbelts
  explanation: The use of seatbelts is a safety theme that, while it may not have contributed to the occurrence of the accident, is relevant to the survivability of the collision. The report notes that "After the accident the seatbelt was found to be unlocked. It was therefore unlikely that the driver was wearing a seatbelt at the time of impact" (4.3.1). Although it could not be determined if wearing a seatbelt would have saved the driver, "wearing a seatbelt will generally increase the chances of a person surviving an accident" (4.3.2), highlighting the importance of seatbelt use.
- name: Driver Awareness and Expectation
  explanation: Driver awareness and expectation is a safety theme related to this accident due to the possibility that the truck driver had a low expectation of encountering a train. The report suggests that "One explanation for the driver not stopping was a low expectation of encountering a train at the level crossing" (4.2.13). With an average of eight trains each day and the possibility that the truck driver had never encountered a train at the crossing before, the driver's expectation could have influenced their decision not to stop.
- name: Vegetation Control Around Level Crossings
  explanation: Vegetation control around level crossings is a safety theme because it directly impacts the sighting distance and, consequently, the safety of the level crossing. The report identifies that "vegetation growth can relatively quickly render a level crossing unsafe" (4.4.11) and that in this case, vegetation had obscured the view, reducing the sighting distance from 423 metres to 83 metres (4.4.8). This lack of visibility was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Clarity of Responsibility for Level Crossing Safety
  explanation: Clarity of responsibility for level crossing safety is a safety theme that emerges from the report's findings. The report points out that "The legislation needs to be clearer on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail users and road users at public level crossings" (5.7). This lack of clarity can lead to inadequate maintenance or safety measures, as was the case with the vegetation control that contributed to the reduced sighting distance at the level crossing.
