- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence in the document that fatigue played a role in the accident. The toxicology results showed no impairment, and it was unlikely that the truck driver was fatigued because the work involved day shifts only, and the driver had only recently returned to work from having been on leave (4.2.11).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The Commission concluded that it was very likely that the truck did not stop before proceeding over the level crossing (4.1.3). Additionally, the Commission could only conclude that the driver did not consistently stop at the level crossing, with one explanation being a low expectation of encountering a train at the level crossing (4.2.13). This indicates a significant contribution of human error and assumptions to the accident.

- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The sighting distance for road users of the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standard, and it was possible that drivers of long motor vehicles that did stop at the stop sign would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train were just out of view (5.6). This indicates that situational awareness was compromised, contributing to the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes

  explanation: Vegetation growth on the boundary of a private property adjacent to the level crossing had grown to a height of about two meters, reducing the maximum sighting distance available to the truck driver from 423 meters to 83 meters (4.4.8).
