The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may mak e recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring  into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of  the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. Shortly before midday on Friday 6 October 2017, a Waste Management NZ Limited truck was 
servicing domestic waste bins along  the no -exit Lambert Road, near Kawerau.  There was a 
railway level crossing where the  Murupara Branch railway line crossed Lambert Road.  The 
level crossing was protected by stop signs , which required all road users to stop and look for 
trains before proceeding over the crossing.  
1.2. The truck had reached the end of Lambert Road  and turned around, and was stopping 
periodically to service bins on the other side of the road.  When the truck entered the level 
crossing it was struck by a n empty log  train that was travelling from Kawerau towards 
Murupa ra. 
1.3. The train struck the left side of the truck at a speed of about 63 kilometres per hour .  The 
truck driver was thrown clear of the truck and was fatally injured.  The truck was significantly 
damaged.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that it was very likely 
the truck did not stop and was travelling at about 48 kilometres per hour  as it entered the 
level crossing.  The re were no technical  issues found with the truck that could have 
contributed to the accident.  
1.5. The Commission found  no issues with the manner in which the train was being driven that 
could have contributed to the accident , and the level crossing was well signposted in 
accordan ce with the required rail and road standards.  
1.6. Notwithstanding the likelihood that the truck did not stop, the Commission found  that even if it 
had, the driver would not have had sufficient view lines for the truck to clear the level crossing 
from a stop if  a train had been just out of view.  
1.7. The Commission also found  that t he legislation needs to be clearer on the allocation of 
responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for 
ensuring the safety of rail  users  and road users at public  road  level crossings . 
1.8. The Commiss ion identified two safety issue s: 
 the legislation is not clear on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access 
providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of  road and rail users at 
public road level crossings  
 sighting distances for road users at level crossings are one of the factors used to 
determine the appropriate level of protection required, yet the  growth in vegetation 
around railway level crossings can change sighting distance s3 in a relative ly short time 
and render the level crossing s unsafe.  
1.9. The Commission made two recommend ations  to the Chief Execut ive of the NZ Transport 
Agency , one recommendation  to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail Holdings Limited and one 
recommendation to the Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand to address the se 
issues.  
1.10.  The key lessons  identified arising from the inquiry into this occurrence are : 
 road users must always approach railway level crossings with extreme care,  
particularly those level crossings that have passive protection only in the form of Give 
Way or Stop signage  
 wearing seatbelts will increase the chances of people surviving accident s. 
                                                        
3 The sighting distance is the minimum distance to an approaching train from the centre of a level crossing, 
when a road vehicle driver must first see an approaching train in order to clear the level crossing safely 
ahead of that train.

Tuesday 10 October to conduct a site examination .   
2.3. The Commission's investigators interviewed a New Zealand Police Serious Crash Unit 
investigator, the next  of kin of the driver of the Hino 500 series heavy motor vehicle  (the                                                                                                         
truck) , Waste Management  NZ Limited  (Waste Management) personnel , the driver of the train, 
the resident who made the  first phone call to the emergency services , and an engineer from 
the road controlling authority, Whakat āne Distr ict Council  (Council) . 
2.4. The Commission engaged an authorised crash vehicle inspector from Vehicle Testing New 
Zealand  Limited  to assist with the examination of the truck wreckage.  
2.5. The Commission obtained t he following records and documents for analysis:  
 the data downloaded from the train's event recorder  
 the train control diagram  
 the train controller's voice recordings  
 the train  driver's training records and timesheets  
 the data downloaded from the truck's  management system  
 the truck  driver's training records, safety observation reports  and results of random 
drug and alcohol test s  
 the level crossing site survey data . 
2.6. On 18 July 2018  the Commissioners considered the draft report and approved it to be sent to 
interested persons for consultation.  
2.7. Four written submissions were received.  As a result of those submissions further investigation 
work was undertaken.  
2.8. On 24 October 2018 th e Commission approved a revised draft report for consultation with 
four interested persons . 
2.9. Three written submissions were received.  The Commission considered the submissions, and 
changes as a result of those submissions have been included in the final re port.  
2.10.  On 12 December 2018  the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 Final Report RO -2017 -105 3.1.2.  The truck stopped twice to service bins before it passed over the level crossing in a 
southbound direction at about 1125.  The level crossing was where the Murupara Branch 
railway line crossed Lambert Road and was protected by 'passive' compulsory sto p signs.  The 
truck did not stop at the level crossing.  
3.1.3.  The truck continued southbound , servicing  the bins along Lambert Road .  It turned at the end 
of the road and travelled back towards the state highway , servicing bins on the other  side of 
the road . 
3.1.4.  It was daylight but t he was sky was overcast and light drizzle was falling . 
3.1.5.  The truck stopped at five more locations  to service bins , the last of which was 126 metres  
before reaching the level crossing.  The last recorded stop was  at 1131:02 . 
3.1.6.  Meanwhile a freight train, comprising a single locomotive hauling empty log wagons , had 
departed from Kawerau travelling towards Murupara and was approaching the level crossing.  
3.1.7.  At 1131:256, when the train was about 140 metres from the level crossing , the driver  
sound ed the train whistle as a standard warning to road users . 
3.1.8.  The first time the train driver saw the truck was when it appeared close in front of the train 
travelling from right to left .  The train was travelling at about 63 kilometres per hour when it 
struck the left -hand door of the truck  at 1131:33 , rotating it nearly 270 degrees and rolli ng it 
onto its left -hand side (see Figure 2).   The truck  driver  was ejected from the driving position  
and was fatal ly injured.   
3.1.9.  The front of the train was 323 metre s past the level crossing  when it stopped.   The locomotive 
and the wagons stayed on the track.

 3.2. Road  and level crossing i nformation  
3.2.1.  Lambert Road was a sealed , two-way, no-exit public road providing access to 16 properties.  
The road was 1,329 metres long7, running in a southerly  direction  from the state highway .  
The northbound approach to the level crossing8 was straight for  about 900 metres .  The road 
was 5.5 metres wide at the level crossing .  A December 2013 road survey carried out by the 
Council reported 36 vehicles per day passing over the level crossing.  
3.2.2.  Lambert Road ha d no posted speed limits.  The Council  confirmed  that the maximum 
authorised road speed was 100 kilometres per hour .   
3.2.3.  The Lambert Road level crossing  was protected with passive controls9 in accordance with t he 
NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual , Part 9, Level crossings, second edition, 
amendment 1, effective December 201210 (the Manual) .   
3.2.4.  KiwiRail Holdings Limited ( KiwiRail ) was the licensed rail access provider and was responsible 
for all signage within the rail corridor.  Signage  was located on the left -hand side of the 
crossing  in the direction the truck was travell ing at the time.  It was the standard pole-
mounted STOP  assembly consisting of a crossbuck 'RAILWAY CROSSING'  mounted above a 
'STOP' sign, and the optional 'LOOK FOR TRAINS' sign (see Figure 3).  The signage was in good 
condition.

 3.2.7.  The Manual require d the Council to install and maintain the road markings.   When 
approaching the level crossing northbound , the word 'RAIL ' and the letter ' X' were painted on 
the road before and after the  railway level crossing warning sign (see Figure 5).  The road 
markings at the level crossing  included a yellow limit line, a centreline and the word STOP  (see 
Figure 6 ). 
3.2.8.  The yellow line was 4.3 metres from the nearest  rail when measured along the road  
centreline.  The Manual require d the limit line to be not less than 2.4 metres from the nearest 
rail. 
3.2.9.  Records provided by the Council showed that there had been a non -injury accident in 2010.  A 
car had stopped too close to the rail tracks and had been  clipped by a passing train.

3.3.2.  The truck was subjected to a regular maintenance regime.  An 'A' maintenance  service was 
required  every 150 hours or 5,000 kilometres and a 'B' maintenance  service every 300 hours 
or 10,000 kilometres.  A comprehensive brake check was carried out during the  'B' service  
because of the frequent stop/start activity that the truck  perform ed.  The maintenance 
service s were  contracted out  to a third party . 
3.3.3.  The most recent  'A' service had been  carried out on 19 August 2017 with 28 ,823 kilometres  
recorded on the odometer .  The most recent  'B' maintenance  service had been  carried out on 
16 September  2017 , 20 days before the accident .  The truck  had travelled 2 ,733 kilometres 
between service checks and accumulated  190 engine running hours.  There was nothing of 
significance recorded on the  most recent  'B' maintenance service sheet.  
3.3.4.  A post -accident examination was conducted of the truck11.  The examination confirmed  that 
the dual control was in the left -hand -drive position.  There was no evidence of pre -existing 
mechanical faults on the truck . 
3.4. Rail operating information    
3.4.1.  The movement s of rail vehicles and track access on the 58-kilometre -long Murupara Branch 
line were  managed  from the National Train Control Centre in Wellington  using a  track warrant 
control  operating system .  A train could  not enter any part of the main line without the driver 
holding  the authority of a track warrant .  In this case t he train driver held a valid track warrant 
to occupy the section of track  that crossed the Lambert Road level crossing . 
3.4.2.  The train operating schedule allow ed for 12 planned freight train movements per day on  the 
Murupara Branch line : six return movements between Kawerau and Murupara.  The trains 
convey ed empty log wagons from Kawerau  and return ed loaded with logs .  The number of 
daily train movements varie d depending on commercial requirements.  On average  there were  
eight train movements per day .  The trains did not operate to a strict timetable.  
                                                        
11 The Commission engaged an authorised crash vehicle inspector from Vehicle Testing New Zealand to 
assist with conducting the examination.

 3.4.3.  Freight trains operating on the Murupara Branch line were restricted to a maximum authorised 
line speed of 65 kilometres per hour.   
3.5. Personnel  
The driver of the train  
3.5.1.  The Kawerau -based train driver's certification was current.  The train driver  had 43 years ' 
driving experience  and had worked out of the Kawerau depot for the previous  39 years . 
3.5.2.  The driver had worked three shifts from 0315 to 1035 on consecutive days starting on 
Saturday 30 September  and finishing on  Monday 2 October.  The driver  had been  rostered off 
duty on Tuesday 3 October and Wednesday 4 October  and was on annual leave on T hursday 5 
October.  The train driver  started work at 0705 on Friday 6 October  2017.  At the time of the 
accident the train driver  was on their  second and final return trip between Kawerau and 
Murupara.  
3.5.3.  The train driver was not asked to submit to post -incident drug and alcohol testing.  Clause 
3.2.2 of KiwiRail's Drug and Alcohol Policy  stated in part:   
Employees will not be tested after  
level crossing and  trespass fatalities.   
3.5.4.  KiwiRail advised that the train driver was not tested because of the right -of-way provisions 
contained in section  80 of the Railways Act 2005 , which  stated in part:  
80 Rail vehicles have right of way  
(a) the train driver  is entitled to assume, for the purposes of 
determining at which it is reasonable for [ their ] rail vehicle to 
travel past a level crossing…  that all person s, animals, and 
vehicles not  using  the railway line will keep clear of the railway 
line.   
The driver  of the truck  
3.5.5.  The driver  of the truck had been employed by Waste Management , Whakat āne, since 2012.  
3.5.6.  The truck driver  held a current driver licence with endorsement for classes 1F, 2F and 4F, 
appropriate for the truck  being  driven.  The class 4 endorsement allowed a driver  to operate a 
rigid vehicle with a gross laden weight in excess of 18,000 kilograms.  The vehicle had a gross 
mass of 22,000 kilograms.  
3.5.7.  The driver of the  truck  was familiar with the route , having last driven it on Friday 22 
September  2017.  The driver  had been  on annual leave from Wednesday 26 September  until 
Tuesday 3 October inclusive, followed by one day of sick leave before returning  to work at 
0700 on  Thursday 5 October  2017.  The driver's  logbook showed the work period  finished at 
1730  that day.   
3.5.8.  The truck driver did not make an entry in the logbook on 6 October 2017.  The vehicle trip 
recorder showed  that the truck exited the depot at 0710 :59.  
3.5.9.  There was no activity on the truck driver's mobile phone at the time of the collision.  
Toxicological samples were obtained and tested .  There was no evidence of alcohol or 
performance -impairing substances in the driver's  system.   
3.5.10.  Waste Management had a policy of conduct ing random drug and alcohol test s of at least 10% 
of its staff every month.  The truck  driver  had been tested nine times  while employed by  Waste 
Management  and had  always returned a zero reading for alcohol and negative results for 
performa nce-impairing substances . 
 

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -105 3.5.11.  The driver had undergone t hree in -cab driving assessments  while working for Waste 
Management .  On 13 January 2015  the assessor  had identified two critical errors, one of 
which related to not stopping at a compulsory stop sign.  The assessor had stated in part:  
… (did not come to a complete stop) at comp ulsory stop sign when turning left 
from McGarvey Road onto Peace Road.  
3.5.12.  The most recent driver assessment had been  carried out on 26 October 2016 .  No critical 
operational or driving errors had been  identified  and t he assessor 's comments had been  
positive .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The data from the train's event recorder confirmed that the train driver had the tr ain 
complying with all applicable rail system requirements as it approached the level crossing , 
including the authorised line speed . 
4.1.2.  An examination of the truck following the accident did not identify any pre-existing mechanical 
fault that could have contributed to the accident.  However, the extent of the damage to the 
truck  meant that the possibility could not be excluded.  
4.1.3.  The Commission concluded that it was very likely  that the truck did not stop before proceeding 
over the level crossing.  However, even if it had done so, there would have been  an insufficient 
sighting distance  available to the driver to clear the level crossing had the train been just out 
of view.  This conclusion and safety issue are discussed in mo re detail in the following 
analysis.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  Data  downloaded from the truck 's global positioning system  (GPS) -based road -user-charge 
system (e -ruc)12 showed that the truck  entered Lambert Road from the s tate highway at 
1123:44  and travelled southbound, stopping periodically to service waste bins . 
4.2.2.  Figure 8 shows  the locations at which the truck 's speed dropped to less  than four kilometres 
per hour (recorded as the truck having stopped).  Each of these stoppages corresponded to a n 
address where a waste bin had been positioned on the roadside.  The data show ed that the 
truck stopped to service bins either side of the level crossing, but did not stop at the level 
crossing, which was protected by a compulsory stop sign . 
4.2.3.  The truck con tinued south to the end of Lambert Road, turned around and proceeded 
northbound, stopping to service bins positioned on the other side of the road.   The last 
recorded stop was made at 1131:02, when the truck  was 126 metres from the level crossing.  
                                                        
12 A management tool that records  the times and locations of vehicle events. such as when a vehicle's 
ignition is turned on and off, the vehicle enters and/or exits a geo -fenced site, the vehicle turns or the vehicle 
is stopped, and the vehicle's speed and GPS location, at predetermined t ime intervals.  The system 
determines that the vehicle has stopped when its speed falls to less than four kilometres per hour.

 4.2.4.  The train and the truck  collided  at 1131:33 according to the train event recorder, about  
31 seconds after the truck had last stopped14.  The post -accident examination of the truck 
instrument panel identified that the speedometer had 'captured' the speed  at about  
48 kilometres per hour and the tachometer  similarly 'captured'  the revs at 1,700 revolutions 
per minute  (see Figure 9).  The speed and rev counter readings were  likely to have been the 
readings when power was lost to the instrument panel as a result of the collision.  Therefore, 
the truck was likely to have been travelling at close to 48 kilometres per hour  at the time of 
impact.  
 
Figure 9

(photograph courtesy of New Zealand Police)  
4.2.5.  The data downloaded from the train's event recorder showed that it was travelling at about  
63 kilometres  per hour when the train driver sounded the locomotive whistle at 1 131:25, 
warning road users of the train's  approach.  The train was about 141 metres from the level 
crossing when the driver activated the whistle.  
4.2.6.  The driver of the train said that the truck was first seen when it was just about to enter the 
level crossing directly in front of the train .  There was  no time to drop down into the 'safe 
position' between the brake pedestal and the rear wall of the locomotive cab15 or to take any 
other preven tive action . 
4.2.7.  Similarly, there was no evidence in the form of skid marks to suggest  that the truck driver 
became aware of the train in time to take preventive action . 
4.2.8.  It was very unlikely that the truck stopped before entering the level crossing  because of  the 
following factors : 
 the speed at which the truck appeared in front of the train driver  
 the truck speed and engine revs captured on the truck's instrument panel  
                                                        
14 It was not possible to validate with absolute accuracy the times obta ined from the train event recorder 
against those obtained from the truck e -ruc system.

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -105  the fact that , shortly beforehand, the truck had not stop ped before entering the 
same level crossing when travelling southbound on Lambert Road . 
4.2.9.  It was virtually certain that the truck driver was aware of the level crossing.  The various 
warning signposts and paint markings on the road were in good condition and in accordance 
with the railway and  road authority standards.  Also, the truck  driver had worked Lambert 
Road many time s before , so would have been well aware of the level crossing's presence . 
4.2.10.  The Commission considered other possible reasons for the truck driver not stop ping at the 
level cr ossing . 
4.2.11.  The toxicology results showed that there  was no impair ment .  It was unlikely that the truck 
driver was  fatigued because  the work involved  day shifts only , and the driver had only recently 
returned to work from having been on leave.  The driver was frequently starting and stopping 
the truck with the high degree of precision required to service the waste bins.  Th is suggested 
that the driver was  alert at the time and unlikely to have fallen asleep.  
4.2.12.  Mobile phones are known to be common source s of distraction.  However, the driver's phone 
was recovered and the phone records established that the phone  was not being used at the 
time of the accident . 
4.2.13.  The Commission could only conclude that the driver did not consistently stop at the level 
crossing .  One explanation for the driver not stopping  was a low expectation of encountering a 
train at the level crossing .   
4.2.14.  With an average eight  trains each day, the frequency of trains travelling through the level 
crossing was not high.  At the time of day that  the driver would normally have been working 
Lambert Road, the KiwiRail master train control plan had two trains passing through the area, 
with a possible 55 minutes between trains.  It is not known if the truck driver had ever 
previously  encountered a tra in at the level crossing  while working along Lambert Road or was 
aware of the train running times.  
4.2.15.  Freight  trains do not run to strict schedule s and road users must expect train s at any time.  On 
the day of the accident , train services on the Murupara Bra nch line were running about 30 
minutes ahead of the train control plan.  
4.3. Survivability  
4.3.1.  The dual -control truck was being operated from the left -hand seat at th e time of the collision , 
which was where the train first hit the truck .  Waste Management's Safe Driving Policy  
required seatbelts to be worn at all times .  After the accident the seatbelt was found to be 
unlocked .  It was therefore unlikely that the driver was wearing a seatbelt at the time of 
impact .   
4.3.2.  It could not be determined whether the driver w ould have survived had  a seatbelt  been worn .  
Nevertheless, wearing a seatbelt will generally increase the chances of  a person  surviving an 
accident , which is a lesson arising from this inquiry.  
4.4. Sighting distance at the level crossing  
Safety issue - Sighting distances  for road users at level crossings are one of the factors used 
to determine the appropriate level of protection required, yet  the growth  in vegetation around 
railway level crossings can change sighting distance s in a relative ly short time and render the 
level crossing s unsafe . 
4.4.1.  Level crossings are different from  roads in that the overall risk profile is skewed towards a low -
probability but high -consequence event.  As such, level crossings are protected through the 
use of appropri ate traffic control devices.  The devices installed are dependent on a range of 
factors including:  
 
 
Final Report RO -2017 -105 
<< Page 15 >>
  the level crossing type  
 the volume and speed of rail and road traffic  
 the mix of road and rail traffic using the level crossing  
 the alignment of the road ap proach to the level crossing  
 other physical attributes of the level crossing and its surrounds . 
4.4.2.  There are  1,388 public road level crossings on the national rail network .  Of those public road 
level crossings , 715 (52%) have active protection .  There are 41 9 crossings protected by 
flashing lights and bells and 296 have half -arm barriers and flashing lights and bells.  The 
other 673 public road  level crossings are all protected with passive signs, either 'Give Way' or 
'Stop'  signs .  The Lambert Road public road level crossing is one of 393 protected with 'Stop' 
signage.   
4.4.3.  The Australian Level Crossing Assessment Model (ALCAM) is an assessment tool adopted by 
New Zealand that is  used to identify key potential risks at all level crossings and to assist in 
the prioritisation of level crossings for upgrade.  The ALCAM process involves collecting data 
by way of level crossing site surveys , and collecting both train and road data  from the 
respective rail and road authorities.  The ALCAM assessment  output data showe d that the 
Lambert Road public road level crossing presented a relatively low risk ; it rated 965 out of 
1,388 public road level crossings on the rail network . 
4.4.4.  Passive controls are generally used where there are low volumes of both road and rail traffic , 
which make the likelihood of a collision low.  The Lambert Road public road level crossing met 
the requirement for passive controls, having  six to eight daily rail movements and an average 
of 36 vehicle movements passing over the level crossing each day.  St op sign s are used at 
those level crossings  where the road user has insufficient time to sight an approaching train 
and stop before reachin g the level crossing limit line.  
4.4.5.  The most recent ALCAM site survey at the Lambert Road level crossing had been carried  out 
on 18 June 2011.  The survey had reviewed the road traffic control measure s in place and 
recorded various parameters that included  the: 
 width of the road  
 maximum distance between the limit line and the closest rail  
 angle between the roadway and the railway track  
 road approach gradient  
 maximum sighting distance available from the road user's eye position , taken from 
one and a half metres behind the limit line.   
4.4.6.  The survey data was then used to calculate the minimum sighting distance that a road user 
require d to clear the level crossing safely ahead of an approaching train.  The measured and 
calculated sighting distances were compared to determine what , if any , corrective action was 
required.  Appendix 1 sets out the procedure for calculating sigh ting distances at level 
crossings.  
4.4.7.  For the northbound approach to the level crossing , the calculated minimum re -start sighting 
distance required for a truck of the type involved in this accident was 183 metres.  That 
distance compared favourably with the 4 23 metre s of available sighting distance recorded at 
the time of the ALCAM survey.   
4.4.8.  During the seven years since th e ALCAM survey , vegetation on the boundary of a private 
property adjacent to  the level crossing had grown to a height of about two metres .  As a result , 
the maximum sighting distance available to the truck  driver had been reduced from  
423 metres to 83 metres (see Figure 10).  This meant that even if the truck had  stopped at 
the yellow limit line, the truck  driver would not have had sufficient  time to clear the level 
crossing  safely  in the event of a train approaching from just out of the driver 's view .

 Final Report RO -2017 -105 4.4.9.  Furthermore, even if the  driver had tried to look for trains as the truck approached the level 
crossing , the train would have been obscured by a high hedge that ran parallel to the road.

improve the sighting distance (see Figure 11).

 4.4.11.  Maintaining sighting distances at level crossings is critical for the safety of road users.  While 
most of the factors that are considered when deciding on the  level of protection to give a level 
crossing are unlikely  to change significantly  over time, vege tation growth can relatively quickly 
render a level crossing unsafe.  
4.5. Responsibility  for maintaining sighting distance s at public road level crossings  
Safety issue -The legislation is not clear on the allocation  of responsibility between  licensed 
rail acces s providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of road and rail 
users at public road level crossings.   
4.5.1.  As the main rail access provider, KiwiRail maintained a program me for controlling vegetation 
around the public road level crossings within its rail corridor .  However, the mechanisms for 
controlling road traffic at level crossings are diverse.  In this example , one or more of the 
following mechanisms could have been used to ensure the safety of road vehicles and rail 
vehicles at the Lambert Road  level crossing:  
 remove the vegetation to improve the sighting distance  at the level crossing  
 improve the view lines  for vehicles approaching the level crossing so that a 'Give Way' 
sign could be used instead of a 'Stop ' sign 
 reduce the speed of trains over the level crossing to allow long vehicles stopped at the 
level crossing sufficient time to cross safely  
 install active level crossing protection.  
4.5.2.  Level crossings are the intersection of two jurisdictions : the rail access pro vider and the road 
controlling authority.  Relevant legislation16 is not clear about what entity or entities have 
ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety of both rail users  and road users  at public road 
level crossings.  
4.5.3.  The Commission has raised a s imilar issue in it s watchlist item 'Safety for pedestrians and 
vehicles using level crossings', which highlight s that the safety of pedestrians and vehicles 
using level crossings has been compromised because of ambiguities in the responsibilities of 
road a nd rail authorities.  
4.5.4.  The Commission is recommending that , in the long term, the NZ Transport Agency take action 
to clarify the responsibilities of licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities 
for safety at rail level crossings, and is al so recommending that the NZ Transport Agency work 
with licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities to ensure th at the safety of 
rail users  and road users  is not compromised by the growth of vegetation around  level 
crossings .  
4.5.5.  The Commission is  also recommending that , in the short term, where KiwiRail becomes aware 
of vegetation affecting the sighting distances at level crossings for which it is the licen sed 
access provider, it work with the relevant road controlling authority to re move or control that 
vegetation.  
4.5.6.  The Commission is also recommending to Local Government New Zealand that, in the short 
term, where road controlling authorities become aware of vegetation affecting the sighting 
distances at level crossings, they work with  the relevant licensed access provider s to remove 
or control that vegetation.

 Final Report RO -2017 -105 5. Findings  
5.1. There was no mechanical issue with the train or any issue with the manner in which it was 
driven that would  likely to h ave contributed to the accident.  
5.2. There was no pre -existing mechanical issue found with the truck  that contributed to the 
accident .  However, the extent to which it was damaged in the collision meant the possibility 
could not be excluded .  
5.3. There was adequate compliant signage warning road users of the rail level crossing, and it is 
virtually certain that the driver of the truck was aware of its presence.  
5.4. It is very likely that t he driver of the truck  did not stop at the compulsory stop limit  line before 
entering  the Lambert Road public road  level crossing in front of the train .  
5.5. It is very likely  that the driver of the truck was not wearing the fitted  seatbelt at the time of the 
collision .  Although this was a safety issue, it was not possibl e to determine whether it was a 
factor contributing to the fatality . 
5.6. The sighting distance for road users of the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the 
minimum standard as set out in the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual.  It 
was p ossible that drivers of long motor vehicles that did stop  at the stop sign  would not have 
had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train  were  just out of view . 
5.7. The legislation needs to be clearer  on the allocation  of responsibility between  licensed rail 
access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail users and road  
users  at public level crossings .

 Final Report RO -2017 -105 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. KiwiRail worked with the adjacent land owner to improve the sighting distance at the  Lambert 
Road public  road  level crossing.  
Safety actions taken to address other safety issues  
7.3. Whakatāne District Council surveyed all its level crossings for compliance with signage and 
sighting distance standards  and found no issues to address .

 8. Recommendation s 
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendation s have been issued to the  NZ Transport Agency  to 
address the long -term solution and to the major rail access provider, KiwiRail , to address the 
short -term solution . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety , it is important that these recommenda tions are  
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation s made to the NZ Transport Agency  
8.3. The sighting distance for road users at the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the 
minimum sta ndard as set out in the Manual .  It was possible that drivers who did stop at the 
stop sign would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train was just out of 
view.  
Maintaining sighting distances at level crossings is critical for th e safety of road users.  While 
most of the factors that are considered when deciding on the  level of protection to give a level 
crossing are unlikely  to change significantly over time, vegetation growth can relatively quickly 
render a level crossing unsafe.  
The legislation is not clear on the allocation  of responsibility between  rail access providers and 
road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail  and road users at public road level 
crossings . 
On 13 December 2018  the Commission recommended that the Chief E xecutive of the NZ 
Transport Agency take the necessary act ion to clarify the allocation of responsibilities between  
licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for maintaining  sighting 
distances at public road level crossings .  (031/18)  
On 13 December 2018 the Commission recommended that the C hief Execu tive of the NZ 
Transport Agency work with licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities to 
ensure that they meet their responsibilities for maintain ing sighting distances at public road 
level crossings . (032/18)  
On 17 January 2019 , the Chief Executive of New Zealand Transport Agency replied , in part : 
The NZ Transport Agency has accepted these recommendations. In order to comply 
with these recommendations  and enhance its regulatory oversight of the industry the 
Transport  Agency is currently recruiting more personnel  into the rail regulatory space.  
The full -time positions will not be entirely dedicated to level crossing safety, but they 
are expected to help provide a system approach to evaluating the critical risk and 
system assur ances across the country.  The work will be complementary to the 
current ALCAM assessments (which deal with the assessments of level crossing 
safety on an individual basis) and other level crossing work in progress.  It is not 
intended to deter from the ef forts of those processes.  
The Transport Agency (Rail Regulator) intends to apply a holistic approach to the 
road rail interface.  The complexities of relationships between local authorities and 
the rail access providers in managing level crossing is to be more centralised in 
order to maintain a consistent approach to construction, regulation and safety.  
While significant progress has been made it is accepted that as the rail industry 
grows, particularly in the suburban areas, the management of level crossin g 
construction and protection will require greater scrutiny, primarily for the reasons of 
 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -105 increased train frequencies and the number of incidents of damage to rail protection 
systems.  
Recommendation made to KiwiRail  
8.4. Until the responsibilities for the main tenance of sighting distances at public road level 
crossings have been clarified, it is important for the safety of rail users and road users that 
there are effective  program mes to control  vegetation growth aroun d public road  level 
crossings .  
On 13 Decemb er 2018  the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail  that, 
until the NZ  Transport Agency has clarified the responsibilities for maintaining sighting 
distances at public road level crossings, where KiwiRail becomes aware of vegetation 
affec ting the sighting distances at level crossings for which it is the licensed access provider, it 
work with the relevant road controlling authority to remove or control the vegetation. (033/18)  
On 18 December 2018 , the Acting Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied:  
KiwiRail accepts the recommendation as presented and will ensure that, where it is 
brought to KiwiRail's attention that vegetation is affecting sighting distances at 
particular public read level crossings for which it is access provider, it works with the 
relevant road controlling authorities to manage that vegetation.  
KiwiRail  will also liaise with the NZ Transport Agency as required in order for the
