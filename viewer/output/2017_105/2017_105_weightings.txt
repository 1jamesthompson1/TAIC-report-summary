The toxicology results showed no impairment, and it was unlikely that the truck driver was fatigued because the work involved day shifts only, and the driver had only recently returned to work from having been on leave (4.2.11).
","0.0","26.667","The Commission concluded that it was very likely that the truck did not stop before proceeding over the level crossing (4.1.3). Additionally, the Commission could only conclude that the driver did not consistently stop at the level crossing, with one explanation being a low expectation of encountering a train at the level crossing (4.2.13). This indicates a significant contribution of human error and assumptions to the accident.
","5.774","0.0","There is no information provided in the document that suggests a lack of training or competency contributed to the accident. The truck driver was familiar with the route and had worked Lambert Road many times before (4.2.9).

","0.0","20.0","The sighting distance for road users of the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standard, and it was possible that drivers of long motor vehicles that did stop at the stop sign would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train were just out of view (5.6). This indicates that situational awareness was compromised, contributing to the accident.
