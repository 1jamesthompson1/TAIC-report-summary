Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Potential sources of ignition: The report discusses several potential sources of ignition for the fire, including the electric motor, laptop battery, and fluorescent lights. However, none of these sources could be conclusively determined as the cause of the fire.
2. Crew response: The crew responded quickly and effectively to the fire, following standard procedures outlined in the Safe Ship Management Manual. Their actions were commended for their decisive command and control of the situation.
3. Fire detection and containment: The report highlights the lack of fire detectors inside the fishmeal bagging room, which delayed the detection of the fire.
