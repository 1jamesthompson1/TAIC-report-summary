The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an  independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or d etermine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced ag ainst its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. In the early hours of 12 September 2012, the fishing factory trawler Ama ltal Columbia  was 
fishing off the Canterbury coast when fire broke out in the fishmeal bagging room on the fish 
processing deck.  
1.2. The master made a Mayday call, and two nearby fishing vessels were requested to stand  by 
the Amaltal Columbia  to assist.  
1.3. Despite the fire -fighting efforts of the crew, it was necessary for them to abandon ship.  The 
entire crew were transferred to the assisting vessels, one of which took the Amaltal Columbia  
under tow to the port of Lyttelton.  
1.4. The New Zealand Fire Service met the vessel on arr ival and subsequently declared the fire 
‘out’.  Nobody was seriously injured but the vessel was extensively damaged.  
1.5. The Commission found  that the fire was seated amongst bales of polypropylene bags that 
were stored in the fishmeal bagging room, but was unable to establish with any certainty what 
started the fire.  
1.6. The Commission also found  that the Amaltal Columbia ’s design and systems for the 
prevention, detection, containment and fighting of a fire met the standards of the applicable 
maritime rules; howev er, there were some aspects that could have been improved , and the 
consequences of the fire could have been lessened , with a more risk -based approach to 
operations.  
1.7. Key lessons  arising from this accident included:  
 the e arly detection of fires is critical to preventing their taking hold and spreading  
 older-style fluorescent light fittings are more prone to failure and likely to start a fire than 
more modern fittings.  Operators of older ships should consider the risk of not re placing 
such lights with more modern and safer lights  
 arrangements that are designed to close off a space and contain a fire need to be quick, 
easy and intuitive to use, taking account of the conditions the crew are likely to encounter 
in a real fire  
 the use of fire -retardant materials in the construction and fit -out of spaces on board ships 
will help to prevent the ignition and spreading of fires.

 Final report MO -2012 -203 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At about 0700 on 12 September 2012 the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) was notified by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand that a fire had 
occurred on  board the fishing vessel Amaltal Columbia  approximately 85 kilometres north -east of 
Lyttelton.  
2.2. The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the  Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator  in charge . 
2.3. On 13 September 2012 two investigators travelled to Lyttelton to conduct a site investigation  on 
board the vessel , collect evidence and conduct interviews of the  crew.  
2.4. The investigation  of the s cene  of the fire was conducted jointly by  representatives from the 
Commission, the New Zealand Fire Service and the vessel’s insurance company . The Commission 
referenced the Fire Service investigation report while  prepar ing this report. Fire-damaged electronic 
items were uplifted and subsequently examined by the New Zealand Police E -Crime  Laboratory  as 
potential source s of the fire.  
2.5. On 20 September two investigators travelled to Nelson to conduct further interviews of some of the 
Amaltal Columbia ’s crew and members of the Amaltal Columbia ’s shore management.  
2.6. The Maritime Operations Centre keep s a 24 -hour watch on all the stations in the radio network. 
The operators respond to distress calls, handle  trip reports and broadcast safety information.  The 
Maritime Operations Centre ’s log of events was obtained and used to collate a timeline of events.  
2.7. On 2 November 2016  the Commission approved the draft final report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment. Four submissions were received  and any changes resulting from those 
submissions have been reflected in this final report . 
2.8. On 22 February 2017 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  The Amaltal Columbia  is a deep -sea factory trawler2 built in 1991.  It was purchased new and 
operated by Talley’s Group Limited  from its home port of Nelson.  
3.1.2.  In the early morning of 19 August 2012 the Amaltal Columbia  departed from Nelson to fish 
waters to the  east of New Zealand.   Fishing commenced on the night of 19 August.  Fishing 
continued for the next three  weeks without incident.  
3.1.3.  At about 0 230 on 12 September , the crew shot  the net3 and began trawling.  The swell was 
about four metres  and the wind strength about 45 knots  (about 83 kilometres per hour) . 
3.1.4.  The Amaltal Columbia  was equipped with a fishmeal plant , which  render ed fish processing 
waste into dry fishmeal powder.  Fishmeal is a by -product of fish processing.  The waste (fish 
heads etc) from t he fish processing factory is dried and ground into powder.  
3.1.5.  The actual rendering machine was located aft of and below the fish processing factory  (see 
Figures 1).  The dried fishmeal was  fan-blown in powder form through ducting  from the 
rendering machine t o the bagging room, which was  a purpose -built room on the same level as 
and forward of the fish processing factory , sectioned off by a steel -framed plywood bulkhead . 
3.1.6.  The fishmeal plant and the fishmeal bagging room were operated by one crew  member ( the 
fishmeal plant operator).  The fishmeal plant operator  was working in a different part of the 
vessel when a t about 0445 he went to prepare and start the fishmeal plant (shown in Figure 
1).  Starting the fishmeal plant also started the transfer fan in th e bagging room.  He had not 
been  to the bagging room  before  the time the fire was discovered.  
3.1.7.  At about 0500 the second mate was making his way forward through the factory deck  (see 
Figure 1) .  Workers on the fish processing packing line told him they could  smell  smoke.   He 
continued  forward and noticed smoke coming out of the open door of the fishmeal bagging 
room .  The smoke increased in intensity as he got closer.  
3.1.8.  The second mate immediately r eturned  to the fish processing packing line and notified  the 
crew working there  that there was a fire in the fishmeal  bagging room .  There was a fire hose 
located close to the fishmeal baggin g room door .  Two of the crew connected  the hose to a 
hydrant , charged  it and began to fight the fire .  
3.1.9.  The second mate notified the watchkeeper on the bridge of the fire.   The watchkeeper had 
already  been alerted to the fire by the automatic fire detection alarm panel on the bridge , 
which had  activated the vessel ’s fire alarm system .  By the time the second mate had finish ed 
talking to the watchkeeper on the bridge , the thick , black smoke  billowing out of the bagging 
room door had filled the room  down to knee level.  
3.1.10.  The two crew  attempt ed to fight the fire while the second mate withdrew a nd proceeded to the 
emergency muster station on the deck aft of the bridge. 
                                                        
2 A factory trawler is a fishing vessel that has an on -board fish processing plant.  
3 Deploying the trawl net from the vessel to begin trawling is known as ‘shooting’ the net.

 3.1.11.  The master proceeded to the bridge.  Once on the bridge the master realised that a SCBA 
(self-contained breathing apparatus4) team would be required to fight the fire .  A two-man 
SCBA team was identified and briefed by the master .  They prepar ed to fight the fire  with two 
handheld carbon dioxide ( CO2) extinguishers .  A hose party w as deployed to boundary -cool the 
area surrounding the fire . 
3.1.12.  The chief engineer and two other  crew members man ned the engine room .  The remainder  of 
the crew muster ed at the  emergency muster station behind  the wheelhouse.   
3.1.13.  At about 0519, s hortly after the master had arrived on the bridge , he transmitted a Pan-Pan5 
urgency message on the very -high-frequency radio, channel 16 .  The Pan -Pan message  was 
acknowledged by Kaikoura R adio6.  About five minutes later  the fire was growing more 
intense , so the master transmitted a Mayday7 signal .  The Mayday  signal was acknowledged 
by Kaikoura Radio, which  broadcast a Mayday  relay .  The crew began preparations to abandon 
ship.   
3.1.14.  At about 0610 two other fishing vessels i n the area , the San Discovery  and the Ivan Goublets , 
were requested by the Maritime Operations Centre  to assist the Amaltal Columbia .  
3.1.15.  Meanwhile, t he SCBA team returned to the wheelhouse after they had  discharged  the two CO 2 
fire extinguishers into the fishmeal  bagging room.  Visibility was very poor on the factory deck 
due to the thick smoke.   They attempted to contain the fire by closing the fishmeal bagging 
room door, but were unable to close it fully. 
3.1.16.  They collected another two fire extinguishers , one CO 2 and one dry powder , returned to the 
factory deck  and discharged both extinguishers into the fishmeal  bagging room.  They then 
withdrew from the factory deck , exchanged their SCBA  air tanks and returned to fight the fire 
with a fire hose.  
3.1.17.  Fire-fighting ceased when the SCBA  team had used all but one of the air tanks.   The 
firefighters joined the  rest of  crew at the muster station  and prepared to  abandon ship . 
3.1.18.  By 0800  the fire had damaged propulsion and steering control system lines between the 
wheelh ouse and the engine  room.   As a result  the Amaltal Columbia ’s speed reduced and it 
would not respond to the helm .  The vessel  had lost the ability to manoeuvre .  
3.1.19.  Although  it appeared that the fire had died down and the smoke was significantly less,  the 
master ordered the crew to abandon ship . The rescue boat was launched and shortly 
after wards  the fir st of three life rafts was towed by the rescue boat  towards the Ivan Goublets . 
All the crew were transferred from the Amaltal Columbia  except for the master and chief 
engineer.  
3.1.20.  At about 1013 the master and chief engineer transferred  to the San Discovery , where they 
planned further emergency response and vessel recovery operations.  
3.1.21.  Once all the crew were safe , and all arrangement s were in place  to take the vessel under tow,  
the mayday  was cancelled at 1035.  The fire had not been  confirmed  as extinguished at that 
time.  The master and four crew subsequently returned to the Amaltal Columbia  to begin 
preparations for taking the vessel under to w. 
3.1.22.  The Amaltal Columbia  was taken under tow during the afternoon of 12 September  2012 , and 
berthed  at Lyttelton  Port at about 0100  on 13 September  2012 . 
                                                        
4 A self-contained breathing apparatus  is a breathing device worn by firefighters that provides breathable air 
in an atmosphere dangerous to health . 
5 The radio tele phone urgency signal ‘Pan -Pan’ is used to indicate that a vessel has a very urgent message to 
transmit about its safety (for example, fire on board).  
6 Kaikoura Radio is operated by the Maritime Operations Centre.  
7 The radio telephone urgency signal ‘Mayd ay’ is used to indicate that a vessel faces a grave and imminent 
threat and requires immediate assistance.  

<< Page 6 >>
 Final report MO -2012 -203 3.1.23.  The Fire Service attended the vessel on its arrival at Lyttelton  Port and at about 1200 on 14 
September determined that the fire had been extinguished.   
3.2. Firefighting  and fire -detection  appliances aboard  the Amaltal Columbia  
3.2.1.  The Amaltal Columbia  had an automatic fire detec tion and fire alarm system.  On the factory 
deck there were  one smoke detector and two manual call points in the vicinity of the fish 
processing plant.  There were another six smoke detectors located in other compartments on 
the factory deck.   There was no fire detector inside  the fis hmeal bagging room, although there 
was one outside adjacent to  the door . 
3.2.2.  Portable extinguishers were positioned at various location s throughout the vessel and 
included ABE  dry powder8, CO 2 and water. There w ere also fire hydrants and hoses positioned 
at va rious locations throughout the vessel.   A fixed Halon firefighting system was installed in 
the engine room and ammonia room, and a CO 2 flood system was installed in the auxiliary 
engine room.   There wa s no fixed firefighting system on the fish processing d eck or in the 
bagging room.  
3.2.3.  There were six SCBA  sets on board and nine spare 1,800-litre SCBA  cylinders .  Two complete 
sets of firefighting  clothing were available for the SCBA  team to use.  
3.2.4.  The firefighting appliances on  board were in -date and had been serviced and tested regularly 
by an independent organisation.  The appliances used  to fight the fire functioned correctly.   
3.3. Maritime Rule s Part 40D Design, Construction and Equipment – Fishing Ships 
3.3.1.  The Amaltal Columbia  had been  brought into the L loyd’s Register safe ship management 
system in November 1997 , at which time  it was classed as L loyd’s Register  Class +100A19.  
Although the vessel had been  built to  the Lloyd ’s Register’ s Rules and Regulations , it was also 
subject to the New Zealand Maritime Rules .  
3.3.2.  Maritime Rule s Part 40D prescribe d the requirements for the design, construction and 
equipment of New Zealand fishing ships registered under the Fisheries Acts of 1983 and 
1996.  
3.3.3.  Maritime Rule s Part 40D covered  the Amaltal Columbia ’s fire protection. The rule had come  
into force in February 2000 but the Amaltal Columbia  had been  built in 1991 .  In accordance 
with Part 40D.7 the Amaltal Columbia  had been  approved as compliant via a survey that 
found it fit for its intended service.  
3.3.4.  Classification societies10 require that vessels ’ machinery and hull s, built under their rules , be 
surveyed every five years.   It can be an onerous workload to survey all items  on a vessel  during 
a single inspection at five-yearly intervals. Another approach is to distribute  survey s of items 
over several years, such that all individual items are surveyed on a five -yearly cycle, but not 
necessarily at the same time  (called a continuous survey ).  The Amaltal Columbia  was 
subjected to a continuous survey for  both  machinery and hull.  
 
 
                                                        
8 An ABE t ype dry powder fire extinguisher is a general -purpose fire extinguisher.   
9 LR +100A1 UMS ( Unmanned Machinery Space ) means it was built un der special survey, out of steel to 
Lloyd’s Register’s Rules and Regulations, with on -board mooring and anchoring equipment. UMS means the 
control engineering equipment has been arranged and installed to allow the vessel to be operated with the 
machinery s pace unattended.  
10 A classification society establishes and maintains technical standards for the construction and operation 
of marine vessels and offshore structures.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  A fire of this magnitude on board a vessel has t he potential for loss of life, serious injury and 
significant damage to the vessel .  
4.1.2.  Ship systems and procedures must deal with the prevention, detection, contain ment and 
fighting of a fire, without the aid of external emergency services.  Early detection and action 
are paramount.   In this case the shipboard response to the fire followed standard procedures 
and was well  conducted by the crew.  
4.1.3.  The Commission has n ot been able to determine  conclusively  the cause of the fire .  However, 
several safety issues have been identified that either did hamper or could have hampered the 
detection of and response to the fire:  
 the location of fire detector sensors  
 the flammability  of some materials used on the fish processing deck  
 the design of the closures on the ventilation grilles around the fish processing deck . 
4.1.4.  The following sections discuss  the potential sources of ignition for the fire and each of these 
safety issues.  
4.2. The fi re 
4.2.1.  The seat of the fire was in the fishmeal bagging room located at the forward port side of the 
fish processing factory (shown in Figure 1). The fishmeal bagging room of the Amaltal 
Columbia ’s sister vessel is nearly identical  in layout and content .  A photograph of it is 
reproduced i n Figure 2.

4.2.3.  There were six potential sources of ignition identified ; three were discounted as causal and 
the remaining three  were inconclusive . 
Potential sources of ignition that were discounted  
4.2.4.  A fan powered by an electric motor was used to  move fishmeal from the processing plant to 
the bagging room.  It would have been  possible for the electric motor to overheat  and catch 
fire, and for burning debris to fall onto the bales of empty polypropylene fishmeal bags stored 
below .  However, the interior of the electric motor was undamaged ; the damage to the electric 
motor was  to its exterior as a result of the fire.  The Commission determined that the electric 
motor for the fishmeal fan  was not the source of ignition.  
4.2.5.  Two luggage bags  were stored on top of the bales of fishmeal bags.  One bag contained 
clothing .  The other bag contained a laptop computer.  Although the battery of the laptop  
computer  could have been  a potential source of ignition , the laptop was neither plugged in nor 
being charged .  An examination of the laptop showed that the battery and other internal  parts  
of the computer had  not failed .  The only damage it had suffered was external damage caused 
by the fire.  The Commission determined that the laptop  was not the so urce of ignition . 
4.2.6.  It is known that f ishmeal  stored in bulk can spontaneously  combust from the heat generated 
by oxidation of the fishmeal.   However, full bags of fishmeal were not stored in the bagging 
room .  The only fishmeal present in the bagging room would have been any residue within the 
bagging plant  or small amounts on the deck .  The Commission determine d that spontaneous 
combustion of fishmeal was not a source of ignition.  
Potential sources of ignition  that could not be discounted  
Fluorescent lights  (safety issue)  
4.2.7.  The bagging room was lit by fluorescent lights.  Fluorescent light fittings rely on an internal 
component called ‘ballast’, which  protect s the light s from variations in electrical voltage.  Th e 
ballast in some fluorescent light fittings manufactured before 2000 was made of pitch.  Such 
light fittings have been known to malfunction and overheat.  Overheating can cause the pitch 
to liquefy and ignite , which in turn may result in burning pitch fal ling onto whatever is below

 the light fitting11.  The Amaltal Columbia  had been  built in 1991 and the fluorescent light 
fittings installed then.   
4.2.8.  The bales of polypropylene bags used for the fishmeal were stored under the fluorescent light 
fitting.  Polypr opylene is a highly flammable material and would have provided a good source 
of fuel for the fire.  It also burns with a thick , black , acrid smoke, similar to what was observed 
on the fish processing deck in the early stages of the fire.  
4.2.9.  The ballast in flu orescent lights is known to fail for a number of reasons, including: leaving 
burned -out tubes in the fitting ; using the wrong -sized tubes ; incorrect wiring ; incorrect line 
voltage ; operation at temperatures below or above the rated limits ; power surges ; and age.  
4.2.10.  There was no conclusive evidence that the fluorescent light fitting was the source of ignition 
because the light fitting was totally consumed by the fire.  However, for the reasons given 
above the possibility could not be ruled out.  
4.2.11.  Modern  fluore scent light fittings use a different type of ballast.  H owever, there has never 
been a requirement to replace the older type  on existing ships.  
4.2.12.  Safety management systems (and more recently MOSS  [Maritime Operator Safety System] ) 
require ship owners to take  a risk -based approach to their ship operations.  The risk to any 
vessel that is still fitted with these older -style fluorescent light fittings could  be high.   Therefore 
ship owners should consider checking and/or replacing them on a voluntary basis, as th ey 
represent a safety issue for any ship where they are fitted.  
Electrical extension lead  (safety issue)  
4.2.13.  An electrical extension lead had been run from a power outlet  in the fish processing factory , 
along behind a locker and then  through a redundant pipe duct in the steel -framed wooden 
bulkhead that formed the fishmeal bagging room.  The extension lead had been permanently 
rigged to supply power to a knife sharpener inside the bagging room .  
4.2.14.  Electrical cables on ships are normally run in conduits or secured to cable tracks to prevent 
the vibration associated with operating ships at sea damaging the insulation. The extension 
lead did not comply with industry best practice.  It was not secured a long its length  and was 
free to abrade against the bulkhead or where it passed through the pipe duct.  
4.2.15.  Under Maritime Rules 40D.30 and 32, changes to the electrical system were subject to plan 
approval, class surveys and inspection.  The system was also su bject to routine planned 
maintenance. However, because of the ad -hoc nature of fitting the extension lead there was 
no record of it in the planned maintenance system.  The presence of the cable was not 
immediately obvious, so it is possible  that its condit ion had not been checked since fitting.  
4.2.16.  Using an electrical extension lead on board a vessel is not necessarily unsafe, as long as it is 
fit for purpose  and fitted to industry best practice and its condition is regularly examined as 
part of a planned maint enance routine.  
4.2.17.  Worn insulation can result in an earth -fault or short -circuiting and consequent arcing or a 
build -up of heat.  Any build -up of heat can cause ignition if a suitable source of combustible 
material is present, such as residual fishmeal or pol ypropylene  bags .  However , the most likely 
location for abrasion to insulation to occur was not in the immediate vicinity of combustible 
material , and no equipment was plugged in to the extension lead at the time .  Therefore, the 
Commission concluded , it was very unlikely that the power lead was the ignition source for the 
fire, but the possibility could not be excluded.

 Final report MO -2012 -203 The fishmeal fan unit  
4.2.18.  The fishmeal fan  was fitted with drive belts  to transfer torque from the electric motor to the 
fan.  The electr ic motor, the drive belts and the fan were enclosed within the fan -blower 
casing.  If the fan seized or was prevented from turning for any reason, the electric motor 
would be driving the rubberised fan belts around a stationary pulley .  Slipping drive belt s can 
cause significant heat, sufficient to begin a fire if combustible material is present .  There was 
evidence of charred remains within the fan casing, but it could not be established whether 
they were the cause or a result of the fire.  
4.2.19.  The Fire Service  report found this potential source of ignition to be  the “most probable cause”  
but still concluded that the cause of the fire was “unknown”.   The Commission concluded that 
there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the fan unit was the ignition source for 
the fire, but that it could not be excluded.  
Finding s 
1. The seat of the fire was located within bales of empty polypropylene bags 
stored in the fishmeal bagging room on the fish processing deck.  
2. The Commission was not able to establish conclusively the source of ignition 
for the fire.  However, it was about as likely as not to have been either the 
failure of a fluorescent light fitting or a failure within a fan unit, both of which 
were located above the seat of the fire.  
4.3. Crew response  
4.3.1.  The crew performed a fire drill once per trip.  When interviewed the crew were aware of their 
responsibilities should a fire occur.   When they discovered the fire the crew responded quickly 
and their actions were in accordance with the instructions containe d in the Safe Ship 
Management Manual.  
4.3.2.  First responders began fighting the fire with appliances immediately to hand.  One crew 
member notified the bridge and officer  of the watch of the situation, and the remainder of the 
crew began mustering.  
4.3.3.  The Commiss ion did not identify any safety issues arising from the actions of the crew. The 
crew responded with decisive command and control of the situation.  
4.4. Detecting the f ire  
4.4.1.  The l ocation of fir e detectors in the fish processing factory was not prescribed under  Maritime 
Rule s Part 40D .  The vessel was designed with the fishmeal bagging room separated from the 
fish factory by a plywood bulkhead , and hence  it could be totally enclosed .  It was not required 
by the Maritime Rules to be treated as a separate compartment with respect to the fire plan.  
There was a fire detector located outside the compartment and another above the fish 
processing plant , but none had been fitted inside the bagging room.  
4.4.2.  How the fire started , and how much ti me elapsed b efore the crew noticed smoke, were  not 
determined.  When the crew noticed smoke the fire had taken hold and spread quickly .  The 
early detection of fires is critical for preventing their spreading and thereby minimising the 
damage caused.  Had a fire detector been fitted in the  fishmeal  bagging room it would have 
alerted the crew earlier and may have improved their chances of successfully extinguishing 
the fire  before it spread to the rest of the fish processing deck .  
4.4.3.  The arrangement was compli ant with Maritime Rules.  However, fire protection rules are a 
minimum standard and do not exclude a vessel’s managers and crew from making their own 
assessment s of the risks and exceeding the minimum requirements in the interests of safety.

 4.5. Contain ing the fire  
4.5.1.  A critical aspect of fire fighting is starv ing the fire of oxygen. This is achieved by closing off all 
openings through which air can enter a space.  In this case there were  32 ventilation ducts 
that allow ed air to be suppli ed to the various compa rtments in the vessel.  Three of these  
supplied air to the fish processing deck.  Each ventilation duct  had a hinged flap that could be 
closed to shut off the flow of air. The flap was normally propped open by a strut , which was  
attached to the inside of t he flap.  When the strut was dislodged it w ould naturally hang down 
and prevent the flap being fully closed.  In order to close and secure the flap  fully, the free end 
of the strut had to  be folded up behind the flap . 
4.5.2.  Figure 4 shows t he ventilator flap in its fully open position .  The ventilator flap is hinged at the 
top and gravity allows  it to swing shut , provided the strut is folded up behind the flap as it 
swings down.  
4.5.3.  The operation and inspection of the ventilator flaps were  included in the planned mai ntenance 
system and the flaps were regularly checked by the crew.  They were also operated during 
planned fire drills.  
4.5.4.  During the post -fire examination the flaps were able to be closed and secured as designed , 
and the master said they had been closed duri ng the firefighting effort.   However, during the 
fire the crew found it difficult to close the flaps  when unable to see the mechanism through 
the dense smoke, and were hindered further by the intense heat and  their manoeuvrability 
being hampered by the fir efighting suits and breathing apparatus.   
4.5.5.  Fighting fires on board a ship is a time of high stress for the crew, who are working under 
difficult conditions, as this case demonstrates.  For this reason mechanisms for shutting down 
ventilators in the event of  fire should be quick, easy and intuitive to operate.  The design of the 
ones on board the Amaltal  Columbia  did not meet these criteria.  
4.5.6.  The vessel had been  built before the current Maritime Rule s Part 40D came into force in 
2000, and the rule applied to new-builds and vessels undergoing major refit, neither of which 
applied to  the Amaltal Columbia .  
4.5.7.  When the vessel was allowed to be ‘grandfathered’12 into the safe ship management system , 
compliance  with Maritime Rule s 40D was accepted.   
4.5.8.  Regardless of whet her the fire flaps were compliant with the Maritime Rules or not, from a risk 
perspective the owner should have consider ed altering the design of the flaps to make them 
quick, easy and intuitive to use.  
4.5.9.  Owing  to the damage caused by the fire, it could not be established why the crew were unable 
to close the door to the fishmeal bagging room when fighting the fire.  Fully closing the door 
would have helped to prevent the spread of fire.  
                                                        
12 ‘Grandfathering’ is a provision in which an old rule continues to apply to an existing vessel  while a new rule 
will apply to all future vessels . Those exempt from the new rule are said to have  grandfather rights .

 4.6. Fuelling  the fire  
4.6.1.  The fish processing factory was lined with plastic sheeting as required by the rules for food 
safety.   However, t he rules only consider food safety and not  the consequences in the event of 
a fire.   
4.6.2.  The plastic lining melted and appeared to have burnt during the fire , producing thick , acrid 
smoke that hindered initial firefighting effort s.  An example of the burnt and melted plastic 
lining can be seen in Figure 6.  Most plastics are highly flammable and will accelerate the 
spread of  a fire. 
4.6.3.  Nobody knew  the fire  rating of the plastic lining .  Current maritime rules require that such 
materials are fire retardant so as to slow or help prevent the spread of fire.  As with the other 
aspects of ship design referred to above , the vessel had been  built before Pa rt 40D came into 
force, and requirements around fire -retardant linings had not applied.   
4.6.4.  From a risk perspective, operators should consider the fire -retardant qualities  of materials  
used in all areas of a ship prone to fire, especially when changing or refitting any space.

4.7. Risk 
4.7.1.  Maritime rules lay out a set of minimum standards with which  ships must comply.  As lessons 
are learnt from accidents and incide nts, and advances in technology prompt safer systems, 
the maritime rules evolve to reflect these advances.  
4.7.2.  As maritime rules change or evolve, there are inevitably grandfathering provisions to avoid 
unrealistic costs being imposed on owners of existing ves sels.  However, a concept of safety 
management systems is that owners and operators should take a risk -based approach to their 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report MO -2012 -203 operations.  Hazards must be identified  and risks must be assessed and reduced to as low as 
reasonably practicable to prevent dam age to property and harm to people.  
4.7.3.  This means that owners and operators cannot rely solely on compliance with the minimum 
technical standards laid out in maritime rules for meeting their obligations under the other 
various rules and regulations . 
4.7.4.  Several e xamples have been  given above of equipment and systems comply ing with the rules 
of the day but where , if a risk -based approach had been take n, several improvements could 
have been made that may have prevented or minimised the consequences of this fire.  
4.7.5.  The fire on  board the Amaltal Columbia  occurred during the time that safe ship managemen t 
systems were used to manage  the safety of vessels.  Since that time Maritime New Zealand’s 
Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS) has come into effect.  Since MOSS was i ntroduced 
Maritime New Zealand has been actively encouraging operators to take a robust, risk -based 
approach to managing the risks in their operations.  Maritime N ew Zealand  has been 
promoting this message through education material and publications as wel l as active  
engagement with operators. The Commission acknowledges Maritime New Zealand ’s 
approach and does not make a recommendation on this issue.   
 
Findings  
3. The crew had difficulty  completely closing the flaps on the ventilation ducts 
to the fish processing deck where the fire was located, which would have 
hindered their  attempts to contain the spread of the fire.  
4. The fire flaps designed for closing off ventilation ducts in the even t of a fire 
met the minimum standards prescribed in maritime rules and were capable 
of being fully closed and secured.  However, their design meant they were 
not quick, easy and intuitive to operate.  
5. From a risk perspective, the operator should consider am ending the design 
of the closing arrangement on all the ventilation ducts to allow quick and 
easy closing in the event of a fire.  
6. It could not be established whether the material  used to line the fish 
processing deck  had fire -retardant properties , but it a ppeared to have 
burned and likely  accelerated the spread of fire.  
7. The Amaltal Columbia ’s design and systems for the prevention, detection, 
containment and fighting of a fire met the standards of the applicable 
maritime rules; however, there were some  aspects that could have been 
improved with a more r isk-based approach to operations.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The seat of the fire was located within bales of empty polypropylene bags stored in the 
fishmeal bagging room on the fish processing deck.  
5.2. The Commission was  not able to establish  conclusively  the source of ignition for the fire.  
However, it was about as likely than not to have been either the failure of a fluorescent light 
fitting or a failure within a fan unit, both of which were located above the seat of t he fire.  
5.3. The crew had difficulty  completely closing the flaps on the ventilation ducts to the fish 
processing deck where the fire was located, which would have hindered their  attempts to 
contain the spread of the fire.  
5.4. The fire flaps designed for closing o ff ventilation ducts in the event of a fire met the minimum 
standards prescribed in maritime rules and were capable of being fully closed and secured.  
However, their design meant they were not quick, easy and intuitive to operate.  
5.5. From a risk perspective,  the operator should consider amending the design of the closing 
arrangement on all the ventilation ducts to allow quick and easy closing in the event of a fire.  
5.6. It could not be established whether the material  used to line the fish processing deck had fir e-
retardant properties , but it appeared to have burned and likely accelerated the spread of fire.  
5.7. The Amaltal Columbia ’s design and systems for the prevention, detection, containment and 
fighting of a fire met the standards of the applicable maritime rules ; however, there were

General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
None identified .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
No new recommendations identified .

 Final report MO -2012 -203 8. Key l essons  
8.1. The e arly detection of fires is critical to preventing their taking hold and spreading.  
8.2. Older -style fluorescent light fittings are more prone to failure and to start a fire than more 
modern fittings.  Operators of older ships should consider the risk of not replacing such lights 
with more modern and safer lights . 
8.3. Arrangements that are designed to c lose off a space and contain a fire need to be quick, easy 
and intuitive to use, taking account of the conditions the crew are likely to encounter in a real 
fire. 
8.4. The use of fire -retardant materials in the construction and fit -out of spaces on board ships will 
help to prevent the ignition and spreading of fires.
