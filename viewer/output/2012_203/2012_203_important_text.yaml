  \ on board a vessel has t he potential for loss of life, serious injury and \nsignificant\
  \ damage to the vessel .  \n4.1.2.  Ship systems and procedures must deal with the\
  \ prevention, detection, contain ment and \nfighting of a fire, without the aid\
  \ of external emergency services.  Early detection and action \nare paramount. \
  \  In this case the shipboard response to the fire followed standard procedures\
  \ \nand was well  conducted by the crew.  \n4.1.3.  The Commission has n ot been\
  \ able to determine  conclusively  the cause of the fire .  However, \nseveral safety\
  \ issues have been identified that either did hamper or could have hampered the\
  \ \ndetection of and response to the fire:  \n\uF0B7 the location of fire detector\
  \ sensors  \n\uF0B7 the flammability  of some materials used on the fish processing\
  \ deck  \n\uF0B7 the design of the closures on the ventilation grilles around the\
  \ fish processing deck . \n4.1.4.  The following sections discuss  the potential\
  \ sources of ignition for the fire and each of these \nsafety issues.  \n4.2. The\
  \ fi re \n4.2.1.  The seat of the fire was in the fishmeal bagging room located\
  \ at the forward port side of the \nfish processing factory (shown in Figure 1).\
  \ The fishmeal bagging room of the Amaltal \nColumbia 's sister vessel is nearly\
  \ identical  in layout and content .  A photograph of it is \nreproduced i n Figure\

  \ from approximately the same position as Figure 2  \n4.2.3.  There were six potential\
  \ sources of ignition identified ; three were discounted as causal and \nthe remaining\
  \ three  were inconclusive . \nPotential sources of ignition that were discounted\
  \  \n4.2.4.  A fan powered by an electric motor was used to  move fishmeal from\
  \ the processing plant to \nthe bagging room.  It would have been  possible for\
  \ the electric motor to overheat  and catch \nfire, and for burning debris to fall\
  \ onto the bales of empty polypropylene fishmeal bags stored \nbelow .  However,\
  \ the interior of the electric motor was undamaged ; the damage to the electric\
  \ \nmotor was  to its exterior as a result of the fire.  The Commission determined\
  \ that the electric \nmotor for the fishmeal fan  was not the source of ignition.\
  \  \n4.2.5.  Two luggage bags  were stored on top of the bales of fishmeal bags.\
  \  One bag contained \nclothing .  The other bag contained a laptop computer.  Although\
  \ the battery of the laptop  \ncomputer  could have been  a potential source of\
  \ ignition , the laptop was neither plugged in nor \nbeing charged .  An examination\
  \ of the laptop showed that the battery and other internal  parts  \nof the computer\
  \ had  not failed .  The only damage it had suffered was external damage caused\
  \ \nby the fire.  The Commission determined that the laptop  was not the so urce\
  \ of ignition . \n4.2.6.  It is known that f ishmeal  stored in bulk can spontaneously\
  \  combust from the heat generated \nby oxidation of the fishmeal.   However, full\
  \ bags of fishmeal were not stored in the bagging \nroom .  The only fishmeal present\
  \ in the bagging room would have been any residue within the \nbagging plant  or\
  \ small amounts on the deck .  The Commission determine d that spontaneous \ncombustion\
  \ of fishmeal was not a source of ignition.  \nPotential sources of ignition  that\
  \ could not be discounted  \nFluorescent lights  (safety issue)  \n4.2.7.  The bagging\
  \ room was lit by fluorescent lights.  Fluorescent light fittings rely on an internal\
  \ \ncomponent called 'ballast', which  protect s the light s from variations in\
  \ electrical voltage.  Th e \nballast in some fluorescent light fittings manufactured\
  \ before 2000 was made of pitch.  Such \nlight fittings have been known to malfunction\
  \ and overheat.  Overheating can cause the pitch \nto liquefy and ignite , which\
  \ in turn may result in burning pitch fal ling onto whatever is below \n  \nFinal\
  \ report MO -2013 -203 \n<< Page 9 >>\n the light fitting11.  The Amaltal Columbia\
  \  had been  built in 1991 and the fluorescent light \nfittings installed then.\
  \   \n4.2.8.  The bales of polypropylene bags used for the fishmeal were stored\
  \ under the fluorescent light \nfitting.  Polypr opylene is a highly flammable material\
  \ and would have provided a good source \nof fuel for the fire.  It also burns with\
  \ a thick , black , acrid smoke, similar to what was observed \non the fish processing\
  \ deck in the early stages of the fire.  \n4.2.9.  The ballast in flu orescent lights\
  \ is known to fail for a number of reasons, including: leaving \nburned -out tubes\
  \ in the fitting ; using the wrong -sized tubes ; incorrect wiring ; incorrect line\
  \ \nvoltage ; operation at temperatures below or above the rated limits ; power\
  \ surges ; and age.  \n4.2.10.  There was no conclusive evidence that the fluorescent\
  \ light fitting was the source of ignition \nbecause the light fitting was totally\
  \ consumed by the fire.  However, for the reasons given \nabove the possibility\
  \ could not be ruled out.  \n4.2.11.  Modern  fluore scent light fittings use a\
  \ different type of ballast.  H owever, there has never \nbeen a requirement to\
  \ replace the older type  on existing ships.  \n4.2.12.  Safety management systems\
  \ (and more recently MOSS  [Maritime Operator Safety System] ) \nrequire ship owners\
  \ to take  a risk -based approach to their ship operations.  The risk to any \n\
  vessel that is still fitted with these older -style fluorescent light fittings could\
  \  be high.   Therefore \nship owners should consider checking and/or replacing\
  \ them on a voluntary basis, as th ey \nrepresent a safety issue for any ship where\
  \ they are fitted.  \nElectrical extension lead  (safety issue)  \n4.2.13.  An electrical\
  \ extension lead had been run from a power outlet  in the fish processing factory\
  \ , \nalong behind a locker and then  through a redundant pipe duct in the steel\
  \ -framed wooden \nbulkhead that formed the fishmeal bagging room.  The extension\
  \ lead had been permanently \nrigged to supply power to a knife sharpener inside\
  \ the bagging room .  \n4.2.14.  Electrical cables on ships are normally run in\
  \ conduits or secured to cable tracks to prevent \nthe vibration associated with\
  \ operating ships at sea damaging the insulation. The extension \nlead did not comply\
  \ with industry best practice.  It was not secured a long its length  and was \n\
  free to abrade against the bulkhead or where it passed through the pipe duct.  \n\
  4.2.15.  Under Maritime Rules 40D.30 and 32, changes to the electrical system were\
  \ subject to plan \napproval, class surveys and inspection.  The system was also\
  \ su bject to routine planned \nmaintenance. However, because of the ad -hoc nature\
  \ of fitting the extension lead there was \nno record of it in the planned maintenance\
  \ system.  The presence of the cable was not \nimmediately obvious, so it is possible\
  \  that its condit ion had not been checked since fitting.  \n4.2.16.  Using an\
  \ electrical extension lead on board a vessel is not necessarily unsafe, as long\
  \ as it is \nfit for purpose  and fitted to industry best practice and its condition\
  \ is regularly examined as \npart of a planned maint enance routine.  \n4.2.17.\
  \  Worn insulation can result in an earth -fault or short -circuiting and consequent\
  \ arcing or a \nbuild -up of heat.  Any build -up of heat can cause ignition if\
  \ a suitable source of combustible \nmaterial is present, such as residual fishmeal\
  \ or pol ypropylene  bags .  However , the most likely \nlocation for abrasion to\
  \ insulation to occur was not in the immediate vicinity of combustible \nmaterial\
  \ , and no equipment was plugged in to the extension lead at the time .  Therefore,\
  \ the \nCommission concluded , it was very unlikely that the power lead was the\
  \ ignition source for the \nfire, but the possibility could not be excluded.  \n\

  \ MO -2012 -203 The fishmeal fan unit  \n4.2.18.  The fishmeal fan  was fitted with\
  \ drive belts  to transfer torque from the electric motor to the \nfan.  The electr\
  \ ic motor, the drive belts and the fan were enclosed within the fan -blower \n\
  casing.  If the fan seized or was prevented from turning for any reason, the electric\
  \ motor \nwould be driving the rubberised fan belts around a stationary pulley .\
  \  Slipping drive belt s can \ncause significant heat, sufficient to begin a fire\
  \ if combustible material is present .  There was \nevidence of charred remains\
  \ within the fan casing, but it could not be established whether \nthey were the\
  \ cause or a result of the fire.  \n4.2.19.  The Fire Service  report found this\
  \ potential source of ignition to be  the \"most probable cause\"  \nbut still concluded\
  \ that the cause of the fire was \"unknown\".   The Commission concluded that \n\
  there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the fan unit was the ignition\
  \ source for \nthe fire, but that it could not be excluded.  \nFinding s \n1. The\
  \ seat of the fire was located within bales of empty polypropylene bags \nstored\
  \ in the fishmeal bagging room on the fish processing deck.  \n2. The Commission\
  \ was not able to establish conclusively the source of ignition \nfor the fire.\
  \  However, it was about as likely as not to have been either the \nfailure of a\
  \ fluorescent light fitting or a failure within a fan unit, both of which \nwere\
  \ located above the seat of the fire.  \n4.3. Crew response  \n4.3.1.  The crew\
  \ performed a fire drill once per trip.  When interviewed the crew were aware of\
  \ their \nresponsibilities should a fire occur.   When they discovered the fire\
  \ the crew responded quickly \nand their actions were in accordance with the instructions\
  \ containe d in the Safe Ship \nManagement Manual.  \n4.3.2.  First responders began\
  \ fighting the fire with appliances immediately to hand.  One crew \nmember notified\
  \ the bridge and officer  of the watch of the situation, and the remainder of the\
  \ \ncrew began mustering.  \n4.3.3.  The Commiss ion did not identify any safety\
  \ issues arising from the actions of the crew. The \ncrew responded with decisive\
  \ command and control of the situation.  \n4.4. Detecting the f ire  \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ l ocation of fir e detectors in the fish processing factory was not prescribed\
  \ under  Maritime \nRule s Part 40D .  The vessel was designed with the fishmeal\
  \ bagging room separated from the \nfish factory by a plywood bulkhead , and hence\
  \  it could be totally enclosed .  It was not required \nby the Maritime Rules to\
  \ be treated as a separate compartment with respect to the fire plan.  \nThere was\
  \ a fire detector located outside the compartment and another above the fish \n\
  processing plant , but none had been fitted inside the bagging room.  \n4.4.2. \
  \ How the fire started , and how much ti me elapsed b efore the crew noticed smoke,\
  \ were  not \ndetermined.  When the crew noticed smoke the fire had taken hold and\
  \ spread quickly .  The \nearly detection of fires is critical for preventing their\
  \ spreading and thereby minimising the \ndamage caused.  Had a fire detector been\
  \ fitted in the  fishmeal  bagging room it would have \nalerted the crew earlier\
  \ and may have improved their chances of successfully extinguishing \nthe fire \
  \ before it spread to the rest of the fish processing deck .  \n4.4.3.  The arrangement\
  \ was compli ant with Maritime Rules.  However, fire protection rules are a \nminimum\
  \ standard and do not exclude a vessel's managers and crew from making their own\
  \ \nassessment s of the risks and exceeding the minimum requirements in the interests\
  \ of safety.  \n  \nFinal report MO -2013 -203 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.5. Contain ing\
  \ the fire  \n4.5.1.  A critical aspect of fire fighting is starv ing the fire of\
  \ oxygen. This is achieved by closing off all \nopenings through which air can enter\
  \ a space.  In this case there were  32 ventilation ducts \nthat allow ed air to\
  \ be suppli ed to the various compa rtments in the vessel.  Three of these  \nsupplied\
  \ air to the fish processing deck.  Each ventilation duct  had a hinged flap that\
  \ could be \nclosed to shut off the flow of air. The flap was normally propped open\
  \ by a strut , which was  \nattached to the inside of t he flap.  When the strut\
  \ was dislodged it w ould naturally hang down \nand prevent the flap being fully\
  \ closed.  In order to close and secure the flap  fully, the free end \nof the strut\
  \ had to  be folded up behind the flap . \n4.5.2.  Figure 4 shows t he ventilator\
  \ flap in its fully open position .  The ventilator flap is hinged at the \ntop\
  \ and gravity allows  it to swing shut , provided the strut is folded up behind\
  \ the flap as it \nswings down.  \n4.5.3.  The operation and inspection of the ventilator\
  \ flaps were  included in the planned mai ntenance \nsystem and the flaps were regularly\
  \ checked by the crew.  They were also operated during \nplanned fire drills.  \n\
  4.5.4.  During the post -fire examination the flaps were able to be closed and secured\
  \ as designed , \nand the master said they had been closed duri ng the firefighting\
  \ effort.   However, during the \nfire the crew found it difficult to close the\
  \ flaps  when unable to see the mechanism through \nthe dense smoke, and were hindered\
  \ further by the intense heat and  their manoeuvrability \nbeing hampered by the\
  \ fir efighting suits and breathing apparatus.   \n4.5.5.  Fighting fires on board\
  \ a ship is a time of high stress for the crew, who are working under \ndifficult\
  \ conditions, as this case demonstrates.  For this reason mechanisms for shutting\
  \ down \nventilators in the event of  fire should be quick, easy and intuitive to\
  \ operate.  The design of the \nones on board the Amaltal  Columbia  did not meet\
  \ these criteria.  \n4.5.6.  The vessel had been  built before the current Maritime\
  \ Rule s Part 40D came into force in \n2000, and the rule applied to new-builds\
  \ and vessels undergoing major refit, neither of which \napplied to  the Amaltal\
  \ Columbia .  \n4.5.7.  When the vessel was allowed to be 'grandfathered'12 into\
  \ the safe ship management system , \ncompliance  with Maritime Rule s 40D was accepted.\
  \   \n4.5.8.  Regardless of whet her the fire flaps were compliant with the Maritime\
  \ Rules or not, from a risk \nperspective the owner should have consider ed altering\
  \ the design of the flaps to make them \nquick, easy and intuitive to use.  \n4.5.9.\
  \  Owing  to the damage caused by the fire, it could not be established why the\
  \ crew were unable \nto close the door to the fishmeal bagging room when fighting\
  \ the fire.  Fully closing the door \nwould have helped to prevent the spread of\
  \ fire.  \n                                                        \n12 'Grandfathering'\
  \ is a provision in which an old rule continues to apply to an existing vessel \
  \ while a new rule \nwill apply to all future vessels . Those exempt from the new\
  \ rule are said to have  grandfather rights . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report MO\

  \ MO -2013 -203 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.6. Fuelling  the fire  \n4.6.1.  The fish processing\
  \ factory was lined with plastic sheeting as required by the rules for food \nsafety.\
  \   However, t he rules only consider food safety and not  the consequences in the\
  \ event of \na fire.   \n4.6.2.  The plastic lining melted and appeared to have\
  \ burnt during the fire , producing thick , acrid \nsmoke that hindered initial\
  \ firefighting effort s.  An example of the burnt and melted plastic \nlining can\
  \ be seen in Figure 6.  Most plastics are highly flammable and will accelerate the\
  \ \nspread of  a fire. \n4.6.3.  Nobody knew  the fire  rating of the plastic lining\
  \ .  Current maritime rules require that such \nmaterials are fire retardant so\
  \ as to slow or help prevent the spread of fire.  As with the other \naspects of\
  \ ship design referred to above , the vessel had been  built before Pa rt 40D came\
  \ into \nforce, and requirements around fire -retardant linings had not applied.\
  \   \n4.6.4.  From a risk perspective, operators should consider the fire -retardant\
  \ qualities  of materials  \nused in all areas of a ship prone to fire, especially\
  \ when changing or refitting any space.  \nmelted plastic liningmelted plastic lining\n\
  \ \nFigure 6 \nPhoto taken in fish processing factory  \n4.7. Risk \n4.7.1.  Maritime\
  \ rules lay out a set of minimum standards with which  ships must comply.  As lessons\
  \ \nare learnt from accidents and incide nts, and advances in technology prompt\
  \ safer systems, \nthe maritime rules evolve to reflect these advances.  \n4.7.2.\
  \  As maritime rules change or evolve, there are inevitably grandfathering provisions\
  \ to avoid \nunrealistic costs being imposed on owners of existing ves sels.  However,\
  \ a concept of safety \nmanagement systems is that owners and operators should take\
  \ a risk -based approach to their \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report MO -2012 -203\
  \ operations.  Hazards must be identified  and risks must be assessed and reduced\
  \ to as low as \nreasonably practicable to prevent dam age to property and harm\
  \ to people.  \n4.7.3.  This means that owners and operators cannot rely solely\
  \ on compliance with the minimum \ntechnical standards laid out in maritime rules\
  \ for meeting their obligations under the other \nvarious rules and regulations\
  \ . \n4.7.4.  Several e xamples have been  given above of equipment and systems\
  \ comply ing with the rules \nof the day but where , if a risk -based approach had\
  \ been take n, several improvements could \nhave been made that may have prevented\
  \ or minimised the consequences of this fire.  \n4.7.5.  The fire on  board the\
  \ Amaltal Columbia  occurred during the time that safe ship managemen t \nsystems\
  \ were used to manage  the safety of vessels.  Since that time Maritime New Zealand's\
  \ \nMaritime Operator Safety System (MOSS) has come into effect.  Since MOSS was\
  \ i ntroduced \nMaritime New Zealand has been actively encouraging operators to\
  \ take a robust, risk -based \napproach to managing the risks in their operations.\
  \  Maritime N ew Zealand  has been \npromoting this message through education material\
  \ and publications as wel l as active  \nengagement with operators. The Commission\
  \ acknowledges Maritime New Zealand 's \napproach and does not make a recommendation\
  \ on this issue.   \n \nFindings  \n3. The crew had difficulty  completely closing\
  \ the flaps on the ventilation ducts \nto the fish processing deck where the fire\
  \ was located, which would have \nhindered their  attempts to contain the spread\
  \ of the fire.  \n4. The fire flaps designed for closing off ventilation ducts in\
  \ the even t of a fire \nmet the minimum standards prescribed in maritime rules\
  \ and were capable \nof being fully closed and secured.  However, their design meant\
  \ they were \nnot quick, easy and intuitive to operate.  \n5. From a risk perspective,\
  \ the operator should consider am ending the design \nof the closing arrangement\
  \ on all the ventilation ducts to allow quick and \neasy closing in the event of\
  \ a fire.  \n6. It could not be established whether the material  used to line the\
  \ fish \nprocessing deck  had fire -retardant properties , but it a ppeared to have\
  \ \nburned and likely  accelerated the spread of fire.  \n7. The Amaltal Columbia\
  \ 's design and systems for the prevention, detection, \ncontainment and fighting\
  \ of a fire met the standards of the applicable \nmaritime rules; however, there\
  \ were some  aspects that could have been \nimproved with a more r isk-based approach\
  \ to operations.  \n \n  \n  \nFinal report MO -2013 -203 \n<< Page 15 >>"
