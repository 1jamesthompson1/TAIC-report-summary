","0.0","40.0","The incident was primarily caused by human error, where the fuel-transfer tubes were improperly cleaned with a milling solution, leading to damage and fuel leaks (""The fuel leak was confirmed as being from the fuel-transfer tubes"" (4.2)). Additionally, there was an assumption that the occurrence was minor, leading to a misclassification and delayed response (""by not selecting the 'major' classification option when entering the occurrence into the safety information system, the classification defaulted to 'minor'"" (4.8)).
","34.641","6.667","While the document does not explicitly mention inadequate training as a cause, it does state that aircraft maintainers were taught not to clean critical-fit anodized alloy engine parts using a milling solution (""Aircraft maintainers were taught not to clean critical-fit anodised alloy engine parts using a milling solution"" (4.3)). This suggests that the error may have occurred due to a lack of adherence to training or a gap in competency.
","5.774","0.0","There is no information provided in the document that suggests a lack of training or familiarity with equipment contributed to the incident.
","0.0","3.333","The document suggests that the pilot could have made better use of available resources, such as making a distress call to ensure priority landing and alerting emergency services (""It would, therefore, have been more prudent for the pilot to make a distress call"" (4.6)).
","2.887","10.0","The cleaning of the fuel-transfer tubes in a milling solution was contrary to good engineering practice and the manufacturer's approval, indicating a failure to adhere to safety procedures (""This had had the effect of removing the anodised coating and shrinking the overall dimensions of the tubes"" (4.2)).
","0.0","6.667","The inability to identify the facility where the non-approved cleaning occurred suggests a potential issue with safety culture, as there was no record or accountability for the improper maintenance practice (""Despite a review of maintenance records... the facility where the tubes had been removed and cleaned in a non-approved manner could not be identified"" (4.2)).
","2.887","6.667","The misclassification of the incident as minor due to the data registrar not selecting the ""major"" classification option indicates a failure in risk management and analysis (""by not selecting the 'major' classification option when entering the occurrence into the safety information system, the classification defaulted to 'minor'"" (4.8)).
