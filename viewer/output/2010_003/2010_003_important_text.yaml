  \ inquiry because of the potential consequence s of the failure of \ncritical engine\
  \ components for flight safety.  The early indications that the fuel-transfer  tubes\
  \ \ncould have been out of specification or were unapproved components were viewed\
  \ seriously.  \nAlthough in this case the components were found to be the approved\
  \ type, unapproved \naircraft parts entering the aviation system is a serious concern\
  \ to the industry and one that \nwas the subject of a previous Commission report\
  \ (TAIC, 1996).  \n4.2. The fuel leak was confirmed as being from the fuel-transfer\
  \  tube s.  The tubes were \ndetermined to be genuine aircraft parts, but had at\
  \ some time been cleaned in a milling \nsolution.  This had had the effect of removing\
  \ the anodised coating and shrinking the overall \ndimensions of the tubes.  As\
  \ a result, the o -rings did not provide a snug fit when installed and \ntherefore\
  \ could move with changes in fuel pressure.  Eventually the o -rings deteriorated\
  \ \nthrough chipping and rolling to allow fuel under pressure to leak from the tubes.\
  \  Despite a \nreview of maintenance records, e nquir ies with relevant New Zealand\
  \ maintenance \norganisations and the assistance of the FAA, the facility where\
  \ the tubes had been removed \nand cleaned in a non -approved manner could not be\
  \ identified.  \n4.3. Aircraft maintainers were taught not to clean critical -fit\
  \ anodised alloy engine parts using a \nmilling solution, so the manufacturer did\
  \ not specifically state that it was an unapproved \nmethod.  The response from\
  \ New Zealand PT6 engine operators to the CAA notice of 7 April \n2010 suggested\
  \ that the practice was not present in New Zealand and that this case was \nlikely\
  \ to have been an isolated occurrence.  \n4.4. The major concern of the maintainer\
  \ was that the fuel-transfer  tubes might  not have been \ngenuine parts and other\
  \ aircraft and operators could have been exposed to  a similar failure.  \nThe maintainer\
  \ was therefore being proactive in attaching additional information to the \nincident\
  \ report form and emailing  the CAA again 5 weeks later to repeat the concern. \
  \ \n4.5. Although the outcome of the forced landing incident was no inj ury and\
  \ no damage, there were \nlessons to be learnt from the way the incident was handled\
  \ from an emergency response \nperspective.  \n4.6. The implications of reduced\
  \ engine performance and the strong smell of fuel in the cabin were \nsoon identified\
  \ by the pilots and  an immediate turn back to the aerodrome initiated to land as\
  \ \nsoon as possible.  While the landing was successful and the aeroplane was able\
  \ to be taxied \nback to the terminal to discharge the passengers, a fuel leak,\
  \ especially near a hot engine, \ncould hav e been serious.  Fire could have broken\
  \ out at any time or the single engine could \nhave stopped earlier , leaving the\
  \ pilot no option but to either ditch the aeroplane in the sea or \nforce land away\
  \ from the aerodrome.  It would, therefore, have been more pr udent for the pilot\
  \ \nto make a distress call to ensure he obtained priority to land and to alert\
  \ emergency services.  \n4.7. The use of terminology such as \"Mayday \" or \"Pan\
  \ Pan \" clearly indicate s to a listener that a \nstate of distress or urgency\
  \ exist s, and should generate an appropriate level of response.  \nTerms such as\
  \ \"request priority \" to indicate an urgent situation have the potential to create\
  \ \nconfusion and add delays.  The recent examples of miscommunication cited show\
  \ that some \npilots are reluct ant to use appropriate radio phraseology to alert\
  \ air traffic services and other \npilots that an urgent or distress situation exists.\
  \  This reluctance may stem from a desire by \npilots and operators not to attract\
  \ undue attention, for example from the media.   However, it is \nin the interests\
  \ of all that a proactive approach is taken to minimise harm or damage.  The \n\
  Commission has made a recommendation to the Director of Civil Aviation to address\
  \ this \nissue.  \n4.8. The incident was promptly notified to the CAA, and th e\
  \ data registrar correctly identified the \npotential significance of an out -of-specification\
  \ part in the engine fuel system.  Although the \nregistrar alerted the manager\
  \ of safety investigations, by not selecting the \"major \" \nclassification option\
  \ when enteri ng the occurrence into the safety information system, the \nclassification\
  \ defaulted to \"minor \" and the Commission was not automatically and \nimmediately\
  \ notified.  \n  \nReport 10 -003 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.9. The follow -up email sent\
  \ by the maintainer  to the CAA  on 18 March did not alert the data \nanaly sis\
  \ staff to the incorrectly classified notification , possibly because of reliance\
  \ on the \nautomation of the safety information system.  The occurrence classification\
  \ defaulting to \n\"minor \" was a latent fault in the system for which there was\
  \ little defence,  a situation the CAA \nhas since corrected (see Safety actions).\
