","0.0","100.0","The document suggests that maintenance and inspection regimes are the primary factors in the incident. The San Francisco surge was considered minor, and the aeroplane completed another 2 flights without incident (4.5). However, it is possible that the less severe San Francisco event caused some minor compressor damage that was undetected prior to the Auckland event (4.6). The missing high-pressure compressor liner material and the non-embodiment of the 'birdmouth' service bulletin could have reduced the surge margin (4.7). These factors suggest that maintenance and inspection regimes played a significant role in the incident.
