- name: Engine Surge Management
  explanation: Engine surge management is a critical safety theme as it pertains to the proper handling of engine stalls or surges, which can be alarming and potentially damaging. The document states that "modern engine design requirements and operating practices have reduced the frequency and severity of these events" (4.2) and that "provided pilots follow the prescribed flight manual procedures, as they did in these incidents, such events are not critical flight safety hazards" (4.3). This theme is relevant to the accident because the crew's correct response to the engine surge by shutting down the engine minimized further damage (4.8), and the San Francisco engineer's decision to release the airplane back to service after the initial surge was deemed appropriate (4.5).
- name: Maintenance Standards for Aging Aircraft
  explanation: The maintenance standards for aging aircraft is a pertinent safety theme, as it addresses concerns about whether the standard of maintenance declines as airplanes near the end of their service lives. The document questions if "the 3 in-flight shutdowns in a little over 4 months, although involving different airplane and engine types, indicate a reduction in the standard of maintenance of airplanes nearing the end of their service lives with the operator" (4.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). However, it was found that "there were no related circumstances and no evidence that the operator's maintenance practices contributed to any of the events" (5.4), indicating that maintenance standards were upheld despite the aircraft's age.
- name: Predictability and Indicators of Engine Issues
  explanation: Predictability and indicators of engine issues are a safety theme that involves the ability to foresee and detect potential engine problems before they result in incidents. The document highlights that "prior to the surge, the RB211 engine had been operating within its design performance limits and there had been no indication that a stall or surge could occur at either San Francisco or Auckland" (5.2). This theme is relevant because it underscores the challenges in predicting engine surges and the importance of having robust detection systems to prevent such unpredictable events.
- name: Crew Response to Emergencies
  explanation: Crew response to emergencies is a crucial safety theme, focusing on the actions taken by flight crew during unexpected events. In this incident, "the crew acted correctly in shutting down the engine to minimize further damage" (4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), demonstrating the importance of proper training and adherence to emergency procedures. This theme is relevant as the crew's response is a critical factor in ensuring the safety of the flight during an engine surge event.
- name: Engine Performance Monitoring
  explanation: Engine performance monitoring is a safety theme that involves the continuous assessment of engine functionality to ensure safe operation. The document mentions that after the San Francisco surge, "the airplane completed another 2 flights without incident, and engine performance data confirmed that the engine operated correctly during that time" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant to the accident as it highlights the role of ongoing engine performance assessments in validating the airworthiness of an aircraft after an incident.
- name: Impact of Environmental Factors on Engine Performance
  explanation: The impact of environmental factors on engine performance is a safety theme that considers how external conditions can affect engine behavior. The document suggests that the San Francisco event was likely a result of environmental influences on a high-time but serviceable engine (4.7). This theme is relevant to the accident as it acknowledges that environmental factors such as gusty winds and turbulence can contribute to engine stalls (4.4), and understanding these influences is essential for mitigating risks associated with engine performance.
