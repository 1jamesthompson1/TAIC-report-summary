  \ to answer 2 questions : \n\uF0B7 was the decision to release the aeroplane back\
  \ into service after the engine surge in San \nFrancisco appropriate , given that\
  \ a second , apparently related and more serious , surge \noccurred several days\
  \ later ? \n\uF0B7 did the  3 in -flight shutdown s in a little over 4 months, although\
  \  involving different \naeroplane and engine types, indicate a reduction in the\
  \ standard of maintenance of \naeroplanes near ing the end of their service  lives\
  \  with the operator ? \nEngine stalls and surges  \n4.2. An e ngine stall  or surge\
  \ can be frightening  for those on board and is potentially damaging  for \nthe\
  \ engine .  However, modern engine design requirements and operating practice s\
  \ have \nreduce d the frequency and severity of these events , as shown by the high\
  \ levels of reliability .  \nA minor engine stall should  correct itself  before\
  \ any crew intervention can take place.  In some \ncases,  a momentary reduction\
  \ in thrust setting  will allow a stable airflow to be re-establish ed.  \nIn more\
  \ serious cases an engine may need to be shut down , either manually by the pilot\
  \ or \nautomatically by the engine control system.  \n4.3. In the most severe cases\
  \  of RB211  compressor stall , there has not been any s econdary \ndamage outside\
  \ the engine.  The performance requirements for multi -engine aeroplanes are \n\
  such that even after a severe engine surge the safety of continued flight will not\
  \ be \ncompromised  if correctly handled .  Although an engine stall or surge may\
  \  cause engine \ndamage, or reduce performance if the engine has to be shut down,\
  \ p rovided pilots follow the \nprescribed flight manual procedures, as they did\
  \ in these incidents, such events are not \ncritical flight safety hazard s. \n\
  Finding  \n1. Engine surges, while potentially alarming  for passeng ers and possibly\
  \ requiring \nan engine to be shut down , are not critical flight safety hazard\
  \ s. \n4.4. The San Francisco surge occurred on final approach during thrust or\
  \ power adjustments at  a \nlow speed.  The l ocally based engineer was familiar\
  \ with the RB211 engine and correctly \nfollowed the recommended procedure for the\
  \ indicated fault.  No damage was found.  To \nsatisfy himself that the aeroplane\
  \ was airworthy , he went beyond the published requirements \nand checked the weather\
  \ conditions and conducted a high -power ground run on the engine.  \nThe engine\
  \ performed as required and , in the knowledge that gusty winds  and turbulence\
  \ f rom \nother aircraft  could  contribute to a stall, the aeroplane was returned\
  \ to service  after consulting \nthe operator's maintenance control .   \n4.5. The\
  \ surge  at San Francisco was considered  by Air New Zealand to be minor and  the\
  \ aeroplane \ncompleted another 2 flights without incident , and engine performance\
  \ data confirmed that the \nengine operat ed correctly during th at time.  The Commission\
  \ therefore determined that,  with \nthe information available  to him at the time\
  \ , the San Francisco engineer  had made an \nappropriate decision to re lease \
  \ the aeroplane to service.  \n4.6. The surge event during the approach to land\
  \ at Auckland was more severe  and resulted in the \nEGT exceeding the maximum limit.\
  \  This necessitated the shutting down of the engine.  Expert \nadvice was that\
  \ due to the severity of the surge event on approach to Auckland it is probable\
  \ that \nmost, if  not all, of the internal compressor damage was caused during\
  \ this event. However , it is \npossible that the less severe San Francisco event\
  \ caused some minor compressor damage that \nwas undetected prior to the Auckland\
  \ event. If such minor damage occurred du ring the San \nFrancisco event , the engine\
  \ may have had a slightly lower surge margin and therefore been more \nsusceptible\
  \ to surges thereafter .  This is not always the case , however, and one instance\
  \ of a surge \ndoes not necessarily mean that others will follow ; refer manufacturer\
  \ comment in paragraph 3.3.5.   \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Report 11 -005 4.7. The San\
  \ Francisco event was likely a result of environmental influences on a high -time\
  \ but \nserviceable engine ; similarl y for t he Auckland event .  If the missing\
  \ high-pressure compressor \nliner material  had been lost during  normal operation\
  \ s or as a consequence of the San \nFrancisco event , the surge margin would have\
  \ been reduced.  The non -embodiment of the \n'birdmouth' servic e bulletin could\
  \ have reduced the margin further .  However, because of the \ncontinued good EGT\
  \ margin there was unlikely to have been any predictor of a surge or \nanother problem\
  \ that might have led to a surge .   \n4.8. The crew acted correctly  in shutting\
  \ down the engine to minimis e further damage.   The \noperator acted appropriately\
  \ in removing the engine for examination.    \n4.9. These  stall event s were unrelated\
  \ to the 3 other engine in -flight  shutdown  events  since 2000 \nthat had involv\
  \ ed the RB211.  The review of RB211 engine surge events showed that on \naverage\
  \ the rate of occurrence for the operator was below the average for the worldwide\
  \ fleet.  \nNoting the operator's  relatively small fleet, even a single event would\
  \ have varied the average \noccurrenc e rate significantly.  \nFinding s \n2. Prior\
  \ to the surge, t he RB211 engine had been  operating within its design \nperformance\
  \ limits  and there had been  no indication that a stall or surge could \noccur\
  \  at either San Francisco or Auckland.  \n3. With the information availab le to\
  \ him at the time, the San Francisco engineer \nmade an appropriate decision to\
  \ re lease  the aeroplane to service.  \nStandard of maintenance on retiring fleets\
  \  \n4.10.  The 2 other engine events that occurred between May and September 2011\
  \  concerned  \ndifferent aeroplane type s, different engine  types and different\
  \ circumstances.   \n4.11.  The bearing failure on the B oeing 737 aeroplane was\
  \ the first of its type for the operator and \nonly the third worldwide.  There\
  \ was no evidence that maintenance practices mig ht have \nprecipitated  this failure.\
  \   The engine was not high time , having accumulated about the average \ntime for\
  \ the operator's fleet of CFM56 engines.  The reports of engine vibrations had been\
  \ \nproperly investigated and been  found to be within limits.  \n4.12.  The Boeing\
  \ 767 stalls occurred under high power demands shortly after take -off.  The MEC\
  \  \nhad been fitted some 4 months earlier and had operated correctly for the next\
  \ 60 cycles and \n265 hours . It also operated correctly during post -incident bench\
  \ testing.  However, after \nextensive testing the rigging of the MEC during fitment\
  \ remained the most likely cause of the \nincident, possibly initiated by some other\
  \ event.   The bird strike  some 10 days earlier may \nhave been such a factor ,\
  \ but this  could not be substantiated.   \nFinding  \n4. The spate of engine shutdown\
  \  events between May and September 2011 \ninvolved 3 different engine types.  There\
  \ were no related circumstances and no \nevidence that the operator's maintenance\
  \ practices contributed to any of the \nevents.   \n  \n \nReport 11 -005 \n<< Page\
