- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The instructor did not perceive reduced G at the time of the accident and reacted with a previously considered response to an unusual attitude, which was not the recommended procedure for an un-commanded roll (4.2.9). This indicates a possible human error or incorrect assumption about the situation.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The instructor was in current flying and instructional practice and met the CAA requirements to conduct the special training (4.2.5). However, the inquiry considered the content and conduct of the special training due to the number of Robinson helicopter accidents not decreasing as expected following the introduction of the special training (4.1.4). This suggests that training and competency played a role in the accident.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The instructor had safely carried out the intended exercise many times, including with the student earlier in his training (4.1.1). However, the instructor had not followed the recommended procedure for an un-commanded roll that he had been about to review with the student (4.1.4). This indicates that while there was familiarity with the equipment, the training on specific emergency procedures may have been lacking.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not provide specific details on the crew's resource management during the flight, but it does mention that the student recalled the G reducing noticeably before the roll, which the instructor did not (4.2.2). This suggests a possible lack of shared situational awareness, which is a component of CRM.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The instructor did not follow the recommended procedure for an un-commanded roll (4.1.4), and the flight manual's prohibition of demonstrations of the effects of low G was not adhered to (4.3.4). This indicates that adherence to safety procedures was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document suggests that the special training content and conduct may not have been effective in reducing accidents (4.1.4), and there was a lack of standardization in instructor technique and lesson content (4.3.7). This points to organizational safety culture as a contributing factor.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not provide specific information on risk management and analysis processes that were in place or not followed. However, the lack of published guidance on a suitable exercise or recommended power setting for the training exercise suggests a gap in risk management (4.2.4).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The contradiction between the Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73 and the R22 helicopter flight manual regarding the demonstration of low-G conditions indicates an issue with regulatory oversight and compliance (5.3).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The instructor did not perceive reduced G at the time, which suggests a lack of situational awareness (4.2.9). This lack of awareness may have contributed to the accident.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide information on emergency response preparedness or its role in the accident. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document states that there were no technical defects with the helicopter (4.2.1), indicating that maintenance and inspection regimes were not a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of automation or its use in the context of the accident within the document provided. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The weather on the day of the accident was benign, and there was no turbulence that could have caused an inadvertent low-G condition (4.2.1). Therefore, weather conditions did not contribute to the accident.
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The student and instructor had different recollections of the G reduction before the roll (4.2.2), indicating a possible communication breakdown. This could have contributed to the accident by affecting the crew's shared understanding of the situation.
