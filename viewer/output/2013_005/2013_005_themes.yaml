- name: Recognition and Recovery from Un-commanded Rolls
  explanation: The theme of recognizing and recovering from un-commanded rolls is central to this accident, as the instructional flight was specifically meant to review "the recognition of and recovery from an un-commanded right roll" (4.1.1). The instructor was experienced and had carried out the exercise safely many times before, but during the accident flight, the very event they were meant to avoid occurred (4.1.1). The instructor's failure to follow the recommended procedure for an un-commanded roll that he was about to review with the student is highlighted as a reason for the inquiry (4.1.4). This theme is relevant because it directly relates to the accident's occurrence and the instructor's deviation from standard recovery procedures.
- name: Mast Bumping Hazard
  explanation: Mast bumping is a significant safety theme in this accident, as the "extreme attitudes reached by the helicopter during the event presented a great risk of a substantial mast bump" (4.1.2). The rotor head damage confirmed that a mast bump did occur (4.1.2). The risk of mast bumping is not confined to Robinson helicopters but is more likely with helicopters that have two-bladed underslung main rotors, such as the R22 involved in this accident (4.3.1). The potential for mast bumping to be catastrophic makes it a critical safety theme.
- name: Low-G Condition Inducement
  explanation: The inadvertent inducement of a low-G condition is a key safety theme, as the accident's probable cause was "an inadvertent reduction in G during the transition from the flap-forward demonstration to the next exercise" (5.2). The instructor and student's differing recollections of the G-force before the roll and the instructor's higher-than-recommended power setting likely contributed to the high rate of roll if there was a coincident reduction in G (4.2.2, 4.2.4). This theme is relevant because it addresses the flight conditions that likely led to the un-commanded roll.
- name: Special Training Content and Conduct
  explanation: The content and conduct of special training for Robinson helicopter pilots is a safety theme, as the number of accidents had not decreased as expected following the introduction of special training, and all pilots involved in recorded accidents had received this training (4.1.4). The accident underlines the urgency for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to take effective action regarding the content or conduct of the special training (4.3.8). This theme is relevant because it suggests that the current training may not be effectively mitigating the risks associated with flying Robinson helicopters.
- name: Flight Manual Clarity and Emphasis
  explanation: The clarity and emphasis of critical safety information in the flight manual is a safety theme, as the Robinson helicopter flight manuals do not conform to the aviation industry practice for the use of "Warnings" to emphasize flight conditions and operating practices that can cause death or serious injury (4.4). The Commission recommended that the FAA require Robinson to amend its flight manuals to include the use of "Warning" for those operating conditions and practices that involve a risk of personal injury or loss of life (4.4.10). This theme is relevant because it addresses how the presentation of safety information can affect pilot understanding and behavior.
- name: Contradictory Regulatory Requirements
  explanation: Contradictory regulatory requirements are a safety theme, as there is an apparent contradiction between the Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73, which requires dual flight instruction in the effects of low-G maneuvering, and the R22 helicopter flight manual, which prohibits the demonstration of low-G conditions (5.3). This contradiction could lead to confusion among pilots and instructors about the proper training procedures, making it a relevant safety theme for this accident.
