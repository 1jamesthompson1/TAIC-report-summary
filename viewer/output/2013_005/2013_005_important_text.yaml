  \ occurred  during a n instructional flight that was to review  the recognition\
  \ of and \nrecovery from an un -commanded right roll, with an assumed condition\
  \ of low  G.  The instructor \nunderstood the theory of th e effect  and had safely\
  \ carried out the intended exercise  many \ntimes, including with the student earlier\
  \ in his training and another student the day before the \naccident flight.   The\
  \ very thing that was meant to be avoided  happened  instead.  \n4.1.2.  The instructor\
  \ recognised  that the extreme attitude s reached by the helico pter during the\
  \ \nevent present ed a great risk of a substantial mast bump or of the main rotor\
  \  contacting the \nfuselage , either of which could have been catastrophic .  The\
  \ damage to the rotor head  showed \nthat a mast bump did occur . \n4.1.3.  There\
  \ have been  few occasions when an R22 has landed safely after a significant mast\
  \ bump.  \nHowever, in this case the pilot was able to regain control of the helicopter\
  \ by gentle control \ninputs.  The fortunate outcome provided an opportunity  to\
  \ identify  with greater confidenc e the \npossible contributing factors.  \n4.1.4.\
  \  There were a number of reasons for the inquiry also consider ing the content\
  \ and conduct  of \nthe special training : \n\uF0B7 the number of Robinson helicopter\
  \ accidents in New Zealand had not decreased as \nexpected  following the introduction\
  \ of the special training for pilots  \n\uF0B7 all of the pilots involved in the\
  \ recorded accidents had received  the special training  \n\uF0B7 the intended e\
  \ xercise  was a required part of the special training  \n\uF0B7 the exercise  involved\
  \ an experienced helicopter instructor  \n\uF0B7 although the recovery was successful,\
  \ the instructor had not follow ed the \nrecommended procedure  for an un -commanded\
  \ roll that he had been about to review \nwith the student . \n4.2. The c ause of\
  \ th e un-commanded roll  \n4.2.1.  The weather on 30 March 2013 was benign .  There\
  \ was no t urbulence that could  have caused \nan inadvertent  low-G condition.\
  \  There w ere n o technical defects  with the helicopter . \n4.2.2.  The instructor\
  \ said that at the completion of th e flap -forward  demonstration the helicopter\
  \ was \nalmost in level flight  when  it rolled before he made any control movement\
  \  to start the next \nexercise .  However,  if the helicopter  had been still pitching\
  \ down due to the flap -forward effect \nor the instructor  had hastened t he level\
  \ -off (by moving the cyclic stick forward)  in preparation \nfor the roll-recovery\
  \ practice , the G could have reduced slightly.  The student , but not the \ninstructor,\
  \  recalled the G reduc ing noticeably before the roll . \n4.2.3.  The instructor\
  \ said the engine power was approximat ely 22 inches of manifold pressure, or a\
  \ \nlittle less than the normal cruise setting .  Therefore the pitch of the main\
  \ rotor blade s would \nhave been in the normal range and the main rotor RPM was\
  \ very likely at 100% with the \ninstructor in control.  The stude nt did not hear\
  \ the low -RPM warning horn until after the roll \nhad begun . \n4.2.4.  Most of\
  \ the expert instructor s at the forum held in May 2013 had been shown the exercise\
  \ \nand had demonstrated it themselves  prior to the flight manual amendment that\
  \ prohibited \ndemonstrations of the effects of low G.  The  expert  instructors\
  \ suggested that the power \nsetting they had used for the exercise  had probably\
  \ not exceed ed 18 to 20 inches of manifold \npressure , in order t o minimise \
  \ the tail rotor thrust that was the cause of  the rolling moment .  \nSome of them\
  \ were of the view that the higher power used by the instructor in this case would\
  \ \nhave been a factor in the  high rate of roll , if there had been a coincident\
  \ reduction in G .  The \ninstructor accepted th eir view  that the relatively high\
  \ power could have been a contributing \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report AO -2013\
  \ -005 factor .  However, there is no published guidance on a suitable exercise\
  \ or recommended \npower setting, because the  hazard should now  be a discussion\
  \ topic only.  \n4.2.5.  It was not possible to verify t he precise conditions and\
  \ control inputs immediately before the \nsudden roll.  The instructor was in current\
  \ flying and instructional practice, and he met the CAA \nrequirements for  him\
  \ to conduct  the special training .  He understood the usual  cause of an un -\n\
  commanded r ight roll, and had attended the manufacturer's safety  course 16 months\
  \ earlier.  \nIt was very unlikely that he would have  made an abrupt movement \
  \ of the flight controls . \n4.2.6.  The circumstances of this accident suggest\
  \ that it was probable  that a reduced G condition \nwas induced inadvertent ly\
  \ during the transition from the flap -forward demonstration to the \nroll-recovery\
  \ exercise.  A reduced G condition would have been very unlikely  had the instructor\
  \ \ncompleted the flap -forward review and positively achieved stable, straight\
  \ and level flight \nbefore starting the next exercise . \n4.2.7.  The forum  instructors\
  \ considered that the onset of a low -G roll in the R22 was usually benign  \nand\
  \ control was easily recovered , if the roll  occurred at a low airspeed with a\
  \ low engine power \nsetting .  That was also th is instructor's experience.  However,\
  \ he and the student emphasised  \nthat in this case the onset of the roll was sudden\
  \ and the rate of roll was high .  The instructor , \nwith the R22 accident history\
  \ in mind, suggested  that the alarming  rate at which the helicopter \nhad departed\
  \ from controlled flight  indicated that another  factor , such as main rotor \n\
  divergence,  could have been  involved.   However, unless either pilot had made\
  \ a sudden \ncontrol input , the sudden roll was more likely to have been caused\
  \ by  an unintended reduction \nin G combined with  a relatively high power setting\
  \ while  the tail rotor was above the vertical \ncentre of gravity.  \n4.2.8.  Both\
  \ pilots said that an extreme angle of bank occurred before any recovery  was attempted.\
  \  \nThe recommended procedure was designed as the response  to a more benign onset\
  \ of right \nroll.  It has not been possible to determine whether the recommended\
  \ procedure  would have \nbeen successful in recovering the helicopter after it\
  \ had reached  an extreme a ngle of bank . \n4.2.9.  The instructor said he did\
  \ not perce ive reduced G at the time , so he assessed the situation to \nhave been\
  \ different from  the condition he had been  about to review.   As a result, and\
  \ because \nan extreme angle of bank was reached  so quickly , he reacted with his\
  \ previously considered  \nresponse  to an unusual attitude .  He judged it to be\
  \ of critical importance to \"fly\" the main \nrotor so that it would not  strike\
  \ the fuselage .  That rationale w as indirectly supported later by a \nvery experienced\
  \ instructor wh en comment ing on the low-G article  in the CAA magazine  (see \n\
  paragraph 3.6.5): \"The overriding goal for a pilot in a negative G event, especially\
  \ when \naccompanied by un -commanded roll, must always be to keep the disc parallel\
  \ to fuselage \nfloor \".  The writer added , \"this is not to say that the recommended\
  \ recovery procedure should \nnot be applied \" (CAA, 2014, p.22).  \n4.2.10.  Although\
  \ the instructor did not perceive   a low -G condition, his  reaction  to the sudden\
  \ roll  was \nreasonable under the circumstances and not an intentional  disregard\
  \ for a recommended \nprocedure.   \nFinding s \n1. No environ mental condition\
  \ or helicopter defect  caused the un -commanded roll.   \n2. It was probable  that\
  \ the un-commanded roll was caused by an inadvertent reduction \nin G during the\
  \ transition from the flap -forward demonstration to the next exercise, \nwhile\
  \ the  engine power was at a relatively high setting . \n  \n \nFinal report AO\
  \ -2013 -005 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3. Conducting  the special training  \n4.3.1. \
  \ The phenomenon of un -commanded right  roll and the potential hazard of mast bumping\
  \  are \nnot confined  to Robinson helicopters , but they are more likely to be\
  \ encountered with \nhelicopters, like the Robinson designs, that have two -bladed\
  \ underslung main rotor s.  \nKnowledge of these hazards is now included in  the\
  \ helicopter pilot  training  syllab i in New \nZealand and the United States ,\
  \ but the special training  applies only to pilots of the R22 (and, \nin the United\
  \ States, to pilots of the R44). \n4.3.2.  The NTSB credit ed the special training\
  \  required by  SFAR 73 with having reduced the incidence \nof loss -of-main -rotor\
  \ -control accidents in the United States  (NTSB, p.27) .  Such accidents still\
  \ \noccur there , but less often.  Although  the FAA require s instructors who conduct\
  \  the special \ntraining to be specifically endorsed , the CAA d oes not have \
  \ that requirement . \n4.3.3.  The expert instructors  at the  forum  supported\
  \ the specific endorsement of instructors because \nof their sense that the standard\
  \ and effectiveness of the training had become  \"diluted \" over \nsuccessive generations\
  \ of helicopter pilots.   The experts  offered, in support of that view, their \n\
  observation that too many candidates for instructor rating upgrades did not understand\
  \ fully \nall of the special training  theory and requir ements.  However, the experts'\
  \ discussion on the \neffectiveness of recovery methods, while offering valuable\
  \ insight s into the problem of low -G \neffects, showed that there were  diverse\
  \ opinions regarding the special training requirements .. \n4.3.4.  The R22 flight\
  \ manual has prohibited  demonstrations  of low G  since 1995 , but SFAR 73 still\
  \ \nshows a  requirement for dual flight instruction  in \"the effects of low -G\
  \ maneuvers and proper \nrecovery procedures \".  New Zealand adopted SFAR 73 by\
  \ inserting most of the sam e text into \nthe R22  flight manual .  Instructors\
  \ could potentially interpret the wording of SFAR 73 as \nsanctioning the demonstration\
  \ of low -G situations when conducting dual  flight instruction.   \nThere is evidence\
  \ that in -flight demonstrations have continued  to take place in New Zealand, \n\
  and not always without incident.  Of particular concern are reports of demonstrations\
  \ that \namount to experimentation.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the\
  \ pilots asked for \nfurther instruction in the recovery procedur e from a low-G\
  \ roll to restore their confidence after \nwhat has seemed to be a spate of accidents\
  \ involving R22 helicopters.  \n4.3.5.  The Commission  is recommending  that the\
  \ Administrator of the FAA resolve what could \npotentially be contradicting  requirements\
  \ of SFA R 73 and the R22 flight manual . \n4.3.6.  The discussion at  the expert\
  \ instructors' forum suggest ed that  there could be industry support \nfor the\
  \ following changes to the delivery of the special training  in New Zealand:  \n\
  \uF0B7 standardised content and techniques  \n\uF0B7 delivery by  endorsed instructors\
  \ working within a certificated flight training organisation  \n\uF0B7 a specific\
  \ requirement for Robinson helicopter pilots to have current biennial flight review\
  \ s \nin a Robinson  helicopter . \n4.3.7.  These conclusions complement  the recommendations\
  \ made b y the Commission to the \nDirector of Civil Aviation after  inquiry 11\
  \ -003 (TAIC, 201 4).  SFAR 73 prescribed  a \ncomprehensive training response to\
  \ reduce the incidence of R22 accidents, but the CAA \nadopted  the requirements\
  \ with some variations.   The lack of st andardisation in instructor \ntechnique\
  \ and lesson content , identified in report 11 -003,  likely  led to variations\
  \ in pilot \nunderstanding of the special training  goals, and could have been an\
  \ un recognised systemic  \nfactor in earlier  R22 accidents in New Zealan d. \n\
  4.3.8.  Although t he recommendations in inquiry 11 -003 were made by the Commission\
  \ after the \ndate of this accident, the circumstances of this accident underline\
  \ the urgency for the CAA to \ntake effective action.  On 28 August 2014  the CAA\
  \ advised that progress was being made in \nresponse to th ose recommendations.\
  \   Accordingly, no finding or recommendation has been \nmade in this inquiry  regarding\
  \ the content or conduct of the special training . \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\
  \ report AO -2013 -005 Finding  \n3. The section of the United States  Special Federal\
  \ Aviation Regulation No. 73, which  \nrequire s Robinson helicopter pilots to have\
  \ dual flight instruction  in the effects  of low-\nG manoeuvring , appears to contradict\
  \  the R22 hel icopter  flight manual, which \nprohibits the demonstration  of low-G\
  \ condi tions.  \n4.4. Flight manual (clarity of critical information)  \nSafety\
  \ issue - The Robinson helicopter flight manual s do not conform to the aviation\
  \ industry \npractice for the use of \"Warnings \" to emphasise flight conditions\
  \ and operating practices that \ncan cause death or serious injury . \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ purpose of the helicopter  flight manual  \"is to provide an authoritative source\
  \ of \ninformation considered \u2026 necessary for or likely to promote safe operation\
  \  of the helicopter \" \n(FAA, 1999, p.  G33) .   It is an operating guide for\
  \ pilots and contain s the material required by \nnational regulation s to be made\
  \ available to pilots, as well as supplemental information \nprovided by the manufacturer.\
  \  Required information includes the helicopter  limitations, the \nemergency procedures\
  \ , the normal procedures and data necessary for a pilot to determine the \nhelicopter\
  \ performance under various condi tions of, (for example ) weight, altitude and\
  \ air \ntemperature .  The supplem ental information  includes syst ems descriptions\
  \ and the means to \ncalculate the weight and balance of the  helicopter .  Pilots\
  \ are required to have a thorough \nknowledge of the flight manual, which must be\
  \ carried on board.  \n4.4.2.  The R22 flight manual contain s the information \
  \ required by the reg ulations .  Robinson \nHelicopters includes a n additional\
  \ section in the manual that contain s \"Safety Tips and \nNotices \".  The safety\
  \ tips provide generic advice for the safe operation of helicopters like the \n\
  R22.  Many of t he safety notices , which have been issued by Robinson \"as a result\
  \ of various \naccidents and incidents \", also have generic application, but some\
  \ of them specifically address \nhazards that are more likely to affect Robinson\
  \ helicopters ; for example, low rotor RPM and \nlow-G pushovers  (see Appendix\
  \ 3) .  The key messages in some of these notices  have been \nrepeated in the \"\
  Limitations \" section of the flight manual.  The avoidance of a low -G condition\
  \ \nis one such example.  \n4.4.3.  The Commisison has previously commented that\
  \ Robinson helicopter fli ght manuals d id not \nalways contain the text and emphasis\
  \ expected for certain safety critical conditions.21  For \nexample, in 1995 the\
  \ FAA  restricted  the R22 airspeed in turbulent conditions to 70% of the \nmaximum\
  \ permitted speed. 22  In 1998 Robinson issued a safety notice on the subject of\
  \ \nflight in high winds and turbulence, which  noted the potential for a mast bump\
  \ under such \nconditions.  The flight manual ha s been revised several times since\
  \ 1995, but none of the \nFAA-approved sections of the manual refers  to the airspeed\
  \ restriction , or even mention s \n\"turbulence \". 23  As flight in turbulent\
  \ conditions has been cited as a possible cause for a  \nnumber of R22 in-flight\
  \ break -up accidents , it would have been  appropriate to have \nrecognised the\
  \ importance  of the airspeed restrictions by includ ing them in the Limitations\
  \  \nsection of the flight manual . \n4.4.4.  The instructor in th is accident had\
  \ no intention of demonstrating a low -G condition .  He was \nfamiliar with the\
  \ flight manual \"caution \" (paragraph 3.1.3 ) and un derstood the hazard.  \n\
  However,  anecdotal evidence suggested th at, in spite of safety awareness training\
  \ that all \npilots of Robinson helicopters must  complete, not all pilots  fully\
  \ appreciate that a low-G \ncondition in a Robinson helicopter can be fatal .  One\
  \ reason for this could be that  the \nconsequences ( personal  injury or death)\
  \ of entering a low -G condition are not being clearly \narticulated in the Robinson\
  \ helicopter flight manuals, because the manuals are not following \nthe aviation\
  \ industry norm for the use of \"warnings \". \n                               \
  \                         \n21 Inquiry 11 -003, in -flight break -up, ZK -HMU, Robinson\
  \ R22, near Mount Aspiring, 27 April 2011.  \n22 Airworthiness Directive  95-26-04.\
  \ \n23 As at February 2015.  \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -005 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.4.5.\
  \  FAA Advisory Circular 27-1B describes the acceptable means of compliance for\
  \ meet ing the \ncertification requirements  of Federal Aviation Regulation 27 ,\
  \ Certification of Normal Category \nRotorcraft .24  In regard to Regulation 27.1585,\
  \ which deals with  the section on operating \nprocedures  in a flight manual ,\
  \ the advisory circular states, in part:  \nNotes, cautions, and warnings may be\
  \ used to emphasize specific instructions or \ninformation in general accord with\
  \ the following.  \n (i) \"Note\" should be used with respect to matters not directly\
  \ related to safety \nbut which are particularly important  \u2026  \n(ii) \"Caution\"\
  \ should be used with respect to safety matters of a secondary order \nnot immediately\
  \ imminent  \u2026  \n(iii) \"Warning\" should be used with respect  to safety matters\
  \ of a primary order or \nimmediately imminent .   \n4.4.6.  The aviation industry\
  \ has generally interpreted the above words to mean the following :25 \nNote : an\
  \ operating procedure, technique or maintenance condition which is \nconsidered\
  \ essential to empha sise \nCaution : an operating procedure, technique or maintenance\
  \ practice which may \nresult in damage to equipment if not carefully followed \
  \ \nWarning : an operating procedure, technique or maintenance practice which may\
  \ \nresult in personal injury or loss of life  if not carefully followed.  \n4.4.7.\
  \  Robinson , however,  does not use Warning s in its flight manuals , even though\
  \ they contain \nreferences to conditions or practices that could lead to \"a catastrophic\
  \ loss of control \", which \nclearly suggests the likelihood of loss of  life.\
  \  Instead, Robinson  uses the following definition : \nCAUTION  Equipment damge,\
  \ injury , or death can result if procedure or \ninstruction is not followed.  \n\
  4.4.8.  Robinson 's choice  for distinguishing  between Warning and Caution is not\
  \ in accord  with the \nadvisory circular and with aviation industry . \n4.4.9.\
  \  Many investigations into loss -of-control accidents that involved Robinson helicopters\
  \ have \nbeen concluded without a definite cause being established.  In spite of\
  \ the special training  \nthat has  been required sin ce 1995  for pilots of Robinson\
  \ helicopters , many experienced pilots \nhave lost control and  their lives . \
  \ It is possible that some of those accidents occurred because \nthe pilots involved\
  \ had not appreciated the significance of critical safety information in the \n\
  flight manuals .  Robinson's avoidance of the term Warning was likely to have dimi\
  \ nished the \nperceived importance of some critical safety information . \n4.4.10.\
  \  Therefore, the Commission is recommending that the FAA require Robinson to amend\
  \ its flight \nmanuals to include the use of \"Warning \" for those operating conditions\
  \ and practices that \ninvolve a risk of personal injury or loss of life .   \n\
  Finding:  \n4. The importance of some critical safety information in Robinson flight\
  \ manua ls was \nlikely to h ave been diminished by Robinson's use of \"Caution\
  \ \", rather than \"Warning \", \nfor operating conditions and practices that involve\
  \ a risk of personal injury or loss of \nlife. \n \n                           \
