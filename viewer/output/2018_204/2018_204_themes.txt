Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Distraction and loss of situational awareness: The skipper became distracted by simultaneously following a pod of dolphins and giving a passenger commentary, leading to a loss of situational awareness and the vessel running aground on rocks.

2. Lack of safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions when skippers were working alone in the wheelhouse.

3. Ineffective use of electronic navigation aids: The skipper and some other skippers in the operator's fleet did not routinely use the electronic navigation aids to their full effect, which could have prevented the grounding. The proper and effective use of electronic navigation aids is crucial for navigation safety.

4. Lack of defences and risk mitigation: The skipper was effectively working alone in a high-risk situation without sufficient defences in place to prevent errors that led to the grounding.

5. Lack of restrictions and risk identification: The operator had few restrictions on where the vessels could go within the Bay of Islands, which increased the likelihood of navigating close to navigational dangers. The operator had identified the risk of distraction but had only addressed it in certain situations, not foreseeing the potential for vessels to navigate close to hazards while following pods of dolphins.

6. Safety actions taken by the operator: The operator has implemented safety actions to minimize the risk of skippers becoming distracted from the core task of navigation safety.
