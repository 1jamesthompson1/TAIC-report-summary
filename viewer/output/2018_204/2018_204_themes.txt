Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Distraction and loss of situational awareness: The skipper became distracted by simultaneously following a pod of dolphins and giving a passenger commentary, leading to a loss of situational awareness and the vessel running aground on rocks.

2. Lack of safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions when skippers were working alone in the wheelhouse.

3. Ineffective use of electronic navigation aids: The skipper and some other skippers in the operator's fleet did not routinely use the electronic navigation aids to their full effect, which could have prevented the grounding. There were available features, such as geo-fencing hazards and setting depth sounder alarms, that were not utilized effectively.

4. Lack of defenses and risk mitigation: The skipper was effectively working alone in a high-risk situation without sufficient defenses in place to prevent errors that led to the grounding.

5. Actions taken by the operator: The operator has implemented safety actions to minimize the risk of distractions and improve navigation safety, such as prohibiting significant commentary while navigating and requiring a second crew member in the wheelhouse in certain cases.
