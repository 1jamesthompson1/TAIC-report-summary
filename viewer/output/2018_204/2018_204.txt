The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports shoul d be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any r ecommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The princ ipal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue ) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. During the afternoon of 27 October 2018, the restricted -limits passenger catamaran Dolphin 
Seeker  was on its second dolphin -watching tourist trip of the day in the Bay of Islands , with six 
crew and 47 passengers on board.  
1.2. The skipper had located a pod of dolphins near the Brampton Bank area and was 
manoeuvring the Dolphin Seeker  to stay with the pod, at the same time as giving a 
commentary over the public address system, when the vessel ran aground on rocks at slow 
speed.  
1.3. Nobody was injured, but the vessel sustained significant damage to both propellers and minor 
damage to its hull.  The passengers were transferred to another company vessel.  The Dolphin 
Seeker  was re -floated on the rising tide and towed back to its berth.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigatio n Commission (Commission) found  that the grounding 
occurred because the skipper did not notice  that the vessel had moved into shallow waters 
while focusing on giving a passenger commentary at the same time as manoeuvring the 
vessel to maintain proximity to  the pod of dolphins.  
1.5. The Commission also found that the skipper was effectively working alone in a high -risk 
situation . There were  few or no defences in place to prevent the one-person errors  that 
result ed in the grounding, such as fully utilising the fea tures of the vessel’s electronic 
navigation equipment.  
1.6. The Commission identified a safety issue  that the operator’s safety management system did 
not fully address the risk of vessel groundings and collisions where its skippers were  in effect 
working alone  in the wheelhouse . 
1.7. The operator took safety actions  to address this safety issue.  Therefore no new 
recommendations were required.  
1.8. A key lesson  arising from th is inquiry is that when skippers are operating vessels alone in high -
risk situations, there shou ld be adequate measures in place to minimise the risk of one -
person errors resulting in maritime accidents and incidents.

 Final Report MO -2018 -204 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 27 October  2018  the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand notified the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission that the Dolphin Seeker  had run aground in the Bay of 
Islands.  
2.2. On 27 October 2018 t he Commission opened an  inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990, and appointed an investigator in charge .  
2.3. On 28 October 2018, three investigators were deployed to the Bay of Islands  to conduct a site 
investigation .  
2.4. The investigators interviewed:  the operator ’s general manager  and operations manager, the 
vessel ’s skipper, a vessel crew member , and the operator ’s training skipper. The investigators 
also gathered evidence from the vessel  and company offices , including photographs, 
documents and electronic data.  
2.5. On 22 May 2019 the Commission approved the draft report for circulation to interested 
persons. A joint submission was received by three of the interested persons.  
2.6. On 24 July 2019 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  Fullers Bay of Islands Limited  trading as Fullers GreatSights  is a subsidiary company of 
Inter City Group (NZ) L imited. Fullers GreatSights operates 10 passenger vessels and a coach 
service , providing mainly tourist trips in and around the Bay of Islands, New Zealand.  
3.1.2.  The Dolphin Seeker  was one of the vessels operate d by Fullers GreatSights .  On the day of the 
accident  the Dolphin Seeker  was delivering one of Fullers GreatSights ’ tourism products , the 
‘Hole in the Rock Dolphin Cruise ’.  The cruise was offered twice per day , the first departing 
Paihia at 0900, and the second at 1330.  
3.1.3.  Passengers embarked at Paihia , then the vessel made the short trip to Russell to pick up 
other passengers before  beginning the  cruise through the Bay of Islands towards the Hole in 
the Rock.2  There were several tourist features along the way, where the skipper slowed the 
vessel and deliver ed commentary related to the point s of interest  (see Figure 1).  
3.1.4.  During the cruise  the crew  would keep a look -out for dolphins.  If a pod of dolphins were 
spotted , the skippe r could  deviate from the  planned  track to intercept and follow the pod , 
giving commentary over the public address system.

 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On the morning of 27 October 2018, t he Dolphin Seeker  was at its overnight berth in Ōpua 
(see Figure 2) .  The skipper and crew went on board  and prepared the vessel for the day . 
3.2.2.  At about 0 805 the Dolphin Seeker  departed its berth in Ōpua for Paihia , where it board ed 100 
passengers.  The vessel then  departed Paihia for Russell , where it boarded another 30 
passengers.   The Dolphin Seeker  then departed Russell at about 0920 for the morning ‘Hole 
in the Rock Dolphin Cruise ’.  The trip was completed without incident. During the trip the 
skipper had a radio call from another vessel , informing them  that dolphins were in the region 
of Brampton  Bank .

3.2.3.  The skipper navigated the Dolphin Seeker  to Brampton Bank , where they slowed  the vessel  to 
enable the passengers to watch dolphins at about  1105. After the  passengers  had spent 
some time dolphin watching , the Dolphin Seeker  returned to Paihia and then Russell to 
disembark passengers. The Dolphin Seeker  was alongside back in Paihia by 1250.  
3.2.4.  The reported weather during the afternoon was small waves and a gentle  breeze.  
3.2.5.  Passengers embarked in Paihia for the afternoon voyage at about 1315.   The Dolphin Seeker  
then went to Russell , where  more passengers  boarded .

3.2.6.  The Dolphin Seeker  departed Russell for its afternoon voyage at about 1346 , with 47 
passengers on  board . The skipper took the vessel directly to the area near  Brampton Bank 
where they had found the dolphins on the morning  trip (see Figure 3) .  A pod of dolphins was 
located at about 1400.  
3.2.7.  The skipper , who  was alone in the wheelhouse , slowed the vessel and b egan following the pod 
of dolphins at a low speed  of up to about 5  knots  at times .  At the same time the skipper  
began delivering the tourist commentary about the dolphins over the public address system . 
3.2.8.  Having been following the dolphins for about 15 minutes,  the Dolphin Seeker  entered an area 
of shallow water and ran aground  on rocks at low speed.  The  skipper was not able to 
manoeuvre the vessel off the rocks.  The crew made an internal  inspection of the hull s and 
found no evidence that the vessel was taking on water.  
3.2.9.  The skipper contacted Fullers GreatSights ’ management and notif ied them of the grounding.  
Because there were other company  vessels in the vicinity  and the Dolphin Seeker  appeared to 
be resting stabl y on the rocks , the skipper did not make a radio distress call.  They agreed to 
transfer the passengers to another Fullers GreatSights  vessel of a similar size to the Dolphin 
Seeker , the Te Maki . 
3.2.10.  The Te Maki  and a smaller company vessel  the Tutunui  were standing  by, ready to assist the 
Dolph in Seeker , by about 1430.  The Tutunui  was used to transfer a ll the passengers to the Te 
Maki .  The transfer operation was complete and the passengers disembarked at the wharf in 
Paihia by 1540 , one hour and 40 minutes after the vessel ran aground . There w ere no reports 
of passenger or crew injury .  
Final Report MO -2018 -204 
<< Page 7 >>
 3.2.11.  The time of the grounding was about two hours before low water.  The incoming tide lifted the 
Dolphin Seeker  off the rocks  at about 1830 , whereupon  it was towed back to its berth in 
Ōpua.  
3.2.12.  An underwater inspection revealed that t he grounding had caused minor damage to the hull s, 
but both propellers were significantly damaged.  
3.3. The Dolphin Seeker  
3.3.1.  The Dolphin Seeker  was a 23. 38-metre catamaran constructed of aluminium.  The vessel had 
been built in 2001. 
3.3.2.  The Dolphin Seeker ’s operating limit was Restricted Limits (inshore )3 in the Northland, 
Auckland and Great Barrier Island areas .  
3.3.3.  The minimum safe crewing certificate issued by Maritime New Zealand allowed the Dolphin 
Seeker  to carry up to 230 passengers . The minimum number of crew members required on  
board was dependent on how many passengers there were. One of the crew members had to  
hold an Inshore Launch Master certificate or higher , and one of the crew members had to  hold 
a Marine Engineer Class 6 certifi cate or higher. The same crew member could  hold both 
certificates.  There were six crew  members  on board during the voyage in which the vessel  
grounded .  
3.3.4.  Paper charts were carried on board .  The vessel was equipped with the following e lectronic 
navigation  and monitoring systems : 
 SIMRAD NSS12 evo2 series  incorporating  a chart plotter with AIS , depth sounder  
and r adar  
 MTU4 engine displays  
 two very-high-frequency radios  
 an EROAD5 unit  
 autopilot.  
3.4. The safety management system  
3.4.1.  Fullers GreatSights  was subject to Maritime Rule s Part  19, Maritime Transport Operator – 
Certification and Responsibilities.  Under this rule Fullers GreatSights  operated under a 
Maritime Operator Safety System . 
3.4.2.  Underpinning the safety system is an operator’s  Maritime Transport Operator Plan, which must 
be audited and approved by Maritime N ew Zealand . 
3.4.3.  Once a plan has been approved , Maritime N ew Zealand  issues the operator with a Maritime 
Transport Operator Certificate.   Each vessel in an operator’s fleet is  issued  with a certificate of 
survey by a M aritime New Zealand  authorised surveyor.  
3.4.4.  The Maritime Transport Operator Plan contained all the various policies, guidelines and 
requirements of the Dolphin Seeker . 
3.5. Navigation  
3.5.1.  The skipper was solely responsible for the Dolphin Seeker ’s navigational watch , that is to say 
the skipper was routinely alone in the wheelhouse  during the voyage. The skipper was also 
responsible for delivering the tourist commentary as necessary.   At the discretion of the

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report MO -2018 -204 skipper , other crew would occasionally deliver the tourist commentary instead of the skipper, 
usually for the purpose of training the crew .  
3.5.2.  The Dolphin Seeker ’s standing orders stated:  
LOOK -OUT Every Skipper must at all times maintain a proper look out by sight 
and hearing as well  as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing 
circumstances and conditions, so as to make full appraisal of the situation and 
the risk of collision . 
3.5.3.  The Dolphin Seeker ’s safe navigation policy stated:  
At certain times the need to provide commentary could distract the Skipper from 
the safe navigation of the vessel. At such times the commentary is to be 
suspended until conditions are such that it is safe for the commentary to resume.  
3.5.4.  The operator prohibited skippers d elivering  tourist commen tary at certain times as the risk to 
navigation was considered too high.  Those times included when its vessels transited the Hole 
in the Rock.  
3.6. Electronic navigation aids  
3.6.1.  In 2014 Maritime New Zealand  had introduced SeaCert, a new certification framework fo r 
seafarers.  As part of transitioning older qualifications to the new system Maritime New 
Zealand had run  training workshops to refresh and update the knowledge of those holding the 
older qualifications.  The workshop s had included training for electronic  navigation aids.  
3.6.2.  The skipper  had attended one of the workshop s, following which  the company had decided  to 
improve the use of electronic navigation aids  on its vessels .  Fullers GreatSights  had adopted 
a standardised electronic chart navigation system across its fleet and engaged an external 
provider to provide additional training for its skippers on its use.   The skipper of the Dolphin 
Seeker had received this additional training.  
3.6.3.  The Dolphin Se eker’s safe navigation policy stated:  
Electronic navigational aids such as GPS, Chart Plotter, Radar and AIS  [automatic 
identification system ], are to be used to assist with the safe navigation of the 
vessel; however there is to be no over reliance on thes e aids in lieu of 
maintaining a n efficient visual lookout and reference to the proper navigational 
charts for the area.  
3.7. The skipper  
3.7.1.  The s kipper had been  issued  with a Commercial L aunch  Master certificate in 1998 and a 
Marine Engineer C lass 5 certificate in 2008. Both the Commercial Launch Master and the 
Marine Engineer Class 5  certificates were  higher qualifications than those required by the 
minimum safe crewing certificate .  
3.7.2.  The skipper had started working at Fullers GreatSights  in 2000  and had been involved in all 
areas of sea -going operations.  
3.7.3.  Maritime New Zealand had issued the skipper  with a Pilotage Exemption Certificate for the 
Bay of Islands in 2011 , which the skipper  required to pilot  Fullers GreatSights ’ largest 
passenger vesse l. A Pilotage Exemption Certificate confirms  that the skipper has a thorough 
navigational knowledge of the  local area and has met the requirements for piloting vessel s 
larger than 500 gross tonnes in designated pilotage areas ; they are exempt from the 
requ irement to use  an independent marine pilot.  The Pilotage Exemption Certificate had 
expired in 2016 , and had not been renewed due to the large vessel being retired from the 
fleet.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  The Dolphin Seeker  grounded on rocks at low speed and in benign weather conditions.  
Although nobody was injured and the watertight integrity of the  vessel remained  intact, any  
grounding of a passenger vessel is of concern.  It is an indication that the safety system ha s 
not necessarily worked .  System failures increase the likelihood of repeat accidents , 
potentially with serious consequences.  
4.1.2.  There is no suggestion that mechanical or equipment failure contributed to the grounding .  It 
is very likely that the skipper became distracted by the simultaneous tasks of following the 
pod of dolphins and giving the passenger commentary over the public address system, to the 
detriment of monitoring the progress of the vessel in relation to navigation dangers.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis considers  the circumstances leading up to the grounding , and the 
safet y issue that the operator’s safety management system did not fully address the risk of 
vessel groundings and collisions where its skippers were  in effect working alone  in the 
wheelhouse . 
4.1.4.  The operator has taken a number of safety actions to address this safety issue.   Consequently, 
there was no need for the Commission to make a recommendation.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The skipper had ample experience driving the Dolphin Seeker  and was familiar with th e format 
of the trips and the general routes that were covered.  When the Dolphin Seeker  neared  the 
pod of dolphins, the skipper followed the usual routine of maintaining proximity  with but 
keeping clear of the pod to avoid disturbing the dolphins.  This t ask involved frequent 
manoeuvring of the vessel by engaging and disengaging the engines from time to time.  In 
itself the task was not onerous.  
4.2.2.  The second simultaneous task for the skipper was to give the commentary over the public 
address system, again no t in itself an onerous task.  
4.2.3.  However, the dolphins were in an area close inshore and in the shallows.  The skipper appears 
to have become fully engaged with keeping the Dolphin Seeker  close to  the pod and delivering 
the commentary, to the detriment of moni toring the vessel’s proximity to navigation hazards.  
4.2.4.  In human factors terms the skipper lost situational awareness, and did not realise that the 
vessel was navigating close to rocks  until it ran aground on them.   Once a person loses 
situational awareness t heir ability to realise th at fact diminishes with time, unless they are 
prompted by someone or by some form of alarm .  There was nobody else in the wheelhouse to 
prompt the skipper.  The potential for the electronic navigation system to have alerted the 
skipper is discussed in the following section.  
4.2.5.  The operator had identified the risk of skippers becoming distracted by giving commentary, 
but had only really identified the risk in certain situations , such as transiting the Hole in the 
Rock. The nature of the trips meant that skippers were expected to take their vessels off the 
routes between known tourist points of interest in order to fulfil a key feature of the trips, 
watching dolphins.  Within the Bay of Islands t he operator applied  few restrictions on where 
the vessels could go.  Therefore, it was foreseeable that its vessels could and would from time 
to time navigat e close to navigational dangers in order to connect with and follow pods of 
dolphins.  
4.2.6.  The operator has partially addressed this risk by prohibiting all skippers within its fleet from  
deliver ing significant commentary while navigating vessel s, thus allowing skippers to 
concentrate solely on manoeuvring their vessels and staying clear of navigational hazards and 
other vessels , and also require d a second crew member to assist in the wheelhouse in those 
cases . 

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report MO -2018 -204 4.3. Electronic navigation aids  
4.3.1.  The skipper of the Dolphin Seeker  lost situational awareness and put the vessel into shallow 
water on a collision course with the rocks . That error was not identif ied or rectified before the 
vessel grounded.  
4.3.2.  Human error is inevitable , regardless of an individual’s experience and expertise, so a primary 
aim of safety management is to put defences in place to ‘ trap’ and rectify those errors before 
they contribute  to an accident.  Electronic navigation aids can be a good way to improv e 
navigation safety.  
4.3.3.  The operator’s initiative to standardise the electronic aids on all vessels in its fleet was a 
positive action .  It meant skippers transferring between vessels w ould already be familiar with 
the navigation equipment.  
4.3.4.  The skipper was competent in using the electronic navigation aids on the Dolphin Seeker , and 
they were switched  on and available for immediate use.  However,  the skipper did not 
routinely  use them  to full effect and neither did  some  of the operator’s other skippers.  
4.3.5.  One reason for some skippers not routinely using the electronic aids was that most operations 
were tourism based and only occurred in good weather.  The skippers were fully familiar with 
the Bay of Islands area and they usually navigated visually.  Adequate r isk mitigation appeared 
to be  in place, and the Maritime  Transport Operator Plan requirement appeared to be 
satisfied,  because the electronic navigation aids were available immedi ately should they be 
required  for any reason .  
4.3.6.  However, a key component of using electronic navigation aids effectively is that the users 
must be fully current and practi sed in their use so that they can seamlessly switch back and 
forth between visual and electronic navigation.  That ability  depends on their routine and 
frequent use of the equipment , and the equipment being set up for the conditions at the time.   
4.3.7.  The Commission has raised the issue of ineffective or improper use of electronic navigation 
aids in  two other recent inquiries .6  In one case  the electronic navigation aids were not 
configured correctly for im mediate use.  In both cases the alarms were either not set or 
silenced, or were noticed by the crew and not acted on.  Although both these cases involved 
large ocean -going ships, the proper and effective use of electronic navigation aids is equally 
applicable to smaller , restricted -limit vessels.  
4.3.8.  There were at least two available features of electronic navigation equipment that could have 
been used to improve navigation  safety , and either  would likely have prevented this grounding : 
 the chart  plotter could have been used to effectively ‘geo-fence ’ hazards such as the 
rocks .  In geo-fencing, certain geographic areas are defined in the chart plotter and set 
up so  that an alarm is given  when a vessel moves into that area.  The equipment 
onboard the Dolphin Seeker could have been used to set a proximity alarm around a 
way point located  on particu lar hazards such as the reef.   Due to the repetitive nature of 
the Dolphin Seeker ’s mission , and the common equipment across the fleet,  it would be 
achievable to geo-fence most navigational hazards  within the Bay of Islands  
 the depth sounder could have  had an alarm set to alert the skipper  when the vessel 
moved into shallow  water . 
4.3.9.  Since  this grounding  the operator has require d all vessels in its fleet to set the depth sounder 
to alarm if the depth of water under th e keel reduces to a pre -set value.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The Dolphin Seeker  ran aground on rocks because the skipper became focused on giving a 
passenger commentary at the same time as manoeuvring the vessel to maintain proximity to a 
pod of dolphins, and did not notice the vessel had moved into shallow  waters.  
5.2. The skipper was effectively working alone in a high -risk situation , with little or no defences in 
place to prevent the one-person errors that result ed in the grounding.  
5.3. There were features of the various electronic navigation aids on board the Dolphin Seeker  
that, if utilised, could have prevented this grounding.  
5.4. The operator has taken a number of safety actions to minimise the risk of skippers becoming 
distracted from the core task of navigation safety.

6.1. The operator’s safety management system did not fully address the risk of vessel groundings 
and collisions where its skippers were  in effect working alone  in the wheelhouse .

 7. Safety actions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Safety action s taken by the operator post -incident are outlined below:  
 internal investigation was carried out , which included individual interviews with all 
involved and group debriefs  
 a hazard review was carried out around skippers giving commentary and maintaining a 
navigational watch  
 implemented compulsory use of depth alarms where  fitted  
 changes to policies and procedure s across the company’s  Maritime  Transport Operator 
Plan 
 management oversight of conduct out on the water has been increased with the use of 
electronic tools within the EROAD  suite of products  
 in March 201 9 Maritime New Zealand carried out a M aritime Operator Safety System  
audit . The M aritime New Zealand  auditor commented that the crew’s “reaction to 
emergency procedures was of a very good standard” .   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3. None identified .

 Final Report MO -2018 -204 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.    
8.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
8.3. No new recommendations  were  issued .

 9. Key l esson  
9.1. When skippers are operating vessels alone in high -risk situations, there should be adequate 
measures in place to minimise the risk of one -person errors resulting in maritime accidents 
and incidents.
