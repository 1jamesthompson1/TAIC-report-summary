  \ on rocks at low speed and in benign weather conditions.  \nAlthough nobody was\
  \ injured and the watertight integrity of the  vessel remained  intact, any  \n\
  grounding of a passenger vessel is of concern.  It is an indication that the safety\
  \ system ha s \nnot necessarily worked .  System failures increase the likelihood\
  \ of repeat accidents , \npotentially with serious consequences.  \n4.1.2.  There\
  \ is no suggestion that mechanical or equipment failure contributed to the grounding\
  \ .  It \nis very likely that the skipper became distracted by the simultaneous\
  \ tasks of following the \npod of dolphins and giving the passenger commentary over\
  \ the public address system, to the \ndetriment of monitoring the progress of the\
  \ vessel in relation to navigation dangers.  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis considers\
  \  the circumstances leading up to the grounding , and the \nsafet y issue that\
  \ the operator's safety management system did not fully address the risk of \nvessel\
  \ groundings and collisions where its skippers were  in effect working alone  in\
  \ the \nwheelhouse . \n4.1.4.  The operator has taken a number of safety actions\
  \ to address this safety issue.   Consequently, \nthere was no need for the Commission\
  \ to make a recommendation.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The skipper had ample\
  \ experience driving the Dolphin Seeker  and was familiar with th e format \nof\
  \ the trips and the general routes that were covered.  When the Dolphin Seeker \
  \ neared  the \npod of dolphins, the skipper followed the usual routine of maintaining\
  \ proximity  with but \nkeeping clear of the pod to avoid disturbing the dolphins.\
  \  This t ask involved frequent \nmanoeuvring of the vessel by engaging and disengaging\
  \ the engines from time to time.  In \nitself the task was not onerous.  \n4.2.2.\
  \  The second simultaneous task for the skipper was to give the commentary over\
  \ the public \naddress system, again no t in itself an onerous task.  \n4.2.3. \
  \ However, the dolphins were in an area close inshore and in the shallows.  The\
  \ skipper appears \nto have become fully engaged with keeping the Dolphin Seeker\
  \  close to  the pod and delivering \nthe commentary, to the detriment of moni toring\
  \ the vessel's proximity to navigation hazards.  \n4.2.4.  In human factors terms\
  \ the skipper lost situational awareness, and did not realise that the \nvessel\
  \ was navigating close to rocks  until it ran aground on them.   Once a person loses\
  \ \nsituational awareness t heir ability to realise th at fact diminishes with time,\
  \ unless they are \nprompted by someone or by some form of alarm .  There was nobody\
  \ else in the wheelhouse to \nprompt the skipper.  The potential for the electronic\
  \ navigation system to have alerted the \nskipper is discussed in the following\
  \ section.  \n4.2.5.  The operator had identified the risk of skippers becoming\
  \ distracted by giving commentary, \nbut had only really identified the risk in\
  \ certain situations , such as transiting the Hole in the \nRock. The nature of\
  \ the trips meant that skippers were expected to take their vessels off the \nroutes\
  \ between known tourist points of interest in order to fulfil a key feature of the\
  \ trips, \nwatching dolphins.  Within the Bay of Islands t he operator applied \
  \ few restrictions on where \nthe vessels could go.  Therefore, it was foreseeable\
  \ that its vessels could and would from time \nto time navigat e close to navigational\
  \ dangers in order to connect with and follow pods of \ndolphins.  \n4.2.6.  The\
  \ operator has partially addressed this risk by prohibiting all skippers within\
  \ its fleet from  \ndeliver ing significant commentary while navigating vessel s,\
  \ thus allowing skippers to \nconcentrate solely on manoeuvring their vessels and\
  \ staying clear of navigational hazards and \nother vessels , and also require d\
  \ a second crew member to assist in the wheelhouse in those \ncases . \n\n<< Page\

  \ The skipper of the Dolphin Seeker  lost situational awareness and put the vessel\
  \ into shallow \nwater on a collision course with the rocks . That error was not\
  \ identif ied or rectified before the \nvessel grounded.  \n4.3.2.  Human error\
  \ is inevitable , regardless of an individual's experience and expertise, so a primary\
  \ \naim of safety management is to put defences in place to ' trap' and rectify\
  \ those errors before \nthey contribute  to an accident.  Electronic navigation\
  \ aids can be a good way to improv e \nnavigation safety.  \n4.3.3.  The operator's\
  \ initiative to standardise the electronic aids on all vessels in its fleet was\
  \ a \npositive action .  It meant skippers transferring between vessels w ould already\
  \ be familiar with \nthe navigation equipment.  \n4.3.4.  The skipper was competent\
  \ in using the electronic navigation aids on the Dolphin Seeker , and \nthey were\
  \ switched  on and available for immediate use.  However,  the skipper did not \n\
  routinely  use them  to full effect and neither did  some  of the operator's other\
  \ skippers.  \n4.3.5.  One reason for some skippers not routinely using the electronic\
  \ aids was that most operations \nwere tourism based and only occurred in good weather.\
  \  The skippers were fully familiar with \nthe Bay of Islands area and they usually\
  \ navigated visually.  Adequate r isk mitigation appeared \nto be  in place, and\
  \ the Maritime  Transport Operator Plan requirement appeared to be \nsatisfied,\
  \  because the electronic navigation aids were available immedi ately should they\
  \ be \nrequired  for any reason .  \n4.3.6.  However, a key component of using electronic\
  \ navigation aids effectively is that the users \nmust be fully current and practi\
  \ sed in their use so that they can seamlessly switch back and \nforth between visual\
  \ and electronic navigation.  That ability  depends on their routine and \nfrequent\
  \ use of the equipment , and the equipment being set up for the conditions at the\
  \ time.   \n4.3.7.  The Commission has raised the issue of ineffective or improper\
  \ use of electronic navigation \naids in  two other recent inquiries .6  In one\
  \ case  the electronic navigation aids were not \nconfigured correctly for im mediate\
  \ use.  In both cases the alarms were either not set or \nsilenced, or were noticed\
  \ by the crew and not acted on.  Although both these cases involved \nlarge ocean\
  \ -going ships, the proper and effective use of electronic navigation aids is equally\
  \ \napplicable to smaller , restricted -limit vessels.  \n4.3.8.  There were at\
  \ least two available features of electronic navigation equipment that could have\
  \ \nbeen used to improve navigation  safety , and either  would likely have prevented\
  \ this grounding : \n\uF0B7 the chart  plotter could have been used to effectively\
  \ 'geo-fence ' hazards such as the \nrocks .  In geo-fencing, certain geographic\
  \ areas are defined in the chart plotter and set \nup so  that an alarm is given\
  \  when a vessel moves into that area.  The equipment \nonboard the Dolphin Seeker\
  \ could have been used to set a proximity alarm around a \nway point located  on\
  \ particu lar hazards such as the reef.   Due to the repetitive nature of \nthe\
  \ Dolphin Seeker 's mission , and the common equipment across the fleet,  it would\
  \ be \nachievable to geo-fence most navigational hazards  within the Bay of Islands\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the depth sounder could have  had an alarm set to alert the skipper\
  \  when the vessel \nmoved into shallow  water . \n4.3.9.  Since  this grounding\
  \  the operator has require d all vessels in its fleet to set the depth sounder\
  \ \nto alarm if the depth of water under th e keel reduces to a pre -set value.\
