  \ The jet boat Discovery 2  was operating on the Shotover River with nine passengers\
  \ on  \nboard when it made contact  with a rock face in Skippers Canyon , resulting\
  \ in a serious \ninjury to one passenger and minor injuries to the remainder.  The\
  \ boat suffered \nmode rate damage to the bow area.   \n3.2. Jet boating is a high-risk\
  \ activity that leaves very little margin for error when navigating \nat high speed\
  \ in narrow channels and rivers.  The consequence of an accident can be \ncatastrophic\
  \ when passengers are being carried.  It therefore  is essential that safety \n\
  systems are in place and being followed to help reduce the risk of an accident occurring.\
  \  \n3.3. The Discovery 2  was travelling at high speed through a section of the\
  \ river in the canyon \nwhen a  mechanical failure within the jet unit steering\
  \ system caused a loss of control .  \nThis resulted in the bow of the boat making\
  \  heavy contact  with the canyon wall .  The \nCommission found that the actions\
  \ of the jet boat  driver were not contributory.  \n3.4. The following analysis\
  \ examines  the mec hanical failure that caused the loss of control .  It \nalso\
  \ considers the maintenance system that allowed the mechanical failure  to occur\
  \ , and \nthe operator's hazard identification  and mitigation  system .    \nLoss\
  \ of control  \n3.5. The jet boat  driver lost control of the Discovery 2  because\
  \ the stud-bolts  fastening the \nsteering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the\
  \ jet  unit broke and rendered the steering \nnozzle  and reverse bucket ineffective\
  \  (see Figure 12). As a result t he boat lost steerage \nand could not be stoppe\
  \ d before it hit the canyon wall.  \n3.6. As discussed in section 2, the integrity\
  \ of the bolted joint is dependent the stud -bolt \nbeing protected from experiencing\
  \ cyclic loading by generating enough pre -tension \nwithin it . The pre -tension\
  \ in the stud -bolt is achieved  by tightening the nut with the \nrequired amount\
  \ of torque. If the pre -tension is inadequate , the stud -bolt will experience\
  \ \nfatigue.  \n3.7. The failure analysis conducted on the broken stud -bolts found\
  \ they had failed due to \nfatigue cracking. A close exami nation of the fracture\
  \ faces (Figure 13) showed  that the \nfatigue cracking was consistent with low\
  \ pre -tension in the stud -bolt.  \n3.8. The failure analysis report concluded\
  \ that the stud -bolts had fractured due to fatigue \ncracking caused by insufficient\
  \ torque being applied to the nuts and therefore \ninadequate pre -tension in the\
  \ stud -bolts.   \n3.9. The jet unit tailpipe and steering nozzle, including stud-bolts,\
  \ washers and nuts , were all \npart of the HJ212 jet unit model .  The manual for\
  \ the HJ212 jet unit assembly contained \nprescriptive specifications , including\
  \ the required torque for the various nuts and bolts \nfitted to  the jet unit.\
  \  \n \n \nFinal Report MO -2019 -201 \n<< Page 19 >>\n Maintenance  \nSafety issue:\
  \ the operator's planned maintenance programme did not ensure that the \nmanufacturers'\
  \ spe cifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system  \n3.10.\
  \ The operator  was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82 : Commercial\
  \ Jet \nBoat Operations - River. Part 82  stated  that \"a commercial jet boat \
  \ operator must have, \nand apply, a maintenance programme for every jet boat  and\
  \ propulsion unit\". \n3.11. The maintenance programme applied by the operator \
  \ included maintenance checks an d \nassurances that were prescribed  based on the\
  \ boat operating hours. For exampl e, every \n50 hours recorded on the engine would\
  \ trigger the '50-hour' maintenance check, which \nwas guided by the '50-hour checklist'\
  \  (Appendix 1) . The 50-hour  checklist included a \nsection of items to check\
  \ on the HJ212 jet unit ( shown in Figure 9).  \n3.12. In acco rdance with the operator's\
  \ checklist , a torque wrench should have been  used to \ncheck the tension on the\
  \  bolts  which fasten  the revers e bucket , and the cotter pins .  A \ntorque\
  \ wrench was not used to check other  nuts in the  jet unit assembly, including\
  \ the \nstud-bolts that broke.  The Commission was unable  to establish when the\
  \ torque  on the \nbroken stud-bolts had last been checked .  \n3.13. The stud -bolts\
  \ fasten ing the steering nozzle to the tailpipe were size M814.  The torque \n\
  specified in the HJ212 manual  for the M8 stud-bolts used on the jet unit was 12Nm\
  \  \n(Newton metres ).  M8 nuts and bolts were  used in various applications throughout\
  \ the \nboat.  However,  they were not subjected to tightening using a torque wrench\
  \ as they \nwere  generally considered to be 'hand -tight' , an approach  that the\
  \ Commission found \nfrom interviews was not un common across the industry .  \n\
  3.14. A recommendation would have been made to Skippers Canyon Jet Limited to ensure\
  \ \nthat its maintenance system complied with all manufacturers ' instructions and\
  \ guidanc e.  \nHowever , since the accident the company has taken action to improve\
  \ its Safe Operating \nPlan to ensure that all jet unit components are maintained\
  \ to manufacturers ' \nspecifications, which  includes checking the torque on all\
  \ nuts and bolts.   \nHazard identification  \nSafety issue: the operator's hazard\
  \ identification system had not identified the risk that a system \ncritical to\
  \ the safety of the jet boat could fail  \n3.15. Maritime Rules Part 82 , Section\
  \ 1.20 - Managing Ha zards (see Appendix 2) lays down  the \nrequirements for an\
  \ operator 's hazard  management  system . It states , in part, that:  \nA commercial\
  \ jet boat  operator must meet its health and safety \nresponsibilities under the\
  \ Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, by \nincluding, without being limited\
  \ to, the following:  \n(a) the process used by the operator to identify the operational\
  \ hazards \nthat may cause harm t o a person; and  \n(b) the process used by the\
  \ operator to review operational hazards and \nhow they are to be controlled, including\
  \ how drivers are made aware \n                                                \
  \        \n14 A bolt that has a diameter of eight millimetres.  \n \n\n<< Page 20\
  \ >>\n Final Report MO -2019 -201 of new hazards before drivers and passengers are\
  \ exposed to them \n(for example, the day -to-day changes in river conditions);\
  \ and \u2026  \n3.16. Section 1.20 of Part 82 primarily refers to hazards in the\
  \ context they can be identified or \ncontrolled by jet boat  drivers .  That is\
  \ to say , the hazards relate d to operating conditions \nfaced by the jet boat\
  \  driver on the day of op eration.   \n3.17. The hazards identified by the operator\
  \ in the Hazard Register (Appendix 3) reflected the \ncontext of Section 1.20 .\
  \  Generally  they related to river conditions and the driver s' \nperformance .\
  \ For example , identified hazards include d, but were  not limited to , high and\
  \ \nlow water, ice, other river users  and driver fatigue  and training . \n3.18.\
  \ The history of  commercial  jet boating accidents in New Zealand , especially\
  \ the nature of \nthose accidents in the late 1990s,  resulted in a regulatory focus\
  \ on jet b oat operating \nconditions and driver performance and training . \n3.19.\
  \ However, this accident demonstrates that the safety of a jet boat and its crew\
  \  and \npassengers is also subject to significant hazards and risks not related\
  \ to operating  \nconditions or driver  performance .    \n3.20. The operator's\
  \ maintenance programme explicitly recognised that certain components \nwere critical\
  \ to the safe operation of the boat. This can be seen in the 50-hour checklist \n\
  prompt  that required a  check  of the torque o f specified  component s. Also included\
  \ in \nthe maintenance program me was a Critical Parts Log, which listed  the parts\
  \ to be \nreplaced at certain operating -hour -based milestones. Six of the 13 critical\
  \ parts related \nto the steering and control of the boat. \n3.21. The proximate\
  \ cause of t his accident was a loss of steering and control due to a \nmechanical\
  \ failure  of the jet unit . Individual steering and control components were \n\
  identified for increased scrutiny in the maintenance system, indicating that the\
  \ steering \nand control system had be en recognised as critical to the saf e operation\
  \ of the boat.  \nUnfortunately,  the mechanical failure of the steering  and control\
  \  system had not been \nidentified as a hazard  and therefore specific risk mitigation\
  \ in the case of such an event \nwas absent .  \nRisk  control  \n3.22. There are\
  \ two categories of risk control : preventive risk control and recovery risk control.\
  \   \n3.23. Preventive risk control s are put in place to prevent a negative consequence.\
  \ For example , \nthe operator had identified that  ice in the river could cause\
  \  a loss of power through the \njet unit. The preventive risk control s put in\
  \ place included checking the river for ice bu ild-\nup, suspending  commercial\
  \ trips , and checking the jet unit intake before and after each \ntrip.    \n3.24.\
  \ Recovery risk control s minimise the negative consequences of a realised hazard.\
  \ \nAdventure tourism j et boat ing is a high-speed  activity , often being undertaken\
  \ in \nconfined rivers  with passengers  on board .  There is a  very narrow margin\
  \ of error , little \nscope for recovery when something goes w rong, and high consequence\
  \ s in the event of \nfailure.  Recovery risk control s include jet boat  driver\
  \ training in respect of accidents and \nemergencies , and the operator 's emergency\
  \ response system .  \n3.25. In this accident , the actions of the jet boat  driver\
  \ and the operator 's response  to the \naccident were  both efficient and effective\
  \ , providing timely and appropriate aid to the \ndriver and passengers.  \n \n\
  Final Report MO -2019 -201 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 3.26. The safe operation of jet boat\
  \ s is heavily dependent on preventive risk control s, \nparticularly driver training\
  \ and  the active analysis of river conditions. However, as noted \nabove, the safety\
  \ of a jet boat  is subject to hazards and risks that are not related to \noperational\
  \ conditions or driver  training . \n3.27. Had mechanical failure of the steering\
  \ and control sy stem been  identified as a hazard, \nthe preventive risk control\
  \ s may have led to increased scrutiny of the entire  system , \nparticularly critical\
  \  parts relevant to the  syste m.  \n3.28. Although Part 82 does  require  an operator\
  \ to carry out  hazard identification and \nmitigation  its context does not specifically\
  \ prompt hazard identification of maintenance \nand safety critical systems .  \n\
  3.29. This accident was due to the mechanical failure of a system crucial to the\
  \ safe operation \nof the boat. Hence t he essential lesson of recommendation 104/99\
  \ remains pertinent , \nand therefore t he Commission has made a  recommendation\
  \ to the Director of Maritime \nNew Zealand that is applicable to Part 82 . \nOther\
  \ potential safety factors considered  \nLiquid sealant  and n ozzle insert proud\
  \ of bearing face contributing to fatigue of the stud-\nbolts \n3.30. As described\
  \ in section 2, using a nut and bolt to clamp two components together is \ndependent\
  \ on the two c omponents bearing the compressive force imparted by the pre -\ntension\
  \ in th e bolt. This requires that the contact area between the two faces be \n\
  maximised  and incompressible , and the load transfer be uniform. The bearing should\
  \ \ncover the entire bearing surface and not simply one small protrusion . \n3.31.\
  \ The nozzle assembly described in section 2 included an insert into the nozzle.\
  \ The failure \nanalysis found that the insert was not fitting flush with the bearing\
  \ face of the nozzle \nhousing and was proud by up to 0.23  millimetres .  The clamping\
  \ arrangement between \nthe steering nozzle and the tailpipe  was therefore not\
  \ optimal and may have contributed \nto fatigue in the stud -bolts.  \n3.32. The\
  \ manufacturers specifications for the HJ212 did not include a sealant  being applied\
  \  \nbetween the steering nozzle assembly and the  tailpipe, but a liquid sealant\
  \  had been \napplied within the joint.  \n3.33. The nozzle assembly had been  installed\
  \ on the Discovery 2  in 2016 and had accumulated \nin excess of about 800 hours\
  \ of cyclic loading before the stud-bolts broke.  The \nengineering failure analysis\
  \ found that the stud-bolts broke after about 200  hours of \noperation . Although\
  \ possible, it seems unlikely  that the sub-optimal  bearing surfaces  and \nliquid\
  \ sealant  contributed to the stud-bolts' fatigue failure.  \nSurvivabilit y of\
  \ the boat  \n3.34. A significant recovery risk control available to jet boat  operators\
  \ is the survivability of the \nboats. Survivability is the capability of a boat\
  \ to continue its mission and minimise injury \nto its occupants in the event of\
  \ an accident or failure of some kind.  \n3.35. The injuries sustained in this accident\
  \  were due to passengers being thrown forward \nfrom their seats when the boat\
  \ struck  the canyon wall. T he injuries included a broken leg \nfor a passenger\
  \ who was partially ejected from the boat . Other passengers had bruising  \nand\
  \ minor lacerations.  \n \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report MO -2019 -201 3.36. Because\
  \ the injuries were due to the occupants of the boat being thrown forward, one \n\
  risk control would have be en to install seatbelts  to restrain them.  The jet boat\
  \  industry \nhad considered th e use of seatbelts, and in one case even trialled\
  \ them. However,  \nseatbelts were found to increase the risk to passenger safety\
  \ in the event that passengers \nbecame trapped in a  high-sided boat, it rolled\
  \  over or it was subjected to a stern wave . \n3.37. The risk of being ejected\
  \ from a boat is addressed in Maritime Rules Part 82, which  \nrequires that a boat's\
  \ side deck be a certain height above the seat. The Discovery 2  \ncomplied with\
  \ that requirement, which likely prevented one passenger being completely \nejected\
  \ from the boat into the water.  \n3.38. Other recovery risk control s laid out\
  \ in Part 82 are handholds for passengers, padding to \ncushion contact between\
  \ them and the boat, and no \"projections and sharp edges\" that \ncould harm passengers\
  \ .  The Discovery 2  was free of projections and sharp edges. \nHowever,  it is\
  \ likely that  some injuries were aggravated when passengers were thrown \ninto\
  \ the unpadded seat back s in front of them,  as shown in Figure 14.  \n3.39. Although\
  \ the Discovery 2  had been  built in about 2000 and Part 82 had not been \nintroduced\
  \ until 2012, the boat had current certification, which  found it compl ied with\
  \ \nthe rules.  However, while the Maritime Rules provide a minimum safe standard,\
  \ \noperators  are still responsible for identifying and mitigating risks and hazards\
  \ specific to \ntheir own operation s and should endeavour to  use that process\
  \ to  improv e their safety \nstandards over and above the minimum  required . \
