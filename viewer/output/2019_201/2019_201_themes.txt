Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Mechanical failure: The accident was caused by a mechanical failure in the jet unit steering system, specifically the breaking of stud-bolts that rendered the steering nozzle and reverse bucket ineffective. The failure was due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient pre-tension in the stud-bolts.

2. Maintenance system failure: The operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the manufacturers' specifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system. The torque on the stud-bolts had not been checked, and other nuts in the jet unit assembly were not tightened using a torque wrench.

3. Hazard identification failure: The operator's hazard identification system did not identify the risk that a system critical to the safety of the jet boat could fail. The hazards identified primarily related to operating conditions and driver performance, but not to maintenance and safety critical systems.

4. Lack of risk control measures: The accident highlighted the absence of specific risk mitigation measures for the mechanical failure of the steering and control system. The report suggests that if the failure had been identified as a hazard, preventive risk controls could have been implemented to increase scrutiny of the system.

5. Survivability of the boat: The injuries sustained in the accident were due to passengers being thrown forward from their seats when the boat struck the canyon wall. The report mentions the consideration of seatbelts, but they were found to increase the risk to passenger safety in certain scenarios. The boat complied with the height requirement for side decks, but injuries were aggravated by the lack of padding on seat backs.

6. Compliance with minimum safety standards: While the boat had current certification and complied with the minimum safety standards, operators are still responsible for identifying and mitigating risks and hazards specific to their own operations. The report emphasizes the need for operators to go beyond the minimum requirements to improve safety standards.
