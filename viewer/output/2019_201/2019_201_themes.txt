Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Mechanical failure: The accident was caused by a mechanical failure in the jet unit steering system, specifically the breaking of stud-bolts that rendered the steering nozzle and reverse bucket ineffective. The failure was due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient pre-tension in the stud-bolts.

2. Maintenance system failure: The operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the maintenance of crucial systems, such as the steering and control system, was carried out in accordance with manufacturers' specifications. The torque on the stud-bolts was not checked using a torque wrench as required.

3. Hazard identification failure: The operator's hazard identification system did not identify the risk that a system critical to the safety of the jet boat could fail. The focus was primarily on hazards related to operating conditions and driver performance, rather than mechanical failures.

4. Lack of risk mitigation measures: Due to the failure to identify the mechanical failure as a hazard, there were no specific risk mitigation measures in place when the jet unit failed. This highlights the importance of having preventive risk control measures in place.

5. Survivability of the boat: The injuries sustained in the accident were due to passengers being thrown forward from their seats when the boat struck the canyon wall. The lack of seatbelts and unpadded seat backs aggravated the injuries. The report mentions the consideration of seatbelts by the industry, but the increased risk of passengers becoming trapped in certain situations led to their exclusion.

6. Recovery risk control: The actions of the jet boat driver and the operator's response to the accident were efficient and effective in providing timely and appropriate aid to the driver and passengers. This highlights the importance of having recovery risk control measures, such as driver training and emergency response systems, in place.
