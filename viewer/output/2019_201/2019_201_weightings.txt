The report does not discuss the state of alertness or work hours of the individuals involved, such as the jet boat driver or maintenance personnel (3.1-3.39).
","0.0","0.0","The report specifically states that ""the actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory"" to the accident (3.3, 4.1). There is no indication that human error or assumptions played a role in the incident.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not indicate that a lack of training or competency among the personnel was a factor in the accident. The focus is on mechanical failure and maintenance issues rather than on the skills or instruction of the individuals involved (3.1-3.39).
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the report to suggest that a lack of training or familiarity with the equipment contributed to the accident. The mechanical failure was due to maintenance issues, not operator unfamiliarity (3.1-3.39).
","0.0","0.0","Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in the accident, as the report does not discuss issues related to teamwork, communication, or leadership skills in the context of the incident (3.1-3.39).
","0.0","23.333","The report identifies a lack of adherence to safety procedures, specifically the failure to use a torque wrench to tighten the nuts on the stud-bolts to the specified value recommended by the manufacturer (4.4). This lack of adherence to the maintenance procedures contributed to the mechanical failure that led to the accident.
","5.774","20.0","The operator's maintenance system did not ensure that maintenance was carried out in accordance with manufacturers' specifications (4.5). Additionally, the operator's hazard identification and mitigation system failed to recognize the risk of propulsion and steering system failure (4.6). These issues suggest a lack of a strong safety culture within the organization.
","0.0","23.333","The operator's hazard identification system did not identify the risk of a critical system failure, and there were no risk mitigation measures in place for the jet unit failure (4.6). This indicates a deficiency in risk management and analysis.
","5.774","10.0","While the report does not directly criticize regulatory oversight, it does mention that the operator was subject to Maritime Rules and that the boat had current certification (3.39). However, the accident demonstrates that compliance with minimum standards was not sufficient to prevent the accident, suggesting a need for improved regulatory oversight and compliance.
","0.0","0.0","The accident was not caused by a lack of situational awareness. The mechanical failure was due to maintenance issues, not the driver's perception or understanding of the environment (3.1-3.39).
","0.0","0.0","The report commends the actions of the jet boat driver and the operator's response to the accident as both efficient and effective (3.25). Therefore, emergency response preparedness was not a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","23.333","The mechanical failure was directly attributed to inadequate maintenance and inspection regimes. The stud-bolts failed due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient pre-tension, which was a result of not using a torque wrench during routine maintenance (4.3, 4.4). The operator's maintenance program did not ensure that critical maintenance was carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications (4.5).
