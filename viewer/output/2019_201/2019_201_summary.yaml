- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of fatigue or alertness issues contributing to the accident. The report specifically states that "the actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory" to the accident (3.3, 4.1).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The accident was not attributed to a lack of situational awareness. The report indicates a mechanical failure was the cause, not the driver's perception or understanding of the environment (3.3, 4.2).
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence in the report suggesting that distracted operation played a role in the accident. The driver's actions were found to be non-contributory (3.3, 4.1).
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report does not indicate that human error, in terms of the driver's actions, was a factor in the accident. The mechanical failure was due to maintenance issues, not operational errors (3.3, 4.4).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The operator's maintenance system did not ensure adherence to manufacturers' specifications, indicating a potential issue with safety culture and organizational influences on maintenance practices (4.5). Additionally, the operator's hazard identification system failed to recognize the risk of propulsion and steering system failure (4.6).
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication that communication or crew resource management were factors in the accident. The report focuses on mechanical failure and maintenance practices (3.3-3.9).
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report does not discuss the role of training and preparedness for emergency procedures in the context of the accident's cause. It does mention effective actions post-accident (3.25).
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Emergency response was not a contributing factor to the accident, although the report notes that the response to the accident was efficient and effective (3.25).
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 50
  explanation: 'The accident was directly caused by a mechanical failure due to inadequate maintenance, specifically the failure to apply the correct torque to the stud-bolts as per the manufacturer''s specifications (3.5-3.8, 4.4, 4.5).

    '
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Fire detection and suppression were not related to the accident, as there was no fire involved (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: 'The operator''s failure to comply with maintenance regulations and the lack of a comprehensive safety management system that identified the risk of mechanical failure contributed to the accident (3.10-3.12, 3.20-3.21, 4.5, 4.6).

    '
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: While there were issues with the equipment's maintenance, the design and specifications of the equipment itself were not cited as contributing factors to the accident (3.9, 3.13).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The operator's hazard identification system did not identify the risk of propulsion and steering system failure, but this is more directly related to safety management rather than the broader concept of risk assessment and management (4.6).
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather was not a factor in the accident, as the report focuses on mechanical failure and maintenance issues (Insufficient information).

    '
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Although the stud-bolts failed due to fatigue, this is more directly related to maintenance procedures and compliance rather than the broader theme of structural integrity and material fatigue (3.7, 3.8).
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the report that contributed to the accident. The report clearly attributes the cause to maintenance issues and the lack of proper hazard identification and mitigation (3.3-3.9, 4.4-4.6).
