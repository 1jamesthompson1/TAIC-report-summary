- name: Mechanical Failure
  explanation: Mechanical failure is a safety theme that refers to the malfunction or breakdown of mechanical systems, which can lead to loss of control or other hazardous situations. In the case of the Discovery 2 accident, the mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control, resulting in the boat making heavy contact with the canyon wall ("a mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control" (3.3)). The stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit broke due to fatigue cracking, which was a direct cause of the accident ("The stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit failed due to fatigue cracking" (4.3)). This theme is relevant because the mechanical integrity of the boat's steering system was critical to its safe operation, and its failure was the proximate cause of the accident.
- name: Maintenance Procedures
  explanation: Maintenance procedures encompass the processes and standards used to ensure that equipment is kept in good working order and operates safely. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications ("The operator's maintenance system did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications" (4.5)). Specifically, a torque wrench was not used during routine maintenance to tighten the nuts on the stud-bolts to the specified value recommended by the manufacturer of the jet unit, leading to insufficient pre-tension and eventual failure ("Insufficient pre-tension on the stud-bolts resulted because a torque wrench was not used during routine maintenance to tighten the nuts on the stud-bolts to the specified value recommended by the manufacturer of the jet unit" (4.4)).
- name: Hazard Identification and Risk Mitigation
  explanation: Hazard identification and risk mitigation involve recognizing potential sources of danger and implementing measures to prevent accidents or minimize their impact. This safety theme is particularly relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's hazard identification and mitigation system had not identified that the failure of the propulsion and steering system was a risk to the safety of the jet boat operation ("The operator's hazard identification and mitigation system had not identified that the failure of the propulsion and steering system was a risk to the safety of the jet boat operation" (4.6)). As a result, there were no risk mitigation measures in place when the jet unit failed, which contributed to the severity of the accident.
- name: Regulatory Compliance
  explanation: 'Regulatory compliance refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, and guidelines that govern operations. In the context of the Discovery 2 accident, the operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82, which mandated a maintenance program for every jet boat and propulsion unit ("The operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82: Commercial Jet Boat Operations - River" (3.10)). However, the operator''s maintenance program did not fully comply with these rules, as it failed to ensure that the jet unit''s components were maintained to the manufacturer''s specifications, highlighting a gap in regulatory compliance.'
- name: Operator Training and Performance
  explanation: Operator training and performance are critical to ensuring that personnel are capable of safely managing equipment and responding to emergencies. While the actions of the jet boat driver in the Discovery 2 accident were not contributory ("The actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory to the accident" (4.1)), the theme is still relevant as it underscores the importance of having well-trained operators who can effectively manage unforeseen mechanical failures or other emergencies. The driver's ability to respond efficiently and effectively after the accident was a positive aspect of the operator's training and performance ("In this accident, the actions of the jet boat driver and the operator's response to the accident were both efficient and effective" (3.25)).
- name: Equipment Design and Survivability
  explanation: Equipment design and survivability pertain to the inherent safety features of equipment and its ability to protect occupants in the event of an accident. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident as the survivability of the boat was a significant recovery risk control available to jet boat operators ("A significant recovery risk control available to jet boat operators is the survivability of the boats" (3.34)). The design of the Discovery 2, including compliance with requirements for side deck height and the absence of projections and sharp edges, likely prevented more severe injuries or ejections from the boat during the accident ("The Discovery 2 complied with that requirement, which likely prevented one passenger being completely ejected from the boat into the water" (3.37)). However, the lack of padded seat backs may have aggravated some injuries, indicating that design improvements could enhance survivability ("However, it is likely that some injuries were aggravated when passengers were thrown into the unpadded seat backs in front of them" (3.38)).
