- name: Mechanical Failure
  explanation: Mechanical failure is a safety theme that involves the malfunction or breakdown of mechanical systems, which can lead to loss of control or other hazardous situations. In the case of the Discovery 2 accident, the mechanical failure within the jet unit steering system caused a loss of control, resulting in the boat making "heavy contact with the canyon wall" (3.3). The specific mechanical failure was due to the stud-bolts fastening the steering nozzle assembly to the tailpipe of the jet unit breaking, which rendered the steering nozzle and reverse bucket ineffective (3.5). This theme is relevant because the mechanical integrity of the boat's steering system was directly responsible for the accident.
- name: Maintenance Procedures
  explanation: Maintenance procedures are a safety theme that encompasses the processes and standards used to keep equipment in proper working order. This theme is relevant to the accident because the operator's maintenance program did not ensure that the maintenance of systems crucial to the safe operation of the boat were carried out in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications (4.5). The failure analysis concluded that the stud-bolts had fractured due to fatigue cracking caused by insufficient torque being applied to the nuts, indicating inadequate maintenance procedures (3.8). The operator's maintenance checks did not include the use of a torque wrench for the stud-bolts that broke, which was a contributing factor to the accident (3.12).
- name: Hazard Identification and Mitigation
  explanation: Hazard identification and mitigation is a safety theme that involves recognizing potential risks and implementing measures to prevent accidents or minimize their impact. This theme is relevant to the Discovery 2 accident because the operator's hazard identification system had not identified the risk that a system critical to the safety of the jet boat could fail (3.15-3.21). The operator's maintenance program recognized certain components as critical to safe operation, but the mechanical failure of the steering and control system had not been identified as a hazard, and specific risk mitigation for such an event was absent (3.21). This lack of hazard identification and mitigation contributed to the accident.
- name: Regulatory Compliance
  explanation: Regulatory compliance is a safety theme that involves adhering to rules and regulations designed to ensure safety. This theme is relevant because the operator was subject to the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 82, which stated that "a commercial jet boat operator must have, and apply, a maintenance programme for every jet boat and propulsion unit" (3.10). However, the operator's maintenance programme did not ensure that the manufacturers' specifications were met for the jet boat's steering and control system (3.10). The accident highlighted the need for operators to not only comply with regulations but also to exceed minimum standards when necessary to ensure safety (3.39).
- name: Training and Performance
  explanation: Training and performance is a safety theme that focuses on the skills and actions of personnel, such as operators and maintenance staff, to prevent accidents and respond effectively when they occur. While the actions of the jet boat driver were not contributory to the accident (4.1), the maintenance staff's performance in applying the correct torque to the stud-bolts was inadequate (3.8). The operator's maintenance system did not ensure that maintenance was carried out to manufacturers' specifications, which is indicative of a training or performance shortfall (4.5). Proper training and performance standards are crucial for maintaining safety-critical systems.
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  explanation: Equipment design and specifications are a safety theme that pertains to the technical aspects of equipment that ensure its safe operation. This theme is relevant to the accident because the stud-bolts, washers, and nuts were all part of the HJ212 jet unit model, and the manual for this model contained prescriptive specifications, including the required torque for various nuts and bolts fitted to the jet unit (3.9). The accident occurred due to a deviation from these specifications, highlighting the importance of adhering to equipment design and specifications for safety.
