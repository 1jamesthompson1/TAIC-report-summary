- name: Communication Breakdown
  explanation: Communication breakdown is a critical safety theme in this accident, as there was no effective means for the train attendant, who was operating the mobility hoist, to communicate with the train manager. This lack of communication contributed to the premature departure of the train with passengers still on the mobility hoist. The report states, "there was no means provided for the train attendant in the luggage van to communicate with the train manager near the front of the train" (4.2) and "there was no effective means for the train attendant who was operating the mobility hoist to communicate with the train manager" (5.1). This theme is relevant because effective communication is essential to ensure that all safety checks are completed before a train departs.
- name: Procedural Non-Compliance
  explanation: Procedural non-compliance is another safety theme, as the operation of the mobility hoist was not included in the train manager's pre-departure checks, nor was it written into the departure procedure. The report highlights that "the stowing of the mobility hoist and securing of the luggage van doors did not feature in the train manager's pre-departure checks" (4.2) and "the operation of the mobility hoist had not been written into the departure procedure being followed by the train manager" (5.1). This theme is relevant because adherence to comprehensive procedures is crucial for the safe operation of trains, especially when dealing with passengers requiring special assistance.
- name: Reliance on Human Memory
  explanation: Reliance on human memory is a significant safety theme, as the train manager was expected to remember the stations where passengers in wheelchairs were to alight and to communicate effectively with the train attendant. The report indicates that "the operation of the mobility hoist relied on the train manager knowing and/or remembering the stations at which any passengers in wheelchairs were to alight" (4.4) and acknowledges that "human memory can be influenced by a number of factors" (4.6). This theme is relevant because relying solely on human memory for critical safety tasks is unreliable and can lead to errors.
- name: Visibility Issues
  explanation: Visibility issues played a role in this accident, as the train manager could not easily see whether the mobility hoist was in use due to environmental conditions and the lack of high-visibility markings on the hoist. The report notes, "it would have been difficult for the train manager to see the mobility hoist even if it had been deployed onto the platform" (4.7) and "even if it had been deployed, it might not have been visible to the train manager due to the distance, the low ambient light conditions and the lack of high-visibility marking on the hoist" (5.2). This theme is relevant because the ability to visually confirm the status of equipment is essential for safe operations.
- name: Inadequate Safety Systems
  explanation: Inadequate safety systems are a theme, as the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system, which allowed the train manager to receive a green all-doors-closed signal despite the mobility hoist being deployed. The report states, "the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system" (4.2) and "the status of the luggage van doors was not interlocked with the train door status and control system" (5.1). This theme is relevant because the integration of safety systems is necessary to prevent human error and ensure all parts of the train are secure before departure.
- name: Lack of Procedures for Special Equipment
  explanation: The lack of procedures for the operation of special equipment, such as the mobility hoist, is a safety theme because KiwiRail did not have a procedure to cover its operation after the instructions had been removed from the Rail Operating Code. The report reveals, "KiwiRail did not have a procedure to cover the operation of the mobility hoist" (4.3). This theme is relevant because having clear, written procedures for the use of all equipment, especially those required for passengers with disabilities, is fundamental to ensuring safety and preventing accidents.
