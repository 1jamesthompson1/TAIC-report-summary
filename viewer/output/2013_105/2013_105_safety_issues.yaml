- safety_issue: 'The main safety issue arising from this incident was that procedurally there was a disconnect between the operation of the mobility hoist from the luggage van at the rear of the train and the train manager''s pre-departure checks near the front of the train: the stowing of the mobility hoist and securing of the luggage van doors did not feature in the train manager''s pre-departure checks; there was no means provided for the train attendant in the luggage van to communicate with the train manager near the front of the train; the luggage van doors were not electronically connected to the train door status and control system.

- safety_issue: 'Nor could the system rely on visually sighting whether the mobility hoist was in use, as this case demonstrated - it had only just been deployed when the train departed 71 seconds after having stopped at the station platform. Under similar conditions, it would have been difficult for the train manager to see the mobility hoist even if it had been deployed onto the platform.
