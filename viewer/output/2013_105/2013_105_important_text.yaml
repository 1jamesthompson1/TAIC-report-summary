  \  is required to  ensure that all boarding and alighting passenger s are clear\
  \ of \nthe train and that all doors are closed and secured before giving a \"right\
  \ away \" clearance  to \nthe driver .  The train manager did check the passenger\
  \ activity on the platform, at which time \nthere was none because the mobility\
  \ hoist had not been  deployed onto the platform.  Having \nclosed all the doors\
  \ on the passenger cars, he rece ived a green light indication on his panel, \n\
  which meant to him that all was in order for him to give \"right away \" clearance\
  \ for the driver to \ndepart.  \n4.2. The main safety issue arising from this incident\
  \ was that procedurally there was a disconnect \nbetween the operation of the mobility\
  \ hoist from the luggage van at the rear of the train and \nthe train manager's\
  \ pre-departure checks near the front of the train:  \n\uF0B7 the stowing of the\
  \ mobility hoist and securing of the lugga ge van doors did not \nfeature in the\
  \ train man ager's pre -departure checks  \n\uF0B7 there was no means provided for\
  \ the train attendant in the luggage van to \ncommunicate with the train manager\
  \ near the front of the train  \n\uF0B7 the luggage van doors were not electronically\
  \ connected to the train door status and \ncontrol system . \n4.3. KiwiRail did\
  \ not have a procedure to cover the operation of the mobility hoist.  It had had\
  \ one \nin the past,  but the instructions had been removed from the Rail Operating\
  \ Code when the \nsecond issue of Section 1 (Passenger Rolling Stock R estrictions)\
  \ came into effect on  \n27 August 2012.  \n4.4. The operation of the mobility hoist\
  \ relied on the train manager knowing and/or remembering \nthe stations at which\
  \ any passengers in wheelchairs were to alight , then having good \ncommunication\
  \ with the train at tendant (in this case) to ensure that the operation was \ncomplete\
  \ and the train secure before giving \"right away \" clearance to the driver.  \n\
  4.5. In this case the train manager had operated the mobility hoist at Palmerston\
  \ North to board \nthe three wheelchair  passe ngers , and he sold each of them\
  \ tickets to their respective \ndestinations .   It was most likely that the train\
  \ manager , when he gave \"right away \" clearance  \nto the driver at Waikanae,\
  \ had forgotten that one wheelchair passenger and her support \nperson would b e\
  \ leaving the train  there.  \n4.6. Human memory can be influenced by a number of\
  \ factors , including high workload, late \nrunning, distraction and environmental\
  \ conditions.  Therefore it becomes important that \ncontrols are put in place to\
  \ reduce the risk of human er ror.  It would have been  feasible for the \ntrain\
  \ attendant , instead of the train manager , to have  sold a ticket to a passenger\
  \ requiring \nthe mobility hoist,  so even relying on the train manager's memory\
  \ would not  have  ensure d that \nthey were  aware of the  stations at which the\
  \ mobility hoist would be required.  \n4.7. Nor could the system rely on visually\
  \ sighting whether the mobility hoist was in use, as this \ncase demonstrated  -\
  \ it had only just been  deployed when  the train departed 71 seconds after \nhaving\
  \ stoppe d at the station platform .  The re -enactment following the incident revealed\
  \ \nanother issue.  U nder similar conditions it would have been difficult for the\
  \ train manager to \nsee the mobility hoist even if it had been  deployed onto the\
  \ platform.  From the front \npassenger car there was about a 160-metre distance\
  \ to the doorway of the luggage van.  \nOther passengers waiting on the relatively\
  \ narrow platform could  obscure the train manager's \nline of sight.  This incident\
  \ occurred at dawn, about 12 minutes before s unrise.  The day was \novercast ,\
  \ and despite the station platform lighting the deployed mobility hoist was difficult\
  \ to \nsee from the forward passenger car.  \n4.8. This safety issue has since been\
  \ resolved by KiwiRail.  It has placed high -visibility reflective \ntape on the\
  \ hand rails of the mobility hoist to improve its visibility.  KiwiRail has also\
  \ installed \na light in the luggage van that shines out onto the platform when\
  \ the luggage van doors are \nopen.  \n  \nFinal report RO -2013 -105 \n<< Page\
  \ 9 >>\n 4.9. Nevertheless, relying on the train manager to observe whether or not\
  \ the mobility hoist is in \nuse is not failsafe.  KiwiRail has since provided the\
  \ train attendant with a portable channel -\none radio with which he can communicate\
  \ directly with the train manager and the train driver \nwhen the mobility hoist\
  \ has been  or is to be deployed.   \n4.10.  On 21 August 2014 KiwiRail issued an\
  \ operational memo to all Capital Connection  staff , \nupdating its policy on identifying\
  \ passengers requiring special assistance.  Train managers \nmust record on their\
  \ daily running sheet s the disembarkation requirements for those \npassengers and\
  \ inform the train attendants of those details.  The train attendants are \nrequired\
  \ to contact train managers by portable two -way radio before and after operating\
  \ the \nmobility hoist.  \n4.11.  KiwiRail has also  modified the train door status\
  \ and control system to include an interlock \nbetween the mobility hoist control\
  \ and the train door controls to give a \"train door open\" \nindication whenever\
  \ the wheelchair hoist is deployed.  It has also included the sliding do or of \n\
  the luggage van in the train door status circuitry , which means  that as long as\
  \ the door is open \nthe train manager will not receive a green \"doors -closed\"\
  \  indication at the local door control \npanel.  \n4.12.  The modification to the\
  \ train door status system, p roviding for radio communication between \nthe train\
  \ attendant and the train manager, and the improvements in  the lighting and visibility\
  \ \nof the mobility hoist should prevent a similar incident occurring in future.\
  \  Accordingly the \nCommission has recorded th ese safety actions (see  the safety\
  \ action section below) and has \nnot made any recommendations following this incident.\
