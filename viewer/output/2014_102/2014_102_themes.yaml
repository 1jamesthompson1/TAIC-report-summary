- name: Human Performance Limitations
  explanation: Human performance limitations are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the driver's performance was likely impaired due to the time of day and the length of his shift. The accident occurred "during early morning when human performance is typically at its lowest and when the driver was nearing the end of a nine-hour shift" (4.1.15, 5.3). These factors are known to affect alertness and decision-making, which in this case may have led to the driver not responding correctly to the trackside signals.
- name: Signalling System Comprehension
  explanation: Signalling system comprehension is a safety theme because the train driver did not respond to the signals indicating the train was being directed through the Westfield crossover. The driver had "assumed that his train would be directed back to the Otahuhu yard via a path that he was used to" and as a result, "either did not look at, or saw but did not comprehend the significance of, the three preceding signals and one route indicator" (4.1.14, 4.1.15). This indicates a potential issue with how drivers interpret and act upon signal information.
- name: Lack of System Defences
  explanation: Lack of system defences is a safety theme because at the time of the accident, there were no automatic safeguards in place to prevent an accident if a train driver failed to react correctly to signals. The report states that "the rail system at the time of the accident had no defences in place to mitigate an accident occurring if a train driver did not react correctly to the trackside signals" (4.2, 5.4). This lack of a fail-safe system increased the risk of human error leading to an accident.
- name: Fatigue Management
  explanation: Fatigue management is a safety theme because the driver's state of fatigue could have contributed to the accident. Although the report suggests that "it is unlikely that fatigue was a factor in the accident" based on the driver's roster and comments (4.1.9), the driver did report feeling tired at the end of his shift (4.1.11). This highlights the importance of managing fatigue in safety-critical roles.
- name: Training and Familiarization
  explanation: Training and familiarization are safety themes because the driver's expectation based on his experience and training may have influenced his actions. The driver was familiar with the Auckland rail network and had been trained only on the push-pull train type (4.1.6). His expectation that the train would take the usual route may have caused him to overlook the signals directing him otherwise (4.1.15). This suggests that training should include preparing drivers for unexpected route changes.
- name: Communication and Information Sharing
  explanation: Communication and information sharing are safety themes because the accident could potentially have been prevented if the train controller had communicated the route change to the driver. The report indicates that "additional advice to train drivers about conditions that are likely to affect their trains can help to prevent accidents" (4.3.9). The lack of clear policy and procedures for train controllers to provide route information to drivers is highlighted as an issue (5.6).
