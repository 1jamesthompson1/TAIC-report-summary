  \  \n4.1.1.  According to KiwiRail records, during the week leading up to this accident\
  \ five passenger \ntrains  were directed through the Westfield crossover.  One of\
  \ these was another empty \npassenger train only seven minutes ahead of t he train\
  \ involved in this accident.  The drivers of \nthose five trains responded correctly\
  \ to the same signal aspects, but the driver of the accident \ntrain did not.  The\
  \ accident caused significant damage to the train and track, and had \npotential\
  \ to cause s erious injuries.  \n4.1.2.  Tests carried out by KiwiRail signalling\
  \ engineers showed that the integrated signalling and \npoint s system at Westfield\
  \ was working correctly prior to the accident .  The signalling system \nfor the\
  \ Auckland rail network had been substantiall y redesigned as part of the electrification\
  \ \nproject.  The signals preceding the Westfield crossover had been in place and\
  \ operating for 31 \nmonths before the accident.  R ecords revealed  no reported\
  \ instances of mechanical failure  \nwith the signalling system in the area and\
  \ no reported SPAD incidents.  There were also no \nreports from train drivers of\
  \ signal sighting issues.  \n4.1.3.  Servicing and maintenance records showed that\
  \ the train's braking system was compliant with \nKiwiRail's  mechanical code conditions\
  \ at the time of the accident.  The train driver reported no \nissues with the performance\
  \ of his train.  \n4.1.4.  There was accordingly no evidence or suggestion that\
  \ issues with the train or the rail \ninfrastructure contributed to the accide nt.\
  \ \n4.1.5.  The following analysis discusses possible reasons for the train driver\
  \ not complying with the \nsignals that indicated his train was being directed through\
  \ the Westfield crossover.  It also \ndiscusses the lack of system defences against\
  \ an accident occurr ing if a train driver makes an \nerror in interpreting trackside\
  \ signals.  \nTrain driver actions  \n4.1.6.  The train driver had received his\
  \ initial training during a 21 -month period.  All his practical \ntraining was\
  \ conducted on the Auckland metro network and only on th e push -pull train type.\
  \  \nHis training record was unremarkable, and other than one operating irregularity\
  \ (SPAD), his \nperformance up until the time of the accident was also unremarkable.\
  \  He was familiar with \nthe various main lines around the Auckland rail network,\
  \ and was aware that the Up and Down \nMain lines were bi -directional5, meaning\
  \ that his train could be signalled along either line in \neither direction at any\
  \ location where crossover points were installed.  \n4.1.7.  The train driver said\
  \ he braked the train in  readiness for the approaching permanent speed \nrestriction,\
  \ and only five seconds before his train entered the crossover points.  Transdev\
  \ said \nthat it was normal practice for train drivers to make such a brake application\
  \ in this area \nbecause of the perma nent 40 km per hour speed restriction that\
  \ started about 450 metres \nahead.  \n4.1.8.  There are several reasons to consider\
  \ for the train driver not responding to the three signals \nand one route indicator,\
  \ of which distraction is an obvious one.  However, he was adam ant \nthat he was\
  \ not undertaking any other task and that there were no distracting influences at\
  \ \nthe time.  Closed -circuit television footage of the train passing stations\
  \ between Waitakere \nand Penrose showed that no -one else was in the locomotive\
  \ cab with the train driver at those \ntimes.  Cell phone records showed that the\
  \ driver did not make  or answer  any calls, nor did he \nsend  or receive  any\
  \ text messages during this period.  \n4.1.9.  The Commission considered whether\
  \ fatigue was a factor.  However, t he train drive r's hours of \nduty during the\
  \ preceding four fortnights were unremarkable.  He had five consecutive days off\
  \  \n                                                        \n5 Used to allow trains\
  \ to run in either direction over the same section of track subject to built -in\
  \ safety \nsystems that prevent collisions.  \n     \nFinal report RO -2014-102\
  \ \n<< Page 7 >>\n duty between 22 and 26 February 2014.  He work ed two evening\
  \ shifts (1700 to 0130) on 27 \nand 28 February 2014 , and was on  his third evening\
  \ shift when the accident occurred.   He \nwas due to finish at 0140 .  However,\
  \ at the start of that shift he agreed to a request that he \nextend the shift to\
  \ 0250 .  The train driver reported that he had been fresh and fit for duty at \n\
  the beginning of that third eveni ng shift.  Based on the train driver's roster\
  \ and his comments, \nit is unlikely that fatigue was a factor in the accident.\
  \  \n4.1.10.  During the nine -hour shift the train driver  spent  six hours  and\
  \ 40 minutes  driving trains, \nleaving him  two hours  and 20 minutes for br eaks.\
  \  The train driver said that this had allowed \nhim a mple time to eat and rest\
  \ . \n4.1.11.  The end of the shift and the time of the accident occurred during\
  \ a period when a person's \nnatural circadian rhythm is at its lowest6.  The train\
  \ driver  said that he was fee ling tired at the \nend of the almost -nine-hour\
  \ shift and was looking forward to getting home.  \n4.1.12.  The locomotive's event\
  \ recorder showed that throughout the 3 4-minute journey from \nWaitakere to Penrose\
  \  the train did not exceed the maximum authorised speed .  The train \nspeed between\
  \ Penrose and Westfield was maintained close to the maximum authorised, \nexcept\
  \ when the train was slowed to a temporary limit of 40 km per hour for a short section\
  \ of \ntrack under repair at Penrose.  \n4.1.13.  A review of the locomotive's vigilance\
  \ s ystem7 showed that t he train driver's response  times \nranged between three\
  \  and four seconds  throughout the journey from Waitakere to Westfield.  \nHis\
  \ slowest response was six seconds, which was less than that which would have  cause\
  \ d the \nsystem to generate  an audible alar m in the cab.  \n4.1.14.  The train\
  \ driver said that he had assumed that his train would be directed back to the \n\
  Otahuhu yard via a path that he was used to, which was through the crossover farther\
  \  along \nthe Down Main line at Otahuhu.  Although he acknowl edged that using\
  \ the Westfield crossover \nwas a legitimate option available to the train controller,\
  \ he had not been directed that way \nduring the 20 months he had been driving.\
  \  \n4.1.15.  It is likely that the train driver developed a mind -set that his\
  \ train would be directed along the \nusual (to him) path and would take the crossover\
  \ from the Down Main line at Otahuhu.  As a \nconsequence he either did not look\
  \ at, or saw but did not comprehend  the significance of, the \nthree preceding\
  \ signals and one route indicator that  were telling him that his train was about\
  \ \nto take the Westfield crossover instead.  The accident occurred during early\
  \ morning when \nhuman performance is typically at its lowest and when the driver\
  \ was nearing the end of a \nnine-hour shift.  These two facto rs are likely to\
  \ have adversely affected the driver 's \nperformance.  \n4.1.16.  Both Transdev\
  \ and KiwiRail have embarked on separate projects to increase the awareness of \n\
  signalling unusual movements for their train drivers (refer paragraphs 6.3.1 and\
  \ 6.3.2 in the \n\"Safety actions\" section).  The implementation of the bi -directional\
  \ signalling system now \nmeans that trains can be signalled to the opposing track\
  \ at any of the many crossover points \non the Auckland metro network, without the\
  \ need to impose manual wrong -line-running \nprocedures.  \n  \n              \
  \                                          \n6 The time in the natural body clock\
  \ when performance is at its lowest and the drive for sleep is at its highest. \
  \ \n7 A system that monitors  how often a driver manipulates the brake and throttle\
  \ controls.  If a period of \ninactivity is detected the system generates an alert\
  \ in the cab that the driver must acknowledge.  If they do \nnot acknowledge the\
  \ alarm in time, the train will automatically s top and train control will be alerted.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report RO -2014 -102 Findings  \n1. The locomotive derailed\
  \ and rolled over because it entered the Westfield crossover \npoints travelling\
  \ at 46 km per hour over the maximum permitted speed.  \n2. The train driver did\
  \ not slow his train to negotiate the Westfield crossover because he \nassumed that\
  \ his train would be taking  the usual route through the next crossover \ninstead\
  \ and did not therefore pay attention to the trackside signals that were warning\
  \  \nhim to slow his train.  \n3. The accident occurred during early morning when\
  \ human performance is typically at its \nlowest and when the driver was nearing\
  \ the end of a nine -hour shift.  These two factors \nare likely to have adversely\
  \ affected the driver 's perform ance . \n4.2. Single point of failure  \nSafety\
  \ issue:   There w as no defence in the system to prevent an accident if a train\
  \ driver \ndid not react correctly to signals and route indicators.  \n4.2.1.  At\
  \ the time of this accident the safe passage of the push -pull trains on the Auckland\
  \ rail \nnetwork relied totally on train drivers seeing, interpret ing and respond\
  \ ing accordingly to the \nvarious trackside signals.  \n4.2.2.  Humans are prone\
  \ to making errors.  Accident statistics show that human error features in a \n\
  high percentage of accidents  in any mode of transport.  Therefore a transport system\
  \ that \nrelies solely on a single person's performance to prevent accidents will\
  \ be at considerable risk.  \nPositive train control  \n4.2.3.  At the time of the\
  \ accident, as part of the electrification and re -signal ling of the Auckland \n\
  metropolitan rail network, a form of automatic train protection was also being installed\
  \ (known \nas the European Train Control System) .  With this system a train interact\
  \ s with signals and \ntrackside sensors that are passed.  The train i s automatically\
  \ slowed to the correct speed or, if \nnecessary, brought to a stop i f the driver\
  \ does not take the appropriate action for a signal . \n4.2.4.  The system is not\
  \ intended to replace the driver's responsibility to observe and act on all \ntrackside\
  \ signals.  It is purely a defence to mitigate the risk of human error.  \n4.2.5.\
  \  The train protection system requires modification s to the trains and to the\
  \ signalling system.  \nNew electric passenger trains currently being commissioned\
  \ are fitted with the system, and \nmodifica tions to the signalling system were\
  \ complete d after the accident .  Had such a system \nbeen installed and operating\
  \ on the diesel -operated push -pull train involved in this accident, \nand been\
  \ fully commissioned to the signalling system in the Westfield area  at the time\
  \ , the \ntrain would have been automatically slowed to the appropriate speed before\
  \ the crossover \nand the accident would have been prevented.  \n4.2.6.  However,\
  \ the push -pull trains have not been fitted with the system because they are due\
  \ to be \nphased out by August 2015 with the introduction of the new electric trains.\
  \  Transdev and \nAuckland Transport considered the estimated $11 million to retrofit\
  \ the push -pull trains with \nthe system equipment to be not cost effective.  This\
  \ was a reasonable decision.  \n  \n     \nFinal report RO -2014-102 \n<< Page 9\
  \ >>\n 4.3. Additional advice from train controllers  \nSafety  issue :  KiwiRail's\
  \  current policy and procedures regarding information that train \ncontrollers\
  \ should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other \n\
  factors that are likely to affect the trains' progress are unclear and not consistent\
  \ with \nprotocols fo r good communication and crew resource management . \n4.3.1.\
  \  If the driver had had a mind -set that his train would cross  over at Otahuhu,\
  \ that mind-set could \nhave been broken if the train controller had offered the\
  \ information that he had selected the \nWestfield cros sover.  \n4.3.2.  The train\
  \ driver said that  he recalled an occasion weeks earlier  when he had been told\
  \ by a \ntrain controller that his path through  Otahuhu station would be different\
  \ from that normally \ntaken.  After the accident the driver asked why he had not\
  \  recei ved a similar radio call on this \noccasion.  \n4.3.3.  The Commission\
  \ had raised t he matter of train controllers providing additional advice with \n\
  Tranz Rail (a predecessor to KiwiRail) during its investigations of two  high-speed\
  \ roll -overs \nduring 1993 and 1997 .  The two roll-overs had involved freight\
  \ trains at the same set of \ncrossover points in Te Kauwhata (north Waikato). \
  \ \n4.3.4.  Tranz Rail  had advised the Commission on 12 August 1997 that \"any\
  \ dilution of the signalling \nsystem by train drivers relying on prior radio calls\
  \ from train controllers was not acceptable \". \n4.3.5.  In response to this latest\
  \ accident KiwiRail said that it had not changed that philosophy , and \nadded that\
  \ there was no written documentation that required train controllers to make such\
  \ \ncalls.  KiwiRail  acknowledged that such calls could be made with the best of\
  \ intentions.  T rain \ncontrollers could make such calls, if time permitted, in\
  \ sudden emergency situation s. \n4.3.6.  The Commission had raised this subject\
  \ again in its report on a wrong line running irregul arity \nin 2011 (report 11\
  \ -101).  In that case the train controller's plan to hold one train at a location\
  \ \nto give priority to another was relayed to the signaller s involved, but no\
  \ -one informed the \nrespective train drivers because the KiwiRail rules did not\
  \  require that.  The report commented \nthat only some of the six parties involved\
  \ in the execution of the plan (the train controller, the \ntwo signaller s, the\
  \ person in charge of a work site and the drivers of the two trains) were \ninformed\
  \ of it.  \n4.3.7.  The Commissi on recommended then that the Chief Executive of\
  \ the NZ Transport Agency:  \nrequire  the executive of the Rail System Standard\
  \ to develop standards to ensure that \nall rail participants meet a consistently\
  \ high level of crew resource management, and \ncommunicati on that includes the\
  \ use of standard rail phraseology (recommendation \n002/12 ). \n4.3.8.  The Chief\
  \ Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied:  \nWe intend to work closely with\
  \ the National Rail System Standard (NRSS) Executive \nwith an aim to implementing\
  \ and closing  out this recommendation as soon as \npracticable.  The NZ Transport\
  \ Agency sits on the NRSS Executive as an observer.  We \nwill consider a strategy\
  \ for rail operators outside the NRSS coverage . \n4.3.9.  The recommendation still\
  \ has an open status.  The circumstances of this latest accident \nprovide  further\
  \ evidence that additional advice to train drivers about conditions that are likely\
  \ \nto affect their train s can help to prevent accidents.  Currently the K iwiRail\
  \ policy on the issue is \nunclear.  There are no procedures to guide train controllers\
  \ on best practice, yet in its \nresponse to the Commission KiwiRail management\
  \ said that there were times  when such \nadvice could be given \"with the best\
  \ of intentions\"  and that it \"expects train controllers to \nmake such calls,\
  \ if time permitted, in a sudden emergency situation\".  The issue with that \n\
  philosophy is that it is not necessarily the reason for a diversion that the train\
  \ driver needs to \nknow.  The information will be useful to drivers regardless\
  \ of the reason.  It could prevent \naccidents such as this.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n\
  \ Final report RO -2014 -102 4.3.10.  At the time of this accident there were a\
  \ greater number of passenger trains operating on the \nAuckland network following\
  \ a special entertainment event.  One optio n that KiwiRail could \nhave taken was\
