- name: Inadequate Use of Navigation Systems
  explanation: The theme of inadequate use of navigation systems is highly relevant to this accident as the primary electronic navigation system, the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), was not utilized to its full potential. The crew were not fully conversant with its safety features, which compromised the ship's ability to navigate safely. "The primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral, the ECDIS, was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features" (4.1.5). Furthermore, the ECDIS safety parameters were not set appropriately for the confined channel navigation, reducing its effectiveness as a monitoring system "Not changing safety parameters to match the mode of navigation degraded the usefulness of the ECDIS as a system for monitoring the progress of the ship in a confined channel" (4.2.25).
- name: Poor Bridge Resource Management
  explanation: Poor bridge resource management is a significant safety theme in this accident. The standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral during the Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice. The bridge team failed to effectively challenge and respond to the pilot's actions, which led to the vessel deviating from the planned track without intervention. "The standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral during the Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice" (4.1.5). Additionally, there was a reluctance among the bridge team to question the person in command, which is a fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management "At the time of this and a previous accident, the reluctance of the bridge team to question the person in command or control of the ship was preventing effective challenge and response, a fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management" (5.8).
- name: Reliance on Faulty Equipment
  explanation: The reliance on faulty equipment is another safety theme that contributed to the accident. The rate-of-turn indicator, which was crucial for the pilotage, was known to be functioning erratically and had been a long-standing issue. The bridge team's decision to use a rate-of-turn method for conducting the pilotage despite the faulty indicator likely contributed to the accident. "The remote rate-of-turn indicator at the centre-front of the bridge was behaving erratically, deviating several degrees either side of the true value" (4.2.5). This equipment unreliability led to challenges in monitoring the ship's turn rate effectively "The unreliability of the rate-of-turn equipment questions the efficacy of conducting the pilotage based on the rate of turn, instead of issuing helm orders to maintain the desired track" (4.2.7).
- name: Inadequate Pilotage Planning and Execution
  explanation: Inadequate pilotage planning and execution is a central safety theme in this incident. The pilot initiated the turn earlier than planned without challenge from the crew, and there was no prior agreement on how far from the planned track the ship would be allowed to deviate. "The pilot later explained that he preferred to start his turns slowly and gradually increase the rate of turn. This was a departure from the agreed passage plan" (4.2.9). The lack of a clear understanding and adherence to the pilotage plan contributed to the loss of situational awareness and the subsequent grounding "The chain of events that led to the L'Austral grounding began when the pilot initiated the turn earlier than expected" (4.2.16).
- name: Insufficient Risk Assessment for Blind Pilotage
  explanation: Insufficient risk assessment for blind pilotage by the regional authority, Environment Southland, is a safety theme that has broader implications for maritime operations in the area. The absence of visual navigation aids and the reliance on electronic navigation systems during blind pilotage in confined waters were risks that had not been fully considered. "conducting blind pilotage with large ships in confined waters represented risks that had not been fully considered by environment southland" (4.1.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The recommendation for Environment Southland to review its risk assessment for the area underscores the importance of this safety theme "The Commission recommends that Environment Southland review its current risk assessment for the area and consider what measures could be introduced to improve navigational safety within the Fiordland region" (4.3.11).
- name: Ineffective Communication and Monitoring
  explanation: Ineffective communication and monitoring among the bridge team is a safety theme that played a critical role in the accident. The alarms from the radar and ECDIS indicating deviation from the planned track were not acted upon, and the bridge team did not voice their concerns or effectively monitor the ship's progress against the agreed plan. "None of these alarms caused any of the bridge team to voice their concern over the progress of the ship in the turn" (4.2.12). The lack of effective communication and monitoring is further highlighted by the master's failure to verbally intervene when noticing the deviation "The master said that he noticed the ship deviating significantly from the planned track, and that instead of voicing his concern as he was standing next to the pilot he made a hand gesture in the dark for him to turn further to port" (4.2.13).
