  \  \n4.1.1.  A vessel grounding, for however short a time, is a serious occurrence\
  \ that can potentially \ncause damage to the vessel and the environment.  \n4.1.2.\
  \  The passage into Milford Sound requires large alteration s of course with  little\
  \ margin for error,  \nwhich  meant it was important for the transit to be managed\
  \ and monitored carefully by the \nbridge team.  \n4.1.3.  For a successful harbour\
  \ transit:  \n\uF0B7 the pass age plan should be accurate and agreed by the entire\
  \ bridge team (whic h \nincludes the pilot), then  \n\uF0B7 the team should agree\
  \ on how the passage plan will be conducted, then  the position of \nthe ship should\
  \ be closely monitored against the agreed plan, and  \n\uF0B7 any deviation from\
  \ the plan should be challenged and either rectified or acc epted.  \n4.1.4.  The\
  \ ship's crew and the pilot involved held the required qualifications and were current\
  \ for the \ntask. Notwithstanding this, the ship deviate d from the planned track\
  \ and ground ed on the \nshoreline.  \n4.1.5.  The following analysis discusses\
  \ why on this occasion the vessel grounded.  In doing so it \nraises  three  safety\
  \ issues:  \n\uF0B7 the primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral , the\
  \ ECDIS, was not being \nused to its full potential as a tool for planning and m\
  \ onitoring the ship's passage, and \nthe crew were not fully conversant with its\
  \ safety features   \n\uF0B7 the standard of bridge resource management on board\
  \ the L'Austral  during the \nMilford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry\
  \ practice  \n\uF0B7 conducting blind pilotage  with large ships in confined waters\
  \ represents risks that had \nnot been fully considered by Environment Southland\
  \ , the regional authorit y that \nregulate s maritime activit y in the area.  \n\
  4.2. What happened  \nPassage planning  \n4.2.1.  Environment Southland's Fiordland\
  \ Pilot s Standard Operating Procedures  contained the \nstandard operating procedures\
  \ and safety management information for pilotage in Fiordland.   \n4.2.2.  The procedures\
  \ included information on the recommended route for entering Milford So und.  \n\
  This information included  written directions, a course card, and chartlet s for\
  \ entering Milford \nSound ( Figure 5 and see Appendix 1) . \n4.2.3.  The L'Austral\
  \ 's passage plan  (see Appendix 3)  was similar to that contained in the Fiordland\
  \ \nPilots Standard Operating Procedures , with a track  that ke pt the vessel close\
  \  to the centre of \nthe waterway .  The pilot and the bridge team agreed to use\
  \ the ship's passage plan, which had \nbeen loaded into the ship's navigation equipment.\
  \   From this perspective there was no issue \nwith the passage plan.  It was ac\
  \ curate and agreed to by the entire bridge team.  \n \n \n \nFinal Report MO -2017\
  \ -202 \n<< Page 13 >>\n Conduct of the ship  \nFigure 5 \nChartlets showing typical\
  \ tracks for rounding Dale Point \n4.2.4.  When  the master arrived on the bridge,\
  \ the maste r/pilot information exchange took place with \nthe officer of the watch\
  \ close -by while still maintaining the navigational watch.  The pilot \ninformed\
  \ the master that he would require a vessel speed of 12 knots when they approached\
  \ \nthe turn at Dale Point and that the rate of turn would be between 15 \xB0 and\
  \ 20 \xB0 to achieve the \nturn.   These rates of turn would give turn radii of\
  \ 0. 76 and 0.57 nautical miles  respectively \n(see Figure 5). \n4.2.5.  The rate\
  \ -of-turn indicator on the helmsman's steering console  was believed to be functioning\
  \ \ncorrectly.  However, the remote rate -of-turn indicator at the centre -front\
  \ of the bridge was \nbehaving erratically, deviating several degrees either side\
  \ of the true value.  This was a long-\nstanding issue that the company had been\
  \ working with the equipment manufacturer to \nrectify.  \n4.2.6.  The crew had\
  \ not activated the vessel  predictor function on either the ECDIS or radars.  This\
  \ \nfunction would normally provide a predicted outline of where the ship would\
  \ be at a \npredefined interval in future.  The function relies on input on the\
  \ ship 's speed over the ground \nand its rate  of turn.  Given the erratic performance\
  \ of the rate -of-turn indicator, the function \nwould likely have been  of limited\
  \ use to the bridge team.  \n4.2.7.  It is likely that t he helmsman was the only\
  \ person who had a reliable rate -of-turn indicator \navailable.  This was  going\
  \ to make it difficult for the rest of the bridge team to check if the \ncorrect\
  \ rate  of turn was being achieved by the helmsman.  The unreliability of the rate\
  \ -of-turn \nequipment  question s the efficacy of conducting the pilotage based\
  \ on the rate of tur n, instead \nof issuing helm orders to maintain the desired\
  \ track.  \n4.2.8.  At about 0536 the pilot assumed the con of the vessel from the\
  \ officer of the watch  and \ncontinued on track as the speed of the vessel increased\
  \ to the requested 12 knots .  At \napproximately 05 50 the pilot ordered a rate\
  \ of turn of 2\xB0  to port when the vessel was still \nabout 2.3 cables16 from\
  \ the designated wheel -over17 position for the turn off Dale Point (see \nFigure\
  \ 2).  The helmsman acknowledged the order and confirmed once he had the ship at\
  \ the \ncorrect rate of turn. \n                                               \
  \         \n16 One cable is one 10th of a nautical mile or 185.2 metres.  \n17 The\
  \ point at whic h a ship's wheel is put over to initiate the turning of the vessel\
  \ .  \nPredicted course for a 15\xB0 rate of turn at  \n12 knots (turn radius 0.76\
  \ nautical miles)  \n(pilot's minimum expected)   \nPredicted course for a 20\xB0\
  \ rate of turn at  \n12 knots (turn radius 0.57  nautical miles)  \n(pilot's maximum\
  \ expected)  \n\n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -202 4.2.9.  The pilot\
  \ later explained that he preferred to start his turns slowly and gradually increase\
  \  the \nrate of turn.  This was a departure from the agreed passage plan , which\
  \ had a designated \npoint  at which the turn would begin .  None o f the ship's\
  \ crew challenged the early turn.  \n4.2.10.  According to the hel msman he was\
  \ achieving the rate  of turn ordered by the pilot from the \ninitial 2\xB0  and\
  \ through the successive  5\xB0, 10\xB0 and 15\xB0  as read from the rate -of-turn\
  \ indicator \non the steering column befo re him . \n4.2.11.  By the time the pilot\
  \ ordered the 15\xB0 rate of turn to port the ship was at the designated wheel -\n\
  over position , but it was slightly starboard of the planned track in spite of the\
  \ turn to port \nhaving been initiated more than one minute earlier (see Figure\
  \ 2).  One explanation for this is \nthat the easterly wind , which was gusting\
  \ up to 25 knots , was pushing  the ship  towards the \nsouthern shoreline . \n\
  4.2.12.  Soon after the  L'Austral passed the wheel -over position , the pilot ordered\
  \  a 20\xB0 rate of turn  to \nport.  The ship briefly regained  the planned track\
  \ , but then again  deviate d further  and further \nto starboard  of it.  A series\
  \ of alarms sounded from the radar and the ECDIS , alerting the \nbridge team that\
  \ the ship was deviating from  the planned track .  None of  these  alarms caused\
  \ \nany of the bridge team to voice their concern over  the progress of the ship\
  \ in the turn.  \n4.2.13.  The master said that he noticed the ship deviating significantly\
  \ from the planned track , and \nthat instead of voicing his concern as he was standin\
  \ g next to the pilot  he made a hand \ngesture  in the dark  for him to turn further\
  \ to port .  According to the master, the pilot \nacknowledged his gesture .  The\
  \ pilot said that he did not see the gesture .  The pilot then \nasked the helmsman\
  \ to confirm the ship's heading.  At about 0554  the master went to the \nstarboard\
  \ bridge wing and saw how close the ship was to the shoreline.  The master exclaimed\
  \ \nto the pilot \"L'arriere - L'arriere\" (meaning \"the stern\" i n French) from\
  \ his position at the \nbridge wing . \n4.2.14.  At about the same time,  the pilot\
  \  noticed that the L'Austral had deviated far from the planned \ntrack  and took\
  \ further corrective action by  order ing a 30\xB0 rate of turn to port .  The pilot\
  \ then  \nordered the helm  to amidships then 20 \xB0 to starboard in an attempt\
  \ to prevent the stern and \npropellers stri king the seabed.  \n4.2.15.  At 0554:45\
  \ the starboard side of  the L'Austral struck the stone bank on the south side of\
  \ \nMilford Sound.  \n4.2.16.  The chain of events that led to the L'Austral  grounding\
  \ began when the pilot initiated the turn \nearlier than expected.  The conduct\
  \ of the pilotage appeared to have been  somewhat  focused \non what the required\
  \ rate of turn was in order for the ship to follow the planned track in the \nturn,\
  \ rath er than focus ing on strictly following the planned track by altering the\
  \ rate of turn  to \ncounter other influences that were affecting the ship, such\
  \ as wind and tide.  \n4.2.17.  The tracks were clearly displayed on all of the\
  \ bridge equipment that the bridge team wer e \nmonitoring.  It is likely that the\
  \ pilot became overly  focused on  the rate of turn , which he would \nhave had\
  \ difficulty monitor ing given the faulty equipment.  As a result , he lost situational\
  \ \nawareness as to where the ship was, where it was heading, and what other factors\
  \ were \ninfluencing its progress.  \n4.2.18.  The bridge team were not paying sufficient\
  \ attention to monitoring the progress of the ship \nagainst the agreed plan . \
  \ This is discussed in the following section.  \nMonitoring  \nSafety issue - The\
  \ primary means for navigation on board the  L'Austral , the ECDIS, was not \nbeing\
  \ used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage,\
  \ and \nthe crew were not fully conversant with its safety features.  \n4.2.19.\
  \  In order for a bridge team to monitor the progress of a ship, there first must\
  \ be agreement on \nthe plan, which includes the agreed track and the speed at which\
  \ the ship will travel along it.   \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -202 \n<< Page 15\
  \ >>\n There  also must be agreement on what is considered  an acceptable deviation\
  \ from the plan \nbefore a challeng e18 is made . \n4.2.20.  As mentioned above,\
  \ there was agreement on the planned track.  However, there was no \nagreement on\
  \ how far off the planned track the ship would be allowed to deviate.  \n4.2.21.\
  \  The approaches to and transit s of Milford Sound were  restrictive for a ship\
  \ th e size of the \nL'Austral .  Even  a small deviation would have put the ship\
  \ at risk of grounding.  Therefore the \nship's speed and progress along the planned\
  \ track would need to have been  closely \nmonitored and even the slightest deviation\
  \ scrutinised, talked a bout and rectified.  \n4.2.22.  An ECDIS with a radar overlay\
  \ was the prime method being used to monitor the L'Austral 's \ntrack.  The IMO\
  \ described an ECDIS in Performance Standards for Electronic Chart Display and \n\
  Information Systems (ECDIS)  (IMO Resolution A.817(19))  as: \n\u2026 a navigation\
  \ information system which, with adequate back up arrangements, \ncan be accepted\
  \ as complying with the up -to-date chart required by regulation \nV/19 & V/27 of\
  \ the 1974 SOLAS Convention19, by displaying selected \ninformation from navigation\
  \ se nsors to assist the mariner in route planning and \nroute monitoring, and by\
  \ displaying additional navigation -related information if \nrequired.   \n4.2.23.\
  \  User -defined safety settings are a safety function when using an ECDIS.  A failure\
  \ to enter the \ncorrect safety se ttings can allow a vessel to enter unsafe waters\
  \ without alerting the operator.  \nTo achieve a safe passage plan, users of ECDIS\
  \ s must understand how to determine \naccurately the correct value for a safety\
  \ setting (see Figure 7).   \n \n                                              \
  \          \n18 'Challenge' is the bridge resource management term used for raising\
  \ an alert or questioning the actions or \ninactions of persons, or anything that\
  \ might seem out of the ordinary.  \n19 The International Convention for the Safety\
  \ of Life at Sea. \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -202  \nFigure 6\
  \ \nDiagram showing ECDIS safety parameters  \n4.2.24.  IMO specifications required\
  \ an ECDIS to trigger certain alarms for the following conditions:  \n\uF0B7 if\
  \ the vessel is predicted to cross the safety contour within a  user-specified time\
  \  \n\uF0B7 if the vessel is predicted to cross the boundary of a prohibited area\
  \ or an area for \nwhich special conditions exist within a specified time  \n\uF0B7\
  \ if the vessel deviates off course by a specified amount from the planned route;\
  \ cross -\ntrack dis tance  \n\uF0B7 if the vessel continues on its present course\
  \ over a user -defined time or distance and \nis predicted to pass closer to an\
  \ object that is shallower than the safety contour or an \naid to navigation.  \
  \ \n4.2.25.  The vessel's passage plan included safety parameters that had been\
  \ uploaded into the \nvessel 's ECDIS.  The operator's safety management system\
  \ required that the ECDIS safety \nparameters . or the \"antigrounding [sic] settings\"\
  \ be adapted to the type of navigation: \noffshore, coastal or port approach.  However,\
  \ pe rmanent safety parameters had been set in \nthe L'Austral  ECDIS regardless\
  \ of the phase of the  ship's  voyage (see Figure  7).  Not changing \nsafety parameters\
  \ to match  the mode of navigation  degrade d the usefulness of the ECDIS as \n\
  a system for monitoring the p rogress of the ship  in a confined channel . \nadded\

  \ \n<< Page 17 >>\n  \nFigure 7 \nDiagram showing permanent ECDIS safety parameters\
  \ on board the L'Austral  \n4.2.26.  The entrance to Milford Sound is both narrow\
  \ and deep .  The water is  50 metres d eep to \nwithin approximately 140 metres\
  \ of the shoreline where  the L'Austral grounded .  The entrance \nis approximately\
  \ 540 metres wide at its narrowest point.  Using the ECDIS permanent safety \nparameters,\
  \ the added breadth would have alarm ed even when the vesse l was in the centre\
  \ \nof the channel; the safety depth would not have alarmed until the vessel was\
  \ close to the \nshoreline ; and the  look-ahead would have been in a state of alarm\
  \ before the ship enter ed the \npilotage limit.  \n4.2.27.  Some of the safety\
  \ parameter setting s did alarm as the ship deviated well off the track.  \nHowever,\
  \ none of these alarms was acted upon and none was brought to the pilot's attention.\
  \  \n4.2.28.  The ECDIS would  have been a useful  aid to navigation when entering\
  \ Milford Sound had the \nchosen parameters been set appropriately  and adhered\
  \ to .  It could have warned the bridge \nteam that the vessel was not where they\
  \ wanted it to be and focused the master 's and pilot 's \nattention on preve nting\
  \ the vessel grounding.  \n4.2.29.  Regardless of the ECDIS alarm settings, it was\
  \ readily apparent from looking at the ECDIS and \nradar that the ship was deviating\
  \ significantly from the planned track.  \n4.2.30.  On 9 January 2017, one month\
  \ before this accident, L'Austral was involved in another \naccident when it struck\
  \ an uncharted rock when it was being manoeuvred close inshore \naround the sub\
  \ -Antarctic Snares Islands.  In its report on that accident, the Commission \n\
  recommended that the operator review its procedures for the  setting up, training\
  \ in and \nongoing support for ECDISs on all of its ships.  The recommendation is\
  \ equally applicable to \nthis accident.  \n4.2.31.  The use of the ECDIS and other\
  \ electronic navigation aids was important because it was dark \nand there were\
  \  little or no external aids to guide the ship down the channel.  This situation\
  \ \ncalled for blind pilotage techniques to be used, which is discussed in the following\
  \ section.  \nFindings  \n1. The L'Austral  made contact with the shoreline while\
  \ making a turn in Milfo rd \nSound because  the harbour pilot lost situational\
  \ awareness as to where the ship \nwas, where it was heading, and what other factors\
  \ were influencing its progress.  \n2. The master and officer of the watch both\
  \ noticed that the L'Austral  had deviated \nsubstantial ly from the planned track,\
  \ but neither spoke up until it was too late to \nprevent the ship grounding near\
  \ the shoreline.  \n3. The planned track for the pilotage into Milford Sound was\
  \ appropriate and \nagreed by all persons in the bridge team.  However, there was\
  \ no discussion on \nhow the conduct of the pilotage would be undertaken and how\
  \  far from the \nplanned track the ship would be allowed to deviate.  \n \n\n \n\
  \n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -202 4. The bridge team agreeing to use\
  \ a rate -of-turn method for conducting the \npilotage when the rate -of-turn-indic\
  \ ator on board the L'Austral  was faulty was \nlikely a factor contributing to\
  \ the accident.  \n5. The ship's crew were not totally familiar with, and did not\
  \ use all of the safety \nfeatures of the ECDIS, the ship's primary electronic navigation\
  \ system.  \n4.3. Blind pilotage  \nSafety issue : Conducting blind pilotage with\
  \ large ships in confined waters represent ed risks \nthat had not been fully considered\
  \ by Environment Southland, the regional authority that \nregulates maritime activity\
  \ in the area.  \n4.3.1.  There are no visual navi gation aids in Milford Sound\
  \ to assist navigators in monitoring the \nposition and progress of their ships.\
  \  Consequently, during periods of restricted visibility or \nduring the hours of\
  \ darkness , navigators must revert to blind pilotage techniques.  \n4.3.2.  The\
  \ pilot  had conducted approximately 200 acts of pilotage into and out of Milford\
  \ Sound , of \nwhich 20 had been  during the hours of darkness.  The pilot had also\
  \ undertaken regular \nsimulator training for blind pilotage into and out of Port\
  \ Otago .  However, at the time of the \naccident he had not conducted simulator\
  \ training for blind pilotage into Milford Sound, nor did \nEnvironment Southland's\
  \ Pilot Training Program me and Proficiency Plan20 require him to have \ndone so.\
  \  \n4.3.3.  Because during blind pilotage there are n o outside c ues to help pilots\
  \ maintain 'spatial ' \nawareness, the pilot s rely totally on their ships ' electronic\
  \ navigation systems.  Therefore , \npilots  must have faith that the equipment\
  \ they are provided with is accurate, is working \ncorrectly and can be rel ied\
  \ upon.  They must also use such equipment to good effect.  \n4.3.4.  On this occasion\
  \ the pilot and the assistant pilot were unsure about the reliability of the \n\
  L'Austral 's rate-of-turn indicator , which resulted in a lack of confidence in\
  \ the equipment.  The \npilot was equally concerned about the reliability  of the\
  \ ECDIS vessel predictor , which was fed \ndata  from the rate -of-turn indicator\
  \ . \n4.3.5.  As part of the master /pilot information exchange , the master is\
  \ expected to inform the pilot if \nthere are any defects with the navigational\
  \ equipment on board the vessel.  The rate-of-turn \nindicator was an important\
  \  piece of equipment and the master should have informed the pilot \nof any previous\
  \ issues and that it was not functioning correctly, particularly as the pilot had\
  \ \nbriefed the bridge team  that he intended to use rate of turn  for making the\
  \ turn off Dale Point .    \n4.3.6.  Information on the status of the bridge equipment\
  \ was sourced from the ship operator.  It \nshowed that the rate-of-turn indicators\
  \ and repeaters had suffered  technical problems during \nthe previous six months.\
  \  From August 2016 until October 2016 the rate-of-turn indicators had \nbeen unreliable\
  \ .  In October they had been  turned  off.  In November the defect had been  \n\
  identified and the rate-of-turn indicators were  deemed to be \"working with the\
  \ assistance of \ntechnical services\" . \n4.3.7.  In his submission on the report,\
  \ the master said that he was not aware that the rate -of-turn \nindicator was not\
  \ functioning correctly  when the ship was entering Milford Sound .  From the \n\
  pilots' comments and the data downloaded from the ship's voyage data recorder ,\
  \ it was \nalmost certain that the rate-of-turn indicators were  not functioning\
  \ reliab ly at this time.   The \nship predictor image on the radar and ECDIS was\
  \ moving  erratically on the scr een. \n4.3.8.  However, the rate -of-turn indicators\
  \ were not absolutely required in order to navigate blind. As \npreviously mentioned\
  \ , the ECDIS and radar had important features and techniques that could \nhave\
  \  assist ed in maintaining the agreed track down Milford Sound.  These were either\
  \ not \n                                                        \n20 Environment\
  \ Southland Pilot Training Programme and Proficiency Plan, Fiordland Pilotage Areas\
  \ (revised \n16 May 2012).  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -202 \n<< Page 19 >>\n programmed\
  \ or not used by any of the bridge team.  As a  result , the pilot lost awareness\
  \ of \nhow the turn off Dale Point was progressing.  \n4.3.9.  As the relevant regional\
  \ council , Environment Southland may regulate the ports, harbours and \nwater in\
  \ the Fiordland region, as well as maritime -related activities21. This includes\
  \  the \nregulation of marine operations for cruise ships.  \n4.3.10.  The increasing\
  \ frequency, scale and duration of cruise ship traffic through Fiordland means \n\
  that appropriate me asures need to be in place to mitigate the risk s posed by blind\
  \ pilotage. In \naddition, Milford Sound is not the only passage where blind pilotage\
  \ is relied on.   \n4.3.11.  The Commission recommends that Environment Southland\
  \ review its current risk assessment \nfor th e area and consider what measures\
  \ could be introduced to improve  navigational safety \nwithin the Fiordland region.\
  \ These could  include : the provision of more navigational aids; \nensuring training\
  \ and currency for pilots in blind pilotage techniques; and prohibiting night \n\
  navigation of certain passages if considered necessary.  \nFindings  \n6. The darkness\
  \ and absence of visual navigation aids out side the ship meant  that \nthe bridge\
  \ team were totally reliant on the ship's electronic navigation aids and \nsystems\
  \ (referred to as blind pilotage).  However, the bridge team were not \nmaking full\
  \ use of the available equipment to ensure  that the ship stayed  on \ntrack . \n\
  7. Environment Southland had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the risk of\
  \ \nlarge ships having to conduct blind pilotage in the confined waters of Fiordland.\
  \  \n4.4. Bridge resource management  \nSafety issue: The standard of bridge resource\
  \ management  on board  the L'Austral  during the \nMilford Sound pilotage did not\
  \ meet good industry practice.  \n4.4.1.  Many of the prerequisites for good bridge\
  \ resource management had been met before the \npilotage act began.  Unlike most\
  \  acts of pilotage , where a pilot boards a ship and begins \npiloting almost immediately,\
  \ t he pilot had been on board the L'Austral  for two days .  He had \nworked with\
  \ the bridge team during  several acts of pilotage within Fiordland and had  had\
  \ the \nopportunity to become familiar with the bridge equipme nt. \n4.4.2.  The\
  \ pilot and the vessel's bridge team were working from the same passage plan, which\
  \ \nclosely followed the passage plan prescribed in the Fiordland Pilots Standard\
  \ Operating \nProcedures .  From the data downloaded from the voyage data recorder\
  \  it can be heard that \nwhen the pilot c ame onto the bridge before taking the\
  \ con of  the L'Austral there was positive \nengagement between the bridge team\
  \ and the pilot . \n4.4.3.  The master/pilot information exchange was carried out\
  \ in good time and included the officer \nof the wa tch, who was in audible range\
  \ .  The information exchange was carried out prior to \nentering each fiord and\
  \ the proposed route was discussed and agreed upon.  The master , pilot \nand bridge\
  \ team all shared a common understanding of the route to be taken.  The pilot was\
  \ \nheard to reiterate that he \"welcomed questions and challenges on any aspect\
  \ \". \n4.4.4.  As part of the master/pilot information exchange , an accurately\
  \ completed pilot information \ncard (see Appendix 2)  provides the pilot with much\
  \ of  the essential information he requires for \nthe passage and any manoeuvres\
  \ that may be carried out.  This information can be \nsupplemente d by discussion\
  \ s with the master and bridge team.  A cop y of the International \nChamber of\
  \ Shipping's Bridge Procedures Guide Annex A2 is provided  in Appendix 6; it can\
  \ be \n                                                        \n21 Maritime Transport\
  \ Act 1994, section 33C.  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -202 considered\
  \ industry good practice  and follows the recommendations of IMO Resolution \nA.601(15)\
  \ , Provision and Display of Manoeuvring Information on Board Ships. \n4.4.5.  Nevertheless,\
  \ the grounding  still occurred .  In the lead -up to the grounding , one of the\
  \ key \nelements  was absent, that of challenge and response.  As the L'Austral\
  \ deviated south of the \nagreed track nobody on the navigating bridg e verbally\
  \ questioned the pilot as to his intentions , \nat a time when he had lost situational\
  \ awareness and most needed an intervention or \nchallenge from the crew.  \n4.4.6.\
  \  The officer of the watch  was monitoring the vessel 's position  and realised\
  \ that the vessel wa s \nstraying from the agreed track .  However,  he was not\
  \ confident enough to question the pilot \nwhen the master was also on the bridge.\
  \  \n4.4.7.  On 9 January 2017, o ne month before this accident , the L'Austral\
  \ had been  involved in \nanother accident when it struck an uncharted rock while\
  \  being manoeuvred close inshore \naround  the sub-Antarctic Snares Islands . \
  \ The master had had the con of the vessel  and \nanother officer of the watch \
  \ indicated she had not been confident questioning the master 's \ninstructions\
  \ . \n4.4.8.  This and the previous accident indicate d that putting effective bridge\
  \ resource management  \ninto practi ce was not routine.  With at least two watch\
  \ -keeping officers on board showing a \nreluctan ce to question the master, any\
  \ intervention on the pilot's actions  was effectively left  to \nthe master.  \
  \  \n4.4.9.  However, the master did not  intervene when the pilot lost situational\
  \ awareness, except  to \ngestur e in the dark  that the ship should be further\
  \ to port .  In his submission on the draft \nreport, the master commented that\
  \  he had had every confidence in the pilot and that it \"would \nnot [have been]\
  \ appropriate for him to override the pilot's command \".  Leaving  any \nintervention\
  \ to when the ship had deviated so far off course that it was about to strike the\
  \ \nshoreline is an ind ication that the concept of bridge resource management was\
  \ not fully \nunderstood.   The objective of bridge resource management is to achieve\
  \ safe navigation and \nnot allow a situation to develop to the point where the\
  \ communication is centred on \nminimising t he damage once a grounding has become\
  \ inevitable.  \n4.4.10.  Subordinate officers being reluctant to question a superior\
  \ or the person in command or \ncontrol of a ship is symptomatic of what is often\
  \ referred to a s a 'power -distance relationship '.  \nSuch a relationship  is\
  \ a deterrent to subordinates challeng ing the actions of a superior, even if \n\
  those actions or inactions are detrimental to the safe navigation of the ship. \
  \ A power -distance \nrelationship is a major threat to the performance of a bridge\
  \ team . \n4.4.11.  In its repor t on the previous grounding involving the  L'Austral\
  \ , the Commission recommended  \nthat the operator review its safety management\
  \ system to ensure a better standard of bridge \nresource management  on board.\
  \  The recommendation is equally applicable to this accident.  \n4.4.12.  The Commission\
  \ has found poor bridge resource management under pilotage to be  a factor \ncontributing\
  \ to accidents involving two other ships in New Zealand22.  The reports make \n\
  several recommendations aimed at improving the standard of pilotage and making the\
  \ \ntransition of a pilot into a ship's bridge team seamless.  \nFinding  \n8. At\
  \ the time of this and a previous accident , the reluctance of the bridge \nteam\
  \ to question the person in command or control of the ship  was \npreventing effective\
  \  challenge and response, a fundamental aspect of good \nbridge resource management.\
