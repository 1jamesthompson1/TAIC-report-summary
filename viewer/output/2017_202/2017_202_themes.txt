Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate use of electronic navigation systems: The crew did not fully utilize the safety features of the ECDIS and were not familiar with its functions, leading to a lack of situational awareness and inability to monitor the ship's progress effectively.

2. Poor bridge resource management: The bridge team did not effectively challenge or question the pilot's actions, even when they noticed deviations from the planned track. There was a power-distance relationship that deterred subordinates from questioning the person in command, hindering effective communication and decision-making.

3. Conducting blind pilotage in confined waters: Blind pilotage techniques were used due to the absence of visual navigation aids, but the bridge team did not make full use of available equipment to ensure the ship stayed on track. The regional authority did not adequately consider the risks associated with blind pilotage in confined waters.

4. Faulty rate-of-turn indicator: The bridge team agreed to use a rate-of-turn method for the pilotage, despite knowing that the rate-of-turn indicator was faulty. This contributed to the accident as the pilot lost situational awareness and could not accurately monitor the ship's progress.

5. Lack of communication and intervention: The master and officer of the watch noticed deviations from the planned track but did not speak up or intervene until it was too late to prevent the grounding. There was a lack of effective challenge and response within the bridge team.

6. Inadequate monitoring of ship's progress: The bridge team did not pay sufficient attention to monitoring the ship against the agreed plan, leading to a failure to detect and rectify deviations from the planned track.

7. Insufficient risk assessment and measures: The regional authority did not take sufficient measures to reduce the risk of blind pilotage in confined waters, highlighting a lack of adequate risk assessment and safety measures.

8. Lack of training and familiarity with blind pilotage techniques: The pilot had not undergone simulator training for blind pilotage in Milford Sound, and the bridge team did not make full use of available equipment and techniques for blind pilotage.

9. Power-distance relationship: The reluctance of the bridge team to question the person in command or control of the ship hindered effective challenge and response, indicating a power-distance relationship that impacted communication and decision-making.
