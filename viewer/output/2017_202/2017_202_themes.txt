Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate use of electronic navigation systems: The crew did not fully utilize the safety features of the ECDIS and were not familiar with its functions, leading to a lack of situational awareness and inability to monitor the ship's progress effectively.

2. Poor bridge resource management: The bridge team did not effectively challenge or question the pilot's actions, leading to a loss of situational awareness and failure to prevent the ship from deviating off the planned track.

3. Conducting blind pilotage in confined waters: Blind pilotage techniques were used due to the absence of visual navigation aids, but the bridge team did not make full use of available equipment to ensure the ship stayed on track. The regional authority did not adequately consider the risks associated with blind pilotage in confined waters.
