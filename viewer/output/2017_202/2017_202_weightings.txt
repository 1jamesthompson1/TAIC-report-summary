","2.887","0.0","Although the crew and pilot held the required qualifications, the accident was not attributed to a lack of training and competency but rather to the failure to use equipment effectively and maintain situational awareness (""The ship's crew and the pilot involved held the required qualifications and were current for the task"" (4.1.4)).","0.0","18.333","The crew were not fully conversant with the ECDIS safety features and did not use the equipment to its full potential, which contributed to the grounding (""the primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral, the ECDIS, was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features"" (4.1.5), ""The ship's crew were not totally familiar with, and did not use all of the safety features of the ECDIS"" (5.5)).
","2.887","23.333","The bridge team's reluctance to question the pilot's actions and the absence of challenge and response were key factors in the accident (""At the time of this and a previous accident, the reluctance of the bridge team to question the person in command or control of the ship was preventing effective challenge and response, a fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management"" (5.8), ""one of the key elements was absent, that of challenge and response"" (4.4.5)).
