The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is  a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquirie s is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulat ory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1 At about 0530 on 9 February  2017 , the passenger cruise ship L'Austral  began its entry to 
Milford Sound with an authorised harbour pilot on board .  Because it was dark and there were 
no external visual navigation aids, the bridge team was using only the ship's electronic 
navigation systems to conduct the pilotage.  
1.2 As the ship was making a turn off Dale Point, the pilot lost awareness of exactly whe re the ship 
was, the direction  in which it was heading and the effect s of the wind and tide on the ship.   
1.3 The L'Austral  deviated well off the planned track and struck a stony bank near the shoreline of 
Milford Sound.  The ship suffered scraping and indenta tion of the hull on its starboard side, but 
the hull was not breached and nobody on board was injured.  
1.4 The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the ship's crew on 
the bridge noticed the ship was off its planned track, but did  not bring this to the pilot's 
attention until it was too late to avert the grounding.  
1.5 The Commission found  that the bridge team were not making full use of the ship's electronic 
navigation systems to ensure  that the ship stayed on track.  
1.6 The Commission id entified three safety issues : 
 the primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral , the electronic chart display 
and information system , was not being used to its full potential as a tool for planning 
and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were  not fully conversant with its 
safety features  
 the standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral  during the Milford 
Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice  
 conducting 'blind pilotage ' with large ships in confined waters represent ed risks that 
had not been  fully considered by Environment Southland,  the regional authority that 
regulate s maritime activit y in the area . 
1.7 The Commission repeated two previous recommendations  to the ship's operator (Compagnie 
des Iles du Ponant ) and made one new recommendation  to Environment Southland to address 
the safety issues.    
1.8 The Commission had previously found  that poor bridge resource management under pilotage 
was a factor contributing to accidents involving two other ships in New Zealand .  Their two 
reports had made several recommendations  aimed at improving the standard of pilotage and 
making the transition of the pilot into the ship's bridge team seamless.  
1.9 Key lessons  arising from this inquiry were : 
 a ship's passage plan is more than ju st the planned track for the ship to follow.  Every 
part of a ship 's voyage must be planned and all members of the bridge team be fully 
familiar with and agree to the plan. This is a cornerstone of good bridge resource 
management  
 good bridge resource manag ement relies on a culture where challenge is welcomed and 
responded to, regardless of rank, personality or nationality  
 an electronic chart display and information system  is a valuable aid to navigation.  
However, mariners need to fully understand and be familiar with all aspects of the 
system, particularly when using it for blind pilotage.

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 9 February 2017 Maritime New Zealand notified the Tran sport Accident Investigation 
Commission (Commission) of the occurrence .  The Commission opened an inquiry under 
section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990, and appointed 
an investigator in charge.  
2.2. Contact was established with the Bureau d'Enquêtes sur les Événements de Mer, the French 
independent safety investigation authority.  An agreement was reached that New Zeala nd 
would proceed as the Marine Safety Investigating State in accordance with the International 
Maritime Organization  (IMO)  Casualty Investigation Code.  
2.3. On 10 February 2017, after confirming some of the details of the accident, two Commission 
investigators deployed to Dunedin where the L'Austral was due to berth on 11 February 2017 .   
2.4. On 11 February 2017 the investigation team interviewed the master and crew involved and 
gathered evidence  from the vessel .  The following day the investigation team interviewed the 
two Fiordland pilots who had been  on the vessel at the time of the occurrence , and gathered 
more evidence.  
2.5. In the following weeks the investigation team continued to gather evidence from interested 
persons and con duct interviews  with,  including but not limited to , Maritime New Zealand, the 
vessel's operator  (Compagnie des Iles du Ponant  [Ponant] ), Environment Southland, Port 
Otago and equipment manufacturers.   
2.6. On 22 February 2018 the Commission approved the draft report to be circulated to 12 
interested persons for comment.  
2.7. Six submissions were received.  The Commission considered the submissions, and changes as 
a result of those submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.8. On 20 June 2018 the Commission app roved the final report for publication.

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The L'Austral  is a French -registered passenger cruise ship that was operating a nine-day 
cruise from Auckland to Milford Sound .  The ship stopped at several ports on the east coast of 
New Zealand , the last of which was Dunedin.  From Dunedin the ship travelled through 
Foveaux Strait to Fiordland, where it transited several other prominent sounds before arriving 
off Milford Sound , which is part of the Te W āhipounamu - South West New Zealand World 
Heritage Area , a UNESCO world heritage site2 (see Figure 2 ). 
 
Figure 2  
Extract of chart showing route of the L'Austral  
3.1.2.  On 7 February 2017 t he L'Austral  departed the port of Dunedin  with two Port Otago licen sed 
pilots on board.  Both pilots were also licen sed by Environment Southland regional council  to 
pilot ships through various sounds within Fiordland, including Milford Sound .  The second pilot 
was on board to observe the first pilot (the pilot) take the ship through  Cook Channel and 
Paget P assage in Dusky Sound, as the second pilot had never taken ships through either  of 
those passage s. 
3.1.3.  The pilot conducted  the pilotage from the L'Austral 's berth in Dunedin to below the 'Halfway 
Islands ' near  Port Chalmers , where the second pilot took  over the pilotage  for the lower 
harbour  transit .  Once clear of the lower harbour the second pilot handed the con3 to the 
ship's crew for the passage  to Fiordland . 
3.1.4.  At about 1400 on 8 February the vessel arrived off the entrance  to Dusky Sound , where the 
con was handed back to the pilot . The L'Austral entered Dusky Sound under his direction.  
3.1.5.  The pilot took the vessel through Cook Channel and Paget Passage , with the second pilot 
observing .  The second pilot then took the con for t he transit through Acheron Passage and

 out into the Tasman Sea via Breaksea Sound , where he handed the con back to the ship's 
crew for the short passage to Doubtful Sound.  
3.1.6.  The second pilot  resumed the con outside Doubtful Sound and took  the vessel into Doubtful 
Sound  and into Thompson Sound.  T he two pilots shared the con of the vessel as it cruised up 
and down Thompson Sound while dinner was served.  The second  pilot then took the  con for 
the voyage out of  the northern entrance of Thomp son Sound .  At about midnight he handed 
the con back to the ship's crew for the trip around to Milford Sound . 
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  At about 0525 on 9 February the pilot arrived on the navigating bridge as the L'Austral  was 
rounding S aint Anne Point (see Figure 1) .  The pilot discussed with the officer of the watch the 
speed required  and rate of turn4 as the ship rounded Dale Point.  At 0531 the master arrived 
on the navigating bridge and the pilot and master , together with the officer of the watch , 
conducted their inf ormation exchange and agreed on the passage plan for entering Milford 
Sound.  
3.2.2.  The speed of the L'Austral was increased to 12 knots  and at 0536 the pilot took the con of 
the vessel from the officer of the watch .   
3.2.3.  At 0550:45 the pilot ordered the turn into Milford Sound around Dale Poi nt with a 2 ° rate of 
turn to port5 (see Figure 3).  In the following two and a half minutes the pilot ordered 
successive increase s in the rate of turn through 5°, 10°, 15° and 20° to port  (see Figure 3). 
3.2.4.  At 0553:2 0, as the pilot ordered a 20° rate  of turn to port , the vessel was south of the 
intended course and drifting farther south away from the intended track .   
3.2.5.  At 0554:20 the pilot ordered a 30° rate of turn to port .

 3.2.6.  At some time after  the pilot ordered a 30° rate  of turn to port , the officer of the watch became 
aware that the vessel was close to the shoreline of Milford Sound .  He moved to the 
starboard6 bridge wing7 and looked aft to see if the stern8 of the vessel was clearing the 
shoreline .  The master also went to the starboard bridge wing , and when he realised how close 
the vessel was  to the shoreline  he exclaimed to the pilot , "L'arriere - L'arriere " (meaning "the 
stern" in French) from his position at the bridge wing .  At 05:54:4 0 the L'Austral  collided with 
a stony  bank that extend ed from the shoreline.  As the vessel cleared the bank the pilot 
ordered amidships9 on the wheel and then a helm order of 20° to starboard in an attempt  to 
carry  the stern of the vessel away from the shoreline .   
3.2.7.  The pilot con ned the vessel into the middle of the sound while  the master and the remainder 
of the bridge followed  a vessel -grounding checklist from the Contingency Plan and Emergency 
Manual .  While this was happening t he pilot continued to con the L'Austral to the position 
agreed on for the passenger transfer operation , which took place after the vessel anchored . 
3.3. Accident damage  
3.3.1.  The post -grounding checks revealed that the hull had not been breached.  The master ordered 
a visual underwater dive survey of the vessel's hull.  
3.3.2.  The dive survey revealed that the vessel's hull was indented along the starboard side  for 
about 65 metres.  These indentations occurred in void10 numbers 6, 10 and 11.  In the void 
spaces minor deformation of longitudinal stiffeners had occurred.  
3.3.3.  The external protective coating along a section of the hull had been scraped off  and the 
starboard bilge keel11 had been deformed along part of its length , but it had not detached 
from the hull  (see Figure 4) .

 3.4. Vessel details  
3.4.1.  The L'Austral  is a cruise vessel  built by Fincantieri , Ancona in Italy in 2010.   It is owned by 
CMA CGM S.A. in France and  operated by Ponant.  
3.4.2.  The L'Austral had a length overall of 142.1 met res and a breadth of 18 m etres .  It had a 
maximum draught of 4.9 m etres.  The vessel  was powered by four Wärtsilä  8L20 1 ,600-
kilowatt diesel electric generators driving two asynchronous electric motors , each driving a 
single fixed -pitch propeller.  The L'Austral was fitted with  a single 800 -kilowatt  bow thruster 
and dual Becker rudders12. 
3.4.3.  The L'Austral was equipped with the range of navigational equipment standard for the type of 
vessel , including an electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS) and  a backup 
system that was complia nt with international and Flag S tate rules and regulations.  This 
configuration meant that the vessel could use  the ECDIS as its primary method of navigation 
and was not required to carry paper charts .  However , the vessel was equipped with a full folio 
of paper cha rts that were used in conjunction with the ECDIS.

3.5.1.  The L'Austral  had 156 crew on board .  The safe manning certificate required it to have a 
minimum of 52 crew.  
3.5.2.  The master had been at sea for 25 years and had obtained his STCW  (Standards of Training, 
Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers)  II/2 certificate of competency limited to ships 
with less than 15,000 gross tonn es. The master had worked for the operator for 22 years, 
during which time he  had implemented the operator's safety mana gement system . He had 
also been the training manager for  two years.  
3.5.3.  The officer of the watch held an STCW II/1 certificate of competency , unlimited , for both deck 
and engine room operations.   He was on his second contract with Ponant on the L'Austral and 
had been on board the vessel since 7 January 2017.   
3.5.4.  The p ilot had been a pilot for Port Otago since 1994 and had completed more than  5,000 acts 
of pilotage .  Since 2006 the pilot had completed approximately 200 pilotages into and out of 
Milford Sound , including approximately 20 pilotages during the hours of darkness.  He had 
also completed pilotages during periods of reduced visibility.  Over the years the pilot had , on 
several occasions, completed 'blind pilotage '13 training  for Port Otago  in a vessel simulator.  
The pilot had been externally audited on behalf of Environment Southland during January 
2017.  
3.5.5.  The second pilot , after several years at sea, had been a pilot in Gladstone, Australia for 
approximately four years before becoming a pilot i n Port Ot ago in July 2016.  He had gained 
his licence for Port Chalmers and Dunedin at the end of November 2016 and gained his 
licence to conduct pilotages in Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds at the end of January 
2017.   
3.6. Port details  
3.6.1.  Environment Southland is the  regional council with responsibility for navigational safety in 
Fiordland.  It is responsible for  the Southland Navigation Safety Bylaws 2009 as revised in 
December 2015, which govern safe navigation practices on the rivers, lakes and sea, out to 
the 12 -nautical -mile limit  of the Environment Southland region .

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 3.6.2.  The majority of the fiords that are accessible to cruise vessels have been designated 
compulsory pilotage areas for vessels over 500 gross ton nes under Maritime Rules Part 90, 
Pilotage . 
3.6.3.  Environment Southland has a deed of agreement with the New Zealand cruise ship industry 
that permits cruise ships to enter certain fiords .  Pilotage is provided for the fiords by two 
companies : Fiordland Pilotage Services (a subsidiary of Port Otago) ; and South  Port (the 
commercial operator of the port of Bluff).   
3.6.4.  Environment Southland has a safety management system for cruise ships in Fiordland that 
was developed in accordance with the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code 
(2016) . It include s: 
 the Safety Management System Plan  
 the deed  
 the pilot training and proficienc y plan for Fiordland pilotage areas  
 the Fiordland pilots' instructions and standard operating procedures  
 the New Zealand Police 's Fiordland/Coastal Passenger Ship Emergency Plan.   
3.7. Environmental conditions  
3.7.1.  Low tide for Fresh water Basin (at the head of Milford Sound) on 9 February 2017 was at 
0437, about one and a half hours before the L'Austral  grounded.   High water was predicted to 
be at 1029, about four and a half hours after t he time of the grounding.  The predicted rate of 
tidal flow near the entrance to Milford Sound was negligible (less than 0.5 knots) . 
3.7.2.  The wind  outside the entrance to Milford Sound was described as south -south -easterly at 10-
15 knots.   In the entrance to Milford Sound the wind (from the voyage data recorder14 
readout) was mainly south -easterly at about 25 gusting to 35 knots.  The visibility was good 
but with overcast sk y.  Due to the complete ly overcast  sky and the location , there was little to 
no ambient light. 
3.8. Blind pilotage  
3.8.1.  Navigating in little or no ambient light and with no visual navigation aids increases the  risk of 
incidents and accidents occurring .  Blind pilotage is the navigation of a vessel in confined 
waters in low or restricted visibility with little or no recourse to the visual observation of objects 
outside the vessel.   
3.8.2.  In blind pilotage  the visual aspect is either removed or unreliable , so re liance falls onto 
electronic and other navigational aids.  The use of an ECDIS and radar become s more 
important , and the passage plan loaded  onto these aids must be accurate, utilised and 
followed to ensure a successful outcome.  
3.9. Passage planning  
3.9.1.  The IMO's Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines for Voyage Planning, adopted on 25 November 
1999, states the following for  voyage (passage) planning:  
1.1  The development of a plan for voyage or passage, as well as the close and 
continuous monitoring of the ves sel's progress and position during the 
execution of such a plan, are of essential importance for safety of life at sea, 
safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment.  
1.2  The need for voyage and passage planning applies to a ll vessels. There are 
several factors that may impede the safe navigation of all vessels and 
additional factors that may impede the navigation of large vessels or vessels 
carrying hazardous cargoes. These factors will need to be taken into account in 
                                                        
14 equipment fitted on  board a ship that record s data on the status and operation of various equipment and 
systems on board.  
 
Final Report MO -2017 -202

 the p reparation of the plan and in the subsequent monitoring of the execution 
of the plan.  
1.3  Voyage and passage planning includes appraisal, i.e. gathering all information 
relevant to the contemplated voyage or passage; detailed planning of the whole 
voyage or passage from berth to berth, including those areas necessitating the 
presence of a pilot; execution of the plan; and the monitoring of the progress of 
the vessel in the implementation of the plan.   
A more detailed explanation of the guidelines can be f ound in Appendix 4. 
3.10.  Bridge resource management  
3.10.1.  Bridge resource management is an important concept for ensuring  that a ship keeps to the 
agreed passage plan.  Bridge resource management was adopted in the early 1990s by the 
maritime industry as a safety and error management tool.  It has since become an integral 
part of crew training and is included in the International Convention on Standards of Training, 
Certi fication and Watchkeeping  for Seafarers  developed by the IMO (see Appendix 5).   
3.10.2.  Bridge resource management  is described as the effective management and utilisation of all 
resources, human and technical, available to a bridge team, to help ensure the safe 
completion of the vessel's voyage.  
3.10.3.  Some essential aspects of bridge resource management  are good closed -loop 
communications15, participants sharing the same understanding of a planned passage, and 
maintaining situational awareness.  
3.10.4.  Good communication is a particularly important aspect of good bridge resource management.  
It involves  talking and agreeing on the plan; clear closed -loop communication in conducting 
the plan; and a clear and concise challenge and response if the ship is d eviating from the 
agreed plan.  
 
                                                        
15  A technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats it back. The 
sender then confirms the message , usually by using the word 'yes'. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message 
back, the sender will say "negative", or something similar, then repeat the correct message.

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  A vessel grounding, for however short a time, is a serious occurrence that can potentially 
cause damage to the vessel and the environment.  
4.1.2.  The passage into Milford Sound requires large alteration s of course with  little margin for error,  
which  meant it was important for the transit to be managed and monitored carefully by the 
bridge team.  
4.1.3.  For a successful harbour transit:  
 the pass age plan should be accurate and agreed by the entire bridge team (whic h 
includes the pilot), then  
 the team should agree on how the passage plan will be conducted, then  the position of 
the ship should be closely monitored against the agreed plan, and  
 any deviation from the plan should be challenged and either rectified or acc epted.  
4.1.4.  The ship's crew and the pilot involved held the required qualifications and were current for the 
task. Notwithstanding this, the ship deviate d from the planned track and ground ed on the 
shoreline.  
4.1.5.  The following analysis discusses why on this occasion the vessel grounded.  In doing so it 
raises  three  safety issues:  
 the primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral , the ECDIS, was not being 
used to its full potential as a tool for planning and m onitoring the ship's passage, and 
the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features   
 the standard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral  during the 
Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice  
 conducting blind pilotage  with large ships in confined waters represents risks that had 
not been fully considered by Environment Southland , the regional authorit y that 
regulate s maritime activit y in the area.  
4.2. What happened  
Passage planning  
4.2.1.  Environment Southland's Fiordland Pilot s Standard Operating Procedures  contained the 
standard operating procedures and safety management information for pilotage in Fiordland.   
4.2.2.  The procedures included information on the recommended route for entering Milford So und.  
This information included  written directions, a course card, and chartlet s for entering Milford 
Sound ( Figure 5 and see Appendix 1) . 
4.2.3.  The L'Austral 's passage plan  (see Appendix 3)  was similar to that contained in the Fiordland 
Pilots Standard Operating Procedures , with a track  that ke pt the vessel close  to the centre of 
the waterway .  The pilot and the bridge team agreed to use the ship's passage plan, which had 
been loaded into the ship's navigation equipment.   From this perspective there was no issue 
with the passage plan.  It was ac curate and agreed to by the entire bridge team.

4.2.4.  When  the master arrived on the bridge, the maste r/pilot information exchange took place with 
the officer of the watch close -by while still maintaining the navigational watch.  The pilot 
informed the master that he would require a vessel speed of 12 knots when they approached 
the turn at Dale Point and that the rate of turn would be between 15 ° and 20 ° to achieve the 
turn.   These rates of turn would give turn radii of 0. 76 and 0.57 nautical miles  respectively 
(see Figure 5). 
4.2.5.  The rate -of-turn indicator on the helmsman's steering console  was believed to be functioning 
correctly.  However, the remote rate -of-turn indicator at the centre -front of the bridge was 
behaving erratically, deviating several degrees either side of the true value.  This was a long-
standing issue that the company had been working with the equipment manufacturer to 
rectify.  
4.2.6.  The crew had not activated the vessel  predictor function on either the ECDIS or radars.  This 
function would normally provide a predicted outline of where the ship would be at a 
predefined interval in future.  The function relies on input on the ship 's speed over the ground 
and its rate  of turn.  Given the erratic performance of the rate -of-turn indicator, the function 
would likely have been  of limited use to the bridge team.  
4.2.7.  It is likely that t he helmsman was the only person who had a reliable rate -of-turn indicator 
available.  This was  going to make it difficult for the rest of the bridge team to check if the 
correct rate  of turn was being achieved by the helmsman.  The unreliability of the rate -of-turn 
equipment  question s the efficacy of conducting the pilotage based on the rate of tur n, instead 
of issuing helm orders to maintain the desired track.  
4.2.8.  At about 0536 the pilot assumed the con of the vessel from the officer of the watch  and 
continued on track as the speed of the vessel increased to the requested 12 knots .  At 
approximately 05 50 the pilot ordered a rate of turn of 2°  to port when the vessel was still 
about 2.3 cables16 from the designated wheel -over17 position for the turn off Dale Point (see 
Figure 2).  The helmsman acknowledged the order and confirmed once he had the ship at the 
correct rate of turn.

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -202 4.2.9.  The pilot later explained that he preferred to start his turns slowly and gradually increase  the 
rate of turn.  This was a departure from the agreed passage plan , which had a designated 
point  at which the turn would begin .  None o f the ship's crew challenged the early turn.  
4.2.10.  According to the hel msman he was achieving the rate  of turn ordered by the pilot from the 
initial 2°  and through the successive  5°, 10° and 15°  as read from the rate -of-turn indicator 
on the steering column befo re him . 
4.2.11.  By the time the pilot ordered the 15° rate of turn to port the ship was at the designated wheel -
over position , but it was slightly starboard of the planned track in spite of the turn to port 
having been initiated more than one minute earlier (see Figure 2).  One explanation for this is 
that the easterly wind , which was gusting up to 25 knots , was pushing  the ship  towards the 
southern shoreline . 
4.2.12.  Soon after the  L'Austral passed the wheel -over position , the pilot ordered  a 20° rate of turn  to 
port.  The ship briefly regained  the planned track , but then again  deviate d further  and further 
to starboard  of it.  A series of alarms sounded from the radar and the ECDIS , alerting the 
bridge team that the ship was deviating from  the planned track .  None of  these  alarms caused 
any of the bridge team to voice their concern over  the progress of the ship in the turn.  
4.2.13.  The master said that he noticed the ship deviating significantly from the planned track , and 
that instead of voicing his concern as he was standin g next to the pilot  he made a hand 
gesture  in the dark  for him to turn further to port .  According to the master, the pilot 
acknowledged his gesture .  The pilot said that he did not see the gesture .  The pilot then 
asked the helmsman to confirm the ship's heading.  At about 0554  the master went to the 
starboard bridge wing and saw how close the ship was to the shoreline.  The master exclaimed 
to the pilot "L'arriere - L'arriere" (meaning "the stern" i n French) from his position at the 
bridge wing . 
4.2.14.  At about the same time,  the pilot  noticed that the L'Austral had deviated far from the planned 
track  and took further corrective action by  order ing a 30° rate of turn to port .  The pilot then  
ordered the helm  to amidships then 20 ° to starboard in an attempt to prevent the stern and 
propellers stri king the seabed.  
4.2.15.  At 0554:45 the starboard side of  the L'Austral struck the stone bank on the south side of 
Milford Sound.  
4.2.16.  The chain of events that led to the L'Austral  grounding began when the pilot initiated the turn 
earlier than expected.  The conduct of the pilotage appeared to have been  somewhat  focused 
on what the required rate of turn was in order for the ship to follow the planned track in the 
turn, rath er than focus ing on strictly following the planned track by altering the rate of turn  to 
counter other influences that were affecting the ship, such as wind and tide.  
4.2.17.  The tracks were clearly displayed on all of the bridge equipment that the bridge team wer e 
monitoring.  It is likely that the pilot became overly  focused on  the rate of turn , which he would 
have had difficulty monitor ing given the faulty equipment.  As a result , he lost situational 
awareness as to where the ship was, where it was heading, and what other factors were 
influencing its progress.  
4.2.18.  The bridge team were not paying sufficient attention to monitoring the progress of the ship 
against the agreed plan .  This is discussed in the following section.  
Monitoring  
Safety issue - The primary means for navigation on board the  L'Austral , the ECDIS, was not 
being used to its full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and 
the crew were not fully conversant with its safety features.  
4.2.19.  In order for a bridge team to monitor the progress of a ship, there first must be agreement on 
the plan, which includes the agreed track and the speed at which the ship will travel along it.   
 
Final Report MO -2017 -202 
<< Page 15 >>
 There  also must be agreement on what is considered  an acceptable deviation from the plan 
before a challeng e18 is made . 
4.2.20.  As mentioned above, there was agreement on the planned track.  However, there was no 
agreement on how far off the planned track the ship would be allowed to deviate.  
4.2.21.  The approaches to and transit s of Milford Sound were  restrictive for a ship th e size of the 
L'Austral .  Even  a small deviation would have put the ship at risk of grounding.  Therefore the 
ship's speed and progress along the planned track would need to have been  closely 
monitored and even the slightest deviation scrutinised, talked a bout and rectified.  
4.2.22.  An ECDIS with a radar overlay was the prime method being used to monitor the L'Austral 's 
track.  The IMO described an ECDIS in Performance Standards for Electronic Chart Display and 
Information Systems (ECDIS)  (IMO Resolution A.817(19))  as: 
… a navigation information system which, with adequate back up arrangements, 
can be accepted as complying with the up -to-date chart required by regulation 
V/19 & V/27 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention19, by displaying selected 
information from navigation se nsors to assist the mariner in route planning and 
route monitoring, and by displaying additional navigation -related information if 
required.   
4.2.23.  User -defined safety settings are a safety function when using an ECDIS.  A failure to enter the 
correct safety se ttings can allow a vessel to enter unsafe waters without alerting the operator.  
To achieve a safe passage plan, users of ECDIS s must understand how to determine 
accurately the correct value for a safety setting (see Figure 7).

Figure 6 
Diagram showing ECDIS safety parameters  
4.2.24.  IMO specifications required an ECDIS to trigger certain alarms for the following conditions:  
 if the vessel is predicted to cross the safety contour within a  user-specified time  
 if the vessel is predicted to cross the boundary of a prohibited area or an area for 
which special conditions exist within a specified time  
 if the vessel deviates off course by a specified amount from the planned route; cross -
track dis tance  
 if the vessel continues on its present course over a user -defined time or distance and 
is predicted to pass closer to an object that is shallower than the safety contour or an 
aid to navigation.   
4.2.25.  The vessel's passage plan included safety parameters that had been uploaded into the 
vessel 's ECDIS.  The operator's safety management system required that the ECDIS safety 
parameters . or the "antigrounding [sic] settings" be adapted to the type of navigation: 
offshore, coastal or port approach.  However, pe rmanent safety parameters had been set in 
the L'Austral  ECDIS regardless of the phase of the  ship's  voyage (see Figure  7).  Not changing 
safety parameters to match  the mode of navigation  degrade d the usefulness of the ECDIS as

4.2.26.  The entrance to Milford Sound is both narrow and deep .  The water is  50 metres d eep to 
within approximately 140 metres of the shoreline where  the L'Austral grounded .  The entrance 
is approximately 540 metres wide at its narrowest point.  Using the ECDIS permanent safety 
parameters, the added breadth would have alarm ed even when the vesse l was in the centre 
of the channel; the safety depth would not have alarmed until the vessel was close to the 
shoreline ; and the  look-ahead would have been in a state of alarm before the ship enter ed the 
pilotage limit.  
4.2.27.  Some of the safety parameter setting s did alarm as the ship deviated well off the track.  
However, none of these alarms was acted upon and none was brought to the pilot's attention.  
4.2.28.  The ECDIS would  have been a useful  aid to navigation when entering Milford Sound had the 
chosen parameters been set appropriately  and adhered to .  It could have warned the bridge 
team that the vessel was not where they wanted it to be and focused the master 's and pilot 's 
attention on preve nting the vessel grounding.  
4.2.29.  Regardless of the ECDIS alarm settings, it was readily apparent from looking at the ECDIS and 
radar that the ship was deviating significantly from the planned track.  
4.2.30.  On 9 January 2017, one month before this accident, L'Austral was involved in another 
accident when it struck an uncharted rock when it was being manoeuvred close inshore 
around the sub -Antarctic Snares Islands.  In its report on that accident, the Commission 
recommended that the operator review its procedures for the  setting up, training in and 
ongoing support for ECDISs on all of its ships.  The recommendation is equally applicable to 
this accident.  
4.2.31.  The use of the ECDIS and other electronic navigation aids was important because it was dark 
and there were  little or no external aids to guide the ship down the channel.  This situation 
called for blind pilotage techniques to be used, which is discussed in the following section.  
Findings  
1. The L'Austral  made contact with the shoreline while making a turn in Milfo rd 
Sound because  the harbour pilot lost situational awareness as to where the ship 
was, where it was heading, and what other factors were influencing its progress.  
2. The master and officer of the watch both noticed that the L'Austral  had deviated 
substantial ly from the planned track, but neither spoke up until it was too late to 
prevent the ship grounding near the shoreline.  
3. The planned track for the pilotage into Milford Sound was appropriate and 
agreed by all persons in the bridge team.  However, there was no discussion on 
how the conduct of the pilotage would be undertaken and how  far from the 
planned track the ship would be allowed to deviate.  
 

 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -202 4. The bridge team agreeing to use a rate -of-turn method for conducting the 
pilotage when the rate -of-turn-indic ator on board the L'Austral  was faulty was 
likely a factor contributing to the accident.  
5. The ship's crew were not totally familiar with, and did not use all of the safety 
features of the ECDIS, the ship's primary electronic navigation system.  
4.3. Blind pilotage  
Safety issue : Conducting blind pilotage with large ships in confined waters represent ed risks 
that had not been fully considered by Environment Southland, the regional authority that 
regulates maritime activity in the area.  
4.3.1.  There are no visual navi gation aids in Milford Sound to assist navigators in monitoring the 
position and progress of their ships.  Consequently, during periods of restricted visibility or 
during the hours of darkness , navigators must revert to blind pilotage techniques.  
4.3.2.  The pilot  had conducted approximately 200 acts of pilotage into and out of Milford Sound , of 
which 20 had been  during the hours of darkness.  The pilot had also undertaken regular 
simulator training for blind pilotage into and out of Port Otago .  However, at the time of the 
accident he had not conducted simulator training for blind pilotage into Milford Sound, nor did 
Environment Southland's Pilot Training Program me and Proficiency Plan20 require him to have 
done so.  
4.3.3.  Because during blind pilotage there are n o outside c ues to help pilots maintain 'spatial ' 
awareness, the pilot s rely totally on their ships ' electronic navigation systems.  Therefore , 
pilots  must have faith that the equipment they are provided with is accurate, is working 
correctly and can be rel ied upon.  They must also use such equipment to good effect.  
4.3.4.  On this occasion the pilot and the assistant pilot were unsure about the reliability of the 
L'Austral 's rate-of-turn indicator , which resulted in a lack of confidence in the equipment.  The 
pilot was equally concerned about the reliability  of the ECDIS vessel predictor , which was fed 
data  from the rate -of-turn indicator . 
4.3.5.  As part of the master /pilot information exchange , the master is expected to inform the pilot if 
there are any defects with the navigational equipment on board the vessel.  The rate-of-turn 
indicator was an important  piece of equipment and the master should have informed the pilot 
of any previous issues and that it was not functioning correctly, particularly as the pilot had 
briefed the bridge team  that he intended to use rate of turn  for making the turn off Dale Point .    
4.3.6.  Information on the status of the bridge equipment was sourced from the ship operator.  It 
showed that the rate-of-turn indicators and repeaters had suffered  technical problems during 
the previous six months.  From August 2016 until October 2016 the rate-of-turn indicators had 
been unreliable .  In October they had been  turned  off.  In November the defect had been  
identified and the rate-of-turn indicators were  deemed to be "working with the assistance of 
technical services" . 
4.3.7.  In his submission on the report, the master said that he was not aware that the rate -of-turn 
indicator was not functioning correctly  when the ship was entering Milford Sound .  From the 
pilots' comments and the data downloaded from the ship's voyage data recorder , it was 
almost certain that the rate-of-turn indicators were  not functioning reliab ly at this time.   The 
ship predictor image on the radar and ECDIS was moving  erratically on the scr een. 
4.3.8.  However, the rate -of-turn indicators were not absolutely required in order to navigate blind. As

 programmed or not used by any of the bridge team.  As a  result , the pilot lost awareness of 
how the turn off Dale Point was progressing.  
4.3.9.  As the relevant regional council , Environment Southland may regulate the ports, harbours and 
water in the Fiordland region, as well as maritime -related activities21. This includes  the 
regulation of marine operations for cruise ships.  
4.3.10.  The increasing frequency, scale and duration of cruise ship traffic through Fiordland means 
that appropriate me asures need to be in place to mitigate the risk s posed by blind pilotage. In 
addition, Milford Sound is not the only passage where blind pilotage is relied on.   
4.3.11.  The Commission recommends that Environment Southland review its current risk assessment 
for th e area and consider what measures could be introduced to improve  navigational safety 
within the Fiordland region. These could  include : the provision of more navigational aids; 
ensuring training and currency for pilots in blind pilotage techniques; and prohibiting night 
navigation of certain passages if considered necessary.  
Findings  
6. The darkness and absence of visual navigation aids out side the ship meant  that 
the bridge team were totally reliant on the ship's electronic navigation aids and 
systems (referred to as blind pilotage).  However, the bridge team were not 
making full use of the available equipment to ensure  that the ship stayed  on 
track . 
7. Environment Southland had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the risk of 
large ships having to conduct blind pilotage in the confined waters of Fiordland.  
4.4. Bridge resource management  
Safety issue: The standard of bridge resource management  on board  the L'Austral  during the 
Milford Sound pilotage did not meet good industry practice.  
4.4.1.  Many of the prerequisites for good bridge resource management had been met before the 
pilotage act began.  Unlike most  acts of pilotage , where a pilot boards a ship and begins 
piloting almost immediately, t he pilot had been on board the L'Austral  for two days .  He had 
worked with the bridge team during  several acts of pilotage within Fiordland and had  had the 
opportunity to become familiar with the bridge equipme nt. 
4.4.2.  The pilot and the vessel's bridge team were working from the same passage plan, which 
closely followed the passage plan prescribed in the Fiordland Pilots Standard Operating 
Procedures .  From the data downloaded from the voyage data recorder  it can be heard that 
when the pilot c ame onto the bridge before taking the con of  the L'Austral there was positive 
engagement between the bridge team and the pilot . 
4.4.3.  The master/pilot information exchange was carried out in good time and included the officer 
of the wa tch, who was in audible range .  The information exchange was carried out prior to 
entering each fiord and the proposed route was discussed and agreed upon.  The master , pilot 
and bridge team all shared a common understanding of the route to be taken.  The pilot was 
heard to reiterate that he "welcomed questions and challenges on any aspect ". 
4.4.4.  As part of the master/pilot information exchange , an accurately completed pilot information 
card (see Appendix 2)  provides the pilot with much of  the essential information he requires for 
the passage and any manoeuvres that may be carried out.  This information can be 
supplemente d by discussion s with the master and bridge team.  A cop y of the International 
Chamber of Shipping's Bridge Procedures Guide Annex A2 is provided  in Appendix 6; it can be

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 considered industry good practice  and follows the recommendations of IMO Resolution 
A.601(15) , Provision and Display of Manoeuvring Information on Board Ships. 
4.4.5.  Nevertheless, the grounding  still occurred .  In the lead -up to the grounding , one of the key 
elements  was absent, that of challenge and response.  As the L'Austral deviated south of the 
agreed track nobody on the navigating bridg e verbally questioned the pilot as to his intentions , 
at a time when he had lost situational awareness and most needed an intervention or 
challenge from the crew.  
4.4.6.  The officer of the watch  was monitoring the vessel 's position  and realised that the vessel wa s 
straying from the agreed track .  However,  he was not confident enough to question the pilot 
when the master was also on the bridge.  
4.4.7.  On 9 January 2017, o ne month before this accident , the L'Austral had been  involved in 
another accident when it struck an uncharted rock while  being manoeuvred close inshore 
around  the sub-Antarctic Snares Islands .  The master had had the con of the vessel  and 
another officer of the watch  indicated she had not been confident questioning the master 's 
instructions . 
4.4.8.  This and the previous accident indicate d that putting effective bridge resource management  
into practi ce was not routine.  With at least two watch -keeping officers on board showing a 
reluctan ce to question the master, any intervention on the pilot's actions  was effectively left  to 
the master.    
4.4.9.  However, the master did not  intervene when the pilot lost situational awareness, except  to 
gestur e in the dark  that the ship should be further to port .  In his submission on the draft 
report, the master commented that  he had had every confidence in the pilot and that it "would 
not [have been] appropriate for him to override the pilot's command ".  Leaving  any 
intervention to when the ship had deviated so far off course that it was about to strike the 
shoreline is an ind ication that the concept of bridge resource management was not fully 
understood.   The objective of bridge resource management is to achieve safe navigation and 
not allow a situation to develop to the point where the communication is centred on 
minimising t he damage once a grounding has become inevitable.  
4.4.10.  Subordinate officers being reluctant to question a superior or the person in command or 
control of a ship is symptomatic of what is often referred to a s a 'power -distance relationship '.  
Such a relationship  is a deterrent to subordinates challeng ing the actions of a superior, even if 
those actions or inactions are detrimental to the safe navigation of the ship.  A power -distance 
relationship is a major threat to the performance of a bridge team . 
4.4.11.  In its repor t on the previous grounding involving the  L'Austral , the Commission recommended  
that the operator review its safety management system to ensure a better standard of bridge 
resource management  on board.  The recommendation is equally applicable to this accident.  
4.4.12.  The Commission has found poor bridge resource management under pilotage to be  a factor 
contributing to accidents involving two other ships in New Zealand22.  The reports make 
several recommendations aimed at improving the standard of pilotage and making the 
transition of a pilot into a ship's bridge team seamless.  
Finding  
8. At the time of this and a previous accident , the reluctance of the bridge 
team to question the person in command or control of the ship  was 
preventing effective  challenge and response, a fundamental aspect of good 
bridge resource management.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The L'Austral  made contact with the shoreline while making a turn in Milford Sound because 
the harbour pilot lost situational awareness as to where the ship was, where it was heading, 
and what other factors were influencing its progress.  
5.2. The master and officer of the w atch both noticed that the L'Austral  had deviated substantially 
from the planned track, but neither spoke up until it was too late to prevent the ship grounding 
near the shoreline.  
5.3. The planned track for the pilotage into Milford Sound was appropriate and a greed by all 
persons in the bridge team.  However, there was no discussion on how the conduct of the 
pilotage would be undertaken and how far from the planned track the ship would be allowed 
to deviate.  
5.4. The bridge team agreeing to use a rate -of-turn method  for conducting the pilotage when the 
rate-of-turn-indic ator on board  the L'Austral  was faulty was likely a factor contributing to the 
accident.  
5.5. The ship's crew were not totally familiar with, and did not use all of the safety features of the 
ECDIS, the sh ip's primary electronic navigation system.  
5.6. The darkness and absence of visual navigation aids outside the ship meant that the bridge 
team were totally reliant on the ship's electronic navigation aids and systems (referred to as 
blind pilotage).  However, t he bridge team were not making full use of the available equipment 
to ensure  that the ship stayed on track.  
5.7. Environment Southland had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the risk of large ships 
having to conduct blind pilotage in the confined waters of  Fiordland.  
5.8. At the time of this and a previous accident , the reluctance of the bridge team to question the 
person in command or control of the ship  was preventing effective  challenge and response, a 
fundamental aspect of good bridge resource management.

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 6. Safety issues  
6.1. The primary means for navigation on board the L'Austral , the ECDIS, was not being used to its 
full potential as a tool for planning and monitoring the ship's passage, and the crew were not 
fully conversant with its safety features.   
6.2. The stand ard of bridge resource management on board the L'Austral  during the Milford Sound 
pilotage did not meet good industry practice.  
6.3. Conducting blind pilotage with large ships in confined waters represent ed risks that had not 
been fully considered by Environment Southland, the regional authority that regulates 
maritime activity in the area .

 7. Safety actions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues i dentified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Since the accident Environment Southland has:  
 required all Fiordland pilots to have completed, within the past three years, refresher blind 
pilotage training as a prerequisite to any hours -of-darkness pilotage  
 programmed a general navigation safety assessment of the increasing number of visiting 
cruise ships to Fiordland, to include hours -of-darkness pilotage and the provision of extra 
navigational aids.   
7.3. Since t he accident Port Otago , as the parent company of Fiordland Pilot Services , has: 
 sent all its Fiordland pilots on a three -day blind pilotage refresher training course, with two 
days focusing on Milford Sound and other passages in Fiordland and one day focus ing on 
blind pilotage in Stewart Island  
 issued the pilots with their own portable pilotage units23 loaded with the appropriate 
charts for Fiordland and Stewart Island.   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.4. Since the accident the ship operator has sent an email to all masters informing them of the 
recommendations and lessons learnt from this incident:  
 The Master is in command of the ship at all times with only one exception: when transiting 
through the Panama Canal.  Therefore, it is always the duty  of the Master and officer of 
the watch to keep a situational awareness of all activities of the pilot.  Although the pilot is 
most knowledgeable about local waters, it is the responsibility of the Master/officer of the 
watch to verify position through pro per use of charts, radars and other position fixing 
devices and follow local rules on speed and routing.  
 Voyage planning is crucial in all situations including when pilots are on board.  Sufficient 
time should be allowed for proper communication between t he Master, pilots and officer 
of the watches. This voyage plan should include every important activity starting from the 
embarkation of the pilot, in and out of the berth, and finally the disembarkation of the 
pilot.  
 If the pilot is to command tugs and/or  personnel at a berth in a language that is foreign to 
the crew, the Master must demand that the pilot communicates with the Master and/or 
officer of the watch in a common language.  
 When the piloted voyage is taking the vessel through narrow waters, you sh ould mark 
"wheel -over" points either on the chart or at the radar screen in order to know when you 
are reaching "points of no return".  This helps to allow the pilot, Master, and/or officer of 
the watch to keep a better situational awareness.  
 The ship's c rew is normally the most knowledgeable regarding the manoeuvring 
capabilities of the ship.  Detailed descriptions of the ship's manoeuvring characteristics 
should be communicated during the voyage planning stage.  In addition, the Master 
                                                        
23 Compact , portable electronic display system s that give easy access to relevant navigational information, 
including charted data, and may include access to local real -time data . 
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -202 and/or officer of the watch should communicate manoeuvring capabilities during the 
voyage, as necessary.  The Master and officer of the watch should never feel hesitant to 
discuss these matters with the pilot if they feel it necessary to do so.  
 Ensure that the vessel is eq uipped with the necessary updated charts for the intended 
voyage.  It is not sufficient to rely on the pilot to provide this information.   
 The officer of the watch should always closely monitor the activities of the pilot. Many 
times, the pilot will not n ecessarily communicate with the officer of the watch regarding 
the vessel and/or voyage.  The officer of the watch should not hesitate to communicate 
with the pilot on any relevant matters regarding the vessel or the voyage.   
 The officer of the watch should not only be diligent with regard to his duties to ensure the 
pilot's orders are properly followed but also to monitor the pilot's activities.  If the officer 
of the watch has concerns regarding the pilot's activities, he sho uld contact the Master 
immediately.  
 The vessel should have clear procedures and instructions to Masters and officer s of the 
watch on what to do with a pilot on board.  These should be included as part of the ship 
safety management system (SMS).  
 Bridge res ource management  is an important activity to ensure safety.  Any bridge 
resource management  training should include how to handle the change in 
communication, command, and control when a pilot takes over navigation of the ship.  
7.5. In addition to the email , the ship operator forwarded a publication produced by the P&I Club, 
Gard AS24, that provided guidance to masters on the relationship between the pilot and the 
bridge team.

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to the operator and Environment 
Southland.  
8.2. In the interests of transport  safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future. 
Previous r ecommendations  
To the operator  
8.3. The Commission investigated a previous grounding involving the L'Austral  when the ship was 
manoeuvring close to the shore while retrieving the ship's rigid -hulled inflatable boats . 
8.4. The recommendations considere d that:  
 the portion of the voyage plan to recover the ship's rigid -hulled inflatable boats was not 
well planned in accordance with the IMO standards and the guidelines given in leading 
industry publications  
 the L'Austral  inadvertently encroached an exclusion zone and an area the master had 
intended to avoid because the ship's position was not being adequately monitored  
 the standard of bridge resource management on board  the L'Austral  did not meet good 
industry practice.  
On 28 February 2018  the Commission recommended that the Directeur D'exploitation at 
Ponant review the safety management system on board  the L'Austral  and upgrade it to ensure 
that the standards of voyage planning, standards of navigation and level of bridge  resource 
management meet the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation and follow the 
guidelines in leading industry publications. ( 002/18 ) 
On 15 March 2018, Ponant replied, in part:  
Ponant's Voyage Planning procedure was reviewed on 15 Dece mber 2017. This new 
procedure has been communicated to all Captains.  
Specific BRM training sessions provided by the French Marine Academy have been 
rolled out, starting from January 2017. To date 21 Ponant officers have undergone 
the training, 13 more are scheduled to undergo this training in 2018.  
8.5. Taking into consideration that:  
 the operator's system for providing and managing the provision of  an ECDIS on board the 
L'Austral  did not meet the intent of the IMO standards  
 the ECDIS was the primary means of navigation on board  the L'Austral , yet the operating 
crew were not fully familiar with the capabilities and the limitations of the equipment, and 
were not making best use of it . 
On 28 February 2018  the Commission recommended that the Directeur D'exploitati on at 
Ponant review the procedures for the setting up, training  in and ongoing support for ECDIS s on 
all of its ships, and ensure that all comply with mandatory requirements and that the ships ' 
crews are fully conversant with good industry practice for the use of ECDIS s. (003/18 ) 
On 15 March 2018, Ponant replied, in part:  
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -202 Ponant has also started obtaining additional ECDIS training session program for its 
officers. Eleven officers received this t raining in 2016 and 2017 and we plan to train 
15 more during 2018.  
We also plan to develop a specific Ponant's ECDIS training with e -learning methods, 
we are in the process of researching the best way of doing this. We intend to 
complete this by the end of  2018. We will provide TAIC with an update once we have 
completed this internal training program.  
New recommendations  
To the Chief Executive of Environment Southland  
8.6. Environment Southland manages navigational safety within the Fiordland region and is 
commi tted to undertak ing and regulat ing marine operations for cruise ships within its area.  
The increasing frequency, scale and duration of cruise ship traffic through Fiordland will 
increase the risk s.  Milford Sound is not the only passage where blind pilota ge can be a 
necessity.  
There are a number of measures  that the regional council  could take to better manage the 
risks to navigation safety within Fiordland, including : the provision of more navigation aids; 
better training and currency for pilots in blind pilotage techniques; and even prohibiting night 
navigation of certain passages if that were  felt necessary.  
On 22 June  2018  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of Environment 
Southland review the risk assessment for safe navigation within Fiordland and take the 
necessary action (s) to mitigate the risk of large cruise ships frequently transiting narrow 
passages with limited room for manoeuvring and with p ilots on board during the hours of 
darkness or in other conditions of restricted visibility . [017/18]  
On 6 July 2018 , the Chief Executive of Environment Southland replied:  
Environment Southland is committed to ensuring that its navigation safety 
responsibilities for Fiordland and the Southland region as a whole are managed 
appropriately.  
Navigatus Consulting have been contacted by Environment Southland to provide an 
overall risk assessment of the increasing number of cruise ships scheduled to visi t 
Fiordland; this risk assessment is due for completion 31 July.  
Dependant upon the outcome of the cruise ship risk assessment, further work may 
be required to be undertaken to properly address the final recommendations from 
the Commission.  
It is envisaged  that Council will be in a position to confirm by 30 September 2018, 
whether or not they have been able to fully implement the final recommendations.  
  
 
Final Report MO -2017 -202 
<< Page 27 >>
 9. Key l essons  
9.1. A ship's passage plan is more than just the planned track for the ship to follow.  Every par t of a 
ship's voyage must be planned and all members of the bridge team be fully familiar with and 
agree to the plan. This is a cornerstone of good bridge resource management.  
9.2. Good bridge resource management relies on a culture where challenge is welcomed and 
responded to, regardless of rank, personality or nationality . 
9.3. ECDIS is a valuable aid to navigation.  However, mariners need to fully understand and be 
familiar with all aspects of the system, particularly when using it for blind pilotage.

Charts NZ7622 "Milford Sound to Sutherland Sound", and NZ7621 "Milford Sound"  
 
For vessels arriving from overseas the pilot will board  about 2 -3 miles WNW of Saint Anne 
Point or in a position mutually agreed by  radio.  
 
Fishing floats may be encountered in the approaches to Milford Sound.  
 
Approaching Dale Point a convenient "wheel -over" point may be with Dale Point and Copper 
Point in transit. At 10 knots a rate of turn of 10 degrees per minute is recommended, but the 
rate of turn and position must be constantly monitored a s the vessel may be deflected from her 
intended track, especially in northerly winds. Wind shear may be experienced rounding Dale 
Point and accelerated wind speeds are common between Dale Point and Copper Point. Once 
past Copper Point, the vessel may depar t from the indicated track for sightseeing, but always 
remembering that local tourist vessels navigate within the Sound in a clockwise direct ion i.e. 
they keep to the port side. Kayakers and other recreational users may also be encountered.  
 
The effect of the "Day Breeze", generally encountered in Milford Sound during the afternoon, 
must be taken into account, especially if it is intended to stop to embark/disembark passengers. 
Milford Port Control may be contacted on VHF 14.

Guidelines for Voyage Planning  
1 Prior to proceeding to sea, the master shall ensure that the intended voyage has been 
planned using the appropriate nautical charts and nautical publications for the area 
concerned, taking into account the guidelines and recommendations d eveloped by the 
Organizatio n* 
2 The voyage plan shall identify a route which:  
.1 takes into account any relevant ships' routeing systems;  
.2 ensures sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage;  
.3 anticipates all known navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions; and  
.4 takes into account the marine environmental protection measures that apply, and avoids, 
as far as possible, actions and activities which could cause damage to the environment.  
Resolution A 893(21) Annex  
DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR VOYAGE PLANNING  
1. Objective  
1.1 The development of a plan for voyage or passage, as well as the close and continuous 
monitoring of the vessel's progress and position during the execution of such a plan, are of 
essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navig ation and 
protection of the marine environment.  
1.2  The need for voyage and passage planning applies to all vessels. There are several factors 
that may impede the safe navigation of all vessels and additional factors that may impede 
the navigation of lar ge vessels or vessels carrying hazardous cargoes. These factors will 
need to be taken into account in the preparation of the plan and in the subsequent 
monitoring of the execution of the plan.  
1.3  Voyage and passage planning includes appraisal, i.e. gathe ring all information relevant to 
the contemplated voyage or passage; detailed planning of the whole voyage or passage 
from berth to berth, including those areas necessitating the presence of a pilot; execution 
of the plan; and the monitoring of the progres s of the vessel in the implementation of the 
plan. These components of voyage/passage planning are analysed below.  
 
2. Appraisal  
2.1 All information relevant to the contemplated voyage or passage should be considered. The 
following items should be taken into account in voyage and passage planning:  
1. .1 the condition and state of the vessel, its stability, and its equipment; any operational 
limitations; its permissible draught at sea in fairways25 and in ports; its manoeuvring

 5. .5 appropriate scale, accurate and up -to-date charts to be used for the intended voyage 
or passage, as well as any relevant permanent or temporary notices to marin ers and 
existing radio navigational warnings;  
6. .6 accurate and up -to-date sailing directions, lists of lights and lists of radio aids to 
navigation; and  
7. .7 any relevant up -to-date additional information, including:  
.1 mariners' routeing guides and passage  planning charts, published by competent 
authorities;  
.2 current and tidal atlases and tide tables;  
.3 climatological, hydrographical, and oceanographic data as well as other appropriate 
meteorological information;  
.4 availability of services for weather routeing (such as that contained in Volume D of 
the World Meteorological Organization's Publication No. 9);  
.5 existing ships' routeing and reporting systems, vessel traffic services, and marine 
environmental protec tion measures;  
.6 volume of traffic likely to be encountered throughout the voyage or passage;  
.7 if a pilot is to be used, information relating to pilotage and embarkation and 
disembarkation including the exchange of information between master and pilot ;  
.8 available port information, including information pertaining to the availability of 
shore -based emergency response arrangements and equipment; and  
.9 any additional items pertinent to the type of the vessel or its cargo, the particular 
areas the ves sel will traverse, and the type of voyage or passage to be undertaken.  
2.2  On the basis of the above information, an overall appraisal of the intended voyage or 
passage should be made. This appraisal should provide a clear indication of all areas of 
dang er; those areas where it will be possible to navigate safely, including any existing 
routeing or reporting systems and vessel traffic services; and any areas where marine 
environmental protection considerations apply.  
3. Planning  
3.1 On the basis of the fulle st possible appraisal, a detailed voyage or passage plan should be 
prepared which should cover the entire voyage or passage from berth to berth, including 
those areas where the services of a pilot will be used.  
3.2  The detailed voyage or passage plan shou ld include the following factors:  
8. .1 the plotting of the intended route or track of the voyage or passage on appropriate 
scale charts: the true direction of the planned route or track should be indicated, as well 
as all areas of danger, existing ships' rou teing and reporting systems, vessel traffic 
services, and any areas where marine environmental protection considerations apply;  
9. .2 the main elements to ensure safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation, 
and protection of the marine environ ment during the intended voyage or passage; such 
elements should include, but not be limited to:  
.1 safe speed, having regard to the proximity of navigational hazards along the intended 
route or track, the manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel and its draught in 
relation to the available water depth;  
.2 necessary speed alterations en route, e.g., where there may be limitations because of 
night passage, tidal restrictions, or allowance for the increase of draught due to 
squat and heel effect when turnin g;  
.3 minimum clearance required under the keel in critical areas with restricted water 
depth;  
.4 positions where a change in machinery status is required;  
.5 course alteration points, taking into account the vessel's turning circle at the planned 
speed  and any expected effect of tidal streams and currents;  
.6 the method and frequency of position fixing, including primary and secondary 
options, and the indication of areas where accuracy of position fixing is critical and 
where maximum reliability must be obtained;  
.7 use of ships' routeing and reporting syst ems and vessel traffic services;  
.8 considerations relating to the protection of the marine environment; and  
.9 contingency plans for alternative action to place the vessel in deep water or proceed 
to a port of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of an y emergency necessitating 
abandonment of the plan, taking into account existing shore -based emergency

 Final Report MO -2017 -202 response arrangements and equipment and the nature of the cargo and of the 
emergency itself.  
3.3 The details of the voyage or passage plan should be clear ly marked and recorded, as 
appropriate, on charts and in a voyage plan notebook or computer disk.  
3.4  Each voyage or passage plan as well as the details of the plan, should be approved by the 
ships' master prior to the commencement of the voyage or passa ge. 
4. Execution  
4.1  Having finalized the voyage or passage plan, as soon as time of departure and estimated 
time of arrival can be determined with reasonable accuracy, the voyage or passage should 
be executed in accordance with the plan or any changes made thereto.  
4.2  Factors which should be taken into account when executing the plan, or deciding on any 
departure therefrom include:  
.1 the reliability and condition of the vessel's navigational equipment;  
.2 estimated times of arrival at critical points fo r tide heights and flow;  
.3 meteorological conditions, (particularly in areas known to be affected by frequent 
periods of low visibility) as well as weather routeing information;  
.4 daytime versus night -time passing of danger points, and any effect this may have on 
position fixing accuracy; and  
.5 traffic conditions, especially at navigational focal points.  
4.3  It is important for the master to consider whether any particular circumstance, such as the 
forecast of restricted visibility in an area where p osition fixing by visual means at a critical 
point is an essential feature of the voyage or passage plan, introduces an unacceptable 
hazard to the safe conduct of the passage; and thus whether that section of the passage 
should be attempted under the condi tions prevailing or likely to prevail. The master should 
also consider at which specific points of the voyage or passage there may be a need to 
utilize additional deck or engine room personnel.  
5. Monitoring  
5.1  The plan should be available at all times on t he bridge to allow officers of the navigational 
watch immediate access and reference to the details of the plan.  
5.2  The progress of the vessel in accordance with the voyage and passage plan should be 
closely and continuously monitored. Any changes made to the plan should be made 
consistent with these Guidelines and clearly marked and recorded.
