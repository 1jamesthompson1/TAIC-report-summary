"2013_106","[7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15]","40.0","The train controller's performance was highly likely impaired by fatigue at the time of the incident, as concluded by the sleep expert and clinical psychologist (4.4.13, 4.6.1). The train controller had been working a roster that did not provide sufficient opportunity to recover from sleep debt (4.3.3-4.3.5, 4.4.2-4.4.12). This fatigue was likely a result of cumulative sleep debt due to insufficient opportunities to recover from previous periods of work and possibly exacerbated by a circadian-related increase in sleepiness (4.4.13). KiwiRail's train control roster did not allow sufficient opportunity for the train controller to recover from any sleep debt incurred during shift cycles (5.3).
","0.0","30.0","The train controller made an assumption that the train had already passed the signals technician's location, which did not comply with KiwiRail rules and created a significant risk (5.2). The train controller's error was due to not verifying the exact location of the train before authorizing the track occupation (4.2.6). This assumption was based on a local practice and previous experiences with technicians providing additional information about train locations (4.2.7). The Commission had previously identified the safety issue of train controllers acting on assumptions and the need for track occupations to be authorized on verified information only (4.2.10).
","0.0","10.0","While the document does not explicitly mention inadequate training as a direct cause, the train controller's familiarity with previous technicians who offered additional information suggests a reliance on informal practices rather than strict adherence to training and competency protocols (4.2.7). Additionally, KiwiRail addressed the safety issue by introducing new track occupation procedures after the incident, indicating that there may have been gaps in training and competency that needed to be addressed (4.2.11).
","0.0","0.0","There is no information in the document that suggests a lack of training or familiarity with equipment contributed to the incident.
","0.0","5.0","The train driver's actions, based on good crew resource management principles, averted an accident by overhearing the track occupation being authorized and acting accordingly (4.2.9). This indicates that while CRM played a role in preventing the accident, it was not a contributing factor to the cause of the incident.
","0.0","10.0","The train controller did not adhere to KiwiRail's safety procedures by failing to check the train's location before authorizing the track occupation (4.2.6). This non-compliance with safety procedures directly contributed to the creation of the potential for a head-on collision (5.1).
","0.0","5.0","The train controller had been involved in three operating irregularities during the previous 16 months, and KiwiRail had identified his having concentration and focus issues but allowed him to continue in the role (4.7.1). This suggests that KiwiRail's safety culture may not have been sufficiently proactive in addressing known performance issues that could affect safety (4.7.5).
