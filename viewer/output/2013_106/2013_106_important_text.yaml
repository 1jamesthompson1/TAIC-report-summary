  \ should help to prevent  mistakes by train controllers resulting in \naccidents\
  \ and incidents.   The following analysis discusses what went wrong for the train\
  \ \ncontroller when he  set up the conflict between the train and the work vehicles.\
  \  \n4.1.2.  The analysis also considers the circumstances that contributed to the\
  \ train controller's error.  \nTwo safety issues are discussed.  \n1. The train\
  \ controller's shift pattern  and how this likely contributed to his performance\
  \ \nbeing affected by fatigue at the time of the incident.  \n2. Other human factors\
  \ (known to KiwiRail) that probably contributed to the train controller \nbeing\
  \ fatigued at the time of the incident, and specifically how these were being managed\
  \ \nby KiwiRail.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The train controller was fully\
  \ aware of the testing work  underway on the Otira Tunnel  door \nsystems.  It had\
  \ been included in the daily infor mation bulletin and the train controller had\
  \ \nbeen briefed on the activity by the outgoing train controller during the handover\
  \ at the start of \nhis shift.  \n4.2.2.  The train controller was aware of the\
  \ presence and movement of the train right up to the time \nthat he authorised the\
  \ signals technician to occupy the same section of track ne ar the western \nportal\
  \ of the Otira T unnel.  \n4.2.3.  The train controller had set the departure signal\
  \ to green to allow the train to depart the Otira \nstation  and then  he had seen\
  \ the train leav e the Otira station on the signalling mimic screen  \nat his workstation\
  \ .  He had updated its progress on the train control diagram.  He was \nsupposed\
  \ to have endorsed the train control diagram with the actual time in minutes , but\
  \ \nomitted to do so .  Train cont rollers are required to record departure time\
  \ s in minutes as a \npermanent visual reference.  This allows them to go back and\
  \ view a train's last known time \nand location when considering requests for later\
  \ track occupations.  \n4.2.4.  It was unlikely that omitting to record the departure\
  \ time of the train from Otira contributed to \nthis incident, because it was only\
  \ one minute later that the train controller authorised the \nsignals technician\
  \ to occupy the section of track in front of the train.  Nevertheless, it was the\
  \  \nfirst of a series of omissions by the train controller.  \n4.2.5.  The audio\
  \ recording of the train control workstation  revealed that the train controller\
  \ was not \nunder a heavy workload at the time.  It also revealed that there were\
  \ no other radio calls from \nother p arties and no other sources of distraction\
  \ d uring the one -minute period between his  \nlast acknowledgement of the train\
  \ 's location  and authorising the track occupation ahead of \nthe train.  \n4.2.6.\
  \  The next omission by the train controller was not verifying the exact location\
  \ of the train before \nauthorising the track occupation within the same section\
  \ of track, as he was required to do by \nKiwiRail 's rules.  Instead he acted on\
  \ an assumption that the train had already entered the \nOtira Tunnel and was clear\
  \ of the western portal, based purely on the fact that the signals \ntechnician\
  \ had requested the track occupation.  \n4.2.7.  The signals technician followed\
  \ the requirements of KiwiRail's Rule 915 when he requested \nthe track occupation\
  \ from the train controller.   However, he w as new to the area, and the train \n\
  controller had become accustomed to previous technicians offering additional information\
  \ \nabout the location s of trains in the area . \n4.2.8.  The train controller\
  \ could easily have verified the exact location of the train by any one or more\
  \ \nof the following means:  \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -106 \uF0B7\
  \ contacting the train driver and asking where his train was  \n\uF0B7 asking the\
  \ signals technician if the train had passed over the bridge and entered the \n\
  tunnel  \n\uF0B7 check ing on his mimic screen to see whether the tunnel door indicator\
  \ was showing open \nor closed . \n4.2.9.  The train was less than 3 km  from Bridge\
  \ 50 when the signals technician drove the first of two \nvehicles on  to the track\
  \ with the intention of crossing the bridge.  It is fortuitous that the train \n\
  driver overheard the track occupation being authorised and he followed the principles\
  \ of good \ncrew resource management to avert an accident.  \n4.2.10.  The Commission\
  \  has previously identified and commented on the safety issue of train \ncontrollers\
  \ acting on assumptions.  It made a finding in its Paerata report1 that KiwiRail\
  \ must \ntake all available steps to ensure that train controllers did not act on\
  \ assumptions  and that \ntrain controllers must authorise track o ccupations on\
  \ verified information only.  \n4.2.11.  KiwiRail  addressed this safety issue by\
  \ introduc ing new track occupation procedures seven \nweeks  after  this incident\
  \ (refer to the \"Safety actions \" section of this report).  Train controllers\
  \ \nare now prohibited from authorising track occupations while train s are  occupying\
  \ section s \nbetween stations in which the track occupation s have been requested.\
  \  The new procedures \napplied from 1 August 2013.  \nFindings \n1. The train controller\
  \  inadvertently created  the potential for a head -on collision  when \nhe authorised\
  \ the work vehicles to cross the rail bridge in the path of the \napproaching train.\
  \  He did so without first checking the location of the train as he \nwas required\
  \ to by KiwiRail 's rules.  \n2. A local practice  had evolved over time whereby\
  \ maintenance staff would normally \nnot request time on track before any trains\
  \ known to them in their location had \npassed.  Acting on that local procedure,\
  \ t he train controller made an assumption \nthat the train had already passed the\
  \ signals technician's  location .  This \nassumption  by the train controller did\
  \ not comply with the KiwiRail rules and \ncreated a significant risk to the safety\
  \ of the track maintenance and train staff.  \n4.3. Train control roster and fatigue\
  \  \nSafety issue - The standard roster that the train controller was working in\
  \ the weeks leading \nup to the incident did not offer the train controller sufficient\
  \ opportunity to recover from any \nsleep debt incurred after a shif t cycle.  \n\
  4.3.1.  The train controller had been working in the role for more than six years.\
  \  He said that he \nhadn't been sleeping well in the 18 months leading up to the\
  \ incident  and was feeling more \npressured and stressed in relation to work shifts\
  \ that he had pr eviously completed without \ndifficulty .  He added that his \"\
  sleep quality had never been that good \" despite hi s \"trying hard \nto sleep\"\
  \ and that he had only been able to achieve normal sleep during his complete (24\
  \ -\nhour) days off duty .  He also added that hi s wife had noticed that he wasn't\
  \ sleeping or resting \nand that he was tired.  \n4.3.2.  The train controller said\
  \ that in the eight weeks leading up to the incident he probably \nachieved a good\
  \ night's sleep on only 14 of the 56 day s.  A review of his roster showed th at\
  \ \nthere had been  only five off -duty periods whe n he had two complete days off\
  \ duty that gave \nhim the opportunity  to achieve two consecutive full nights of\
  \ sleep.  \n                                                        \n1 Commission\
  \ report 11 -106, hi -rail vehicle nearly struck by passenger train, Crown Road\
  \ level crossing, \nPaerata, 28 November 2011.  \nFinal report RO -2013 -106 \n\
  << Page 9 >>\n 4.3.3.  Given the train controller's comments, and his performance\
  \ and circumstances leading up to \nthe incident, the Commission reviewed his medical\
  \ history and engaged an expert in sleep \nresearch to review the train controller\
  \ 's shift pattern.  Appendix 1 gives a description of the \nterminology used by\
  \ the sleep expert.  \n4.3.4.  The clinical psychologist said that on current formal\
  \ testing there were some indications of \npossible subtle compromise in the train\
  \ controller 's initial processing of verbally presented \ninformation.  \n4.3.5.\
  \  The clinical psychologist concluded that cumulative sleep deprivation over a\
  \ long perio d of \ntime was a likely cause of the train controller 's having brief\
  \ moments of reduced alertness.  \nThe psychologist noted that the train controller\
  \ had had less than 48 hours ' time off duty \nwhen he changed from his night shift\
  \ week at 0700 on 8 June 2013 a nd resumed working at \n1500 on 9 June 2013.  The\
  \ train controller's circadian rhythm would have been significantly \ndisrupted\
  \  by this . \n4.4. Opinion of the sleep expert  \n4.4.1.  Referring to the train\
  \ controller's shift roster, t he sleep expert said that given the timing o f the\
  \ \nincident, the likely length of prior wakefulness experienced by the train controller\
  \ would have \nbeen 7 \xBD hours.  This was unlikely to have resulted in short -term\
  \ fatigue -related performance \nimpairments.  The 40-minute period on duty prior\
  \ to the incident and the moderate workload \nduring this time would not have contributed\
  \ to any time -on-task/workload -related performance \ndecrements.  \n4.4.2.  However,\
  \ o pportunities for recovery from any potential cumulative sleep debt d id not\
  \ occur \nfrequently in the shift pattern  in the eight weeks leading up to the\
  \ incident .  There was also \nthe potential for a cumulative sleep debt to accrue\
  \ in this roster , and not only when night \nshifts were worked.  The relatively\
  \ early start of the day shift at 0650 would, for most people, \ntruncate night\
  \ -time sleep.  \n4.4.3.  It is difficult for an individual to go to bed early in\
  \ an effort to extend their sleep when working \nearly starting shifts  due to the\
  \ circadian drive for wakefulness in the evening .  Evening shifts, \nwhich end\
  \ at 2300, may also shorten sleep by delaying bedtime, although this very much \n\
  depends on whether an individual is able to sleep for longer the following morning.\
  \  \n4.4.4.  In the month prior to the incident (from 7 May onwards) the potential\
  \ for a cumulative slee p \ndebt to develop was high.  This period began with 10\
  \ consecutive days of work and, although \nthis period did not include night shifts,\
  \ the long run of early starts and late finishes of the day \nand evening shifts\
  \ respectively could have restricted sleep.  After three days off the train \ncontroller\
  \ worked five consecutive night shifts, and the requirement to sleep during the\
  \ day \nwas highly likely to result in the train controller obtaining less sleep\
  \ and poorer -quality sleep \nthan usual.  \n4.4.5.  Subsequent to these ni ght\
  \ shifts the train controller was rostered for two days off (25  and 26 \nMay).\
  \  However, the preceding night shift finished on the morning of the first day off\
  \ and the \nfirst day shift after the second night off require d a relatively early\
  \ start , possibly truncating this \nsleep episode.  This limited period of time\
  \ off is unlikely to have provided  him with  sufficient \ntime to recover from\
  \ the preceding night shifts.  \n4.4.6.  This was followed by four day shifts (starting\
  \ relatively early) then four days off.   The early -\nstarting day shifts could\
  \ have added to any existing sleep debt , and when a sleep debt is \nallowed to\
  \ occur and accrue, three to five days of recovery have been shown to be insufficient\
  \ \nto return performance back to baseline  (refer to Appendix 1  for more detail)\
  \ . \n4.4.7.  The four days off were followed by another series of consecutive night\
  \ shifts (4  to 7 June) and \nagain the daytime sleep was likely to have been  shorter\
  \ and of poorer quality than usual.  The \ntrain controller stated that he usually\
  \ obtain ed seven to eight hours of sleep at night and he \nwas able to obtain between\
  \ six and seven hours of sleep during the day from 5 to 7 June.   This \nsleep was\
  \ obtained in two blocks of approximately three  hours.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final\
  \ report RO -2013 -106 4.4.8.  There is presently little known about the restora\
  \ tive value of split sleep when sleep occurs \nduring the biological day, therefore\
  \ it cannot be determined whether splitting sleep into two \nrelatively equal blocks\
  \ would be better or worse than a single block of daytime sleep (or some \nother\
  \ split -sleep arran gement).  However, based on the amount of sleep obtained, the\
  \ train \ncontroller would have accumulated a sleep debt of between 1 \xBD and 4\xBD\
  \ hours across the four \nconsecutive night shifts (i.e. he obtained 1 \xBD to 4\xBD\
  \ hours less sleep than normally required \nacross  these four days).  This sleep\
  \ was also likely to have been  of poorer quality  and contain \na greater number\
  \ of awakenings than usual night -time sleep , and thus be less restorative.  \n\
  4.4.9.  The 32 -hour break prior to the evening shifts commencing would not have\
  \ provided him with \nsufficient opportunity to recover from any accumulated sleep\
  \ debt accrued up until that point \nin time.  The train controller slept for 12\
  \ hours during this time ( one block of three hours \nduring the day and a nine-hour\
  \ period of sleep at night).  \n4.4.10.  Previous research has shown that a 10-hour\
  \ period of sleep following five nights of restricted \nsleep does  not allow reaction\
  \ time performance and subjective estimates of sleepin ess and \nfatigue to recover.\
  \  In the present situation, the night -time sleep opportunity was also likely to\
  \ \nhave been  less than ideal due to the disruption of the circadian biological\
  \ clock in conjunction \nwith the previous night shifts.  \n4.4.11.  The train controller\
  \  then obtained another eight -hour period of night -time sleep prior to \ncommencing\
  \ his second evening shift , which commenced slightly later than the train \ncontroller's\
  \ usual bedtime due to the finish time of the evening shift.  If a significant sleep\
  \ \ndebt ha d accrued, these two night -time sleep periods (on 8  and 9 June) would\
  \ have been  \nunlikely to  provide  him with  sufficient opportunity to recover\
  \  fully. \n4.4.12.  The incident occurred at 1530, a point in the cycle of the\
  \ circadian biological clock where \nsleepiness inc reases (also known as the afternoon\
  \ nap window).  This increased sleepiness \ncould well  have  added to any existing\
  \ fatigue caused by a cumulative sleep debt.   The incident \ninvolved a failure\
  \ of attentional processes by the train controller.  This type of pe rformance \n\
  error is consistent with the behaviour expected of a fatigued individual.  \n4.4.13.\
  \  The sleep expert concluded that it was \"highly likely that the per formance\
  \ of the train \ncontroller was impaired by fa tigue \" and that \" the fatigue\
  \  was likely to have resulted from a \ncumulative sleep debt due to insufficient\
  \ opportunities to recover from previous periods of \nwork and was possibly exacerbated\
  \ by a circadian -related increase in sleepiness (the \nafternoon nap window). \
  \ The effectiveness o f prior recovery periods during the eight  weeks \nleading\
  \ up to the incident may have been reduced by sleep difficulties experienced by\
  \ the \nindividual \". \n4.4.14.  The sleep expert acknowledged that fatigue is\
  \ \"inevitable in any occupation where individuals \nare required to work when they\
  \ would normally be asleep.  Therefore a shift work environment \nwill always be\
  \ a matter of minimising rather than eliminating fatigue\".  She also said that\
  \ \n\"changing a roster system is only one way in which fatigue can be better ma\
  \ naged in a shift \nenvironment.  Because of individual differences and preferences\
  \ there will never be a perfect \nroster in an environment where 24 -hour operations\
  \ are required.  However, in saying this, \nconsideration should be given to incorporating\
  \ the foll owing recommendations into the current \nroster system:  \n\uF0B7 A rostered\
  \ day off should not commence the same day a night shift ends  \n\uF0B7 Limits are\
  \ placed on the number of consecutive sh ifts that are able to be worked  \n\uF0B7\
  \ Adequate opportunities are provided to recover fro m any sleep debt prior to the\
  \ next shift \npattern commencing.  At a minimum, two full nights of unrestricted\
  \ sleep should be \nprovided, although greater periods of recovery may be required\
  \ depending on the number \nof consecutive shifts worked and the timing o f those\
  \ shifts\" . \n4.4.15.  KiwiRail should consider these recommendations when addressing\
  \ the Commission's \nrecommendations on this safety issue  (refer to the section\
  \ herein  on the other relevant \ninquiries) .  \nFinal report RO -2013 -106 \n\
  << Page 11 >>\n 4.5. Opinion of the clinical psychologist  \n4.5.1.  As noted earlier\
  \ , the train controller had been referred to the KiwiRail employe e assistance\
  \ \nprogramme .  As part of that programme  the train controller attended three\
  \  sessions with a \nclinical psychologist, who then produced a report to KiwiRail.\
  \  The Commission obtained a \ncopy  of that report . \n4.5.2.  The clinical psychologist\
  \ noted that the train controller  had a reported history of some changes \nin memory\
  \ in particular , which also appeared to correlate with changes in sleep , whereby\
  \ he \nhad become much less able to cope and adjust to changes in sleep (circadian\
  \ rhythm) cycles \nin response to shift work .  The report  commented further  on\
  \ other issues that were preventing \nhim sleeping and relaxing.  \n4.5.3.  The\
  \ clinical psychologist's report then referenced a number of papers citing the effects\
  \ of shift \nwork and fatigue on shift workers.  In conclu ding on the effect s\
  \ of shift work, the clinical \npsychologist said : \nThe above studies indicate\
  \ that chronic sleep disturbance as a consequence of \nshift work can impact negatively\
  \ on (for example) attention,  memory, and \naffective states (i.e. mood and anxiety\
  \ levels).  There can be an accumulative \neffect on cognition when shift work is\
  \ done over long periods of time.  For some \nindividuals this may not necessarily\
  \ affect their work performance greatly.  \nHoweve r, this depends on the nature\
  \ of work.  For the [train controller], his work \nrequires frequently high level,\
  \ consistent and sustained alertness and any lapse, \neven briefly, can have a significant\
  \ impact.  This makes his job much more \nstressful and pressure d by virtue of\
  \ any change in physiological state potentially \nreducing attention to the required\
  \ level.  [The train controller's] description of \nhaving brief occasional lapses\
  \ in awareness but with still [being] able to work in \nan automatic manner  (includin\
  \ g asking questions and going through checks) \nsuggests brief moments in reduced\
  \ alertness  are occurring.  It is notable that the \nserious incident described\
  \ occurred after sleep debt from night shift and then \nreturning to a different\
  \ shift within less than 4 8 hours.  Thus circadian rhythms \nwould have been significantly\
  \ disrupted.  \n4.5.4.  The clinical psychologist recommended that it would not\
  \ be prudent for him to return to the \nrole of train controller.  \n4.6. Summary\
  \  \n4.6.1.  The sleep expert  discussed several aspects of the train controller's\
  \ roster that would have \nplaced him at risk of accumulating a sleep debt.  She\
  \ concluded that it was highly likely that \nthe train controller's performance\
  \ was affected by fatigue, and that his roster did n ot provid e \nhim with sufficient\
  \ opportunity to recover from any sleep debt that accumulated between shift \ncycles.\
  \  She conclu ded that the train controller's sleep recovery periods might have\
  \ been \naffected by sleep difficulties he was experiencing.  \n4.6.2.  The clini\
  \ cal psychologist recognised that some of the problems the train controller was\
  \ \nexperiencing were related to his shift work and the lack of suitable opportunit\
  \ ies to recover \nfrom certain shift cycles.  \n4.6.3.  The potentially  stressful\
  \ nature of train control work, where the consequence s of making an \nerror can\
  \ be serious , had begun to play on the mind of the train controller, and consequently\
  \ \nhad begun to affect his ability to gain sufficient , good -quality , restorative\
  \ sleep . \n4.6.4.  It is likely that t he train controller had been caught in a\
  \ snowballing situation whereby his \nroster was not providing  him with  sufficient\
  \ opportunity to recover from a sleep debt that was \ninduced by the roster itself,\
  \ which was then exacerbated by the train controller's anxiety over \nnot sleeping\
  \  well.  Meanwhile, his fatigue -impaired performance was contributing to several\
  \ \nincidents, resulti ng in hi s becoming more anxious . \n  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n\
  \ Final report RO -2013 -106 4.7. KiwiRail management of underperforming train controllers\
  \  \nSafety issue - The train controller had been involved in three ope rating irregularities\
  \ during \nthe previous 16 months and KiwiRail had identified his having concentration\
  \ and focus issues.  \nDespite this KiwiRail had allowed him to continue in the\
  \ train controller role . \n4.7.1.  The train controller had been identified by\
  \ KiwiRail management as having concentration and \nfocus issues in relation to\
  \ tasks required for the safe execution of track occupation authorities \nas far\
  \ back as February 2012.  This was 16 months before the incide nt at the Otira Tunnel\
  \  \nand after  that time the train controller went on to have two further incidents.\
  \  One of the two \nincidents was described by KiwiRail as creating a significant\
  \ risk of a collision between a train \nand a hi -rail vehicle that had been aut\
  \ horised to occupy the track.  \n4.7.2.  Management was monitoring the train controller\
  \ 's performance using standard assessment \nprocesses consisting of two types of\
  \ safety observation.  All train controllers undergo safety \nobservations at least\
  \ once in every eight mon ths.  As a result of this train controller's \nperformance\
  \ issues , KiwiRail  increased the frequency to one  four-hour observation about\
  \ \nonce every month.  \n4.7.3.  KiwiRail defined the purpose of its safety assessment\
  \ programme  as providing the opportunity \nfor manageme nt to evaluate a person's\
  \ application and knowledge of the various rules, \nregulations and instructions\
  \ applicable to the rail person's duties.  The procedures were not \nspecific about\
  \ how management was to use this methodology in monitoring an individual \nidentified\
  \ with , for example, concentration  and focus issues.  \n4.7.4.  Train control\
  \ is a mentally demanding and stressful role.  Train controllers are required to\
  \ \nmake numerous quick decisions during their shifts and to get these decisions\
  \ right all the \ntime.  Train  controllers must be in peak mental form throughout\
  \ their shifts to achieve this.  A \nlapse of concentration could result in an accident,\
  \ with consequent loss of life and/or \nsignificant damage to property and/or the\
  \ environment.   \n4.7.5.  Given the safety -critical n ature of the train controller's\
  \ role, and having already identified the \nproblem s the train controller was having\
  \  with maintaining focus and attention while working \nthe train control desk,\
  \ a more prudent solution would have been to remove him from the role \npending\
  \ an investigation of his circumstances.   The Commission has recommended that the\
  \ \nChief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency address this safety issue.  \nFindings\
  \  \n3. The KiwiRail train control roster did not allow sufficient opportunity for\
  \ the train \ncontroller to recover from any sleep debt he may have incurred during\
  \ any cycle of \nshifts.  \n4. The train controller's cognitive performance was\
  \ highly likely impaired by fatigue at \nthe time he  authorised the vehicles to\
  \ cross the bridge in the path of the onco ming \ntrain . \n5. The train controller\
  \ was perform ing a safety -critical role  even after KiwiRail had \nidentified\
  \ performance issues similar to those that highly likely contributed to hi s \n\
  authorising the work vehicles to occupy the section of track ahead of the tr ain.\
  \ \n  \nFinal report RO -2013 -106 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.8. Other relevant inquiries\
  \  \n4.8.1.  This is the fifth inquiry that the Commission has undertaken into the\
  \ management and \noperations of KiwiRail's national train control centre in the\
  \ past four years.  The four previous \ninquiries were:  \n\uF0B7 in July 2010 the\
  \ Commiss ion published its report  (08-110)  into a potential low -speed , \nhead\
  \ -on collision at Amokura involving two freight trains (the Amokura inquiry)  \n\
  \uF0B7 in September 2013 the Commission published its report (11-102) into a near\
  \ -collision \nincident between Craigieburn and Staircase involving a coal train\
  \ with two people on \nboard and an alicart driven by a track engineer (the Staircase\
  \ inquiry).  \n\uF0B7 in November 2013 the Commission published its report (11-106)\
  \ into a near -collision \nincident at the Crown Road level crossing near Paerata\
  \ involving a passenger train and \nfive track maintenance workers about to on -track\
  \ some heavy machinery (the Paerata \ninquiry)  \n\uF0B7 in January 2014 the Commission\
  \ published its report (11-105) into a  near collision when \na freight train was\
  \ routed into a section of track that had been closed for major upgrade \nwork at\
  \ Wiri Junction in South Auckland (the Wiri Junction inquiry).  \n4.8.2.  Two substantive\
  \ recommendations  arose out of the four inquiries.  The first recommendation \n\
  (017/10  dated 21 July 2010  from the Amokura report) was issued to the Chief Executive\
  \ of \nthe NZ Transport Agency .  It read as follows:  \nStandards for maximum working\
  \ hours and minimum rest periods on the train \ncontrol roster could result in a\
  \  train controller being fatigued at the start of a shift \neven in the absence\
  \ of any other fatigue -inducing factors. The train control roster \npolicy including,\
  \ but not limited to, standards for maximum working hours and \nminimum rest periods\
  \ should be review ed to ensure it is designed to mitigate \nfatigue and promote\
  \ wellness.  \n4.8.3.  The second recommendation (014/13 dated 26 September 2013\
  \  from  the Staircase report ) \nwas issued to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail.\
  \   It read as follows:  \nEvidence reviewed by the Commission showed that at the\
  \ time of the incident:  \n\uF0B7 train control's workplace culture seemed to value\
  \ those who operated \nindependently and with minimal supervision  \n\uF0B7 minimal\
  \ training and education about detecting and managing stress and \nfatigue had been\
  \ prov ided to train controllers, notwithstanding the safety -\ncritical function\
  \ that they were performing  \n\uF0B7 poor systems existed within train control\
  \ to detect and manage stress and \nfatigue in the workplace  \n\uF0B7 the standard\
  \ protocol within train control was to not provi de train controllers \nwith any\
  \ certainty of reasonable breaks during their shifts.  \nKiwiRail has implemented\
  \ safety actions to ensure that train controllers receive \nalertness management\
  \ training and medical assessments. However, the \nCommission is not convinc ed\
  \ that these safety actions fully address the safety \nissues that it has identified\
  \ regarding workplace culture, training and education.  \nThe Commission recommends\
  \ that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure that train \ncontrol management has\
  \ appropriate arr angements in place to:  \n\uF0B7 detect and manage stress and\
  \ fatigue, including appropriate training and \neducation  \n\uF0B7 remind train\
  \ controllers about the importance of eating properly and regularly \nduring their\
  \ shifts  \n\uF0B7 provide train controllers with certainty of reasonable breaks\
