2013_106,023/14,"The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that he address with KiwiRail the safety issue whereby KiwiRail's standard policy and procedures allowed an ""at-risk"" train controller to continue working at train control workstations while undergoing a formal investigation and remedial process after KiwiRail had identified issues that would have affected his ability to perform his safety-critical role effectively.","The train controller had been identified by KiwiRail management as having concentration and focus issues in relation to tasks required for the safe execution of track occupation authorities following a track occupation irregularity during February 2012. This was 16 months before the track occupation irregularity covered in this report, and during that period the train controller went on to have two further operating irregularities while he remained in the role.
