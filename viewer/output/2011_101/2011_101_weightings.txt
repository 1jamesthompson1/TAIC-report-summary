"2011_101","[14  15  16  17  18  19]","5.0","The signaller had worked ""12 of the previous 13 days before the incident"" and had been transitioning from late shifts to early shifts with only one day off in between (4.1.15). Although the signaller felt well-rested and the incident occurred only ""about 2 hours into her shift"" (4.1.17), the potential for fatigue due to the shift pattern was acknowledged (4.1.18). However, it was determined that fatigue was not likely to have contributed to the incident due to the timing of the shift and the length of the previous shifts (4.1.17-4.1.18).
","0.0","20.0","The incident was primarily caused by human error when the signaller ""momentarily forgot about a train authorised to travel on the wrong line under a Mis.60 procedure"" (Findings). The signaller removed the collar without proper authorization, leading to a potential head-on collision (4.1.2, 4.1.3). The reliance on a single blocking system where dual blocking was required also contributed to the error (4.1.8).
","0.0","15.0","The signaller was certified but had only ""8 months' total experience as a signal box controller"" and had not worked at the Papakura signal box in the previous 6 months (Findings). This lack of recent experience may not have been sufficient to deal with the complexity of operations at the time of the incident (Findings).
","0.0","10.0","The signaller's unfamiliarity with the Papakura signal box after not having worked there for 6 months contributed to the incident (4.1.19-4.1.20). Although the signaller had taken steps to familiarize herself with the operations, the complexity of the situation was a challenge (4.1.20-4.1.21).
","0.0","15.0","Poor communication and the lack of a culture of crew resource management were significant factors. The incident demonstrates that the standard of communication and crew resource management ""has not reached an acceptable level"" (4.1.27-4.1.28). The train controller's plan was not disseminated to all parties, missing early opportunities to avert the potential collision (Findings).
","0.0","10.0","The signaller did not adhere to the established safety procedures by removing the collar without seeking authorization from train control (4.1.2). The signal lever should have had a double ""blocking"" ability, but the system was not designed to enable that (Findings).
","0.0","6.667","Veolia did not have an effective system to ensure that the training and assessment of signallers met industry standards, nor a good system for corrective action once this breach had been identified (4.1.37). The lack of safety observations for signallers indicates a weakness in the organizational safety culture (4.1.36).
","2.887","5.0","The use of a single blocking system where dual blocking was required increased the risk of a signaller moving the control lever without proper authorization (4.1.8). The lack of a double ""blocking"" ability in the signal lever was a design flaw that increased risk (Findings).
","0.0","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to directly attribute the cause of the incident to a lack of regulatory oversight and compliance.
","0.0","5.0","The signaller's loss of situational awareness when she ""momentarily forgot about the train coming the other way under a Mis.60"" was a contributing factor to the incident (4.1.8). The signaller's situational awareness was likely affected by the complexity of the operations and her unfamiliarity with the Papakura signal box (4.1.20-4.1.22).

","0.0","8.333","The failure to effectively communicate the train controller's plan to cross trains at Papakura to all relevant parties, including the driver of Train 210 and the person-in-charge, was a contributing factor (4.1.30-4.1.31). This communication breakdown led to missed opportunities to avert the potential collision (Findings).
