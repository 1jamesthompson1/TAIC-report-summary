- safety_issue: 'The lever in the signal box that was used to change the aspect of Signal 3A at Papakura should have had a double "blocking" ability to remind the signaler that 2 authorisations from 2 different people were required before she should change the signal aspect, but the system had not been designed to enable that.

- safety_issue: 'The signaller was likely to have been distracted by other tasks that had been assigned to her, which is likely to have contributed to her momentarily losing sight of the train controller''s plan to cross trains at Papakura.

- safety_issue: 'The signaller was certified and therefore qualified to operate the Papakura signal box, but she had had only 8 months'' total experience as a signal box controller and had not worked there in the previous 6 months, which may not have been enough total and recent experience to deal with the complexity of operations at the time of the incident.

- safety_issue: 'The KiwiRail train controller''s plan to cross Trains 210 and 201 at Papakura was not disseminated to all the parties who needed to know. Consequently at least 2 early opportunities to avert the potential head-on collision were missed.

- safety_issue: 'Veolia had updated its safety case to reflect the 2006 contract variation that saw it take responsibility for 3 signal boxes, but it had not developed a plan within its safety system to show how it intended to manage the operation. Rather it relied on the train control/signaller experience within its management team to provide oversight of the function.

- safety_issue: 'Records show that the signaller had successfully passed her theory training for signalling operations, but gaps were noted relating to her practical training using the Mis.60 procedure. This gap in her training had never been resolved.

- safety_issue: 'The signaller had not undergone the required formal level A safety observations after gaining certifications at both the Papakura and Pukekohe signal boxes.
