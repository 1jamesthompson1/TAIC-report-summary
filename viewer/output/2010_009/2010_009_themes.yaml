- name: Weight and Balance Management
  explanation: Weight and balance management is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the aircraft's handling characteristics and controllability. In this accident, the aircraft's center of gravity was "at least 0.122m rear of the maximum permissible limit," which created a tendency for the nose to pitch up and was the "most significant factor contributing to the accident" (5.7). The aircraft also became airborne early and at too low an airspeed to prevent uncontrollable nose-up pitch (5.2). The pilots failed to conduct weight and balance calculations on the aircraft, resulting in the aircraft being routinely flown overweight and outside the aft center of gravity allowable limit whenever it carried 8 parachutists (5.9).
- name: Compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
  explanation: Compliance with civil aviation rules is a fundamental safety theme to ensure that aircraft operations adhere to established safety standards. In this case, the aeroplane owner and their pilots did not comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow good, sound aviation practice by failing to conduct weight and balance calculations on the aeroplane (5.9). Additionally, the engineering company that modified the aircraft for parachuting operations did not follow proper processes required by civil aviation rules and guidance (5.4). The flight manual for the aircraft had not been updated to reflect its new role, limiting its usefulness for calculating weight and balance (5.5).
- name: Aircraft Modification and Certification
  explanation: Aircraft modification and certification are crucial to ensuring that any changes to an aircraft's configuration do not adversely affect its airworthiness. The engineering company involved in the conversion of the aircraft did not obtain permission for several modifications, and the documentation covering the modification was incomplete (4.3.4, 4.3.5). The flight manual was not amended as required, and it contained obsolete data related to its former agricultural role (4.3.6). These oversights in the modification and certification process could have safety implications for the aircraft's operation.
- name: Pilot Training and Competency
  explanation: Pilot training and competency are essential for safe aircraft operation, particularly when new types of aircraft or operational roles are introduced. The pilot in this accident was considered competent and had completed conversion training, including several parachute-drop flights under observation (4.6.7). However, the pilots should have made a full weight and balance calculation before each flight, which they did not do (5.8). This oversight suggests a gap in the training or adherence to training that directly impacted the safety of the flight.
- name: Regulatory Oversight
  explanation: Regulatory oversight ensures that aviation operations are conducted safely and in accordance with established standards. In this case, the CAA's oversight and surveillance of commercial parachuting were not adequate to ensure that operators were functioning in a safe manner (4.6.16). The CAA had mechanisms to regulate the parachuting industry but did not effectively use them pending the introduction of Rule Part 115 (4.6.16). The accident highlighted the need for the regulator to maintain good oversight of aircraft modifications and airworthiness (4.5.7).
- name: Use of Safety Restraints
  explanation: The use of safety restraints is a safety theme that can reduce injuries and save lives in survivable accidents. Although the impact in this accident was not survivable, the use of safety restraints could prevent passengers from sliding rearward and altering the aircraft's center of gravity, which could be a factor in other accidents (4.8.2). The reluctance of some parachutists to wear safety restraints due to fear of getting caught up indicates a need for education and potentially the development of restraint systems that are suitable for parachuting operations (4.8.3).
