  \ started as a routine parachute drop.  The circumstances were similar in \nmany\
  \ ways to other routine flights conducted using the same aircraft.  The weather\
  \ conditions \nwere suitable for the flight , and the weight and distribution of\
  \ the tandem masters  and \npassengers would not have been significantly different\
  \ from those of  previous flights.  \n4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses what\
  \ might have happened to cause the crash and also looks \nat several other contributing\
  \ safety issues.  These safety issues include:  \n\uF0B7 aspects of the way the\
  \ operator and aeroplane owner  operated the aircraft  \n\uF0B7 the management of\
  \ the weight and balance of the aircraft  \n\uF0B7 problems with th e process for\
  \ converting the aircraft for parachuting  \n\uF0B7 the CAA 's oversight of the\
  \ conversion to parachuting  \n\uF0B7 the CAA 's oversight of the parachuting industry\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the w earing of restraints in parachute -drop aircraft . \n4.1.3.  Although\
  \ not contributing to this accident , the issue of performance -impairing substances\
  \ \nbeing detected in 2 of the tandem masters is discussed along with the wider\
  \ ramifications for \nthe industry.  \n4.2. The flight  \n4.2.1.  The circumstances\
  \ of the accident flight were consistent with a loss of control of the \naeroplane\
  \ during the  take-off sequence .  There was no evidence of any technical  failure\
  \ , and \nthe engine was capable of  provid ing full power throughout the short\
  \ flight.  The possibility of \nthe pilot having becom e incapacitated was considered\
  \ to be unlikely  because he was fit and in \ngood health, and the flight path \
  \ of the aeroplane indicated that he was attempting to \nmanoeuvre it out of the\
  \ dive.  \n4.2.2.  The pilot had refuelled the aeroplane during the lunch break\
  \ and the weather was still f ine and \ncalm .  The passengers were brief ed in\
  \ preparation for their drop and boarded after the \naeroplane engine had been started.\
  \  While the exact seating positions could not be confirmed, \nthere was nothing\
  \ to suggest that the seating arrangement was any different from  that \nadopted\
  \ on  previous occasions.  The short taxi from the refuel position to the runway\
  \  and the \ninitial part of the take -off roll were  normal.  \n4.2.3.  What was\
  \ different was that the aeroplane may have become airborne early , and that as\
  \ the \naeroplane bec ame air borne it continued to pitch up.  The pitch  up was\
  \ not stopped  and \ncontinued until the aeroplane became nearly vertical .  To\
  \ stop the initial pitch -up the pilot \nwould have needed to apply sufficient forward\
  \ elevator to counter the change in pitch attitude .  \nThe amount of elevator control\
  \ required would have depended on the longitudinal stability of \nthe aircraft \
  \ and elevator effectiveness , the latter being a function of how much forward \n\
  elevator the pilot managed to put in  and the airspeed.  The slower the airspeed,\
  \ the less air \nflow over the elevator and the less effective it would be.  \n\
  4.2.4.  The following  possib ilities for the pitch up were considered : \n\uF0B7\
  \ the pilot deliberate ly getting airborne early  and pulling up steeply  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the flight controls being jammed or locked, preventing  the pilot moving the \
  \ elevator  \ncontrol  \n\uF0B7 the trim not being correctly set , thus catching\
  \ the pilot unawares  \n\uF0B7 the centre of gravity  being excessively rearwards\
  \ and beyond the controllability limits of \nthe aeroplane  \n\uF0B7 the parachutists\
  \  moving rearwards during the acceleration to take-off or during the  \ninitial\
  \ pitch -up, which would have shifted the centre of gravity  further aft  and further\
  \ \noutside  the control  limits of the aeroplane  \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Report 10\
  \ -009 \uF0B7 a combination of any of these  factors . \n4.2.5.  The pilot was an\
  \ experienced parachut e-drop pilot and was thought by his peers to be \ncompetent\
  \ and responsible.  He was reported as fit and healthy, and in preparation for a\
  \ full \nday's flying had retired early the previous night.  With a short break\
  \ before the accident flight \nhe should not have been fatigued .  No reason was\
  \ offered that might have suggested  his \ndecision -making ability was impaired.\
  \  \n4.2.6.  Considering his experience, the pilot should have been aware that the\
  \ centre of gravity  was \nwell aft and therefore he needed to avoid any abrupt\
  \  manoeuvres, especially at low speed.  \nFurther, he would probably have incurred\
  \ the wrath of the t andem masters had he deliberately \nundertaken a steep departure\
  \ from take -off.  The pilot was , therefore,  unlikely to have \ndeliberately g\
  \ ot airborne early and immediately pitch ed the nose of the aeroplane upwards.\
  \  \n4.2.7.  The aeroplane owner noted that during the t ake-off roll, forward elevator\
  \ input was used to \nstop nose -wheel shimmy and counter the effects of the aft\
  \ centre of gravity.  Therefore, while \nthe pilot may not have intended to pitch\
  \ the nose of the aeroplane up high, the possibility that \nhe relaxed the forward\
  \ pressure on the control column late in the take -off roll to  allow it to lift\
  \ \noff gently  earlier cannot be discounted.  \n4.2.8.  The replacement of the\
  \ control cables as part of the engineering work converting the \naeroplane for\
  \ parachuting was routine work and not an indication of any previous control \n\
  problem.  There was no evidence of any binding or fraying of the control  cables\
  \  that could \nhave restrict ed their movement , but the impact damage and fire\
  \ prevented this possibility \nbeing ruled out.  \n4.2.9.  The control lock was\
  \ not located during the site examination and so the possibility of the pilot \n\
  becoming airborne or attempting to become airborne with the controls locked cannot\
  \ be fully \nexcluded.  The engineering company and aeroplane owner submitted that\
  \ this may have been \nthe cause of the accident.  However, this was considered\
  \ unlikely for the following reasons:  \n\uF0B7 The weather conditions were calm\
  \ and there was no obvious requirement for the pilot to \nlock the controls during\
  \ the lunch break  \n\uF0B7 It was not normal practise to use the control lock.\
  \  \n\uF0B7 The pilot typically used a bungee cord if required to hold the control\
  \ column forward for \neasier ingress and egress.  \n\uF0B7 If the control column\
  \ was locked, the pilot should have noticed this when he:  \na. re-entered the cockpit\
  \ and prepared to start the engine,  \nb. moved the aeroplane forward onto the runway,\
  \  \nc. pressed the transmit button on top of th e control column to radio other\
  \ aircraft in the \narea that ZK -EUF was about to take -off, and  \nd. when he\
  \ began to feel the forces on the controls as airspeed increased in the early \n\
  stages of the take off roll.  \n4.2.10.  If the pilot had locked the controls and\
  \ forgotten to unlock them before  commenc ing the take -\noff roll , their locked\
  \ position would have helped to hold the aeroplane nose down on take -off \nand\
  \ the aeroplane would not have become airborne early . Also, if the lock  or bracket\
  \ had given \nway or suddenly released  while the pilot was pulling hard back on\
  \ a locked control column, the \nflight  path  would have been different from  the\
  \ witness accounts t hat the aeroplane bec ame \nairborne then steadily  pitched\
  \ up .  Finally, the direction of the tear in the 2 holes of the \nsupporting bracket\
  \  was down and forward , which  was not consistent with the pilot pulling \nrearwards\
  \ on a locked control column . For this re ason the damage to the control lock bracket\
  \ \nmost likely occurred during the impact.  \n4.2.11.  A post-accident  examination\
  \ of the wreckage confirmed that the elevator trim was set to \nnearly fully forward\
  \ - the normal take -off position.  The setting of the trim was a pre-take-off \n\
  checklist item .  As with most small aircraft , the pilot would have memorised the\
  \ checklist .  \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page 27 >>\n With training and experience\
  \ these checklists can become semi -automated  and pilots  can \nforget items, especially\
  \ when distracted . \n4.2.12.  The possibility of th e pilot taking -off with the\
  \ trim incorrectly set cannot be totally excluded.  \nThe aeroplane owner submitted\
  \ that he had forgotten to reset the trim on other aircraft \nseveral times and\
  \ the pilot may have done likewise.  However, this was considered unlikely  for\
  \ \nthe following reasons : \n\uF0B7 The pilot had erred once , two weeks before\
  \ the accident, and should have been alert to \nsetting the trim correctly before\
  \ take -off. \n\uF0B7 The operator had added a prominent label to remind pilots\
  \ about the trim  \n\uF0B7 If the trim was incorrec tly set, the pilot should have\
  \ recognised the situation early in the \ntake-off roll and stopped the take -off,\
  \ as he had done before.  \n\uF0B7 The trim required about 25 turns of the handle\
  \ to move it through its full range.  There \nwould have been little time to reset\
  \ the trim and the pilot would have more likely been \nusing both hands to try and\
  \ control the aeroplane.  \n\uF0B7 As the aeroplane headed towards the ground the\
  \ pilot would have wanted to pull back \non the elevator and an aft trim would have\
  \ assisted that and so there would have been \nno need to move the trim forward.\
  \  \n4.2.13.  Weight and balance calculations confirmed that the weight of ZK-EUF\
  \ at take -off was 2221  \nkg- 17 kg over the maximum allowable weight.  While the\
  \ overloading  was of  concern, t he \naeroplane had sufficient power to carry the\
  \ additional weight, a s acknowledged whe n it was \npermitted to carry up to 2463\
  \  kg in the restricted agricultural role.   The weight  (mass)  alone \nwas therefore\
  \ not considered to be an initiator of the accident , but would have incr eased\
  \ the \nrate of pitch -up after getting airborne . \n4.2.14.  The calculated centre\
  \ of gravity  during  take-off was 0.122m rear of the aft limit (0.767m  from \n\
  datum)  and may have been further rearward  because the calculation was based on\
  \ \nconservative figures .  Twelve c entimetres might  not appear to be much, but\
  \ with a n allowable  \nrange of 0.428m to 0.645m, or less than 22  centimetres\
  \ , it was more than 55% rearwards of \nthe aft limit and would have had a  detrimental\
  \  effect on the controllability of the aeroplane.  \nHowever,  the operator 's\
  \ trip records indicated that they  had flown 193 parachuting revenue \nflights\
  \  in the preceding 2 months , and that 74 of th ose had had 8 parachutists on board\
  \ .  \n4.2.15.  To determine what was different between  the accident flight and\
  \ the 74 other flight s with 8 \nparachutists, a statistical analysis exercise using\
  \ the Monte Carlo method 13 was undertaken.  \nThe actual weights of parachutists\
  \ recorded by 2 other parachuting operators in about a 3-\nmonth period were used,\
  \ and a base weight of 70.8  kg and a standard deviation of 11.9  kg \napplied.\
  \ It was assumed that the 2 heaviest tandem masters and 2 heaviest parachutists\
  \ had \nbeen  paired and positioned forward of the 2 lighter tandem pairs .  Five\
  \ thousand  random \nsamples were generated and the aft centr e of gravity  limit\
  \ for ZK -EUF was exceeded on all \nsamples .  In 5% of the samples, t he aft limit\
  \ was exceeded by more than 0.120m.  \n4.2.16.  At 0.122m  rear of the aft limit\
  \ , the centre of gravity  on the accident flight was within the 5% \ngrouping ,\
  \ and therefore likely  to have been further aft than the centre of gravity  on\
  \ nearly all \nprevious flights with 8 parachutists .  At a minimum of 0.122m  rear\
  \ of the aft limit , the centre \nof gravity  on the accident flight  was possibly\
  \ the most rearward  centre of gravity  of any of the \naeroplane owner 's previous\
  \ flights . \n4.2.17.  With 8 persons in the rear of the aeroplane , there w ould\
  \ have been  little room to move  or slide \nabout during the take -off and climb.\
  \  There were some  footholds located about the cabin for \npeople to use to brace\
  \ thems elves , and a hand rail along the right inside wall of the aeroplane \n\
  could also have been used.  Video footage of other flights showed no inclination\
  \ for people to \nslide about  during the take -off roll.  Nevertheless, as the\
  \ aeroplane continued to pitch up th ere \nwould have come a point when the parachutists\
  \ were not  able to hold on and would have \n                                  \
  \                      \n13 The Monte Carlo method uses a class of computational\
  \ algorithms based on repeated random sampling.   \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Report 10\
  \ -009 fallen towards the rear of the cabin.  Safety restraints would have prevented\
  \ this.  By falling to \nthe rear of the aeroplane the centre of gravity  would\
  \ have shifted further aft and made the \naeroplane  more uncontrollable .  \n4.2.18.\
  \  The most likely reason for the loss of control was the centre of gravity  being\
  \ well rear of the aft \nlimit, and possibly the most rearward it had ever been.\
  \  This may have caught the pilot \nunawares  and the aeroplane became airborne,\
  \ possibly early  and at too low a speed for the \npilot to have sufficient elevator\
  \ control to stop the ensuing pitch -up.  The only option available \nto the pilot\
  \ at this stage was to close the throttle immediately while the aeroplane was less\
  \ \nthan a few metres into the air.  This window of opportunity was small and some\
  \ damage and \ninjury might still have occu rred. \nFindings  \nThere were no technical\
  \ defects identified that may have contributed to the accident \nand the aeroplane\
  \ wa s considered controllable during the take -off roll, with the engine \nable\
  \ to deliver power during the short flight.  \nThe a eroplane 's centre of gravity\
  \ was at least 0.122m rear of the maximum \npermissible limit, which created a tendency\
  \ for the nose to pitch u p.  The most likely \nreason for the crash was the a eroplane\
  \  being excessively out of balance .  In addition, \nthe aeroplane probably  became\
  \ airborne early and at too low an airspeed to prevent \nuncontrollable nose -up\
  \ pitch .   \nThe aeroplane reached a pitch angle that would have made it highly\
  \ improbable  for \nthe unrestrained parachutists to prevent themselves sliding\
  \ back towards the tail.  Any \nshift in weight rearward would have made the aeroplane\
  \ more un stable . \n \n4.3. Parachuting co nversion  \n4.3.1.  Several variants\
  \ of the Fletcher FU24 and its derivative the Cresco had been converted to \nparachuting.\
  \  The turbine -powered Fletchers provided an economical option for parachuting\
  \ \noperators to expand their business, provide greater capacity, quick er turn\
  \ -around times and \nreduced noise footprint when  compared to piston -powered\
  \ aeroplanes.  ZK -EUF was the fourth \nand most recent Walter Fletcher aeroplane\
  \ to be converted from an agricultural role to \nparachuting.  The engineering company\
  \ had been involv ed to varying degrees with each of the \n4 Walter Fletcher conversions.\
  \  \n4.3.2.  Civil Aviation Rule Part 43 General Maintenance Rules, specifically\
  \ 43.69 and 43.153, directs \npeople performing maintenance or engineering work\
  \ on an aircraft to correctly record the wor k \nperformed.  This is to ensure \
  \ that there is an accurate record for the Civil Aviation Authority, \nand other\
  \ interested individuals or organisations, to confirm the engineering status of\
  \ the \naircraft.  The documentation helps interested persons to confirm the airworthiness\
  \ of the \naircraft and to confirm compliance with other relevant Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules.  \n4.3.3.  The available evidence indicated the workmanship involved in\
  \ the conversion of ZK -EUF was \nto a good standard and the aeroplane owner was\
  \ satisfied with t he finished product.  \nHowever, examination of the engineering\
  \ documentation associated with the conversion soon \nidentified anomalies in the\
  \ process that meant the aeroplane did not com ply with civil aviation \nrules.\
  \  Some examples of these anomalies are desc ribed below .  \n4.3.4.  The engineering\
  \ company had not obtained permission to use several of the modifications \nembodied\
  \ on the aeroplane, specifically the installation of the top grab rail, the lower\
  \ fuselage \nsteps and the fitment  of the air deflector door as requi red by Civil\
  \ Aviation Rule 21.  The \nagreement of the owner of a modification was required\
  \ to ensure the fitment of the \nmodification would not have a detrimental effect\
  \ on the airworthiness of an aircraft.  There \nmay have also been financial implications.\
  \  \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page 29 >>\n 4.3.5.  The documentation covering the\
  \ modification of the aeroplane was incomplete, as no \nreference to the strengthened\
  \ floor in the passenger cabin was recorded on the CAA Form 337 \nand was only to\
  \ be found in the worksheets.  \n4.3.6.  The engineering company had not amende\
  \ d the aircraft flight manual to allow the opening of a \ndoor in -flight as required\
  \ in Civil Aviation Rule Part 91.  The latest weight and balance data \nsheet and\
  \ oxygen supplements had been inserted in the flight manual, but other than that\
  \ it \nhad not been c hanged to reflect the new role the aeroplane was about to\
  \ perform.  The flight \nmanual now contained obsolete data and information related\
  \ to its former agricultural role.  \nThe engineering company should have amended\
  \ the flight manual as required.  \n4.3.7.  The fligh t manual also contained an\
  \ anomaly in the unusable fuel quantity.  The flight manual \nlimitations section\
  \ stated the total fuel capacity for the aeroplane, including unusable, and the\
  \ \nusable fuel quantity.  This gave an unusable fuel quantity of 70 litres f or\
  \ level flight. However, \nthe weight and balance data sheet stated 50.5 litres.\
  \  Although the latter figure was the result \nof actual testing, the more conservative\
  \ figure for the Walter Fletcher fleet should have been \nused because this was\
  \ the CAA -approved  figure.  This anomaly had been there since the \ninstallation\
  \ of the Walter engine and possibly reflected a lack of understanding of the civil\
  \ \naviation rules by the engineering company.  \nFindings  \nThe engineering company\
  \ that modified ZK -EUF for parachuting operations did not \nfollow the proper processes\
  \ required by civil aviation rules and guidance.  Two of the \nmodifications had\
  \ been approved for a different aircraft type, one modification \nbelonged to another\
  \ design holder and a fourth  was not referred to in the aircraft \nmaintenance\
  \ logbo ok. \nThe flight manual for ZK -EUF had not been updated to reflect the\
  \ new role of the \naeroplane  and was limited in its usefulness to the aeroplane\
  \ owner  for calculating \nweight and balance.  \nRegardless of the procedural issues\
  \ with the project to modify ZK -EUF, the engineering \nwork conducted on ZK -EUF\
  \ to convert it from agricultural to parachuting operations in \nthe standard category\
  \ was by all accounts appropriately  carried out . \n4.4. The operator  \n4.4.1.\
  \  The purchase and conversion of ZK -EUF by the aeroplane owner  had reflected\
  \ the growing \npopularity of parachuting, and in particular tandem jumping , both\
  \ locally and nationally .  The \nuse of the Walter  turbine -powered aeroplane\
  \ had proved successful with other parachuting \noperators , so the aeroplane owner\
  \  had assumed that fo llowing the pilots' conversion training \nthe aeroplane could\
  \ immediately be put into operation.  \n4.4.2.  The aeroplane owner  had relied\
  \  on the engineering company  to complete the modification and \nre-categorisation\
  \  of the aeroplane in accordance with the relevant civil aviation rules.  The \n\
  aeroplane owner had not ha d the expertise to check on the engineering company \
  \ processes , \nso had accepted the aeroplane along with the incomplete flight manual\
  \  without question.  \n4.4.3.  The aeroplane owner  had put ZK-EUF into operation\
  \  before it had  document ed standard \noperating procedures , which were being\
  \ written at the time of the accident .  The aeroplane \nowner  had relied on previous\
  \ experience of operating a piston -powered parachuting aeroplane  \nand the information\
  \ gleaned from  other Wal ter Fletcher parachuting operators.  \n4.4.4.  Each flight\
  \ started with a fuel quantity of 160 litres.  Between 50 and 70 litres would be\
  \ \nconsumed depending on the altitude climbed to, which result ed in a f uel quantity\
  \ at landing  of \nbetween 90 litres and  110 litres.  Assuming the best case that\
  \ 50.5 litres were  unusable and \nusing a  typical consumption rate of 160 litres\
  \ per hour of flying , the amount remaining was \nsufficient for between 1 5 minutes\
  \  and 20 minutes of further flight . Using the  CAA-approved \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n\
  \ Report 10 -009 figure of 70 litres unusable, the time remaining for flight was\
  \ half of that (7 to  10 minutes).   \nCivil aviation rules required at least 30\
  \ minutes to be remaining.  \n4.4.5.  The aeroplane owner  accepted the use of a\
  \ lower  fuel reserve , believing that a flight would \nonly take  off in good weather\
  \ and  that with no other aeroplane operators using the aerodrome \nthere was unlikely\
  \ to be any delay in landing.  This, however, made little allowance for other \n\
  possible situations or emergencies that might have require d the pilo t to remain\
  \ airborne for \nlonger than expected.  The decision to remove the flight manual\
  \ f rom the aeroplane may also \nhave been based on good intentions, but had not\
  \ been thought through.  The flight manual \ncontained relevant aircraft information\
  \ to which  a pilot might need quick access during flight.   \nThat is a reason\
  \ for civil aviation rules requir ing it to be on board.  \n4.4.6.  The conversion\
  \ training for the 2 pilots was adequate and comparable with that for  other \n\
  pilots with similar experience .  The pilot's pre vious turbine experience enabled\
  \ him to become \nquickly competent in the aeroplane . \n4.6.1  The standard passenger\
  \ weights appeared suitable for use with ZK-EUF.  The weight of the 9 \npeople on\
  \ board ZK -EUF, not including their parachuting rigs, was estimated to be about\
  \ 640  \nkg (71 kg per person) .  An average weight of 71  kg per person was close\
  \ to th at determined by \nthe second parachuting operator that also flew a Walter\
  \ Fletcher.  The tandem masters in this \ncase weigh ed on average about 5  kg more\
  \ than the passengers , which meant that the \naverage weight of the passengers\
  \ was less than 71  kg. Using  a standard passenger weight \nrather than weighing\
  \ each person was therefore reasonable . \n4.4.7.  During their conversion training\
  \ on another FU24 parachute a eroplane , the 2 pilots  had each \ncompleted several\
  \ weight and balance calculations for the loads being flown at the time, so \nthey\
  \ were familiar with weight and balance calculations.  The calculation they made\
  \ would \nhave shown them that carrying 8 people in the back of the Walter Fletcher\
  \ took it close to its \naft centre of gravity limit.  This should have prompted\
  \ them to make the same calculations for \ntheir own a eroplane  instead of assuming\
  \ the 2 aeroplanes  were the same.  \n4.4.8.  The weight and balance data for ZK\
  \ -EUF varied signif icantly from that in the other 3 Walter \nFletcher aeroplanes\
  \ used in parachuting.  It was between 64  kg and 101  kg heavier and had a \ncentre\
  \ of gravity  between 0.066 m and 0.132m further aft.  The basic weight and balance\
  \ \ncalculation s completed by the engineering company  holder w ere consi dered\
  \ to be accurate.  \nThe weight difference s between ZK -EUF and the other 3 aeroplanes\
  \ arose from their different \nagricultural spraying and sowing equipment being\
  \ fitted to each aeroplane and possible \nadditional protec tion to the underside\
  \ of the aeroplane .  These  had all added weight further \naft. \n4.4.9.  Had the\
  \  aeroplane owner  completed a weight and balance calculation  for ZK -EUF, even\
  \ using \naverage weights and the chart and information available in the flight\
  \ manual, they would have \nfound that the aeroplane was near  its maximum allowable\
  \ weight and outside the aft centre of \ngravity  limit for all loads involving\
  \ 8 parachutists.  \nFindings  \nThe weight and balance of the aeroplane , with\
  \ its centre of gravity at least 0. 122m \noutside  the maximum aft limit , would\
  \ have caused serious handling issues for the pilot \nand was the most significant\
  \ factor contributing to the accident.  \nZK-EUF was 17  kg over its maximum permissible\
  \ weight on the accident flight, but was \nstill 242  kg lighter than the maximum\
  \ all -up weight  for which the a eroplane  was \ncertified in its previous agricultural\
  \ role.  Had the aeroplane not been out of balance it \nis considered the excess\
  \ weight in itself would have been  unlikely to cause the \naccident.  Nevert heless,\
  \  the pilots should have made a full weight and balance \ncalculation  before each\
  \ flight . \nThe aeroplane owner  and their  pilots  did not comply with civil aviation\
  \ rules and did \nnot follow good , sound aviation practice by failing to conduct\
  \ weight and ba lance \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page 31 >>\n calculations  on the\
  \ a eroplane . This resulted in the a eroplane  being routinely flown \noverweight\
  \ and outside the aft centre of gravity allowable limit whenever it carried 8 \n\
  parachutists.  \nThe empty weight and balance for ZK -EUF was properly recorded\
  \ in the flight manual, \nbut the stability information in that manual had not been\
  \ appropriately amended to \nreflect its new role of a parachute a eroplane . Nevertheless\
  \ , it was still possible for the \naeroplane operator to  initially  have calculated\
  \ the weight and balance of the \naeroplane  for the predicted operational loads\
  \ before entering the a eroplane  into \nservice.  \nThe aeroplane owner  did not\
  \ comply with civil aviation rules and did not follow good , \nsound aviation practice\
  \ when  they: used the incorrect amount of fuel reserves ; \nremoved the flight\
  \ manual from the a eroplane ; and did not formulat e their  own \nstandard operating\
  \ procedures before using the a eroplane  for commercial \nparachuting operations.\
  \  \n4.5. The role of the regulator  \n4.5.1.  The conversion of ZK -EUF for parachuting\
  \  involved the removal of its agricultural equipment \nand the installation of\
  \ a number of STCs and modifications - both major and minor.  The \nWalter Fletcher\
  \ was originally certified in both the restricted and standard air worthiness \n\
  categories.  The conversion of the aeroplane, therefore, did not require a new type\
  \ certificate  \nto be issued but did in the opinion of the Commission require the\
  \ CAA to ensure  that the work \nhad been  correctly carried out.  \n4.5.2.  The\
  \ Director of Civil A viation delegated the function of approving design changes\
  \ to \"certified \ndesign organisations \" that employed CAA \"design delegation\
  \ holder s\" as \"senior person s\".  \nThe Director  also delegated the function\
  \  of oversight of the modification work  to engineers \nwith \"inspection authori\
  \ sations \".  The Director was able to delegate these functions under \nsection\
  \ 23B of the Civil Aviation Act.  The delegations made those organisations and persons\
  \ \naccountable to the Director for that work, but in the opinion o f the Commission\
  \ did not absolve \nthe Director's responsibility.  Just as an organi sation is\
  \ responsible for the performance of its \ncontractors, so too was the Director\
  \ responsible for  ensuring these delegation holders were \nperforming the tasks\
  \ in line with  civil aviation rules and good , sound aviation engineering \npractice.\
  \  It was incumbent on th e Director therefore to maintain some form of control\
  \ or \noversight of the STC and modification process es. \n4.5.3.  In this case\
  \ the engineering company contracted a certified design organisation, and its chief\
  \ \nengineer held an inspection authority.  This meant that the engineering company\
  \ could have in \neffect submit ted its own data to assess itself, approve d that\
  \ data as acceptable, classif ied the \nmodification as mi nor or major and , if\
  \ major, certif ied conformity with  the Civil Aviation  Rules, \nundertake n the\
  \ work and sign ed off the work using its own inspection authority. If it had not\
  \ \nbeen for the requirement to return the aircraft to the standard category, all\
  \ of t his could have \ntaken place without recourse to the CAA.  \n4.5.4.  The\
  \ CAA said that i n approving the change in airworthiness category  it was only\
  \ concerned \nthat the aeroplane was airworthy and  that the 2 STC modifications\
  \ had been embodied  (the \nrequirement for a fue l drain and the installation of\
  \ an  alternate air intake door to the engine) .  \nIt was not the CAA's  role under\
  \ the relevant rule to approve the role or use of an aircraft. The \nCAA said that\
  \ the responsib ility for ensur ing the aeroplane was safe to fly  rested with the\
  \ \naircraft owner .   \n4.5.5.  There are 2 issues with this approach.  The first\
  \ is that the aeroplane owner  did not , and was \nnot required to , have the expertise\
  \ to judge whether the modification was appropriate.  Like \nthe Director, the aeroplane\
  \ owner  left that to the engineering company  and the design \ndelegation holder\
  \ to exercise their obligations and requirements under the Rules as they saw \n\
  fit.  The second issue is that the parachuting operation was essentially unregulated.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Report 10 -009 4.5.6.  The information requeste d from the\
  \ engineering company  by the CAA was adequate as a basis \nfor approv ing the change\
  \ in airworthiness category, provided the information  was complete \nand correct.\
  \  The CAA was subsequently satisfied that the requirements had been  met and \n\
  approved the change in category.  While this was in accordance with the current\
  \ rules and \npracti ces, an opportunity was not taken by  the CAA to review the\
  \ full documentation provided \nto help ensure that the aeroplane owner , who had\
  \ never flown a tu rbine -powered aircraft \nbefore, was about to operate an aeroplane\
  \ that was fit for purpose.  Had the CAA done so it \nmight  have noted  that there\
  \ w as both incorrect and missing documentation.  It might  also \nhave required\
  \ the flight manual to be amended to ens ure that it contained  the information\
  \ \nthat pilots required in order to operate the aeroplane safely, such as the procedure\
  \ s for \nopening  a door in -flight and  for calculat ing the centre of gravity\
  \ . \n4.5.7.  This accident highlighted how critical it is for a regulator  to maintain\
  \ a good oversight of the \nmodification and airworthiness of aircraft.  Special\
  \ -purpose aircraft, especially those \nundergoing one -off type modifications,\
  \ require d additional attention to ensure airworthiness \nstandards were  maintained.\
  \  \n4.5.8.  The Commission considered the question, should major modifications\
  \ and STCs be referred \nback to the original type certificate holder?  The Commission\
  \ considered this from a safety and \nstandards point of view and has not taken\
  \ commercial considerations into  account.  To help \nwith this question  a comparison\
  \ was made with how other countries deal t with the issue.  The \nprocess in New\
  \ Zealand was found to be similar to those of other countries that manufacture \n\
  aircraft.  \n4.5.9.  In New Zealand the Director of Civil Aviat ion can require\
  \ a design delegation holder to consult \nthe type certificate owner over a major\
  \ modification or STC, but this is entirely at the Director's \ndiscretion  (Rule\
  \ Part 21.123) .  If the designer has sufficient data to consider  adequately  what\
  \ \neffect  a modification would have on the aircraft in line with civil aviation\
  \ rules, it might not be \nnecessary to consult the type certificate holder.  However\
  \ , it would seem the prudent thing to \ndo in some cases to alleviate any doubt.\
  \  \n4.5.10.  There are analogies with a lmost all other modes of transport . When\
  \ someone is wanting to \nmodify a car, bus, train or ship  they are rarely required\
  \ to consult the manufacturer  first.  \nThere is usually the simple requirement\
  \ that after modification the vehicle must meet the \nstandards  of the day.  \n\
  4.5.11.  The CAA now says that it would not approve a similar conversion in the\
  \ future without ensuring \nthat the modifications were applicable to the aircraft\
  \ being converted and  that the flight \nmanual was amended to reflect the new role.\
  \  The CAA now says also that some of the \nmodifications made when  converting\
  \ ZK -EUF to parachuting should have been completed as \nSTCs rather than  as major\
  \ modifications.  The CAA's amendment of the conditions governing \nall design delegation\
  \ holders , while it primarily was intended to align New Zealand with best \ninternational\
  \ practice, should result in better management  of the STC and modification  \n\
  process .  The design delegation holder amendment was issued on 24 August 2010,\
  \ after ZK -\nEUF had been modified but before the accident.  This has been acknowledged\
  \ as a safety \naction that would otherwise have resulted in  a recommendation by\
  \ the Commission.  \nFindings  \nThe Director of Civil Aviation delegated the task\
  \ of assessing and overseeing major \nmodifications to Rule Part 146 design organisations\
  \ and individual holders of \n\"inspection authorisations \".  The delegations did\
  \ not absolve the Director of his \nresponsibility to monitor complianc e with civil\
  \ aviation rules and guidance.  \nThe delegations increased the risk that unless\
  \ properly managed the CAA could lose  \ncontrol of 2 safety -critical functions\
  \ : design and inspection .  The Director had not \nappropriately managed  that\
  \ risk with the curre nt oversight program me. \n \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page\
  \ 33 >>\n The CAA had adhered strictly to its normal practice and was acting in\
  \ accordance with \ncivil aviation rules when approving the change in airworthiness\
  \  category from special \nto standard.  However, knowing the scope, size and complexi\
  \ ty of the modifications \nrequired to change ZK -EUF from an agricultural to a\
  \ parachuting aeroplane , it should \nhave had greater participation in the process\
  \ to help ensure there were no safety \nimplications.  \nThere was a flaw in the\
  \ regulatory system that allowed an engineering company \nundertaking major modification\
  \ work on an aircraft to have little or no  CAA \ninvolvement by using an internal\
  \ or contracted design delegation holder and a person \nwith the inspecti on authorisation\
  \ to oversee and sign off the work.  \n4.6. Regulatory oversight of the parachuting\
  \ industry  \n4.6.1.  Parachuting operators  were not certificated and  there were\
  \ no rules that fully governed the \noperation , other than Rule Part 105 and the\
  \ common general oper ating rules of Part 91.  \nParachuting operators were, therefore,\
  \ not subject to inspections and audits.  The CAA had not \nestablished a risk profile\
  \ for the industry . \n4.6.2.  With nearly 100 000 tandem jumps being undertaken\
  \ annually, the parachuting industry had \ngrown significantly in recent years.\
  \  New parachuting operations had been established to meet \nthe increased demand,\
  \ and previously small, mainly recreational, operators had expanded into \nmedium\
  \ -sized commercial businesses.  The CAA had recognised this evolut ion and had\
  \ \nidentified the need to develop rules to better regulate these operations.  However,\
  \ in the \nmeantime these operations had flourished unchecked.  \n4.6.3.  Some \
  \ parachuting  operators were flying larger and more powerful aircraft, often carrying\
  \ more \npasseng ers, than some certificated small commuter operator s. Despite\
  \ this the CAA directed \nminimal additional resources towards  ensur ing the safe\
  \ conduct of these activities  throughout \nthe long process of developing a rule\
  \ .  The biennial visits by the CAA aviatio n safety adviser \nwere irregular and\
  \ informal, and would not have identified the causal factors that led to this \n\
  accident.  \n4.6.4.  The United States special report on parachuting operators highlighted\
  \ 3 recurring safety \nissues that were relevant to the parachuting industry in\
  \ New Zealand in general and this \naccident in particular.  These issues included\
  \ aircraft maintenance, pilot performance and \nregulatory oversight.  \n4.6.5.\
  \  Commercial parachuting operations were based on repetitive , short -cycle flights\
  \ that involved \nextended high -power settings for the climb s, immediately followed\
  \ by rapid descents.  This \nplaced increased demands on aircraft and engines that,\
  \ with the possible exception of \ntopdressing, might not otherwise normally have\
  \ occur red.  Although no technical  failure was \nidentified in this accident,\
  \ operators and pilots need to ensure that aircraft are correctly \nmaintained and\
  \ operated at all times.  The CAA also needs to be actively involved with  the \n\
  industry to ensure that proper maintenance practices are ad hered to.  \n4.6.6.\
  \  The Walter Fletcher was a different type of aeroplane from  the Cessna aeroplane\
  \ the owner  \nhad flown before.  It was heavier, more powerful, able to carry more\
  \ parachutists and capable \nof reaching drop altitude s more quick ly.  It also\
  \ had a turbin e engine that required different \nhandling skills and, because of\
  \ the flight profile adopted by the aeroplane operator, it had to \nbe refuel led\
  \ between each load.  The introduction of the aeroplane into service therefore \n\
  needed to be carefully managed.  \n4.6.7.  The p ilot of ZK -EUF was considered\
  \ to be a competent pilot.  He was experienced in the \nparachuting role and had\
  \ recently completed conversion training that had included several \nparachute -drop\
  \ flights under the observation of an instructor.  He was, therefore, c urrent as\
  \ a \nparachuting pilot.   \n\n<< Page 34 >>\n Report 10 -009 4.6.8.  Pilots were\
  \ required to undergo regular checks to ensure that their general aircraft piloting\
  \ \nskills, emergency drills and aviation and aircraft knowledge were up to standard.\
  \  However, \nonce a pilot had obtained a parachute -drop  rating, provided they\
  \ maintained their currency by \ncompleting 6 parachute drops in the preceding 12\
  \ months, there was no requirement for an \nindependent check by a qualified examiner.\
  \  \n4.6.9.  The operator was not certificated .  Parachuting, like other adventu\
  \ re aviation activities, was \nnot subject to the same CAA regulatory oversight\
  \ that applied to commercial air operators.  \nThe CAA was  relying on the implementation\
  \ of Rule Part 115 to help ensure  that these types of \noperator developed appropriate\
  \ procedures and were part of the safety audit process.  The \nintroduction of Rule\
  \ Part 115 had, however, suffered several delays over the years  but entered \n\
  into force on 10 November 2011 ( refer to  the \"Safety action s\" section of the\
  \ report for more \ndetail) . \n4.6.10.  The Director of Civil Aviation believed\
  \ he had limited powers under the C ivil Aviation  Act to \nregulate parachuting\
  \ activities . The Commission agree s that there were some limitations, but \nthe\
  \ mechanism was there in section 15(1)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act, whi ch gives\
  \  the Director \nthe power to require any person that : \n\". . .operates , maintains,\
  \ or services, or does any other act in respect of any aircraft, \naeronautical\
  \ product, aviation -related service, air traffic service, or aeronautical \nprocedure\
  \ to undergo or carry out such inspections and such monitoring as the \nDirector\
  \ sees necessary in the interests of civil aviation safety and security. \" \n4.6.11.\
  \  The limitation  was that the Director , in exercising a special power , would\
  \ need to have a \nreasonable belief that the i nterests of civil aviation  safety\
  \ were at risk.  To form that belief \nsomeone would have  had to bring  the matter\
  \ to his attention if it was no t covered by routine \nmonitoring. T he operation\
  \ of parachute -drop  aircraft  was not covered by routine monitoring \nand nothing\
  \ untoward with the operation had been notified to the Director , so he had had\
  \ no \nreason to intervene . \n4.6.12.  Alternatively, u nder the designation for\
  \ the CAA to administer the HSE Act,  ZK-EUF was the \nplace of work for the pilot\
  \ and tandem masters involved in the accident.  Certain aspects of \nthe Fox Glacier\
  \ aerodrome operation also came under this  purview if the safety of those on \n\
  board the aircraft were  compromised by some act or omiss ion. They, like the operator,\
  \ were \nsubject to the HSE Act and therefore had a collective responsibility to\
  \ ensure it was a safe \nworking environment.  As the designated authority to administer\
  \ the HSE Act for the aviation \nsector, the CAA also had an obligat ion to promote\
  \ safe work practices and educate \nparticipants and aviation document holders -\
  \ operators and licensed and qualified personnel \nsuch as pilots and tandem masters.\
  \  \n4.6.13.  The CAA did make available material such as the Good Aviation Practice\
  \ publication s, to help \neducate pilots and operators generally.  Included within\
  \ this series of publications was the \n\"Weight and Balance \" booklet that the\
  \ aeroplane owner reported he had never read.  \n4.6.14.  The CAA's HSE Unit had\
  \ sampled the parachuting industry in anticipatio n of the adoption of \nthe new\
  \ Rule Part 115.  With their limited experience and focus, the HSE  Unit staff members\
  \ \nwere limited to looking at personal safety issues , which they considered to\
  \ be of a good \nstandard.  As a result no concerns were raised for fur ther investigation.\
  \  \n4.6.15.  The HS E Unit focused its attention on personal responsibil ity, while\
  \ operational responsibility \nwas left to be overseen by the CAA's audit, inspection,\
  \ safety information and enforcement \npersonnel.  The HSE Unit was able to undertake\
  \ so me 30 audits per year , and with more than  \n400 certificated organisations\
  \ the priority was understandably  to focus on those sectors or \noperators that\
  \ were at greater risk  or had the potential for greater injury, for example medium\
  \ \nand large passenger aircraft .  These were identified through the CAA's risk\
  \ management \nscheme and were generally part of the CAA's regular audit programme.\
  \  \n \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page 35 >>\n 4.6.16.  As far as the HSE Act is concerned\
  \ , there is no d ifferentiation  between operational safety and \npersonal safety.\
  \  If an operational safety matter affected the safety of employees in the \nworkplace,\
  \ the Director had the power to intervene under his designation.  Given the growth\
  \ in \nthe parachuting industry and the length  of time taken to develop Rule Part\
  \ 115, this would \nhave  been a prudent measure.  \n \n \n \n \n4.7. Performance\
  \ -impairing substances  \n4.7.1.  Although the consumption/ingestion of cannabis\
  \ was not contributory to th is accident, the \npresence of THC in 2 of the tandem\
  \ masters, albeit one of very low level, was a concern. T he \ntandem masters on\
  \  board ZK -EUF were not crew  members of the aeroplane.  However, a \nparachute\
  \ when in use was considered by the CAA to be an aircraft  and the  tandem masters\
  \  \neach held a rating issued under C ivil Aviation Rules.  They were therefore\
  \ subject to Rule Part \n19.7, prohibiting the use of performance -impairi ng substance\
  \ s. \n4.7.2.  The role of tandem master was critical to the safe conduct of a parachuting\
  \ descent .  Tandem \nmasters , like pilots,  needed to be fully alert to conduct\
  \ their routine duties and react  \nappropriately in case of an emergency.  All\
  \ transport modes have complex tasks, and \nparticipants need to  be fully fit and\
  \ healthy to complete those tasks  safely . \n4.7.3.  Although the intent of Rule\
  \ 19.7 is clear , the matter of what impairment means is subjective in \nthe absence\
  \ of any laws that prescribe limits , such as  those  in existence for alcohol and\
  \ road \nusers.  The issue has been raised in other Commission reports ( such as\
  \  marine report 09-201) \nand a recommendation made to the Secretary for Transport\
  \ to address the issue.   \nFinding  \nAn alcohol and drug testing regime needs\
  \ to be initiated for persons performing \nactivities critical to flight safety,\
  \  to detect and  deter the use of performance -impairing \nsubstances . \n4.8.\
  \ Safety restraints  \n4.8.1.  Proper safety  restraints have been shown to reduce\
  \ flailing injuries and save lives in those \naccidents deemed survivable.  However,\
  \ the impact forces sustained when ZK -EUF struck the \nground in a near -vertical\
  \ angle would  not been survivable even if typical safety harne sses  had \nbeen\
  \ fitted and worn . \n4.8.2.  Even if the parachutists had been wearing safety restraints\
  \ , it is unlikely this would have \nprevented the accident , because the evidence\
  \ suggests the aircraft became uncontrollable as \nsoon as it became airborne. \
  \ The passenge rs in the back would not likely have slid towards the \ntail until\
  \ the aircraft had pitched up to a steep angle, at which point it would have been\
  \ \nunrecoverable at such a low altitude.  \n4.8.3.  The reluctance of some parachutists\
  \ to wear safety restraints for fear of  getting caught up was \nbased on others'\
  \ experiences and was understandable.  Any enforced requirement to wear Findings\
  \  \nThe level of parachuting activity in New Zealand warranted a stronger level\
  \ of \nregulatory oversight than had been applied in recent years.  \nThe CAA's\
  \ oversight and surveillance of commercial parachuting were not adequate to \nensure\
  \ that operators were functioning in a safe manner.  \nThe CAA had mechanisms through\
  \ the Director's powers under the Civil Aviation Act \nand his designated powers\
  \ under the HSE Act to effectively regulate the parachuting \nindustry pending the\
  \ introduction of Rule Part 115.  \n\n<< Page 36 >>\n Report 10 -009 restraints\
  \ risks being ignored as a result.  Single -point restraints may stop people sliding\
  \ \nabout, but have proven not to be effective in moderat e and high -energy accidents.\
  \   \n4.8.4.  The joint study by the FAA and U nited States Parachute Assoc iation\
  \ , when completed, may \nprovide guidance on what, if any, form of safety restraint\
  \ may promote accident survivability \nfor parachutists.  Meanwhile the Commission's\
  \ safety recommendation on the matter remains \nopen until further work has been\
  \ completed to weigh the benefits against the cost s. \nFindings  \nIn this case\
  \ the impact was not survivable and the passengers wearing safety \nrestraints would\
  \ not have prevented their deaths, but in other circumstances the \nwearing of safety\
  \ restraints might  reduce injuries and save lives.  \nSafety harnesses or restraints\
  \ would help  to prevent passengers sliding rearward a nd \naltering the centre\
  \ of gravity of the aircraft.  It could not be established if this was a \nfactor\
  \ in this accident . \n \nReport 10 -009 \n<< Page 37 >>"
