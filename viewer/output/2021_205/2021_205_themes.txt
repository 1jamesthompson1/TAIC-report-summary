Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of understanding and knowledge: The crew did not fully understand the functioning and risks associated with the telescopic accommodation ladder, leading to inadequate hazard identification and risk perception.

2. Non-compliance with procedures: The crew did not follow the operating procedures for deploying and retrieving the ladder, such as untying the handrail ropes but leaving the handrail chains in place. This non-compliance contributed to the accident.

3. Inadequate supervision and oversight: There was a lack of supervision and intervention by the person in charge and other officers observing the operation. This lack of oversight allowed unsafe conditions and actions to persist.

4. Ineffective risk assessment: The risk assessment for retrieving the accommodation ladder did not identify all the potential hazards, such as the ladder falling off the platform. The crew also missed the opportunity to review the risks and mitigation strategies through a toolbox meeting before starting work.

5. Safety culture and leadership issues: There were systemic issues regarding safety culture and leadership onboard, including non-conformance to operating procedures and a diffusion of responsibility. This resulted in a lack of adherence to safety measures and an acceptance of unsafe behaviors.

6. Lack of training and audits: While crew training was conducted, there were no audits to assess the effectiveness of the training and whether there was a change in behavior. This lack of follow-up and evaluation may have contributed to non-compliance with procedures.

Overall, the themes/causes present in the report include lack of understanding and knowledge, non-compliance with procedures, inadequate supervision and oversight, ineffective risk assessment, safety culture and leadership issues, and lack of training and audits.
