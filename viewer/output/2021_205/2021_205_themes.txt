Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of understanding and knowledge: The crew did not fully understand the functioning and risks associated with the telescopic accommodation ladder, leading to inadequate hazard identification and risk perception.

2. Non-compliance with procedures: The crew did not follow the operating procedures for retrieving the accommodation ladder, such as untying the handrail ropes but leaving the handrail chains in place. They also did not adjust the slack side chains, which could have prevented the ladder from falling off the platform.

3. Inadequate supervision and intervention: There was a lack of supervision and intervention by the person in charge and other officers observing the operation. They did not call a stop to work or ensure that the crew member moved to a safe position.

4. Insufficient risk assessment: The risk assessment did not identify all possible scenarios that could cause the lower ladder to retract in an uncontrolled manner, such as the ladder falling off the platform. The hazard associated with this was not considered.

5. Safety culture and leadership issues: There were systemic issues regarding safety culture and leadership onboard, including non-conformance to operating procedures and a diffusion of responsibility. There was a lack of audits to assess the effectiveness of training and behavior change.

6. Equipment and maintenance issues: The wire sling used as a designated anchor point did not have a safe working load marked on it and did not meet any standards. The gangway net, which could have prevented falling overboard, had been removed and stored away.

Overall, the themes/causes present in this report include lack of understanding and knowledge, non-compliance with procedures, inadequate supervision and intervention, insufficient risk assessment, safety culture and leadership issues, and equipment and maintenance issues.
