  \ the circumstances surrounding the event to identify \nthose factors  that increased\
  \ the likelihood of it occurring or the severity of its outcome. \nIt also examines\
  \ any safety issues that have the potential to adversely affect future rail \noperations.\
  \  \n3.2 The safe separation and protection of track workers from rail vehicles\
  \ is a fundamental \npremise for rail oper ations . It is therefore essential that\
  \ proven safe methods of \nworking are in place to prevent the potential for interactions\
  \ between rail traffic and \ntrack workers.   \n3.3 The KiwiRail Track Safety Rules\
  \ ha ve 10 track protection systems that are available for \nuse, depending on a\
  \ combination of : the nature and duration of the work activity ; the \nsignalling\
  \ system on the section of track ; and the number of trains passing over th is \n\
  section during an 8  hour working day.   \n3.4 KiwiRail Operating Rule 908  - Blocking\
  \ is use d to protect a track occupation within \nautomatic signalling areas by\
  \ TC holding signals that govern entry into the PWA  at red \n(STOP).   \n3.5 In\
  \ this incident, the RPO and the train controller  did not share a common \nunderstanding\
  \ of the limits of the  PWA . As a r esult, a n HRV  cleared the track outside \n\
  the PWA  only a few minutes before a locomotive passed through travelling at close\
  \ to \nthe maximum authorised line speed.   \n3.6 During the incident analysis,\
  \ fatigue was ruled out as having contributed to this \nincident, as both the train\
  \ controller  and the RPO were well rested.  \n3.7 The signal ling system data indicated\
  \ that the signals were functioning as designed at \nthe time of the incident. \
  \ \n3.8 The results of post -incident toxicological tests performed on the KiwiRail\
  \ staff involv ed \nin the incident were negative for alcohol and other impairing\
  \ drugs.  \nKiwiRail Operating Rule 908  - Blocking  \n3.9 Rule 908 required that\
  \ the person proposing to occupy or obstruct a section of track \nprotected by interlocked\
  \ signalling ( the addressee) was to personally advise TC of their:  \n\u2022 identity\
  \  \n\u2022 type of protection requested  \n\u2022 on-tracking location (at location)\
  \  \n\u2022 occupation area, including off -tracking location  \n\u2022 time required\
  \ for the work  \n\u2022 nature of the work . \n3.10  Before authorising the track\
  \ occupati on, the train controller  was required to:  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020\
  \ -104 | 8 \u2022 carry out pre -authorisation checks to ensure the proposed occupancy\
  \ did \nnot conflict with other rail movements , either train or HRV \n\u2022 verify\
  \ the position of the last train to clear the on-tracking  location  \n\u2022 record\
  \ the details of the track occupation on the TC diagram  \n\u2022 apply blocking\
  \ of signals to prevent trains from entering the occupied area \nbefore authorising\
  \ the track occupation . \n3.11 The train controller  would  then authorise the\
  \ track occupation by stating  the: \n\u2022 addressee  \n\u2022 commencement time\
  \  \n\u2022 clearance time  \n\u2022 'At' location  \n\u2022 authority to either\
  \ proceed from (or to), or work between (locations)  \n\u2022 last train clear time\
  \ of the on -tracking 'At' location  \n\u2022 section of track verified as blocked\
  \ .  \n3.12 The addressee obtaining the blocki ng would then  complete a n Mis 71\
  \ Track \nOccupation Cross Check form (see Appendix 1), with the instructions issued\
  \ by TC, \nincluding  the: \n\u2022  addressee  \n\u2022 commencement time  \n\u2022\
  \ clearance time  \n\u2022 'At' location  \n\u2022 authority to either proceed from\
  \ (or to), or work between (loc ations)  \n\u2022 last train clear time of the on-tracking\
  \ 'At Location ' \n\u2022 section of track verified as blocked.  \n3.13 The next\
  \ check is for the addressee to read back the instructions recorded on the Mis \n\
  71 to the train controller , who then verifies or corrects the instructions before\
  \ the \naddressee can occupy the PWA . \n3.14 Features and locations referred to\
  \ in the communicatio n between the RPO and the \ntrain controller  are shown in\
  \ Figure 4. \n \n  Final Report RO -2020 -104 \n<< Page 9 >>\n  \nFigure 4: Schematic\
  \ diagram showing features recorded on the Mis 71 Track  \nOccupation Cross Check\
  \ form  \n(Credit: Transport Accident Investigation Commission ) \n \n3.15 All communication\
  \ with TC is recorded. A download  of the radio communication \nbetween the RPO\
  \ and the train controller  showed  that at 0705 the RPO made an \nenqui ry to TC\
  \ by radio. A transcript of that communication can be seen below : \n\"Good morning\
  \ control, 70367 [call sign for the RPO] down here requesting blocking thanks \n\
  mate. Currently at the five decimal nine five kilometre between Te Rapa and Ruakura\
  \ \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2020 -104 | 10 wanting to work between Te Rapa 181 Signal\
  \ and Eureka 8L  after the next service tha nk \nyou.\" \n3.16 After carrying out\
  \ a pre -authorisation check, the train controller  responded : \n\"Yeah , Roger\
  \ that 70367, show you on -tracking at the five decimal nine five kilometre mark\
  \ \nthat is between Ruakura and Hamilton. Show you working between the 181 Signal\
  \ Hamilton \nthrough to  8L Signal Ruakura.  \nCommencement time of 0706, give you\
  \ through to 0800.  \nLast train to clear the limits was M52. Clearing the limits\
  \ at 0551.  \nBlocking in place from Signals 185, 183 Hamilton through to 8R Signal\
  \ at Ruakura , over. \" \n3.17 The RPO accepted the blocking and completed the Mis\
  \ 71 Track Occupation Cross \nCheck form (see Figure 5) and read  back the instructions\
  \ to TC at 0706, stating:  \n\"Roger, thank you control, 70367 currently at 5 .95\
  \ kilometre between Hamilton and \nRuakura, commencing 0706 hours clear by 0800.\
  \  \nWanting to work between Hamilton 181 Signal and Eureka 8L  \nLast trai n M52\

  \ train controller  stated:  \n\"Yes, Roger that is all correct . \nYes, that also\
  \ covers 74258. \" \n3.19 The RPO closed the radio communication stating:  \n\"\
  Roger, thank you control, 70367 out. \" \nFigure 5: Mis 71 Track Occupation Cross\

  \ 11 >>\n Rule 908  - Blocking should have provided adequate safe -working controls\
  \ . \nAlthough the process for the signal blocking was followed, the RPO and the\
  \ \ntrain controller  did not listen to each  other sufficiently to prevent them\
  \ having a \ndiffer ent understanding of the limits of the  PWA .   \nProtection\
  \ of the worksite  \n3.20 When t he RPO asked for an authority to work between Te\
  \ Rapa 181 Signal and Eureka \n8L Signal , the train controller  gave authority\
  \ to work between Hamilton  181 Signal and \nRuakura 8L Signal. Blocking had been\
  \ applied to Hamilton 183 and 185 Signals and \nRuakura 8R Signal. The RPO's read\
  \ -back stated that work between Te Rapa 181 Signal \nand Eureka 8L Signal and blocking\
  \ ap plied to Signals 183 and 185 Te Rapa and \nRuakura 8R.    \n3.21 The train\
  \ controller  verified the RPO's read -back as being correct , despite the RPO \n\
  stating a work between limit as Eureka 8L Signal and not Ruak ura 8L as authorised\
  \ and \nas drawn on the  TC diagram. Th e opportunity to correct the RPO's understanding\
  \ of \nthe limits of the track occupation was therefore lost.  \n3.22 It was likely\
  \ that the RPO's unfamiliarity of the local area contributed to the \nmisunderstanding.\
  \  During the interview, the RPO stated that he had pa rtially filled the \nMis\
  \ 71 Track Occupation Cross Check form before arriving on -site. The Mis 71 showed\
  \ \nthe 'work between limit ' as Eureka 8L Signal and blocking applied at Eureka\
  \ 8R Signal. \nThese limits were in conflict with the work between limit at Ruaku\
  \ ra 8L and blocking at \nRuakura 8R Signal authorised by the train controller .\
  \   \n3.23 Once t he RPO had possession of the track occupation authority , valid\
  \  until 0800, both \nthe RPO and the  HRV operator discussed the working limits\
  \ and a greed that the \nrecommended of f-tracking location would be at a farmer\
  \ 's private access track at \nabout the 9.35 km mark . The agreed off-tracking\
  \ location  was about 3 km outside the \nlimit of the  PWA , thereby potentially\
  \ putting the HRV into the path of the next train \ntravelling towards Te Rapa ,\
  \ Hamilton .  \n3.24 Witness statements confirmed the HRV voluntarily cleared the\
  \ track at about 0750, 10 \nminutes before the authorised 'clear by' time of 0800.\
  \ However, at the time of clearing \nthe track the HRV was 3 km outside the limits\
  \ of the  PWA .   \n3.25 The train was travelling at 60  kilometres per hour . Had\
  \ the HRV remained on -track until \n0800 , the time agreed between the train controller\
  \  and RPO on the Mis 71 Track \nOccupation Cross Check form , it would  likely\
  \ have been struck by the train at about \n0752.    \n \nMis 71  \n3.26 The Mis\
  \ 71 is a Track Occupation Cross Check form which i s completed as part of the \n\
  procedure for  request ing blocking .  \nTC is the authority for authorising track\
  \ occupation. Whoever is requesting track \noccupation is required to complete an\
  \ Mis 71. Along with other information , \nthe form should contain the instructions\
  \ issued by the train controller  at the \ntime of request (see Appendix 1). \n\
  \ \nFinal Report RO -2020 -104 | 12 3.27 At the time of this incident there was\
  \ an instruction  in place preventing the RPO \ncompleting the form before making\
  \ the request. On 12 February 2020, about seven \nmonths prior to the incident,\
  \ KiwiRail had promulgated Semi -Permanent Bulletin No. \n124 (see Appendix 2),\
  \  which state d that the only information that could be pre -\ncompleted on all\
  \ Operating and Authority documents  (which included Mis 71 s) was the \naddressee,\
  \ location and date.   \n3.28 Had the RPO completed the Mis 71 form during the process\
  \ of request ing track \noccupation with th e train controller , instead of pre\
  \ -completing earlier that morning, it \nis likely  that the discrepancy may have\
  \ been identified  and the error rectified .  \n \nNon-technical skills  \nSafety\
  \ issue - Implementation of an administrative control measure designed to provide\
  \ \nprotection for a track worker was unsuccessful due to the poor use of non -technical\
  \ skills.   \n3.29 Non-technical skills can be defined as the cognitive, social\
  \ and personal resource skills \nthat complement technical skills and contribute\
  \ to safe and effective task performance. \nSub-categories of non -technical skills\
  \ include situational awareness, conscientiousness, \ncommunication, decision -making\
  \ and action, teamwork, workload management  and \nself-management.  \n3.30 The\
  \ train controller  and the RPO had both undergone training in non -technical skills.\
  \ \nNevertheless, human error will occur,  and this incident highlights the importance\
  \ of \nusing  effective communication strategies to guard against such occurrences.\
  \ The \nlikelihood of erroneous read -backs (hear -back error) is increased when\
  \ those \ncommunicating have a preconceived notion of what they are expecting to\
  \ hear. Whil e \nexpectation bias6 cannot necessarily be eliminated, defences (such\
  \ as specific  \nphraseology and challenge -respond techniques ) go some way to\
  \ ensur ing a complete \nand correct understanding is shared by both parties.  \n\
  3.31 Good communication is a key function of  safety within the rail industry .\
  \ There were \nseveral examples in th is incident whe re the use of good communication\
  \ skills would \nhave helped to establish a common mental model of the blocking\
  \ protection that was \nbeing requested. Had instructions  been repeated back  clearly\
  \ , and the ir accuracy \nchalleng ed, a serious error could have potentially been\
  \ identified and very likely  \nrectified .   \n3.32 On this occasion Rule 908 \
  \ - Blocking was the required procedure to achieve a PWA . \nHowever, the process\
  \  was unsuccessful because of the poor use of non -technical skills  \nbetw een\
  \ participants  which did  not detect the error and provide an opportunity to \n\
  rectify it.    \n \n6 Expectation  bias is the predisposition for individuals to\
  \ perceive information according to what they are \nexpecting to see/hear, as opposed\
  \ to what is actually seen/heard. This expectancy can make it less likely that any\
  \ \nmismatch in the information received is detected.  \n \n \n  Final Report RO\
  \ -2020 -104 \n<< Page 13 >>\n Rail protection officer  \n3.33 'Rail protection\
  \ officer' is a generic term given to the person responsible for protecting \nindividuals\
  \ or multiple worksites , depending on the level of competency held. That \nperson\
  \ has overall responsibility for communicating with TC and coordinating the \nmovement\
  \ of trains and HRVs through and within the work area.  \n3.34 On this occasion\
  \ the RPO was providing protection for the o perator  of a HRV in an \narea he was\
  \ unfamiliar with and which, under  the Rule 908 - Blocking process, was \nlikely\
  \ to be the  reason he did not question the train controller 's read -back of the\
  \ \nmeterage and locations they intended to block.   \n3.35 Operators of HRVs are\
  \ required by KiwiRail to be location certified. KiwiRail's Track \nSafety Rule\
  \ 116 (b) state s in part:  \nDriver without local knowledge : \"Where for some\
  \ reason the driver is not a \nperson with adequate local knowledge, the driver\
  \ must be accompanied by a \nsecond person with such knowledge, who holds the appropriate\
  \ licence to \noperate .\"  \n3.36 Although the cause of this incident may have\
  \ been rectified by the use of good non -\ntechnical skills , the RPO's lack of\
  \ familiarity with the area was a limitation.  Currently , \nlocal knowledge  is\
  \ not a requirement for RPOs , but given their overall responsibility for \nproviding\
  \ rail protection within a PWA , a good understanding and knowledge of the \nlocal\
  \ area  may well influence their decision -making and actions. It is a  constraint\
  \ that \nshould be considered by rail operator s when planning similar operations\
  \ in the future.  \nEngineering  control measures  \nSafety issue - The use of an\
  \ administrative control  measure was not  effective  on its own , and \nthe adoption\
  \ of engineering control measures when establishing PWA s would provide an \nenhanced\
  \ level of protection for track workers.  \n3.37 From 1 June 2019 until 31 May 2021\
  \ , KiwiRail recorded 61 track occupancy \nirregularities . Twenty -one of the irregularities\
  \ were due to a discrepancy between the \nauthority and the location  on-site and\
  \ poor communication  was considered  to be  a \ncontributing factor .7  \n3.38\
  \ The Health and Safety at W ork (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations\
  \ \n2016 require a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking to identify hazards\
  \ and \nprotect against them  using a hierarchy of control measures (see Figure\
  \ 6), to maintain \nand review the control measure s, and to provide information,\
  \ supervision, training and \ninstruction to workers.  \n \n \n \n7 Track occupancy\
  \ statistics provide by KiwiRail at the request of the Com mission . \n \nFinal\
  \ Report RO -2020 -104 | 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Recommended\
  \ hierarchy of safety controls  \n \n3.39 Figure 6 explains the effectiveness of\
  \ the various safety control measures that may be \nused to help reduce the risk\
  \ to workers. In this incident , the primary safety control was \nan administrative\
  \ control and relied upon those involved following Rule 908 - Blocking \ncompleting\
  \ the correct paperwork, communicating effectively  and identify ing the \ncorrect\
  \ signals to isolate. If the process is  administrated correctly then blockin g\
  \ control \nis successfully achieved.  \n3.40 However, as can be seen from the number\
  \ of track occupancy irregularities, 21 were \ndue to a discrepancy between the\
  \ authority and  the location on -site. In the hierarchy \nof safety controls ,\
  \ it is eviden t that administrative controls are the leas t effective and \ncan\
  \ fail to provide the protection that track workers  (working in the rail corridor\
  \ and \nfaced with the danger of trains moving through their worksite ) require.\
  \  \n3.41 On this occasion there were no fatalities or injuries, but the incident\
  \ provides an \nopportunity to learn important safety lessons and try to prevent\
  \ a future reoccurrence. \nAdministrative controls can be effective whe n implemented\
  \ correctly . However , given \nthe serious consequence s of an accident occurring\
  \ in the rail corridor, more effective \nengineering controls should ideally  be\
  \ the preferred option to reduce the frequency of \nsimilar accidents occurring\
  \ in the future.    \n3.42 The Com mission has made a recommendation to the Chief\
  \ Executive of KiwiRail to \nprovide an enhanced level of protection for track workers\
  \  by adopting the use of \nengineering control measures when establishing PWAs\
