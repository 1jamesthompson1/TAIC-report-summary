","The train controller made an assumption about the location of the passenger train and did not confirm this location before authorising the person-in-charge's track occupation. Assumptions made by train controllers about the locations of trains and other rail vehicles are a real and constant risk that must be continually and properly managed.

","The passenger train was not electronically visible to the train controller when he authorised the person-in-charge's track occupation.

","The train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before the incident. Train controllers who do not eat properly and regularly during their shifts and/or who do not take rest breaks during their shifts may become mentally fatigued. In these circumstances, train controllers are more likely to make mistakes.

2011_106,025/13,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place, and are being applied, to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions about the locations of trains and other rail vehicles.","The train controller in this case made an assumption that the passenger train had passed a particular location based on information from the person-in-charge. Rather than verifying the train's location, the train controller acted on his assumption and authorised the person-in-charge to occupy a section of track that the passenger train was approaching.

Train controllers must not make assumptions about the locations of trains without first verifying their locations. Unless KiwiRail and train controllers remain alert to this risk and take all appropriate steps to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions, further incidents could occur, perhaps with more serious consequences.
