  \ train nearly collided with the hi -rail vehicle because  the train controller\
  \ \nmistakenly authoris ed the person -in-charge to place a hi-rail vehicle and\
  \ hi-rail excavator on to \nthe section of track on which the passenger train was\
  \ travelling .  The train controller made this \nmistak e because he did not verify\
  \ the location of the passenger train .  He made an \nassumption  based on what\
  \ he was told by  the person -in-charge of the worksite that a \"subby\", \nwhich\
  \ he assumed was the passenger train, had already and only just passed his locatio\
  \ n.  \nThe passenger train was in fact about 2  minutes away, approaching  the\
  \ Crown Road  level \ncrossing where the person -in-charge had begun to on -track\
  \ his hi-rail vehicle.  \n4.1.2.  This incident highligh ted 3 safety issues , namely:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 assumptions about the location s of the trains  - the train controller\
  \ made an assumption \nabout the location of the passenger train and did not verify\
  \  this location before authorising \nthe person -in-charge's track occupation.\
  \  Assumptions by train controllers about the \nlocation s of trains and other rail\
  \ vehicles are a real and constant risk  that must be \ncontinu ally and properly\
  \ managed  \n\uF0B7 knowing where trains are on the rail network  - the passenger\
  \ train was not electronically \nvisible to the train controller when he authorised\
  \ the person -in-charge's track occupation.  \nA significant portion  of the controlled\
  \ rail network  and therefore a large number  of rail \nmovements and track activities\
  \  are not electronically  visible to train control  at any given \ntime .  Although\
  \ mechanisms are available to help train controllers anticipate and verify \nthese\
  \ movements and track activities , these mechanisms require train controllers to\
  \ \ninterpret, analyse and understand information  (or the absence of information)\
  \ , often in  \nsplit-second s and while under pressure.  This makes their job complex\
  \ and demanding.  A \nhigh reliance on human input means that the system will always\
  \ be a t risk from human \nerror .  The Commission raised this issue in its Staircase/Craigieburn\
  \  report4 \n\uF0B7 nutrition and rest breaks  - the train controller had not eaten\
  \ for about 15 hours before \nthe incident.  T rain controllers who do not eat properly\
  \ and regularly during their shift s \nand/or who do not take rest breaks during\
  \ their shift s may become mentally fatig ued, \nwhich can contribute to their making\
  \ errors.  The Commission  also raised this issue in its \nStaircase/Craigieburn\
  \ report .  Although there is no objective evidence to support the train \ncontroller's\
  \ mental performance  being  affected by the lack of rest breaks or the lack of\
  \ \nfood before and during his shift, research has shown that insufficient nutrition\
  \ can \nnevertheless affect human performance.   \n4.1.3.  Each of these safety\
  \ issues is discussed in the following sections . \n4.2. Assumptions  about the\
  \ location s of trains and other rail vehicles  \nSafety issue:  The train controller\
  \ made an assumption about the location of the passenger \ntrain and did not confirm\
  \ this location before authorising the person -in-charge's track \noccupation. \
  \ Assumptio ns made by train controllers about the location s of trains and other\
  \ rail \nvehicles are a real and constant risk  that must be continu ally and properly\
  \ managed.  \n4.2.1.  KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules required train controllers to\
  \ verify all train movements before \ngranting track occupation authorisations.\
  \  Rule 915(b) stated:  \nTrain Control will ensure that the proposed movement will\
  \ not conflict with rail vehicle \nmovements (trains, hi -rail vehicles, etc). \
  \ \nThe location of conflicting rail vehicle movements must be verified by Train\
  \ Control prior to the \nmovement being authorised5. \n                        \
  \                                \n4  Commission report 11 -102.  \n5  Rule 915(b),\
  \ Rail Operating Rules: Section 9: Track Safety Rules.  Ontrack.   25 November 2008.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report 11 -106 4.2.2.  Rule 915(b)(i) was specifically\
  \ concerned with on -tracking.  It stated:  \nWhen a train is in the vicinity where\
  \ the on tracking is to take place:  \nTrain control must verify that train's position\
  \ to ensure that it has [passed ] the on -tracking location, \nprior to authorising\
  \ the Trolley /Hi -rail movement.  \n4.2.3.  These rules were further repeated in\
  \ KiwiRail's Operating Instructions for Train Control6.  \nClause 14.1.2, for example,\
  \ stated:  \nPre Authorisation check and use of Train Control Diagram for Track\
  \ Occupancy  \nBefore track occupation is authorised the Train Controller must establish\
  \ positively whether any \nconflict exists with either existing occupations, tra\
  \ ck maintenance machinery or trains within any \npart of the area requested.  \n\
  All movements and work authorised must be plotted on the Train Control Diagram as\
  \ prescribed in \ninstruction 2.1 and 2.2 [plotting convention]  \n4.2.4.  On 13\
  \ April 2011 (about 7 months before the incident) KiwiRail issued a safety briefing\
  \ notice \nto train control personnel reminding them about the importance of verifying\
  \ train movements \nbefore granting track occupation authorisations.  This safety\
  \ briefing notice was issued \nfollowing potential conflicts, which had been created\
  \ as a result of train controllers authorising \ntrack occupations.  The safety\
  \ briefing notice specifically alerted personnel to the danger of \nmaking assumptions\
  \ about the location s of trains without verifying where they were .  It \nconcluded\
  \ by saying:  \nIn summary, be aware that you can make semi -conscious assumptions\
  \ and believe that it is safe \nto authorise occupancy when it is not.  The defence\
  \ is to consistently apply checks fully with \nverification, and then verbalise\
  \ what yo u understand and are authorising.  \n4.2.5.  The train controller made\
  \ 3 assumptions7 based on the comment from  the person -in-charge \nthat \" A subby\
  \ has just gone past on the Down Main \". \n\uF0B7 he assumed that  the \"subby\
  \ \" was in fact the passenger train when in fact it was th e \ntraining shuttle\
  \  \n\uF0B7 he assumed that the passenger train (which was actually the training\
  \ shuttle) had only just \npassed the Crown Road level crossing on the Down Main\
  \ line, when in fact it had done so \nseveral minutes earlier  \n\uF0B7 he assumed\
  \ that the Down Main line between the Crown Road level crossing and Signal D \n\
  was now clear for a 30 -minute track occupation for the person -in-charge to travel\
  \ on , \nwhen it was not.  \n4.2.6.  The train controller made these assumptions\
  \ because he thought  that the person -in-charge's \ncommen t, \"A subby has just\
  \ gone past on the Down Main \", meant that the passenger train \nhad just gone\
  \ past that second , rather than a few minutes earlier .  Th e request for the track\
  \ \noccupation was made within a few minutes of the time the train controller expecte\
  \ d the \npassenger train to be passing  the Crown Road level crossing.  \n4.2.7.\
  \  Despite KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules and the safety briefing notice , the train\
  \ controller did not \nverify the location of the passenger train , but instead\
  \ relied on his assumptions  about  what \ntrain was being referred to, and that\
  \ it had just gone past .  In his submission to the \nCommission, the train controller\
  \ implied  that relying on the practice of field staff providing \nadditional information\
  \  to train controllers was normal practice.  He im plied that in this case, \n\
  relying on the information that the \"subby had just gone past\" was appropriate.\
  \   However, \ntrain controllers must use all means available to verify the locations\
  \ of trains before \nauthorising track occupations.  \n                        \
  \                                \n6  Rail Operating Procedures: Section 10.1: Operating\
  \ Instructions for Train Control.  Ontrack.  23 November \n2009.  \n7  The Concise\
  \ Oxford English Dictionary (11th edition) defines an \"assumption\" as something\
  \ that is \naccepted as true wit hout proof.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -106 \n<< Page\
  \ 9 >>\n 4.2.8.  The risk of human error will always be present whenever a process\
  \ or a system requires a \nperson to make a decision or to perform an act.  This\
  \ risk can be effectively managed and \nminimised if the right level of attention\
  \ and commitment is given to it.  \n4.2.9.  Train controllers must not make assumptions.\
  \  They should only act on verified information.  \nKiwiRail could ensure that train\
  \ controllers do not make assumptions by the following means : \n\uF0B7 repeatedly\
  \ reminding train controllers (through regular safety briefing notices or \nannouncements)\
  \ to follow proper protocols when authorising track occupations, including \nverifying\
  \ the location s of trains and other hi -rail vehicles rather than relying on \n\
  assumptions  \n\uF0B7 locating visual reminders throughout train control (e.g. on\
  \ p osters or messages in each \ntrain control room and in the common areas) reminding\
  \ train controllers not to make \nassumptions  \n\uF0B7 ensuring that train controllers'\
  \ formal training (initial and ongoing training) covers the risks \nof making assumptions\
  \ and include s strategies to help train controllers avoid making \nthem . \n4.2.10.\
  \  Managing the risk of train controllers making assumptions should be a daily priority,\
  \ not an \noccasional exercise.  \nFindings  \n1. The train controller authorised\
  \ a track occupation o n a section of track in fr ont of \nan advancing passenger\
  \ train because he did not first check the whereabouts of all \nother trains in\
  \ the area as required by KiwiRail rules and procedures.  \n2. The train controller\
  \ did not check  the location of the passenger train because he \nmade an assum\
  \ ption about its location,  based on additional information given  by \nthe person\
  \ -in-charge  of the track maintenance  group .   \n3. KiwiRail must take all available\
  \ steps to ensure  that train controllers do not make \nassumptions.  Train controllers\
  \ must authorise tra ck occupations on verified \ninformation only.  \n4. The person\
  \ -in-charge provided additional information when he said , \"A subby has \njust\
  \ gone past on the Down Main\".  This information confused the train controller\
  \ . \n4.3. Knowing where trains are on the rail network  \nSafety issue:  The passenger\
  \ train was not electronically visible to the train controller when he \nauthorised\
  \ the person -in-charge's track occupation.  A significant portion of the controlled\
  \ rail \nnetwork, and therefore a large number  of rail movements and track activitie\
  \ s, is not \nelectronically visible to train control at any given time.  \n4.3.1.\
  \  In New Zeal and, only about 40 % of the entire controlled rail network  is configured\
  \ to display \nthe location s of trains on train controllers ' mimic screen s. \
  \ For areas under track warrant \ncontrol this has become colloquially  know n as\
  \ \"dark territory \".  This term is used in this report \nto describe any area\
  \ that is not visible on a mimic screen.  In order to monitor  rail movements \n\
  and track activities  on a section  of track (particularly within  dark territory)\
  \ , train controllers rely \non a number of mechanisms, including their paper -based\
  \ train control diagram s, information \nfrom the electronic train register, compulsory\
  \ radio calls from train drivers confirming their \nlocations,  and the read -back\
  \ .  \n4.3.2.  Not all of these mechanisms, however,  can provide a train controller\
  \  with the exact location s \nof all rail vehicles throughout dark territory ;\
  \ usually only their most likely  location s.  Also,  in \norder to determine this\
  \ likely location, a train controller must  interpret , analys e and \nunderstand\
  \  not only  information  that they see or receive from these various mechanisms\
  \ but \nalso information that may not be obvious because, for example, it may not\
  \ be displayed on a \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report 11 -106 mimic screen .  Based\
  \ on this inf ormation (or the absence of it) , a train controller must then \n\
  form a view about where a train or other rail vehicle is  on the controlled rail\
  \ network at any \ngiven time .   \n4.3.3.  In this case, the train controller said\
  \ that he had checked his mimic screen before issuing the \ntrack occupation authorisation\
  \ , and saw the training shuttle travelling on the Up Main line.  \nHowever , for\
  \ some reason (which the train controller said he could not explain) he did not\
  \ \nregister the fact that the passenger train was not displayed on his mimic  screen.\
  \  The absence \nof the passenger train from the mimic screen was important .  It\
  \ was telling the train controller \n(albeit in a complicated way) that the passenger\
  \ train was still travelling through  dark territory  \nbetween Signal A and Signal\
  \ B .  This m eant that:    \n\uF0B7 the passenger train had not yet passed  the\
  \ Crown Road  level crossing, as the train \ncontroller had assumed  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ section of track between  the Crown Road  level crossing and Signal D was not\
  \ free for \nthe person -in-charge to on-track his hi -rail vehicle and hi -rail\
  \ excavator.  \n4.3.4.  Figure 1 shows the Up Main line and the Down Main line between\
  \ Papakura and Pukekohe, \nand the location of the Crown Road  level crossing near\
  \ Paerata.  It also shows the 4 signals \nbetween Papakura and Paerata : \n\uF0B7\
  \ the 44 signal (645.59  km) south of Papakura ( Signal A ) \n\uF0B7 the 636.55\
  \  km interm ediate signal ( Signal B ) \n\uF0B7 the 634.71  km intermediate signal\
  \ north of the Crown Road  level crossing ( Signal C ) \n\uF0B7 the 8L signal (632.97\
  \  km) south of the Crown Road  level crossing near Paerata ( Signal D ).  \nThis\
  \ signal identifie d the boundary between Auckland and  Waikato train control. \
  \ \nFigure 1 \nUp Main line and Down Main line from Papakura to Pukekohe  \n \n\
  4.3.5.  Trains travelling between Signal B and Pukekohe were continuously displayed\
  \ on the mimic \nscreen, enabling train controllers to see where they were.  However,\
  \ trains travelling between \nSignal A and Signal B were not, meaning that their\
  \ movements on this section of track \n(approximately 9  km long) were not electronically\
  \ visible to train control (dark territory).  In \nthese cases, train control lers\
  \ had to anticipate train movement s by plotting  progress on their \npaper train\
  \ control diagram s, with the help of other information such as information from\
  \ the \ntrain register.  \n4.3.6.  When the location s of train s are not electronically\
  \ visible to train controll ers, it can be  difficult \nfor them  to interpret and\
  \ understand the significance of information, particular ly when they \n \n \nPaerata\

  \  The Commission is aware that global position ing technology is available \nwithin\
  \ KiwiRail that will enable train controllers to see a ll train movements in real\
  \ time.  \nHowever, this technology has not been formally introduced as an aid to\
  \ controlling trains \nacross the entire rail network .  If the train co ntroller\
  \ in this case could have seen  in real time  \nall train movements between Auckland\
  \ and Pukekohe, and  if he had looked  at the screen \nbefore issuing the track\
  \ occupa tion authority to the person -in-charge, he would have seen that \nthe\
  \ passenger train had not passed the Crown Road level crossing.  \n4.3.7.  This\
  \ does not mean  that the mechanisms that train control uses  to monitor rail movements\
  \ \nand track activities  on the controlled rail network are  inadequate  for tracking\
  \ trains and other \nrail vehicles or for determ ining their location s.  The fact\
  \ that the majority of rail movements \nand track activities  have op erated on\
  \ the network without incident  supports this.  However,  \nthese mechanisms  do\
  \ require more input from train controllers , who must interpret and \nanalyse the\
  \ information that these mechanisms provide  or do not show .   \n4.3.8.  A train\
  \ controller's job would be easier , and public safety would be improved , if all\
  \ trains and \nhi-rail vehicles on the controlled rail network  were electronic\
  \ ally visible to them at all times.  \nThat way they could see at a glance all\
  \ rail movements and track activities  on a particular \nsection of track at any\
  \ given time.  Train visibility through global positioning technology  will \nreduce\
  \ the risk of collisions o ccurring .   \n4.3.9.  Since this incident, KiwiRail\
  \ has developed a system that shows train controllers the locations \nof all trains\
  \ over 95% of its controlled network with a reasonable level of accuracy.  The \n\
  system , known as \"GeVis\" , uses global positioning technol ogy.  A similar system\
  \ using global \npositioning technology to identify the locations of all hi -rail\
  \ vehicles is currently being \ndesigned .    \nFindings  \n5. The passenger train\
  \ was not displayed on the train controller's mimic screen when \nhe authorised\
  \ the person -in-charge's track occupation.  A visual representation of \nthe passenger\
  \ train's location  would have reduced the risk of the train controller \ninadvertently\
  \ creating a potential collision between the passenger train and the hi -\nrail\
  \ vehicles . \n6. Train controllers must determine where trains and other rail vehicles\
  \ are on the \ncontrolled rail network at any given time, by interpreting, analysing\
  \ and \nunderstanding  not only  information that they see but also information\
  \ that is not \nobvious or displayed .  A train controller's job would be made easier\
  \ , and public \nsafety would be improved,  if all trains and hi -rail vehicles\
  \ were electronically visible \nto train control  at all times.  If the train controller\
  \ had had access to this technology \nat the time of the in cident , he would have\
  \ seen (at a glance) that it was not safe to \nauthorise the person -in-charge's\
  \ track occupation.  This would have prevented the \nincident occurring.  \n4.4.\
  \ Train controller wellbeing  - nutrition and rest breaks  \nSafety issue:  The\
  \ train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before the \nincident.\
  \  Train controllers who do not eat properly and regularly during their shift s\
  \ and/or \nwho do not take rest breaks during their shift s may become mentally\
  \ fatigued.  In these \ncircumstances, train controllers are more likely to make\
  \ mistakes .  \n4.4.1.  Train control is a mentally demanding  and stressful  role.\
  \ Train controllers are required to \nmake  numerous quick  decisions during their\
  \ shifts  and t o get these right  all the time .  To do \nthis train controllers\
  \  must  be in peak mental form throughout their shift s.  A lapse of \nconcentrati\
  \ on could result in an accident , with consequent loss of life and/or significant\
  \ \ndamage to property  and/or the environment .   \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report\
  \ 11 -106 4.4.2.  To ensure that train controllers are mentally and physically fit\
  \ to perform their duties, the \nCommission believes that there  are 2 basic , but\
  \ important,  principles  that train controllers \nmust  follow as a matter of standard\
  \ practi ce, namely : \n\uF0B7 train controllers must have sufficient  nutrition\
  \ before  and regularly during their shifts  \n\uF0B7 train controllers must take\
  \ regular rest breaks .  \n4.4.3.  Research shows that in order for the brain to\
  \ sustain optimal performance, the body needs a \nspecific lev el of glucose.  Food\
  \  is a key  way to provide the body with this.   A modest reduction \nin available\
  \ glucose (through inadequate nutrition) can have a measurable effect on the speed\
  \ \nwith which the brain responds to, and processes, information (De Feo et al.,\
  \ 1988).  \n4.4.4.  In this case, the train controller's most recent  meal had been\
  \  about 15 hours before the \nincident  (i.e. his dinner the night before ).  When\
  \ he awoke around 0445 on the day of the \nincident , he did not have breakfast\
  \ .  Nor could he recall eating anything at work before the \nincident.  In both\
  \ cases the train controller  chose not to  eat, at least intentionally in the first\
  \ \ncase because he preferred  not to have breakfast so early, and  in the second\
  \ case  because he  \nhad not yet got around to doing  so. \n4.4.5.  The train controller\
  \ said that about 4 0 minutes before the incident he had had a mild \nheadache ,\
  \ although it was not severe enough for him to consider discontinuing his shift\
  \ .  He  \nnevertheless  had told the Network Control Manager  about it, then returned\
  \ t o his desk  to \ncontinue his work .  Once the Network Control Manager was aware\
  \ of the train controller's \nailment, he had a responsibility to determine the\
  \ extent of the ailment and put in place a \nprocess to monitor the train controller's\
  \ wellbeing.  In this case no such action was taken.     \n4.4.6.  It is unclear\
  \ if  the train controller's headache was due to  his lack of food intake or some\
  \ other \nfactor .  It is also unclear  if his headache  affected his performance\
  \ in any way (there was no \nevidence to enable the  Commis sion to determine this\
  \ ).  Given that the train controller had not \nconsumed any food for about 15 hours\
  \ before he made his error, low blood glucose levels \ncould not be excluded as\
  \ a factor contributing to his performance.  \n4.4.7.  Train controllers have a\
  \ responsib ility to ensure that they are mentally fit to perform their \nduties.\
  \  This means eating properly and regularly  during  shifts.  This is not something\
  \ that train \ncontrollers should  treat  casually or with indifference , because\
  \  they are performing a safety -\ncritical role  that requires high mental and\
  \ cognitive  performance .   \n4.4.8.  KiwiRail  also has a responsibility  to ensure\
  \ that its train controllers  are properly educated  to \ntreat  diet and nutritio\
  \ n seriously .  It also has a responsibility to ensure  that they have  \nopportunit\
  \ ies to rest and take in nutrition .  Safety briefings and safety notices reminding\
  \ train \ncontrollers of the importance of proper nutrition are important .  \n\
  4.4.9.  Rest breaks were  a matter that the Commission examined in its Staircase\
  \ -Craigieburn rail \ninquiry8.  In that case the train controller 's significant\
  \ work load meant that she felt she could \nnot leave her room during  her 5 -hour\
  \ shift to get something to eat  or to have a break .  The \nCommission found that\
  \ it was likely that the train controller , in that case, was mentally \nfatigued\
  \  immediately before, and  at the time, she made an error . \n4.4.10.  Standard\
  \ protocol within train control is not to provide train controllers with scheduled\
  \ breaks \nwithin their shifts  because of the need for them to be near their desk\
  \ s at all times to hear and \nrespond to calls.  Rather, the practice is for informal\
  \ breaks and interactions, including meal, \ntoilet and  rest breaks , to be  taken\
  \ as and when opportunit ies arise, mainly during quiet \nperiod s.  In most  cases\
  \ then, train controllers eat at their desks, and have rest and toilet \nbreaks\
  \ as and when their workloads allow them to.  \n                               \
  \                         \n8  Commission re port 11 -102.  \n  \nFinal report 11\
  \ -106 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.4.11.  The Accident Investigation Board in Norway and\
  \ Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited9 \nboth confirmed similar arrangements\
  \ in t heir respective countries , where train controller shifts \nare 8 ho urs\
  \ without scheduled breaks.  \n4.4.12.  Notwithstanding this, there are risks when\
  \  people who perform safety -critical  functions work  \nlong hours without scheduled\
  \ breaks, particularly if the work required is complex and mentally \ndemanding\
  \ , such as train control.  The fact that someone else may be doing the same thing\
  \ is \nnot a good reason  for continuing with a high -risk procedure involvi ng\
  \ a safety -critical  function .  \n4.4.13.  There is a wealth of cases in which\
  \ long and irregular working hours have contributed to \npeople making errors or\
  \ that have been associated with a range of physical and mental health \nand injury\
  \ risks (International Labour Organisation , 2011).  Eight hours without a scheduled\
  \ \nbreak is a long time in which to expect a person to remain fully alert and in\
  \ optimal mental \nform.  \n4.4.14.  The Commission does not accept that KiwiRail's\
  \ approach to train control, where its train \ncontrollers work their 8-hour shift\
  \ s10 without scheduled breaks, is safe - certainly  not without \nproper processes\
  \ in place to manage and mitigate the risk s of workplace fatigue and stress  \n\
  effectively .  This is a significant  safety issue that must  be properly assessed\
  \  from a risk \nperspective . \n4.4.15.  KiwiRail has since introduced a range\
  \ of measures to improve the health and wellbeing of its \ntrain controllers.  These\
  \ are detailed i n the \"Safety action s\" section of this report.  \nFinding s\
  \  \n7. Given that the train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours\
  \ \nbefore he made his error , low blood glucose levels could not be excluded  as\
  \ a \nfactor contributing to the train controller's performance.  \n8. Train controllers\
  \ must ensure that they eat properly and regularly during shifts.  \nThis cannot\
  \ be treated casually or w ith indifference , when they are performing \nsuch a\
  \ safety -critical  role.   \n9. KiwiRail must ensure that train controllers treat\
  \ diet and nutrition seriously, that \nfood is easily accessible by train controllers\
  \ during their shifts and that train \ncontrollers are given breaks to rest and\
  \ have adequate nutrition .   \n10. KiwiRail's approach  to train control, where\
  \ its train controllers work 8 -hour shift s \nwithout scheduled breaks, is not\
  \ safe unless processes are in place to manage \nand mitigate the risks of fatigue\
  \ and stress  effectively .  \n \n4.5. Communication  \n4.5.1.  This incident highlights\
  \ the importance of clear communication and the need for train \ncontrollers, and\
  \ those who communicate with train control, to check and clarify their \nunderstanding\
  \ of communications.  \n4.5.2.  The driver of the passenger train said that he had\
  \ not hear d the train controlle r authorising the \nperson -in-charge to occupy\
  \ the section of track ahead of his train , even though he had been  \non the same\
  \ radio frequency.  He said that he had reduced the volume on his train radio and\
  \ \nhad trained himself to focus only on those calls made to his call sign, and\
  \ to ignore all other \nradio communications.  Although there was no rule requiring\
  \ the train driver to listen to all \n                                         \

  \ best practice and good crew resource management11 dictated that he \nand other\
  \ drivers do this.  The fact that he did not \"tune in \" to the radio conversation\
  \ between \nthe train controller and the person -in-charge in this case meant that\
  \ an opportunity was lost to \nalert train control to the potential conflic t involving\
  \ his own train.  \n4.5.3.  The Commission made reference to the need for good communication\
  \ and crew resource \nmanagement in its report on a near -head -on collision near\
  \ Papakura on  14 January 2011 .  In \nthat report the Commission recommended that\
  \ the Chief E xecutive of the NZ Transport Agency \nrequire the Executive of the\
  \ National Rail System Standard to develop standards to ensure \nthat all rail participants\
  \ meet a consistently high level of crew resource management and \ncommunication\
  \ that includes the use of s tandard rail phraseology.  \n4.5.4.  On 16 April 2012\
  \ the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency replied that he intended to \n\
  work closely with the National Rail System Standard Executive with an aim of implementing\
  \ \nand closing out this recommendation as soon as p racticable.  He also said that\
  \ the NZ \nTransport Agency sat on the National Rail System Standard  Executive\
  \ as an observer and that \nhe would  also consider a strategy for rail operators\
  \ outside the National Rail System Standard  \ncoverage.  \n4.5.5.  The recommendation\

  \ The passenger train driver could have heard the train controller authorising a\
  \ track \noccupation directly in the path of his train and intervened to prevent\
  \ the conflict, \nbut he lost that oppo rtunity because he routinely turned down\
  \ the volume on his \ntrain radio and only actively listened for radio traffic in\
  \ which  his train number was \nmentioned.  \n                                 \
  \                       \n11  Crew resource management can be defined as a management\
  \ system that makes optimum use of all \navailable resources (e.g. equipment, procedures\
  \ and people) to promote safety and enhance the \nefficiency of operations.  It\
  \ encompasses a wide range of knowledge, skills and attitudes , including \ncommunications,\
  \ situational awarene ss, problem -solving, decision -making and teamwork.   \n\
  \ \n  \nFinal report 11 -106 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 5. Findings  \n5.1. The train controller\
  \ authorised a track occupation on a section of track in front of an \nadvancing\
  \ passenger train because he did not first check the whereabouts of all other trains\
  \ \nin the area as required by KiwiRail rules and procedures.  \n5.2. The trai n\
  \ controller did not check the location of the passenger train because he made an\
  \ \nassumption about its location , based on additional information given  by the\
  \ person -in-charge \nof the track maintenance group.   \n5.3. KiwiRail must take\
  \ all available steps to ensur e that train controllers do not make \nassumptions.\
  \  Train controllers must authorise track occupations on verified information only.\
  \  \n5.4. The person -in-charge provided additional information when he said , \"\
  A subby has just gone \npast on the Down Main\".  This info rmation confused the\
  \ train controller.  \n5.5. The passenger train was not displayed on the train controller's\
  \ mimic screen when he \nauthorised the person -in-charge's track occupation.  A\
  \ visual representation of the passenger \ntrain's location would have reduced th\
  \ e risk of the train controller inadvertently creating a \npotential collision\
  \ between the passenger train and the hi -rail vehicles.  \n5.6. Train controllers\
  \ must determine where trains and other rail vehicles are on the controlled rail\
  \ \nnetwork at any given time, by  interpreting, analysing and understanding  not\
  \ only  information \nthat they see but also information that is not obvious or\
  \ displayed.  A train controller's job \nwould be made easier, and public safety\
  \ would be improved, if all trains and hi -rail vehicles \nwere electronically visible\
  \ to train control at all times.  If the train controller  had had access to \n\
  this technology at the time of the incident , he would have seen (at a glance) that\
  \ it was not \nsafe to authorise the person -in-charge's track occupation.  Thi\
  \ s would have prevented the \nincident occurring.  \n5.7. Given that the train\
  \ controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before he made \nhis error\
  \ , low blood glucose levels could not be excluded as a factor contributing to the\
  \ train \ncontroller's performa nce. \n5.8. Train controllers must ensure that they\
  \ eat properly and regularly during shifts.  This cannot be \ntreated casually or\
  \ with indifference , when they are performing such a safety -critical  role.  \
  \ \n5.9. KiwiRail must ensure that train controllers treat diet and  nutrition seriously,\
  \ that food is easily \naccessible by train controllers during their shifts and\
  \ that train controllers are given breaks to \nrest and have adequate nutrition.\
  \   \n5.10.  KiwiRail's approach to train control, where its train controllers work\
  \ 8 -hour s hifts without \nscheduled breaks, is not safe unless processes are in\
  \ place to manage and mitigate the risks \nof fatigue and stress  effectively .\
  \  \n5.11.  The passenger train driver could have heard the train controller authorising\
  \ a track occupation \ndirectly in the p ath of his train and intervened to prevent\
  \ the conflict, but he lost that \nopportunity because he routinely turned down\
  \ the volume on his train radio and only actively \nlistened for radio traffic in\
  \ which  his train number was mentioned.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
