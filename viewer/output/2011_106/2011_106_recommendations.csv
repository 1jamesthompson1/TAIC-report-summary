2011_106,025/13,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place, and are being applied, to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions about the locations of trains and other rail vehicles.","The train controller in this case made an assumption that the passenger train had passed a particular location based on information from the person-in-charge. Rather than verifying the train's location, the train controller acted on his assumption and authorised the person-in-charge to occupy a section of track that the passenger train was approaching.

Train controllers must not make assumptions about the locations of trains without first verifying their locations. Unless KiwiRail and train controllers remain alert to this risk and take all appropriate steps to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions, further incidents could occur, perhaps with more serious consequences.
