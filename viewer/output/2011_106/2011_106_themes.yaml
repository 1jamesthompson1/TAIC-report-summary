- name: Assumptions about the locations of trains
  explanation: The theme of assumptions about the locations of trains is highly relevant to this accident because the train controller authorized a track occupation without verifying the actual location of the passenger train. The controller made an "assumption based on what he was told by the person-in-charge of the worksite" and did not confirm the train's position, which is a violation of KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules (4.2.1, 4.2.2). This assumption led to the near-collision, highlighting the risk and the need for continual and proper management of such assumptions (4.2, 4.2.7).
- name: Visibility of trains on the rail network
  explanation: The visibility of trains on the rail network is a critical safety theme in this accident because the passenger train was not electronically visible to the train controller when he authorized the track occupation. A significant portion of the rail network is not electronically visible to train control, which requires train controllers to rely on other mechanisms to anticipate and verify train movements (4.3, 4.3.1). The lack of electronic visibility contributed to the train controller's error, as he did not register the absence of the passenger train on his mimic screen (4.3.3).
- name: Train controller wellbeing - nutrition and rest breaks
  explanation: Train controller wellbeing, specifically regarding nutrition and rest breaks, is a pertinent safety theme because the train controller had not eaten for about 15 hours before the incident, which could have contributed to mental fatigue and the subsequent error (4.4, 4.4.4). The Commission's report emphasizes the importance of train controllers eating properly and regularly during their shifts to maintain peak mental form, as well as the need for KiwiRail to ensure that train controllers treat diet and nutrition seriously (4.4.7, 4.4.8).
- name: Communication clarity and verification
  explanation: Clear communication and the need for verification is a significant safety theme because the incident was exacerbated by a miscommunication between the person-in-charge and the train controller. The person-in-charge's comment about a "subby" passing led the train controller to make incorrect assumptions about the train's location (4.2.5). Additionally, the train driver's practice of reducing the volume on his radio meant he missed an opportunity to intervene and prevent the conflict (4.5.2).
- name: Adherence to safety protocols and procedures
  explanation: Adherence to safety protocols and procedures is a central theme, as the train controller did not follow KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules that required verification of all train movements before granting track occupation authorizations (4.2.1). The incident underscores the importance of strict adherence to established safety protocols to prevent such near-misses and potential collisions (4.2.7, 4.2.9).
- name: Use of technology for train monitoring
  explanation: The use of technology for train monitoring is a relevant safety theme because the lack of real-time electronic visibility of train movements contributed to the incident. The Commission noted that if the train controller had access to global positioning technology, he would have been able to see that it was not safe to authorize the track occupation (4.3.6, 4.3.8). The development of systems like "GeVis" using global positioning technology is a step towards improving safety by providing train controllers with accurate locations of all trains (4.3.9).
