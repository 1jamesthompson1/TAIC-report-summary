They assumed the pre-test was low risk and did not require formal approval, and the network engineer proceeded with the firmware upgrade without hesitation, despite it being a critical component of the network (4.2.3, 4.2.8). This assumption and subsequent action directly led to the broadcast storm that caused the outage (4.2.10, 4.2.15).
","0.0","10.0","The technical co-ordinators on duty did not have sufficient technical knowledge of the network structure and operation to assess the impact risk of network maintenance tasks on ATC (4.3.36). This lack of training and competency contributed to the incident as they were unable to make informed decisions about the risks to service delivery of proposed maintenance on the digital data network (4.3.37).
","0.0","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to determine the role of training and familiarity with equipment in the incident.
","0.0","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to determine the role of Crew Resource Management in the incident.
","0.0","20.0","Airways' policy was not followed in the design process for the new digital data network, resulting in design documentation that was not controlled or approved and contained errors and omissions (5.4). Additionally, the network engineer did not seek formal approval for the firmware upgrade as required by the Letter of Agreement due to his previous experience and the perceived normalcy of the task (4.3.18). This lack of adherence to safety procedures and protocols was a significant factor in the incident.
","0.0","15.0","The organizational structure of Airways did not reflect the growing significance of the network engineering team, which was several levels removed from the General Manager System Operator, contributing to the team being under-resourced and its inadequate approach to risk management (4.3.41). This indicates a safety culture that did not adequately prioritize the importance of the network's role in ATC services.
","0.0","20.0","The risk management process used by Airways' network engineers for planned network maintenance did not take proper account of the context of the work or whether it was appropriate to be performed in the production environment, leading to unexpected service disruptions (5.5). The network had design vulnerabilities that had not been adequately considered or tested, which led to the outage being unexpected and having a greater effect on the ATC system than anticipated (5.6).
","0.0","10.0","The CAA did not have the appropriate capability to determine independently if the Airways ATN would perform as the rules required (4.4.1). CAR Part 171 was outdated and did not reflect the technology typically used by an ATN certificate holder in 2017, limiting the CAA's audit scope and allowing its internal technical knowledge and familiarity with Airways' systems to decline (5.9, 5.10).
","0.0","3.333","The engineers did not fully appreciate the complexity and interconnectivity of the network, which led to a lack of situational awareness regarding the potential for a broadcast storm and its cascading effects on the ATC services (4.2.14, 4.2.16).
","2.887","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to determine the role of emergency response preparedness in the incident.
","0.0","3.333","The maintenance work planning processes in the six months leading up to the outage were found to lack adequate risk management, with generic and non-specific information that was copied from one plan to another with minimal change (4.3.22). This indicates a deficiency in the maintenance and inspection regimes that contributed to the incident.
","2.887","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to determine the role of automation in the incident.
