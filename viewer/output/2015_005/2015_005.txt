The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting  process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and  the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry 
and an  independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiri es is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regula tory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On the afternoon of 23 June 2015, the domestic air traffic control services for New Zealand 
were suddenly and unexpectedly interrupted for about four minutes.  During this outage, air 
traffic sector controllers in the national air traffic management centre at Christchurch lost 
radar and radio contact with the aircraft under their control .   
1.2. Although the sector controllers had alternative radio frequenc ies and  standby radio s to 
contact aircraft, not al l of these systems work ed as expected.  
1.3. The telephone system was also disrupted by the outage , which prevented normal 
communication between the sector controllers and the airport control towers around New 
Zealand.   
1.4. The radar, radio and telephone services o f the national air traffic control system were 
integrated in a digital data network.  The interruption of services occurred when activities 
during an upgrade program to migrate remaining services on another part of the digital data 
network inadvertently ca used a 'broadcast storm '.  The storm prevented normal digital data 
traffic from reaching the control centre and thereby interrupted radar surveillance and 
communication systems.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (the Commission)  found  that the broadcast 
storm was initiated by a software code error in a device.  The broadcast storm subsided and 
the systems  returned to normal when the device was removed .  The national air traffic 
services were  brought back to full service in a controlled manne r over the next few hours.     
1.6. The Commission found  that Civil Aviation Rule s Part 171 , which  defines how an aeronautical 
telecommunications network is to be managed , was not contemporary f or the digital network 
technology used by Airways  Corporation of New Zealand Ltd (Airways) . 
1.7. The Commission identified the following safety  issues : 
 Airways ' digital data network did not have the resilience necessary to support 
an air traffic control service  
 the Civil Aviation Authority  of New Zealand  did not have the appropriate 
capability to determine  independently  if the Airways ' aeronautical 
telecommunications network would perform as the rules required . 
1.8. Airways engaged an external specialist organisation to critically review the architecture of its 
digital data net work and how it was  managed.  Airways  has since implemented many of the 
recommendations made by the external reviewer .  
1.9. The Commission made the following recommendation : 
 that the Secretary for Transport update and restructure C ivil Aviation Rules Part 171 . 
1.10.  The key lesson s arising from this inquiry are: 
 the incident was a reminder that effective risk management is a continuous process that 
applies to all aspects of an organisation's activities. From major projects to minor tasks, 
consideration must be given to the context of the activity within the organisation's purpose  
 it is important that well -defined processes that are critical to the efficient and safe 
operation of a system are followed.

 Final Report AO -2015 -005 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The Transport Accident Investigation Commi ssion (the Commission) became aware of the 
national outage of air traffic control  (ATC)  services through the news media on 23 June 2015 .  
After obtaining  more information about the circumstances from the Civil Aviation Authority  of 
New Zealand  (CAA) and Airways  Corporation of New Zealand Ltd (Airways) , the Commission 
open ed an inquiry on 24 June 2015 under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990.   
2.2. Three investigators visited the national air traffic management centr e (control centre) in 
Christchurch  on 26 June 201 5 to gather evidence and conduct interviews.  They returned the 
following  week to conduct further interviews with Airways ' operational staff.  
2.3. On 6 July 2015 , two investigators visited the Wellington ATC towe r to interview air traffic 
controllers (controllers) who had been  on duty at the time of the outage.  
2.4. The Commission contacted five airline operators and talked to 13 pilots to find out how the 
outage had affected their operations.  
2.5. The Commission engaged Liverton Technology Group  Limited  to provide specialist advice on 
digital network engineering.  
2.6. On 10 March 2016 , two investigators conducted follow -up interviews at the control centre . 
2.7. Two Commission investigators met with the CAA twice during March 2017 to present findings , 
consider potential safety recommendations  and discuss  action the CAA had taken since the 
outage . 
2.8. On 21 April 2017 , the investigator in charge  met with Airways to present the findings and 
potential safety recommendatio ns and to discuss action that Airways had taken since the 
outage . 
2.9. On 27 July 2017 , the Commission approved a draft final report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.   The Commission has considered the submissions received and any 
changes as a  result of those submissions have been included in this report.  
2.10.  On 27 September 2017, the Commission approved this final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
Introduction  
3.1.1.  On the afternoon of 23 June 2015, the domestic ATC services for New Zealand were  
interrupted suddenly and unexpectedly  for about four minutes .  During this  outage , controllers 
in the control centre  lost radar and radio contact with  the aircraft under their control , and 
communicat ions with airport control towers  around  New Zealand .   
3.1.2.  This interruption to services occurred when maintenance activities by a network engineer on 
another part of the digital data network at the control centre  inadvertently caused a broadcast 
storm .2 
The control centre  
3.1.3.  Nearly all  of New Zealand's domestic controlled airspace is managed from the  control centre  
located in Christchurch.  Workstations dedicated to each  of 10 control sector s allow 
controllers to see, communicate and manage the air traffic movements within their  control 
sector s, and to see aircraft in the adjacent sectors . 
3.1.4.  A separate control centre in Auckland manage s the oceanic controlled airspace  beyond the 
domestic airspace .  
3.1.5.  Surveillance information is displayed at the control centre  workstations on large screen s.  This 
information includes radar targets ,3 flight planning data  blocks, track vectors and navigational 
charts.  Each  controller ha s a multifunction desk phone system4 that allows them to 
communicate via radio or telephone . If this fails , they have a separate standby radio handset 
and a back -up cell phone.  
3.1.6.  Raw radar data5 from surveillance radar sites  around the country is received and processed in 
the control centre 's surveillance radar data -processing facility before being display ed as radar 
target s at the control  workstation s.  Process ing the raw  radar data adds information  that is 
relevant and specific to each sector controller.  This includes filtering out radar targets that are 
outside the control sector and adding a track, speed vector and data block  with flight planning 
information to each radar target .  The radar target symbol and its colour  are also changed to  
provide  further  information to the controller.  
3.1.7.  The infrastructure support ing this air navigation  service i ncludes a network of communication,  
navigation and surveillance facilities around the country, a central data -processing system and 
the user interface  software system that enables  the controllers to achieve  a safe, efficient and 
orderly movement of air traffic .   
3.1.8.  All parts of this air navigation system  (the system)  are connected through a number of  digital 
data network s. 
The outage  
3.1.9.  At 1441 on Tuesday 23 June 2015, most contr ollers in the control centre  experience d a 
progressive loss of radar target  (aircraft) position al accuracy  on their display screens. Within a 
very short period the radar targets turned from green to orange to indicate that  only 
                                                        
2 A broadcast storm is an extreme amount of broadcast traffic that consumes sufficient network resources so as to 
render the network unable to transport normal traffic.  
3 A radar target is processed raw radar data after it has been correlated with an aircra ft's transponder code and the most 
accurate track, current position and height have been selected from multiple radar sources.  This is the normal radar 
target displayed at a controller's workstation.  
4 The m ultifu nction desk phone system is a voice over i nternet protocol (VoIP) phone system. It operates through a voice 
switch that uses the digital data network to make trunk calls.  
5 Raw radar data is raw radar target and track data directly from a selected radar head in the field that has not been 
processe d with other information.  

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -005 interpolated positions and tracks were  being displayed .  An inter polated position  is an 
automatically  plotted back -up position  of an aircraft based on its filed flight plan .  Interpolated 
radar targets are displayed whenever a  radar target position has not been updated with raw 
radar data within  a pre -set time period .   
3.1.10.  The one exception was the Southern S ector covering the Dunedin -Invercargill -Queenstown 
area. Target information in this sector continued to be displayed normally.  
3.1.11.  Controllers primarily monitor aircraft compliance with the approved (cleared) flight plans , so 
they do not need to talk to the pilots often .  However, gradually some controllers became 
aware  that they could not communicat e by radio with aircraft in their sector s.  When  this 
happened , they initially switched to their alternat ive radio frequen cies, which  did not work for 
all control lers who tried them.   
3.1.12.  The duty manager in the control centre  instructed all controllers to stop all aircraft taking off  
and to land all aircraft in the controlled airspace in accordance with  their existing flight plan s.  
He also instructed controllers to increase the minimum vertical and horizontal separation 
between airborne aircraft.  
3.1.13.  While controllers were attempting to re -establish  radio and telephone communications  to put 
these instructions  into effect , the radar targets and voice communications started to come 
back online.  The system outage , including a period of degraded service , lasted four minutes 
before full functionality  was restored .  
3.1.14.  The control centre  management did not know  what had caused th e outage or if it was likely to 
reoccur.  While the engineering staff investigated the cause, the control centre  management 
decided to remain vigilant for signs of  a further outage.  No new flight  plans were accepted 
until the Airways Executive Crisis M anagement Group was satisfied that the network  was 
stable and would remain operational.  Normal  ATC services were resumed in stages from 
1630.  
The impact upon aircraft  
3.1.15.  The weather across the country was generally fine.  
3.1.16.  There were 42 aircraft flying under  ATC within New Zealand's airspace at the time of the 
outage.  Three aircraft were  delay ed in landing due to the ir being required to hold en route 
before they could enter the next sector.  
3.1.17.  The outage caused 49 scheduled departures to be  delayed and 19 flig hts to be cancelled.  
The i mpact upon airport control towers  
3.1.18.  The controllers at the four international airports  retained communications with aircraft and 
continue d operating with only a minor reduction with the performance of their flight planning 
systems.  They could not contact the sector controllers in Christchurch by phone , but the back -
up cell phone system w as operational.  
3.1.19.  The 13 control towers at regional airports retained communications with local aircraft , but lost 
their surveillance and flight planning systems. They also lost telephone communication with 
the sector controllers , but could use the back -up cell phone s.  They had another system that 
enabled  local aircraft movements to be controlled visually with signal ligh ts if required .  
3.1.20.  The Oceanic Control Service (OCS)  in Auckland , which manages air traffic outside the domestic 
air space, had a partial loss of services but continue d to operate  with back -up systems .  One 
connection to the  aeronautical fixed telecommunications network  failed , but the other 
 
Final Report AO -2015 -005 
<< Page 5 >>
 remained in operation .  The surveillance display  changed automatically to bypass  mode6 and 
continued  to operate . 
Airways ' response  
3.1.21.  The control centre  management formed two response groups at 1445 : one focused  on fixing 
the problem ; and the other on its response to the public and Airways ' customers.  The 
Executive Crisis M anagement Group first met at 1515 and took charge of  the public response.   
3.1.22.  A senior controller was allocated the role of operations crisis manager .  He set up a 
teleconference with local air traffic managers, technical co -ordinators and other selected 
managers from around the country .  He also  co-ordinated the immediate technical response to 
find out what had happened , so that th e system could  be returned to a fully operational 
status .  
3.1.23.  Within three days of the outage  Airways had technical representatives  from its overseas 
equipment suppliers on -site and working with its own engineers  to identify the cause of  the 
outage.  It had simulated the network structure in a laboratory and had confirm ed its 
suspected cause by replicating the outage .   
3.2. Background  
New Zealand 's air navigation services  
3.2.1.  The Minist er of Transport makes rules under the Civil Aviation Act 1990 that define the 
requ ired air navigation and management services .  The CAA is the issuing authority for an 
operator certificate to provide air navigation services.  At the time of the outage  Airways was 
the only certificated provider of these services in New Zealand.  The CAA  checks Airways' 
compliance with its  operating certificate  and the requirements of the Civil Aviation Rules 
(CAR) .  The current rules separate air navigation services into two parts : air traffic 
management under CAR Part 172; and the aeronautical telecommunications network (ATN) 
under CAR  Part 171.     
3.2.2.  New Zealand's domestic airspace is controlled by Airways at its control centre  in Christchurch.  
In an emergency , control can be handed over  to the Main Contingency control centre  in 
Auckland.   
3.2.3.  Airways also provides aerodrome control services at the four international airports and at 13 
regional  airports around the country. Tower  controllers manage aircraft within the airports ' 
control zone s, includ ing aircraft manoeuvring o n the ground  and those taking off  and landing . 
3.2.4.  A separate OCS control centre is located in Auckland to manage the large area of oceanic air 
space for which  New Zealand is responsible.  The OCS can also be managed from a dedicated 
workstation in the control  centre  in Christchurch.  
Aeronautical telecommunications network   
3.2.5.  The ATN includes  all of New Zealand's air navigation  services and the communication links to 
the control centre .  The ATC part of the ATN includes navigational aids, radio transmitters, 
radio receivers , radar heads , airport facilities , back -up control centres and control towers  (see 
Figure 1).  Airways provides the physical infrastructure at each  Airways site .  The 
communication links between sites  are generally duplicated and are Airways system s, or 
provided by one or both of the external telecommunication companies (telco s) with which 
Airways has agreements . 
3.2.6.  The ATN is mana ged by duty technical co -ordinator(s) located at a workstation next to the duty 
manager  of the control centre . The  technical co -ordinators are responsible for monitoring the 
ATN and related Airways ' technical systems to ensure that they are operating corre ctly. The 
                                                        
6 Bypass mode is a display mode for controllers' workstations. It uses raw radar data directly from a local radar 
surveillance unit rather than radar targets from the control centre.

3.2.7.  Since the mid-1990s , digital systems have been used to provide the telecommunications 
infrastructure  for the ATN .  This section is a brief description of how a digital data network 
works.    
3.2.8.  All information to be transmitted across a digital data network has to be converted to an 
appropriate digital format , after which  it is treated much like a letter in a postal system . Input 
signals  (such as speech for radio or telephone , radar data  and control switch selection s) are 
digitised , then transported through the network in data  packets8 to their  intended 
destination s.  Each packet includes the address details for its source and each destination.  At 
the destination , the data packets  are assembled i n the correct order and may be converted 
back to their original (input) format or used as they are.   
3.2.9.  If the amount of  information to be transmitted is greater than the capacity of one packet , 
multiple packet s are grouped and linked to match the amount of information. The 
communication is often two -way, so a link between the two communicating devices  (called a 
session ) is established first.  Once the session is established, the packet s can flow between 
the two devices until the transfer is complete and the session ended . For example , a session 
would be established for the duration of a telephone call or a radio conversation.  
                                                        
7 WAN = wide area network; HF = high frequency;  ADC = Airways Development Centre (an Airways building); LAN - local 
area network; AHB =Andy Herd Building ; and OCS = Oceanic Control Service . 
8 A packet is a collection of digital data transmitted as a unit. It consists of a payload (the information) encl osed within a 
wrapper.

 3.2.10.  Once a packet  enters the network it c an take a range of paths to its destination. Network 
equipment (such as a router ) read s the addres s details within the packet  and direct s it to the 
next connected device until the  packet  reach es its destination.  
3.2.11.  If a route is blocked due to equipment failure, or the data transmission speed through a 
device is constrained for some reason , the router ma y send the packet  by an alternative route.  
Some route information is configurable by the user and a router  may also run specific 
programs to add selected network operational features to that device.  These options and 
features are brought into play by the  network operator 's choice of  configuration settings for 
each device.  
3.2.12.  Firewalls are placed within  the network to monitor all packet s that pass through  that section .  
The firewall s check specific details within packet s at the start of each session and appl y a set 
of security rules to determine if the packet s can pass or will be rejected.   
IPMux project  
3.2.13.  About 18 months before this outage, one of the t elcos advised Airways that it was planning to 
upgrade the network  it provided to them  for communication link s.  Once the upgrade was 
completed, Airways ' equipment would no longer be compatible and the telco's current network 
would be dismantled.  Airways was given a deadline to upgrade its own network equipment if it 
wanted to continue  using  the telco's (upgraded) network cloud . 
3.2.14.  Airways started the internet protocol multiplexor ( IPMux ) project in response .  The project 
included the  supply, test and install ation  of all the necessary equipment.  Most of the new 
network equipment had been installed and servi ces migrated across by June 2015.  The 
system outage occurred while engineers were preparing to migrat e one of the remaining 
services .

4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  This incident could have presented a significant  risk to the safety of air transport  if the 
network  had not recovered after a few minutes.  Fortunately the outage occurred in  daytime , 
while  the weather across the country was good  and before the evening peak traffic period .  
These factors  minimise d the potential consequences .  
4.1.2.  The outage exposed a vulnerability in the digital data network , which  Airways had previously 
believed  was reliable and resilient to disturbances.  The vulnerability was the existence of a 
single point of failure  that could disable all New Zealand 's domestic ATC services , including  
back -up radio communication  systems , and adversely affect ATC services in this country's 
oceanic control area .    
4.1.3.  The controllers  had trained for scenarios in which  they lost radio communications or 
surveillance systems , but not both simultaneously.  Airways had  considered that concurrent 
failures were  unlikely .  The duty manager and controllers adapted standard procedures with 
which  they were familiar and managed the outage safely and effectively .  Airways promptly 
identified  the reasons for th e outage and made  changes to its organisation , the network 
architecture  and its operational procedures to prevent a reoccurrence.  
4.1.4.  Two safety issues were identified during this inquiry : 
 Airways ' digital data network  did not have the resilience necessary to support 
an ATC service  
 the CAA lacked the capability to determine  independently  if the Airways ATN 
would perform as the rules required . 
4.1.5.  The following analysis explains what happened , discusses  these safety issues and 
recommends  actions to prevent a reoccurrence.  
4.2. What happened  
Informal  work on the network  
4.2.1.  A formal work plan had been set up to transfer one of the few existing services to the new 
network .  This service comprised  the air -ground radio communication links between the back -
up OCS workstation located in the Christchurch control centre  and the high-frequency radio 
control system located at Seagrove, Auckland.  
4.2.2.  The project engineers decided that it would be more efficient  to conduct a pre -test to ensure 
that the Christchurch workstation could communicate through the new network to the radio 
control system in Auckland  before the migration work was started .  This would be a simple 
computer -to-computer communication link test  through the network and not require any 
physical changes (see Figure 2).  The engineers did not intend to operate the high-frequency  
radios.   
4.2.3.  The engineers considered  the pre -test to be  a minor task that did not require the approval of a 
formal plan.  They considered it to be low risk because it was for a service related to a fourth  
level of back -up to the OCS.  The main operations for OCS were based in Auckland and this 
work would not affect them .  The engineers therefore considered that they needed  just the 
approval of the tech nical  co-ordinator  on the day to proceed  with the pre -test, and th is was 
obtained .

Where the broadcast storm started9 
4.2.4.  The network test traffic between the two computers would be transported on the same virtual 
local area network ( VLAN )10 that carried all services that were essential for the operation of 
the control centre , but this commonality was not considered at the time to be a risk for the 
pre-test.   
4.2.5.  The pre -test was conducted on 16 June 2015 , with a radio engineer operating the 
Christchurch OCS contingency workstation  adjacent to the control centre .  The radio engineer 
was unable to get the t wo computer devices to communicate , so another pre -test was 
scheduled for  23 June 2015 with a network engineer present to assist .  
Further informal work led to outage  
4.2.6.  On 23 June 2015 , the two engineers received approval from the technical co-ordinator to 
conduct the second pre -test.  After it failed again , the network engineer connected his laptop 
to the network management system and confirmed that the remote and local computer 
network interface cards were  connected and configured correctly  (see Figure 2).  He found 
that the operating software (firmware11) in the local network interface card  between the OCS 
contingency workstation and the digital network was the factory default version and had to be  
upgraded.    
4.2.7.  At the time i t was normal procedure for Airways ' network engineers to upgrade firmware in 
network equipment remotely and while the equipment  was in  an operational mode.  The 
facilities to enable remote network management were standard provisions in the network 
management software and network equipment.  The network team manager  explained that 
remote network maintenance was preferable to sending members of his team to distant sites 
when he had limited  resources.

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -005 4.2.8.  The network  engineer proceeded with th e firmware  upgrade  without hesitation. He remotely 
downloaded the new firmware to the network interface card , then rebooted it to commence 
the installation process .  After a delay that he considered was too long, the network interface 
card had not come back online , so he went to the equipment room  to remove the card  from 
the mounting rack  (see Figure 3).   
4.2.9.  In doing so h e walked through the ATC room  and past the technical co-ordinators to the 
equipment room .  He partially extracted the network interface card  to disconnect it from the 
power  supply , then left it in the mounting rack  while he went to get an antistatic bag to take 
the card  back to the workshop.  He was diverted from that task to assist with a major problem 
that had developed in the control centre .  This was the outage.  
4.2.10.  The outage had started when the engineer rebooted the network interface card , and the 
disruption began to subside  when he disconnected the card from the power supply .  He had 
no idea at the time that his actions had  both  initiated and stopped the outage.  The reboot had 
created a 'broadcast storm' within the network , and specifically within the VLAN that carried 
all services to the ATC workstations . The storm  had prevented legitimate data packets  
transported within the VLAN from reach ing their intended destination s. 
What is a b roadcast storm ? 
4.2.11.  An example of a  'broadcast message ' is the message packet initiated by a digital network 
switch to find out  what devices it is connected to .  In this case the switch broadcast s an 
'address request'  message  to all connected devices to request the ir address details , then 
uses the responses to update its switching table .  The switch read s the destination address 
details of all incoming data packet s, checks its switching table  and forwards the d ata packets 
to their correct destinations .

<< Page 11 >>
 4.2.12.  A broadcast storm can be created under certain conditions if a network switch gets a confused 
response about which devices are connected to its ports, which can then corrupt the switching 
table .  For example , if two ports on a switch are unintentionally looped together through 
external cables or connections , the switch will send broadcast messages to both ports and 
they will be received  by the same switch  through the port at the other end of the loop. Each 
incoming broadcast message from the loop is re -broadcast to all other ports. This sequence 
keeps repeating and will rapidly  generate a storm of 'address request ' messages  unless some 
action is taken  to quell them .   
4.2.13.  The network switching equipment must still manage the address request messages , but the 
volume of such messages in a storm can overload a switch.  An overload prevents the switch  
passing genuine packets to the appropriate port s and on to their respective destinations.  
Once genuine packets are hindered, dropped or blocked from passing through the network, 
user services are affected.   
4.2.14.  Broadcast storms are a known phenomenon within data networks.  Commercial  network 
equipment usually has standard configuration settings and software protocols ,12 such as 'loop 
detection' , 'storm control' and 'Spanning Tree Protocol' , to detect the conditions that could 
initiate a broadcast storm and prevent one building.  
What started  the broadcast storm ? 
4.2.15.  The firmware  in the network interface card  had a dormant code  error  that had escaped the 
manufacturer's quality assurance tests .  It was found later to have an effect only when the 
firmware was upgraded from the factory default version to the version current at the time  of 
the pre -test. Airways ' engineers were not aware that the code error  existed either , because 
they had not made this particular firmware version upgrade .  The network interface card  was 
connected to the switch by  two separate ports to provide redundancy if one path failed.  When 
the engineer  rebooted the network interface card  to install the upgraded firmware , the code  
error  took effect.  It unintentionally bridged the two ports on the network interface card , which 
formed a loop in the  switch and thereby created the conditions  for a broadcast storm . 
4.2.16.  The switch (called the IPMux switch) to which  this interface card was connected had the 
capability to protect itself against loops and broadcast storms , but this had been disabled in 
the configuration settings for other reasons (see paragraph 4.3.19 ). Consequently , a 
broadcast storm built rapidly and escalated out of control.   
How did the broadcast storm cause the outage?  
4.2.17.  Airways ' networ k was arranged so that  all operational telephones, radio , surveillance  and 
runway information  services  were connected to one common VLAN across the country  (called 
the IPMux VLAN).  Other VLANs were also used for related ATC services .  
4.2.18.  The storm was initiated and contained within the IPMux VLAN , but moved through the 
adjacent , upstream  network switch to the firewall s.  Both switches were very  high-performance 
types and had ample  processing capacity to handle the broadcast messages and the ir normal 
packet traffic , but the firewall s were affected .  The firewall s were not able to process  both the 
storm of broadcast messages and apply the security rules to the normal data traffic .  The 
firewalls  dropped connections  from the normal data traffic  in order to respond to the 
broadcast messages .   
4.2.19.  The dropped data traffic was the radio and telephone conversations that controllers were 
conducting and the incoming raw radar data for the ATC data -processing system.   
4.2.20.  The controllers'  digital desk phone system for radio and telephone conversations used the 
digital data network to make external connections  to control towers and radio equipment 
around the country .  As the broadcast storm built, n ew telephone calls  and radio 
communications to and from the control centre  could not be connected  to Airways ' network .   
                                                        
12 A protocol is a set of rules that governs some activity.  

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -005 4.2.21.  The controllers ' alternative radio frequencies were accessed through the same digital desk 
phone system and were dependent on the network , so they became  unusable.  Some of the 
standby radio systems were connec ted to the digital telephone exchange and some were hard -
wired to an adjacent building.  All those connected to the digital telephone exchange were 
disabled by the blockage at the firewalls.  
4.2.22.  At the same time , the processed surveillance and flight planning information displayed at 
controllers ' workstations started to degrade as raw data from sources outside the control 
centre  was blocked  from updating the ATC data -processing system .   
4.2.23.  The surveillance data from the southern area of the South Island was not a ffected by  the 
broadcast storm and was displayed as normal .  This data traffic travelled through the same 
physical firewall s, but the data  packet s were logically13 associated with  another VLAN 
(independent of the IPMux VLAN ), so were  isolated from the broadcast storm.    
Effect on airport control towers  
4.2.24.  All airport  towers receive d their processed radar  targets and flight planning information from 
the data -processing centre  at Christchurch , so they suffered the same degradation of 
proce ssed data as the controllers  in the control centre .  
4.2.25.  International control towers had  a local radar data -processing capability that was 
synchronised with the Christchurch  system .  However, they  also had links to alternative raw 
radar data directly from  their local surveillance radar heads , so they were able to continue to 
operate  with reduced capability in  bypass mode.   The telephone and radio worked normally for 
local calls and airport radio frequencies.  
4.2.26.  Regional towers did not have local data -processing  capabilit ies, so those controllers lost all 
processed data  from their workstation displays.  The telephone s and radio s worked normally 
for local calls and local radio equipment , but radio s that were  physically remote and 
connected through the network would not have worked.  
4.2.27.  All airport tower controllers were unable to contact the sector controllers in Christchurch using 
Airways ' phone system, but could by cell phone.  
Findings  
1. The loss of ATC services occurred when a broadcast storm in the Airways digital 
data network blocked normal communications and raw radar data traffic to and 
from the control centre.  
2. A dormant programming code error in the firmware of a network interface card 
created a bridge between its two ports during a firmware reboot.  Both ports 
were connected to a network switch at the time, which created a loop and 
initiated the broadcast storm.  
3. The IPMux network switch had the capability to detect and prevent broadcast 
storms escalating, but Airways had temporarily disabled these mitigation 
protocols when it configured the switch due to an unexpected side effect. 
Airways had not made alternative arrangements to protect against broadcast 
storm events.  
 
 
 
 
                                                        
13 This means that the digital code in the data packets separated them from packets in other VLANs.

 4.3. Airways ' network resilience  
Safety issue  - Airways' digital data network  did not have the resilience necessary to support  an 
ATC  service.  
4.3.1.  Resilience is the ability of a system to recover quickly and provide at least a basic service if 
some part of it fail s or is disabled.   In terms of the ATN, resilience is the product of good 
design  with built -in redundancy , sound maintenance processes , and testing to ensure  that the 
overall system remains  resilient.  This section explains why Airways ' ATN lacked sufficient 
resilience for  its intended purpose.  
Compliance documentation  
4.3.2.  The Airways Engineering and Maintenance Group's exposition define d how the group w ould 
meet its obligations under  CAR Part 171.  The exposition  linked to the Engineering and 
Maintenance  Group's Information F ramework for details of the policy and process es.   
4.3.3.  The standard Airways design and development process start ed with a concept design , then 
progresse d through p reliminary design to the detailed design phase .  Each phase require d an 
approval process to start , and a check and approval process to end.  The design certificates 
for the preliminary and detailed design phases define d the infor mation required for each 
phase and provide d a record of the completed design.  The completed design package had to  
be in a final, approved state and certified to that effect on the design certificate before 
installation could commence.  
4.3.4.  The new portion of the digital data network contained within the IPMux project was designed 
and built by the network team from  the Airways Engineering and M aintenance Group .   
4.3.5.  A contract of service between the Engineering and Maintenance Group and the Service 
Delivery Group  was defined in an Airways document called the Letter of Agreement.  The letter 
include d the process for seeking approval to carry out any work on the network and the 
equipment  that was regarded as critical to service delivery.   
Network design  control  
4.3.6.  When t he Airways IPMux Project Charter was authorised on 1 July 2013, the next step  was the 
detailed design phase .  The detailed design certificate (DDC) should have been up to date and 
approved before installation work started , but the most recent version  (obtained five months 
after the outage ) was dated 5 August 2014.   It was an old draft version  with obvious 
differences  from the system that was installed .   
4.3.7.  The list of design standards in the DDC omitted  some standards that were considered critical , 
and listed  others that were  critical  but had not been complied with in the design. For exam ple, 
ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization )14 Annex 10, Vol ume 3 describe d the basic 
requirements for an ATN to transport communications and digital data, but was not listed . 
European Organisation for Civil Aviation Electronics  (EUROCAE )15 standards ED-136 and ED -
138, which  described the operational and technical requirements for ATNs that transport ed 
digitised voice communications ,16 were  listed  but not met .    
4.3.8.  The minimum standard required  by EUROCAE  ED-138 is for  data and voice services to be 
separated logically or physically to maintain their independence .17  The requirement for 
separation was specified  in Airways' DDC , but was not implemented in the  IPMux network .  An 
acceptable option would have been to transport voice and surv eillance data  on different 
VLANs . Airways had used VLANs to separate  other ATC  services in previous network iterations  
and carried the same grouping over to  this new design for the IPMux project . Had the

 Final Report AO -2015 -005 surveillance  and voice  services  been logically separated into separate VLANs , the outage may 
have been limited to just communications or surveillance , rather than both.  
4.3.9.  The DDC had not been updated to reflect the equipment change s made during the design 
process. The design team had decided to change th e network switches to a type from a 
different manufacturer .  The new equipment had different broadcast storm mitigation 
protocols  that were found to have an unexpected side effect , so these  protocols had been  
temporarily disabled. This unrecorded design ch ange therefore had a significant consequence  
during the  events leading  to the outage.  
4.3.10.  The DDC proposed that device configuration settings be recorded in the different network  
management tools specific to each manufacturer's products , and in a design docum ent for 
each major component of the new network.  Configuration settings for network switches and 
routers are critical parts of a design that define how the network will operate.  It was not clear 
how, or whether,  these settings were designed and approved.      
Network drawings  
4.3.11.  The standard for drawings and documentation required by a DDC for a completed design was 
defined in the Airways exposition. The exposition required design documents to be traceable 
and approved with  a level of detail 'sufficient to allow the installation engineer to meet the 
customer requirements '.  It went  on to state  that, 'The watermark shall state "Approved for 
Detailed Design Purposes, or Installation Purposes as applicable "'. Appendix A in the DDC was 
supposed to be a register of design documentation , but was blank.   
4.3.12.  The network design  drawings  obtained immediately after the outage had not been  approved , 
nor did they show their revision status.  The drawings  focused on detail ed aspects of the 
digital data network  without  the high-level system information  that would  have  provide d an 
end-to-end view of how each  service would use the digital data network.  Several drawings 
were generic and had been copied to use for other equipment , but the unique connection  
details did not match . Several drawings with the same number were obviously different and 
others did not match the equipment t hat had been  installed.   
4.3.13.  The drawing set was incomplete and sh ould not have been used to install  the new network  in 
the control centre .  However,  the physical installation was complete and had been in 
operational  service for some time  when the outage occurred . 
Design review    
4.3.14.  A normal step during a design process is for an independent designer to review the design 
documents against the design objectives and check key points to ensure that the design  can 
be built and th at th e documentation is complete .18  A design review team was nominated in 
the DDC , but a review did not take place.    
4.3.15.  After the outage Airways arranged for an independe nt technical review of its entire ATN and 
the new network design .  The extensive report made many observations  and listed 26 
recommendations in the subject areas of network design and configuration, network 
operations, network security and general processe s and management.  Key recommendations 
were to strengthen the governance, form an operations support centre and increase staff 
resources of the network team to match its importance to Airways ' service delivery.  This 
included establishing a new network man agement position that was closer to the General 
Manager System Operator.    
                                                        
18 A typical design process that was in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard would include these processes and 
checks.

 Risk management  by the network team  
4.3.16.  The Airways network team  had a risk management process  for maintenance on the network ,19 
but it was not used in every instance  and nor was it effective .  This section  discusses the 
adequacy of the risk management processes for network maintenance activities.  
4.3.17.  The network engineering team considered it  normal practice to update firmware  on network 
equipment while the equipment was in s ervice  and without taking any special precautions .  
This activity should not have been permitted in a data centre where the  risk of something 
going wrong c ould have safety implications.   It was also contrary to the expectations of the 
contract for service between the Engineering and Maintenance Group and the ATC Service 
Delivery  Group . 
4.3.18.  The Letter of Agreement list ed 'network equipment ' in the highest  level of criticality for 
Airways ' ability to manage aircraft safety.  Under the terms of the agreement ,20 the network 
engineer should have sought formal approval to upgrade the firmware on the network 
interface card .  However , as he had already commissioned about 100 of these network 
interface card s and upgraded their firmware  at various times during the IPMux  project  without 
a problem , and he was about to undertake what the network team considered a 'normal 
practice ' of upgrading equipment while it was in service,  he did not seek formal approval . 
4.3.19.  When the new IPMux network switches were first installed and con figured, the engineers had 
discovered a conflict between  the broadcast storm mitigation software within the switch es and 
another network service.  The project manager's decision for dealing with this conflict and 
higher priority work was to  temporarily disable the broadcast storm protocols in the IPMux 
switches until it could be resolved at a later date.  The ramification was that  all IPMux switch es 
installed from that date would have been unable to suppress a broadcast storm.   
4.3.20.  If the disabling of the  broadcast storm mitigation  had been logged as a system risk , and the 
engineer had considered that risk when he was thinking about upgrading the network 
interface card 's operating software, the outcome may have been different.  Similarly, if the 
practice of u pgrading equipment within an operational environment without taking any 
additional precautions had included some basic risk management steps, the broadcast storm 
would not have been created.  
4.3.21.  Any of the following actions would have minimised or eliminated the risk of a broadcast storm.  
The engineer could have removed the network interface card  and upgraded it in the test lab  
then reinstalled it.  Alternatively , he could have removed one of the network connections from 
the card and upgraded it in situ , or he could have  replaced the card with a pre -tested unit.  If 
he had sought approval from the Service Delivery Group, the decision may have been to 
postpone the pre-test to a time with minimal impact s on air traffic.  
Risk management during historical network  maintenance  
4.3.22.  Samples of t he maintenance work planning process es in the six months leading up to  the 
outage21 were  reviewed and found to lack adequate risk management.  These contain ed 
generic and non -specific information that was copied from one plan to ano ther with minim al 
change.  The sampled plans did not have drawings  associated with them .  The plans did not 
consider  the possibility of a problem  or include 'back -out' actions if the work could not be 
completed in the approved timeframe.  
4.3.23.  In the six months  before the outage in  2015  and for up to 12 months after wards , Airways 
notified the CAA of  several  network incidents.  This period coincided with the commissioning 
and migration  of services to the new network.  These incidents were reviewed  as part of this  
inquiry in order to understand the work that was being performed and to identify any common

 Final Report AO -2015 -005 themes.  Eleven  of the incidents that had some similarities to the outage were examined  
further in conjunction with Airways.   
4.3.24.  Two themes were appa rent.  First , the incidents had surprise d the engineers involved because 
they had initially assessed the work as being non -intrusive to operations.  Secondly, the 
network configuration  did not seem to have had the diversity and self -repairing ability that 
engineers said it was designed to have.  The incidents had been  disruptive , but digital services 
had not always  transferred  automatically to a secondary path  when the primary path failed .  
Both themes point ed to inadequate consideration s of risk management during  the design of 
the network and for the maintenance . 
4.3.25.  The examples of unexpected problems caused during maintenance  indicate that the network 
team's risk management processes were not mature .  The Commission previously 
investigated two incidents involving Airways ' systems in 1997 and 2000 that had similar 
themes to the more recent events (see Appendix 1).  International data on such events was 
not readily available , which could have indicate d either  that such incidents were  not normally 
reported to , or investigated  by, aviation authorities  or that they were  rare.  Either way , the 
lessons have not been made available to the public.  
Risk management for the IPMux project  
4.3.26.  The design and installation of the new network was managed by a dedicated project manager , 
but at least two major project risks  could only be resolved with corporate input  - equipment 
delivery delays and a lack of project staff resources .  Both risks had been identified in the 
IPMux Project Charter when the project received corporate approval  and both materialised  
with detrimental impact s on the project 's delivery.    
4.3.27.  The telco had set a fixed deadline for Airways to upgrade its network equipment in order to 
maintain connectivity , and th at drove the project timeline.  When an international supplier 
delay ed its equipment delivery , Airways ' response was to reduce the planned equipment test 
program to meet  the external deadline .  During the installation phase the small team of 
engineers was working long hours and away from home for extended periods.  The lac k of 
team resources became a significant risk to  the success of the project , and for Airways in 
terms of the health and safety  of the network installation team . 
4.3.28.  A test lab oratory  had been  proposed , where engineers could create a replica network and test 
new equipment interfaces, new software and configuration changes before placing them into 
a production environment.  Funding for this laboratory was not approved  by Airways ' senior 
management until after the outage.   
ATN vulnerabilities exposed by th e outage  
4.3.29.  The outage presented a real situation to test the resilience of the ATN.  It exposed a major 
weakness in that  all air traffic services delivered from the control centre  were subject to a 
single point of network failure  along with other design vulnerabilities .   
4.3.30.  Airways had taken steps in its design of the ATN to avoid single points of failure . These 
included : equipment duplication and physical separation between items of equipment ; diverse 
cable routes; back -up and uninterruptable power supplies; and telco independence .  In spite 
of these efforts the network itself remained  common to all services.   
4.3.31.  The standby radio s were  connected to the same digital telephone exchange as the main and 
alternat ive radio frequencies , and the primary telephones .  When the broadcast storm 
occurred, the digital telephone exchange was unable to make connections through the 
network to locations outside the building , so the standby radio s did not have the intended 
independence.  
4.3.32.  Transporting voice communications for teleph one and radio on the same logical VLAN as radar 
data meant that they shared a common potential point of failure.   This was contrary to the 
best advice provided in EUROCAE 's minimum specification , ED-138.  
 
Final Report AO -2015 -005 
<< Page 17 >>
 4.3.33.  The earlier postponement of efforts to  resolv e the q uestion of  why the broadcast storm 
mitigation protocols of the IPMux switches did not work  with other network services , and the 
decision to disable this feature  temporarily  left the network vulnerable to further loss of 
services .   
4.3.34.  An analysis of the configuration tables of the two switches directly involved in the outage 
revealed an other deficiency  that could have made the  network  less resilient.  Some VLAN 
services passing in parallel between  the two switches to the two firewalls would  not have had  
an alternative route if the primary route had failed .  In that event  information would have been 
lost.   
4.3.35.  The two firewalls were also effectively placed in the centre of the internal network , rather than 
at the periphery . That  was an inappropr iate location  for the network architecture , because it  
would  likely have required the firewalls to make routing decisions for the data packets , as well 
as perform their  prime function of making  security decisions about through -traffic.  This extra 
processing load for an already complex operating characteristic turned  the firewalls  into a 
single point of failure when they were faced with the broadcast storm  from inside  the network.  
Training  
4.3.36.  The Engineering and Maintenance Group p rocedures required work requests  to be reviewed 
and approved by technical co-ordinators.  The technical co-ordinators on duty at the time of 
this outage , in common with other technical co-ordinators, did not have sufficient technical 
knowledge of the netwo rk structure and operation to assess  properly  the impact risk  of 
network maintenance  tasks on ATC.  
4.3.37.  The technical co-ordinators were familiar with aeronautical navigation systems , but less so 
with digital data networks.  In general they had not been trained on the digital data network , 
so they lacked the knowledge and skill s to make informed decisions about the risk s to ATC 
services  of proposed network maintenance.  There was a  lack of system drawings and 
explanatory documentation to show the technica l co-ordinators how the ATC system used the 
network , so they had to rely on the advice of the network engineers.   
4.3.38.  Airways realised this weakness after the outage and implemented network familiarisation 
training for the technical co-ordinators and others who had an interest.  Formal training 
modules have been put in place  and now there is more contact and information  sharing 
between the technical co-ordinators and the network engineers.   
4.3.39.  Airways also realised that network engineers lacked the skills to evaluate  risk at a corporate  
level.  Formal training in risk management has been conducted with the network engineering 
team.  
The network team management  
4.3.40.  The network engineering team had been  formed relatively recently, whereas the ATN (in 
various arrangements ) had been managed by Airways for a long time and had establish ed a 
track record of reliability . 
4.3.41.  The network engineering team's importance and responsibility had grown significantly as the 
ATN had become more dependent on digital d ata networking to connect Airways ' 
infrastructure.   Airways ' organisational structure had not been altered to reflect  the growing 
significance, which meant the team's  management was several levels removed  from the 
General Manager  System Operator .  This dis tance was likely as not a factor in the team being 
under -resourced for the IPMux project, and its inadequate approach to risk management.  
4.3.42.  Airways has made changes to improve the management and functioning of the network team 
to improve its  performance  (see section 6) .

 Final Report AO -2015 -005 Findings  
4. Airways ' policy was not followed in the design process for the new digital data 
network.  This resulted in design documentation that was not controlled or 
approved , and contained errors and omissions that made the documentat ion 
unfit for purpose.  
5. The risk management process generally used by Airways ' network engineers for 
planned network maintenance did not take proper account of the context of the 
work , or whether it was appropriate to be performed in the production 
environm ent, and therefore created some unexpected service disruptions to air 
navigation services.  
6. The digital data network in the control centre  had design vulnerabilities that had 
not been adequately considered or tested. This led to the outage being 
unexpected and having a greater effect on the ATC system than anticipated.   
7. Airways had not trained the technical co-ordinators adequately to allow them to 
make informed decisions about the risk s to service delivery of proposed 
maintenance on the digital data networ k.    
8. The team responsible for the design, procurement, installation and 
commissioning of the new network did not have sufficient authority to manage 
significant project risks properly.  
 
4.4. The CAA overview  of the Airways network  
Safety issue - The CAA  did not have the appropriate capability to determine  independently  if the 
Airways ATN  would perform as the rules required . 
4.4.1.  The CAA audited the provision of ATN services against CAR Part 171.  The rule s listed specific 
air navigation  services such as non-directional beacon s, distance measuring equipment and 
radio navigation aids.  Further system and t echnical specifications were expected to comply  
with ICAO Annex 10, Volume s 1, 3 and 4 , where appropriate . The rule define d the 
requirements in  terms of t he services required, documentation, manuals, operation, 
maintenance, management and quality assurance. Service provider s such as Airways  
describe d in their exposition s how these requirements would be met . 
4.4.2.  ICAO Annex 10 contain ed standards and recommended practices , but  left options up to the 
respective states ' civil aviation authorit ies. CAR Part 171 did not specify  the options from ICAO 
Annex  10 that were appropriate for New Zealand.  
4.4.3.  CAR Part 171  was written in 1992 and had not been updated since to accommodate  changes 
in the technology  typically used by  an ATN certificate holder in 2017.  For example, the non -
directional beacons listed were  planned to be decommissioned in the near future and data 
networks were  not mentioned .  The digital data network s are  an essential component of 
Airways' business, linking the ATN and ATC services, both of which incorporate increasingly 
advanced subsystems .  
4.4.4.  Although Part 171  was outdated , Airways had adopted new technology to modernise the AT C 
system, and had revised its exposition to reflect the changes.   As Airways was the sole 
provider of both ATC and the ATN , it was able to define  its technical requirements for the ATN 
in the Letter of A greement between the two internal groups of Airways .  The Letter of 
Agreement was o utside the CAA's audit scope . 
4.4.5.  This arrangement led the CAA to stand  back from auditing the wider network systems and 
processes that were  not in  CAR Part 171 and to concentrate  on the traditional equipment and 
systems covered by the rule  and ICAO Annex 10.   However , by adopting this position  the CAA 
allowed its internal technical knowledge and familiarity with Airways ' systems to decline.  
 
Final Report AO -2015 -005 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.4.6.  From the mid -1990s , digital data networks bec ame more prevalent in the primary systems 
that underpin ned Airways ' ATN, but they were  not listed in the Airways  exposition.  The CAA did 
not enquire into the design or  maintenance of the digital data network systems or the ATC 
software systems , but did consider their overall performance as part of the complete ATN .  At 
the time of the outage  the CAA did not have the expertise necessary to conduct an effective  
audit  of the technology  or processes that Airways used to support the digital data netw ork. The 
CAA Part 171 auditor in 2015 had no experience with digital data networks  and retired shortly 
after  the outage, leaving the position vacant.   
4.4.7.  At the time of the outage the digital data network was not listed in the exposition as one of the 
facilities that Airways provide d, so it would not have been a focus for CAA audits either.  
4.4.8.  The future of New Zealand's controlled airspace has been set out in  a plan called the New 
Southern Sk y, which is led by the CAA in association with Airways and the Ministry of 
Transport.  This is part of an international ICAO plan to update the global  air navigation 
systems.  A crucial part of this new plan is the digital data network that will support all the 
various aspects of the air navigation service .   
4.4.9.  As the performance of the New Southern Sky will have a high dependency on digital data 
networks, the CAA will need to maintain an  active role to ensure that network performance 
and resilience are maintained at acceptable level s for the global system . This will include 
having the in-house technical capability and familiarity with all  technology and software 
systems that Airways uses to provide the air navi gation system , so that the CAA can  
understand how they work, how  they are  used  and what performance to expect , and ensure 
that any potential vulnerabilities  are managed.   
 
  Findings  
9. CAR Part 171 , which  defines the requirements for an  aeronautical 
telecommunications  certificat e holder, is not contemporary for regulating a 
modern  aeronautical telecommunications  system  that uses  technology  such as 
digital data networks . 
10. CAR Part 171 limited the  CAA to an  audit scope that reflected the technology 
environment of aeronautical telecommunications that were in place  in 1992  
when the Rule Part was developed .  
11. The digital data network was a major part of the air navigation system provided 
by Airways , but the CAA did not have the capability in-house to audit or review 
the network 's performance and management.   

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -005 5. Findings  
5.1 The loss of ATC services occurred when a broadcast storm in Airways ' digital data network 
blocked normal communications and raw radar data traffic to and from the control centre . 
5.2 A dormant programming  code error in the firmware of a network interface card created a 
bridge between its two ports during a firmware  reboot.  Both ports were connected to a 
network switch at the time, which created a loop and initiated the broadcast storm.  
5.3 The IPMux network switch had the capability to detect and prevent broadcast storms 
escalating, but Airways had temporarily disabled  these mitigation protocols when it configured 
the switch due to an unexpected side effect. Airways had not made alternative arrangements 
to protect against broadcast storm events.  
5.4 Airways ' policy was not followed in the design process for the new digital data network.  This 
resulted in design documentation that was not controlled or approved, and contained errors 
and omissions that made the documentation unfit for purpose.  
5.5 The risk management process generally used by Airways ' network engineers for planned  
network maintenance did not take proper account of the context of the work , or whether it was 
appropriate to be performed in the production environment , and therefore created some 
unexpected service disruptions to air navigation services.  
5.6 The digital data  network in the control centre  had design vulnerabilities that had not been 
adequately considered or tested. This led to the outage being unexpected and having a 
greater effect on the ATC system than anticipated.   
5.7 Airways had not trained the technical co-ordinators adequately to allow them to make 
informed decisions about the risk s to service delivery of proposed maintenance on the digital 
data network.    
5.8 The team responsible for the design, procurement, installation and commissioning of the new 
network d id not have sufficient authority to manage significant project risks  properly . 
5.9 CAR Part 171, which defines the requirements for an ATN certificate holder, is not 
contemporary for regulating a modern aeronautical telecommunications  system  that uses  
technolo gy such as  digital data networks . 
5.10 CAR Part 171 limited the  CAA to an  audit scope that reflected the technology environment of 
aeronautical telecommunications that were in place  in 1992  when the Rule Part was 
developed .  
5.11 The digital data network was a major part of the air navigation system provided by Airways, but 
the CAA did not have the capability in -house to audit or review the network 's performance and 
management.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the  regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Airways resolved the problems it had with running broadcast storm protocols in its new 
network equipment and rolled  out this change  to the whole network.  
6.3. The network maintenance procedures were reviewed and significantly revised to manage risk s 
to service delivery from network maintenance  works. This change included a strengthened 
process for Airways'  Network Engineering Notice form and a risk assessment process through 
a Change Advisory Board.  
6.4. Airways restructured the Engineering and Maintenance Group to create a new senior 
leadership tea m manager responsible for the enterprise architecture and networks.  This 
appointment more aptly reflects the contribution that digital data networks make to the 
provision of Airways ' air navigation services.  
6.5. Airways developed training modules for the dig ital data network and ensured that the 
technical  co-ordinators gained the required knowledge to manage the system  safely . 
6.6. The network engineering drawing standards and approval process were  brought into line with  
the standard Airways expected from the rest  of the organisation.  
6.7. Airways engaged an external specialist organisation to critically  review  the architecture of its 
digital data network and how it managed it .  Airways has already implemented many of the 
recommendations that this organisation made .  
6.8. The CAA recognised the need to maintain organisational capabilities to allow it to appropriately 
identify and monitor risk that may be present within the aviation system as a result of ongoing 
and often rapid technological advances.  It has addressed this risk by ongoing learning and 
development training for regulatory staff, revision of position descriptions and recruitment or 
secondment of new staff.  The CAA engaged a replacement auditor for CAR Part 171 who is 
more familiar  with digital data networks  and in 2016, and updated the position description for 
the auditor role to include experience in air navigation and air traffic management technology.     
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.9. Airways recognised that the network engineers lacked an ap preciation of risk management 
from an organisational perspective.  A training module has been  developed to focus network 
engineers on how their work could affect the organisation's ability to meet its service delivery 
obligations.  This training has been r olled out across the team.  
6.10.  Airways recognised that the network team was under -resourced to meet its organisational 
needs.  New staff have been  engaged and the team split into four groups to focus on network 
design, network support, security and the right a rchitecture to support the future enterprise 
needs.

 Final Report AO -2015 -005 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to the Secretary for Transport and 
the CAA.  In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.2. The current CAR Part 171 has become  outdated owing to  the natural growth and development 
of technology and software used to provide a modern air navigation service.  In its current 
form the rule inhibits the CAA from ensuring  that th e air navigation service  meets New 
Zealand's expectations and obligations to the ICAO.  
On 28 September 2017 , the Commission recommended that the Secretary for Transport 
update and restructure CAR Part 171 to include the wider scope of technology, software 
and navigation aids that are normal for a modern air navigation service  and to make 
provision for the rule to cater for future changes in technology .  (028/17)  
7.2.1.  On 20 October 2017  the Secretary for Transport replied:  
The Ministry recognises there have been considerable technology developments 
since the introduction of the CAR Part 171 in 1992.  In light of this, I agree there is a 
need to review the rule.  
I am advised that the Civil Aviation Authroity (CAA) shares this position and are 
progressing with the r ule consideration process.  The Ministry will work closely with 
the CAA to progress the rule changes, and will keep the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission (the Commission) informed of the progress of any changes 
to the rule, and any other work tha t relates to the Commission's recommendation.

 8. Key lessons  
8.1. The incident was a reminder that effective risk management is a continuous process that 
applies to all aspects of an organisation's activities. From major projects to minor tasks, 
consideration m ust be given to the context of the activity within the organisation's purpose.  
8.2. It is important that well -defined processes that are critical to the efficient and safe operation 
of a system are followed.

 Appendix 1 : Other similar incidents  
1. Commission  investigations  
1.1. In 1997 , the Commission investigated a communications outage in the Wellington 
terminal area sector operated from the Christchurch air traffic management  centre 
(TAIC, 1997) . The terminal area sector lost main, alternat ive and standby radio 
frequencies for six minutes.  It took another s even minutes to restore radio 
communications to the affected aircraft.  
1.2. The outage occurred when an engineer upgraded the operating software in a network 
multiplexor22 while it was in service and being used for air traffic management.  When 
the multiplexor w as rebooted to complete the upgrade, all digital services connected 
through it were disrupted rather than being rerouted through an alternative path.   
1.3. The Commission found that if the technician had not disconnected the multiplexor, the 
outage would have spread to other network equipment.  This suggest ed, but was not 
stated, that it was caused by a broadcast storm.  
1.4. In 2000 , the Commission  investigated another outage in the Christchurch air traffic 
management  centre when all sector workstations lost radio a nd telephone services for 
five minutes (TAIC, 2000) . 
1.5. The outage occurred when technicians were modifying the battery back -up to a voice 
switch ,23 but accidently tripped the power supply to it.   
1.6. The investigation found that the d rawings used by the technicians did not match the 
installed system and it led to their accidentally activating a trip relay.  
2. United States  telecommunications infrastructure outage, 19 November 2009  
2.1. As the Federal Aviation Administration 's flight data -proce ssing telecommunications 
network was being migrated from a copper to a fibre backbone, a new router installed 
as part of the migration works failed.  The failure required air traffic controllers to revert 
to manual flight data -processing procedures for fiv e hours, causing delays for more than  
800 flights.  
2.2. The cause was identified as a router configuration error.  When the new router started 
up, it expected a copper link between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City to be a high -
capacity fibre  optic link , so it directed all national data traffic through it.  The equipment 
was not able to handle that capacity , so data either was corrupted or did not get to the 
destination.  The router had sent alarm messages to the network monitoring system but 
that was swi tched off at the time.  Additionally, all monitored alarms from the router's 
site location had been unintentionally suppressed when the intention was to suppress 
spurious alarms from a single faulty device at the site.  
3. National air traffic system in U nited Kingdom , 12 December 2014  
3.1. The national air traffic system's flight data processing was arranged with a central 
computer and remote terminals. The software had been set up to connect a maximum 
of 150 terminals , so when an extra one was connected without k nowledge of this limit, 
the system shut down.  
3.2. Air traffic controllers had to revert to manual procedures for all traffic in and out of 
London for six hours before the automatic flight data processing was re -established.
                                                        
22 A multiplexor is a network device that connects multiple inputs to a single data stream output.  
23 A voice switch provides a similar function to a business as a private telephone exchange.
