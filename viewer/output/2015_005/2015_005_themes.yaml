- name: Lack of Resilience in Digital Data Network
  explanation: The lack of resilience in Airways' digital data network was a critical safety theme in this incident. Resilience refers to the ability of a system to recover quickly and provide at least a basic service if some part of it fails or is disabled. The report identified that "airways' digital data network did not have the resilience necessary to support an atc service" (4.2). This was evident as the network's design vulnerabilities had not been adequately considered or tested, leading to an unexpected outage with a greater effect on the ATC system than anticipated (5.6). The network's single point of failure was exposed when a broadcast storm occurred, blocking normal communications and raw radar data traffic to and from the control center (5.1).
- name: Inadequate Risk Management Processes
  explanation: Inadequate risk management processes were a significant safety theme in this incident. The risk management process used by Airways' network engineers for planned network maintenance did not take proper account of the context of the work or whether it was appropriate to be performed in the production environment, leading to unexpected service disruptions (5.5). The engineers considered the pre-test to be low risk and proceeded without formal approval, exposing the network to a broadcast storm (4.2.3). Additionally, the network team's risk management processes were not mature, as indicated by unexpected problems during maintenance and the lack of automatic transfer to secondary paths when primary paths failed (4.3.25).
- name: Inadequate Design and Documentation Control
  explanation: Inadequate design and documentation control was a safety theme that contributed to the incident. The design process for the new digital data network did not follow Airways' policy, resulting in uncontrolled, unapproved documentation with errors and omissions, rendering it unfit for purpose (5.4). The detailed design certificate was outdated and did not reflect the system installed, with critical standards omitted or not complied with (4.3.6, 4.3.7). The network design drawings were also not approved or up to date, lacking high-level system information and end-to-end views (4.3.12).
- name: Insufficient Training and Technical Knowledge
  explanation: Insufficient training and technical knowledge among personnel was a safety theme that played a role in the incident. Airways had not trained the technical coordinators adequately to make informed decisions about the risks to service delivery of proposed maintenance on the digital data network (5.7). The technical coordinators lacked sufficient technical knowledge of the network structure and operation to assess the impact risk of network maintenance tasks on ATC (4.3.36). This lack of knowledge and skills contributed to the inability to prevent or mitigate the incident.
- name: Organizational and Management Deficiencies
  explanation: Organizational and management deficiencies were a safety theme that underpinned the incident. The team responsible for the design, procurement, installation, and commissioning of the new network did not have sufficient authority to manage significant project risks properly (5.8). The network engineering team's importance had grown, but Airways' organizational structure had not been altered to reflect this, resulting in the team being under-resourced and its approach to risk management being inadequate (4.3.41).
- name: Regulatory Oversight Limitations
  explanation: Regulatory oversight limitations were a safety theme that emerged from the incident. CAR Part 171, which defines the requirements for an ATN certificate holder, was not contemporary for regulating a modern aeronautical telecommunications system that uses technology such as digital data networks (5.9). The CAA's audit scope was limited to technology from 1992, and the CAA did not have the capability in-house to audit or review the network's performance and management (5.10, 5.11). This lack of regulatory update and expertise meant that the CAA could not effectively oversee the digital data network's design and operation.
