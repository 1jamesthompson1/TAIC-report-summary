- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The skipper of the Easy Rider did not hold the qualification required to be in charge of the vessel on the accident voyage, which indicates a lack of understanding of ship stability principles. This lack of knowledge led to the vessel being overloaded and poorly loaded, with too much weight too high up on deck, which was the prime factor leading to its capsize (5.15, 5.16).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The skipper's lack of formal training on the fundamentals of vessel stability, which would have been covered in the inshore launch master's certificate that he did not possess, contributed to the improper loading of the vessel. This directly affected the vessel's stability and was a significant factor in the accident (4.6.30, 4.6.31).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The Easy Rider did not have sufficient life-saving equipment for the nine persons on board, and the life-raft was not able to float free to the surface because it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as the vessel was sinking. This non-adherence to safety procedures reduced the chances of survival for those not wearing lifejackets (5.5, 5.10).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The owner of the Easy Rider did not understand the principles of safe ship management, and the skipper did not show a willingness to comply with the rules. This indicates a poor safety culture within the organization, which failed to prioritize the safe operation of the vessel as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules (5.13, 5.14).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The vessel was operating as a commercial fishing vessel without the skipper having the necessary maritime qualification, and passengers were carried on board contrary to regulations. This lack of compliance with maritime regulations contributed to the unsafe conditions that led to the accident (5.11, 5.12).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The skipper's decision to embark on the voyage despite the forecasted and actual adverse weather conditions demonstrated a failure in risk management. The vessel's marginal stability was not suitable for the conditions, and the decision to proceed increased the risk of capsizing (5.3, 5.4).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The actual sea conditions on the night of the accident were not suitable for a vessel the size of the Easy Rider with marginal reserve stability. The skipper's decision to continue with the planned departure despite the weather conditions contributed to the vessel's vulnerability to capsizing (5.3, 5.4).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The lack of sufficient life-saving equipment and the failure of the life-raft to float free to the surface affected the emergency response capability. This lack of preparedness reduced the chances of survival for the individuals involved in the accident (5.5, 5.10).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There was no evidence found in the document that maintenance and inspection regimes directly contributed to the accident.

- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There was no evidence found in the document that the use of automation or over-reliance on automated systems directly contributed to the accident.

  explanation: 'There was no evidence found in the document that a communication breakdown directly contributed to the accident.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The "Other" category is included to account for any additional factors not covered by the predefined safety themes. In this case, the "Other" category includes the historical lack of common and good-standard practice for keeping ship operation and safety records, which resulted in the loss of important information about the Easy Rider that could have been relevant to the vessel's stability and safety (5.16).
