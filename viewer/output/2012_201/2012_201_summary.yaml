- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The Easy Rider was not in compliance with maritime regulations, as it was operating as a commercial fishing vessel without the skipper holding the required qualification (4.6.15). The owner and skipper did not meet their safe ship management obligations, which included ensuring the vessel was operated safely and that all personnel had appropriate qualifications (4.6.25). The vessel was also overloaded, which is a direct violation of safety management practices (5.2).
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The skipper lacked the necessary knowledge of ship stability, which is a fundamental requirement for any commercial operator (4.6.30). This lack of understanding was a prime factor leading to the vessel's capsize (5.16).
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The Easy Rider had low stability reserve when it departed, and the extra load of cargo and passengers raised the center of gravity, making the vessel "tender" and at serious risk of capsize (4.3.7, 4.3.8).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The skipper's decision to embark on the voyage despite the forecasted weather conditions demonstrated a lack of situational awareness (4.4.2). Additionally, the vessel's direction of travel into the wind, waves, and swell would not have been rolling as much if the waves had been coming from the side, indicating a lack of understanding of the environmental conditions (4.3.12).
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The weather conditions were not suitable for the Easy Rider to venture across Foveaux Strait at night with marginal stability and passengers on board (5.3). The forecasted and actual sea conditions were not appropriate for a vessel the size of the Easy Rider with marginal reserve stability (4.4.10).
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Although there was no evidence that maintenance deficiencies directly contributed to the accident, the vessel had undergone various modifications over the years, and the stability information had been superseded, which could have affected its stability characteristics (4.6.3).
- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There is no direct mention of fatigue or alertness as contributing factors in the document. However, the decision-making process of the skipper could have been influenced by fatigue, given the late departure and the night voyage (4.4.2).
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The document does not explicitly mention communication issues among the crew as a contributing factor. However, the skipper's failure to communicate his intentions and the vessel's status effectively to the Maritime New Zealand inspector could be considered a communication issue (4.6.37).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The skipper's decision to sail despite the weather forecast and the vessel's loading condition indicates a failure in risk assessment and management (4.4.2, 4.6.30).
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The vessel did not have sufficient life-saving equipment for the number of persons on board, and the life-raft was not able to float free to the surface, indicating a lack of emergency response planning (5.5, 5.10).
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fire detection or suppression issues contributing to the accident.

    '
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of the skipper or crew being distracted by non-essential activities leading to the accident.

    '
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that structural integrity or material fatigue were factors in the accident.

    '
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'While human error in the form of poor decision-making by the skipper was a factor, it is encompassed within other themes such as regulatory compliance, training, and situational awareness.

    '
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide information on the safety culture or organizational influences within the company that owned the Easy Rider.
