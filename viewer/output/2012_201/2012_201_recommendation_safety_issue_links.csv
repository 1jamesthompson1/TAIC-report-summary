2012_201,020/12,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand trace the whereabouts of the remaining Owenga class fishing vessels and ensure that the appropriate stability calculations have been made for each vessel and alert the owners to any special stability characteristics they should be considering in the daily operation of their vessels.,"At about 2000 on 14 March 2012, the fishing vessel Easy Rider departed Bluff for Great South Cape Island off the west coast of Stewart Island.  The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Great South Island, where they were to prepare for the upcoming mutton-bird harvest.  The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.  The vessel was constructed of steel and was about 11 metres overall length with a beam of about 3.55 metres.  It was powered by a single diesel engine.  There was thought to have been 9 of its class built.  Four (including the Easy Rider) have been lost at sea over the years for differing reasons including one that was overwhelmed by a large wave, and 5 are thought to be still in use.  One of these 5 is currently being used for commercial fishing out of Bluff.

The Commission is in the process of firstly modelling the Easy Riderâ€™s 'light ship' stability from data obtained for other vessels of the Owenga class, and secondly estimating its actual stability on the accident voyage.

The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made preliminary calculations that support this view.

Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessels were built and with successive changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.

","The Easy Rider capsized when it was engulfed by what was probably a large breaking wave, which reduced the vessel's stability by landing sea water onto the fishing deck, at the same time as rolling the vessel past the angle where it lost any chance of recovery.

The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Great South Island, where they were to prepare for the upcoming mutton-bird harvest.  The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.

The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.  The vessel was constructed of steel and was about 11 metres overall length with a beam of about 3.55 metres.  It was powered by a single diesel engine.  There was thought to have been 9 of its class built.  Four (including the Easy Rider) have been lost at sea over the years for differing reasons including one that was overwhelmed by a large wave, and 5 are thought to be still in use.  One of these 5 is currently being used for commercial fishing out of Bluff.

The Commission is in the process of firstly modelling the Easy Riderâ€™s 'light ship' stability from data obtained for other vessels of the Owenga class, and secondly estimating its actual stability on the accident voyage.

The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made preliminary calculations that support this view.

Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessels were built and with successive changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.

","The skipper's intention was for the Easy Rider to operate as a commercial fishing vessel on the accident voyage, as he fully intended to go fishing commercially once his passengers and their equipment had been offloaded.
