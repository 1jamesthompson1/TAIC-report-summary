  \ The Easy Rider  was trans porting extended family to an island where they were\
  \ to prepare for \nthe upcoming muttonbird  harvest.  The accident happened 6 years\
  \ after the Kotuku  tragedy, \nin which 6 members of an extended family had also\
  \ lost their lives in Foveaux Strait while \nreturni ng, by fishing vessel , from\
  \ islands after completing  the muttonbird  harvest.  The \ncircumstances of the\
  \ 2 tragedies were different.  Nevertheless, in each case a fishing vessel \nnot\
  \ normally used for transport ing passengers and their equipment was involved, and\
  \ in each \ncase standards  of the day and  the Maritime Rules  were not met.  During\
  \ the course of this \ninvestigation the Commission talked to the owners , and inspected\
  \ the operation , of 4 vessels \nthat were being prepared to transport passengers\
  \ and their effects to Titi Islands.  Those \ninspections showed that many of the\
  \ lessons from the Kotuku  tragedy had been heeded , at \nleast  by those operators\
  \ , and that , as a rule , other boats involved in transporting people to the \n\
  Island s for the muttonbird harvest appeared to be fit for purpose  and were  being\
  \ operated in \ncompliance with Maritime Rules .   \n4.1.2.  For the 2013 muttonbird\
  \  season approximately 5 commercial operators said that they would \nbe operating\
  \ vessels to the Titi Islands.   These 5 vessels were correctly certified and had\
  \ been \nsurveyed as suitable for that purpose by Maritime New Zealand.  Maritime\
  \ New Zealand \nestimated that p rior to the start  of the muttonbird  season up\
  \ to 12 vessels of other classes \nmight  also intend  operating at times to the\
  \ Titi Islands .  This was an estimate only because the \nsituation change d from\
  \ one year to the next.  Other means for accessing the Titi Islands were \navailable,\
  \ such as using helicopters.  Maritime New Zealand though t that some of t hese\
  \ \nvessels might  be commercial fishing vessels being used to transport family\
  \ members , similar \nto the Easy  Rider  situation.   Maritime New Zealand had\
  \ consulted the muttonbird  associations \nand made it known that skippers  and\
  \ anybody intending to travel on   these other vessels \ncould  request a free \"\
  safety check\" from Maritime New Zealand before departure from Bluff.  \n4.1.3.\
  \  Every vessel has limits to what it can withstand.  If the crew does not know\
  \ these  limits  then  \nthe risk of exceeding them could be high .  If th ey were\
  \ to push the margins or knowingly \nexceed them , the risk of  there being an accident\
  \  would increase .  It follows then that no vessel \nis immune from capsize regardless\
  \ of how structurally sound it is, how well it has been \nmaintained, and how inherently\
  \  stable it is.  An overloaded vessel with poor stability might \nsurvive a trip\
  \ in good weather and a properly loaded vessel might survive a trip in severe \n\
  weather, but a poorly loaded vessel with poor stability in severe weather will be\
  \ at serious risk \nof capsize .   \n4.1.4.  The Easy Rider  had been operated by\
  \ several owners during its 42 -year history , sometimes as \na pleasure boat, but\
  \ primarily as a commercial fishing boat.  It had no doubt operated in worse \n\
  sea conditions than those it ex perienc ed on the night it sank, but the weather\
  \ conditions were \nnot good.  The boat was heavily loaded on the accident trip,\
  \ and it had marginal stability when \nit departed from Bluff.    \n4.1.5.  This\
  \ following section analyses what happened to the Easy Rider  to cause it to capsize.\
  \  It also \ndiscusses how it came to be in that location in those weather conditions\
  \ under the command \nof a skipper who did not hold the necessary qualification\
  \  to be in command.    \n4.1.6.  The analysis also examines the regulatory system\
  \ of which the Easy Rider  was part of over the \nyears and the opportunities the\
  \ system had for reducing the risk of the accident.    \n4.1.7.  When an accident\
  \ like this occurs, the consequences of it are largely dependent on: someone \n\
  being alerted to the accident; the emer gency response to the accident; the preparedness\
  \ of \nthe vessel and crew to deal with the emergency; and the equipment that is\
  \ available to \npreserve life while help is on its way.  These issues are discussed\
  \ also.    \n4.1.8.  Of the 4 bodies recovered , one passenger was found to have\
  \ a level of alcohol in his blood \nand one crew member was found to have a high\
  \ level of THC, the active ingredient of \ncannabis.  The report discusses the effect\
  \ s of alcohol and cannabis on the ability of people to \nsurvive in cold water.\
  \   \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  Although\
  \ the Easy Rider  was 42 years old, it had undergone extensive restoration under\
  \ the \nguidance of a surveyor, then successfully entered into the safe ship management\
  \ system.  \nThere were a number of deficiencies that the inspector noted in  his\
  \ preliminary inspection of \nthe Easy Rider  earlier on the day that it departed\
  \ Bluff, but no evidence was found that any of \nthese deficiencies directly contributed\
  \ to the accident.  The description of events given by the \nsole surviving crew\
  \ member was u seful in discounting a number of other factors that could \ncontribute\
  \ to a boat capsizing.   \n4.2.2.  There did not appear to be any malfunction with\
  \ the boat or its equipment, although this could \nnot be entirely ruled out because\
  \ the sole survivor was not in the wh eelhouse at the time, but \nwas instead out\
  \ on deck.  The description he gave was of the boat being overwhelmed by a \nwave,\
  \ or waves.  This possibility is now explored further.   \n  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n\

  \ and balance)  \n4.3.1.  The stability of the Easy Rider  was calculated from the\
  \ data available.  The Commission did \nnot have the \"as-built\" lines plan of\
  \ the vessel, but it obtained sufficient data to build a \nstability model of the\
  \ vessel that was accurate enough to determine  that the Easy Rider  had \nlow stability\
  \ reserve when it departed Bluff.  Appendix 4 shows the detail of this stability\
  \ \nassessment and any limitations with its accuracy.    \n4.3.2.  Figure 4 shows\
  \  3 stability curves (GZ curves) using the model created for the Easy Rider : one\
  \ \nshows a typical departure condition; one shows a typical mid -voyage (50% load)\
  \ condition ; and \nthe other shows the departure condition from Bluff for the accident\
  \ voyage.  A sample stability \ncurve is shown for comparative purposes.   \n4.3.3.\
  \  This fourth  curve shows the min imum current -day standards set by the I nternational\
  \ Maritime \nOrgani zation  for fishing vessels.  At the time the Easy Rider  was\
  \ designed and built , these \nrequirements had not been written, and due to its\
  \ size the Easy Rider  was not and would still \nnot be re quired to comply with\
  \ these requirements.   \n4.3.4.  The d ynamic stability is the stability characteristic\
  \ of a vessel when moving (particularly rolling) \nand is the energy necessary to\
  \ incline the vessel to a certain angle of heel.  The dynamic \nstability may be\
  \ det ermined by measuring the area under the righting lever curve (GZ curve) \n\
  up to a certain angle of heel. The larger the area, the better the dynamic stability.\
  \  The area \nunder the curve is shown in blue in Figure 4.  Put another way, the\
  \ larger the blue area  under \nthe curve, the harder it is to capsize the vessel.\
  \  Appendix 3 gives a more detailed explanation \nof stability.  \n4.3.5.  The Easy\
  \ Rider  with a 50 % load is a typical condition while fishing : partially loaded\
  \ with fuel, \nwater, ice, bait, cod pots and fish.  The  blue area under this curve\
  \ is greater  than it is when the \nvessel departs on a fishing trip.  The deck\
  \ edge immerses at 10 degrees of heel but the vessel \nmaintains positive stability\
  \ until the angle of heel reaches 50 degrees.    \n4.3.6.  The second load case\
  \ shows the Easy Rider  typically loaded ready for departure on a fishing \nvoyage.\
  \ The vessel is full of fuel, bait, ice and stores and equipment on deck.  The blue\
  \ area \nunder the curve is flatter and smaller.  The vessel is less stable and\
  \ more at risk of capsize.  \nThe deck edge immerses at 8 degrees of heel but the\
  \ vessel only maintains positive stability \nuntil the angle of heel reaches 37\
  \ degrees .   \n4.3.7.  The third load condition shows the Easy Rider  as it was\
  \ loaded ready for departure on the \naccident voyage.  The extr a load of cargo\
  \ on deck and the passengers themselves raised the \ncentre of gravity of the vessel\
  \ and consequently the blue area under the curve is very flat and \nvery small.\
  \  In this condition the deck edge immersed at 4 degrees and the vessel only \n\
  maintain ed positive stability until the angle of heel reached 21 degrees .   \n\
  4.3.8.  The vessel in this condition is said to be \"tender\", meaning  that it\
  \ would take only a small \nforce or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel\
  \ to take on an angle.  Evidence of this was  \nobserved by onlookers when loading\
  \ the cargo at the wharf.  Placing one \"lift\" of wood on the \nside of the deck\
  \ caused the vessel to list  noticeably .  The wood was repositioned across the\
  \ \nvessel to balance the load.  Such a list caused by a relatively smal l part\
  \ of the load was an \nindication to someone who understood the concept of vessel\
  \ stability that there was a \nproblem with the stability of the vessel.  \n4.3.9.\
  \  It is important for vessel operators to know that the stability of a vessel is\
  \ determined by not \njust how much weight is placed on board, but how it is distributed\
  \ around the vessel.   \nGenerally speaking, weights loaded higher up (above the\
  \ centre of gravity) will adversely affect \nstability, while the more weight that\
  \ can be loaded down low (below the centr e of gravity) will \nimprove the stability.\
  \   On smaller vessels, people can represent a large percentage of the load , \n\
  and when they are standing in a wheelhouse or on deck this can be above the vessel's\
  \ cent re \nof gravity.  \n \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Report 12 -201 4.3.10.  The fishing\
  \ deck was tightly packed with fishing equipment and cargo.  If water had landed\
  \ on \nthe deck in significant quantit ies, it would not have had clear passage\
  \ to the freeing ports.  In \nthe initial moment after landing on the deck the water\
  \ would have been  the equivalent of \nloading more weight on the vessel, and unlike\
  \ the lashed cargo that weight would have been  \nrelatively free to move around.\
  \  The Commission calculated that it would have taken about 2.5 \ntonnes of sea\
  \  water to fill the fishing deck to the h eight of the bulwarks.  It would have\
  \ taken \nas little as 0.5 tonnes of sea  water on the deck to reduce the Easy Rider\
  \ 's GM to zero.  Water \non the fishing deck would have:  \n\uF0B7 caused the vessel\
  \ to sink lower in the water (reduced its freeboard)  \n\uF0B7 caused a direct rise\
  \ in the centre of gravity of the vessel and consequently eroded the \nalready \
  \ small stability in reserve (the blue area under the curve)  \n\uF0B7 caused an\
  \ additional \"virtual rise\" in the vessel's centre of gravity due to the free\
  \ \nsurface effect , because the ent rapped water was free (albeit restricted by\
  \ the deck \ncargo) to move across the vessel and exacerbate any roll angle caused\
  \ by wave action.  \n4.3.11.  There is a margin of error with the stability calculations\
  \ for the Easy Rider  (refer to Appendix \n4).  Even so, the calculations show that\
  \ the Easy Rider  was in a precarious condition from the \ntime it left the shelter\
  \ of Bluff Harbour.  The question then arises, how did it survive the first 4 \n\
  hours of the voyage without capsizing? .  The answer probably lies in the complexity\
  \ of forces \nthat act on a small vessel as it rolls and pitches in relatively large\
  \ waves.    \n4.3.12.  The Easy Rider 's direction of travel once reaching open\
  \ waters was into the wind, waves and \nswell, so it would not have be en rolling\
  \ as much as if the waves had been  coming from the \nside.  Another consideration\
  \ is the amount of water on the deck.  As mentioned above, \nshipping water on a\
  \ deck will erode a vessel's stability reserves , but it might not be enough to\
  \ \ncause it to capsize unless it coincided with the vessel taking a sizable roll.\
  \    \n4.3.13.  It could not be established with any certainty how far off the \
  \ Bishop and Clerks Islands the \nskipper intended to pass.  The general area where\
  \ t he Easy Rider  was thought to have \ncapsized was one of known turbulent waters\
  \ , more so the closer a boat got to the Islands .  The \narea  was also close to\
  \ where the skipper would start to adjust the course to head down the \nwest coast\
  \ of Stewart Island.  Guidi ng a vessel through a confused sea at night and when\
  \ the \nvisibility is reduced by rain is difficult.  Waves approaching from different\
  \ direction s will \npossibly not be visible to the skipper until it is too late\
  \ to react, particularly with a slow -speed \ndisplacement vessel that will take\
  \ some time to turn.   \n4.3.14.  The surviving deckhand said  that the Easy Rider\
  \  was engulfed by a wave from the side, \ncausing it to heel over.  The waves had\
  \ generally been taken on the bow while the Easy Rider  \nheaded westwards  toward\
  \ t he Bishop and Clerks Islands.  A wave coming from the side could \nhave been\
  \  due to the confused sea in the area or it could have result ed from the Easy\
  \ Rider  \nchanging cour se (whether planned or not).  No -one really knows for\
  \ sure.  The surviving \ndeckhand's account of what happened is understandable \
  \ given what we now know about the \nstability.  He first heard a large wave, which\
  \ for him to single it out from the ambient noise \nwould indicate possibly a breaking\
  \ wave large r than the average  waves .   \n4.3.15.  He noted that when the wave\
  \ hit , \"the deck filled with water and I was washed to the port side \nof the\
  \ vessel  - the vessel then heeled sharply to port\".    \n4.3.16.  The deck becoming\
  \ immersed in water would have eroded the vessel's already -small reserves \nof\
  \ stability . The wav e heeled it over past the angle of  vanishing  stability -\
  \ and it capsized .   \nFinding s  \nThe Easy Rider  capsized when it was engulfed\
  \ by what was probably a large breaking \nwave, which reduced the vessel's stability\
  \ by landing sea  water onto the fishing deck, at \nthe same time as rolling the\
  \ vessel past the angle where it lost any chance of recovery . \n \nReport 12 -201\
  \ \n<< Page 23 >>\n  \nThe Easy Rider  was loaded with too much weight, too high\
  \ up on deck, which left the \nboat with insufficient reserve stability for its\
  \ intended voyage when it depart ed from \nBluff.  \n4.4. Voyage planning and climatic\
  \ conditions  \n4.4.1.  The actual weather conditions in Foveaux Strait during the\
  \ night of 14/15 March were similar \nto those that had been forecast (see Appendix\
  \ 1).  MetService  had forecast the wind to be \nabout 25 knots at the western end\
  \ of Foveaux Strait , with the sea becoming high for a time \nwith a southwest swell\
  \ of 3 metres and easing.  The computer model for the combined wind \nand swell\
  \ waves provided by MetService after th e accident gave a significant wave height\
  \ in \nthe area of the accident of about 3 metres , with a note to indicate there\
  \ would be occasional \nwaves as much as 25% higher and isolated waves up to 50%\
  \ higher.   \n4.4.2.  These weather conditions were not ideal , but shoul d have\
  \ been manageable for a well  \nfounded fishing vessel the size of the Easy Rider\
  \ , provided it was operated with care.  \nNavigation at night in small vessels\
  \ carries an increased risk because the skipper s cannot see \nfar ahead to \"read\
  \ \" the waves and react accordingly.  The situation is made worse if visibility\
  \ is \nrestricted by rain.  It was not prudent to embark on the voyage that night\
  \ g iven that the Easy \nRider  was also heavily loaded and was carrying passengers\
  \ .  Other experienced fis hermen had \nread the forecast and stayed in Bluff that\
  \ night  - others had delayed their departure s until the \ncold front had passed.\
  \  The pre -arranged rendezvous with the helicopter the following morning \nwas\
  \ one likely reason for the skipper deciding to depa rt that night.  The helicopter\
  \ had been \narranged to offload supplies and equipment from 4 other vessels at\
  \ the same time.    \n4.4.3.  The Easy Rider  departed from Bluff Harbour at about\
  \ 2000 , which was just about at high tide.  \nAs the tide ebbed, the general directi\
  \ on of the tidal flow was to the west, so the skipper  would \nhave gained the\
  \ advantage of the current for the duration of the transit of Foveaux Strait.  As\
  \ \nthe Easy Rider  headed to the area of the Bishop and Clerks Islands it still\
  \ had the tidal current \nrunning with it.  In this case the tidal current would\
  \ have been running against the wind and \nthe prevailing waves.   When waves encounter\
  \ a current flowing in the opposite direction they \nget steeper, taller and closer\
  \ together.  \n4.4.4.  Another phenomenon that can alt er wave characteristics is\
  \ w hen surface waves  move towards \nshallow water .  They slow down, their wave\
  \ height  increases and the distance  between waves \ndecreases.  This behaviour\
  \ is called \"shoaling \", and the waves are said to shoal. The waves \nmay or may\
  \ not build to the point where they break , depending on how large they were to\
  \ \nbegin with and how steep the slope of the sea bed is.  In particular, waves\
  \ shoal as they pass \nover submerged banks or reefs. This can be treacherous for\
  \ vessels and ships  (World \nMeteorological Organization, 1998) .   \n4.4.5.  The\
  \ area around  the Bishop and Clerks Islands is generally shallow , at around 50\
  \ metres \ndepth.  Close in to the Islands is an  area renowned for shoaling, tidal\
  \ eddies and rips.  The \ngeneral area given for the capsize is approximate only.\
  \  No -one knows for sure  how close to \nthe Bishop and Clerks Islands the Easy\
  \ Rider  was when it capsized, but it was entirely \npredictable  for it to en counter\
  \ larger -than -the-average (significant wave height) waves in the \narea .  It\
  \ was also predictable that waves could come from different directions in such an\
  \ area.  \nA small vessel such as the Easy Rider  entering this area at night in\
  \ heavy weather would  be \nparticularly vulnerable . \n4.4.6.  The interested person\
  \ submitted that a \"rogue wave\" from a direction other than the normal \nswell\
  \ had capsized the Easy Rider .  The Commission considered this possibility and\
  \ \ndetermined that i t was possible ; however, it would not necessarily have taken\
  \ a \"rogue wave \" \nto cause the Easy Rider  to capsize in its current condition\
  \ of stability.  \n4.4.7.  The height of the Easy Rider  above the waterline was\
  \ 2.8 metres.  With the significant wave \nheight at 3 meters, an isola ted wave\
  \ 4.5 metres high can be expected (50% more than the \nsignificant wave height).\
  \  Such a wave could have easily engulf ed the Easy Rider , especially if \n \n\n\
  << Page 24 >>\n Report 12 -201 it came from the side and was standing up and breaking\
  \ (steeper) due to the complexities of \nthe tide s and wind/wave direction in the\
  \ area.   Using the same stability model that was used \nto produce the 3 conditions\
  \ of stability referred to earlier in the report, t he Commission \ncalculated that\
  \ it would have taken only about half of one tonne of sea water to  deposit on the\
  \ \nEasy Rider 's deck to reduce its GM to zero, ignoring any free  surface effect.\
  \  It need not have \nbeen a particularly large wave to achieve that.  With this\
  \ amount of water captured on the \nfishing deck and w ith the stability reserves\
  \ at near zero, the Easy Rider  would have had little \nor no resistance to being\
  \ capsized as it  rolled in response to any wave , large or small . \n4.4.8.  The\
  \ tidal current was heading to the west, the wind waves were coming from the north\
  \ west \nand the swell waves were coming fro m the southwest.  The resultant wave\
  \ spectrum anywhere \nat the western end of Foveaux Strait would have been  complex\
  \ , with the possibility of waves \ncoming from more than one  direction .  \n4.4.9.\
  \  In such an area mariners can expect nodes (areas) of lower -than -average -height\
  \ waves and \nnodes of higher -than -average -height waves.  Some of the nodes of\
  \ higher -than -average wave \nheight can include what is popularly known as \"\
  rogue wave s\".  T Janssen , an oceanographer \nat San Francisco State University\
  \ , has stated that a widel y accepted definition of a \"rogue \nwave \" is one\
  \ roughly 3 times the average height of its neighbours.  Janssen qualifie d this\
  \ by \nnoting that \"t his is a somewhat arbitrary cut -off - really, they are just\
  \ unexpectedly  large \nwaves \" (Pee ples, 2009) .  Another expert has  defined\
  \  \"rogue waves \" as ones greater than \ntwice the significant wave height (NOAA/National\
  \ Weather Service, 2012) .  \n4.4.10.  In summary, the Commission concludes  that\
  \ the forecast and actual sea conditions on that \nnight were not appropriate for\
  \ a vessel the size of the Easy Rider  to take to sea , having  \nmarginal reserve\
  \ stability.  How large the wave was that capsized the Easy Rider  is a \ndebatable\
  \ point, but the de bate does not resolve the underlying safety issue of poor vessel\
  \ \nloading resulting in  poor  stability when heading out into deteriorating weather\
  \ at night.  \n4.4.11.  Had the skipper of the Easy Rider  decided to take the route\
  \ to the east of Stewart Island he \nmight ha ve had a more sheltered trip in the\
  \ lee of the island.  However, the vessel would have \nfirst had to cross Foveaux\
  \ Strait with the wind and waves on the beam.  With the Easy Rider 's \nreduced\
  \ state of stability, it is feasible that it would have overturned be fore reaching\
  \ that lee.  \nFinding s \nThe weather conditions were not suitable for the Easy\
  \ Rider  to venture across Foveaux \nStrait at night, with marginal stability and\
  \ with passengers on board.  \nThe pre -arranged rendezvous with the helicopter\
  \ to coincide with unloading other \nvessels at Big South Cape Island possibly influenced\
  \ the skipper's decision to continue \nwith his planned departure .  \n4.5. Survival\
  \ aspects  \n4.5.1.  It is a matter of speculation to suggest what might have happened\
  \ to the passengers and crew \nwho died whe n the Easy Rider  capsized.  No bodies\
  \ were found in the sunken wreck when \ndivers made their search.  Some may have\
  \ been trapped in the upturned hull for a while and \nothers may have ended up in\
  \ the water almost immediately or soon after wards .  When \nsomeone ends up in\
  \ the water there are several factors that will determine whether they \nsurvive.\
  \  The 2 main factors are: the time it takes for rescuers to arrive; and the life-saving\
  \ \nequipment on hand to assist survival while waiting for that rescue.    \n4.5.2.\
  \  Once the p assengers and crew entered the water there would have been  several\
  \ other factors \nthat determine d their survival time s.  These included the sea\
  \ state, sea -water temperature, air \ntemperature, wind chill, age, gender, anaerobic\
  \ fitness, swimming ability and a ny physical \ninjury sustained during the capsize.\
  \   \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 25 >>\n 4.5.3.  Of the 4 bodies found following\
  \ the capsize, 3 had experienced minor but not disabling \ninjuries, and the cause\
  \ of death was recorded as drowning for all 4. This is clearly supported \nby the\
  \ presence of wate r in the lungs. There were no other medical or pathological findings\
  \ \nrelevant to the accident or survival in the water.    \n4.5.4.  Another factor\
  \ that is detrimental to cold -water survival is alcohol consumption.  Alcohol \n\
  accelerates hypothermia through increased r ates of heat loss due to increased blood\
  \ flow \nthrough the skin.  Therefore alcohol in the blood system reduces the chances\
  \ of survival  in \ncold water  (Water Safety New Zealand, 2012) .  Of the 4 bodies\
  \ recovered, one of the \npassengers had a blood -alcohol level of 125 milligrams\
  \  per 100 millilitres of blood ( 1.5 times \nthe legal limit for driving a car\
  \ ), which is consistent with impairment of decision -making and \npsychomotor co\
  \ -ordination . It is possible that this level of alcohol reduced his  survival\
  \ time \nthrough swim failure and/or hypothermia.    \n4.5.5.  One passenger and\
  \ one of the crew members reported to be asleep down below in the cabin \nat the\
  \ time of the accident had levels of THC in their blood that were consistent with\
  \ a recent \nconsumption of cannabis.  Recent consumption may have been associated\
  \ wi th mental \nimpairment to the extent that it might have affected their ability\
  \ to escape from the capsized \nvessel .  A crew member has safety responsibilities\
  \ to all on board.    \n4.5.6.  On 8 March 2011, in its report on a collision between\
  \ a jet boat and a jetski (Transport \nAccident Investigation Commission, 2011)\
  \ , the Commission made a recommendation to the \nSecretary for Transport regarding\
  \ substance impairment in the maritime sector.  The \nrecommendation reference d\
  \ persons in charge of an y craft, but the same would apply to any \ncrew member\
  \ who had responsibilities or duties to do with the safety of passengers and other\
  \ \ncrew.  The recommendation and the reply on behalf of the Secretary for Transport\
  \ are shown \nbelow:   \nUntil legislation is made setting limits for and testing\
  \ of alcohol and other \nperformance impairing substances for recreational and commercial\
  \ boat drivers, the \nrisk of alcohol -related accidents will be elevated.    \n\
  It is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address thi s safety issue by\
  \ \npromoting appropriate legislation to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol\
  \ and \nother performance impairing substances for persons in charge of recreational\
  \ and \ncommercial craft, and supporting legislation to allow testing for such level\
  \ s in these \ncases.  (005/11)    \nOn 16 March 2011 the Manager Maritime and Freight\
  \ of the Ministry of Transport replied to \nthe final recommendation:    \nThe recommendation\
  \ is that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to set \nlimits and establish\
  \ a test ing regime to address the risk of recreational and \ncommercial boating\
  \ accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance -\nimpairing substances.\
  \    \nRecreational and commercial boating is one of three areas of transport activity\
  \ \nwhere no alcohol and drug  limits or testing regime yet exists.  The introduction\
  \ of \nsuch a regime in any of these areas would be a major policy decision for\
  \ government \nthat would need to be informed by a thorough understanding of the\
  \ problem and the \npolicy options.  The Ministry t herefore intends to develop\
  \ a report to government on \nthe feasibility of a compulsory post -accident and\
  \ incident drug and alcohol testing \nregime for the aviation, maritime and rail\
  \ transport sectors.    \nAccordingly, implementation of recommendation 005/11 w\
  \ ould only be practicable \nonce the relevant policy work had been undertaken by\
  \ the Ministry, and then only if \nthe results indicated that a drug and alcohol\
  \ testing regime is a feasible option.  \nThe recommendation still had an \"open\
  \ \" status at the time this r eport was published.  \n \n \n \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n\
  \ Report 12 -201 Lifejacket s \n4.5.7.  None of the persons whose bodies were recovered\
  \ was wearing a lifejacket when located.  \nProlonged immersion in cold water normally\
  \ causes drowning by swim failure before death \nfrom hypothermia occurs.    \n\
  4.5.8.  A self -righting lifejacket will help keep the wearer's head clear of the\
  \ water and its buoyancy \nwill slow the onset of fatigue.  With a sea -water temperature\
  \ of 13\xBAC and moderate seas, an \nadult male wearing an appropriate lifejacket\
  \ could be expected to have a fair chance  of \nsurvival for up to 5  hours  (Maritime\
  \ New Zealand, 2012) .  Without flotation assistance, swim \nfailure caused by a\
  \ combination of muscle fatigue, cramps and hypothermia can be expected \nafter\
  \ about 20 -30 minutes.  The deckhand surviving some  18 hours before being rescued\
  \ is \nhighly unusual.  His survival can be partially attributed to his time spent\
  \ on the upturned hull \nbefore it sank, the flotation provided by the fuel container\
  \ that fortuitously rose to the surface \nbeside him, and a substantial amount of\
  \ willpower .   \n4.5.9.  A lifejacket's effectiveness and usefulness will depend\
  \ on a number of factors, including:    \n\u2022 the size of the lifejacket relative\
  \ to the size of the wearer  \n\u2022 the correct fitment of the lifejacket  \n\u2022\
  \ the typ e of the lifejacket  \n\u2022 the accessibility of the lifejacket  \n\u2022\
  \ the nature of the emergency.  \n4.5.10.  In this case the Easy Rider  did not\
  \ have sufficient lifejacket s for the 9 people on board.  \nInstead, it appears\
  \ that there were  only 3 adult lifejacket s and one child lifejacket .  The \n\
  interested person submitted  that there may have been 2 or 3 other lifejackets on\
  \ board ; \nhowever, she was unable to confirm the  types, size s and condition\
  \ of those lifejacket s.  She \nsubsequently revised this figure upwards to 9 lifejacket\
  \ s in total on board.  The Commission , \nhowever,  did not find evidence to support\
  \ this later claim.  The average weight of all 9 persons \non board was about 103\
  \ kilograms , and the largest person weighed  184 kilograms .  The adult \nlifejacket\
  \ s that were on board w ould not have fitted securely on some of the adults on\
  \ board, \neven if they had been able to access them.  The Maritime Rules provide\
  \ for the carriage of \nchildren's lifejacket s on commercial vessels where children\
  \ are likely to be carried, but is \nsilent on the carriage of lifejacket s for\
  \ large people.  Rule Part 91 requires skippers of \nrecreational craft to have\
  \ a lifejacket  of an appropriate size for every person on board.  Most \npeople\
  \ would understand this in the context of carrying small children, but mig ht not\
  \ \nnecessarily relate this to having over -sized lifejacket s for large people.\
  \    \n4.5.11.  Although not relevant to this accident , the Commission has noted\
  \ that Maritime Rules require \nthat an approved  lifejacket  be carried for every\
  \ person on board every recreational and \ncommercial vessel.  While an approved\
  \ lifejacket  is marked as complying with the appropriate \nstandard, other lifejacket\
  \ s are freely available for purchase that are not approved to the \nappropriate\
  \  standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some standard that\
  \ is \nnot accepted in New Zealand.  An unwary purchaser, particularly a recreational\
  \ boating \nperson, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a lifejacket\
  \  approved to New  \nZealand standards.    \n4.5.12.  There is at least one manufacturer\
  \ in New Zealand that manufactures approved lifejacket s in \nvarying sizes up to\
  \ XXXL, and will custom -make a lifejacket  to suit a person with a non -\nstandard\
  \ physique for a nominal fee.    \n4.5.13.  The key to the best chance of survival\
  \ is to have a number of lifejackets at least equal to, or \npreferably more than,\
  \ the number of people on board, and stowed in the most readily \naccessible place.\
  \  This would typically be near to, or if possible outside, the means of es cape\
  \ \nfrom the cabin.  For a boat the size of the Easy Rider  in those sea conditions,\
  \ the skipper \nshould have required everyone on deck to be wearing a lifejacket.\
  \  Apparently the 2 \npassengers sitting out on deck behind the wheelhouse were\
  \ wearing lifejacke ts, but there is \nsome question  about  whether they were properly\
  \ fitted and secured.  An improperly secured \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 27 >>\n\
  \ lifejacket can quickly dislodge when the wearer enters the water, particularly\
  \ if the wearer \nbecomes fatigued or unconscious.  The bodies of these 2 passengers\
  \ were among the 4 \nrecovered and they were not wearing lifejackets at the time\
  \ of recovery .   \n4.5.14.  The child was wearing the one child's lifejacket, but\
  \ this was placed on him more for warmth \nand there is some question about whether\
  \ it was properly sec ured on him.  That child's \nlifejacket was later found by\
  \ divers on the wreck, snagged in the deck rigging.    \n4.5.15.  For any who managed\
  \ to escape from the inverted hull, the availability of suitable lifejackets \n\
  would have improved their chances of survival, wheth er that was simply to stay\
  \ and wait for \nrescue or to swim for shore or to a life -raft.   \nLife-raft \n\
  4.5.16.  A life -raft is perhaps the most effective aid to survival in the event\
  \ of having to abandon a \nvessel, provided it can be activated.  It keeps survivors\
  \ out of the water and provides cover \nfrom the elements.  It also has basic survival\
  \ equipment inside it.  However, the Easy Rider 's \nlife-raft was only designed\
  \ for 4 people.  As noted above there were 9 people on board with an \naverage weight\
  \ of about 103 kilogram  per person.  It would not therefore have been sufficient\
  \ \nto accommodate all of the people, had they all survived the initial capsize.\
  \    \n4.5.17.  There are 2 ways a life -raft can be activated: it can be manually\
  \ released from its cradle and \nmanually inflated ; or it can automatically release\
  \ from its cradle and float to the surface, \nwhere it can either automatically\
  \ inflate or be manually inflated.    \n4.5.18.  Manual release and inflation takes\
  \ time, and in thi s case where the Easy Rider  capsized \nsuddenly, there was no\
  \ time.  The hydrostatic release mechanism is a well proven device that \nseems\
  \ to have worked on this occasion.  The life -raft was found by divers wedged between\
  \ the \nbulwarks and the wheelhouse, so i t must have released from its cradle at\
  \ some point.  There \nis an element of chance whether a life -raft floating free\
  \ from a sinking vessel will reach the \nsurface.  A lot depends on the position\
  \  of the life -raft cradle and the attitude of the vessel as it \nsinks.  From\
  \ the description of the survivor , the Easy Rider  sank stern first and upside\
  \ down.  \nThe life -raft would therefore have been prevented from floating free\
  \ until the vessel rolled as it \nsank to the sea  bed (it was initially found lying\
  \ on its side) .  It seems to have become wedged \nwithin the bulwarks before it\
  \ could float free as the vessel began to right itself under water.    \nTrip reports\
  \  \n4.5.19.  There was a time delay of about 14 hours between when the accident\
  \ happened and when \nthe Easy Rider  was reporte d overdue.  That was when the\
  \ vessel failed to arrive at Big South \nCape Island for the rendezvous with the\
  \ helicopter.  Even then some time was taken to \nconsider reasons for it s not\
  \ arriv ing.   \n4.5.20.  The Easy Rider 's skipper radioed Bluff Fishermen's Radio\
  \ on de parture from Bluff and \nsubmitted a trip report, which said where he was\
  \  and where he was going and gave an \nestimated time of arrival.  The skipper\
  \ did not say which route he was intending to take to get \nthere.  This type of\
  \ trip report has its merits but a lso has its limitations , because there are no\
  \ \nintermediate check -in points and no close -out report on arrival at the destination.\
  \  To be truly \neffective, lodging a trip report should result in an automatic\
  \ response by the receiver if some \npredetermined check or close -out is not met.\
  \  Even a pre -arranged phone call with another \nfamily member can be beneficial,\
  \ but a broadcast over a common frequency has the benefit of \nother vessels in\
  \ the vicinity knowing the vessel's whereabouts.    \n4.5.21.  The very high frequenc\
  \ y radio coverage on the west coast of Stewart Island is limited, which \ncould\
  \ have preclude d the skipper closing out a trip report with Bluff Fishermen's Radio.\
  \  Under \nthese circumstances an intermediate checkpoint, such as at the Bishop\
  \ and Clerk Islands , \nwould have provided a useful check on progress before leaving\
  \ the area of good VHF radio \ncoverage.    \n \n \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Report 12\
  \ -201 Emergency position indicating radio bea con  \n4.5.22.  The Easy Rider  was\
  \ required by Maritime Rules to carry a 406 megahertz emergency position \nindicating\
  \ radio bea con.  The one it carried complied with the minimum requirements.  It\
  \ was \nrequired to be removed from its bracket, manually activated and taken with\
  \ the survivor(s).  \nWhen above water it is a quick and accurate method of alerting\
  \ search and rescue that \nsome thing has gone wrong.  The emergency position indicating\
  \ radio beacon  transmits it s \nactual position via satellite to the search and\
  \ rescue co -ordination centre.  The transmitted \nmessage also includes other information\
  \ that will assist the authorities in th e search and \nrescue.    \n4.5.23.  Divers\
  \ later found the beacon still in its bracket, with the aerial in its stowage position\
  \ folded \ninto the bracket . The beacon was operating with the light -emitting\
  \ diode flashing weakly.  This \nlight-emitting diode also functions as  the strobe\
  \ .  However, it cannot be inferred  that it had \nbeen manually activated by someone\
  \ on board.  The beacon complied with international \nstandards that required waterproof\
  \ testing at a depth of 10 metres for 5 minutes .  The depth \nat which the beacon\
  \ was found was far in excess of this, so the casing could have leaked and \na short\
  \ circuit formed , causing the operation of the beacon.  The unit is activated by\
  \ pushing  \ndown a short -travel -length plunger that depresses a rubber diaphragm\
  \  activating a switch .  \nWith an external pressure of 400 kilo pascals  and a\
  \ pressure differential  of 300 kilo pascals \nthere may have been enough external\
  \ pressure to depress the diaphragm to switch the unit \non.  In either of the above\
  \ conditions the beacon would have been transmitting into short  \ncircuit , and\
  \ after the amount of time it was submerged in the water the batteries would have\
  \ \nbeen close to exhaustion.  Whatever the reason for the beacon activating , unless\
  \ it was above \nthe sea surface its tr ansmission would  not have been picked up\
  \ by the satellites.    \n4.5.24.  Float -free beacons are available in New Zealand\
  \ for between $800 and $1300.  These \nbeacons are usually mounted outside the wheelhouse\
  \ and automatically release from their \nbracket s and float to t he surface, in\
  \ much the same way that a float -free life -raft does.  Like \nthe life -raft,\
  \ however, there is a possibility that the beacon will become entangled on its way\
  \ to \nthe surface in the event of a capsize.  Having it mounted outside the wheelhouse\
  \ means  that \nit is more accessible for survivors to retrieve from a vessel that\
  \ does not sink immediately, \nsuch as in the case of the Easy Rider . Despite its\
  \ limitations , a float -free type emergency \nposition indicating radio beacon\
  \  will have a better chance of success than a manually \nactivated one inside the\
  \ wheelhouse.    \n4.5.25.  There is another type of emergency position indicating\
  \ radio beacon  that can increase the \nchance s of survival : the personal locator\
  \ beacon.  It is not required to be carried by Maritime \nRules but can significantly\
  \ improve the chance s of survival in some circumstances.  It is small \n(about\
  \ the size of a cigarette packet) and fit s easily into a jacket pocket.  The personal\
  \ locator \nbeacon retails at about $600 and can be hired for $20 per day.  W hen\
  \ activated , it perform s \nthe same function as a larger emergency position indicating\
  \ radio beacon , transmitting an \naccurate position and supporting information\
  \ via a satellite to the search and rescue \ncoordination centre.    \n4.5.26. \
  \ One advantage of these smaller  beacons is that they can be worn by crew all of\
  \ the time when \nworking on deck.  They do have the same limitation as larger beacons\
  \ in that they will not be \neffective under water.  In the Easy Rider 's case,\
  \ had the surviving deckhand been wearing one \nand a ctivated it immediately, the\
  \ authorities would have been alerted to the vessel's plight, \npossibly within\
  \ minutes, and directed the search to the exact spot where the capsize occurred.\
  \  \nIf any of the other occupants  had survived the initial capsize they might\
  \ have survived.  \nBecause of its small size and weight, the personal locator beacon\
  \ can be used for other land -\nbased activities as well.    \n4.5.27.  A personal\
  \ locator beacon cannot be substituted for an emergency position indicating radio\
  \ \nbeacon  unless it meets  the stringent standards laid down for the watertightness,\
  \ flotation, \ntransmission life when activated, and transmission aerial requirements\
  \ of an  emergency \nposition indicating radio beacon , but it is a useful safety\
  \ enhancement that private and \ncommercial operators might like to consider.  \
  \  \n \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 29 >>\n Other available options for position\
  \ monitoring and tracking  \n4.5.28.  Another method of determining the position\
  \ of a vessel at sea from ashore is the automatic \nidentification system , which\
  \ is a vessel tracking system utilising very high frequency radio \ntransmitters\
  \ and receivers combined with a positioning system.  The signals transmitted by\
  \ \nthe vessel can be tracked by shore -based stations using receiving aerials around\
  \ the coast, \nand in some areas of the world, by satellites fitted with automatic\
  \ identification system \nreceivers.    \n4.5.29.  The system was initially designed\
  \ as an anti -collision aid for larger ships, but has since been \nfound useful\
  \ for shore -based monitoring of shipping movemen ts near and in ports and \nharbours.\
  \  Very high frequency radio works essentially on line  of sight , so the range\
  \ of any \nsystem that uses it is limited , unless repeater stations or the satellite\
  \ option s are used .  Such \na system would have its limitations in t he context\
  \ of the Easy Rider 's operation.  A dedicated \nshore station would have to have\
  \ been monitoring the track and have a reason for raising an \nalarm.    \n4.5.30.\
  \  When the Easy Rider  sank it was probably still within very high frequency radio\
  \ coverage; \nhowever, it would soon have moved out of very high frequency radio\
  \ range as it headed down \nthe west coast of Stewart Island.  Had an observer been\
  \ monitoring the vessel it would have \ngiven early warning that something was amiss\
  \ when  its automatic identification sys tem signal \nceased.  This assumes that\
  \ someone , somewhere was actually watching the vessel at a \ncertain time, which\
  \ is unlikely considering the number of vessels fitted with automatic \nidentification\
  \ system  compared with the number of observers.  However, automatic \nidentification\
  \ system  data can be and is recorded, so once a vessel has been  reported as \n\
  overdue, that information could be useful for determining the last recorded position\
  \ of the \nvessel in the absence of an emergency position indicating radio bea con\
  \ being activated.    \n4.5.31.  At the time of writing there was no requirement\
  \ in New Zealand for fishing vessels, especially \nthose the size of the Easy Rider\
  \ , to be fitted with an automatic identification system.  The \nInternational Maritime\
  \ Organization 's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea  \nrequires\
  \ automatic identification system s to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships\
  \ with \ngross tonnage s of 300 or more, and all passenger ships regardless of size.\
  \  An automatic \nidentification system \"class B\" transponder (transmitter and\
  \ receiver) suitable for fitting to an \ninshore fishing vessel can be purchased\
  \ in New Zealand for about $2000.    \n4.5.32.  There are also several commercially\
  \ available satellite -based tracking systems available from \nNew Zealand providers.\
  \  Some of these systems are used extensively by emergency and \nrescue services,\
  \ others are used by aircraft operators for determining the loca tions of their\
  \ \nassets.  The system provided to the Royal New Zealand Coastguard was used extensively\
  \ by \nthe Police search and rescue co -ordinators during the search for the Easy\
  \ Rider .   \n4.5.33.  A satellite -based tracking system use s a tracking unit\
  \ that is instal led in the asset.  Using the \nglobal positioning system the unit\
  \ calculates its position and transmits that information in real \ntime by satellite\
  \ and by cellular network to the provider's secure server.  The server can then\
  \ \nbe accessed via the Internet by t he subscriber to monitor the status of the\
  \ asset and in some \ncases communicate with the asset.   \n4.5.34.  There is a\
  \ cost to install the tracking unit in the asset , and ongoing monthly cost s. \
  \ There is \nalso an additional cost for every position fix , as this incurs satellite\
  \ transmission fees and use \nof the provider's server.  At the time of writing\
  \ the cost  of the transponder  from one of the New \nZealand providers was about\
  \ $1250 , with ongoing monthly costs of about $25 for the service \nand position\
  \ fixes , calculated at about $6 per day assuming half -hourly transmissions.  \
  \  \n4.5.35.  Similar to the automatic identification system , there are limitations\
  \ to the usefulness of these \nsatellite -based systems for alerting someone to\
  \ a situation such as the Easy Rider  capsizing.  \nAgain,  someone would need to\
  \ be monitoring the track of the vessel 24 hours each day  for it  \nto be truly\
  \ effective as an emergency -alerting system.  \n4.5.36.  These various other means\
  \ of tracking a vessel are only mentioned here to highlight their \navailability\
  \ and potentia l use.  The limitations described for each would preclude mandating\
  \ \n \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n Report 12 -201 their use on board fishing vessels.  Nevertheless,\
  \ they are options that vessel operators \nshould  consider.  \n \nFinding s  \n\
  The Easy Rider  did not have sufficient life -saving equipment for the 9 persons\
  \ on board.  \nThe Easy Rider 's manually operated emergency position  indicating\
  \ radio beacon had \nprobably not been  intentionally  activated and was still stowed\
  \ in its bracket within the \nwheelhouse when the vessel sank.  \nFloat -free emergency\
  \ position  indicating radio beacon s and the enhancement of people \ncarrying personal\
  \ locator beacon s will improve the chances of being noticed and rescued, \nparticularly\
  \ in the event of a sudden or catastrophic event such as a capsize.  \nIt has not\
  \ been possible to deter mine how many,  if any , of the 8 persons who died survived\
  \ \nthe initial capsize, and if so for how long they survived.  \nThere were as\
  \ few as 4 approved lifejacket s on board the Easy Rider  to be shared among 9 \n\
  people, which not only contravened Maritime Rules but significantly reduced the\
  \ chances \nof persons not wearing lifejacket s surviving in the water after the\
  \ vessel capsized.  \nThe Easy Rider 's life -raft was in current survey and was\
  \ properly installed, but was not able \nto float free to the surface becau se it\
  \ became lodged between the wheelhouse and the \nbulwarks as the vessel was sinking.\
  \  Rated for 4 persons only, the life -raft did not have \nsuffic ient capacity\
  \ to cater for the 9 persons on board.  \n4.6. Regulatory  \nRecord -keeping  \n\
  4.6.1.  Prior to the introduction of Maritime Rule Part 21 (Safe Ship Management)\
  \  in 1997 , the Easy \nRider  was not required to be in survey and had never been\
  \ required to undergo a stability \nassessment.  Even then it was not engaged in\
  \ trawling or lifting what was considered to be \nheavy weights, so there was still\
  \ no requirement for a stability assessment.    \n4.6.2.  It was not until the Easy\
  \ Rider  was modified  for inshore trawling  in 2003 that a stability \nassessment\
  \ was required.  This assessment was carried out in September/October 2003 and \n\
  a fit-for-purpose certificate for inshore trawling was issued.  The Easy Rider \
  \ went through a \nsuccession of owners between 2003 and 2005, and at some time\
  \ during this period the \nstability assessment booklet was lost or not handed on\
  \ to another owner.    \n4.6.3.  The stability information in that booklet would\
  \ have been superseded by the vario us \nmodifications made to the vessel over the\
  \ years.  For example , the removal of the trawl gantry \nwould have improved the\
  \ stability by removing weight from higher up on the vessel.  However, \nthere were\
  \ a number of vessels built to the same design, what bec ame known as the \n\"Owenga\
  \ \" design, and it was recognised early on that the design had limited reserve\
  \ stability.  \nIn some cases ballast was added to the vessels to improve their\
  \ stability.  In one case the \nsurveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in\
  \ the  wheelhouse warning skippers not to \nload too much on deck.  These earlier\
  \ observations are supported by the calculations made by \nthe Commission.    \n\
  4.6.4.  Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient\
  \ information \nabout the Easy Rider , despite the fact that it was a vessel that\
  \ was still actively in the  maritime \nregulatory  system.  Maritime New Zealand\
  \ was not able to find the older part of the ship file.  \nConsequently the Commission\
  \ had to rely on records from other vessels in or der to make a \nreasonable assessment\
  \ of the Easy Rider 's stability.   \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 31 >>\n 4.6.5.\
  \  When the Easy Rider  was converted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo\
  \ a \nsimplified stability assessment, which it did.  Unfortunately, when the records\
  \ were sourced \nfrom the s afe ship management company only partial details of\
  \ the inclining test and stability \ncalculation were available.  These details\
  \ did not include a copy of the stability advice letter \nsaid to have been sent\
  \ to the owner.  Such a letter would normally include  recommendations \non the\
  \ loading of the vessel.    \n4.6.6.  When the Commission made an urgent safety\
  \ recommendation to the Director of Maritime \nNew Zealand in April 2012, to notify\
  \ owners of other \"Owenga \" design vessels and alert them \nto the stability characteristics\
  \ of their vessels, the lack of current records made this task \ndifficult , and\
  \ even today some doubt remains over how many fishing vessels built to this \ndesign\
  \ still exist.    \n4.6.7.  With the introductio n of the Maritime Transport Act\
  \ the maritime ship records were transferred \nfrom the Marine Department of the\
  \ Ministry of Transport to the newly  formed Maritime Safety \nAuthority (now Maritime\
  \ New Zealand ).  Later , with the introduction of Safe Ship Manageme nt, \nthese\
  \ records were transferred to Marine and Industrial.  Marine and Industrial was\
  \ the entity \nthat had formerly been the survey division of the Mari ne D epartment,\
  \ then became one of the \nbigger safe ship management companies.  Confronted with\
  \ storage i ssues , Marine and \nIndustrial either returned the ship files to the\
  \ vessel owners that wanted them  or had the files \ndestroyed.    \n4.6.8.  Transfer\
  \ s between safe ship management companies of ship files and information from ship\
  \ \nfiles have been a problem in the past.  Safe Ship Management companies are commercial\
  \ \noperators competing for the same clients.  Unless there is a central repository\
  \ for information \non ships that remain in the maritime system, these commercial\
  \ interests could result in \nimportant records being l ost in future.  The safe\
  \ ship management system is about to undergo \na change to the Maritime Operator\
  \ Safety System (MOSS).  The Commission recommends that \nthe Director of Maritime\
  \ New Zealand adopt a strategy under the Public Records Act 2005 \nthat ensures\
  \  that important ship records are maintained until vessels make permanent exit\
  \ s \nfrom the New Zealand maritime system and for a specified number of years following\
  \ that.    \nStatus of the Easy Rider  and the accident voyage  \n4.6.9.  The Commission\
  \ received a  substantive  submission from the interested person regarding  the\
  \ \nstatus of the Easy Rider  and the nature and purpose of its voyage at the time\
  \ of the accident.  \nThe key components of this submission can be summarised, as\
  \ follows:  \n\uF0B7 the voyage of the Easy Rider  on the day of the accident comprised\
  \ 2 legs.  The first leg \ninvolved transporting family members to Big South Cape\
  \ Island  to gather muttonbirds.  The \nsecond leg (commencing from the moment the\
  \ passengers left the vessel) was less clear.  \nIt may or may not  have involved\
  \ commercial fishing (the  interested person  could not \nconfirm  the intentions\
  \ of the skipper)  \n\uF0B7 at the time of the accident (i.e. on the first leg)\
  \ the Easy Rider  was not a commercial fishing \nvessel but rather a pleasure vessel\
  \  \n\uF0B7 at the time of the  accident (i.e. on the first leg) the Easy Rider\
  \  was not engaged in \ncommercial fishing.  Rather it was engaged on a private\
  \ and \"customary\" voyage for the \npurpose of transporting family members to Big\
  \ South Cape Island to gather muttonbird s in \naccordance w ith their  customary\
  \ rights, as affirmed by the Titi (Muttonbird) Islands \nRegulations 1978  \n\uF0B7\

  \ for the purpose \nof gathering muttonbird s. \n \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Report 12\
  \ -201 Customary voyage under the Treaty of Waitangi and Titi (Muttonbird) Islands\
  \ Regulations  \n4.6.10.  The Commission's statutory purpose is to determine the\
  \ circumstances and causes of \naccidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences\
  \ in the future.  Accordingly, it was not \nappropriate for the Commission to make\
  \ findings about the interested person's submission \nregarding Maori customary\
  \ rights and the Treaty of Waitangi unless those rig hts in some way \ncontributed\
  \  to the circumstances and causes of the Easy Rider capsizing and sinking.  \n\
  However it is clear from the Titi (Muttonbird) Islands Regulations 1978 that Rakiura\
  \ Maori \nhave customary rights to take mutton birds from the Titi Island s.  The\
  \ Commission \nacknowledges that Rakiura Maori have these rights and observes that\
  \ the Waitangi Tribunal \nacknowledged the appropriateness of these regulations\
  \ in its 1991 Ngai Tahu Report  (Wai \n27). \nThe Commission also notes the interested\
  \ person submitted a memorandum from Sir Tipene \nO'Reagan regarding the purpose\
  \ of the Easy Rider voyage and the heritage surrounding such \nvoyages.  In that\
  \ memorandum he said that:  \nThe rights of access to the [Titi] islands stem from\
  \ a set of statutory and regulatory \narrangements specifically developed over generations\
  \ to protect the rights of Hopu \nTiti; those rights are rooted in a customary activity\
  \ protected by Article II of the Treaty \nof Waitangi.  The exercise of those rights\
  \ necessarily involves voyaging and its thus \narguable that such voyaging is subject\
  \ to the same protections.   \nI am not arguing that voyaging should be undertaken\
  \ carelessly and without due and \nproper care to a high standard of seamanship\
  \ and ne ither - as I understand it - is \n[the interested person].  \n4.6.11. \
  \ The Commission  agrees that, even if the voyage had been  specifically for the\
  \ purpose of \ncarrying Rakiura Maori to the Titi Islands for the muttonbird season,\
  \ the voyage would still \nhave need ed to be carried out with due proper care .\
  \ \nCommercial vessel vs pleasure craft  \n4.6.12.  The distinction between a pleasure\
  \ craft (or a recreational vessel) and a commercial vessel is \nimportant.  If the\
  \ Easy Rider  had been operating as a commercial fishing vessel at the time  of\
  \ \nthe accident, it would have been subject to the Maritime Transport Act, the\
  \ Fisheries Act and \nthe Maritime Rules .  These rules were more stringent when\
  \ applied to commercial fishing \nvessels than when applied  to pleasure craft.\
  \  For example : a commercia l fishing ship could not \ncarry passengers; a minimum\
  \ number of crew were required on board the vessel; the skipper \nwas required to\
  \ hold an appropriate certificate; and the vessel needed to carry a life -raft or\
  \ \nEPIRB (Maritime New Zea land) . \n4.6.13.  By comparison, a skipper of a pleasure\
  \ craft (although still subject to the Maritime Transport \nAct and the Maritime\
  \ Rules ) did not need to have a maritime qualification, could carry other \npeople\
  \ on their  vessel, and there was no requirement for the vessel to have a life -raft\
  \ or \nemergency position indicating radio beacon .  However, there was a key requirement\
  \ to have \none approved lifejacket  for each person on board.  \n4.6.14.  From\
  \ time to time owners of commercial f ishing vessels would want to use their vessels\
  \ as \nrecreational craft or for private voyages.  Evidence reviewed by the Commission\
  \ showed that \nsafe ship management companies would allow this to happen provided\
  \ that the owners \nsatisfied certain criteria.  Fo r example, an owner would need\
  \ to inform the Ministry for Primary \nIndustries that they did not intend to catch\
  \ fish commercially .  The owner t hen needed  to \ninform the safe ship management\
  \ company of the date (s) that their vessel would be used as a \npleasure  craft.\
  \  Once completed, the owner could not use their  vessel for hire or reward.  \n\
  Evidence showed that Maritime New Zealand was aware of this practice .  \n4.6.15.\
  \  Turning to the Easy Rider , a submission from the interested  person  claimed\
  \  that the vessel \nwas operati ng as a pleasure craft at the time of its accident\
  \ and that the purpose of the \naccident voyage was to transport passengers to Big\
  \ South Cape Island to prepare for hunting \nmuttonbird s, as was their customary\
  \ right.  The interested  person , in other words, was \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<<\
  \ Page 33 >>\n claiming that the skipper did not need to have an appropriate certificate\
  \ and  that he was \nallowed to carry people other than crew.  \n4.6.16.  The evidence\
  \ collected by the Commission, however, did not support this claim.  For example,\
  \ \nthe eviden ce showed that the Easy Rider  was registered as a commercial fishing\
  \ vessel at the \ntime of the accident and that it was still owned by AZ1 Enterprises\
  \ Limited.  Section 2 of the \nMaritime Transport Act state d that a pleasure boat\
  \ did not include a ship that  was operated by \na business.  Further, the Maritime\
  \ Transport Act state d that a pleasure boat did not include \" a \nship that [was]\
  \  used on any voyage for pleasure if it [was]  normally used or intended to be\
  \ \nnormally used as a fishing ship or for the carriage  of passengers or cargo\
  \ for hire or reward\".  \nEvidence shows that t he Easy Rider  had been used to\
  \ fish commercially , as recent ly as 6 days \nbefore the accident.  \n4.6.17. \
  \ In terms of the accident voyage, the Commission did not find records proving that\
  \ the owner of \nthe Easy Rider  had satisfied the criteria for converting the Easy\
  \ Rider  from a fishing vessel to a \npleasure craft.  There was no evidence that\
  \ the vessel had been deregistered and that the \nowner had informed the Ministry\
  \ for Primary Industries and the safe ship management \ncompany that the Easy Rider\
  \  would be used as a pleasure craft on the day of the accident.  \nNor was any\
  \ of the fishing gear removed from the vessel.  On the contrary, the Easy Rider\
  \  was \nloaded with salt, ice, cod pots and a significant quant ity of fish bait\
  \ on the accident voyage \n(not consistent with a pleasure voyage only).  In addition,\
  \ the surviving deckhand confirmed \nthat he had been  on board the vessel as part\
  \ of the crew and that he had been  expecting to \ngo fishing and to be paid accord\
  \ ingly.  Contrary to  the interested  person's  submission, the \nsurviving crew\
  \ member did not understand the accident voyage to be a private voyage for the \n\
  sole purpose of carrying people and their equipment to prepare for muttonbird  hunting.\
  \  \n4.6.18.  All these factors support the Commission's view that the skipper was\
  \ intending to operate the \nEasy Rider  as a fishing vessel on the accident voyage\
  \ , albeit after offloading his passengers \nand their cargo .  This meant that\
  \ the skipper should not have carrie d passengers on the \naccident voyage (which\
  \ he did) and he should have had an inshore launch master's certificate \n(which\
  \ he did not).  \nSafe ship management  \n4.6.19.  Every New Zealand flagged commercial\
  \ vessel has to comply with the safe ship management \nrequirements provided under\
  \ Maritime Rule Part 21.  Safe ship management require s vessel \nowners to be responsible\
  \ for  safety  and pollution prevention in the day -to-day operation of \ntheir\
  \ vessels.   \n4.6.20.  The safe ship management system aims to ensure that all\
  \ aspects of the operation remain fit  \nfor purpose and includes systems for hazard\
  \ management, crew training and maintaining the \ncondition of the vessel.  These\
  \ are to be detailed in a safe ship management manual, which \nhas to be developed\
  \ by individual vessel owners to be specific to their vessels.  The checks \nand\
  \ maintenance work specified in the manual and maintenance plan s had to be done\
  \ as \nscheduled, and recorded in a logbook (or similar) to show that vessel safety\
  \ was being \nmanaged throughout the year, not just on surv ey day5. \n4.6.21. \
  \ Serious responsibilities come with the ownership and operation of a vessel.  These\
  \ are clearly \nstated in the Maritime Transport Act 1994 , the Fisheries Act 1996\
  \ , the Maritime Rules and \nthe Health and Safety in Employment Act  1992 .  These\
  \ responsib ilities were  put in place to \nensure the safe operation of a vessel\
  \ and compliance with the requirements of New Zealand \nlaw.  Non -compliance could\
  \  lead to serious or tragic consequences, as it did in this case.  \n4.6.22.  The\
  \ owner of the Easy Rider  did not appear to understand the concept of safe ship\
  \ \nmanagement  although it appears that it was making an attempt to comply.  The\
  \ fundamental \nproblem was that the owner seemed to be  under the impression that\
  \ safe ship management \n                                                      \
  \  \n5  Safe Ship Management:  Your Guide to Entry.  Maritime New Zealand publication,\
  \ pg 3.  \n \n\n<< Page 34 >>\n Report 12 -201 was an exercise that the company\
  \ had to go t hrough to enable the vessel to catch fish and to \nsell it commercially.\
  \   \n4.6.23.  The Easy Rider  had entered the safe ship management system on 6\
  \ September 2011 , when \nMaritime New Zealand issued AZ1 Enterprises Limited with\
  \ a safe ship management \ncertificate (parag raphs 3.4.6 to 3.4.12).  This s afe\
  \ ship management membership meant that \nthe owner had to (among other things):\
  \  \n\uF0B7 ensure that the skipper and crew complied with the procedures in the\
  \ safe ship \nmanagement manual  \n\uF0B7 ensure that the skipper and crew held\
  \ appropria te qualifications  \n\uF0B7 have a valid SSM certificate displayed prominently\
  \ on the vessel at all times  \n\uF0B7 maintain the vessel in a fit -for-purpose\
  \ condition at all times.  \n4.6.24.  It also meant that the skipper had similar\
  \ responsibilities, including an obligation to ensure \nthat:  \n\uF0B7 the vessel\
  \ was operated safely, and that the safety and wellbeing of all passengers and \n\
  crew, and the safety of cargo were  properly managed  \n\uF0B7 all personnel employed\
  \ on board were properly trained to carry out their duties safely  \n\uF0B7 all\
  \ personnel employed on board had appropriate seafarer qualifications.  \n4.6.25.\
  \  The evidence reviewed by the Commission, however, showed that the owner and the\
  \ skipper \ndid not meet all of their safe ship management obligations on the day\
  \ of the accident.  In \nparticular, the evidence sh owed that the owner : \n\uF0B7\
  \ knew that the skipper was intending to fish commercially on the day of the accident\
  \ after \noffloading his passengers and their equipment on Big South Cape Island\
  \  \n\uF0B7 knew that  the skipper did not have the required  maritime qualification\
  \  \n\uF0B7 did not arrange for a Maritime New Zealand safety inspector to conduct\
  \ a compliance \nsafety inspection of the Easy Rider  by the due date (being 6 March\
  \ 2012).  \n4.6.26.  The evidence also showed that the skipper:  \n\uF0B7 operated\
  \ the Easy Rider  without the appropriate maritime q ualification  \n\uF0B7 allowed\
  \ passengers and muttonbird  cargo on board the Easy Rider  even though the Easy\
  \ \nRider  would operat e as a commercial fishing vessel once the people had been\
  \ landed \nashore  \n\uF0B7 allowed the Easy Rider  to sail poorly loaded and without\
  \ adequate reserves of stability to \ncomplete the accident voyage  \n\uF0B7 deliberately\
  \ thwarted the Maritime New Zealand safety inspector from completing his \nsafety\
  \ compliance inspection of the Easy Rider  before the vessel sailed on the accident\
  \ \nvoyage.  \n4.6.27.  From the way the skipp er loaded the Easy Rider  for the\
  \ accident voyage, it appears that he did \nnot understand the concept of vessel\
  \ stability.  The fundamentals of stability were not covered \nin the qualified\
  \ fishing deckhand  certificate  (which he had) ; however , they were  covere d\
  \ in \nboth the inshore launch master's certificate and the local launch operator's\
  \ certificate  (which \nhe did not have but which he needed to have to skipper the\
  \ Easy Rider ).  The syllabus for \nthese certificates include d the requirement\
  \ to \" understand what i s meant by good stability \nand poor stability and recognise\
  \ the warning signs of poor stability \".  It also required the \nskipper to \"\
  \ describe the effect on stability of:  \n\uF0B7 raising and lowering weights  \n\
  \uF0B7 freely suspended weights  \n\uF0B7 free fluid surface  \n \nReport 12 -201\
  \ \n<< Page 35 >>\n \uF0B7 low freeboard  \n\uF0B7 obstructed freeing ports\" .\
  \ \n4.6.28.  Apart from obtaining the requisite qualification, the skipper could\
  \ have accessed any one of \nmany online documents aimed at teaching stability.\
  \  Two such examples were \"A guide to \nfishing vessel stability\"  (Maritime New\
  \ Zealand, 2011)  and the document appended to this \nreport entitled \"Safety practices\
  \ related to small fishing vessel stability \" (Food and Agriculture \nOrganization\
  \ of the United Nations, 2009) .   \n4.6.29.  Understanding t he basics of ship\
  \ stability is a fundamental requirement for any commercial \noperator.  It is a\
  \ fundamental requirement for anyone operating a craft of any sort, including \n\
  people in charge of recreational craft.  \n4.6.30.  The fact that the skipper did\
  \ not have these qualifications and, therefore, did not receive \nformal training\
  \ on the fundamentals of vessel stability explains, in part, why he allowed the\
  \ \nEasy Rider  to sail overloaded and without adequate reserves of stabili ty to\
  \ complete the \naccident voyage.  \n4.6.31.  The submission received from the interested\
  \  person claimed  that AZ1 Ente rprises Limited did \nnot \"own\" the vessel as\
  \ it had been gifted to the skipper by a family member.  Accordingly, AZ1 \nEnterprises\
  \ Limited  was not resp onsible for performing the safe ship management obligations\
  \ \nin respect of the Easy Rider .   \n4.6.32.  The Commission sought advice from\
  \ Maritime New Zealand on this point.  Maritime New \nZealand confirmed that:  \n\
  The 1983 Fisheries Act has been replaced by the Fisherie s Act 1996 and section\
  \ \n103 of the new Act now provides for vessel registration for fisheries purposes\
  \ \nplacing the obligation on registration on the operator of the vessel.  Under\
  \ this new \nAct, \"operator\" includes any person who has lawful possession of\
  \ the  ship.  The \nFishServe register states the operator of Easy Rider as AZ1\
  \ Enterprises Ltd \u2026 \nUnder maritime law, a valid Safe Ship Management (SSM)\
  \ certificate must be held \nto operate a commercial fishing ship.  Part 21 of the\
  \ maritime rules requires the \nowner  of the ship to apply for this certificate.\
  \  According to Mar itime New Zealand \nrecords, AZ1 Enterprises Limited applied\
  \ to the Director of Maritime New Zealand as \nthe owner of the Easy Rider for a\
  \ SSM certificate on 7 July 2011.  The SSM \ncertificate was is sued to AZ1 Enterprises\
  \ Limited on 6 September 2011.  \nIn light of the above, Maritime New Zealand considers\
  \ AZ1 Enterprises Limited to be \nthe owner of Easy Rider.  \n4.6.33.  The interested\
  \  person then submitted that the vessel's safe ship management certificate had\
  \ \nautomatically lapsed before the accident voyage , thereby turning the Easy Rider\
  \  into a \npleasure craft and releasing the owner and skipper from all safe ship\
  \ management \nobligations.  The interested person  based this argument on the fact\
  \ that the Maritime New \nZealand inspector had failed to complete the Easy Rider\
  \  safety compliance inspection by 6 \nMarch 2012 (a requirement of the Easy Rider\
  \ 's safe ship management certificate, which \nMaritime New Zealand issued for the\
  \ vessel on 6 September 2011 ).  Accordingly, w hen the \nEasy Rider  sailed on\
  \ the accident voyage (15 March 2012) a condition of its safe ship \nmanagement\
  \ certificate had not been met.  \n4.6.34.  The Commission sought further advice\
  \ from Maritime New Zealand on this point.  Maritime \nNew Zealand confirmed that:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 when a ship is normally used, or is intended to be normally used, as\
  \ a fishing vessel it is a \ncommercial ship  \n\uF0B7 in these circumstances, the\
  \ commercial ship must have a valid SSM certificate, as per Part \n21 of the Maritime\
  \ Rules  \n \n\n<< Page 36 >>\n Report 12 -201 \uF0B7 where a ship fails to have\
  \ such a c ertificate , the owner/operator of the ship is in breach of \nthe Maritime\
  \ Rules  and the Maritime Transport Act ; however, this failure does not cause \n\
  the ship in question to become a pleasure craft.  \n4.6.35.  The Commission examined\
  \ other matters when considering the interested person's  \nsubmission that the\
  \ Easy Rider  had been outside the safe ship management system at the \ntime of\
  \ the accident.  For example, the skipper's actions before and on the day of the\
  \ accident \nvoyage strongly indicated 2 things: first, that the Easy Rider  was\
  \ being operated as a \ncommercial fishing vessel ; and, second, that he and the\
  \ owner had every intention of \ncontinuing to operate the Easy Rider  within the\
  \ safe ship management system.  This first \ncontention is supported by the discussion\
  \ in the  section above (pleasure versus commercial \nvessel) and by the fact that\
  \ the skipper had fished and declared a commercial catch after 6 \nMarch 2012 (i.e.\
  \ after the date for completing the safety compliance audit).  Therefore if (as\
  \ \nthe interested person  claimed) the Easy Rider  safe ship management certificate\
  \ had expire d \non 6 March 2012, the skipper continued to fish commercially after\
  \ this date contrary to the \nFisheries Act.  \n4.6.36.  The first contention is\
  \ also supported by the fact that section 2 of the Maritime Tr ansport Act \nstates\
  \ that a pleasure craft cannot be a ship that is operated or provided by a business.\
  \  In \nother words, the fact that AZ1 Enterprises Limited owned the Easy Rider\
  \  and operated a \nfishing business in relation to that vessel meant that the Easy\
  \  Rider  could not be a pleasure \ncraft under section 2 of the Maritime Transport\
  \ Act.  \n4.6.37.  The second contention is supported by the fact that the skipper\
  \ made arrangements with the \nMaritime New Zealand safety inspector for him to\
  \ complete the compliance inspecti on before \nthe Easy Rider  was to leave on the\
  \ accident voyage.  For example, on 13 March (2 days before \nthe accident voyage),\
  \ the skipper spoke with the inspector and arranged for him to return the \nnext\
  \ day to complete the inspection.  When the inspector re turned the next day, the\
  \ skipper \nasked him to return one hour later.  The inspector did this but upon\
  \ beginning the inspection \nhe realised that the skipper was not fully prepared\
  \ for it.  He and the skipper then agreed that \nthe inspector would return on 16\
  \  March 2012 to complete the compliance inspection \n(paragraphs 3.1.3 to 3.1.7).\
  \  \n4.6.38.  Although it turned out that the skipper had no intention of keeping\
  \ this appointment with the \ninspector, the skipper's actions caused the inspector\
  \ to believe that the Easy Ride r would \ncontinue to remain within the safe ship\
  \ management system.  At no time did the skipper \nconfirm (or even intimate ) to\
  \ the inspector that this was to change.  \nFinding s  \nThe skipper's intention\
  \ was for the Easy Rider  to operat e as a commercial fishing vessel on \nthe accident\
  \ voyage , as he fully intended to go fishing commercially once his passengers and\
  \ \ntheir equipment  had been offloaded . \nNeither the owner nor the skipper sought\
  \ or was given a dispensation by the safe ship \nmanage ment company or the Director\
  \ of Maritime New Zealand to operate as a pleasure \nvessel for the accident voyage,\
  \ which meant that the Easy Rider  was a commercial fishing \nvessel and should\
  \ not have been carrying any person other than its crew.  \nAlthough the Easy Rider\
  \  had been entered into the safe ship management system, it was \nnever going to\
  \ help the owner and skipper to run a safe fishing operation, because the owner\
  \ \ndid not understand the principles of safe ship management and the skipper did\
  \ not appear \nto show a willingness to comply with the rules.  \nThe owner of the\
  \ Easy Rider  was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe \noperation\
  \ of the vessel , as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules .\
  \   \nThe skipper did not hold the qualification required for him to be in charge\
  \ of the Easy Rider  \non the accident voyage.  \n \nReport 12 -201 \n<< Page 37\
  \ >>\n The skipper did not have the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if\
  \ he did , he did not \napply it wisely when loading the Easy Rider  for the trip.\
  \  The Easy Rider  being overloaded , \nwith the average distribution of weight\
  \ being too high , was the prime factor leading to its \ncapsize.  \nA historical\
  \ lack of common and good -standard practice for keeping ship operation and \nsafety\
  \ records has res ulted in the loss of important information about commercial vessels\
  \ \nthat are still operating today.  \nBecause commercial  vessels can frequently\
  \ change ownership and their owners can switch \nbetween safe ship management providers,\
  \ there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to \nmaintain a central database of all\
  \ important safety and operation records for the entire life \nof each vessel in\
  \ the system.    \n \n \n\n<< Page 38 >>\n Report 12 -201 5. Findings  \n5.1. The\
  \ Easy Rider  capsized when it was engulfed by what was probably a large breaking\
  \ wave, which \nreduced the vessel's stability by landing sea  water onto the fishing\
  \ deck, at the same time as \nrolling the vessel past the angle where it lost any\
  \ chance of recovery . \n5.2. The Easy  Rider  was loaded with too much weight,\
  \ too high up on deck, which left the boat with \ninsufficient reserve stability\
  \ for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff.  \n5.3. The weather conditions\
  \ were not suitable for the Easy Rider  to venture across Foveaux Strait at \nnight,\
  \ with marginal stability and with passengers on board.  \n5.4. The prearranged\
  \ rendezvous with the helicopter to coincide with unloading other vessels at Big\
  \ \nSouth Cape Island possibly influenced the skipper's decision to  continue with\
  \ his planned \ndeparture.  \n5.5. The Easy Rider  did not have sufficient life\
  \ -saving equipment for the 9 persons on board.  \n5.6. The Easy Rider 's manually\
  \ operated emergency position  indicating radio beacon had probably not \nbeen intentionally\
  \ activated and w as still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the\
  \ \nvessel sank.  \n5.7. Float -free emergency position  indicating radio beacon\
  \  and the enhancement of people carrying \npersonal locator beacon s will improve\
  \ the chances of being noticed and rescued, particul arly in \nthe event of a sudden\
  \ or catastrophic event such as a capsize.  \n5.8. It has not been possible to determine\
  \ how many,  if any , of the 8 persons who died survived the \ninitial capsize,\
  \ and if so for how long they survived.  \n5.9. There were as few as 4 approved\
  \ lifejacket s on board the Easy Rider  to be shared among 9 \npeople, which not\
  \ only contravened Maritime Rules  but significantly reduced the chances of \npersons\
  \ not wearing lifejacket s surviving in the water after the vessel capsized.  \n\
  5.10.  The Easy Rider 's life -raft wa s in current survey and was properly installed,\
  \ but was not able to \nfloat free to the surface because it became lodged between\
  \ the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as \nthe vessel was sinking.  Rated for 4 persons\
  \ only, the life -raft did not have sufficient capac ity to \ncater for the 9 persons\
  \ on board.  \n5.11.  The skipper's intention was for the Easy Rider  to operat\
  \ e as a commercial fishing vessel on the \naccident voyage , as he fully intended\
  \ to go fishing commercially once his passengers and their \nequipment had been\
  \ offl oaded.  \n5.12.  Neither the owner nor the skipper sought or was given a\
  \ dispensation by the safe ship \nmanagement company or the Director of Maritime\
  \ New Zealand to operate as a pleasure vessel \nfor the accident voyage, which meant\
  \  that the Easy Rider  was a commercia l fishing vessel and \nshould not have been\
  \ carrying any person other than its crew.  \n5.13.  Although the Easy Rider  had\
  \ been entered into the safe ship management system, it was never \ngoing to help\
  \ the owner and skipper to run a safe fishing operation, because the owner did not\
  \ \nunderstand the principles of safe ship management and the skipper did not appear\
  \ to show a \nwillingness to comply with the rules.  \n5.14.  The owner of the Easy\
  \ Rider  was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe operation \n\
  of the vessel, as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules.  \n\
  5.15.  The skipper did not hold the qualification required for him to be in charge\
  \ of the Easy Rider  on the \naccident  voyage.  \n5.16.  The skipper did not have\
  \ the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if he did , he did not apply it\
  \ \nwisely when loading the Easy Rider  for the trip.  The Easy Rider  being overloaded\
  \ , with the \naverage distribution of weight being too high . was th e prime factor\
