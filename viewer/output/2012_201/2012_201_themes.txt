The causes of the accident on the Easy Rider can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the vessel was heavily loaded with cargo, which affected its stability and buoyancy. Secondly, the skipper of the vessel did not hold the necessary qualification to be in command, which may have led to poor decision-making and navigation. Lastly, the weather conditions at the time of the accident were not ideal, with overcast skies and rain, increasing the risk of capsizing. These factors combined to create a dangerous situation that ultimately led to the accident.
