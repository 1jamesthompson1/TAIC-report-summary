2012_201,002/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand clarifies with industry the legal requirements around dual purpose use of vessels and the use of commercial vessels as pleasure craft, and ensures that safe ship management documents refer to the full requirements an owner must comply with before the vessel is used for another purpose.",
2012_201,003/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand addresses these 2 safety issues in any educational campaigns by making it clear that not all life jackets that can be purchased in New Zealand are approved and meet the requirements of New Zealand Maritime Rules, and that persons who have a large physique should purchase or be provided with a life jacket that is appropriate for their physique.","A number of the passengers and crew on the Easy Rider had a large physique. There were only 3 adult and one child lifejackets on board to share among 9 passengers and crew. The 3 adult lifejackets were not large enough to be securely fitted to those passengers and crew whom had a large physique. The Maritime Rules make provision for the carriage of childrenâ€™s lifejackets but are silent on the need for larger lifejackets to cater for people whom have a large physique. This is a safety issue.
Larger oversize approved life jackets are available in New Zealand, and at least one manufacturer will custom make a life jacket to suit.
Maritime Rules require that an approved life jacket be carried for every person on board every recreational and commercial vessel. While an approved life jacket is marked as complying with the appropriate standard, other life jackets are freely available for purchase that are not approved to the appropriate standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some other standard that is not accepted in New Zealand. An unwary purchaser, particularly a recreational boating person, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a life jacket approved to New Zealand standards. This is another safety issue.
"
2012_201,001/13,"The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand develops and maintains a system for centralising important operating and safety records for every commercial vessel in the New Zealand maritime system, including a policy on the retention and disposal of records that would best ensure records are kept for an appropriate period after a vessel leaves the system.","Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient information about the Easy Rider, a vessel that was still actively in the system. Maritime New Zealand was not able to find the older part of the ship file. Consequently the Commission had to rely on records from other vessels in order to make a reasonable assessment of the Easy Rider's stability.
When the Easy Rider was converted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo a simplified stability assessment, which it did, but the records sourced from the safe ship management company included only partial details of the inclining test and stability calculation that had been carried out. There was no record of the stability advice letter said to have been sent to the owner. Such a letter would normally include recommendations on the loading of the vessel.
Because commercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel in the system.
"
2012_201,020/12,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand trace the whereabouts of the remaining Owenga class fishing vessels and ensure that the appropriate stability calculations have been made for each vessel and alert the owners to any special stability characteristics they should be considering in the daily operation of their vessels.,"At about 2000 on 14 March 2012, the fishing vessel Easy Rider departed Bluff for Great South Cape Island off the west coast of Stewart Island.  The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Great South Island, where they were to prepare for the upcoming mutton-bird harvest.  The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.  The vessel was constructed of steel and was about 11 metres overall length with a beam of about 3.55 metres.  It was powered by a single diesel engine.  There was thought to have been 9 of its class built.  Four (including the Easy Rider) have been lost at sea over the years for differing reasons including one that was overwhelmed by a large wave, and 5 are thought to be still in use.  One of these 5 is currently being used for commercial fishing out of Bluff.

The Commission is in the process of firstly modelling the Easy Riderâ€™s 'light ship' stability from data obtained for other vessels of the Owenga class, and secondly estimating its actual stability on the accident voyage.

The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made preliminary calculations that support this view.

Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessels were built and with successive changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.
