- name: Vessel Stability and Loading
  explanation: Vessel stability and proper loading are critical safety themes in maritime operations. In the case of the Easy Rider, the vessel was "loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff" (5.2). The vessel's stability was compromised due to the extra load of cargo on deck and the passengers themselves, which raised the center of gravity and consequently reduced the stability reserve (4.3.7). This made the vessel "tender," meaning it would take only a small force or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel to take on an angle (4.3.8). The vessel's poor stability was a prime factor leading to its capsize when it was hit by a large breaking wave (5.16).
- name: Weather Conditions and Voyage Planning
  explanation: Weather conditions and voyage planning are essential safety themes in maritime operations. The Easy Rider embarked on its journey despite forecasts of unsuitable weather conditions, including high winds and significant wave heights (4.4.1). The vessel's decision to sail at night with "marginal stability and with passengers on board" was not prudent, especially given the forecasted weather (5.3). Other experienced fishermen had chosen to stay in port that night, indicating that the skipper's decision to depart was influenced by a pre-arranged rendezvous rather than safety considerations (4.4.2).
- name: Safety Equipment and Emergency Preparedness
  explanation: Safety equipment and emergency preparedness are vital for survival in the event of a maritime accident. The Easy Rider was found to be lacking in life-saving equipment, as there were "as few as 4 approved lifejackets on board the Easy Rider to be shared among 9 people" (5.9). Additionally, the vessel's life-raft, designed for only 4 people, was not able to float free during the sinking (5.10). The manually operated emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) had not been intentionally activated and was still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the vessel sank (5.6). These factors significantly reduced the chances of survival for those on board.
- name: Qualifications and Training of Crew
  explanation: The qualifications and training of the crew are crucial for the safe operation of a vessel. In the case of the Easy Rider, the skipper did not hold the required qualification to be in charge of the vessel on the accident voyage (5.15). The skipper also lacked the requisite knowledge of ship stability, which is fundamental for any commercial operator (5.16). This lack of qualifications and training contributed to the skipper's inability to recognize the warning signs of poor stability and to load the vessel appropriately, leading to the vessel's capsize.
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safe Ship Management
  explanation: Regulatory compliance and adherence to safe ship management practices are essential for ensuring the safety of maritime operations. The Easy Rider had entered the safe ship management system but was not operated in compliance with the rules, as the owner did not understand the principles of safe ship management, and the skipper did not show a willingness to comply (5.13). The owner was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe operation of the vessel as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules (5.14). The vessel was also operating without a valid safety compliance inspection (4.6.22).
- name: Record-Keeping and Information Management
  explanation: Proper record-keeping and information management are important for maintaining the safety and operational history of vessels. In the investigation of the Easy Rider accident, there was difficulty accessing sufficient information about the vessel due to historical issues with keeping ship operation and safety records (5.16). The loss of important records can hinder the ability to assess a vessel's stability and safety characteristics, as was the case with the Easy Rider, where the stability assessment booklet was lost or not handed on to another owner (4.6.2). A central database of all important safety and operation records is recommended to avoid such issues in the future (5.16).
