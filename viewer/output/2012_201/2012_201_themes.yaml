- name: Vessel Stability and Loading
  explanation: Vessel stability and proper loading are critical for the safety of maritime operations. In the case of the Easy Rider, the vessel was "loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff" (5.2). The vessel's stability was compromised due to the extra load of cargo on deck and the passengers themselves, which raised the center of gravity and consequently reduced the stability reserve (4.3.7). This made the vessel "tender," meaning it would take only a small force or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel to take on an angle (4.3.8). The vessel's poor stability was a prime factor leading to its capsize when it was hit by a large breaking wave (5.16).
- name: Weather Conditions and Voyage Planning
  explanation: Weather conditions and proper voyage planning are essential for ensuring the safety of maritime travel. The Easy Rider embarked on its journey despite forecasts of unsuitable weather conditions, including high winds and significant wave heights (4.4.1). The vessel ventured across Foveaux Strait at night with "marginal stability and with passengers on board," which was not suitable given the weather conditions (5.3). The skipper's decision to proceed with the voyage was influenced by a pre-arranged rendezvous with a helicopter, which may have pressured the decision to sail despite the weather (5.4).
- name: Safety Equipment and Emergency Preparedness
  explanation: The availability and proper use of safety equipment and emergency preparedness are vital for survival in the event of a maritime accident. The Easy Rider did not have sufficient life-saving equipment for the nine persons on board, and the life-raft was not able to float free to the surface because it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as the vessel was sinking (5.10). Additionally, the vessel's manually operated emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) had probably not been intentionally activated and was found still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the vessel sank (5.6). The lack of adequate life-saving equipment and the failure to activate the EPIRB significantly reduced the chances of survival for those on board.
- name: Qualifications and Training of Crew
  explanation: The qualifications and training of the crew are crucial for the safe operation of a vessel. In this incident, the skipper of the Easy Rider did not hold the qualification required to be in charge of the vessel on the accident voyage (5.15). The skipper also lacked the requisite knowledge of ship stability, which is fundamental for any commercial operator and is covered in the qualifications he was required but failed to have (5.16). This lack of proper qualifications and training contributed to the skipper's inability to recognize the vessel's compromised stability and the risks associated with the voyage.
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safe Ship Management
  explanation: Compliance with maritime regulations and adherence to safe ship management practices are essential for the safety of maritime operations. The Easy Rider was not operated in compliance with safe ship management obligations, as the owner did not understand the principles of safe ship management, and the skipper did not show a willingness to comply with the rules (5.13). The vessel was operating as a commercial fishing vessel without the necessary dispensation to operate as a pleasure vessel for the accident voyage, and it should not have been carrying any person other than its crew (5.12). The failure to comply with regulatory requirements and safe ship management practices was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Record-Keeping and Information Management
  explanation: Proper record-keeping and information management are important for maintaining the safety of vessels over time. In the case of the Easy Rider, there was difficulty accessing sufficient information about the vessel due to historical issues with record-keeping standards (5.16). The lack of a central database for important safety and operation records for vessels in the system can lead to the loss of critical information that could inform safety practices and prevent future accidents (5.14). The absence of accurate and complete records on the Easy Rider's modifications and stability assessments hindered the ability to fully understand and address the vessel's stability issues.
