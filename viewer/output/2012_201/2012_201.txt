The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determ ine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investiga tion nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter  for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission and this report  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investiga tion organisations overseas.  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that ca n be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

Report 12 -201 
<< Page 1 >>
 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 2000 on 14 March 2012, the fishing vessel Easy Rider  departed Bluff for Big South 
Cape Island off the west coast of Stewart Island.  The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 
passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Big So uth Cape Island, 
where they were to prepare for the upcoming muttonbird  harvest.  The skipper intended then to 
travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.   
1.2. The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was 
forecast to deteriorate further as a frontal weather system passed across the Foveaux Strait 
area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 -50 knots from the northwest before 
easing to 15 knots from the southwest after the weather fr ont had passed.   
1.3. During 14 March the skipper loaded  the Easy Rider  with ice and bait in the fish hold and 
loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then 
loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the "muttonbird ers".  The stores and 
equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places were  stacked as high as the roof 
of the wheelhouse.   
1.4. At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider  was somewhere in the area of the Bishop and 
Clerks Islands at the western end of Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong , variable 
currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider  was engulfed by a large wave in this area and 
capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew 
mem ber, who had been  sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the 
deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  Four  bodies were recovered and 4 
are still missing , declared drowned.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) made findings  that t he Easy 
Rider  was loaded with too much weight , too high in the vessel , resulting in it having insufficient 
reserve stability for the intended voyage.  The skipper did not have the required maritime 
qualification to be in charge of the Easy Rider  when it was operating as a commercial fishing 
vessel, and he did not have a sound knowledge of his vessel's stability.  
1.6. The skipper intended to go fishing after dropping off his passengers and their equipment.  
Therefore, t he Easy Rider  was operating as a commercial fishing vessel and should not have 
been carrying the 6 passengers  and their equipment on the accident trip to the Titi Islands .   
1.7. There was not sufficient life-saving equipment for the number of people on board, including as 
few as 4 approved lifejackets to share between 9 persons . 
1.8. In the early years , when the "Owenga " class vessels were built , surveyors realised that the 
vessels had limited reserves of stability. This information appears to have been lost over time 
with successive changes in ownership and with changes in maritime administration.  The 
Commission made recommendations  to the Direc tor of Maritime New Zealand to alert owners 
of existing vessels built to the "Owenga " design of these stability issues, and that he address 
issues around the retention and disposal of important maritime records.  
1.9. Key lessons  learnt from this accident includ e: 
 skippers and persons in charge of vessels  must have at least a basic understanding of 
ship stability and how  the loading of people and equipment can affect this stability  
 navigating small craft in rough sea conditions at night is an inherently dangerous  
activity and should be avoided if and when possible  
 the life-saving equipment on a vessel of any description being used for any purpose 
must be suitable for the intended trip and for the number and size of persons on board  
 Maritime Rules specify the bare minimum requirements for life -saving equipment.  
Operators should consider purchasing a higher standard of equipment that can improve 
the chances of detection and rescue in the event of a mishap

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 15 March 2012 at about 1800 , the Commission  learned through the me dia that an 
accident involving  a fishing vessel , the Easy Rider , had occurred earlier that day . 
2.2. The Commission immediately opened an inquiry into the occurrence under section 13(1) of the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed a n investigator  in 
charge.   
2.3. Two investigators and the Commission's communications manager travelled to Invercargill on 
16 March 2012, and in the following 5 days the Commission's investigators met with senior 
officers from the New Zealand Police, the Coroner's office and Maritime New Zealand.  The 
investigators also received briefings on the search and rescue effort.  Once the wreck had been 
located the investigators worked with  the Royal New Zealand Navy dive team  and the New 
Zealand Police dive team to obtain underwater footage of the wreck.   
2.4. The investigators also interviewed the sole survivor , and other persons who had seen  the Easy 
Rider  depart from Bluff.    
2.5. Information was sourced from Maritime New Zealand, the vessel's owner, the vessel's safe 
ship management provider, naval architects and other maritime industry persons.   
2.6. The investigators returned to Invercargill on 2 April 2012 to meet with the families  of the 
victims and to carry out further interviews and investigation s.   
2.7. The Commission estimated a virtual stability model of the Easy Rider  by using data supplied 
from various sources , in particular using data provided by another naval architect who had 
measured the hull of a sister vessel and made a stability assessment of that vessel.  
2.8. An in dependent expert naval architect was used to verify the stability report  that the 
Commission produced.  
2.9. On 7 May 2012 the Commission published an urgent safety recommendation that it had made 
to the Director of Maritime New Zealand concerning limitations t o the stability of "Owenga" 
class fishing vessels , of which the Easy Rider  was one . 
2.10.  The Coroner -authorised autopsy reports for the 4 bodies that were recovered were obtained 
and used to comment on survival aspects, including the toxicology results . 
2.11.  On 18 September 2012  Commissioners approved  a draft final report regarding the accident 
and agreed that it could be circulated to 18 people , for comment.  Many of the se people  were 
families of the victims .  Before releasing this draft final report, the Commissio n telephoned 
these families to inform them of the impending release and to explain how they could 
participate in the Commission's consultation process.  The Commission also informed them 
that the  closing date  for receiving submissions was  19 October 2012.    
2.12.  On 16 October 2012 the Commission extended this closing date until 15 November 2012 in 
response to a request from the interested person defined in paragraph 2.15.  In the next few 
days the Commission contacted the families of the victims, or left messag es, informing them of 
this new date and asking them to contact the Commission if they had questions about its draft 
final report or the process for preparing a submission.  
2.13.  In November 2012 the Commission invited the families to meet with Commission staff in 
Invercargill so that the Commission could explain the technical aspects of its draft final report 
and the Commission's consultation process.  This meeting occurred on the  evening of 28 
November 2012.   
2.14.  Following that meeting the Commission extended the date for receiving submissions 3 more 
times  (i.e. 23 January 2013, 30 January 2013 and 31 January 2013)  in response to requests 
from the interested person.  
 

<< Page 4 >>
 Report 12 -201 2.15.  By the closing date the Commission had received submissions from 3 people  - one from t he 
sole survivor (dated  29 January 2013 ), 2 from  Maritime New Zealand (dated 11 October 2012 
and 31 January 2013)  and several submissions from an interested person (i.e. a preliminary 
submission received on 8 February 2013 , 2 appendices received on 11 February  2013 , a 
further submission and exhibits received on  4 March 2013, an addendum received on 6 March 
2013, a further document received on  7 March 2013  and a final adden dum with supporting 
documents received on 18 March 2013 ).  Although this person  appeared to be acting in a 
personal capacity when making these  submission s, she was also the sole director of AZ1 
Enterprises Limited (the company that owned and operated the Easy Rider ), a shareholder of 
that company and the partner of the skipper (for ease of reference , this person is referred to as 
the "interested person"  throughout the report ). 
2.16.  On 5 March 2013 the interested person made a verbal submission to Commissioners in 
Wellington.  
2.17.  The Commission has considered all submissions and any changes as a result of those 
submissions have been included in this final report.  
2.18.  The report was approved for publication by the Commission on 20 March 2013.

3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  The skipper of the Easy Rider  had agreed to transport 2 members of his extended family along 
with their  cargo to Big South Cape Island , one of the Titi (Muttonbird Islands),  (see Figure 1) 
for 15 March so that they could prepare for the start of the muttonbird ing season.   
3.1.2.  The skipper  of the Easy Rider  had arranged for the vessel to be lifted out of the water  at Bluff 
on Monday 12 March 2012 .  He intended to clean the underwater portion of the hull , apply 
some anti -fouling paint and have some minor repairs done to the vessel's propulsi on and 
steering systems .   
3.1.3.  On Tuesday 13 March the skipper was still working on the vessel .  A maritime safety inspector 
from Maritime New Zealand stopped on his way to audit another vessel nearby , to arrange an 
appointment for him to carry out a safe ship management compliance inspection of the Easy 
Rider .  The maritime safety inspector said that they agreed for him to return after lunch the 
next day (Wednesday 14 M arch), when  the ve ssel would be back in the water .  The work on 
the Easy Rider  was completed that same afternoon and the vessel was re-floated  at about 
1500 .   
3.1.4.  During the morning of Wednesday 14 M arch the skipper was busy on board his vessel, 
collecting equipment that he had taken off the vessel when it was lifted out of the water.  At 
about 1100 h e moved  the Easy Rider  to the end of the fish wharf , where he  loaded 
approximately 2.1 tonnes of ice and about 360 kilograms of bait.  Both these commodities 
were stowed in the vessel's fish hold.   
3.1.5.  At about 1300 the maritime saf ety inspector arrived at the Easy Rider , which by then was tied 
up to the Fisherman's Company Wharf  to the east of the ferry terminal .  The skipper told him 
that he was not ready and asked him to come  back in an hour .  The maritime safety inspector 
left the vessel and returned at about 1400.   
3.1.6.  The inspector started the survey but it soon became apparent  that the Easy Rider  had not 
been adequately prepared.  He had another vessel to inspect , so he agreed with the skipper t o 
return to the Easy Rider  on Friday , 2 days later .   
3.1.7.  While the inspector was still on the vessel a truck arrived with stores and materials belonging 
to the extended family members.  After the inspector left the vessel the skipper ran an errand 
then return ed to the vessel.  The skipper, the truck driver and one other then took the Easy 
Rider  out into the harbour and retrieved the skipper's cod pots  from where they had been  
stored on the sea bed.  On their return the y loaded the stores  and materials on board the Easy 
Rider  from the truck .   
3.1.8.  An observer on the opposite quay noted that as the equipment and stores were loaded the 
vessel sat lower in the water towards the stern.  Towards the end of the loading a quantity of 
wood was lifted from the truck and lowered , by crane , to one side of the vessel.  However, the 
vessel listed heavily to that side , so the wood was lifted clear then lowered to sit transversely 
across the vessel at the stern (see Figure 2).   
3.1.9.  As the afternoon progressed , more members of the skipper's extended family arrived at the 
vessel and more equipment and personal effects were loaded on board.  At about 1930 two 
crew members arrived on board .  The skipper and crew filled the fuel tanks from the pump on 
the wharf and fi lled the fresh water barrel , which was on deck .   
3.1.10.  The 2 crew members then checked all the lashings on the equipment, materials and cargo on 
the after -deck (see Figure 2), which was so tightly packed that the crew members could only 
access the sides of the stow by standing on the bulwark rail .  The passengers then boarded 
the vessel.  Some of the extended family members who had not been scheduled to go to the 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 7 >>
 Titi Islands decided there and then to journey to the Islands on the Easy Rider , and the skipper 
allowed them  to board.  
3.1.11.  At about 2000 the Easy Rider  departed .  On board were the skipper, 2 crew members and 6 
passengers .  As the vessel manoeuvred away from the wharf , an observer on the opposite 
quay noted that the sea water w as sloshing  onto  the after -deck and draining out of the aft-
most freeing ports2.   
3.1.12.  As t he Easy Rider  was transiting the entrance channel the skipper  contacted Bluff 
Fisherman's Radio and gave  a trip report.  He continued to steer  the vessel through the Bluff 
entrance channel and out into Foveaux Strait,  where  he then turned the vessel in a generally 
weste rly direction  (see Figure 3) .   
3.1.13.  One crew member, t he survivor , was sitting  outside the wheelhouse with his back against 
some  blue barrels  (see Figure 2) .  Two of the passengers  sat in the space between the 
wheelhouse and the cargo  as both were suffering from  the effects of motion sickness.   The 
crew member  had given the se 2 passengers  his and the other crew member's lifejackets.  The 
skipper was standing in the wheelhouse behind the steering wheel.  One passenger  was 
sitting in the  entranceway to the forecastle cabin and one passenger  was sitting on the couch 
on the port side of the wheelhouse , with his son sitting on his lap.  One passenger  and the 
other crew member were asleep in the forecastle cabin.   
3.1.14.  The crew member on deck  saw that the youngest passenger  was looking cold , so he found a 
child's lifejacket that had come on board with  the cargo  and put it on him.   
3.1.15.  The surviving crew member said that he had just been listening to the radio news at 2400 
(midnight ).  Shortly after  he heard the sound of a larger wave.  The wave came over the 
starboard side of the vessel, the deck filled with water and he was washed to the port side of 
the vessel.  The vessel then heeled sharply to port  and the crew member  was tipped into the 
sea.  He managed to grab a rope and was swept to the stern of the vessel.

 3.1.16.  As the crew member was swept to the stern of the vessel he felt the vessel capsize .  He 
managed to pull himself up onto the inverted hull and wedged himself into a space at the 
stern by the rudder.  He then started hammering on the hull , but got no answer.  After what he 
estimated to be 2 hours he heard what he described as a "whoosh" from the forward end of 
the vessel; the Easy Rider  then heeled to starboard and started to sink by the stern.   
3.1.17.  The crew membe r crawled up the hull to the bow before having to step off into the water . As 
he kicked away from the vessel a fuel canister popped up beside him, which he then used to 
help support himself in the water.  He was not wearing a lifejacket.   
3.2. Search and rescu e 
3.2.1.  The helicopter that was to offload the cargo  for the Easy Rider 's passengers  had arranged to 
be at Big South Cape Island at about midday on Thursday 15 March.  The helicopter had also 
arranged to offload cargo from 3  other vessels at Big South Cape Island and one vessel at Tia 
Island on the east coast of Stewart Island.   
3.2.2.  The helicopter pilot lifted the cargo off 3 vessels  at Big South Cape Island .  The Easy Rider  had 
not arrived and the helicopter pilot could not contact or find the Easy  Rider , so he flew to Tia 
Island and offloaded cargo from a vessel there.  On his way back to Big South Cape Island 
from Tia Island he was still unable to contact the Easy Rider , so he radioed his base to contact 
the skipper's partner to find out if the Easy Rider  had departed as expected.  The pilot also 
contacted Stewart Island Fisherman's Radio, but the operator  had not heard from the Easy 
Rider . 
3.2.3.  The skipper of one of the other vessels at Big South Cape Island informed the helicopter pilot 
that the Easy Rider  had been having alternator problems and the vessel may be in one o f the 
coves with a flat battery.  H e told the helicopter pilot that he was checking the inlets on Big 
South Cape Island  for the Easy Rider .  At about 1500  the helicopter pilot was info rmed that 
the vessel had left at about 2000 the previous night .   
3.2.4.  At about 1525 Bluff Fisherman's Radio informed t he Police of the overdue  vessel and a 
search was organised.  The helicopter pilot was requested to search the coast of Big South 
Cape Is land, after which he landed on the Island  to refuel before commencing a coastline 
search along the west coast of Stewart Isla nd northwards from Doughboy Bay  (see Figure 1).   
3.2.5.  At about 1704 , as the helicopter pilot entered Foveaux Strait , he noticed a patch of smooth 
water, which as he flew over he saw was caused by an oil slick.  The pilot fixed the position  by 
global positioning system  and radioed this find to the Police search and rescue team.  He did 
not notice any flotsam in the vicinity of the oil slick .   
3.2.6.  The Police search and rescue co -ordinator arranged for land, air and sea units to take part in a 
search.  At about 18 10 one of the sea units, the Royal New Zealand Coastguard vessel 
stationed in Bluff, was proceeding to the area of the accident when a look out saw the fuel 
canister being thrown into the air by the survivor .  The Coastguard vessel manoeuvred 
alongside and the survivor was rescued (see Figure 3) .  The first body was found at about 
2030. 
3.2.7.  On Friday 16 March the wreck of the Easy Rider  was identified on the sea bed at about 0930 . 
The wreck at the time was lying on its side in approximately 40 metres of water.  B odies 2 and 
3 were found at about 1 245 that same  afternoon and body 4 was found at about 1 530.   
3.2.8.  The Royal New Zealand Nav y ship Resolution  had been assisting in the search .  On Friday 
evening members of the Royal New Zealand Navy dive team and members of the New Zealand 
Police dive team  boarded the vessel to go to the wreck site .  On Saturday 17 March the dive 
teams were able to dive on the wreck , which by this time had assumed an upright position .  
They carried out a search but did not find any of the 4 missing persons .   
3.2.9.  The dive teams took a video recording of  their inspection of the vessel.  The video showed that 
the life -raft had moved  from its stowage position on top of the wheelhouse and was wedged 
 

<< Page 10 >>
 Report 12 -201 between the port -side rail and the wheelhouse bulkhead.  The emergency position indicating 
radio beacon was still in its stowage position , inside the wheelhouse,  and was opera ting.   
3.2.10.  When the search was called off by the incident commander, one crew member had been 
recovered alive and the bodies of one crew member and 3 passengers had been  recovered.  
The bodies of the skipper and 3 other passengers , including the child , were s till missing.   
3.3. Climatic and environmental conditions  
For a full description of the weather conditions off the north coast of Stewart Island in Foveaux 
Strait , see Appendix 1 .   
3.3.1.  The weather when the vessel departed was overcast and it was raining. T he wind was blowing 
from the north west at about 15 -20 knots.  The tide was just starting to ebb , with high tide 
occurring at 2002.   
3.3.2.  The accident happened in the "Foveaux " coastal waters forecast area.  The next forecast area 
to the west was "Puysegur " and the Easy Rider  was heading into this area .  The Meteorological 
Service of New Zealand Limited (MetService) issued coastal waters forecasts at regular times.  
The coastal waters forecasts were valid within 60 nautical miles of the New Zealand coastline 
and described in a general sense the weather conditions expected.  However, MetService  
stated a caveat that over small parts of the forecast area, for example off a particular  
headland or in a sheltered bay , weather conditions could be significantly different  from those 
forecast.   
3.3.3.  The coastal waters forecast issued at 1606 N ew Zealand Daylight Time on 14 March 2012 for

3.3.7.  The moon was showing about one -quarter and would have risen at about 2337 on 14 March 
and set at about 1434 on 15 March.   
3.4. Vessel information  
3.4.1.  The Easy Rider  was classed as a restricted limit fishing vessel.  As far as can be determined it 
was probably  built in Auckland in 197 0 by Dillingham of Dillingham Transportation (N.Z.) 
Limited, Auckland , which took over the Scholten and Brijs shipbuilding yard in 1969.   
3.4.2.  The Easy Rider  was built to the same Breekveldt design as the "Owenga" class of fishing 
vessels constructed  from the late 1960s  onward for the Chatham Islands ' cray-fishing boom.  
The vessel's hull was constructed from steel and had an overall length of 11 metres, a 
breadth of 3.76 metres and a moulded depth of 1.82 metres.  The gross tonnage was 9.3 
tons.  
3.4.3.  The Easy Rider  was powered by a 4 -cylinder in -line Caterpillar D330 diesel engine that 
produced 120 horsepower (89.48 kilowatts  [kW] ) driving a single fixed -pitch propeller through 
a twin-disc MG 560 reduction gearbox that gave a service speed of abo ut 8 knots.   
3.4.4.  The Easy Rider  was fitted with the following navigational and communication equipment at the 
time of its survey for entry into the safe ship management system :  
 a Solara digital selective calling  very-high-frequency radio transmitter receiver  
 a Furuno GD 1000 global positioning system receiver and video plotter  
 a Coursemaster CM 450 automatic pilot  
 a JRC 2000 radar  
 a Sestrel magnetic compass  
 a Furuno depth sounder  
 a GME Accusat emergency positioning indicating radio beacon  
The interested person  said that the skipper had probably also had a handheld very high 
frequency radio transmitter receiver with him.    
3.4.5.  Since being built the Easy Rider  had been used both commercially and privately.  When built it 
was given a fishing number, AK98 , applic able to the Auckland region.  It had then been used 
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Report 12 -201 on the west coast of  the South Island.  By 2007 it was operating out of Dunedin as a private 
vessel  and as such was not within the safe ship management system .   
3.4.6.  In June 2008 the then owner presented the vessel for survey to re-enter safe ship 
management .  The surveyor informed the then owner that due to the extensive nature of the 
repairs required to bring the vessel into survey, the vessel was in effect a constructive total 
loss.  The surveyor also noted  to Maritime New Zealand that if an attempt were  made to bring 
the vessel into survey a full investigation would need  to be made as to the vessel's condition.   
3.4.7.  In March 2011 AZ1 Enterprises Limited acquired the vessel and moved it to Bluff .   
3.4.8.  The owner then carried out s ubstantial repair work on the vessel  in Bluff .  This repair work was 
overseen by a surveyor on behalf of Maritime Management Services,  a safe ship management 
company.  The surveyor issued a fit -for-purpose certificate for the Easy Rider  with certain 
defined i nshore and enclosed  limits (see "Data summary ").   
3.4.9.  Maritime Rules Part 21, Safe Ship Management Systems came into force in 1997.  The safe 
ship management system was based on the established International Safety Management 
System, but was modified for domestic commercial ships.  Part 21 was supported by , and 
included , New Zealand Safe Ship Management Code, which outlined how an SSM system 
should be implemented.   
3.4.10.  The inspection regime  under safe ship management was a combination of surv eys and audits.  
These were intended to assess the condition of ship s and the adherence to safety 
management system s by owner s, operator s and crew s.   
3.4.11.  On 6 September 2011 Maritime New Zealand issued a safe ship management certificate for 
the Easy Rider  to AZ1 Enterprises L imited .  The certificate named AZ1 Enterprises Limited as 
the owner of the Easy Rider .  The certificate had a compliance date of 6 March 2012 and was 
valid until 14 August 2012, when the vessel was due for an inspection of the propeller shaft.  
A safety inspection was to be carried out by Maritime New Zealand prior to the compliance 
date; and  it was this inspection that the Maritime New Zealand safety inspector was trying to 
complete on 14 March 2012.   
3.4.12.  The safe ship management certificate stated that the vessel was not to proceed beyond its 
operating limits, which were the same as those conta ined in the fit -for-purpose certificate.  
Within the designated limits it was fit to ply as a fishing vessel.  Life -saving appliances were 
provided for 3 persons and the vessel was not to carry passengers.   
3.4.13.  
<< Page 2 >>
 of the Easy Rider  safety management polic y and operations manual stated  that the 
minimum manning requirements for the vessel in both the enclosed and inshore limits was to 
be one master holding a New Zealand Inshore Launch Master's certificate of competency .   
3.4.14.  Section 7.1 , Operating Parameters of  the safety management policy and operations manual 
stated:  
The business has put in place the following operating parameters for this 
vessel.  
 Vessel may be used for recreational purposes by the owner or the 
owner's representatives, with no fare paying passengers on board.  
MMS [Maritime Management Services] must be advised  
 Vessel operation is at the discretion of the Master subject to safe sea 
and weather conditions.  
3.5. Stability  and loading  
3.5.1.  For a description of the basic principles of statical stability , see Appendix 3.  For a more 
detailed discussion of the hydrostatic model used to determine the stability of the Easy Rider  
from the data available to the Commission , see Appendix 4.   
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 13 >>
 3.5.2.  The lightship weight  of the  Easy Rider  was the weight of the vessel when complete and ready 
for service but empty.  To the lightship weight was added the deadweight, which was the 
weight in tonn es that the vessel could  carry when loaded to the maximum permissible 
draught .  The deadweight  include d fuel, fresh water, gear , supplies, catch and crew.  The 
displacement mass was the total weight of the vessel; t he lightship weight plus the 
deadweight.    
3.5.3.  When the Easy Rider  left Bluff it was loaded with a deadweight  for the forthcoming voyage 
estimated to be at least 9.884 tonnes (see Appendix 4 for details  of how these weights were 
derived ). The following table shows what contributed to the estimated deadweight : 
Description  Weight (tonnes)  
Fuel 2.800   
Fresh water  0.200   
Cargo and equipment  3.294   
Vessel's stores including victualing  0.200   
Ice 2.100   
Bait 0.360   
Crew  and passengers  0.930   
Deadweight  9.884   
Light ship weight  17.531   
Displacement  27.415   
Table 2   
Easy Rider 's estimated deadweight  on departure 14 March 2012  
When embarking  on a "normal" fishing voyage the Easy Rider  would typically  have  had 7 
tonnes of deadweight on departure.  The following table shows how that deadweight could 
have been made up : 
Description  Weight (tonnes)  
Fuel 2.800   
Fresh water  0.200   
Cod and cray pots  1.000   
Vessel's stores including victualing  0.200   
Ice 2.100   
Bait 0.360   
Crew  0.341   
Deadweight  7.001   
Light ship weight  17.531   
Displacement  24.532

3.6. Survivability  
3.6.1.  The Easy Rider  was fitted with a n RFD Pacific -4 life-raft (4 persons) , which had been 
purchased from RFD in Christchurch  in August 2011 .  The Pacific -4 life -raft had been  
manufactured for RFD by Plastimo , a French company.  The Pacific -4 life -raft had been type 
approved in New Zealand by the Ministry of Transport in 1991.  The maritime safety inspector 
checked the life -raft before discontinuing his survey on the day the Easy Rider  departed Bluff.  
He note d that it was in survey and that its next annual service was due in August 2012 .  He 
also noted that it was correctly installed and secured.   
3.6.2.  The life -raft was secured in its cradle by a hydrostatic release unit.  Th ese units were designed 
to operate  at a pre-set depth to release  a life -raft so that it could  float to the surface .  The type 
of hydrostatic release unit fitted to the life -raft on board the Easy Rider  was a Hammar H2O 
HRU, which was designed and certified to operate at a depth of between 1.5 m etres  and 4 
metres .  It was a non -serviceable item that was required to be replaced every 2 years.  This 
type of HRU had been in production since 1986 and was certified and approved by many 
 

<< Page 14 >>
 Report 12 -201 classification societies and maritime administrations around the w orld.  The Maritime Safety 
Authority had  issued a certificate of acceptance for the HRU on 5 March 2002.   
3.6.3.  The hydrostatic release unit used  a water -pressure mechanism  to activate a spring -operated 
blade.  The blade severed a loop of line through which the life -raft securing lanyards were 
fastened.  The installation instructions that accompanied each HRU explained that a slip -hook 
or similar should be used to allow easy manual deployment of the life -raft.  It is unkno wn if 
such  a quic k-release device was fitted to the Easy Rider 's life-raft securing system.  
3.6.4.  The Easy Rider  was equipped with 3  type-approved lifejacket s.  The interested person 
submitted  that, in addition to the 3 type -approved lifejackets , there were possibly 2 or 3 other 
lifejackets of indeterminate age and condition on board.  The child's lifejacket that was 
brought on board was put on the child by a crew member .  The crew member did this because 
the child was cold , but he could not recal l if he had fastened it correctly.  No lifejackets were 
recovered during the search and rescue operation.   
3.6.5.  The Easy Rider  was fitted with a GME Accusat MT 406G emergency positioning indicating 
radio beacon.  This beacon operated on the 406 megahertz frequ ency and included a global 
positioning receiver and a 121.5 megahertz homing transmitter.  That model of beacon did 
not automatically operate or float free.  It had to be removed from its bracket and switched on  
manually .  Once removed from its stowage pos ition the beacon was buoyant and could be 
attached to a person or life -raft with the supplied buoyant line.  The beacon had an internal 
global positioning receiver and once activated the beacon transmi tted a message that 
included a global positioning syste m derived position to about 100 metres accuracy.  If the 
beacon were  above water , satellites would  pick up this message and relay it to Rescue 
Coordination Centre  New Zealand .   
3.6.6.  Providing the beacon had been registered, which the Easy Rider 's had, the Rescue 
Coordination Centre would then know from its database the vessel  to which  the beacon 
belonged and the contact numbers for the owners.   
3.6.7.  When the Maritime New Zealand safety inspector started his audit on the day that the vessel 
sailed fr om Bluff , he noted on his check sheet that the vessel was equipped with 4 hand 
distress flares and 2 distress smoke canisters; all were in date.   
3.7. Personnel  
3.7.1.  The skipper had spent most of his adult life, and a part of his childhood, on fishing vessels .  
The interested person  said that the skipper had spent about 30 years fishing as a deckhand , 
but that the Easy Rider  was his first vessel as skipper.   
3.7.2.  The skipper held a New Zealand certificate of competency as a qualified fishing deckhand.  He 
also held a c ertificate as a radio operator.   He did not have the certificate of competency that 
Maritime Rules required to operate the Easy Rider  commercially.   
3.7.3.  Under Maritime Rules Part 31C , Crewing and Watchkeeping Fishing Vessels (see Appendix 2), 
the manning of the Easy Rider  had to be sufficient for the safe operation of the vessel.  The 
minimum crew was derived from the applicable tables and flow charts after carrying out a 
minimum safe crewing assessment.  Maritime Rules 31C also contained a li st of acceptable 
equivalents for the required certificates of competency .   
3.7.4.  The manning for operation in the inshore area was set at one inshore launch master 
certificate of competency.  Suitable equivalent certificates of competency were listed, with 
cond itions, as a New Zealand offshore watch -keeper, inshore fishing skipper, master 
restricted limit launch or commercial launch master . 
3.7.5.  Both of the deckhands  had spent several years in the fishing industry , but neither held  any 
maritime qualification.  
3.7.6.  The 6 passengers  were all members of the same extended family , ranging in age between 7 
years and 58 years .  None of the passengers  held any maritime qualification.

3.8. Toxicology  
3.8.1.  A post -mortem examination was carried out on the 4 bodies recovered , including  routine 
toxicology reports.  The toxicology reports revealed that:  
 the crew member had a level of tetrahydroc annabinol C21H30O2 (THC)3 of 7 
micrograms per litre in the blood .  No alcohol was detected  
 one passenger had no traces of performance -impairing substances  
 one passenger had a level of THC of 1.6 micrograms per litre in the blood .  No alcohol 
was detected  
 one passenger  had a blood alcohol level of 125 milligrams  per 100 millilitres4 and a 
trace of THC in the blood .

 Report 12 -201 Fisheries Act 1996  
3.9.4.  Section 103 of the Fisheries A ct states that : 
(1)  No person shall use a fishing vessel, or any tender of that fishing vessel, to take 
fish, aquatic life, or seaweed for sale, in New Z ealand fisheries waters, unless:  
(a)  the vessel is registered in the Fishing Vessel Register as a fishing vessel; 
and 
(b)  that person is named in that register as an operator of, or a notified user in 
relation to, that vessel; and  
(c)  that person complies with all conditions of registration (if any) and any 
conditions of any consent of the chief executive given under subsection (4).   
3.9.5.  Section 111 of the Fisheries Act states that:  
(1)  For the purposes of this Act, all fish, aquatic life, or seaweed that is on board, or 
landed from, or transhipped from, any fishing vessel or fish carrier registered under 
this Act is deemed to have  been taken or possessed for the purpose of sale, unless : 
(a)  the taking or possession of the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed was in 
accordance with a general or particular approval of the chief executive 
and with any conditions imposed on that approval; a nd 
(b)  the taking or possession occurred after that approval was given.  
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed were lawfully taken 
under regulations made under section 186.  
Stability and construction  
3.9.6.  Maritime Rules Part 40D, Design, Construction and Equipment - Fishing Ships came into 
force on 1 February 2000.  Part 40D applied to almost every New Zealand ship that was 
required to be registered under section 57 of the Fisheries Act 1983, or section 103 of the 
Fisheries Ac t 1996, or recognised by the Director as bein g engaged in fisheries research .  Part 
40D prescribed the standards of design and construction of fishing ships, and the equipment 
they were required to carry.   
3.9.7.  Sections 40D. 34 and 40D. 35 required fishing vesse ls of less than 24 m in length and 
engaged in trawling, dredging or similar forms of fishing where heavy gear was towed, or 
engaged in purse seining, to undergo stability tests and freeboard assignation that had not 
been required for such ships previously.    
3.9.8.  Intact stability for a vessel was required for 5 typical loading conditions :  
(i)    departure for the fishing grounds with full fuel, stores, ice and fishing gear  
(ii)   departure from the fishing grounds with full catch  
(iii)  arrival at home port wit h full catch and 10% fuel and stores  
(iv)  arrival at home port with 10% fuel, stores and a minimum catch, that is normally to be 
20% of a full catch but may be up to 40%, provided the surveyor is satisfied that 
operating patterns justify such a value  
(v)   any other actual operating conditions the surveyor considers would produce the lowest 
values of the parameters contained in the criteria required by sub -rule (4)(c) . 
The intact stability for a vessel was considered satisfactory if certain conditions  were  met in  
each of the loading conditions.   
3.9.9.  In recognition of the difficulties involved in undertaking stability tests on existing vessels, the 
Rule allowed that such ships did not have to comply with the stability requirements until 
1 February 2002, 2 years  after Part 40D came into force.  
3.9.10.  The advisory circular that accompanied Part 40D allowed that an alternative method on 
trawlers of less than 12 m in length could be used to determine the initial metacentric height 
(GM, see Appendix 3 ) of a vessel by carryi ng out an inclining test on the vessel in the 
departure for the fishing grounds condition and using the displacement of the vessel in the 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 17 >>
 calculation.  This alternative method circumvented the need for lines plans , so cost less than a 
full stability analys is.  Safe ship management companies applied to Maritime N ew Zealand  to 
be allowed to conduct other methods of alternative stability tests on inshore trawlers of less 
than 16 m in length and a main engine of less than 200 kW (270 horsepower ).  On 26 
Septemb er 2001 Maritime N ew Zealand  accepted the alternative stability method proposed 
by SGS M&I, a safe ship management company.  The Easy Rider  had an engine rating of 
89.84  kW, was less than 16 m in length and had been, in 200 3, trawling in the inshore area, 
so met the conditions for the alternative stability test.   
3.9.11.  The Easy Rider  had an alternative stability test done in October 2003  for a new owner when 
the vessel was sold.  However , details were unavailable as to any recommendations from the 
SSM company 's naval architect with respect to loading .  The records have been lost over time.   
3.9.12.  The assumption is that the Easy Rider  must have passed this stability test because the 
Commission has obtained evidence that it was at some point fitted with a trawl gantry and was 
used at some time for trawling.  However, the trawl gantry had at some time been removed 
and was not fitted at t he time the vessel  capsized on the accident voyage.  This information is 
provided for later discussion on the issue, the retention of ship records and the possible loss 
of safety -critical information  
Safe ship management responsibilities  
3.9.13.  On 6 September 2011 Maritime New Zealand issued a safe ship management certificate to 
AZ1 Enterprises Limited for the Easy Rider .  This meant that AZ1  Enterprises  Limited , as the 
owner of the Easy Rider , was responsible for meeting the safe ship management  obligations 
for this vessel.  
3.9.14.  The New Zealand Safe Ship Management Code as contained in Appendix 6 of Maritime Rule 
Part 21 , Safe Ship Management Systems stated that the safe ship management system 
should ensure:  
 compliance with mandatory rules and regulat ions 
 that applicable codes and standards prescribed or recommended by the Maritime Safety 
Authority were taken into account.  
 
3.9.15.  The Code placed certain responsibilities on the owner of a vessel , which  included:  
 providing  for safe practices in ship operation and a safe working environment  
 establish ing safeguards against all identified risks . 
3.9.16.  Paragraph 3.1 of the Code stated  that the owner should define and document the 
responsibilit ies, authorit ies and interrelation s of all personnel who manage d, perform ed and 
verified work relating to and affecting safety and pollution prevention.  
3.9.17.  Paragraph 6.1 of the Code stated that t he owner should ensure that the master was: 
 properly qualified to command  
 fully conversant with the owner's Safe Ship Management System . 
3.9.18.  Paragraph 6.4 of the Code stated that t he owner should ensure that all personnel involved in 
the owner's Safe Ship Management System had an adequate understanding of relevant 
mandatory rules and regulations .

 Report 12 -201 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The Easy Rider  was trans porting extended family to an island where they were to prepare for 
the upcoming muttonbird  harvest.  The accident happened 6 years after the Kotuku  tragedy, 
in which 6 members of an extended family had also lost their lives in Foveaux Strait while 
returni ng, by fishing vessel , from islands after completing  the muttonbird  harvest.  The 
circumstances of the 2 tragedies were different.  Nevertheless, in each case a fishing vessel 
not normally used for transport ing passengers and their equipment was involved, and in each 
case standards  of the day and  the Maritime Rules  were not met.  During the course of this 
investigation the Commission talked to the owners , and inspected the operation , of 4 vessels 
that were being prepared to transport passengers and their effects to Titi Islands.  Those 
inspections showed that many of the lessons from the Kotuku  tragedy had been heeded , at 
least  by those operators , and that , as a rule , other boats involved in transporting people to the 
Island s for the muttonbird harvest appeared to be fit for purpose  and were  being operated in 
compliance with Maritime Rules .   
4.1.2.  For the 2013 muttonbird  season approximately 5 commercial operators said that they would 
be operating vessels to the Titi Islands.   These 5 vessels were correctly certified and had been 
surveyed as suitable for that purpose by Maritime New Zealand.  Maritime New Zealand 
estimated that p rior to the start  of the muttonbird  season up to 12 vessels of other classes 
might  also intend  operating at times to the Titi Islands .  This was an estimate only because the 
situation change d from one year to the next.  Other means for accessing the Titi Islands were 
available, such as using helicopters.  Maritime New Zealand though t that some of t hese 
vessels might  be commercial fishing vessels being used to transport family members , similar 
to the Easy  Rider  situation.   Maritime New Zealand had consulted the muttonbird  associations 
and made it known that skippers  and anybody intending to travel on   these other vessels 
could  request a free "safety check" from Maritime New Zealand before departure from Bluff.  
4.1.3.  Every vessel has limits to what it can withstand.  If the crew does not know these  limits  then  
the risk of exceeding them could be high .  If th ey were to push the margins or knowingly 
exceed them , the risk of  there being an accident  would increase .  It follows then that no vessel 
is immune from capsize regardless of how structurally sound it is, how well it has been 
maintained, and how inherently  stable it is.  An overloaded vessel with poor stability might 
survive a trip in good weather and a properly loaded vessel might survive a trip in severe 
weather, but a poorly loaded vessel with poor stability in severe weather will be at serious risk 
of capsize .   
4.1.4.  The Easy Rider  had been operated by several owners during its 42 -year history , sometimes as 
a pleasure boat, but primarily as a commercial fishing boat.  It had no doubt operated in worse 
sea conditions than those it ex perienc ed on the night it sank, but the weather conditions were 
not good.  The boat was heavily loaded on the accident trip, and it had marginal stability when 
it departed from Bluff.    
4.1.5.  This following section analyses what happened to the Easy Rider  to cause it to capsize.  It also 
discusses how it came to be in that location in those weather conditions under the command 
of a skipper who did not hold the necessary qualification  to be in command.    
4.1.6.  The analysis also examines the regulatory system of which the Easy Rider  was part of over the 
years and the opportunities the system had for reducing the risk of the accident.    
4.1.7.  When an accident like this occurs, the consequences of it are largely dependent on: someone 
being alerted to the accident; the emer gency response to the accident; the preparedness of 
the vessel and crew to deal with the emergency; and the equipment that is available to 
preserve life while help is on its way.  These issues are discussed also.    
4.1.8.  Of the 4 bodies recovered , one passenger was found to have a level of alcohol in his blood 
and one crew member was found to have a high level of THC, the active ingredient of 
cannabis.  The report discusses the effect s of alcohol and cannabis on the ability of people to 
survive in cold water.   
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 19 >>
 4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  Although the Easy Rider  was 42 years old, it had undergone extensive restoration under the 
guidance of a surveyor, then successfully entered into the safe ship management system.  
There were a number of deficiencies that the inspector noted in  his preliminary inspection of 
the Easy Rider  earlier on the day that it departed Bluff, but no evidence was found that any of 
these deficiencies directly contributed to the accident.  The description of events given by the 
sole surviving crew member was u seful in discounting a number of other factors that could 
contribute to a boat capsizing.   
4.2.2.  There did not appear to be any malfunction with the boat or its equipment, although this could 
not be entirely ruled out because the sole survivor was not in the wh eelhouse at the time, but 
was instead out on deck.  The description he gave was of the boat being overwhelmed by a 
wave, or waves.  This possibility is now explored further.

4.3. Stability (weight and balance)  
4.3.1.  The stability of the Easy Rider  was calculated from the data available.  The Commission did 
not have the "as-built" lines plan of the vessel, but it obtained sufficient data to build a 
stability model of the vessel that was accurate enough to determine  that the Easy Rider  had 
low stability reserve when it departed Bluff.  Appendix 4 shows the detail of this stability 
assessment and any limitations with its accuracy.    
4.3.2.  Figure 4 shows  3 stability curves (GZ curves) using the model created for the Easy Rider : one 
shows a typical departure condition; one shows a typical mid -voyage (50% load) condition ; and 
the other shows the departure condition from Bluff for the accident voyage.  A sample stability 
curve is shown for comparative purposes.   
4.3.3.  This fourth  curve shows the min imum current -day standards set by the I nternational Maritime 
Organi zation  for fishing vessels.  At the time the Easy Rider  was designed and built , these 
requirements had not been written, and due to its size the Easy Rider  was not and would still 
not be re quired to comply with these requirements.   
4.3.4.  The d ynamic stability is the stability characteristic of a vessel when moving (particularly rolling) 
and is the energy necessary to incline the vessel to a certain angle of heel.  The dynamic 
stability may be det ermined by measuring the area under the righting lever curve (GZ curve) 
up to a certain angle of heel. The larger the area, the better the dynamic stability.  The area 
under the curve is shown in blue in Figure 4.  Put another way, the larger the blue area  under 
the curve, the harder it is to capsize the vessel.  Appendix 3 gives a more detailed explanation 
of stability.  
4.3.5.  The Easy Rider  with a 50 % load is a typical condition while fishing : partially loaded with fuel, 
water, ice, bait, cod pots and fish.  The  blue area under this curve is greater  than it is when the 
vessel departs on a fishing trip.  The deck edge immerses at 10 degrees of heel but the vessel 
maintains positive stability until the angle of heel reaches 50 degrees.    
4.3.6.  The second load case shows the Easy Rider  typically loaded ready for departure on a fishing 
voyage. The vessel is full of fuel, bait, ice and stores and equipment on deck.  The blue area 
under the curve is flatter and smaller.  The vessel is less stable and more at risk of capsize.  
The deck edge immerses at 8 degrees of heel but the vessel only maintains positive stability 
until the angle of heel reaches 37 degrees .   
4.3.7.  The third load condition shows the Easy Rider  as it was loaded ready for departure on the 
accident voyage.  The extr a load of cargo on deck and the passengers themselves raised the 
centre of gravity of the vessel and consequently the blue area under the curve is very flat and 
very small.  In this condition the deck edge immersed at 4 degrees and the vessel only 
maintain ed positive stability until the angle of heel reached 21 degrees .   
4.3.8.  The vessel in this condition is said to be "tender", meaning  that it would take only a small 
force or a small shift in weight to cause the vessel to take on an angle.  Evidence of this was  
observed by onlookers when loading the cargo at the wharf.  Placing one "lift" of wood on the 
side of the deck caused the vessel to list  noticeably .  The wood was repositioned across the 
vessel to balance the load.  Such a list caused by a relatively smal l part of the load was an 
indication to someone who understood the concept of vessel stability that there was a 
problem with the stability of the vessel.  
4.3.9.  It is important for vessel operators to know that the stability of a vessel is determined by not 
just how much weight is placed on board, but how it is distributed around the vessel.   
Generally speaking, weights loaded higher up (above the centre of gravity) will adversely affect 
stability, while the more weight that can be loaded down low (below the centr e of gravity) will 
improve the stability.   On smaller vessels, people can represent a large percentage of the load , 
and when they are standing in a wheelhouse or on deck this can be above the vessel's cent re 
of gravity.  
 

<< Page 22 >>
 Report 12 -201 4.3.10.  The fishing deck was tightly packed with fishing equipment and cargo.  If water had landed on 
the deck in significant quantit ies, it would not have had clear passage to the freeing ports.  In 
the initial moment after landing on the deck the water would have been  the equivalent of 
loading more weight on the vessel, and unlike the lashed cargo that weight would have been  
relatively free to move around.  The Commission calculated that it would have taken about 2.5 
tonnes of sea  water to fill the fishing deck to the h eight of the bulwarks.  It would have taken 
as little as 0.5 tonnes of sea  water on the deck to reduce the Easy Rider 's GM to zero.  Water 
on the fishing deck would have:  
 caused the vessel to sink lower in the water (reduced its freeboard)  
 caused a direct rise in the centre of gravity of the vessel and consequently eroded the 
already  small stability in reserve (the blue area under the curve)  
 caused an additional "virtual rise" in the vessel's centre of gravity due to the free 
surface effect , because the ent rapped water was free (albeit restricted by the deck 
cargo) to move across the vessel and exacerbate any roll angle caused by wave action.  
4.3.11.  There is a margin of error with the stability calculations for the Easy Rider  (refer to Appendix 
4).  Even so, the calculations show that the Easy Rider  was in a precarious condition from the 
time it left the shelter of Bluff Harbour.  The question then arises, how did it survive the first 4 
hours of the voyage without capsizing? .  The answer probably lies in the complexity of forces 
that act on a small vessel as it rolls and pitches in relatively large waves.    
4.3.12.  The Easy Rider 's direction of travel once reaching open waters was into the wind, waves and 
swell, so it would not have be en rolling as much as if the waves had been  coming from the 
side.  Another consideration is the amount of water on the deck.  As mentioned above, 
shipping water on a deck will erode a vessel's stability reserves , but it might not be enough to 
cause it to capsize unless it coincided with the vessel taking a sizable roll.    
4.3.13.  It could not be established with any certainty how far off the  Bishop and Clerks Islands the 
skipper intended to pass.  The general area where t he Easy Rider  was thought to have 
capsized was one of known turbulent waters , more so the closer a boat got to the Islands .  The 
area  was also close to where the skipper would start to adjust the course to head down the 
west coast of Stewart Island.  Guidi ng a vessel through a confused sea at night and when the 
visibility is reduced by rain is difficult.  Waves approaching from different direction s will 
possibly not be visible to the skipper until it is too late to react, particularly with a slow -speed 
displacement vessel that will take some time to turn.   
4.3.14.  The surviving deckhand said  that the Easy Rider  was engulfed by a wave from the side, 
causing it to heel over.  The waves had generally been taken on the bow while the Easy Rider  
headed westwards  toward t he Bishop and Clerks Islands.  A wave coming from the side could 
have been  due to the confused sea in the area or it could have result ed from the Easy Rider  
changing cour se (whether planned or not).  No -one really knows for sure.  The surviving 
deckhand's account of what happened is understandable  given what we now know about the 
stability.  He first heard a large wave, which for him to single it out from the ambient noise 
would indicate possibly a breaking wave large r than the average  waves .   
4.3.15.  He noted that when the wave hit , "the deck filled with water and I was washed to the port side 
of the vessel  - the vessel then heeled sharply to port".    
4.3.16.  The deck becoming immersed in water would have eroded the vessel's already -small reserves 
of stability . The wav e heeled it over past the angle of  vanishing  stability - and it capsized .   
Finding s  
The Easy Rider  capsized when it was engulfed by what was probably a large breaking 
wave, which reduced the vessel's stability by landing sea  water onto the fishing deck, at 
the same time as rolling the vessel past the angle where it lost any chance of recovery . 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 23 >>
  
The Easy Rider  was loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the 
boat with insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it depart ed from 
Bluff.  
4.4. Voyage planning and climatic conditions  
4.4.1.  The actual weather conditions in Foveaux Strait during the night of 14/15 March were similar 
to those that had been forecast (see Appendix 1).  MetService  had forecast the wind to be 
about 25 knots at the western end of Foveaux Strait , with the sea becoming high for a time 
with a southwest swell of 3 metres and easing.  The computer model for the combined wind 
and swell waves provided by MetService after th e accident gave a significant wave height in 
the area of the accident of about 3 metres , with a note to indicate there would be occasional 
waves as much as 25% higher and isolated waves up to 50% higher.   
4.4.2.  These weather conditions were not ideal , but shoul d have been manageable for a well  
founded fishing vessel the size of the Easy Rider , provided it was operated with care.  
Navigation at night in small vessels carries an increased risk because the skipper s cannot see 
far ahead to "read " the waves and react accordingly.  The situation is made worse if visibility is 
restricted by rain.  It was not prudent to embark on the voyage that night g iven that the Easy 
Rider  was also heavily loaded and was carrying passengers .  Other experienced fis hermen had 
read the forecast and stayed in Bluff that night  - others had delayed their departure s until the 
cold front had passed.  The pre -arranged rendezvous with the helicopter the following morning 
was one likely reason for the skipper deciding to depa rt that night.  The helicopter had been 
arranged to offload supplies and equipment from 4 other vessels at the same time.    
4.4.3.  The Easy Rider  departed from Bluff Harbour at about 2000 , which was just about at high tide.  
As the tide ebbed, the general directi on of the tidal flow was to the west, so the skipper  would 
have gained the advantage of the current for the duration of the transit of Foveaux Strait.  As 
the Easy Rider  headed to the area of the Bishop and Clerks Islands it still had the tidal current 
running with it.  In this case the tidal current would have been running against the wind and 
the prevailing waves.   When waves encounter a current flowing in the opposite direction they 
get steeper, taller and closer together.  
4.4.4.  Another phenomenon that can alt er wave characteristics is w hen surface waves  move towards 
shallow water .  They slow down, their wave height  increases and the distance  between waves 
decreases.  This behaviour is called "shoaling ", and the waves are said to shoal. The waves 
may or may not build to the point where they break , depending on how large they were to 
begin with and how steep the slope of the sea bed is.  In particular, waves shoal as they pass 
over submerged banks or reefs. This can be treacherous for vessels and ships  (World 
Meteorological Organization, 1998) .   
4.4.5.  The area around  the Bishop and Clerks Islands is generally shallow , at around 50 metres 
depth.  Close in to the Islands is an  area renowned for shoaling, tidal eddies and rips.  The 
general area given for the capsize is approximate only.  No -one knows for sure  how close to 
the Bishop and Clerks Islands the Easy Rider  was when it capsized, but it was entirely 
predictable  for it to en counter larger -than -the-average (significant wave height) waves in the 
area .  It was also predictable that waves could come from different directions in such an area.  
A small vessel such as the Easy Rider  entering this area at night in heavy weather would  be 
particularly vulnerable . 
4.4.6.  The interested person submitted that a "rogue wave" from a direction other than the normal 
swell had capsized the Easy Rider .  The Commission considered this possibility and 
determined that i t was possible ; however, it would not necessarily have taken a "rogue wave " 
to cause the Easy Rider  to capsize in its current condition of stability.  
4.4.7.  The height of the Easy Rider  above the waterline was 2.8 metres.  With the significant wave 
height at 3 meters, an isola ted wave 4.5 metres high can be expected (50% more than the 
significant wave height).  Such a wave could have easily engulf ed the Easy Rider , especially if 
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 12 -201 it came from the side and was standing up and breaking (steeper) due to the complexities of 
the tide s and wind/wave direction in the area.   Using the same stability model that was used 
to produce the 3 conditions of stability referred to earlier in the report, t he Commission 
calculated that it would have taken only about half of one tonne of sea water to  deposit on the 
Easy Rider 's deck to reduce its GM to zero, ignoring any free  surface effect.  It need not have 
been a particularly large wave to achieve that.  With this amount of water captured on the 
fishing deck and w ith the stability reserves at near zero, the Easy Rider  would have had little 
or no resistance to being capsized as it  rolled in response to any wave , large or small . 
4.4.8.  The tidal current was heading to the west, the wind waves were coming from the north west 
and the swell waves were coming fro m the southwest.  The resultant wave spectrum anywhere 
at the western end of Foveaux Strait would have been  complex , with the possibility of waves 
coming from more than one  direction .  
4.4.9.  In such an area mariners can expect nodes (areas) of lower -than -average -height waves and 
nodes of higher -than -average -height waves.  Some of the nodes of higher -than -average wave 
height can include what is popularly known as "rogue wave s".  T Janssen , an oceanographer 
at San Francisco State University , has stated that a widel y accepted definition of a "rogue 
wave " is one roughly 3 times the average height of its neighbours.  Janssen qualifie d this by 
noting that "t his is a somewhat arbitrary cut -off - really, they are just unexpectedly  large 
waves " (Pee ples, 2009) .  Another expert has  defined  "rogue waves " as ones greater than 
twice the significant wave height (NOAA/National Weather Service, 2012) .  
4.4.10.  In summary, the Commission concludes  that the forecast and actual sea conditions on that 
night were not appropriate for a vessel the size of the Easy Rider  to take to sea , having  
marginal reserve stability.  How large the wave was that capsized the Easy Rider  is a 
debatable point, but the de bate does not resolve the underlying safety issue of poor vessel 
loading resulting in  poor  stability when heading out into deteriorating weather at night.  
4.4.11.  Had the skipper of the Easy Rider  decided to take the route to the east of Stewart Island he 
might ha ve had a more sheltered trip in the lee of the island.  However, the vessel would have 
first had to cross Foveaux Strait with the wind and waves on the beam.  With the Easy Rider 's 
reduced state of stability, it is feasible that it would have overturned be fore reaching that lee.  
Finding s 
The weather conditions were not suitable for the Easy Rider  to venture across Foveaux 
Strait at night, with marginal stability and with passengers on board.  
The pre -arranged rendezvous with the helicopter to coincide with unloading other 
vessels at Big South Cape Island possibly influenced the skipper's decision to continue 
with his planned departure .  
4.5. Survival aspects  
4.5.1.  It is a matter of speculation to suggest what might have happened to the passengers and crew 
who died whe n the Easy Rider  capsized.  No bodies were found in the sunken wreck when 
divers made their search.  Some may have been trapped in the upturned hull for a while and 
others may have ended up in the water almost immediately or soon after wards .  When 
someone ends up in the water there are several factors that will determine whether they 
survive.  The 2 main factors are: the time it takes for rescuers to arrive; and the life-saving 
equipment on hand to assist survival while waiting for that rescue.    
4.5.2.  Once the p assengers and crew entered the water there would have been  several other factors 
that determine d their survival time s.  These included the sea state, sea -water temperature, air 
temperature, wind chill, age, gender, anaerobic fitness, swimming ability and a ny physical 
injury sustained during the capsize.   
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 25 >>
 4.5.3.  Of the 4 bodies found following the capsize, 3 had experienced minor but not disabling 
injuries, and the cause of death was recorded as drowning for all 4. This is clearly supported 
by the presence of wate r in the lungs. There were no other medical or pathological findings 
relevant to the accident or survival in the water.    
4.5.4.  Another factor that is detrimental to cold -water survival is alcohol consumption.  Alcohol 
accelerates hypothermia through increased r ates of heat loss due to increased blood flow 
through the skin.  Therefore alcohol in the blood system reduces the chances of survival  in 
cold water  (Water Safety New Zealand, 2012) .  Of the 4 bodies recovered, one of the 
passengers had a blood -alcohol level of 125 milligrams  per 100 millilitres of blood ( 1.5 times 
the legal limit for driving a car ), which is consistent with impairment of decision -making and 
psychomotor co -ordination . It is possible that this level of alcohol reduced his  survival time 
through swim failure and/or hypothermia.    
4.5.5.  One passenger and one of the crew members reported to be asleep down below in the cabin 
at the time of the accident had levels of THC in their blood that were consistent with a recent 
consumption of cannabis.  Recent consumption may have been associated wi th mental 
impairment to the extent that it might have affected their ability to escape from the capsized 
vessel .  A crew member has safety responsibilities to all on board.    
4.5.6.  On 8 March 2011, in its report on a collision between a jet boat and a jetski (Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission, 2011) , the Commission made a recommendation to the 
Secretary for Transport regarding substance impairment in the maritime sector.  The 
recommendation reference d persons in charge of an y craft, but the same would apply to any 
crew member who had responsibilities or duties to do with the safety of passengers and other 
crew.  The recommendation and the reply on behalf of the Secretary for Transport are shown 
below:   
Until legislation is made setting limits for and testing of alcohol and other 
performance impairing substances for recreational and commercial boat drivers, the 
risk of alcohol -related accidents will be elevated.    
It is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address thi s safety issue by 
promoting appropriate legislation to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and 
other performance impairing substances for persons in charge of recreational and 
commercial craft, and supporting legislation to allow testing for such level s in these 
cases.  (005/11)    
On 16 March 2011 the Manager Maritime and Freight of the Ministry of Transport replied to 
the final recommendation:    
The recommendation is that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to set 
limits and establish a test ing regime to address the risk of recreational and 
commercial boating accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance -
impairing substances.    
Recreational and commercial boating is one of three areas of transport activity 
where no alcohol and drug  limits or testing regime yet exists.  The introduction of 
such a regime in any of these areas would be a major policy decision for government 
that would need to be informed by a thorough understanding of the problem and the 
policy options.  The Ministry t herefore intends to develop a report to government on 
the feasibility of a compulsory post -accident and incident drug and alcohol testing 
regime for the aviation, maritime and rail transport sectors.    
Accordingly, implementation of recommendation 005/11 w ould only be practicable 
once the relevant policy work had been undertaken by the Ministry, and then only if 
the results indicated that a drug and alcohol testing regime is a feasible option.  
The recommendation still had an "open " status at the time this r eport was published.

 Report 12 -201 Lifejacket s 
4.5.7.  None of the persons whose bodies were recovered was wearing a lifejacket when located.  
Prolonged immersion in cold water normally causes drowning by swim failure before death 
from hypothermia occurs.    
4.5.8.  A self -righting lifejacket will help keep the wearer's head clear of the water and its buoyancy 
will slow the onset of fatigue.  With a sea -water temperature of 13ºC and moderate seas, an 
adult male wearing an appropriate lifejacket could be expected to have a fair chance  of 
survival for up to 5  hours  (Maritime New Zealand, 2012) .  Without flotation assistance, swim 
failure caused by a combination of muscle fatigue, cramps and hypothermia can be expected 
after about 20 -30 minutes.  The deckhand surviving some  18 hours before being rescued is 
highly unusual.  His survival can be partially attributed to his time spent on the upturned hull 
before it sank, the flotation provided by the fuel container that fortuitously rose to the surface 
beside him, and a substantial amount of willpower .   
4.5.9.  A lifejacket's effectiveness and usefulness will depend on a number of factors, including:    
• the size of the lifejacket relative to the size of the wearer  
• the correct fitment of the lifejacket  
• the typ e of the lifejacket  
• the accessibility of the lifejacket  
• the nature of the emergency.  
4.5.10.  In this case the Easy Rider  did not have sufficient lifejacket s for the 9 people on board.  
Instead, it appears that there were  only 3 adult lifejacket s and one child lifejacket .  The 
interested person submitted  that there may have been 2 or 3 other lifejackets on board ; 
however, she was unable to confirm the  types, size s and condition of those lifejacket s.  She 
subsequently revised this figure upwards to 9 lifejacket s in total on board.  The Commission , 
however,  did not find evidence to support this later claim.  The average weight of all 9 persons 
on board was about 103 kilograms , and the largest person weighed  184 kilograms .  The adult 
lifejacket s that were on board w ould not have fitted securely on some of the adults on board, 
even if they had been able to access them.  The Maritime Rules provide for the carriage of 
children's lifejacket s on commercial vessels where children are likely to be carried, but is 
silent on the carriage of lifejacket s for large people.  Rule Part 91 requires skippers of 
recreational craft to have a lifejacket  of an appropriate size for every person on board.  Most 
people would understand this in the context of carrying small children, but mig ht not 
necessarily relate this to having over -sized lifejacket s for large people.    
4.5.11.  Although not relevant to this accident , the Commission has noted that Maritime Rules require 
that an approved  lifejacket  be carried for every person on board every recreational and 
commercial vessel.  While an approved lifejacket  is marked as complying with the appropriate 
standard, other lifejacket s are freely available for purchase that are not approved to the 
appropriate  standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some standard that is 
not accepted in New Zealand.  An unwary purchaser, particularly a recreational boating 
person, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a lifejacket  approved to New  
Zealand standards.    
4.5.12.  There is at least one manufacturer in New Zealand that manufactures approved lifejacket s in 
varying sizes up to XXXL, and will custom -make a lifejacket  to suit a person with a non -
standard physique for a nominal fee.    
4.5.13.  The key to the best chance of survival is to have a number of lifejackets at least equal to, or 
preferably more than, the number of people on board, and stowed in the most readily 
accessible place.  This would typically be near to, or if possible outside, the means of es cape 
from the cabin.  For a boat the size of the Easy Rider  in those sea conditions, the skipper 
should have required everyone on deck to be wearing a lifejacket.  Apparently the 2 
passengers sitting out on deck behind the wheelhouse were wearing lifejacke ts, but there is 
some question  about  whether they were properly fitted and secured.  An improperly secured 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 27 >>
 lifejacket can quickly dislodge when the wearer enters the water, particularly if the wearer 
becomes fatigued or unconscious.  The bodies of these 2 passengers were among the 4 
recovered and they were not wearing lifejackets at the time of recovery .   
4.5.14.  The child was wearing the one child's lifejacket, but this was placed on him more for warmth 
and there is some question about whether it was properly sec ured on him.  That child's 
lifejacket was later found by divers on the wreck, snagged in the deck rigging.    
4.5.15.  For any who managed to escape from the inverted hull, the availability of suitable lifejackets 
would have improved their chances of survival, wheth er that was simply to stay and wait for 
rescue or to swim for shore or to a life -raft.   
Life-raft 
4.5.16.  A life -raft is perhaps the most effective aid to survival in the event of having to abandon a 
vessel, provided it can be activated.  It keeps survivors out of the water and provides cover 
from the elements.  It also has basic survival equipment inside it.  However, the Easy Rider 's 
life-raft was only designed for 4 people.  As noted above there were 9 people on board with an 
average weight of about 103 kilogram  per person.  It would not therefore have been sufficient 
to accommodate all of the people, had they all survived the initial capsize.    
4.5.17.  There are 2 ways a life -raft can be activated: it can be manually released from its cradle and 
manually inflated ; or it can automatically release from its cradle and float to the surface, 
where it can either automatically inflate or be manually inflated.    
4.5.18.  Manual release and inflation takes time, and in thi s case where the Easy Rider  capsized 
suddenly, there was no time.  The hydrostatic release mechanism is a well proven device that 
seems to have worked on this occasion.  The life -raft was found by divers wedged between the 
bulwarks and the wheelhouse, so i t must have released from its cradle at some point.  There 
is an element of chance whether a life -raft floating free from a sinking vessel will reach the 
surface.  A lot depends on the position  of the life -raft cradle and the attitude of the vessel as it 
sinks.  From the description of the survivor , the Easy Rider  sank stern first and upside down.  
The life -raft would therefore have been prevented from floating free until the vessel rolled as it 
sank to the sea  bed (it was initially found lying on its side) .  It seems to have become wedged 
within the bulwarks before it could float free as the vessel began to right itself under water.    
Trip reports  
4.5.19.  There was a time delay of about 14 hours between when the accident happened and when 
the Easy Rider  was reporte d overdue.  That was when the vessel failed to arrive at Big South 
Cape Island for the rendezvous with the helicopter.  Even then some time was taken to 
consider reasons for it s not arriv ing.   
4.5.20.  The Easy Rider 's skipper radioed Bluff Fishermen's Radio on de parture from Bluff and 
submitted a trip report, which said where he was  and where he was going and gave an 
estimated time of arrival.  The skipper did not say which route he was intending to take to get 
there.  This type of trip report has its merits but a lso has its limitations , because there are no 
intermediate check -in points and no close -out report on arrival at the destination.  To be truly 
effective, lodging a trip report should result in an automatic response by the receiver if some 
predetermined check or close -out is not met.  Even a pre -arranged phone call with another 
family member can be beneficial, but a broadcast over a common frequency has the benefit of 
other vessels in the vicinity knowing the vessel's whereabouts.    
4.5.21.  The very high frequenc y radio coverage on the west coast of Stewart Island is limited, which 
could have preclude d the skipper closing out a trip report with Bluff Fishermen's Radio.  Under 
these circumstances an intermediate checkpoint, such as at the Bishop and Clerk Islands , 
would have provided a useful check on progress before leaving the area of good VHF radio 
coverage.

 Report 12 -201 Emergency position indicating radio bea con  
4.5.22.  The Easy Rider  was required by Maritime Rules to carry a 406 megahertz emergency position 
indicating radio bea con.  The one it carried complied with the minimum requirements.  It was 
required to be removed from its bracket, manually activated and taken with the survivor(s).  
When above water it is a quick and accurate method of alerting search and rescue that 
some thing has gone wrong.  The emergency position indicating radio beacon  transmits it s 
actual position via satellite to the search and rescue co -ordination centre.  The transmitted 
message also includes other information that will assist the authorities in th e search and 
rescue.    
4.5.23.  Divers later found the beacon still in its bracket, with the aerial in its stowage position folded 
into the bracket . The beacon was operating with the light -emitting diode flashing weakly.  This 
light-emitting diode also functions as  the strobe .  However, it cannot be inferred  that it had 
been manually activated by someone on board.  The beacon complied with international 
standards that required waterproof testing at a depth of 10 metres for 5 minutes .  The depth 
at which the beacon was found was far in excess of this, so the casing could have leaked and 
a short circuit formed , causing the operation of the beacon.  The unit is activated by pushing  
down a short -travel -length plunger that depresses a rubber diaphragm  activating a switch .  
With an external pressure of 400 kilo pascals  and a pressure differential  of 300 kilo pascals 
there may have been enough external pressure to depress the diaphragm to switch the unit 
on.  In either of the above conditions the beacon would have been transmitting into short  
circuit , and after the amount of time it was submerged in the water the batteries would have 
been close to exhaustion.  Whatever the reason for the beacon activating , unless it was above 
the sea surface its tr ansmission would  not have been picked up by the satellites.    
4.5.24.  Float -free beacons are available in New Zealand for between $800 and $1300.  These 
beacons are usually mounted outside the wheelhouse and automatically release from their 
bracket s and float to t he surface, in much the same way that a float -free life -raft does.  Like 
the life -raft, however, there is a possibility that the beacon will become entangled on its way to 
the surface in the event of a capsize.  Having it mounted outside the wheelhouse means  that 
it is more accessible for survivors to retrieve from a vessel that does not sink immediately, 
such as in the case of the Easy Rider . Despite its limitations , a float -free type emergency 
position indicating radio beacon  will have a better chance of success than a manually 
activated one inside the wheelhouse.    
4.5.25.  There is another type of emergency position indicating radio beacon  that can increase the 
chance s of survival : the personal locator beacon.  It is not required to be carried by Maritime 
Rules but can significantly improve the chance s of survival in some circumstances.  It is small 
(about the size of a cigarette packet) and fit s easily into a jacket pocket.  The personal locator 
beacon retails at about $600 and can be hired for $20 per day.  W hen activated , it perform s 
the same function as a larger emergency position indicating radio beacon , transmitting an 
accurate position and supporting information via a satellite to the search and rescue 
coordination centre.    
4.5.26.  One advantage of these smaller  beacons is that they can be worn by crew all of the time when 
working on deck.  They do have the same limitation as larger beacons in that they will not be 
effective under water.  In the Easy Rider 's case, had the surviving deckhand been wearing one 
and a ctivated it immediately, the authorities would have been alerted to the vessel's plight, 
possibly within minutes, and directed the search to the exact spot where the capsize occurred.  
If any of the other occupants  had survived the initial capsize they might have survived.  
Because of its small size and weight, the personal locator beacon can be used for other land -
based activities as well.    
4.5.27.  A personal locator beacon cannot be substituted for an emergency position indicating radio 
beacon  unless it meets  the stringent standards laid down for the watertightness, flotation, 
transmission life when activated, and transmission aerial requirements of an  emergency 
position indicating radio beacon , but it is a useful safety enhancement that private and 
commercial operators might like to consider.    
 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 29 >>
 Other available options for position monitoring and tracking  
4.5.28.  Another method of determining the position of a vessel at sea from ashore is the automatic 
identification system , which is a vessel tracking system utilising very high frequency radio 
transmitters and receivers combined with a positioning system.  The signals transmitted by 
the vessel can be tracked by shore -based stations using receiving aerials around the coast, 
and in some areas of the world, by satellites fitted with automatic identification system 
receivers.    
4.5.29.  The system was initially designed as an anti -collision aid for larger ships, but has since been 
found useful for shore -based monitoring of shipping movemen ts near and in ports and 
harbours.  Very high frequency radio works essentially on line  of sight , so the range of any 
system that uses it is limited , unless repeater stations or the satellite option s are used .  Such 
a system would have its limitations in t he context of the Easy Rider 's operation.  A dedicated 
shore station would have to have been monitoring the track and have a reason for raising an 
alarm.    
4.5.30.  When the Easy Rider  sank it was probably still within very high frequency radio coverage; 
however, it would soon have moved out of very high frequency radio range as it headed down 
the west coast of Stewart Island.  Had an observer been monitoring the vessel it would have 
given early warning that something was amiss when  its automatic identification sys tem signal 
ceased.  This assumes that someone , somewhere was actually watching the vessel at a 
certain time, which is unlikely considering the number of vessels fitted with automatic 
identification system  compared with the number of observers.  However, automatic 
identification system  data can be and is recorded, so once a vessel has been  reported as 
overdue, that information could be useful for determining the last recorded position of the 
vessel in the absence of an emergency position indicating radio bea con being activated.    
4.5.31.  At the time of writing there was no requirement in New Zealand for fishing vessels, especially 
those the size of the Easy Rider , to be fitted with an automatic identification system.  The 
International Maritime Organization 's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea  
requires automatic identification system s to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with 
gross tonnage s of 300 or more, and all passenger ships regardless of size.  An automatic 
identification system "class B" transponder (transmitter and receiver) suitable for fitting to an 
inshore fishing vessel can be purchased in New Zealand for about $2000.    
4.5.32.  There are also several commercially available satellite -based tracking systems available from 
New Zealand providers.  Some of these systems are used extensively by emergency and 
rescue services, others are used by aircraft operators for determining the loca tions of their 
assets.  The system provided to the Royal New Zealand Coastguard was used extensively by 
the Police search and rescue co -ordinators during the search for the Easy Rider .   
4.5.33.  A satellite -based tracking system use s a tracking unit that is instal led in the asset.  Using the 
global positioning system the unit calculates its position and transmits that information in real 
time by satellite and by cellular network to the provider's secure server.  The server can then 
be accessed via the Internet by t he subscriber to monitor the status of the asset and in some 
cases communicate with the asset.   
4.5.34.  There is a cost to install the tracking unit in the asset , and ongoing monthly cost s.  There is 
also an additional cost for every position fix , as this incurs satellite transmission fees and use 
of the provider's server.  At the time of writing the cost  of the transponder  from one of the New 
Zealand providers was about $1250 , with ongoing monthly costs of about $25 for the service 
and position fixes , calculated at about $6 per day assuming half -hourly transmissions.    
4.5.35.  Similar to the automatic identification system , there are limitations to the usefulness of these 
satellite -based systems for alerting someone to a situation such as the Easy Rider  capsizing.  
Again,  someone would need to be monitoring the track of the vessel 24 hours each day  for it  
to be truly effective as an emergency -alerting system.  
4.5.36.  These various other means of tracking a vessel are only mentioned here to highlight their 
availability and potentia l use.  The limitations described for each would preclude mandating 
 

<< Page 30 >>
 Report 12 -201 their use on board fishing vessels.  Nevertheless, they are options that vessel operators 
should  consider.  
 
Finding s  
The Easy Rider  did not have sufficient life -saving equipment for the 9 persons on board.  
The Easy Rider 's manually operated emergency position  indicating radio beacon had 
probably not been  intentionally  activated and was still stowed in its bracket within the 
wheelhouse when the vessel sank.  
Float -free emergency position  indicating radio beacon s and the enhancement of people 
carrying personal locator beacon s will improve the chances of being noticed and rescued, 
particularly in the event of a sudden or catastrophic event such as a capsize.  
It has not been possible to deter mine how many,  if any , of the 8 persons who died survived 
the initial capsize, and if so for how long they survived.  
There were as few as 4 approved lifejacket s on board the Easy Rider  to be shared among 9 
people, which not only contravened Maritime Rules but significantly reduced the chances 
of persons not wearing lifejacket s surviving in the water after the vessel capsized.  
The Easy Rider 's life -raft was in current survey and was properly installed, but was not able 
to float free to the surface becau se it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the 
bulwarks as the vessel was sinking.  Rated for 4 persons only, the life -raft did not have 
suffic ient capacity to cater for the 9 persons on board.  
4.6. Regulatory  
Record -keeping  
4.6.1.  Prior to the introduction of Maritime Rule Part 21 (Safe Ship Management)  in 1997 , the Easy 
Rider  was not required to be in survey and had never been required to undergo a stability 
assessment.  Even then it was not engaged in trawling or lifting what was considered to be 
heavy weights, so there was still no requirement for a stability assessment.    
4.6.2.  It was not until the Easy Rider  was modified  for inshore trawling  in 2003 that a stability 
assessment was required.  This assessment was carried out in September/October 2003 and 
a fit-for-purpose certificate for inshore trawling was issued.  The Easy Rider  went through a 
succession of owners between 2003 and 2005, and at some time during this period the 
stability assessment booklet was lost or not handed on to another owner.    
4.6.3.  The stability information in that booklet would have been superseded by the vario us 
modifications made to the vessel over the years.  For example , the removal of the trawl gantry 
would have improved the stability by removing weight from higher up on the vessel.  However, 
there were a number of vessels built to the same design, what bec ame known as the 
"Owenga " design, and it was recognised early on that the design had limited reserve stability.  
In some cases ballast was added to the vessels to improve their stability.  In one case the 
surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the  wheelhouse warning skippers not to 
load too much on deck.  These earlier observations are supported by the calculations made by 
the Commission.    
4.6.4.  Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient information 
about the Easy Rider , despite the fact that it was a vessel that was still actively in the  maritime 
regulatory  system.  Maritime New Zealand was not able to find the older part of the ship file.  
Consequently the Commission had to rely on records from other vessels in or der to make a 
reasonable assessment of the Easy Rider 's stability.   
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 31 >>
 4.6.5.  When the Easy Rider  was converted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo a 
simplified stability assessment, which it did.  Unfortunately, when the records were sourced 
from the s afe ship management company only partial details of the inclining test and stability 
calculation were available.  These details did not include a copy of the stability advice letter 
said to have been sent to the owner.  Such a letter would normally include  recommendations 
on the loading of the vessel.    
4.6.6.  When the Commission made an urgent safety recommendation to the Director of Maritime 
New Zealand in April 2012, to notify owners of other "Owenga " design vessels and alert them 
to the stability characteristics of their vessels, the lack of current records made this task 
difficult , and even today some doubt remains over how many fishing vessels built to this 
design still exist.    
4.6.7.  With the introductio n of the Maritime Transport Act the maritime ship records were transferred 
from the Marine Department of the Ministry of Transport to the newly  formed Maritime Safety 
Authority (now Maritime New Zealand ).  Later , with the introduction of Safe Ship Manageme nt, 
these records were transferred to Marine and Industrial.  Marine and Industrial was the entity 
that had formerly been the survey division of the Mari ne D epartment, then became one of the 
bigger safe ship management companies.  Confronted with storage i ssues , Marine and 
Industrial either returned the ship files to the vessel owners that wanted them  or had the files 
destroyed.    
4.6.8.  Transfer s between safe ship management companies of ship files and information from ship 
files have been a problem in the past.  Safe Ship Management companies are commercial 
operators competing for the same clients.  Unless there is a central repository for information 
on ships that remain in the maritime system, these commercial interests could result in 
important records being l ost in future.  The safe ship management system is about to undergo 
a change to the Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS).  The Commission recommends that 
the Director of Maritime New Zealand adopt a strategy under the Public Records Act 2005 
that ensures  that important ship records are maintained until vessels make permanent exit s 
from the New Zealand maritime system and for a specified number of years following that.    
Status of the Easy Rider  and the accident voyage  
4.6.9.  The Commission received a  substantive  submission from the interested person regarding  the 
status of the Easy Rider  and the nature and purpose of its voyage at the time of the accident.  
The key components of this submission can be summarised, as follows:  
 the voyage of the Easy Rider  on the day of the accident comprised 2 legs.  The first leg 
involved transporting family members to Big South Cape Island  to gather muttonbirds.  The 
second leg (commencing from the moment the passengers left the vessel) was less clear.  
It may or may not  have involved commercial fishing (the  interested person  could not 
confirm  the intentions of the skipper)  
 at the time of the accident (i.e. on the first leg) the Easy Rider  was not a commercial fishing 
vessel but rather a pleasure vessel  
 at the time of the  accident (i.e. on the first leg) the Easy Rider  was not engaged in 
commercial fishing.  Rather it was engaged on a private and "customary" voyage for the 
purpose of transporting family members to Big South Cape Island to gather muttonbird s in 
accordance w ith their  customary rights, as affirmed by the Titi (Muttonbird) Islands 
Regulations 1978  
 the Easy Rider 's customary voyage and the crew 's and passengers' muttonbird  activities 
were recognised and governed by Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi and the Tit i 
(Muttonbird) Islands Regulations 1978  
 the Maritime Transport Act, the Fisheries Act and the Maritime Rules did not apply to the 
Easy Rider (as a fishing vessel ) or to its skipper and its owner at the time of the accident , 
as the vessel was a recreational  vessel engaged on a "customary voyage" for the purpose 
of gathering muttonbird s. 
 

<< Page 32 >>
 Report 12 -201 Customary voyage under the Treaty of Waitangi and Titi (Muttonbird) Islands Regulations  
4.6.10.  The Commission's statutory purpose is to determine the circumstances and causes of 
accidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Accordingly, it was not 
appropriate for the Commission to make findings about the interested person's submission 
regarding Maori customary rights and the Treaty of Waitangi unless those rig hts in some way 
contributed  to the circumstances and causes of the Easy Rider capsizing and sinking.  
However it is clear from the Titi (Muttonbird) Islands Regulations 1978 that Rakiura Maori 
have customary rights to take mutton birds from the Titi Island s.  The Commission 
acknowledges that Rakiura Maori have these rights and observes that the Waitangi Tribunal 
acknowledged the appropriateness of these regulations in its 1991 Ngai Tahu Report  (Wai 
27). 
The Commission also notes the interested person submitted a memorandum from Sir Tipene 
O'Reagan regarding the purpose of the Easy Rider voyage and the heritage surrounding such 
voyages.  In that memorandum he said that:  
The rights of access to the [Titi] islands stem from a set of statutory and regulatory 
arrangements specifically developed over generations to protect the rights of Hopu 
Titi; those rights are rooted in a customary activity protected by Article II of the Treaty 
of Waitangi.  The exercise of those rights necessarily involves voyaging and its thus 
arguable that such voyaging is subject to the same protections.   
I am not arguing that voyaging should be undertaken carelessly and without due and 
proper care to a high standard of seamanship and ne ither - as I understand it - is 
[the interested person].  
4.6.11.  The Commission  agrees that, even if the voyage had been  specifically for the purpose of 
carrying Rakiura Maori to the Titi Islands for the muttonbird season, the voyage would still 
have need ed to be carried out with due proper care . 
Commercial vessel vs pleasure craft  
4.6.12.  The distinction between a pleasure craft (or a recreational vessel) and a commercial vessel is 
important.  If the Easy Rider  had been operating as a commercial fishing vessel at the time  of 
the accident, it would have been subject to the Maritime Transport Act, the Fisheries Act and 
the Maritime Rules .  These rules were more stringent when applied to commercial fishing 
vessels than when applied  to pleasure craft.  For example : a commercia l fishing ship could not 
carry passengers; a minimum number of crew were required on board the vessel; the skipper 
was required to hold an appropriate certificate; and the vessel needed to carry a life -raft or 
EPIRB (Maritime New Zea land) . 
4.6.13.  By comparison, a skipper of a pleasure craft (although still subject to the Maritime Transport 
Act and the Maritime Rules ) did not need to have a maritime qualification, could carry other 
people on their  vessel, and there was no requirement for the vessel to have a life -raft or 
emergency position indicating radio beacon .  However, there was a key requirement to have 
one approved lifejacket  for each person on board.  
4.6.14.  From time to time owners of commercial f ishing vessels would want to use their vessels as 
recreational craft or for private voyages.  Evidence reviewed by the Commission showed that 
safe ship management companies would allow this to happen provided that the owners 
satisfied certain criteria.  Fo r example, an owner would need to inform the Ministry for Primary 
Industries that they did not intend to catch fish commercially .  The owner t hen needed  to 
inform the safe ship management company of the date (s) that their vessel would be used as a 
pleasure  craft.  Once completed, the owner could not use their  vessel for hire or reward.  
Evidence showed that Maritime New Zealand was aware of this practice .  
4.6.15.  Turning to the Easy Rider , a submission from the interested  person  claimed  that the vessel 
was operati ng as a pleasure craft at the time of its accident and that the purpose of the 
accident voyage was to transport passengers to Big South Cape Island to prepare for hunting 
muttonbird s, as was their customary right.  The interested  person , in other words, was 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 33 >>
 claiming that the skipper did not need to have an appropriate certificate and  that he was 
allowed to carry people other than crew.  
4.6.16.  The evidence collected by the Commission, however, did not support this claim.  For example, 
the eviden ce showed that the Easy Rider  was registered as a commercial fishing vessel at the 
time of the accident and that it was still owned by AZ1 Enterprises Limited.  Section 2 of the 
Maritime Transport Act state d that a pleasure boat did not include a ship that  was operated by 
a business.  Further, the Maritime Transport Act state d that a pleasure boat did not include " a 
ship that [was]  used on any voyage for pleasure if it [was]  normally used or intended to be 
normally used as a fishing ship or for the carriage  of passengers or cargo for hire or reward".  
Evidence shows that t he Easy Rider  had been used to fish commercially , as recent ly as 6 days 
before the accident.  
4.6.17.  In terms of the accident voyage, the Commission did not find records proving that the owner of 
the Easy Rider  had satisfied the criteria for converting the Easy Rider  from a fishing vessel to a 
pleasure craft.  There was no evidence that the vessel had been deregistered and that the 
owner had informed the Ministry for Primary Industries and the safe ship management 
company that the Easy Rider  would be used as a pleasure craft on the day of the accident.  
Nor was any of the fishing gear removed from the vessel.  On the contrary, the Easy Rider  was 
loaded with salt, ice, cod pots and a significant quant ity of fish bait on the accident voyage 
(not consistent with a pleasure voyage only).  In addition, the surviving deckhand confirmed 
that he had been  on board the vessel as part of the crew and that he had been  expecting to 
go fishing and to be paid accord ingly.  Contrary to  the interested  person's  submission, the 
surviving crew member did not understand the accident voyage to be a private voyage for the 
sole purpose of carrying people and their equipment to prepare for muttonbird  hunting.  
4.6.18.  All these factors support the Commission's view that the skipper was intending to operate the 
Easy Rider  as a fishing vessel on the accident voyage , albeit after offloading his passengers 
and their cargo .  This meant that the skipper should not have carrie d passengers on the 
accident voyage (which he did) and he should have had an inshore launch master's certificate 
(which he did not).  
Safe ship management  
4.6.19.  Every New Zealand flagged commercial vessel has to comply with the safe ship management 
requirements provided under Maritime Rule Part 21.  Safe ship management require s vessel 
owners to be responsible for  safety  and pollution prevention in the day -to-day operation of 
their vessels.   
4.6.20.  The safe ship management system aims to ensure that all aspects of the operation remain fit  
for purpose and includes systems for hazard management, crew training and maintaining the 
condition of the vessel.  These are to be detailed in a safe ship management manual, which 
has to be developed by individual vessel owners to be specific to their vessels.  The checks 
and maintenance work specified in the manual and maintenance plan s had to be done as 
scheduled, and recorded in a logbook (or similar) to show that vessel safety was being 
managed throughout the year, not just on surv ey day5. 
4.6.21.  Serious responsibilities come with the ownership and operation of a vessel.  These are clearly 
stated in the Maritime Transport Act 1994 , the Fisheries Act 1996 , the Maritime Rules and 
the Health and Safety in Employment Act  1992 .  These responsib ilities were  put in place to 
ensure the safe operation of a vessel and compliance with the requirements of New Zealand 
law.  Non -compliance could  lead to serious or tragic consequences, as it did in this case.  
4.6.22.  The owner of the Easy Rider  did not appear to understand the concept of safe ship 
management  although it appears that it was making an attempt to comply.  The fundamental 
problem was that the owner seemed to be  under the impression that safe ship management

<< Page 34 >>
 Report 12 -201 was an exercise that the company had to go t hrough to enable the vessel to catch fish and to 
sell it commercially.   
4.6.23.  The Easy Rider  had entered the safe ship management system on 6 September 2011 , when 
Maritime New Zealand issued AZ1 Enterprises Limited with a safe ship management 
certificate (parag raphs 3.4.6 to 3.4.12).  This s afe ship management membership meant that 
the owner had to (among other things):  
 ensure that the skipper and crew complied with the procedures in the safe ship 
management manual  
 ensure that the skipper and crew held appropria te qualifications  
 have a valid SSM certificate displayed prominently on the vessel at all times  
 maintain the vessel in a fit -for-purpose condition at all times.  
4.6.24.  It also meant that the skipper had similar responsibilities, including an obligation to ensure 
that:  
 the vessel was operated safely, and that the safety and wellbeing of all passengers and 
crew, and the safety of cargo were  properly managed  
 all personnel employed on board were properly trained to carry out their duties safely  
 all personnel employed on board had appropriate seafarer qualifications.  
4.6.25.  The evidence reviewed by the Commission, however, showed that the owner and the skipper 
did not meet all of their safe ship management obligations on the day of the accident.  In 
particular, the evidence sh owed that the owner : 
 knew that the skipper was intending to fish commercially on the day of the accident after 
offloading his passengers and their equipment on Big South Cape Island  
 knew that  the skipper did not have the required  maritime qualification  
 did not arrange for a Maritime New Zealand safety inspector to conduct a compliance 
safety inspection of the Easy Rider  by the due date (being 6 March 2012).  
4.6.26.  The evidence also showed that the skipper:  
 operated the Easy Rider  without the appropriate maritime q ualification  
 allowed passengers and muttonbird  cargo on board the Easy Rider  even though the Easy 
Rider  would operat e as a commercial fishing vessel once the people had been landed 
ashore  
 allowed the Easy Rider  to sail poorly loaded and without adequate reserves of stability to 
complete the accident voyage  
 deliberately thwarted the Maritime New Zealand safety inspector from completing his 
safety compliance inspection of the Easy Rider  before the vessel sailed on the accident 
voyage.  
4.6.27.  From the way the skipp er loaded the Easy Rider  for the accident voyage, it appears that he did 
not understand the concept of vessel stability.  The fundamentals of stability were not covered 
in the qualified fishing deckhand  certificate  (which he had) ; however , they were  covere d in 
both the inshore launch master's certificate and the local launch operator's certificate  (which 
he did not have but which he needed to have to skipper the Easy Rider ).  The syllabus for 
these certificates include d the requirement to " understand what i s meant by good stability 
and poor stability and recognise the warning signs of poor stability ".  It also required the 
skipper to " describe the effect on stability of:  
 raising and lowering weights  
 freely suspended weights  
 free fluid surface  
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 35 >>
  low freeboard  
 obstructed freeing ports" . 
4.6.28.  Apart from obtaining the requisite qualification, the skipper could have accessed any one of 
many online documents aimed at teaching stability.  Two such examples were "A guide to 
fishing vessel stability"  (Maritime New Zealand, 2011)  and the document appended to this 
report entitled "Safety practices related to small fishing vessel stability " (Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 2009) .   
4.6.29.  Understanding t he basics of ship stability is a fundamental requirement for any commercial 
operator.  It is a fundamental requirement for anyone operating a craft of any sort, including 
people in charge of recreational craft.  
4.6.30.  The fact that the skipper did not have these qualifications and, therefore, did not receive 
formal training on the fundamentals of vessel stability explains, in part, why he allowed the 
Easy Rider  to sail overloaded and without adequate reserves of stabili ty to complete the 
accident voyage.  
4.6.31.  The submission received from the interested  person claimed  that AZ1 Ente rprises Limited did 
not "own" the vessel as it had been gifted to the skipper by a family member.  Accordingly, AZ1 
Enterprises Limited  was not resp onsible for performing the safe ship management obligations 
in respect of the Easy Rider .   
4.6.32.  The Commission sought advice from Maritime New Zealand on this point.  Maritime New 
Zealand confirmed that:  
The 1983 Fisheries Act has been replaced by the Fisherie s Act 1996 and section 
103 of the new Act now provides for vessel registration for fisheries purposes 
placing the obligation on registration on the operator of the vessel.  Under this new 
Act, "operator" includes any person who has lawful possession of the  ship.  The 
FishServe register states the operator of Easy Rider as AZ1 Enterprises Ltd … 
Under maritime law, a valid Safe Ship Management (SSM) certificate must be held 
to operate a commercial fishing ship.  Part 21 of the maritime rules requires the 
owner  of the ship to apply for this certificate.  According to Mar itime New Zealand 
records, AZ1 Enterprises Limited applied to the Director of Maritime New Zealand as 
the owner of the Easy Rider for a SSM certificate on 7 July 2011.  The SSM 
certificate was is sued to AZ1 Enterprises Limited on 6 September 2011.  
In light of the above, Maritime New Zealand considers AZ1 Enterprises Limited to be 
the owner of Easy Rider.  
4.6.33.  The interested  person then submitted that the vessel's safe ship management certificate had 
automatically lapsed before the accident voyage , thereby turning the Easy Rider  into a 
pleasure craft and releasing the owner and skipper from all safe ship management 
obligations.  The interested person  based this argument on the fact that the Maritime New 
Zealand inspector had failed to complete the Easy Rider  safety compliance inspection by 6 
March 2012 (a requirement of the Easy Rider 's safe ship management certificate, which 
Maritime New Zealand issued for the vessel on 6 September 2011 ).  Accordingly, w hen the 
Easy Rider  sailed on the accident voyage (15 March 2012) a condition of its safe ship 
management certificate had not been met.  
4.6.34.  The Commission sought further advice from Maritime New Zealand on this point.  Maritime 
New Zealand confirmed that:  
 when a ship is normally used, or is intended to be normally used, as a fishing vessel it is a 
commercial ship  
 in these circumstances, the commercial ship must have a valid SSM certificate, as per Part 
21 of the Maritime Rules  
 

<< Page 36 >>
 Report 12 -201  where a ship fails to have such a c ertificate , the owner/operator of the ship is in breach of 
the Maritime Rules  and the Maritime Transport Act ; however, this failure does not cause 
the ship in question to become a pleasure craft.  
4.6.35.  The Commission examined other matters when considering the interested person's  
submission that the Easy Rider  had been outside the safe ship management system at the 
time of the accident.  For example, the skipper's actions before and on the day of the accident 
voyage strongly indicated 2 things: first, that the Easy Rider  was being operated as a 
commercial fishing vessel ; and, second, that he and the owner had every intention of 
continuing to operate the Easy Rider  within the safe ship management system.  This first 
contention is supported by the discussion in the  section above (pleasure versus commercial 
vessel) and by the fact that the skipper had fished and declared a commercial catch after 6 
March 2012 (i.e. after the date for completing the safety compliance audit).  Therefore if (as 
the interested person  claimed) the Easy Rider  safe ship management certificate had expire d 
on 6 March 2012, the skipper continued to fish commercially after this date contrary to the 
Fisheries Act.  
4.6.36.  The first contention is also supported by the fact that section 2 of the Maritime Tr ansport Act 
states that a pleasure craft cannot be a ship that is operated or provided by a business.  In 
other words, the fact that AZ1 Enterprises Limited owned the Easy Rider  and operated a 
fishing business in relation to that vessel meant that the Easy  Rider  could not be a pleasure 
craft under section 2 of the Maritime Transport Act.  
4.6.37.  The second contention is supported by the fact that the skipper made arrangements with the 
Maritime New Zealand safety inspector for him to complete the compliance inspecti on before 
the Easy Rider  was to leave on the accident voyage.  For example, on 13 March (2 days before 
the accident voyage), the skipper spoke with the inspector and arranged for him to return the 
next day to complete the inspection.  When the inspector re turned the next day, the skipper 
asked him to return one hour later.  The inspector did this but upon beginning the inspection 
he realised that the skipper was not fully prepared for it.  He and the skipper then agreed that 
the inspector would return on 16  March 2012 to complete the compliance inspection 
(paragraphs 3.1.3 to 3.1.7).  
4.6.38.  Although it turned out that the skipper had no intention of keeping this appointment with the 
inspector, the skipper's actions caused the inspector to believe that the Easy Ride r would 
continue to remain within the safe ship management system.  At no time did the skipper 
confirm (or even intimate ) to the inspector that this was to change.  
Finding s  
The skipper's intention was for the Easy Rider  to operat e as a commercial fishing vessel on 
the accident voyage , as he fully intended to go fishing commercially once his passengers and 
their equipment  had been offloaded . 
Neither the owner nor the skipper sought or was given a dispensation by the safe ship 
manage ment company or the Director of Maritime New Zealand to operate as a pleasure 
vessel for the accident voyage, which meant that the Easy Rider  was a commercial fishing 
vessel and should not have been carrying any person other than its crew.  
Although the Easy Rider  had been entered into the safe ship management system, it was 
never going to help the owner and skipper to run a safe fishing operation, because the owner 
did not understand the principles of safe ship management and the skipper did not appear 
to show a willingness to comply with the rules.  
The owner of the Easy Rider  was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe 
operation of the vessel , as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules .   
The skipper did not hold the qualification required for him to be in charge of the Easy Rider  
on the accident voyage.  
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 37 >>
 The skipper did not have the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if he did , he did not 
apply it wisely when loading the Easy Rider  for the trip.  The Easy Rider  being overloaded , 
with the average distribution of weight being too high , was the prime factor leading to its 
capsize.  
A historical lack of common and good -standard practice for keeping ship operation and 
safety records has res ulted in the loss of important information about commercial vessels 
that are still operating today.  
Because commercial  vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch 
between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to 
maintain a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life 
of each vessel in the system.    
 
 

<< Page 38 >>
 Report 12 -201 5. Findings  
5.1. The Easy Rider  capsized when it was engulfed by what was probably a large breaking wave, which 
reduced the vessel's stability by landing sea  water onto the fishing deck, at the same time as 
rolling the vessel past the angle where it lost any chance of recovery . 
5.2. The Easy  Rider  was loaded with too much weight, too high up on deck, which left the boat with 
insufficient reserve stability for its intended voyage when it departed from Bluff.  
5.3. The weather conditions were not suitable for the Easy Rider  to venture across Foveaux Strait at 
night, with marginal stability and with passengers on board.  
5.4. The prearranged rendezvous with the helicopter to coincide with unloading other vessels at Big 
South Cape Island possibly influenced the skipper's decision to  continue with his planned 
departure.  
5.5. The Easy Rider  did not have sufficient life -saving equipment for the 9 persons on board.  
5.6. The Easy Rider 's manually operated emergency position  indicating radio beacon had probably not 
been intentionally activated and w as still stowed in its bracket within the wheelhouse when the 
vessel sank.  
5.7. Float -free emergency position  indicating radio beacon  and the enhancement of people carrying 
personal locator beacon s will improve the chances of being noticed and rescued, particul arly in 
the event of a sudden or catastrophic event such as a capsize.  
5.8. It has not been possible to determine how many,  if any , of the 8 persons who died survived the 
initial capsize, and if so for how long they survived.  
5.9. There were as few as 4 approved lifejacket s on board the Easy Rider  to be shared among 9 
people, which not only contravened Maritime Rules  but significantly reduced the chances of 
persons not wearing lifejacket s surviving in the water after the vessel capsized.  
5.10.  The Easy Rider 's life -raft wa s in current survey and was properly installed, but was not able to 
float free to the surface because it became lodged between the wheelhouse and the bulwarks as 
the vessel was sinking.  Rated for 4 persons only, the life -raft did not have sufficient capac ity to 
cater for the 9 persons on board.  
5.11.  The skipper's intention was for the Easy Rider  to operat e as a commercial fishing vessel on the 
accident voyage , as he fully intended to go fishing commercially once his passengers and their 
equipment had been offl oaded.  
5.12.  Neither the owner nor the skipper sought or was given a dispensation by the safe ship 
management company or the Director of Maritime New Zealand to operate as a pleasure vessel 
for the accident voyage, which meant  that the Easy Rider  was a commercia l fishing vessel and 
should not have been carrying any person other than its crew.  
5.13.  Although the Easy Rider  had been entered into the safe ship management system, it was never 
going to help the owner and skipper to run a safe fishing operation, because the owner did not 
understand the principles of safe ship management and the skipper did not appear to show a 
willingness to comply with the rules.  
5.14.  The owner of the Easy Rider  was not meeting its responsibilities for ensuring the safe operation 
of the vessel, as required by the Maritime Transport Act and Maritime Rules.  
5.15.  The skipper did not hold the qualification required for him to be in charge of the Easy Rider  on the 
accident  voyage.  
5.16.  The skipper did not have the requisite knowledge of ship stability, or if he did , he did not apply it 
wisely when loading the Easy Rider  for the trip.  The Easy Rider  being overloaded , with the 
average distribution of weight being too high . was th e prime factor leading to its capsize.

 5.17.  A historical lack of common and good -standard practice for keeping ship operation and safety 
records has resulted in the loss of important information about commercial vessels that are still 
operating today.  
5.18.  Because c ommercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch 
between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain 
a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel 
in the system.

 Report 12 -201 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by 2 types:  
a) safety actions taken to address safety issues identified by the Commission that would 
otherwise have resulted in the Commission issuing a recommendation  
b) safety actions taken to address other safety issues that would not normally have resulted in 
the Commission issuing a safety recommendation.  
6.2. On 31 July 2012 Maritime New Zealand advised that:  
I. Maritime New Zealand advises that it has been in contact with the 2 administrative 
committees for the Titi Islands (Rakiura Mutton Bird Committee, and Titi Island Committee) 
with proposals to introduce safety initiatives during the permit application process (all 
vessels calling at the islands must hold permits to do so, the permits being issued by the 
respective committees) including:  
(i) vessel safety standards included in the Titi Island Management Plan  
(ii) development and introduction of a safety checklist for all vessels as a pre -requisite to 
the permit proc ess 
(iii) safety measures during tender transfers to and from the Islands  
(iv) education of all groups regarding the responsibilities and penalties whilst undertaking 
either commercial or non -commercial voyages ( for example:  provisions in Section  65 of 
the Maritime T ransport Act)   
II. Maritime New Zealand advises that calls were made to all vessel owners who were thought 
to be involved in trips to the Titi Islands emphasising safety messages of:  
(i) Loading and stowage of "cargo ", and issues which may arise from using soft sided bulk 
bags and when transferring cargo to the deck of the fishing ve ssel for lift off by helicopter  
(ii) Stability risk due to stowing cargo on deck so that the heli copter could lift it off easily  
(iii) Communications  
(iv) Weather and routing considerations  
(v) Loads for return trips . 
III. Maritime New Zealand advises that the owners and operators of known "Owenga Class" 
vessels in the district were contacted to discuss stability issues .   
IV. Maritime New Zealand is in the process of de veloping (at the time of the report being 
written) an education programme on stability which it hope s to implement in about 6 
months.    
6.3. On 12 March 2013 Maritime New Zealand further advised that:  
 Good progress has been made to date with both Rakiu ra Maori and the transport 
operators;  however, there is much work still to be done on the "community education" 
aspect of the compliance tool.  Maritime New Zealand is committed to achieving a positive 
outcome.  
 Other stakeholders, including the Department of  Conservation, Environment Southland and 
the Regional Harbourmaster, have offered their support and interest to be involved where 
possible  
 The Maritime New Zealand National Advisor Industry Support (NAIS) will be talking to the 
Rakiura Titi Island Administ ration  Body about possible funding through Ngai Tahu for 
educational material to be printed.  Using this approach Maritime New Zealand is working 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 41 >>
 towards creating a partnership approach and developing a sense of ownership for safety 
outcomes by the communi ty. 
 The NAIS has been working alongside Rakiura Maori spokesmen to bring together the 2 
muttonbird  committees, transport operators and associated stakeholders to create a set of 
best practice guidelines that can be used as a self -regulating compliance tool , 
administered by the muttonbird ing communities . 
 The NAIS and Maritime Officers have spoken with committee members at 2 pre -season hui .  
Each hui showed good interest , and positive suggestions were received on the way forward . 
 The anticipated outcome is that all stakeholders participate in discussions and have 
constructive input into suggested ideas put forward by Maritime New Zealand, and 
stakeholder groups to ensure a commonly agreed and consistent approach is taken 
regarding pre -trip planning, in  regar d to safety considerations for both muttonbird ers and 
transport operators alike.

 Report 12 -201 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of recommendations to any person or organisation that 
it considers the most appropriate to address the ident ified safety issues, depending on whether 
these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport sector.  In 
this case, a recommendation has been issued to the Director of Maritime New Zealand.   
7.2. In the interests of transpor t safety it is important that these recommendations are implemented 
without delay to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Urgent recommendations  
7.3. On 18 April 2012 the Commission made the following urgent recommendation to the Director of 
Maritime New Zealand:  
The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities 
have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much 
weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in 
the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made 
preliminary calculations that support this view.  
Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessel s were built and with successive 
changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be 
aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.  
The Commission recommend ed that the Director of Maritime New Zealand trace the whereabouts 
of the remaining Owenga class fishing vessels and ensure that the appropriate stability 
calculations have been made for each vessel and alert the owners to any special stability 
characteristics they should be considering in th e daily operation of their vessels. (020/12)  
7.4. On 1 May 2012 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied to the safety recommendation as 
follows:  
The Director has commenced a process to identify all Owenga  class fishing vessels 
to assess stability characteristics and discuss associated operational requirements 
with the owners of the vessels.  It is expected that this process will be concluded by 
the end of May 2012.  
The Director is also assessing whether th ere are other vessels that may have 
similar stability characteristics requiring attention.  It is intended that this 
assessment process be completed by the end of June 2012, with decisions as to 
further action being made at that time.  
On 11 October 2012 th e Director of Maritime New Zealand further replied:  
We have completed the process to identify all Owenga class fishing vessels and 
contacted all owners to update them on carrying cargo and/or fish bins on deck.  
Owners have been advised that there is a one  tonne maximum which must not be 
exceeded when placing cargo or fish bins on deck.  All owners were also given 
information on the circumstance which led to the capsize of Easy Rider .  These 
visits were completed by May 2012.  
A stability assessment was completed of all other Owenga class vessels.  None of 
the other vessels appear to be in the same category of high risk as the Easy Rider . 
MNZ completed an assessment to identify vessels with similar characteristics as 
the Owenga class fishing vessels and started an education process using a 
simplified traffic light method called WOLSEN.  The method is based on the UK 
MCA papers on simplified stability and requires the length and breadth to calculate 
the minimum freeboard of the ve ssel required for safe operation.  This assessment 
was completed by June 2012.  
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 43 >>
 This education programme is ongoing and Maritime Safety Inspectors are 
assessing all vessels on a ship by ship basis using the WOLSEN method.  
Further recommendations  
7.5. On 13 Febru ary 2013  the Commission made the following recommendations to the Director of 
Maritime New Zealand:  
7.5.1.  Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient information 
about the Easy Rider , a vessel that was still actively in the sy stem.  Maritime New Zealand was 
not able to find the older part of the ship file.  Consequently the Commission had to rely on 
records from other vessels in order to make a reasonable assessment of the Easy Rider 's 
stability.  
When the Easy Rider  was conver ted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo a simplified 
stability assessment, which it did, but the records sourced from the safe ship management 
company included only partial details of the inclining test and stability calculation that had been 
carried out.  There was no record of the stability advice letter said to have been sent to the owner.  
Such a letter would normally include recommendations on the loading of the vessel.  
Because commercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their ow ners can switch 
between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain 
a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel 
in the system.  
The Commission recommends the Di rector of Maritime New Zealand develops and maintains a 
system for centralising important operating and safety records for every commercial vessel in the 
New Zealand maritime system, including a policy on the retention and disposal of records that 
would be st ensure records are kept for an appropriate period afte r a vessel leaves the system . 
(001/13 ) 
On 11 October 2012 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied  to the draft safety 
recommendation : 
We have a centralised  electronic database for various types of records relating to 
vessels which tracks change s in a vessel's name, ow nership  and SSM Company.  
MNZ has policies on record retention and disposal which are in accordance with 
the Public Records Act and are approved  by the Chief Archivist.  
On 31 January 2013 the Director of Maritime New Zealand further replied to the draft safety 
recommendation:  
MNZ accepts the recommendation.  Under the new Maritime Operator Safety 
System (MOSS) it will be a requirement  for all new vessels to provide all design 
approval and survey information to the Director of MNZ.  
On 23 April 2013 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied to the final safety 
recommendation:  
MNZ currently has a centralised database for records relating to vessels .  Since 
September 2008 this has included records relating to vessel name and type, 
inspections, audits, deficiencies, and corrective actions for vessels in the SSM 
system.  Ownership is recorded at the time of issue and reissue of SSM 
certificates.  In ad dition, information about each vessel is held by the Safe Ship 
Management Company responsible for carrying out functions for that vessel.  
It is proposed that the current SSM framework will be replaced with the new 
Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS).  G oing forward, this will mean that all 
key vessel information is held and managed by MNZ.  The implementation work for 
MOSS includes consideration and assessment of how best to provide for the 
transition and management of information currently held by SSM c ompanies.

 Report 12 -201 7.5.2.  Before  the Easy Rider  could be used as a pleasure craft  there were certain requirements  that the 
owner had to meet  under the Maritime Rules and the Fisheries Act .  The complete requirements 
were not contained in the safe ship management documentation.   
7.5.3.  The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand clarifies with industry 
the legal requirements around dual purpose use of vessels and the use of comme rcial vessels as 
pleasure craft , and ensures that safe ship management  documents refer to the full requirements 
an owner must comply with before the vessel  is used for another purp ose. (002/13 )  
On 11 October 2012 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied  to the draft safety 
recommendation : 
We have clarified and confirmed  our policy on the use of commercial vessel for 
pleasure trips in the new Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS) and will be 
clarifying the requirements and operator's responsibilities with industry during the 
implementation of this system.  
On 23 April 201 3 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied to the final safety 
recommendation:  
The current legal position under the Maritime Transport Act is that a ship is 
operated commercially is a commercial ship at all times and therefore required to 
comply with t he applicable provisions of the Maritime Transport Act and the 
Maritime Rules for commercial ships.  
In the case of Easy Rider, the vessel  was normally used or intended to be normally 
used as a fishing ship and was in fact embarking on a commercial fishing voyage 
when the accident occurred.  It was therefore a commercial ship at the time of the 
accident.  
MNZ is currently developing a new Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS) which 
will include clarity over the application of the rule to the non -commerical u se of a 
commercial ship.  
7.5.4.  A number of the passengers and crew on the Easy Rider  had a large physique.  There were only 3 
adult and one child lifejackets on board to share among 9 passengers and crew.  The 3 adult 
lifejackets were not large enough to be securely fitted to those passengers and crew whom had a 
large physique.  The Marit ime Rules  make provision for the carriage of children's lifejackets but 
are silent on the need for larger lifejackets to cater for people whom have a large physique.  This 
is a safety issue.  
Larger oversize approved life jackets are available in New Zealan d, and at least one manufacturer 
will custom make a life jacket to suit.  
Maritime Rules require that an approved  life jacket be carried for every person on board every 
recreational and commercial vessel.  While an approved  life jacket is marked as complying with 
the appropriate standard, other life jackets are freely available for purchase that are not 
approved  to the appropriate standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some 
other standard that is not acce pted in New Zealand.  An unwary purchaser, particularly a 
recreational boating person, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a life jacket 
approved to New Zealand standards.  This is another safety issue.    
The Commission recommends that the D irector of Maritime New Zealand addresses these 2 
safety issues in any educational campaigns by making it clear that not all life jackets that can be 
purchased in New Zealand are approved and meet the requirements of New Zealand Maritime 
Rules, and that pe rsons who have a large physique should purchase or be provided with a life 
jacket that is appropriate for their physique . (003/13 ) 
On 11 October 2012 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied  to the draft safety 
recommendation : 
We have noted above that MNZ's information is not consistent with the factual 
basis stated in this recommendation.  MNZ actively promotes and supports the 
correct use, size and fitting of lifejackets at education seminars, boat shows, and 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 45 >>
 through the boating education programmes.  This combined with on -going 
campaigns in all forms of media (including the MNZ website) to emphasise the 
variety of valuable information on choosing the correct lifejacket for all boating 
activities; and will continue to promote these messages.  
On 23 Apri l 2013 the Director of Maritime New Zealand replied to the final safety 
recommendation:  
The Commission has identified two safety issues, namely a potential lack of 
awareness by the public of the importance of ensuring that life jackets are an 
appropriate s ize for the intended person (including those of larger physique); and 
the risk that a person wishing to purchase a lifejacket may be misled into believing 
that the lifejacket is approved when this is not the case.  
Maritime Rules (Part 91 definition of PFD)  provide that a personal flotation device 
(PFD), which includes a lifejacket, carried and used on board a recreational craft 
must be certified by a recognised authority as meeting NZ standard NZS 5823 
series or a national or international standard that the  Director is satisfied 
substantially complies with these standards.  
The Director has made such determinations in respect of a number of such 
national and international standards.  This includes Australian, US, ISO and EN 
standards.  The Directors's determi nation in respect of these standards is available 
on the MNZ website, including advice on choosing the appropriate PFD.  
MNZ also actively promotes and supports the correct use, size and fitting of life 
jackets at education seminars, boat shows, and through  boating education 
programmes.  MNZ also conducts ongoing campaigns in all forms of media 
(including the MNZ website) to emphasise the variety of valuable information on 
choosing the correct life jacket for all boating activities.  These messages will 
continue to be promoted.

 Report 12 -201 8. Key lessons  
 Skippers and persons in charge of vessels  must have at least a basic understanding of 
ship stability and how  the loading of people and equipment can affect this stability.  
 Navigating small craft in rough sea conditions at  night is an inherently dangerous activity 
and should be avoided if and when possible.  
 The life -saving equipment on a vessel of any description being used for any purpose must 
be suitable for the intended trip and for the number and size of persons on boar d. 
 Maritime Rules specify the bare minimum requirements for life -saving equipment.  
Operators should consider purchasing a higher standard of equipment that can improve 
the chances of detection and rescue in the event of a mishap.  
 Individuals and entities, including companies and directors, that own and operate 
commercial vessels must ensure that they fully understand and comply with all legal 
requirements arising from this ownership and operation.

Computer modelled wind and swell waves  
The ECMWF6 provides global analyses and forecasts of ocean waves based on 00 00 UTC and 1200 UTC 
analysis times. The following are parts of selected charts displaying the analysed wave field at 1200 UTC 
14 March 2012 (1am 15 March 2012 NZDT) for wind waves, swell waves and combined wind and swell 
waves. The full versions of these c harts together wind some explanation is in the Appendix. These charts 
depict significant wave height of deep water waves — more than 100 metres depth where bottom effects 
and shoaling do not affect wave height and direction.  
Wind waves

Deep water wind wave (driven by the local wind) significant height in the vicinity of  the north coast of 
Stewart Island was analysed at 1am 15 March 2012 to be about 3 metres near Codfish Island, and lower 
(about 2 metres) further east into Foveaux Strait.

EC_WAVE025     ANAL for 12Z     14 -MAR -2012      CWS  HT  (m)  &  Swell  DN  
The significant wave height of the combination of wind and swell waves in the vicinity of the north coast of 
Stewart Island was analysed at this time to be in a gradient from about 3 metres in Foveaux Strait to about 
3.5 metres further west about Codfish I sland. The wave direction was from the northwest.  
Note that the significant wave height is a characteristic wave height and there would be occasional waves 
as much as 25% higher, and isolated waves up to 5O% higher.  
Meteorological Observations  
MetService and the Coast Guard operate some automated weather stations in the vicinity of  
Foveaux Strait. The following stations are of interest regarding wind and sea conditions near the  
north coast of Steward Island: Puysegur Point (southern Fiordland) , Centre Island (west of  
Invercargill and Bluff), Ruapuke Island (southeast of Bluff), and Southwest Cape (southern tip of  
Stewart Island.  
A series of maps are presented below. They are timed between 10pm on 14 March to 2am on 15 March 
2012 at hourly in tervals. The station plotting model is described in the Appendix. The times displayed in the 
top left of the maps are NZDT. Where available, the Invercargill radar scan for the same time is included. 
The time stamp embedded in the image is in UTC, 13 hours  behind NZDT.  
In the descriptions with each map, the wind speed and direction in the vicinity of the north coast of Stewart 
Island is based on consideration of the wind observations from the 4 surrounding weather stations, and the 
sea state is obtained fr om that depicted in the charts of the previous section, "Computer modeled  wind 
and swell waves", on pages 4 and 5.

 At 10pm 14 March, in the vicinity of the north coast of Stewart Island, the wind was blowing from the west 
to northwest at about 20 to 25  knots. There is more or less continuous rain which was reducing the 
visibility.

 Report 12 -201 (Radar data was not available between 10:07pm and 11:45pm on 14 March 2012.)  
At 11pm 14 March, the cold front had passed to the north of Southwest Cape; the barometric pr essure was 
rising, the wind direction had changed to south of westerly, and the temperature was lowering. The wind in 
the vicinity of the north coast of Stewart Island was blowing from the west - northwest at about 25 to 30 
knots.   

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 55 >>
 At midnight between 14 and 15 March, the cold front was moving northeast over Stewart Island. The wind 
in the vicinity of the north coast of Stewart Island was blowing from the west -northwest at about 25 to 30 
knots. The significant wave height of the combination of wind and swe ll waves was in a gradient from about 
3 metres in Foveaux Strait to about 3.5 metres further west near Codfish Island. There may have been 
isolated waves of 5 metres. The waves were travelling from the west -northwest.

 Report 12 -201  
At 1am 15 March the cold front was near the north of Stewart Island. The wind in the vicinity of the north 
coast of Stewart Island was blowing from the west -northwest at about 25 to 30 knots. The significant wave 
height of waves was between 3 and 3.5 metre s with higher waves near the west coast of Stewart Island, 
and isolated waves of 5 metres. Visibility would have been restricted by the moderate to heavy rain that 
was falling.    

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 57 >>
  
At 2am 15 March the cold front was close to Puysegur Point, over Ruapuke  Island but not yet reached 
Centre Island which was recording 35 knots from the northwest. The wind had probably eased to 20 knots 
from west or southwest in the vicinity of the north coast of Stewart Island. Wave heights were probably still 
in the range 3 to 3.5 metres with isolated waves 5 metres high. Visibility was being reduced by the 
moderate rain that was still falling.

Station plotting model   
The triangle is plotted at the station location.  
Wind is represented by a stylised arrow that flies with the wind. In this case the arrow is pointing from the 
north -northwest (towards the south -southeast). The flights of the arrow tail indicate the wind speed. Full 
lines represent 10's of knots and a hal f-line, 5 knots. In this example the wind speed is 45 knots (to the 
neatest 5 knots).  
The figures to the left of the station symbol (upper and lower) are the air temperature and dew point, 
respectively, in degrees Celsius.  
The figure to the upper right i s the barometric pressure in tenths of a hectopascals with the hundreds and 
thousands digits omitted. Here, "163" means 1016.3 hPa.  
The figure to the lower right is the hourly rainfall in tenths of a millimetre. Here, "0008" means 0.8 mm.

 Combined wave height and direction analysis for midnight 14/15 March 2012 NZST  
 
The combined wave height is the heigh t of the combination together of  wind waves and swell waves. 
Heights of wave sets combine in proportion to the energy of the waves which is in proportion to the square 
of the wave height. Like the hypotenuse rule, the square of the height of th e combined waves is equal to 
the sum of the squares of the heights of the individual wave sets.

inclining test, conducted or witnessed by a surveyor recognised for that purpose by the Director 
under rule 46.29, in the following circumstances - 
(a) where it is a new ship, upon its completion; or  
(b) where  alterations made to an existing ship, which has previously been subject to an inclining 
test, result in a deviation of the lightship weight exceeding 2 per cent; or  
(c) where it is an existing ship, which has not previously been subject to an inclining t est, in which 
case it must be inclined before the date which is two years after the date on which this Part 
comes into force.  
(2) On completion of the inclining test the surveyor referred to in rule 40D.33(1) must -  
(a) determine the actual displacement and position of the centre of gravity for the lightship 
condition; and  
(b) produce righting lever curves (GZ curves) for the following conditions:  
(i) departure for the fishing grounds with full fuel, stores, ice, and fishing gear; and  
(ii) departure from t he fishing grounds with full catch; and  
(iii) arrival at home port with full catch and 10 per cent fuel and stores; and  
(iv) arrival at home port with 10 per cent fuel, stores, and a minimum catch, that is normally 
to be 20 per cent of a full catch but m ay be up to 40 per cent, provided the surveyor is 
satisfied that operating patterns justify such a value; and  
(v) any other actual operating conditions the surveyor considers would produce the lowest 
values of the parameters contained in the criteria requ ired by rule 40D.33(2)(d); and  
(c) in determining the righting lever curves (GZ curves), take into account the following:  
(i) allowance for the weight of wet fishing nets and other fishing gear on the deck; and  
(ii) homogeneous distribution of the catch , unless this is inconsistent with practice; and  
(iii) catch on deck, if anticipated, in operating conditions referred to in rules 
40D.33(2)(b)(ii),(iii), and (v); and  
(iv) water ballast if carried; and  
(v) allowance  for the free surface effect of liquids and, if applicable, catch carried; and  
(vi) where a ship operates in areas where ice accretion is likely to occur, make the following 
icing allowance:  
(aa) 30 kg/m2 on exposed weather decks and gangways; and  
(bb) 7.5 kg/rn2 for projected lateral area of each side of the ship above the water 
plane; and  
(cc) the projected lateral area of discontinuous surfaces of rail, spars (except masts) 
and rigging of ships having no sails and the projected lateral area of other small 
objects must be computed by increasing the total projected area of continuous 
surfaces by 50 per cent and the static moments of this area by 10 per cent; and

heel of 30° and 40° or between 30° and Θ f if this angle is less than 40° must not be 
less than 0.03 metre -radians.  Θ f is the angle of heel at which openings in the hull,

referred to in rule 40D.33(1) must be satisfied that the stability criteria given in rule 4 0D.33(2)(d) 
are maintained in all operating conditions.  
(4) The surveyor referred to in rule 40D.33(1), taking account of the seasonal weather conditions, the 
sea states in which the ship will operate, the type of ship, and its mode of operation, must be 
satisfied that a ship is able to withstand -  
(a) the effect of severe wind and rolling in associated sea conditions; and  
(b) the effect of water on deck.

to the Director. The stability information must - 
(a)  be supp lied to the owner by the surveyor; and  
(b) must enable the master to assess with ease and certainty the stability of the ship under 
various operating conditions; and  
(c) include specific instructions to the master regarding those operating conditions tha t could 
adversely affect either the stability or trim of the ship.

with rule 40D.33(5) is -  
(a) kept on board the ship, and readily accessible at all times; and  
(b) if alterations are made to the ship, to the extent defined in rule 40D.33(1)(b), revised to the 
satisfaction of a surveyor recognised for that purpose by the Director under rule 46.29.  
40D.34 Ships of less than 24 metres in length  
(1) The owner of a ny new ship of 12 metres or more in length, but less than 24 metres in length that is 
engaged in trawling, dredging, or similar forms of fishing where heavy gear is towed, or is engaged 
in purse seining, must ensure that the ship is subject, upon its compl etion, to an inclining test 
conducted or witnessed by a surveyor recognised for that purpose by the Director under rule 
46.29.  
                                                        
7 In applying this criterion, small openings through which progressive flooding cannot take place need not be 
considered as open.

<< Page 65 >>
 (2) On completion of the inclining test, the surveyor referred to in rule 40D.34(1) must -  
(a) determine the actual displacement an d position of the centre of gravity for the lightship 
condition; and  
(b) produce righting lever curves (GZ curves) for the conditions listed in rule 40D.33(2)(b), taking 
into account the factors listed in rule 40D.33(2)(c)(i) to (vi) inclusive; and  
(c) confirm that the righting lever curves for the conditions required by rule 40D.33(2)(b) meet the 
criteria given in rule 40D.33(2)(d); and  
(d) prepare  stability information in a form prescribed by the Director, which must be kept by the 
owner and made available on request to a surveyor or the Director.  
(3) The owner of any new ship of 12 metres or more in length, but less than 24 metres in length that is 
not engaged in purse seining or forms of fishing using heavy towed gear must ensure that the ship 
is subject, upon its completion, to an inclining test conducted or witnessed by a surveyor 
recognised for that purpose by the Director under rule 46.29.  
(4) On co mpletion of the inclining test required by rule 40D.34(3), the surveyor referred to in rule 
40D.34(1) must -  
(a) determine the actual displacement and position of the centre of gravity for the lightship 
condition; and  
(b) produce righting lever curves fo r the ship in the following conditions:  
(i) departure for the fishing grounds with full fuel, stores, ice, and fishing gear; and  
(ii) arrival at home port with full catch and 10 per cent fuel and stores; and  
(c) confirm that the righting lever curves fo r the load conditions of rule 40D.34(4)(b) meet the 
criteria of rule 40D.33(2)(d); and  
(d) prepare stability information in a form prescribed by the Director, which must be kept by the 
owner and made available on request to a surveyor or the Director.  
(5) The owner of any new ship of less than 12 metres in length that is engaged in fishing operations 
using towed gear must ensure that the ship, either -  
(a) complies with the requirements of rules 40D.34(3) and 40D.34(4); or  
(b) is subject, on completion, to an inclining test conducted or witnessed by a surveyor recognised 
for that purpose by the Director under rule 46.29. On completion of that inclining test, that 
surveyor must confirm that the metacentric height of the ship for the departure for the fishing 
grounds condition with full fuel, stores, ice, and fishing gear is not less than 0.75 metres.  
(6) Any new non -decked ship or new partially decked ship must be fitted with buoyancy compartments 
distributed so that the ship will stay afloat and in good trim, wi thout listing if flooded. This buoyancy 
must be demonstrated by -  
(a) calculation, using the following formula:  
Buoyancy (litres) = Hull (kgs) + Equipment (kgs) + Motor (kgs) + 250M  where M = 0.1 x L x B L = 
length overall B = maximum beam  
For a wooden ship, the calculations may take into account half the volume of buoyancy of wood; or  
(b) completing the following practical test:  
The ship must be loaded with a simulation of the equipment and motor weights plus 250M kgs and 
then be flooded to th e point of submergence. The ship must then bear a weight of 15 kgs on the 
gunwhale amidships on one side of the ship without capsizing.  
(7) The cockpit of any new ship to which this rule applies must be watertight and self - draining. The 
ship must have a rese rve of buoyancy and its static stability must remain intact when the cockpit is 
full of water. With the boat upright and at its deepest load draught, the cockpit must be capable of 
self-draining in 3 minutes.  
(8) The owner of any existing ship of 12 metres or  more in length, but less than 24 metres in length, 
that is engaged in trawling, dredging, or other forms of fishing where the heavy gear is towed, or 
engaged in purse seining, must ensure that the ship complies with the requirements of rules 
 

<< Page 66 >>
 Report 12 -201 40D.34(1) and  40D.34(2) from the day which is two years after the day on which this Part comes 
into force.  
(9) The owner of any existing ship of less than 12 metres in length that is engaged in fishing 
operations using towed gear, must ensure that the ship complies with t he requirements of rule 
40D.34(5) from the day which is two years after the day on which this Part comes into force.  
40D.35 Freeboard  
(1) The surveyor must be satisfied that the bow height of any ship to which rules 40D.33, 40D.34(1), 
40D34(3) and 40D.34(5) apply is sufficient to prevent the excessive shipping of water. In 
determining the sufficiency of bow height the surveyor must take into account - 
(a) the seasonal weather conditions; and  
(b) the sea states in which the ship will operate; and  
(c) the typ e of ship; and  
(d) its mode of operation.  
(2) For any ship to which rules 40D.33, 40D.34(1), and 40D.34(5) apply, a maximum permissible 
operating draught, and if appropriate a maximum permissible trim, must be approved by the 
surveyor referred to in rules 40D.33, 40D.34(1) and 40D.34(5) in accordance with rules 40D.35(3) 
and (4).  
(3) A maximum permissible operating draught, and if applicable maximum permissible trim, must be —  
(a) such that in the associated operating condition, the stability criteria of rule 40D.33(2)(d) are 
satisfied in the case of any  ship to which rules 40D.33 and 40D.34(1) apply, and the scantling 
draught is not exceeded; and  
(b) clearly noted in the stability information required by rules 40D.33(5) and 40D.34(2)(d); and  
(c) posted up in the wheelhouse, in a prominent position, cle arly visible to the master and crew of 
the ship.  
(4) Each ship for which a maximum permissible operating draught is approved by a surveyor must be 
marked with a load line amidships, port and starboard. Where a maximum permissible trim by the 
stern is also app roved by the surveyor, a load line must be marked on the transom or stern of the 
ship to indicate the maximum permissible submergence of the transom or stern at that position. 
Load lines must be 300 mm long by 30 mm deep permanently marked and painted ligh t on dark 
background or dark on light background. The upper edge of the load line must coincide with the 
maximum permissible operating draught.  
(5) Rules 40D.35(2), (3) and (4) shall not apply to an existing ship until the date two years after the 
date Part 4 0D comes into force.  
(6) For any non -decked ship or partially -decked ship to which rule 40D.34(6) applies, the freeboard 
when loaded with 250M kgs (as defined in rule 40D.34(6)) must not be less than 0.5 metres for a 
ship permitted to operate in the inshore l imit and 0.35 metres for a ship permitted to operate in 
enclosed waters.  
(7) For any ship fitted with a cockpit and to which rule 40D.34(7) applies the freeboard measured from 
the designed waterline for the maximum load to the lowest point of the cockpit sole  must not be 
less than 0.2 metres.

practices related to small fishing vessel stability ", published 
by the Food and Agricultur e Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO)  
DISPLACEMENT  
Archimedes principle: Every floating body displaces its own weight of the liquid in which it floats.  
For a vessel to float freely in water, the weight of the vessel must be equal to the weight of the volume of 
water it displaces.  
Displacement  is the volume of water the vessel displaces.  
DRAUGHT  
Draught relates to the depth of water required for a vessel to float freely and is measured vertically from 
the underneath side of the keel to the waterline.  
FREEBOARD  
Freeboard is the vertical distance from the top of the lowest point of the working deck at the side of the 
vessel to the waterline.

 Report 12 -201 LIGHT SHIP WEIGHT  
The light ship weight is the actual weight of a vessel when complete and ready for service but empty.  
 
DEADWEIGHT  
 
Deadweight is  the actual amount of weight in tonnes that a vessel can carry when loaded to the maximum 
permissible draught (includes fuel, fresh water, gear supplies, catch and crew).  
DISPLACEMENT MASS  
 
Displacement mass is the total weight of the vessel, i.e.:  
Lightship weight + deadweight = displacement mass  
  

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 69 >>
 LIST 
A vessel is said to be listed when it is 
inclined by forces within the vessel, e.g. 
movement of weight within the vessel.  
A list reduces the stability of the vessel.  
When a list is corrected by incr easing the 
displacement mass, the additional 
weight should be  
placed as low as possible in the vessel.  
 
 
 
HEEL  
A ves sel is said to be heeled when it is inclined by an external force, e.g. from waves or the wind.  
GRAVITY  
"What goes up must come down".  Th row a ball in the air. It soon comes back down in response to the 
earth's gravitational pull.  
  

 

<< Page 70 >>
 Report 12 -201 CENTRE OF GRAVITY  
Centre of gravity is the point ( G) at which the whole weight of a body can be said to act vertically 
downwards.   
 
The centre of gravity depends upon weight distribution within the vessel and its position may be found by 
carrying out an inclining test or by calculation. The  position of the centre of gravity ( G) is measured 
vertically from a reference point, usually th e keel of the vessel ( K). This distance is called KG. 
BUOYANCY  
If a ball is pushed underwater it will soon bob up again. This force is called buoyancy.  When a vessel floats 
freely, its buoyancy is equal to its displacement mass (refer to Archimedes princ iple on 
<< page 54 >>
). 

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 71 >>
 
CENTRE OF BUOYANCY  
The centre of buoyancy ( B) is the point through which the force of buoyancy is considered to act vertically 
upwards. It is located at the geometric centre of the underwater section of the vessel.   
When the shape of the hull of a vessel is known, the designer, often a naval architect, can calculate the 
centre of buoyancy ( B) for the various combinations of displacement, trim and heel.  
TRANSVERSE STABILITY  
When a vessel is floating upright (at 
equilibrium) in still wa ter, the centre 
of buoyancy (upthrust) and the 
centre of gravity (downthrust) will be 
on the same line, vertically above 
the keel ( K). 
 
If the vessel is inclined by an external force (i.e. without 
moving internal weight) a wedge of buoyancy is brought out  
of the water on one side and a similar wedge of buoyancy 
is immersed on the other side. The centre of buoyancy 
being the centre of the underwater section of the vessel 
has now moved from point B to B1. 
METACENTRE  
Vertical lines drawn from the centre of 
buoyancy at consecutive small angles of 
heel will intersect at a point called the 
metacentre ( M).  The metacentre can be 
considered as being similar to a pivot 
point when a vessel is inclined at small 
angles of heel.  The height of the 
metacentre is measure d from the 
reference point ( K) and is, therefore, 
called KM. 

 

<< Page 72 >>
 Report 12 -201 WHY A FISHING VESSEL REMAINS UPRIGHT  
Another way of understanding how a fishing vessel stays upright is to imagine the rocking of a baby cradle, 
as shown in the figure. The fishing vessel (weight ) is represented by the cradle and its centre of gravity ( G) 
is the near the centre of the cradle. The "buoyant force" supporting the cradle is represented by the rocker 
resting on the floor and the centre of buoyancy ( B) is the point where rocker contacts  the floor.  
As with a fishing vessel, the cradle's (vessel's) centre of gravity ( G) is above its rocker, the centre of 
buoyancy ( B). The slightest disturbance (wind or waves) causes the cradle (vessel) to roll (heel) to one side.   
As the cradle (vessel) r olls to one side, the point where the rocker touches the floor (the centre of buoyancy 
(B)) shifts outboard. To keep the cradle (vessel) upright, the point where the rocker touches the floor (the 
centre of buoyancy ( B)) must shift outboard. It is this shif ting of the centre of buoyancy ( B) that allows a 
fishing vessel to return to upright after being heeled by an external force. 
 
  

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 73 >>
 
EQUILIBRIUM  
A vessel is said to be in stable equilibrium if, 
when inclined, it tends to return to the 
upright. For this to occur the centre of gravity 
(G) must be below the metacentre ( M). 
 
 
 
METACENTRIC HEIGHT  
The distance between G and M is known as the metacentric height ( GM). A stable vessel when upright is 
said to have a positive metacentric height ( GM), i.e. when the metacentre ( M) is found to be above the 
centre of gravity ( G). This is usually referred to as having a positive GM or a positive initial stability.  
 
UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM  
If the centre of gravity ( G) of a vessel is above 
the metacentre ( M) the vessel is sa id to have a 
negative GM or a negative initial stability. A 
vessel in this state has a loll, i.e. it floats at an 
angle from the upright to one side or the other 
and there is a danger that it may capsize.  
NEUTRAL EQUILIBRIUM  
When the position of a vessel 's centre of 
gravity ( G) and the metacentre ( M) coincide 
the vessel is said to be in neutral equilibrium 
(Zero GM ) and if inclined to a small angle of 
heel it will tend to remain at that angle.  
  

 

<< Page 74 >>
 Report 12 -201 
RIGHTING LEVER   
When heeled by an external force, the 
vesse l's centre of gravity ( G), which is 
unaffected by the heel and the weight (of 
the vessel), is considered to act vertically 
downward through G. The centre of 
buoyancy ( B) (being the geometric centre 
of the underwater section) has moved to a 
new position B1 and the force of buoyancy 
(equal to the weight of water being 
displaced) is considered to act vertically 
up through the new centre of buoyancy 
B1.  
The horizontal distance from the centre of gravity ( G) to the vertical line from B1 is called the righting l ever. 
This distance can be measured and is usually referred to as GZ. 
Therefore, the force involved in returning the vessel to the upright position is the weight of the vessel acting 
down through the centre of gravity ( G) multiplied by the righting lever ( GZ). This is referred to as the 
moment of statical stability.  
The vessel's centre of gravity ( G) has a 
distinct effect on the righting lever ( GZ) 
and consequently the ability of a vessel 
to return to the upright position. The 
lower the centre of gravity ( G), the bigger 
is the righting lever ( GZ). 
Should the vessel's centre of gravity ( G) 
be near the metacentre ( M) the vessel 
will have only a small metacentric height 
(GM) and the righting lever ( GZ) will also 
be a small value. Therefore, the moment 
of stati cal stability to return the vessel to 
the upright position will be considerably less than that of the previous illustration.   

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 75 >>
 STABILITY CURVES (GZ CURVES)   
Stability curves ( GZ curves) are used to show graphically the stability levers ( GZ) exerted by a vessel to 
return itself to a position of equilibrium from the various conditions of heel. The curves have several 
general characteristics and the following factors should be observed:  
a) the metacentric height ( GM); 
b) (b) the maximum value of the righting lever  (GZ); and  
c) (c) the point of vanishing stability.  
The shape of the righting lever curves is dependent on the form of the vessel's hull and its loading. The 
shape of the curve at small angles of heel generally follows the slope of the line plotted to the ini tial 
metacentric height (GM). In this regard, the freeboard and the ratio between the vessel's breadth and 
depth are also very important.  
Raising the vessel's centre of gravity ( G) causes a decrease in the metacentric height ( GM) and thereby 
smaller value s of the righting levers ( GZ). 
  

 

<< Page 76 >>
 Report 12 -201 If the vessel's centre of gravity ( G) is above the metacentre ( M), the vessel is in an unstable equilibrium. 
The vessel has a negative GM and is not able to float upright. Either the vessel will capsize of or float at an 
angle from the upright to one side. (See also the section on loll on 
<< page 73 >>
).   
By loading less the vessel will have more freeboard and the values of the righting lever ( GZ) will, in general, 
be higher. The point of vanishing stability will also be higher , i.e. the vessel's ability to return to upright after 
having been heeled to large angles of heel is better.  
The hull form of a vessel is an important factor in determining the characteristics of its stability. Increased 
breadth (beam) will result in high er values for metacentric heights ( GM) and righting levers ( GZ). However, 
the point of vanishing stability  will be less, i.e. the vessel will capsize at a smaller  angle of heel.   
  

 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 77 >>
 DYNAMIC STABILITY  
This is the stability characteristic of the vessel when moving (particularly rolling) and is the energy 
necessary to incline a vessel to a certain angle of heel and thereby counteract the moment of statical 
stability . 
The dynamic stability may be determined by measuring the area under the righting lever curve ( GZ curve) 
up to a certain angle of heel. The larger the area, the better is the dynamic stability.  
Waves are the most common external force that causes a vessel to heel. Steep waves with short 
wavelengths, particularly breaking waves, are the most dangerou s to small vessels.  
The relationship between a vessel's dynamic stability and wave energy is complex and is, for example, 
dependent on the speed and course of the vessel in relation to the speed and direction of the wave. 
However, in general, the smaller t he vessels, the smaller the waves they are able to cope with.  
The skipper should keep himself informed on weather forecasts in order to have sufficient time to 
avoid any weather conditions that could threaten the safety of his vessel.

 Report 12 -201 Appendix 4 Easy Rider  hydrostatic model and stability calculation  
Origin of the model  
A4.1 The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (the Commission) was unable to locate the as -
built plans and other hydrostatic data for the Easy Rider  itself, to use as a basis for calcu lating 
the Easy Rider 's stability. The stability profile presented below is the result of calculations made 
using an estimated hydrostatic model. The model was estimated using hydrostatic data available 
from other vessels built to the same design.  
Hull-form 
A4.2 The Commission  had access to a copy of the original lines plan for a sister vessel. Th is lines plan 
was used to develop a hull -form.  A naval a rchitect took a set of hull -form measurements from 
another sister vessel and also performed a test to determin e its ve rtical centre of gravity.  The 
naval a rchitect made the data available to the Commission  and it was used to verify the 
hydrostatic model. Another naval a rchitect had performed similar tests on another sister vessel ; 
that data was also used to verif y the model.  
Uncertainty  
A4.3 The various "Owenga " class vessels were built in different geographical locations at different 
times over several years. The first was launched in the late 1960s.  Owing  to the nature of 
shipbuilding , the characteristics of individ ual vessels would vary from the design. No two vessels 
would be identical, and some could  deviate significantly from the design. The variation s in 
hydrostatic characteristics between vessels built to the same design mean that the hydrostatic 
data used in this report may differ  from that of the Easy Rider .  
Vessel weights ' estimate  
The weights accounted for in this report are outlined as follows.  
Weight name  Description  Origin of data  
Lightship weight  The weight of the vessel in 
ready -for-service but empty 
condition. For example , no fuel 
or fresh  water, no cargo, no 
fishing bait/ice/catch on  board.  The lightship weight and vertical 
centre of gravity used in the 
model were  taken from a naval 
architect 's report on a sister 
vesse l. 
Fuel tanks  As per fuel tanks given in the 
design of a sister vessel.  Volume and location derived 
from interviews and a naval 
architect's  report on  a sister 
vessel . 
Vessel stores  Stores related to the fishing 
vessel, not the muttonbird ers. Weight and location estimated 
from naval architect 's report . 
Fresh water drum A drum used to carry fresh 
water for the vessel crew, not 
the passengers . Volume and location estimated 
from photographs and interview 
records . 
Vessel crew The crew of the vessel not 
including the passenger s. Weights estimated from autopsy 
report . 
Location estimated from 
interview with survivor.  
Fishing load The load on  board the vessel 
related to fishing operations, for 
example c od and cray  pots.  Weight est imated from records . 
Location estimated from 
photographs and interview 
records.  
Ice/Bait  Fishing bait and ice.  Weight and location estimated 
 
Report 12 -201 
<< Page 79 >>
 from naval architect 's reports 
on a sister vessel.  
Cargo  Includes the total weight due to 
the carriage of the passengers  
and their cargo.  
Includes the weight of 
passengers and their personal 
effects  and food, and also the 
equipment, raw materials  and 
consumables they were taking 
to Big South Cape Island . The w eight s and location s of the 
passengers were  estimated 
from interview and autopsy 
report s. 
The w eight s and location s of 
their equipment etc . were 
estimated from photogra phs, 
pre-departure and interview 
records.  
Load cases  
Three load cases were considered:  
1. the stability for the vessel in a 50 percent loaded co ndition.  Considered to be the load 
case in which  the vessel probably spent most of its working life, with 50 percent fuel, 
water ice, bait and catch and a crew of 3  
2. estimated typical departure from Bluff on a fishing voyage, with full fuel tanks, water, 
ice and bait, vessel stores and provisions and a crew of 3  
3. estimation of the Easy Rider 's loading as the vessel left port on 15 March. Similar to 
load case 2 but with the addition of the 6 passengers and their equipment and stores.  
Stability  
Results given include primary hydrostatic data and GZ curve up to 70 degrees.
