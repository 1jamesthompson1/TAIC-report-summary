Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Catastrophic engine failure: The report identifies that the failure of the connecting rod assembly and the subsequent failure of the connecting rod bolts led to the catastrophic engine failure. The severity of the damage to engine components made it difficult to determine the root cause of the failure.
2. Localized overheating: The report suggests that local overheating caused by fluctuating lubricating oil and cooling water pressures due to engine-handling technique could not be excluded as a possible cause of the engine failure. Similarities in the failure of another engine of the same type support this possibility.
3. Maintenance practices: The report highlights that the engine had run for 6000 hours since its last overhaul, which was shorter than the recommended interval for overhaul. The timing and quality of maintenance were not established as contributing factors to the engine failure, but it was unclear why the manufacturer recommended a shorter interval for overhaul.
