Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Catastrophic engine failure: The report identifies that the failure of the engine connecting rod assembly is a common cause of catastrophic engine failure. In this case, the failure occurred when the connecting rod bolts failed in overload, leading to severe damage to the engine components.

2. Maintenance regime: The report highlights that the maintenance regime followed by Fullers did not correspond to the engine manufacturer's recommended maintenance program. There was a discrepancy between Fullers' extended replacement program and the manufacturer's recommended interval for bearing replacement. The report suggests that the timing or quality of maintenance may have contributed to the engine failure.

3. Lubrication and cooling: The report discusses the role of lubrication and cooling in engine failure. It mentions that a reduction in flow of cooling water or lubricating oil can result in overheating or localized overheating of the engine. The report also notes that the lubricating oil analysis program did not detect any significant deterioration in the engine condition, but the lubricating oil was within normal parameters.

4. Emergency response: The report evaluates the emergency response to the engine failure and identifies two safety issues. Firstly, only half of the fixed CO2 fire-suppression system was released into the engine room, which may not have been sufficient to extinguish a sustained fire. Secondly, the procedure for abandoning ship when another vessel is involved was not documented or practiced during evacuation drills.

5. Ship-to-ship passenger transfer: The report suggests that in the congested Hauraki Gulf, it is highly likely that abandoning ship would involve a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers and crew. The report recommends including this scenario in emergency response training and drills, as well as considering design changes to facilitate ship-to-ship passenger transfers.

6. Root cause determination: The report acknowledges that due to the severity of the damage to engine components, it was not possible to determine the exact root cause of the failure. However, it suggests that localised overheating caused by fluctuating lubricating oil and cooling water pressures could not be excluded as a contributing factor.
