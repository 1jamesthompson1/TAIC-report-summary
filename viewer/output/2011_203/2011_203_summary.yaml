  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue management contributing to the accident within the provided document.

    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Human error played a role in the emergency response, where "the engineer only fired the starboard CO2 bottle into the engine room because he associated the failure of the starboard engine with that of the catamaran configuration, forgetting that both engines were in fact in the same space" (4.4.4). This error could have had serious consequences if a sustained fire had occurred.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no direct evidence in the document that suggests a lack of training and competency contributed to the accident.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The engineer's mistake in releasing only one of the two required CO2 cylinders suggests a lack of familiarity with the mono-hull vessel's fire-suppression system, which differs from the catamaran-style vessels in the fleet (4.4.4).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that crew resource management was a contributing factor to the accident.

- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The emergency response was generally well-executed, but the error in releasing only one CO2 bottle indicates a potential gap in preparedness for dealing with engine room fires on mono-hull vessels (4.4.4).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 70
  explanation: The document indicates that the engine failed after running for 6000 hours since its last overhaul, and the engine manufacturer had recommended reducing the interval between overhauls from 16,000 to 6000 hours for vessels operating similarly to the Jet Raider (5.3). Although it was not clear if Fullers' deviation from the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule contributed to the engine failure, the timing aligns with the recommended maintenance interval (4.3.10, 4.3.11).
- name: Use of Automation

  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that communication breakdown was a factor in the accident.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The "Other" category is assigned to account for the possibility of factors not covered by the provided safety themes. The document suggests that the exact cause of the engine failure could not be determined due to the severity of the damage (5.2). Additionally, there were similarities in the failure of this and another engine of the same type that could not be excluded as contributing factors (5.2). This category acknowledges the potential for unidentified or unexplored factors that may have contributed to the accident.
