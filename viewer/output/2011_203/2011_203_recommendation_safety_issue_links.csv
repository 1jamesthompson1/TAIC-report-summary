2011_203,027/13,the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Auckland Council that he co-ordinates the ferry companies that operate large passenger ferries on the major Hauraki Gulf routes to adopt ferry design features and training programmes aimed at minimising the risk of a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers when the need arises to abandon a passenger ferry.,"Most of the Fullers vessels operate in enclosed or inshore limits, and in areas frequently plied by other ferries and recreational vessels. In the past 10 years there have been a number of incidents and accidents involving passenger ferries in the Auckland area, and on almost every occasion the passengers have not needed to enter life-rafts. Instead they have been transferred to other vessels in the vicinity.

Although passenger transfer is the more likely method for abandoning ship in the congested Hauraki Gulf, the crews do not practise transferring passengers from one vessel to another, nor do they practise bringing one vessel alongside another. The vessels in Fullers' fleet have subtly different heights of rubbing strips, and access and egress points. There would be merit in introducing this into the training schedule, and also merit in considering subtle design changes to better facilitate ship-to-ship passenger transfers.

On 16 December 2013 ","A clear placard should be placed at the control station for the fixed CO2 fire-suppression systems on all passenger ferries, alerting them to the exact number of CO2 bottles needed to extinguish a fire in each of the protected compartments.

On 16 December 2013 ","When an accident or incident occurs that requires a passenger ferry operating in Auckland's congested Hauraki Gulf to abandon ship, it is highly likely that this will be achieved by a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers and crew. This scenario should be included in emergency response training and drills, and passenger ferries from all companies operating in the same area should be designed to minimise the risks of such an operation.
