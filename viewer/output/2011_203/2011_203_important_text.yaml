  \ failure can have serious consequences.  Crew in the engine room at the \ntime\
  \ are at risk of injury from flying debris, and in some circumstances it can result\
  \ in a fire if \nthe lubricating or fuel oil systems are damaged and oil sprays\
  \ on to hot surfaces.  \n4.1.2.  In this case the engine room was normally unmanned,\
  \ with most engine monitoring done \nremotely using gauges and closed -circuit television.\
  \  The likelihood of injury occurring was \ntherefore low.  \n4.1.3.  Also, in this\
  \ case , no fire occurred.  The ini tial indications of fire were likely caused\
  \ by steam \nfrom the cooling water system  that was damaged by flying debris ,\
  \ and escaping exhaust gases \nand unburned fuel from the damaged engine.   It is\
  \ possible that there was a momentary \n\"flash -off\" of this gaseo us mixture.\
  \  \n4.1.4.  The initiating cause of catastrophic engine failure is often difficult\
  \ to determine due to the \nresulting damage .  It can be difficult to distinguish\
  \ damage that might have initiated the event \nfrom damage caused by  the resulting\
  \ failure sequenc e.  This failure is one such case.  \n4.1.5.  The following analysis\
  \ discusses the potential causes of the engine failure .  Two safety issues \nare\
  \ also discussed:  \n\uF0B7 the maintenance regime that Fullers follow ed did  not\
  \ correspond to W\xE4rtsil\xE4's (the engine \nmanufacturer 's) recommended maintenance\
  \ program me, but also W\xE4rtsil\xE4  would not \nexplain the rationale behind\
  \ its recommended maintenance program me \n\uF0B7 the system of transferring passengers\
  \ to another vessel as a means of evacuation was not \ndocumented or practi sed\
  \ during evacu ation drills.  \n4.2. Possible failure sequence  \n4.2.1.  The f\
  \ ailure of a n engine  connecting rod assembly is one common cause of catastrophic\
  \ engine \nfailure.  The connecting rod s in this case failed when the connecting\
  \ rod bolts clamping the \nbig-end of the connecting rod t o the crankshaft failed\
  \  in overload.  \n4.2.2.  In his submission on the draft final report , one interested\
  \ person from the operator identified \nseveral failure mechanisms that could have\
  \ initiated or contributed to the engine failure , such \nas stretch in the connecting\
  \ rod bolts and stress cracks developing in and around a piston \nassembly.  None\
  \ of these factors could be excluded, but due to the severity of the total \ndamage\
  \ sustained in the catastrophic failure it is difficult to determine if any of these\
  \ fact ors \ndirectly contributed to the failure.  \n4.2.3.  Similarly, t he Defence\
  \ Technology A gency report into the fa ilure ( see Appendix 2 for the full \nreport\
  \ ) outlined 2 possible failure sequences based on the available evidence , but\
  \ its \ninvestigation was unable to identify  positively  which  factor initiated\
  \ the failure sequence . \n4.2.4.  For e ach of the 2 possible failure sequences\
  \ the outcome was the same - there was an \nincrease in the clearances in the big\
  \ -end bearings where the connecting rods were  connected \nto the cranksh aft.\
  \  This increase in clearances causes minor shock loading within the \nbearings,\
  \ which can lead to failure of the connecting rod bolts.  The f ailure of the connecting\
  \ \nrod bolts allows the big-end of the connecting ro ds to open and the connecting\
  \ rod is th rown \noff the rotating crankshaft with considerable force.  The resultant\
  \ massive imbalance in the \nengine can cause other components to fail as well.\
  \  One possible scenario is where clamping \nforce  on the bearing s is lost due\
  \ to  a loosening of the connecting  rod bolts .  The other is where  \nthe bearings\
  \ become worn .  The result in either case was increased clearances within the \n\
  bearing assembly.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report 11 -203 4.2.5.  A loss of\
  \ clamping force itself can cause the bearing to wear prematurely, so factors from\
  \ both \nscenarios can overlap to contribute to  the same outcome, making it difficult\
  \ to determine \nwhich occurred first.  \n4.2.6.  A loss of clamping force by the\
  \ upper connecting ro d bolt would allow fretting7 at the upper \nmulti -v joint\
  \ between the connecting rod and the connecting rod cap.  \n4.2.7.  A loss of clamping\
  \ force can be caused by under -torqueing8 the connecting rod bolt during \nmaintenance.\
  \  Conversely, over -torqueing a connecting r od bolt can weaken the bolt, causing\
  \ \nit to fail at lower forces.  However, failure due to either type of maintenance\
  \ error usually \nshows up earlier in the engine life.  In this case the engine\
  \ had run for more than  6000 hours \nsince being rebuilt (when the bolts would\
  \ have been last torqued).  \n4.2.8.  The white metal surface s of the big-end bearings\
  \ for the Number 4 pistons were  severely \nworn, and overheating had caused the\
  \ white metal surface s to extrude out of the immediate \nbearing area.   This type\
  \ of damage could have initiated the connecting rod failure, or equally it \ncould\
  \ have been a result of the failure.  \n4.2.9.  If the  big-end b earing s had been\
  \  worn prior to failure this would have result ed in increased \nclearances within\
  \ the connecting rod  assembly, which  as mentioned  can lead to minor shock \n\
  loading of the bearing, possibly leading to  connecting rod bolt failure . \n4.2.10.\
  \  Other factors that can lead to bearing wear include : \n\uF0B7 bearing cavitation\
  \  \n\uF0B7 corrosive wear  \n\uF0B7 a previous overheating incident  \n\uF0B7 fuel\
  \ dilution   \n\uF0B7 contamination of the lubricating oil  \n\uF0B7 lubricating\
  \ oil starvation . \n \n                                                       \

  << Page 13 >>\n 4.2.11.  Cavitation, corrosive wear or a previous overheating of\
  \ the number 4  big-end bearings could \nnot be ruled out because any evidence was\
  \ masked by  damage sustained during the failure \nsequence.  \n4.2.12.  The damaged\
  \ Number 4A piston showed possible pisto n scuff marks9 on one side  (see Figure\
  \ \n8).  Piston scuffing is usually caused by either a lack of lubrication between\
  \ moving metal \nparts or a lack of cooling .  Localised heating can cause engine\
  \  parts to weld together \nmomentarily before breaking free.  This momentary welding\
  \ can put excessive strain on the \nconnecting rod bolts , leading to their eventual\
  \ failure.   However, considerable damage to both \nthe cylinder liner and piston\
  \ made it difficult to determin e whether the scuff mark s had been  \npresent before\
  \ the engine failure or whether t hey were incurred when the engine failed . \n\
  Lubrication  and cooling  \n4.2.13.  Engine cooling is achieved by both cooling\
  \ water circulating through the engine and cooling by \nthe lubricating oil.  A\
  \ reduction in flow of either can result in an overheating of the engine , or \n\
  localised overheating . \n4.2.14.  Apart from the big -end bearings for Number 4\
  \ piston s, the components in the rest of the \nengine were relatively undamaged\
  \ and in good condition, meaning that the engine as a whole \nhad not been starved\
  \ of lubricating oil.  \n4.2.15.  Fullers used systematic monitoring of engine lubricating\
  \ oil as part of its engine monitoring \nand maintenance program me.  The previous\
  \ lubricating oil test reports for the failed engine \nhad not show n any evidence\
  \ of fuel dilution or other abnormal  contamination of the \nlubricating oil, so\
  \ oil quality did not appear to be an issue.  \n4.2.16.  Both the lube oil and cooling\
  \ water pumps on the Deutz MWM engine were mechanically \ndriven directly off the\
  \ engine.  This m eant that  the flow each produced was proportional to the \nengine\
  \ revolutions.  A rapid decrease in engine revolutions results in a corresponding\
  \ sudden \ndecrease in the flow of cooling water and lubrication oil.  If the engine\
  \ has been running at \nhigh revolu tions and high temperatures , the sudden decrease\
  \ in cooling water and lubricating \noil flow can result in localised overheating.\
  \  The consequence  of this engine feature can be \nmitigated by avoiding large\
  \ , sudden changes in engine speed, which is not always possible \nwhen operating\
  \ short -range ferry operations with multiple  pick-up points, in heavily congested\
  \ \nwaters.  \n4.2.17.  There had been  another catastrophic engine failure involving\
  \ the same engine type on a \npassenger ferry operating in Fiji10.  In that case\
  \ a conne cting rod from Number 4 piston failed \nand exited through the crankcase\
  \ door in a similar way  to this engine .  The other bearings \nwere all seized\
  \ on  to the crankshaft.  \n4.2.18.  An engineer with expert knowledge of the Deutz\
  \ MWM engine conducted an investigation into  \nthe cause of the failure.  The engineer\
  \ concluded that the B4 cylinder liner and the B4 piston \nhad failed due to localised\
  \ heating.  He was of the opinion that the lubricating oil cooling jet on \nthe\
  \ underside of the piston head had been  operating correctly ; however, so much\
  \ damage had \noccurred he was unable to confirm this.  \n4.2.19.  It could be coincidental\
  \ that the same pistons and connecting rod assembly (Number 4) failed \non the same\
  \ engine type , or it could be that local overheating associated  with fluctuations\
  \ in \ncooling water and lubricating oil pressures first manifests itself within\
  \ the Number 4 piston \nassembly  on this engine type .  The scuff marks found on\
  \ the Number 4  piston s of both \nengines would support this possibility.  Regardless\
  \ of whether this was the case, operators of \nengines with direct engine -driven\
  \ cooling water and lubricating oil pumps should consider \nmodifying their operations\
  \ and driving styles to mitigate any such risk .  \n  \n                       \
  \                                 \n9 Scuffing is the process by which metals weld\
  \ themselves together and then break loose .  It is also known as \"micro \nseizure\
  \ \" or \"adhesive wear \".  Scuffing is likely to occur  when 2 moving metallic\
  \ parts lose lubrication between them.  In \nthis case the scuffing is between either\
  \ the piston or piston rings and the walls of the cylinder.  \n10 Passenger ferry\

  \ 8  \nNumber 4A piston after removal from cylinder  \n \n4.3. Maintenance  \n4.3.1.\
  \  The service and technical support functions for the Deutz MWM marine product\
  \ range had \nbeen  transferred to another manufacturer of marine diesel engines\
  \ (W\xE4rtsil\xE4) in 2005 .  Fullers \ncarried out the maintenance of the engines\
  \ itself  using W\xE4rtsil\xE4's specified maintenance \nschedule.   \n4.3.2.  W\xE4\
  rtsil\xE4 set its recommended engine maintenance into specific engine performance\
  \ groups , \ndepending on  the type of operation and the typical engine running\
  \ hours achieved each year \n(see Table 3 in Appendix 2).  When the Jet Raider \
  \ was in daily service with Fullers , its yearly \nhours would have placed it in\
  \ W\xE4rtsil\xE4's maintenance group  \"A\", which was for ves sels in \ncontinu\
  \ al operation for more than 4000 hours per year .  Fullers followed schedule A\
  \ for the \nmaintenance of all Deutz engines in its fleet , but it had extended\
  \ the 16  000-hour \nreplacement program me to 24  000 hours on the basis of its\
  \  engine lubricating oil monitoring \nprogram me used to enhance  the monitor ing\
  \ of  engine performance.  \n4.3.3.  When Fullers took the Jet Raider  out of daily\
  \ service it fell broadly into maintenance group C, \nfor vessels in restricted\
  \ operation up to 2000 hours per year .  Running hours alone was not \nthe only\
  \ factor to consider when deciding which  maintenance plan to follow.  The time\
  \ for \nwhich the engine was operating at or above 80% power was another consideration.\
  \  Taking \nboth into account it was possible that the Jet Raider  fell somewhere\
  \ in between group s A and \nC.  Findings  \n1. The engine catastrophically failed\
  \ when the bolts securing 2 connecting rods to the \nnumber 4 journal failed in\
  \ overload.  \n2. The severity of the damage to engine components meant it was not\
  \ possible to say \nwhat the root cause of the failure was.  However, similarities\
  \ in the failure of this and \nanother engine of the same type indicate that localised\
  \ overheating caused by \nfluctuating lubricating oil and cooling water pressures\
  \ due to engine -handling \ntechnique could not be excluded.  \npiston crown  \n\

  \  Engine maintenance for vessels that fell into group C was more rigorous than\
  \ that for vessels \nin group A.  For example , the W\xE4rtsil\xE4 renewal interval\
  \ for the big - and small -end bearings \nunder group A was 16  000 hours.  This\
  \ was reduced to 6000 hours for engines under group C \n(see the table on \n<< page\
  \ 5 >>\n of Appendix 2 ).  The reason for W\xE4rtsil\xE4 reducing the interval for\
  \ \nreplacement of the bearings is unclear.  Fullers had previously asked W\xE4\
  rtsil\xE4 for the reason,  \nbut W\xE4rtsil\xE4 had not respond ed.  In its submission\
  \ on the draft final report , W\xE4rtsil\xE4  said that \nit thought the maintenance\
  \ schedule may have originated when the engines were delivered \nfrom MWM/Deutz\
  \ Far East in Singapore.  As far as W\xE4rtsil\xE4  was concerned , the Fullers\
  \ \nmaintenance schedule was adequate , providing the  connecting rod bolts were\
  \ exchanged \nafter every removal.  The asset manager for Fullers Group Limited\
  \ confirmed that the \nconnecting rod bolts were changed every time the bolts were\
  \ rem oved as a matter of policy.  \n4.3.5.  Fullers took regular samples of engine\
  \ lubricating oil and sent them  to an independent oil \nanalysis company.  The\
  \ company would provide a report on each sample, which would also \ncomment on any\
  \ trend in oil condition for the same  engine.  It was then up to Fullers to use\
  \ \nthat information and decide what maintenance action to take.  \n4.3.6.  Lubricating\
  \ oil analysis is carried out to optimise the life of oil, rather than chang e it\
  \ \nunnecessarily.  I t can also be used to monitor the wear rates  of engine components\
  \ by \ndetecting and quantifying wear metal11 levels within the oil over set time\
  \ intervals.  In this way \nabnormal wear in a component can be detected before\
  \ it fails , possibly catastrophically (see \nAppendix 3).   The most recent  lubricatin\
  \ g oil analysis performed on the starboard engine had \nbeen  one month before\
  \ it failed.   \n4.3.7.  An examination of the oil analys is reports prior to the\
  \ accident on board the Jet Raider  showed \nhigher levels of contaminant elements\
  \ and wear elements in the starboard  (failed) engine \nthan in the comparative\
  \ samples for the port engine (as noted in the Defence Technology \nAgency  report).\
  \  These were , however , within the limits for what the oil analyses described\
  \ as \n\"normal condition \".   \n4.3.8.  The report from the oil analys is company\
  \ noted that the Fullers fleet in general had \nconsistently higher levels of chromium\
  \  in the lubricating oil  than the \"global population \" of \nDeutz engines under\
  \ its oil analys is program me.  The oil analys is company, however, \ncautioned\
  \ against taking any of the figures in isolation.  The figures should be considered\
  \ in \nconjunction with other wear triggers and establish whether the figures are\
  \ a one -off level or \nindicative of a developing trend.  \n4.3.9.  The lubrication\
  \ oil analysis for the starboard engine did not, in isolation , show that failure\
  \ was \ninevitable.  However, the higher levels of contaminant and wear elements\
  \  than  for the port \nengine could have alerted Fullers to monitor more closely\
  \ the performance of the starboard \nengine.  \n4.3.10.  The starboard engine on\
  \ t he Jet Raider  had undergone a major strip -down, overhaul and re-\nbuild in\
  \ May 2007.  All replacement rotating/moving parts had been  sourced  from  the\
  \ original \nequipment manufacturer (OEM).  Since the major overhaul the engine\
  \ had run for about 6000 \nhours.  T he next major overh aul was scheduled for about\
  \ 24 000 hours.  The 6000 hours it \ntook for the engine to fail correspond ed with\
  \ the time  in which  the bearings would have been \nreplaced  if W\xE4rtsil\xE4\
  ' s group C engine maintenance schedule had been  followed.  \n4.3.11.  Without\
  \ knowing the exact reason for W\xE4rtsil\xE4 or the original engine manufacturer\
  \ specifying a \n6000 -hour interval between big - and little -end bearing replacement\
  \ s, it is difficult to say \nwhether Fullers not following the manufacturer's recommended\
  \ maintena nce schedule was a \nfactor contributing to the engine failure .  However,\
  \ i n its submission on the draft final report  \nW\xE4rtsil\xE4 said that it was\
  \ not likely that any engine component failed due to it being left in \nservice\
  \  longer than the maintenance schedule a llowed . \n \n                       \
  \                                 \n11 Traces of the types of metal that typically\

  \ 11 -203 Findings  \n3. The starboard engine on the Jet Raider  failed after running\
  \ for 6000 hours since it had \nlast been overhauled.  The engine manufacturer recommended\
  \ that the interval between \noverhauls be reduced from 16  000 to 6000 running\
  \ hours  for vessels operating similarly \nto the Jet Raider , but the manufacturer's\
  \ reasons for this were  unclear.   \n4. Fullers ' lubricating  oil analysis program\
  \ me had not detected that the Jet Raider 's \nstarboard engine condition was deteriorating\
  \ in comparison with the port engine 's, but \nthe lubricating oil was still within\
  \ \"normal \" parameters.   \n5. It could not be established whether the timing\
  \ or quality of maintenance contributed in \nany way to the engine failure.   However,\
  \ W\xE4rtsil\xE4 thought it unlikely that any component  \nfailed due to it being\
  \ left in service longer than recommended in the maintenance \nschedule.  \n4.4.\
  \ Emergency response  \n4.4.1.  The crew response to the accident was well thought\
  \ out and followed the emergency response \nplan.  The master organised his crew\
  \ to reassure pas sengers and he anchored his disabled \nvessel.  No 2 emergencies\
  \ are ever the same, which means there will often be  new lessons to \ntake from\
  \  each case.  \n4.4.2.  In this case there were 2  safety  issues identified :\
  \ \n\uF0B7 the procedure for releasing the engine room fixed CO 2 fire-suppression\
  \ system  \n\uF0B7 the procedure for abandoning ship when another vessel is involved\
  \ . \nFixed fire -suppression system  \n4.4.3.  Most of the fleet operated by Fullers\
  \ comprised  catamaran -style vessels, where the engines \nwere  housed separately\
  \ in each hull.  The f ixed CO 2 fire-suppression system was divided into 2 \nsections\
  \ - one for each hull (port and starboard).  Setting off either section would  release\
  \ the \nexact initial number of CO 2 bottles required to extinguish a fire in that\
  \ space.  \n4.4.4.  The Jet Raider  was a mono -hull vessel, where both engines\
  \ were  housed in one engine -room \nspace.  There were 2 CO 2 bottles, labelled\
  \ port and starboard.  A fire in the engine  room \nrequired both bottles to be\
  \ released into the engine room.  However, the engineer only fired \nthe starbo\
  \ ard CO 2 bottle into the engine  room  because he associated the failure of the\
  \ \nstarboard engine with that of the catamaran configuration, forgetting that both\
  \ engines were \nin fact in the same space.  This type of error is not uncommon\
  \ when people  are required to \nswitch between different operations .  It creates\
  \ a risk of the ir apply ing a procedure that would \nnormally be  correct, but\
  \ for a different situation.  \n4.4.5.  The risk of this type of error occurring\
  \ is heightened when people are placed in stressful \nsituations, such as responding\
  \ to an emergency.  A common example of such an error is when \ncar drivers switch\
  \ to vehicles that have the indicator  switch  on the opposite control column  to\
  \ \nwhich  they are used to .  In terms of the study of human factors , this is\
  \ known as  \"negative \ntransfer error \" (D.J. Woltz, 2000) .   \n4.4.6.  If the\
  \ engine failure ha d caused a sustained fire in the engine room , releasing  only\
  \ one of the \n2 required  CO2 cylinders may not have been sufficient to extinguish\
  \ the  fire.  This safety issue \ncould be resolved by placing a clear placard at\
  \ the control station for the fixed CO 2 fire-\nsuppression system, alerting the\
  \ operator that both bottles are required to extinguish a fire in \nthe engine room.\
  \  \n  \n \nFinal report 11 -203 \n<< Page 17 >>\n Abandoning ship  \n4.4.7.  The\
  \ Jet Raider  was fitted with a combination of surviva l craft, buoyant apparatuses',\
  \ (mainly \nlife-rafts) and personal flotation devices in accordance with  Maritime\
  \ Rules.  The devices were \nprovided for the worst -case situation, where passengers\
  \ and crew had little time to abandon \nship and take to the water.  The abandon\
  \ -ship procedures were  designed around evacuating \npassengers and crew into life\
  \ -rafts.  The crew routinely conduct ed abandon -ship and life -raft \ndrills.\
  \  \n4.4.8.  Most of the Fullers vessels operate d in enclos ed or inshore li mits,\
  \ and in areas frequently \nplied by other ferries and recreational vessels.  In\
  \ the previous 10 years there ha d been a \nnumber of incidents and accidents involving\
  \ passenger ferries in the Auckland area, and on \nalmost every occasion the p assengers\
  \ ha d not needed to enter life -rafts.  Instead they ha d \nbeen transferred to\
  \ other vessels in the vicinity.  \n4.4.9.  Fullers ' emergency response plan called\
  \ for another company vessel to be in close proximity \nto provide support  and\
  \ back -up crew and possibly receive passengers in case a vessel had to \nbe abandoned.\
  \   With the number of vessels that F ullers operate d, it was highly likely that\
  \ \nduring a situation there would  be another company vessel nearby.  Fullers would\
  \ also have \nbeen one of 2 operators on the H auraki Gulf wit h the capability\
  \ to accept a lar ge number of \npassengers from a stricken vessel.   \n4.4.10.\
  \  In this case the Starflyte  was close behind the Jet Raider  and was soon close\
  \ by .  When the \nmaster of the Jet Raider  made the decision to transfer his passenge\
  \ rs to the Starflyte , the \nweather was benign and the transfer was made easily\
  \ and efficiently.  If the weather, \n(especially the sea stat e) had been worse,\
  \  the operation would have been more difficult  and \nless safe . \n4.4.11.  Although\
  \ passenger transfer was the more likely method for abandoning ship in the congested\
  \ \nHauraki Gulf, the crews  did not practi se transferring passengers from one\
  \ vessel to another, \nnor did they practi se bringing one vessel alongside another.\
  \  The vessel s in the Fullers fleet \nhad subtly  differ ent heights of rubbing\
  \ strips , and access and egress points.  There would be \nmerit in introducing\
  \ this into the training schedule , and also merit in considering subtle design\
  \ \nchanges to better facilitate ship -to-ship passenger transfers.  \nFindings\
  \  \n6. The emergency response to the engine failure was well thought out and well\
  \ executed .  \nHowever, only half of the fixed CO 2 fire-suppression system was\
  \ released into the \nengine room, which might  not have extinguished a sustained\
  \ fire if one had occurred.  \n7. A clear  placard should be placed at the control\
  \ station for the fixed CO 2 fire-suppression \nsystems on all passenger ferries\
  \ , alerting them to the exact number of CO 2 bottles \nneeded to extinguish a fire\
  \ in each of the protected compartments.  \n8. When an accident or incident occurs\
  \ that requires a passenger ferry operating in \nAuckland's congested Hauraki Gulf\
  \ to abandon ship, it is highly likely that this will be \nachieved by  a ship-to-ship\
  \ transfer of passengers and crew.  This scenario should be \nincluded in emergency\
  \ response training and drills, and passenger ferries from all \ncompanies operating\
  \ in the same area  should be designed to minimise the risk s of such \nan operation.\
