- safety_issue: 'The maintenance and testing procedures for the CO2 fire-smothering system''s booster valve were insufficient to detect and prevent leaks at operational pressures, leading to the uncontrolled release of CO2 into the engine room.

- safety_issue: 'The CO2 system''s pilot cylinder leaked, but the exact cause of the leak could not be determined, indicating a potential oversight in the inspection or maintenance processes for pilot cylinders within the CO2 fire-suppression system.

- safety_issue: 'The booster valve was found to be in poor condition due to corrosion and de-zincification, suggesting that the existing maintenance regime was inadequate to prevent or identify corrosion-related deterioration over time.

- safety_issue: 'The practice of testing the booster valve with compressed air at below normal operating pressures was not effective in identifying potential leaks that could occur under full operating conditions.

- safety_issue: 'The absence of a requirement for a physical inspection of the booster valve''s seating arrangement during maintenance checks could allow deteriorated valves to remain in service, posing a risk to the system''s integrity.

- safety_issue: 'The guidelines for internal inspection of control valves every five years may not be sufficient to detect early deterioration, suggesting that more frequent operational pressure tests could be necessary to ensure system integrity.
