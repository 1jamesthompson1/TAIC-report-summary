  \ rooms contain various machinery installations that provide sources of fuel and\
  \ \nignition for a fire; consequently the risk of a fire occurring is high.  To\
  \ mitigate that risk, \nregulations require fire -detection and fire -fighting systems\
  \ to protect the vessel and its crew.  \nThe CO 2 fixed fire -smothering system\
  \ on board the Marsol Pride  was a safety -critical system \ndesigned to minimise\
  \ the effects of a fire in the engine room.  \n4.1.2.  Activating an engine room\
  \ CO 2 fire-fighting system creates other risks.  An engine room \nflooded with\
  \ CO 2 cannot sustain human life because it displaces the air, and combustion \n\
  engines cannot continue to operate without an adequate air supply.  Any decision\
  \ to activate a \nCO2 system is ma de after considering the risk s to crew who might\
  \  be trapped in the engine \nroom, and the risk of immobilising the propulsion\
  \ and generator systems.  An uncontrolled or \ninadvertent activation of the engine\
  \ room CO 2 system is therefore a serious event.  \n4.1.3.  Even t hough the fire\
  \ alarm on board the Marsol Pride  was activated during the event, there \nwas no\
  \ fire.  Usually in the event of an on -board emergency, the crew response is examined\
  \ for \nany lessons that can be shared, but because there was no fire and the crew\
  \ r esponse to the \nevent was good, this report does not comment on these aspects\
  \ other than to mention them \nnow.  \n4.1.4.  The following analysis only discusses\
  \ how and why the CO 2 gas was released into the engine \nroom, and because the\
  \ maintenance of safety -critical sys tems is important it also comments \non the\
  \ maintenance and testing of the CO2 system and how that might  have contributed\
  \ to the \nincident.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  On the Marsol Pride  an un\
  \ controlled  release of CO 2 gas from the fixed fire -smothering  \ninstallation\
  \ to the  engine room could only have happen ed if there had been  at least 2 points\
  \ of \nfailure.  In this case the first was the release of CO 2 from the pilot cylinder\
  \  into the manifold, \nand the second was the condition of the booster valve that\
  \ allowed CO 2 gas under  pressure to \npass and activate the \"gang release \"\
  \ mechanism and open the main valve.  \n4.2.2.  The possibility of the system having\
  \ been inadvertently activated by someone was considered \nand discounted as unlikely.\
  \  The third engineer reported that the CO 2 remote co ntrol box was \nlocked when\
  \ he arrived there, and the CO 2 room was also locked .  No maintenance was being\
  \ \nperformed on the CO 2 system at the time, and at 2300, no other maintenance\
  \ was being \nconducted in or around the CO 2 room.  \n4.2.3.  The No.1  pilot cylinder\
  \  had be en leaking.  The frosting around its discharge valve and hose \nconnec\
  \ tion to the pressure manifold (F igure 4) was typical of what occurs when CO 2\
  \ gas is \nreleased under pressure.  \n4.2.4.  The Commission has not been able\
  \ to determine why the pilot cylinder  leaked.  T he laboratory \nexamination showed\
  \ that the valve was in good condition with no defects .  By the time the \nCommission\
  \ took possession of the valve:  \n it had been fully opened by the chief engineer\
  \ on board to discharge the remaining CO 2 \ngas, then closed again,  \n it had\
  \ been opened and closed when the cylinder  was refilled at Wanganui,  \n it had\
  \ been  opened to discharge the CO 2 gas again then removed from the cylinder  in\
  \ \nAuckland .   \n4.2.5.  Any foreign debris that might have been trapped between\
  \ the valve and the valve seat could \nhave been expelled, and any maladjustment\
  \ in the valve setting could have been rectified \nduring the refilling process.\
  \  Why the valve on the pilot cylinder  leaked is not as important as \nthe second\
  \ failure:  the leaking booster valve.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Report 10 -203  4.2.6.\
  \  The CO 2 alarm tha t the third engineer heard in the engine room would have been\
  \ caused by \nthe pressure switch detecting the rising pressure in the gas manifold\
  \ as the pilot cylinder  \nleaked.  Had the rest of the system been intact, that\
  \ should have been as far as this incide nt \nwent.  The main valve should have\
  \ prevented the gas entering the engine room, and even if it \ntoo had leaked, the\
  \ consequence would have been the loss of only one cylinder  of CO 2 into the \n\
  engine room with negligible risk to crew and machinery systems.  \n4.2.7.  The laboratory\
  \ inspection of the booster valve showed that it was not in good condition and \n\
  that it was \"very likely\" that it had leaked gas.  CO 2 gas leaking past the booster\
  \ valve would \nand did eventually cause the \"gang release\"  of the other 18 CO\
  \ 2 cylind ers, then 30 seconds \nlater, opened the main valve, which then allowed\
  \ the contents of the entire CO 2 system to \ndischarge into the engine room.  \n\
  4.2.8.  If the CO 2 fire-smothering  system had been  used deliberately, the fans\
  \ would have been \nstopped, either automatica lly by the system, or manually beforehand.\
  \  The various fire \nshutters, doors and dampers around the engine room would have\
  \ been  closed to seal off the \nspace before releasing the CO 2.  In this case\
  \ the supply fans were stopped automatically, but \nthe engine room was not sealed\
  \ off because there was no fire and it was not the crew\u201Fs \nintention to activate\
  \ the CO 2 system.  The main propulsion and generator engines continued to \nrun,\
  \ drawing in outside air through the various engine room openings.  \n4.2.9.  The\
  \ engine room was designed to force -feed outside air to the combustion engines.\
  \  Most of \nthe engines were running at the time, so they would have struggl ed\
  \ to maintain performance \nwithout the air supply fans operating, to the point\
  \ where one of the main engines shut dow n \nowing  to air starvation.  A diesel\
  \ engine that is starved of air produces thick black exhaust \nfumes, and it was\
  \ probably this that the master noticed around the outside deck of the ship as \n\
  he made his way to the bridge in response to the ship\u201Fs fire alar m sounding.\
  \  The exhaust \nsmoke was probably what set off the automatic fire detection system.\
  \  \n4.3. Maintenance of critical systems  \n4.3.1.  Leaks developing in valves\
  \ can be expected from time to time for a number of reasons, so the \npossibility\
  \ of one out of the 20 CO2 cylinder s developing a leak at some time was not remote.\
  \  \nThe possibility of 2 consecutive leaks in the same system was less likely.\
  \  \n4.3.2.  As mentioned earlier , the consequence of a leak in a single CO 2 cylinder\
  \  was not as significant \nas the consequence of a lea k developing in the booster\
  \ valve, because a leak there could \ncause the whole system to activate if pressure\
  \ buil t up in the manifold for some reason, as \nhappened in this case.  That was\
  \ why the procedure for clearing the CO 2 pipes to the engine \nroom  using  compressed\
  \ air recommended  first isolating the booster valve from the pressure \nmanifold,\
  \ which the service technician said he had done  when servicing the system 8 days\
  \ \nbefore the incident.  \n4.3.3.  The integrity of the booster valve was critical\
  \ to the integrity o f the complete system, so it was \nsurprising that a physical\
  \ check of this valve was not included in the maintenance procedure.  \nThe technician\
  \ in this case had check ed that the valve was opening and closing by pulling on\
  \ \nthe wire cable, but no inspection w as made of the actual valve seating arrangement,\
  \ nor was \none specified.  \n4.3.4.  The technician said that he had tested the\
  \ booster valve for leaks, but he had used \ncompressed air at below the normal\
  \ operating pressure of the system.  The valve may well \nhave not le aked when\
  \ tested at this lower pressure, but when the pilot cylinder  leaked into the \n\
  pressure manifold the booster valve would have been potentially holding against\
  \ the full \noperating pressure of the system, causing it to then leak.  \n4.3.5.\
  \  The Commission could no t establish how long the booster valve had been leaking,\
  \ nor could it \nestablish how long the debris had been trapped within the valve\
  \ seal.  If the booster valve had \nblown through with compressed air, as had happened\
  \ during maintenance 8 days before the \nincident, any debris within the pressure\
  \ manifold could have pass ed through and lodge d \nwithin the valve.  \n  \nReport\
  \ 10 -203 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3.6.  The laboratory examination revealed that the\
  \ brass booster valve piston and valve seat had \nbeen attacked by corrosion in\
  \ the form of de -zincification, a process where the zinc \ncomponent in brass preferentially\
  \ corrodes or oxidises.  The report sa id also that CO 2 \ndissolving in moisture\
  \ form ed carbonic acid, a substance known to attack the zinc inclusion in \nstandard\
  \ brass.  \n4.3.7.  The de -zincification around the val ve seat would have exacerbated\
  \ the propensity for the valve \nto leak past debris trapped within the valve seal.\
  \  The condition in which this booster valve \nwas found justifies a regular inspection\
  \ and cleaning of the booster valve or any control valve \nin oth er fixed CO 2\
  \ systems that are critical to the integrity of the whole system.   \n4.3.8.  The\
  \ IMO guidelines say that control valves should be internally inspected at least\
  \ every 5 \nyears, which might be sufficient, provided that such valves are tested\
  \ under operation al \npressure at more frequent intervals; annual inspections for\
  \ example.  In this way any early \ndeterioration in the valve performance could\
  \ be detected and lead to timely inspection and \nrepair before an event such as\
  \ this incident occurs.  \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
