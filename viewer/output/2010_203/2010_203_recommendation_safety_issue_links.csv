2010_203,019/11,"Critical components in a fixed CO2 gas fire fighting system such as control valves can cause serious harm or immobilise a vessel if they fail. It is a concern that such components are only required to be internally examined every 5 years and are not required to be tested at the design operating pressure at all.
It is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forward this report to the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Classification Societies so that they can draw on the lessons learned from this incident and consider amending the current guidelines to require a more robust examination and testing regime for such critical components. (019/11)",,"The maintenance and testing procedures for the CO2 fire-smothering system's booster valve were insufficient to detect and prevent leaks at operational pressures, leading to the uncontrolled release of CO2 into the engine room.

(019/11)",,"The CO2 system's pilot cylinder leaked, but the exact cause of the leak could not be determined, indicating a potential oversight in the inspection or maintenance processes for pilot cylinders within the CO2 fire-suppression system.
