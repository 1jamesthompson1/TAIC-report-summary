- name: Maintenance of Safety-Critical Systems
  explanation: "Maintenance of safety-critical systems is a key safety theme in this accident. The CO2 fire-fighting system on the Marsol Pride was a safety-critical system designed to minimize the effects of a fire in the engine room (\"Ships\u201F engine rooms contain various machinery installations that provide sources of fuel and ignition for a fire; consequently the risk of a fire occurring is high\" (4.1.1)). The incident occurred due to failures in the maintenance and testing of this system, specifically the booster valve which was critical to the system's integrity (\"The integrity of the booster valve was critical to the integrity of the complete system\" (4.3.3)). The failure of this valve was caused by a combination of corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal (\"The failure of the valve was caused by a combination of corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal\" (5.3))."
- name: Inspection and Testing Procedures
  explanation: Inspection and testing procedures are another safety theme related to this accident. The report highlights that the integrity of a fixed CO2 fire-fighting system cannot be assured with only a requirement to inspect control valves every 5 years, without periodic pressure testing ("The integrity of a fixed CO2 fire-fighting system cannot be assured when the only requirement is to inspect control valves every 5 years, with no requirement to pressure test them periodically" (5.4)). This suggests that the existing inspection and testing procedures were insufficient to detect the deterioration in the valve performance, which led to the incident.
- name: Risk of Uncontrolled System Activation
  explanation: "The risk of uncontrolled system activation is a safety theme that is central to this accident. The report states that an uncontrolled or unplanned activation of a ship's fixed CO2 fire smothering system is a serious event because it can cause harm to crew members and could immobilize the ship at a critical time (\"An uncontrolled or unplanned activation of a ship\u201Fs fixed CO2 fire smothering system is a serious event because it can cause serious harm to crew members and could immobilise the ship at a critical time of its operation or voyage\" (5.1)). The inadvertent release of CO2 in the Marsol Pride's engine room was due to the successive and independent failure of two valves, which was an uncontrolled event with serious implications (\"An uncontrolled release of CO2 gas into the Marsol Pride\u201Fs engine room occurred owing to the successive and independent failure of 2 valves in the fixed CO2 fire-fighting system\" (5.2))."
- name: Human Factors and System Design
  explanation: "Human factors and system design are relevant to this accident as the design of the CO2 system and the actions of the crew in response to the system's activation are important considerations. The report notes that the engine room was not sealed off because there was no fire and it was not the crew's intention to activate the CO2 system (\"In this case the supply fans were stopped automatically, but the engine room was not sealed off because there was no fire and it was not the crew\u201Fs intention to activate the CO2 system\" (4.2.8)). This indicates that the system's design and the crew's interaction with it during an emergency are critical for safety."
- name: Corrosion and Material Degradation
  explanation: Corrosion and material degradation are significant safety themes in this accident. The report identifies that the brass booster valve piston and valve seat had been attacked by corrosion in the form of de-zincification, which contributed to the valve's failure ("The laboratory examination revealed that the brass booster valve piston and valve seat had been attacked by corrosion in the form of de-zincification" (4.3.6)). This highlights the importance of material selection and corrosion prevention in the maintenance of safety-critical systems.
- name: Adequacy of Safety Regulations
  explanation: The adequacy of safety regulations is a theme that emerges from the report's findings. The report suggests that the existing regulations, which required control valves to be internally inspected at least every 5 years, may not be sufficient to ensure the safety of critical systems like the CO2 fire-fighting system ("The IMO guidelines say that control valves should be internally inspected at least every 5 years, which might be sufficient, provided that such valves are tested under operational pressure at more frequent intervals" (4.3.8)). This indicates a need to review and potentially enhance safety regulations to prevent similar incidents.
