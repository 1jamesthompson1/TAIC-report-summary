Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Failure of CO2 fire-fighting system: The report highlights the uncontrolled release of CO2 gas into the engine room due to the successive failure of two valves in the fixed CO2 fire-fighting system. This failure poses serious risks to crew members and can immobilize the ship during critical operations or voyages.

2. Maintenance and testing deficiencies: The report identifies maintenance and testing deficiencies in the CO2 system. The leaking pilot cylinder and booster valve, as well as the presence of debris in the valve seal, indicate a lack of regular inspection and cleaning. The report suggests that regular inspections, more frequent testing under operational pressure, and timely repairs could have prevented the incident.

3. Corrosion and debris entrapped in valve seal: The failure of the booster valve, a critical component in the CO2 system, was attributed to corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal. The report emphasizes the need for regular inspection and cleaning of control valves in CO2 systems to prevent such failures.

4. Inadequate regulations: The report highlights the inadequacy of regulations that only require control valves to be inspected every 5 years without periodic pressure testing. This finding suggests that current regulations do not ensure the integrity of fixed CO2 fire-fighting systems and may need to be revised to prevent similar incidents.
