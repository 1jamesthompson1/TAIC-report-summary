","0.0","90.0","The incident was caused by the successive and independent failure of two valves in the fixed CO2 fire-fighting system (5.2). The booster valve, a critical component, failed due to corrosion and debris entrapped within the valve seal (5.3). The maintenance procedure did not include a physical check of the booster valve, and the valve was tested at a pressure below normal operating conditions (4.3.3, 4.3.4). The condition of the booster valve justifies a regular inspection and cleaning, and the IMO guidelines suggest control valves should be internally inspected at least every 5 years (4.3.7, 4.3.8). The integrity of the fixed CO2 fire-fighting system cannot be assured with only a 5-year inspection requirement and no periodic pressure testing (5.4).
