2010_203,019/11,"Critical components in a fixed CO2 gas fire fighting system such as control valves can cause serious harm or immobilise a vessel if they fail. It is a concern that such components are only required to be internally examined every 5 years and are not required to be tested at the design operating pressure at all.
It is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forward this report to the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Classification Societies so that they can draw on the lessons learned from this incident and consider amending the current guidelines to require a more robust examination and testing regime for such critical components.
