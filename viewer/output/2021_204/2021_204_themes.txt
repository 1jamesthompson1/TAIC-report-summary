Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of planning and preparation: The fishing trip was planned hastily and the participants were not well-prepared to survive a maritime incident. They did not bring food or extra water, and the skipper's experience was not underpinned by formal maritime training.

2. Alcohol impairment: The skipper's coordination and judgment were likely impaired by alcohol consumption. This affected their risk perception and may have led to the decision to navigate over the bar instead of taking the safer route through the South Channel.

3. Insufficient use of personal flotation devices (PFDs): Although there were enough PFDs on board, the skipper was the only one wearing one. The other two passengers removed theirs when they started fishing. If everyone had been wearing appropriate PFDs, their chances of survival would have been better.

4. Dangerous harbor bar conditions: Navigating over the bar placed the vessel at a high risk of encountering conditions in which it would be prone to capsize and swamping. The Manukau bar is known for its unpredictable and dangerous waves, and the skipper's decision to navigate over the bar instead of taking the safer route contributed to the accident.

5. Lack of regulation and licensing for recreational boaters: New Zealand's recreational boating sector has little regulation, and there is no requirement for recreational skippers to demonstrate a minimum standard of competency. This lack of regulation and licensing may contribute to unsafe boating practices and accidents.

6. Need for improved education and training: The report highlights the need for improved education and training for recreational boaters. Currently, boating safety information and courses are available but remain optional. Implementing a system for administering recreational boats and setting training standards for skippers could help improve safety and reduce accidents.
