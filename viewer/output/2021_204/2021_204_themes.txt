Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of planning and preparation: The fishing trip was planned hastily and the participants were not well-prepared to survive a maritime incident. They did not bring food or extra water, and the skipper's experience was not underpinned by formal maritime training.

2. Alcohol impairment: The skipper's coordination and judgment were likely impaired by alcohol consumption. This affected their risk perception and may have led to the decision to navigate over the bar instead of taking the safer route.

3. Insufficient use of personal flotation devices (PFDs): Although there were enough PFDs on board, the skipper was the only one wearing one. The other passengers chose not to wear PFDs, and this significantly reduced their chances of survival.

4. Lack of regulation and licensing for recreational boaters: There is little regulation in the recreational boating sector in New Zealand. There is no requirement for registration or licensing of recreational vessels, and there are no minimum standards for boat design and construction. This lack of regulation contributes to a lack of competency among recreational skippers.

5. Hazards of navigating harbor bars: Harbor bars, such as the Manukau bar, present significant hazards to navigation. The unpredictable and dangerous conditions, including breaking waves, increase the risk of capsizing and swamping for small boats.

6. Need for improved education and training: There is a need for a formal system to administer recreational boats and set training standards for skippers. This would help ensure a minimum standard of competency and improve safety practices among recreational boaters.
