- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The report indicates that the crew's response to the fire and interviews following the incident suggested that the fire drills on board the Taokas Wisdom might not have been effective in ensuring that all crew were familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire (4.4.3). The second officer, despite having been on board for 9 months and attending at least 9 firefighting drills, was unaware that his team was responsible for controlling ventilation in the event of a fire (4.4.4). This lack of knowledge and training contributed to the ineffectiveness of the firefighting response, as the supply of air to the cabin where the fire was located had not been shut down (5.2).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The crew did not follow established safety procedures during the incident. The master did not report to the bridge to take control from there, no crew muster was conducted, and no one from the ship alerted the shore authorities to the fire (4.3.5). Additionally, not all crew reported to the muster station, and firefighting teams were assembled on an ad-hoc basis (4.3.6). This lack of adherence to safety procedures likely reduced the effectiveness of the shipboard firefighting response (5.2).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The crew's emergency response was not adequately prepared, as evidenced by the lack of an effective command and control of the firefighting response and the fire not being contained within the cabin until the firefighting teams were fully ready to engage (5.2). The master's failure to assume control from the bridge and the absence of a structured response to the fire could have resulted in a more serious outcome had the fire not been brought under control (4.3.7).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The safety management system on board the Taokas Wisdom had procedures and instructions for emergency shipboard operations, including lifesaving and firefighting (4.4.6). However, the internal ISM audit found that "each crew member understands his emergency responsibilities and duties as assigned in [the] muster list," which the findings of the report contradicted (4.4.7-4.4.8). This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the safety culture within the organization, as the crew was not familiar with their responsibilities in the event of a fire (5.3).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The lack of effective crew resource management was evident in the crew's response to the fire. There was no structured firefighting response, and the master did not take control from the bridge (4.3.5). The crew did not muster, and firefighting teams were assembled on an ad-hoc basis (4.3.6). This lack of coordination and teamwork likely reduced the effectiveness of the firefighting response (5.2).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the report does not directly address risk management and analysis, the failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with the fire, such as not shutting down the supply of air to the cabin, suggests that risk management practices may not have been fully effective (5.2).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Human error and assumptions may have played a role in the incident, as the crew did not follow established safety procedures, and there was a lack of knowledge regarding responsibilities during an emergency (4.3.5, 4.4.4). These errors and assumptions likely contributed to the reduced effectiveness of the firefighting response (5.2).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no specific mention in the report of a failure in regulatory oversight and compliance contributing to the incident. The ship was conducting monthly firefighting drills as required by SOLAS (4.4.2), indicating compliance with regulations.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
