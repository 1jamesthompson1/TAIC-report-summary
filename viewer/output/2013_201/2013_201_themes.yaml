- name: Firefighting Training and Drills
  explanation: Firefighting training and drills are essential for ensuring that all crew members are familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire. This theme is relevant to the accident because the report indicates that the drills conducted on board the Taokas Wisdom were not effective in preparing the crew for a real fire event. The report states, "The firefighting drills held on board the Taokas Wisdom were not effective in ensuring that all crew members were familiar with their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire" (4.4.3, 5.3). Additionally, the second officer was unaware of his responsibility for controlling ventilation during a fire, which is a critical aspect of firefighting on a ship (4.4.4, 4.3.14).
- name: Command and Control during Firefighting
  explanation: Establishing an effective command and control system during a firefighting response is crucial to manage the situation efficiently and minimize damage. This theme is relevant because the report highlights the lack of an effective command and control system as a factor that likely reduced the effectiveness of the shipboard firefighting response. The master did not report to the bridge to take control and coordinate the firefighting efforts, and no crew muster was conducted to account for all crew members (4.3.5, 4.3.6, 5.2).
- name: Containment of Fire
  explanation: Containing a fire to prevent it from spreading is a fundamental aspect of firefighting on ships. This theme is relevant to the accident as the report points out that the fire was not contained within the cabin until the firefighting teams were fully ready to engage. The chief officer attempted to tackle the fire with a portable extinguisher without wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and had to retreat, likely leaving the door open, which allowed the fire to spread (4.3.9, 5.2).
- name: Denying Oxygen to the Fire
  explanation: Denying oxygen to a fire is essential to extinguishing it, and this can be achieved by closing down the air supply to the space that is on fire. This theme is relevant because the report indicates that the supply of air to the cabin where the fire was located had not been shut down, which allowed the fire to continue burning and spreading. The automatic closing of the recirculation air damper restricted the airflow to some extent, but the fire was force-fed air due to the failure to manually close other dampers (4.3.11, 4.3.14, 5.2).
- name: Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
  explanation: Fire detection and alarm systems are critical for early fire detection and initiating a prompt response. This theme is relevant as the report discusses the importance of shipboard systems for detecting and responding to fires. Although not directly implicated in the ineffectiveness of the firefighting response in this incident, the report emphasizes the role of early detection systems in mitigating the risk of fire spreading quickly (4.1.1).
- name: Fire Investigation and Evidence Preservation
  explanation: Conducting a thorough fire investigation and preserving evidence are key to understanding the cause of a fire and preventing future occurrences. This theme is relevant because the report mentions that the Commission was unable to identify a definitive cause for the fire, mainly due to the cleanup efforts of the crew, which disturbed the evidence before a proper investigation could be conducted (4.1.3, 5.1).
