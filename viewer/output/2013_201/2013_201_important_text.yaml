  \ a ship is a serious occurrence.  The presence of machinery spaces and cargo \n\
  holds adjoining accommodation blocks of modular construction means the risk of a\
  \ fire \nspreading quickly  is high.  The risk is mitigated by  using  fire-resistant\
  \ construction methods, \nearly fire detection systems and robust crew  training\
  \ in, and procedures for, responding to \nfires.  \n4.1.2.  The system for preventing,\
  \ detecting and extinguishing fires on ships is designed around  ships \nneeding\
  \ to be  self-sufficient , rather than relying on integration with shore -based\
  \ fire services , \nbecause fires can occur any time while at sea.  The crew's knowledge\
  \ on how to respond to \nfires is, therefore, paramount.  The International Maritime\
  \ Organi zation  conventions  require \ncrews to be trained in firefighting4, and\
  \ to participate in fire drills at least once each month5. \n4.1.3.  The Commission\
  \ was unable to identify a definitive cause for this fire, mainly due to the clean\
  \ -\nup efforts of the crew once the fire was extinguished, which resulted in a\
  \ disturbance of the \nevidence before investigators from the Commissio n and the\
  \ New Zealand Fire Service were \nable to conduct their scene examination s.  A\
  \ number of possible causes are discussed in \nsection 4.2 . \n4.1.4.  In this case\
  \ the crew were able to bring the fire under control through their actions alone\
  \ . The \nshore fire personn el followed up to extinguish the fire  fully.  Because\
  \ of the importance of \nshipboard systems for detecting and responding to fires,\
  \ those systems were examined to \nidentify lessons that could  be drawn  to help\
  \ reduce the number and severity  of shipboard fire s \nin future.  These lessons\
  \ are discussed in section 4.3 . \n4.1.5.  Section 4.4  discusses circumstances\
  \ of a broader nature that contributed to the fire - the \neffectiveness of fire\
  \ drills and training on board the Taokas Wisdom . \n4.2. Potential c ause s of\
  \ the fire  \n4.2.1.  For a fire to develop  there must be a source of fuel, a source\
  \ of heat (ignition) and an ample \nsupply of air ( oxygen) .  In order to determine\
  \ the cause of a fire, investigators look for evidence \nof how  all 3 sides of\
  \ what is called the fire triangle (heat,  fuel and oxygen) were present.  \n4.2.2.\
  \  As the cabin was cleaned prior to investigators boarding the ship, it was not\
  \ possible to \nidentify the cause of the fire  definitively .  The Commission relied\
  \ on the fire investigation \nreport appended to this report, which discusse d several\
  \ potential ignition sources examined \nby the specialist fire investigators (see\
  \ Appendix 1 for the full fire investigation report) . \n  \n                  \

  \ and its contents  \n4.2.3.  The cabin was 2 metres wide and 5 metres long. The\
  \ layout of the cabin and the location of \nthe main contents are shown in F igure\

  \ some books on the table and \nsome  papers on the shelf directly above the table.\
  \  The chair in the cabin was a plastic swivel \ntype, and was located close to\
  \ the table.   The bed was located in the starboard aft corner of \nthe cabin. \
  \  According to A B-3, he left his MP4 player on the forward side of the bed close\
  \ to \nthe pillow.  Two cardboard boxes were placed between the bed and the day\
  \ bed. Inside the \ncardboard boxes were an old duvet and a raincoat.  \n4.2.5.\
  \  A steel locker was located in the forward starboa rd corner of the cabin.   AB-3\

  \ cabin, the B -deck  alleyway and the common \nbulkhead between AB -3's cabin and\
  \ the adjacent cabin.  There was extensive smoke damage \nto the alleyway and to\
  \ other cabins where  their doors had been  left open.  \n4.2.7.  The corner of\
  \ the bed , closest to the centre of the cabin , showed extensive fire damage (see\
  \ \nFigure 7 ).  The mattress, duvet and pillow were all severely burnt.  The day\
  \ bed showed signs \nof fire damage, particularly at the end closest to the centre\
  \ of the cabin.  \n4.2.8.  AB-3's cabin bulkhead ha d suffered significant heat\
  \ damage , resulting in the buckling of the \nbulkhead lining.  The buckling was\
  \ greatest at the centre of the cabin.  The common bulkhead \nof the adjoining cabin\
  \ als o show ed signs of surface damage (see Figure 8).  \n \nFigure 7 \n An undamaged\

  \ \n Heat damage on the common bulkhead of the adjoining cabin  \n \n4.2.9.  Heat\
  \ damage to the floor in the centre of the cabin had lifted the floor coating ,\
  \ revealing the \nsheet -steel floor  beneath .  \n4.2.10.  The metal cabin desk\
  \ situated in the aft c orner of the cabin (see Figure 7 ) was heat damaged \nand\
  \ the charred remains of a water heater and some books were fo und on top of the\
  \ desk.  An \nelectric socket was located on the aft wall and the remains of a book\
  \ shelf containing books \nand various papers were present .  The remains of a hand\
  \ basin were found on the port \nbulkhead of the cabin.  The light fitting s in\
  \ the cabin were damaged and only the bare frame of \nthe central overhead fluorescent\
  \ lamp remained.  \n4.2.11.  The water -heat ing jug situated on the metal desk\
  \ had been  plugged in  to the power source  \nwhen AB-3 left his cabin  about 2\
  \ hours before the fire .  AB-3 had not had any trouble with the \nwater heater\
  \ prior to this incident and he considered it to have been  in good working order\
  \ .  \nThe specialist fire investigators observed that the fire damage in the rest\
  \ of the cabin was not \nconsistent with the fire starting in the wa ter heater.\
  \  Moreover , no electrical fault alarm was \nregistered on the ship's alarm panel.\
  \   If a fault in the water heater had developed, it is likely \nthat this would\
  \ have either tripped an electrical circuit breaker or shown as an earth fault.\
  \  The \nwater heater is therefore not considered a probable cause of the fire.\
  \ \nLight fitting   \n4.2.12.  The centre light in the cabin was a fl uorescent\
  \  lamp with a diffuser cover.  AB-3 confirmed that \nthis light had been  left\
  \ on when he left his cabin about 2 hours before the fire.  This light fitting \n\
  was in the centre of the room above where the seat of the fire was located, and\
  \ it was \nextensively damaged.  As with the water heater, t he ship's alarm system\
  \ had not register ed \nany electrical fault prior to the incident.   No previous\
  \ issues had be en recorded  with the  \nlighting system in the cabin .  For the\
  \ se reason s, it is not likely that the light was the cause of \nthe fire, but\
  \ given the amount of damage it sustained  and its location directly over the seat\
  \ of \nthe fire, the possibi lity could not be excluded.  \n\n \nFinal report RO\
  \ -2013 -201 \n<< Page 11 >>\n MP4 player  \n4.2.13.  The MP4  player  had been\
  \  on the bed when AB-3 left his cabin, but not connected to its electric \ncharger.\
  \   The remains of the MP4  player were found next to the pillow  at the head of\
  \ the bed \non the side clo sest to the centre of the cabin .  There was no evidence\
  \ to promote or discount \nthe notion that the MP4  player was the source of ignition\
  \ . \nIncendiarism6 \n4.2.14.  When AB-3, a confirmed non -smoker,  left his cabin\
  \ on the day of the incident, the cabin door \nwas shut but not locked . The mattress\
  \ on the bed was a polyurethane foam squab.   A portion \nin the centre of the mattress\
  \ burnt through to the wooden base.  The fire investigation report \nstate d that\
  \ t he unusual b urn pattern damage to the mattress was not consistent  with the\
  \ fire \ndamage to the rest of the mattress.  The heat damage on the floor  towards\
  \ the centre of the \ncabin  separated the coating from the steel  deck.   The resulting\
  \ irregular -shaped pattern on the \nfloor indicated that this area of the deck\
  \ had been subjected to a greater heat source  than \nothers .  The fire investigation\
  \ report also stated that i n the reported absence of any \ncomb ustible materials\
  \ in this area that could produce t his kind of damage , the possibility  of a \n\
  flammable  liquid fuel being used cannot be discounted . \n4.2.15.  If, however\
  \ , there had been  some form of combustible  material in the centre of the floor\
  \ , or if \nburning materials had dropped from above onto this area , this co uld\
  \ be one explanation for \nthe observed fire pattern.  \nFinding  \n1. The cause\
  \ of the fire could not be conclusively  identified due to the cabin \nhaving been\
  \ cleaned before a scene investigation could be conducted.  \n \n4.3. Firefighting\
  \ on board the Taokas Wisdom  \n4.3.1.  When a  fire occurs on board a ship,  no\
  \ matter how small it might at first appear,  the key \nelements of the response\
  \ are to report the fire, then contain it to prevent it spreading and \nextinguish\
  \ it.  It is important to set up an efficient command and control syst em to ensure\
  \ that \nthis is done efficiently with the aim of preserving life and preventing\
  \ damage to the ship, whilst \nminimising the risk to the ship's crew.  \n4.3.2.\
  \  In this case the crew succeeded in bringing  the fire under control.  However,\
  \ there are some \nlesson s that can be taken from their response that could have\
  \ limited the amount of damage \nto the ship and resulted in the fire being extinguished\
  \ sooner.  \nCommand and control  \nSafety lesson - Establishing a command centre\
  \ as a focal point for maintaining a management \noverview of a firefighting response\
  \ will increase the chances of controlling a fire and minimising the \ndamage it\
  \ causes . \n4.3.3.  In the event of a fire, the master 's designated location was\
  \ the ship's bridge, where he was  \nrequired  to establish a command  centre from\
  \ where he could co-ordinate and communicate \nwith the ship's firefighting teams\
  \ .  From there he would have access to  the communication \nequipment to alert\
  \ the shore -based authorities to the fire.  \n4.3.4.  When the fire alarm rings,\
  \ an important task is for the crew to muster at the muster station, so \nthat the\
  \ master can establish the whereabouts of all the crew .  This help s to establish\
  \ what \nresources are available and whether anyone is unaccounted for.  This task\
  \ is  made more \n                                                        \n6 The\
  \ act or practice of illegal burning (arson).  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report\
  \ RO -2013 -201 difficult when a ship is in  port because not all crew  will necessarily\
  \ be on board, and there will \nhighly likely be shore -based persons on board as\
  \ well.  \n4.3.5.  In this case the master did not report to the bridge and take\
  \ control from there.  No crew \nmuster was conducted and no -one from t he ship\
  \ alerted the shore authorities to the fire.  \n4.3.6.  Not all of the crew reported\
  \ to the muster station.  Instead, they generally congregated around \nthe location\
  \ of the fire , and firefighting teams were assembled on an ad -hoc basis.  \n4.3.7.\
  \  Had the fire not been bro ught under control, this lack of structure and delays\
  \ in getting all \navailable resources to fight the fire could have resulted in\
  \ a more serious outcome.  \nContainment of the fire  \nSafety lesson - Enclosing\
  \ the space that is on fire (or leaving it enclosed) w ill help prevent the spread\
  \ of \nthe fire and minimise the damage it causes.  \n4.3.8.  The c ontainment of\
  \ a fire is important .  In this case the fire was initially contained within a\
  \ \nsingle cabin . The cabin door was classified as a B -0 fire -retardant door,\
  \ which meant  it was \ndesigned to resist fire as far as practical to the same\
  \ standard as the B-Class  bulkhead in \nwhich it was situated.  The International\
  \ Code for the Application of Fire Test Procedures, \n2010 state d that a B -class\
  \ bulkhead must be able to contain a fire for a minimum duration of \n30 minutes.\
  \  \n4.3.9.  The chief officer was in  charge of the deck firefighting team .  Having\
  \ first reported to the \nbridge he went to the scene of the fire.  There he ordered\
  \ that the cabin door be opened so \nthat he could tackle the fi re with a portable\
  \ fire extinguisher .  He was not wearing self -\ncontained breathing apparatus\
  \ and was quickly  overcome by the thick smoke and heat from \nthe cabin and had\
  \ to retreat , most likely leaving the door open as the alleyway was soon \nengulfed\
  \ in smok e.  The fire was then no longer contained and began to spread across the\
  \ \nalleyway.  \n4.3.10.  There are cases when  a fire is obviously small and can\
  \ realistically be tackled immediately by \nthe first responders, but this was not\
  \ one of them.  Entry to a burning cabin should generally \nnot be attempted until\
  \ sufficient firefighting resources are ready to combat the fire.  In this \ncase,\
  \ crew wearing self -contained breathing apparatus ready with fully charged fire\
  \ hoses \nwould have been an effective solution.  \nDenying o xygen  to the fire\
  \  \nSafety lesson - Closing down the air supply to a space that is on fire is essential\
  \ to extinguishing the \nfire. \n4.3.11.  One method of containing a fire is to\
  \ starve it of oxygen.  Leaving the room enclosed is one \nmethod of achieving this,\
  \ but sources of airflow into the space should  be considered as well. \nMost accommodation\
  \ blocks on ships are enclosed , controlled environme nts.  On board the \nTaokas\
  \ Wisdom , the supply of fresh air to the cabins  could be stopped by closing appropriate\
  \ \nventilation dampers fitted within the ventil ation ducting.  \n \n \nFinal report\
  \ RO -2013 -201 \n<< Page 13 >>\n  \nFigure 9 \n Air circulation flow chart showing\
  \ location s of automatic dampers  \n \n4.3.12.  Figure 9 is an air circulation\
  \ flow chart showing the direction of airflow (green arrows) from the \nair-conditioning\
  \ plant, through the accommodation spaces and back to the air -condition ing \n\
  unit through the recirculation ducting.   The air  ducts had 9 automatic fire  dampers\
  \ , each fitted  \nwith fuses that would trigger a damper -closing mechanism once\
  \ the temperature of the fuse s \nreached 72 degrees  Celsius .  It was also possible\
  \ to close  these automatic fire damper s \nmanually . \n4.3.13.  On the day of\
  \ the incident , the heat from the fire caused the fuse on the B -deck return -air\
  \ \ndamper to break.  The damper automatically closed, isolating the f ire from\
  \ the return -air \nducting (see the yellow circle in F igure 9).  However, the\
  \ nearest supp ly-air damper  was \nlocated on t he A -deck , where the temperature\
  \ rise was not sufficient to close the damper  \nautomatically . \nair dampers that\
  \ \nwere not shut. This \nmeant the fire had a \ncontinuous supply of \nair \nthe\
  \ air damper \nthat shut  \nautomatically \npreventing flames \nentering the \n\
  recirculation \nducting  \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -201 4.3.14.\
  \  Closing down ventilation systems is a critical aspect of shipboard firefighting.\
  \  Most ships have \ndedicated fire part ies whose task is to achieve this.   There\
  \ were 70 manually operated and 9 \nautomatic fire dampers on board the Taokas Wisdom\
  \ .  The ship's fire muster plan identified a \ndedicated ventilation and first\
  \ aid team, led by the second officer .  However, the second \nofficer  was not\
  \ aware that he was supposed to be in charge of the ventilation team.  \nConsequently\
  \ no fire dampers were closed manually, which meant the fire in AB -3's cabin was\
  \ \nbeing force  fed air.  The automatic closing of the recirculation air damper\
  \ would have  \nrestricted the supply of air to some extent, but not totally.  Once\
  \ the cabin door was opened \nand remained open, any restriction of the airflow\
  \ would have been removed, and the fire \nwould have naturally spread out through\
  \ the open door into the alleyway.  \n4.3.15.  The fact that the second officer\
  \  was not aware of his responsibilities for a firefighting response \nis discussed\
  \ in the following section.  \nFinding  \n2.  The following  factors were likely\
  \  to have  reduced the effectiveness of the \nshipboard firefighting response:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the lack of an effective command and control of the firefighting response\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the fire was not contained within the cabin until the firefighting teams\
  \ were \nfully ready to engage  \n\uF0B7 the supply of air to the cabin where the\
  \ fire was located had not been shut \ndown . \n \n4.4. On-board training and procedures\
  \ for firefighting  \nSafety issue :  The firefighting drills held on board the\
  \ Taokas Wisdom  were not effective in \nensuring  that all crew were familiar with\
  \ their tasks and responsibilities in the event of a fire.  \n4.4.1.  Chapter 3,\
  \ Regulation 19 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ,\
  \ 1974  \n(SOLAS) states that \"crew members of all ships shall participate in at\
  \ least one abandon ship \ndrill and one fire drill every month\".  Regulation 19\
  \ also states tha t the \"details of the drills \nconducted must be recorded in\
  \ a logbook prescribed by the government of the state whose \nflag the ship is entitled\
  \ to fly\".  \n4.4.2.  The records on board the Taokas Wisdom  showed that firefighting\
  \ drills were conducted every \nmonth in acc ordance with the SOLAS Convention.\
  \  A firefighting checklist (see Appendix 3) was \ncompleted following each drill,\
  \ and signed by the master , stating  that the standard of the drill \nwas satisfactory.\
  \  \n4.4.3.  To be effective , drills should aim to be as close to realistic as\
  \ possible, and should over time \ntest all aspects of firefighting on board using\
  \ several scenarios.  The more often a procedure is \npractised, the more likely\
  \ it is that the crew will respond in the correct wa y when under the \nadded pressure\
  \ of a real event.  The crew response to this fire, and interviews with crew \n\
  following the fire, indicate d that the fire drills on board the Taokas Wisdom \
  \ might not have \nachieved this aim.  \n4.4.4.  The second officer had been on\
  \ board the Taokas Wisdom  for 9 months, which meant he had \nattended at least\
  \ 9 firefighting drills.  However, he was still unaware that his team was \nresponsible\
  \ for controlling ventilation in the event of a fire.  The master was unsure of\
  \ which \nofficer was in char ge of which fire party.  Instead of assuming control\
  \ of the firefighting \nresponse from the bridge, the master immersed himself in\
  \ managing the event from near the \nscene of the fire.  \n4.4.5.  The International\
  \ Safety Management Code (ISM  Code) requires a ship owner or any person \nwho assumes\
  \ responsibility for a ship to develop and establish a safety management system\
  \ \nthat meets the objectives of the Code.  Safety management systems are developed\
  \ to foster a \n \nFinal report RO -2013 -201 \n<< Page 15 >>\n culture of safety\
  \ on board a ship and within the compan y that operate s that ship. This is \nachieved\
  \ by assigning responsibility and accountability for safety at all levels, and in\
  \ particular \nat the senior management level.  \n4.4.6.  The safety management\
  \ system on  board the Taokas Wisdom  had procedures and \ninstructions for emergency\
  \  shipboard operations , including  lifesaving  and firefighting .  The \nfirefighting\
  \ checklists appeared to be generic in nature, but they covered essential routines\
  \ \nthat needed to be performed in the event o f a fire.  \n4.4.7.  The ISM Code\
  \  requires an  organisation responsible for the operation of a ship to conduct\
  \ \nmandatory internal audits at intervals generally not exceeding 12 months. On\
  \ 16 June 2013 a \ncompany auditor had boarded the ship and conducted an internal\
  \ ISM audit .  The audit was \ncompleted on the same day and co vered 60 \"key auditing\
  \ items \" (see Appendix 5) . The \naudit or found that 59 out of the 60 audited\
  \  items  were complying with the requirements of the \nISM C ode and the ship's\
  \ safety management system , including that \"each crew member \nunderstands his\
  \ emergency responsibilities and duties as assigned in [the] muster list\" . \n\
  4.4.8.  The findings of this report show that this was not necessarily the case,\
  \ and that the company 's \nsafety management system would want to target this specific\
  \ item in mor e detail in future \naudits.  \nFinding  \n3.  The firefighting drills\
  \ held on board the Taokas Wisdom  were not effective in \nensuring  that all crew\
  \ members were familiar with their tasks and \nresponsibilities in the event of\
  \ a fire.  \n \n  \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
