  \ of track workers from rail vehicles is a fundamental \npremise of any rail operation.\
  \ It is therefore essential that  robust  and proven safe \nmethods of working are\
  \ in place to prevent  potential interaction s between workers a nd \nrail traffic\
  \ .  \n3.2. On this occasion the RPO allowed a signals technician to enter the PWA\
  \ without \nfollowing the procedure prescribed  in rule 902 and as a result a significant\
  \ safety barrier \nwas breached.  \n3.3. The following analysis discusses the events\
  \ and circumstances surrounding the \ncancellation of the PWA  before it was hand\
  \ ed back to train control , while a worker was \nstill present  and working on\
  \ the track .  \nCircumstances  \n3.4. Immediately prior to the incident the work\
  \ group was in the process of disestablishi ng \nthe worksite. Members of the work\
  \ group had been required to work for an additional  \nhour past their rostered\
  \  time of 1800  to ensure that the track repair  work was complete d. \n3.5. As\
  \ soon as the worksite was handed back to train control for operational use, the\
  \ work  \ngroup  members  were considered to have completed work for the day and\
  \ were then free \nto leave  the site .  \n3.6. However , just as the RPO was preparing\
  \ to hand the site back to train control they were  \nappro ached by a signal s\
  \ technician who had been instructed to inspect some trackside \nequipment .  The\
  \  work being undertaken was within the PWA,  some distance away from \nthe RPO's\
  \ location  and out of line of sight .  \nThe incident  \n3.7. The RPO reported\
  \ that d uring their conversation with the signal s technician , the signals \n\
  technician stated  that they needed to examine a set of points , and asked the RPO\
  \ \nwhether it was necessary to lock on .  The lock -on procedure  would  have allow\
  \ ed the \nsignals technician to inspect the trac kside equipment safely. H owever\
  \ , this would have \nalso delayed the cancellation of the PWA .   \n3.8. The RPO\
  \ reported that they were unaware that the signal s technician was inspecting \n\
  points for potential  damage . Instead, they had  incorrectly assumed that the work\
  \ was \nrelated to removing the secondary protection in preparation for handing\
  \ the track back \nto train control .  As a result , the RPO responded that locking\
  \ on would not be required.  \n3.9. The RPO reported  that w hen the signals technician\
  \ requested access they were  focused \non clearing the work  group  from the PWA\
  \  so that the track could be handed back to \ntrain control .  Although the RPO\
  \ did not recall feeling any perceived pressure by the \nadditional time already\
  \ worked by the work group, handing the track back to train \ncontrol would have\
  \ allow ed the work  group to complete  their work .   \n3.10. The signal s technician\
  \ reportedly  did not advise the RPO that the work on the points \ncould  take some\
  \ time . The signals technic ian was also  of the view that the PWA c ould \n \n\
  \n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -101 not be handed back to train control\
  \ while secondary protection , which only the \ntechnician could remove,  was still\
  \ in place.   \n3.11. This series of misunderstandings and procedural lap ses allowed\
  \ t he signal s technician to \ncommence  carrying out work in the rail corridor\
  \ with a false sense of security .  Unknown \nto the technician , the RPO believed\
  \ that the technician was working clear of the track  and \nhad already advised\
  \ train control that electronic blocking could be removed.   Although \nthe secondary\
  \ protection was still in place , the removal of the electronic blocking \npotentially\
  \ put the signal s technician at risk from rail traffic  exiting nearby sidi ngs.\
  \ \nRisk controls  \n3.12. Several non-physical safety  barriers  were in place\
  \ to prevent unauthorised access to the \nPWA. These included:  \n\uF0B7 the promulgation\
  \ by KiwiRail of a  special bulletin for the work being undertaken , \nwhich specified\
  \ the type of protection required for the duration of that work  \n(Appendix 2).\
  \  The special bulletin also  stipulated the specific rules and conditions \nunder\
  \ which the work was to take place  \n\uF0B7 the content of the special bulletin\
  \ , which  was includ ed in the pre -start safety briefing \nattended by the RPO\
  \  \n\uF0B7 rules and procedures governing work within worksites , which  were in\
  \ place . All \npersonnel involved were trained in these rules and were qualified\
  \ to work on the track  \n\uF0B7 primary  protection  and secondary p rotection\
  \ , which  were  established in accordance \nwith the relevant rules and procedures.\
  \  The secondary protection (securing of points) \nwas also a physical barrier preventing\
  \ rail traffic entering the PWA.  \n3.13. These barriers  should have provided adequate\
  \ safe -working controls. However, their \neffectiveness was compromised by the\
  \ non -technical skills employed by the involved \npersonnel.  \nNon-technical skills\
  \  \n3.14. The Rail Safety and Standards Board of the United Kingdom  defines non\
  \ -technical skills \nas \"the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that\
  \ complement technical skills and \ncontribute to safe and efficient task performance\"\
  . While technical skills describe what \nyou need to do and know for a given safety\
  \ -critical task, n on-technical skills describe \nhow you do that task. The non\
  \ -technical skill components can be broken down further \ninto sub -categories\
  \ that include situational awareness, conscientiousness, \ncommunication, decision\
  \ -making and action, co -operation and working with others, \nworkload management\
  \ and self -management.  \n3.15. All the key personnel involved in this incident\
  \ had undergone  training in non -technical \nskills.  Nevertheless , the in cident\
  \ highlighted the importance of these skills in creating a \nsafe working environm\
  \ ent and ensuring that there are no misunderstandings  - \nparticular ly skills\
  \ in  communication, possessing a common mental model, challenge and \nresponse,\
  \ and situational awareness.    \n3.16. Had the signal s technician and RPO communicated\
  \ more effectively regarding t he nature  \nand potential implications  of the signals\
  \ technician's intended work , they would have \nlikely shared the same mental model\
  \ and understood the consequences o f the work \nrequirements.  This transfer of\
  \ knowledge would have also likely improved the RPO's \nFinal Report RO -2019 -101\
  \ \n<< Page 9 >>\n situational awareness and led to a better understanding of the\
  \ need to lock  on the \nsignal s technician.  \n3.17. There was a missed opportunity\
  \ for the  signals technician to challenge the RPO  on the \nnecessity to lock on\
  \ .  The challenge would have  also likely led to the RPO gaining a \nbetter understanding\
  \  of and greater clarity on the proposed work.  In addition, had the \nsignal s\
  \ technician advised the RPO that the work could  take some time , the RPO might\
  \  \nhave been prompted to decline access to the PWA.    \n3.18. Had each been better\
  \ aware of the other's needs , a simple solution such as the signal s \ntechnician\
  \ arranging for their own protection directly through  train control  was possible\
  \ .  \nThis would then have allowed the work  group to complete their work an d\
  \ depart.  \n3.19. Unfortunately , the challenge made by the train controller to\
  \ the RPO requesting the \nwhereabouts of the signal s technician went unheeded\
  \ . The RPO 's mental model was that \nthe technician was working clear of the track.\
  \ This challenge was a further opportunity \nfor the RPO to stop, reassess the environment\
  \ and regain situational awareness . \n3.20. All of the opportunities presented\
  \ above were instances where a better use of non -\ntechnical skills could have\
  \ minimised the likelihood of the incident occurring.  \n3.21. The Transport Accident\
  \ Investigation Commission (Commission) has raised the issue of \nnon-technical\
  \ skills in several rail occurrence reports , including  in a recommendation to\
  \ \nthe Chief Executive of the N Z Transport Agency (002/12 ): \nThe Commission\
  \ recommend s to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport \nAgency that (the agency)\
  \ require the Executive of the National Rail System \nStandard to develop standards\
  \ to ensure that all rail participants meet a \nconsistently high level of crew\
  \ resource management, and commu nication that \nincludes the use of standard rail\
  \ phraseology.  \n3.22. As a result of this  recommendation  KiwiRail implemented\
  \ training programmes that \nincluded the principles of non -technical skills. All\
  \ personnel involved in this incident had \nbeen trained to some extent in these\
  \ principles , but the incident highlight ed the \nimportance of continu ation training\
  \ to ensure that these principles  remain  prominent in \nthe wo rkers ' minds as\
  \ an important tool  in planning for any safe -working scenario.   \n3.23. On 3\
  \ April 2017 the NZ Transport Agency said it was continuing to work with KiwiRail\
  \ on \naddressing  the recommendation.  At the time of publication  the recommendation\
  \ \nremains open.  \n3.24. The Commission  does not intend to make  a further recommendation\
  \ on this matt er. \nOther potential factors considered  \n3.25. Shift-rosters \
  \ for all personnel were received by the Commission and were compliant with \nfatigue\
  \ management standards. Although the work period was extended by one hour , \nthere\
  \ was no evidence of fatigue  having been a factor in the occurrence . \n3.26. The\
  \ RPO undertook a drug and alcohol test soon after the occurrence. There was no\
  \ \nindication  of drugs or alcohol being a factor.  \n3.27. All personnel involved\
  \ had received the respective training and were qualified for the  \nroles they\
  \ were undertaking at the time of the occurrence.  \n  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>"
