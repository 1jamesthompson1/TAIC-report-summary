- name: Communication
  explanation: Communication is a critical non-technical skill that involves the exchange of information, clarification of tasks, and confirmation of actions to ensure mutual understanding. In the context of this accident, communication failures were a significant factor. The RPO and the signals technician did not effectively communicate the nature and potential implications of the technician's work, leading to a misunderstanding about the necessity of locking on for safety ("Had the signals technician and RPO communicated more effectively regarding the nature and potential implications of the signals technician's intended work" (3.16)). This lack of clear communication contributed to the RPO's incorrect assumption about the technician's work and the subsequent removal of electronic blocking, which put the technician at risk ("Instead, they had incorrectly assumed that the work was related to removing the secondary protection" (3.8)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and anticipating potential future states. It is relevant to this accident because the RPO lacked situational awareness regarding the signals technician's location and activities. The RPO believed the technician was working clear of the track and did not realize the technician was at risk when the electronic blocking was removed ("Unknown to the technician, the RPO believed that the technician was working clear of the track" (3.11)). This misunderstanding was a direct result of the RPO's lack of situational awareness, which could have been improved with better communication and a shared mental model of the work being undertaken ("this transfer of knowledge would have also likely improved the rpo's situational awareness" (3.16 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Procedural Adherence
  explanation: Procedural adherence refers to the consistent application of established protocols and procedures to maintain safety. In this incident, the RPO allowed the signals technician to enter the PWA without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902, which was a significant breach of safety protocol ("On this occasion the RPO allowed a signals technician to enter the PWA without following the procedure prescribed in rule 902" (3.2)). This lapse in procedural adherence was a direct contributor to the unsafe conditions that led to the accident.
- name: Non-Technical Skills Training
  explanation: Non-technical skills training encompasses the development of cognitive, social, and personal resource skills that complement technical skills. Despite all key personnel having undergone training in non-technical skills, the incident highlighted the importance of these skills in creating a safe working environment and preventing misunderstandings ("Nevertheless, the incident highlighted the importance of these skills in creating a safe working environment and ensuring that there are no misunderstandings" (3.15)). The failure to effectively apply non-technical skills, such as communication and situational awareness, was a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Challenge and Response
  explanation: Challenge and response is a safety practice where personnel are encouraged to question unclear or potentially unsafe situations and expect a clarification or correction. This practice was not effectively utilized in the incident, as there was a missed opportunity for the signals technician to challenge the RPO on the necessity to lock on, which could have led to a better understanding of the proposed work and potentially prevented the accident ("There was a missed opportunity for the signals technician to challenge the RPO on the necessity to lock on" (3.17)).
- name: Fatigue Management
  explanation: Fatigue management involves strategies to prevent accidents that may occur due to personnel being tired or overworked. Although the work period was extended by one hour, there was no evidence of fatigue having been a factor in this occurrence, indicating that fatigue management protocols were likely followed ("Although the work period was extended by one hour, there was no evidence of fatigue having been a factor in the occurrence" (3.25)). However, it remains a relevant safety theme as extended work periods can contribute to accidents if not properly managed.
