- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The flight crew's decision to use 'open descent' mode instead of 'managed descent' mode required a higher level of human intervention to keep the airplane within permissible limits on the arrival route. This decision, coupled with the lack of discussion about the progress of the airplane against the standard arrival route altitude restrictions, led to the airplane descending below a minimum altitude limit for the procedure (4.3.22). The crew's assumptions about the descent profile and their failure to maintain situational awareness contributed significantly to the incident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The captain's unfamiliarity with the route due to not having flown domestically within New Zealand for several years contributed to the incident (4.2.1). This indicates a potential gap in training or refresher training for routes that a pilot may not frequently operate, affecting their competency in managing the flight's descent profile.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The flight crew did not effectively use crew resource management principles, as evidenced by their failure to communicate and cross-check at key points, which are important for maintaining situational awareness (4.3.16). The pilots did not discuss their position on the procedure or confirm compliance with altitude restrictions, which could have prevented the descent below the minimum safe altitude (4.3.15).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The flight crew's decision to use open-descent mode and not actively follow the operator's procedures or use the onboard systems, such as the navigation display, to monitor their compliance with altitude restrictions, indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures (4.3.24). This deviation from standard operating procedures was a significant factor in the incident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate use of the airplane's automated navigation systems, which increased operational risk by placing more reliance on human performance (5.3). This suggests that the organizational safety culture may not have sufficiently emphasized the importance of using available automation to enhance safety.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The operator's procedures allowed for the use of open-descent mode without requiring the flight crew to set the FCU to the next intermediate altitude restriction, which meant that adherence to any altitude restriction relied less on the airplane's automation and more on the pilots' performance (4.3.7). This indicates a lack of comprehensive risk management and analysis in procedure design.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The air traffic controller observed the airplane's descent below the minimum safe altitude but did not follow the required procedures to alert the flight crew until the airplane had landed (5.4). This failure to comply with standard procedures indicates a lapse in regulatory oversight and compliance.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their airplane's location in relation to the standard arrival route, which led to the descent below the published minimum safe altitude (5.1). The loss of situational awareness was a direct contributor to the incident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'While the use of automation was a factor in the incident, it was not the automation itself but rather the choice of descent mode and the subsequent lack of monitoring that contributed to the descent below minimum altitudes. Therefore, the use of automation as a safety theme does not directly apply to the cause of the incident.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence in the provided document that a breakdown in communication between the flight crew and external parties, such as air traffic control, contributed to the incident. The issue was internal to the cockpit and related to the crew''s decision-making and monitoring.

    '
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide any information suggesting that fatigue management was a factor in the incident. Therefore, it is not applicable as a contributing safety theme.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that a lack of training or familiarity with the equipment contributed to the incident. The issue was related to the flight crew''s decision-making and use of the equipment rather than their understanding of it.

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Emergency response preparedness does not appear to be a factor in this incident, as there was no emergency situation that required a response. The issue was related to the descent profile during a standard arrival procedure.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that maintenance or inspection regimes were related to the incident. The focus was on the flight crew''s actions and decisions during the descent.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not mention weather conditions as a factor in the incident. The descent below minimum altitudes was not related to weather but to the flight crew''s management of the descent profile.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the incident. All relevant themes have been addressed.
