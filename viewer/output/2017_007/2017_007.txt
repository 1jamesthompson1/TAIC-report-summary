The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiri es is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regula tory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 1845 on 6 August 2017, an Airbus A320 aeroplane was approaching Christchurch 
with 128 passengers and six crew on board.  During the arrival procedure the aeroplane 
inadvertently  descended below the 2,500 -foot (760-metre) minimum  safe altitude for  part of 
the arr ival procedure.  
1.2. The infringement was noticed by the air traffic controller at the time, but the flight crew was 
not advised until the aeroplane had landed.  The aeroplane landed safely.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the aeroplane 
descended below a published  minimum safe altitude for a segment of the arrival procedure, 
because the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their aeroplane 's 
location  in relation to the standard arrival route.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the operator's procedures did not encou rage the appropriate  
use of the aeroplane's automated navigation systems , and that by electing to use an 'open 
descent' procedure rather than the available , fully automated 'managed desc ent' mode, and 
not setting the flight control unit to the next altitude restriction, a higher level of human 
intervention was required to keep the aeroplane within permissible limits on the arrival route.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that the air traffic cont roller observed the aeroplane 's descen t 
below the minimum safe altitude, but did not follow the required procedures and alert the 
flight crew until the aeroplane had landed.   
1.6. As a result of the safety actions  taken by the operator, no  new recommendations were 
identified.  
1.7. A key lesson  arising from th e inquiry is that properly  used automated flight navigation systems 
will reduce the crew workload and result in safer flight operations.  If crew choose not to use 
them, they must  maintain a  heightened level of alertness and work harder to achieve an 
equivalent level of situational awareness.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Because the a eroplane  involved was registered in Australia , the occurrence  was notified to the 
Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which  then  notified the C ommission  of the incident on 9 
August 2017 .  The Commission  obtain ed further information  before open ing an inquiry under 
section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , and appointed 
an investiga tor in charge.  
2.2. Air traffic control radar and flight data information was obtained  from Airways New Zealand.  
2.3. Investigators interviewed the two pilots  and t he two air traffic controllers who provided the 
radar service during the aircraft's approach to Christ church.  
2.4. Copies of the operating procedures for the operator , the air traffic control provider and other 
Airbus A320 operator s were obtained.  
2.5. On 6 July 2018 the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, representing the state of the operator, 
appointed an Accredited Representative to participate in the inquiry.   
2.6. Between July and October 2018 the operator provided additional informatio n to the 
Commission . 
2.7. On 12 December 2018 the Commission approved this draft report to be circulated to  
interested persons for comment.  
2.8. The Commission received seven  submissions on the draft report.  The Commission considered 
the submissions, and changes as a result of those s ubmissions have been included in the 
final report.  
2.9. On 27 March 2019  the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Sunday 6 August 2017 an Airbus A320 registered VH-VGY (the aeroplane) w as scheduled 
to fly from Christchurch to Wellington and return.  
3.1.2.  The captain was based in Melbourne and had flown as a passenger  to Christchurch the day 
before the occurrence.  The captain was familiar with flying between Australia and New 
Zealand, but had not flown domestical ly within New Zealand for several years.  Prior to the 
flight the captain had reviewed relevant aeronautical publications in preparation for the flights.  
3.1.3.  The first officer was based in Christchurch and regularly flew between Wellington and 
Christchurch.  
3.1.4.  The flight north from Christchurch to Wellington was uneventful .  The captain was the 'pilot 
flying'2 and the first officer was performing the duties of 'pilot monitoring'3.  The flight and 
instrument  approach were flown on auto pilot using the aeroplane's au to-flight and flight 
management systems.4  
3.1.5.  For the return trip south , the aeroplane departed Wellington about five minutes later than 
scheduled , at about 1825 .  The first officer was now the pilot flying and the captain was the 
pilot monitorin g.  When the aeroplane was near  Kaik ōura the crew obtained the latest 
Christchurch aerodrome and weather information.  This stated  that the crew could expect an  
instrument landing system/distance  measuring equipment (ILS/DME)5 approach to runway 
02.  The runw ay was dry with a surface wind of 300º magnetic at seven knots6, visibility of at 
least 40 kilometres and nil significant cloud7.  At that time the pilots could see the lights of 
Christchurch about 150  kilometres  ahead.  
3.1.6.  The aeroplane  was then  cleared by air traffic control  for a 'MESIX Five Alfa Arrival', which was 
the standard  arrival  route8 that led into the ILS/DME approach to  runway 02  at Christchurch  
(see Figure 1) .  The crew loaded the standard  arrival route and the expected  approach into the 
aeroplane's flight management guidance system (FMGS) and conducted a brief ing for the 
arrival , approach  and landing . 
3.1.7.  The standard arrival route included a number of altitude9 restrictions below which  an aircraft 
should not descend as it proceeded along the route. These minimum altitudes were  set for a 
number of reasons,  including  to provide a safe clearance above terrain and other features, for 
noise abatement, and to ensure efficient traffic flows.   Figure 2 shows the minimum altitudes 
for the approach route the aeroplane was following.  
3.1.8.  At 1834  the aeroplane  was cleared to descend , at the pilots' discretion , from flight level 240 
(24,000 feet /7,300 metres  [m]) to 11,000 feet  (3,300 m).  The first offi cer inform ed the 
captain of his intention  to delay the descent slightly  in order to fly a continuous descent at idle 
engine thrust, which would normally have allowed the aeroplane to meet all the 'at or above' 
altitude restrictions o f the standard arrival route .  To initiate the descent, the first officer 
select ed 'open descent' mode on the flight control unit (FCU)  (see Figure 3).  In open -descent 
mode t he aeroplane is still  flown by the autopilot, but the pilots manually control the vertical  
(altitude)  component of the flight  path .  This means the pilot is required  to ensure that the 
aeroplane complies with the altitude restrictions  for the standard arrival route , while t he 
                                                        
2 The pilot responsible for controlling the aircraft . 
3 The pilot responsible for monitoring the flight management and aircraft control actions of the pilot flying , 
and carry ing out support duties such as communications and checklist reading . 
4 Flight information, including arrival and approach procedures, is loaded into a flight management guidance 
system that, depending on the modes used, directs the aeroplane's flight path using the autopilot.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 3.1.9.  At 1839 the crew changed radio frequency to Christchurch Approach , and reported that they 
were descending to  11,000 feet.  The air traffic controller  (the controller) cleared the 
aeroplane  to continue the descen t via the standard arrival route to 4,000 feet  (1,200 m).  The 
controller also advised that they were  the second aircraft in the approach sequence.   The crew 
read back the clearance  correctly.   
3.1.10.  At 1846 the controller  instructed  the aeroplane  to descend via the standard arrival route to 
2,000 feet  (600 m) , and cleared it for the ILS/DME approach  to runway 02.  The crew set 
2,000 feet in the FCU and correctly read  back the clearance .  The air traff ic control radar 
record ed that at 1846:50 the aeroplane  passed overhead the GUKAM waypoint  at an altitude 
of 4,625 feet  (1,400 m) .  The captain later recalled that they had been  above the minimum 
altitude of 4,000 feet  when crossing GUKAM  
3.1.11.  Shortly after passing the GUKAM  waypoint and with the runway  lights in view, the first officer 
suggest ed to the captain that they request a visual approach10.  The captain  considered the 
suggestion then  instruct ed the first officer to continue with the standard arrival  route . 
3.1.12.  The aeroplane was required to remain above 3,000 feet (900 m) until it had passed the next 
waypoint11, GOMPI.  At 1848:32 the aeroplane  descend ed below 3,000 feet  before reaching 
the GOMPI waypoint12.  Additionally, the Christchurch standard arrival  route included a 
minimum safe  altitude of 2,500 f eet (760 m) between GUKAM and GOMPI .   
3.1.13.  The Manual of Air Traffic Services states that if a controller becomes aware or has reason to 
suspect that any aircraft operating under instrument flight rules13 is below the required 
obstacle clearance , the pilot shall be advised as soon as possible and every means shall be 
used to restore obstacle clearance as soon as possible.14  The required obstacle clearance 
included ra dar terrain separation and the minimum safe altitude  for the route . 
3.1.14.  At about 1850 the controller noticed that the aeroplane  was approaching the GOMPI  waypoint  
but was descending through  2,300 feet (700 m) .  The controller alert ed the planner in an 
adjacent seat and together they observe d the aeroplane  levelling at 2,000 feet.  At 1850:58 
the aeroplane  passe d the GOMPI  waypoint  at 2,000  feet.  The controller then instructed the 
crew to change to the aerodrome tower frequency for landing clearan ce. 
3.1.15.  After landing , the tower controller asked  the captain  to call the Airways Centre duty manager.  
The duty manager inform ed the captain that the flight had descended below 3,000 feet before 
the GOMPI waypoint  and therefore had gone below the minimum altitude for that segment of 
the standard arrival  route .  The captain had not been aware of the exceedance.

3.2. Personnel  information  
Captain  
3.2.1.  The captain had joined  the operator as a first officer in September 200 5, flying  Airbus A320 
and A330 aeroplanes , and had been  promoted to  captain in June 2009.    
3.2.2.  The captain held an  Australian air line transport pilot licence (aeroplane) and had accrued a 
total of about 32,000 flying hours, including about 8,000 hours on the A320 type of 
aeroplane .  The captain's 'class 1' medical certificate , issued on 15 May 2017 , was current 
and included a requirement that he  wear glasses , which he reportedly did.  The captain's 
previous  flight check had been  on 14 September 2016 and previous simulator check on 15 
May 2017.  
First officer  
3.2.3.  The first officer  had flown  with a New Zealand operator  for two years before joining the 
operator in August 2016 as a first officer on A320 aeroplanes.   The first officer had accrued a 
total of 5,620 flying hours, including 680 hours on the A320 type of aeroplane.  
3.2.4.  The first officer held both New Zealand and Au stralian air line transport pilot licence s.  The first 
officer held a current 'class 1' medical certificate issued on 19 June 2017, with no 
restrictions.  The first officer's previous flight check had been  on 12 April 2017 and previous 
simulator check on 26  April 2017.  
3.3. Aircraft and operator information  
3.3.1.  VH-VGY was an Airbus A320 -232 aeroplane, manufactured in 2010  and d elivered new to the 
operator.  The aeroplane was powered by two IAE V2527 -A5 turbofan engines and was 
configured to carry 1 80 passengers.   
Flight management  
3.3.2.  The A320 aeroplane was normally flown using the auto -flight  system s, following a route and 
vertical profile that ha d been pre -programmed in to the aeroplane's FMGS.  When the FMGS 
follow ed the flight  path and speed profiles calculated by the FMGS, the guidance was said to 
be 'managed' .  When the flight crew set temporary flight -path parameters , such as heading or 
speed, the FMGS guidance was said to be 'selected'.  
3.3.3.  For a 'managed descent ' and approach, the flight crew load ed into the FMGS  the appropriate 
arrival procedure , instrument approach and predicted winds.  The aeroplane then follow ed a 
descent profile (vertical navigation) and track (lateral navigation) computed by the FMGS.  In 
managed -descent mode the FMGS ensure d compliance with  any altitude restrict ion or speed 
limit included in  the programmed arrival and approach procedures.   The pilots were able to

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 monitor the aeroplane's position on the programmed  route , and any altitude restrictions on 
their navigation display.  
3.3.4.  In 'selected descent ' mode, pilots  control led the aeroplane's descent using the FCU located on 
the instrument panel.  The operator's standard operating procedures stated that pilots could 
use one of two modes for selected descents: open descent or vertical speed.  In open-descent 
mode an aeroplane would descen d to the altitude selected by the pilots  on the FCU .  The 
FMGS would then disregard a ny intervening altitude restrictions  that had been  pre-
programmed into the FMGS as part of the arrival procedure.  However, the restrictions  would 
continue to  be shown on the navigation displays  and the aeroplane would remain on the pre-
programmed route  (see Figure 4).

Previous  occurrence  
3.3.5.  On 16 July 2012 another of the operator's A320 aeroplanes had been  cleared to descend as 
part of an Area Navigation (Required Navigation Performance) approach15 into Queenstown.  
The pilots  had been  concerned about potential strong tailw inds, so they had begun the 
descent in open -descent mode with the intention of reverting to managed -descent mode for 
the instrument approach .  However, in that case the crew had forgotten  to revert to the 
managed -descent  mode and the aeroplane had descended below an approach segme nt 
minimum safe altitude.  The crew  had recognised this and immediately c limbed to re gain the 
required approach path.  
3.3.6.  An investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau had determined that "contrary to 
their intenti ons, the pilots  continued descent with the auto -flight system in open -descent

procedure's segment minimum safe altitudes" .16  Contributory factors included:  
 a reliance on 'prospective memory ', despite its limitations, to remind the pilots  to switch 
from open -descent mode to managed -descent  mode  
 the pilots  not maintaining awareness of the descent profile in relation to the instrument 
approach procedure's segment minimum safe alt itudes  
 the pilots  not strictly adhering to the operator's sterile flight deck procedures  
 the operator's procedures  provid ing limited protection against descent through an 
instrument approach procedure's segment minimum safe altitudes . 
3.3.7.  As a result of the o ccurrence the Australian Transp ort Safety Bureau  had commented that the 
operator had provided additional guidance material for pilots to help ensure there was a 
better awareness of autopilot modes.  The operator had also stated in the report that:  
Approach charts specify minimum segment altitudes prior to the VIP [vertical 
intercept point].  Managed descent mode provides protection against infringing 
these minimum altitudes.  If selected modes are used, pilots must exercise caution 
in complying with  these altitudes.  It is strongly recommended that pilots use 
managed descent mode in preference to selected vertical modes, especially when 
re-intercepting the ve rtical path from above the VIP.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The flight was a scheduled passenger service between Wellington and Christchurch , operating 
under instrument flight rules .  As the aeroplane approached Christchurch it descended  below 
minimum altitudes on two accounts.  First , it descended below the clearance limit of 3,000 
feet before reachi ng the GOMPI waypoint .  Second, it descended below the  minimum safe 
altitude  of 2,500 f eet.  
4.1.2.  Minimum clearance and safe altitudes are set for a good reason : to provide a safety margin  
between aircraft and terrain or obstacles.  When an a ircraft  breaches these limits , it is 
operating one step closer to a serious incident or accident.  When an air traffic services safety 
system does not detect or respond to this type of breach , there is a risk of such events 
becoming normalised and undermining the safety of t he system.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses what happened and how relying less on aircraft automation 
and more on human performance can increase the risk to safe flight operations in some 
cases.  
4.2. Descent below minimum permitted  altitude  
4.2.1.  The captain had not flown domestically within New Zealand for s everal years , and was 
therefore less familiar with flying between  Wellington and Christchurch than the first officer.  
4.2.2.  The first officer was more familiar with the route .  It had also become common practice for the  
first officer to delay  commencing the descen t into Christchurch and to set the aeroplane's 
navigation systems to open -descent mode before commen cing the instrument approach.   
Using open -descent mode was not inconsistent with the operator's standard operating 
procedures.  
4.2.3.  In open -descent mode the aeroplane was programmed to descend directly to the altitude set 
in the FCU  (2,000 feet) , ignoring the intermediate altitude restrictions  contained in the 
standard arrival route .  The first officer had used th is descent profile previously  at 
Christchurch and was confident of being able to maintain a steady descent to the 
commencement altitude for the  instrument  approach.  
4.2.4.  However , on this occasion the aeroplane descended below the intended profile and 
consequently below the 3,000 -foot minim um altitude limit between GUKAM and GOMPI , and 
also below the 2,500 -foot minimum safe altitude limit until past GOMPI .  The 3,000 -foot limit 
was a procedur e limit, while the  2,500 -foot minimum safe altitude limit prov ided separat ion 
from  terra in along the GUKAM -to-GOMPI track.  
4.3. Defences   
4.3.1.  To help ensure  that arrival procedure requirements were met, a range of safeguards was 
available to the flight crew, including:  
 the FMGS  
 the navigation display  
 the operator's standard operating procedures  
 crew resource management17 
 air traffic control . 
                                                        
17 The effective use of all available re sources for flight crew personnel to  assure a safe and efficient 
operation, reducing error, avoiding stress and increasing efficiency .

 Flight management guidance system  
4.3.2.  The FMGS , when used in 'managed -descent ' mode , automatically direct s an aeroplane  to 
follow a  programmed  arrival procedure  and en sures that it remains within the allowable limits .  
Little pilot input is required because  the auto -flight system control s the a eroplane .  When  
open-descent mode is used , the aeroplane  follow s the same lateral navigation element, but 
the FMGS command s a descen t directly to the altitude the pilot sets in the FCU.  The pilot is 
then required to ensure  that the aeroplane  remains above any intermediate altitude  
restrictions .   
4.3.3.  The operator advised that  open -descent mode was regularly used by pilots in both Australia 
and New Zealand, and no specific descent mode was preferred .  Each mode ha d its 
advantages and limitations .  For example , managed -descent  mode cannot  be used  during 
radar vectoring , where a contro ller give s heading, and probably altitude, instructions for the 
aeroplane to  follow.   
4.3.4.  The operator 's procedures  did not  require pilots using open -descent mode to reset the FCU to 
the next intermediate altitude  restriction .  The operator explained  that rese tting the FCU to 
each intermediate altitude restriction during a descent could  cause issues with mode 
reversion and reduce the efficien cy of the descent profile because  the aeroplane  attempts to 
capture each altitude.   If the FCU is reset to the next altitude restriction just as the aircraft  
approaches the current limit,  the pitch mode of the autopilot may change or revert from either 
managed or selected open -descent  mode to vertical -speed mode, which can cause 
confusion.18  The operator advised that it had had " many " instances of mode reversion.  
4.3.5.  The Commission reviewed the f light management procedures for two other operators that flew 
the A320.  One operator advised that its pilots were directed to fly in managed -descent  mode 
where possible, and were only to use open -descent  mode in exceptional circumstances.  
Should an open descent be flown , pilots were required to set the FCU altitude to the next 
intermediate altitude or restriction .  This FCU requirement was also contained in the descent 
procedures for the third  operator . 
4.3.6.  The procedures for each of the three operator s all referred to  the same information on mode 
reversion  provided by the manufacturer, Airbus .  However, t he deputy training manag er 
responsible for A320 standards and training  for one of the operators explained  that mode 
reversion was not a significant issue  for them.  Th e manager explain ed that this was likely 
because their  pilots didn't often conduct open descent s, and thus their pilots were probably  
more proactive in managing descent s, which would include  resetting the FCU to avoid any 
incompatibility.  If a mode reversion occur red, the pilots were immediately aware of it and 
reacted accordingly.  
4.3.7.  Jetstar did not have  procedures requiring the FCU be set  to the next intermediate altitude 
restriction, which  meant that adherence to any altitude restriction relied less on the 
aeroplane's automation and more on the pilots' performance.   This is discussed further in the 
following sectio ns. 
Navigation display      
4.3.8.  The FMGS  and the auto -flight system  are intended to ea se a pilot's workload, allowing the 
crew to focus on ensuring  the continued safe operation of the a eroplane .  In managed -descent  
mode the FMGS follows a programme d procedure.   However, i n some conditions  the 
aeroplane  may deviate from the planned  flight  path.  To protect against this, pilots need to  
monitor the performance of their aeroplane  continually , and intervene  to avoid any  potential  
limit exceedance.   For the A320, t his monitoring  information is presented to the pilots by a 
number of means, primarily the navigation display.  
                                                        
18 The Airbus flight crew operating manual states that when the FCU altitude is set to "a target not compatible 
with the a ctive open mode, a mode reversion occurs and V/S [vertical speed]  engages on current V/S".

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 4.3.9.  The n avigation display provide s a pilot with a view of the intended track the aeroplane is 
programme d to fly, and the position of the aeroplane alo ng that track  (see Figure 4 ).19  The 
display can also show any restrictions  along the track, for example not below 3,000 feet until 
past GOMPI .  By checking the navigation display, including a vertical situation display if 
fitted20, and if required cross -checking this against the procedure chart, a pilot should be able 
to confirm  quickly  their position on the procedure and that they are compl ying with any 
restriction . 
4.3.10.  This information was available to the pilots on the aeroplane 's navigation display, but w as 
either not refer red to by the pilots or not clearly appreciated . 
Standard operating procedures   
4.3.11.  Standard operating procedures  help to promote safety through consistency of performance 
and efficiency, while reducing miscommunication and non -compliance.  Standard operating 
procedures  have been developed to cover every aspect of flight deck activity , embracing 
normal, abnormal and emergency situations.   
4.3.12.  The operator's procedures included reference s to Airbus' s 'Golden Rules ', which "take into 
account the p rinciples of flight crew interaction with automated systems, and the principles of 
crew resource management" (discussed in the next section ). The Golden Rules are:  
1. Fly, Navigate and Communicate  
2. Use the appropriate level of Automation at all times  
3. Understand the Flight Mode Annunciator  
4. Take action if things do not go as expected.  
4.3.13.  In following these rules, the crew could have given more consideration to the captain's 
unfamiliarity with the route and the standard arrival route  being flown, and therefo re used the 
full automation available.  However, descending in open -descent  mode would have worked 
had the pilots followed rule #1 and cross -referred to their approach chart and navigation 
display to confirm their progress and predict the aeroplane's posit ion in relation to minimum 
safe altitudes  (commonly referred to as 'staying ahead of the aeroplane' ).   
Crew resource management  
4.3.14.  Crew resource management  recognises the integral role of each crew member, flight crew and 
cabin crew in achieving a safe flight .  Major airlines train crew members in crew resource 
management , focus ing on interpersonal communication, leadership and decision -making.  
4.3.15.  The aeroplane was approximately  600 feet (180 m) above the minimum altitude restriction  of 
4,000 feet as it flew over  the GUKAM  waypoint .  It was then that the pilots needed to check 
the next altitude restriction , as depicted on the approach chart and thei r navigation displays, 
and ensure that the restriction would be met .  The pilots later acknowledged that if they did do 
this they did not discuss it with each other . 
4.3.16.  Communication and cross -checking at key points are important for pilots maintaining 
situat ional awareness21 and are an important aspect of crew resource management.  
                                                        
19 This complements the arrival chart (Figure 2) carried on the aeroplane.  
20 A vertical situation display provides a profile view of an aircraft along its programmed descent path, and 
can include terrain.  
21 The perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of  time and space, the comprehension 
of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future .

  Air traffic control  
4.3.17.  In this incident the controller observed an aeroplane that had descended below the next 
waypoint altitude limit of 3,000 feet and the route minimum sa fe altitude  limit of 2,500 feet.  
There were no complicating circumstances in terms of traffic flow or density.  
4.3.18.  The Manual of Air Traffic Services sets out the procedures for respond ing to air traffic 
situations.  The preface to the manual states that it is not pract icable for the document to 
cater for all combinations of air traffic situations, and that controllers are to use their 
judgement.  However, in a straightforward  situation with no complicating circumstances, the 
controller has no reason to deviate from the standard procedure.  
4.3.19.  In this case the standard procedure was to inform the crew  immediately  and direct a climb , or 
at least to alert the aeroplane crew to the exceedance.  The controller took neither of these 
actions.22  The controller and planne r said they had observed the aeroplane level at 2,000 
feet and, seeing that it was not descending further , the controller decided not to alert the crew 
for concern it might distract them at a critical phase of the flight . 
4.3.20.  When it is appropriate to do so,  controllers should normally  follow standard procedures .  To do 
otherwise would risk normalising non -standard responses to air traffic situations , which could 
result in a permanent reduction in safety standards.  
Summary  
4.3.21.  Had the arrival procedure been flown in  managed -descent  mode, all procedure requirements 
would highly likely have been achieved.  However, the flight crew, as permitted by the 
operator's procedures, elected to use open -descent  mode and to set the FCU altitude to the 
final altitude cleared by ai r traffic control .  However, the controller gave the pilots clearance to 
2,000 feet via the standard arrival route.  The standard arrival route included several 
intermediate altitude restriction s along the arrival route.  Had the pilots opted to use 
manage d-descent mode, the aeroplane would automatically have levelled off rather than 
descend below any of the intermediate altitude restrictions, the aeroplane's automation thus 
providing an additional defence against the aeroplane exceeding published minima.  
4.3.22.  The crew instead opted to fly in open -descent  mode, which required them to either manually 
enter  the intermediate minimum altitudes or continuously monitor the aeroplane's progress 
along the approach path and intervene manually to ensure it remain ed above minima.  
However, t he crew did not discuss the progress of the aeroplane against the standard arrival 
route altitude restrictions .  As a result , they did not detect that the  aeroplane had descend ed 
below a minimum altitude limit  for the procedure . 
4.3.23.  The Australian Transp ort Safety Bureau  investigation into the similar 2012 incident involving 
the same operator  had identified mode awareness as a central issue .  The  crew in that case 
had relied on their prospective memory to remember to change the mode fr om open descent 
to managed descent  once they had regained the intended flight  path .  The crew had 
subsequently forgot ten to chan ge mode and the aeroplane had descended  below the 
approach altitude restrictions for two of the segments of the arrival procedure . A missed mode 
change was not the issue in this latest incident , as the flight crew deliberately selected open -
descent  mode and intended to maintain that unti l partway through  the arrival procedure.  
Rather the issue  was the flight crew not maint aining full situational awareness .    
4.3.24.  The crew  could have followed the operator's procedures  more actively  and used the on -board 
systems, such as the navigation display, to 'stay ahead ' of the aeroplane .  This was especially 
so as the aeroplane  descended in open -descent  mode, with the automated defences that 
would have been available in managed -descent mode now disabled.  As the aeroplane passed 
each segment of the arrival procedure they should have  refer red to the navigation chart or 
                                                        
22 Aircraft operating under radar control and flying the same route could be approved to operate as low as 
2,000 feet, with a minimum radar terrain separation of 1,600 feet (487 m) around GOMPI.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 display and  remind ed themselves of the next restriction , and ensure d that the aeroplane 
would meet  it. 
4.3.25.  There is nothing wrong with following such an arrival procedure using the open -descent mode.  
However, the aircraft automation in managed -descent mode provides an i mportant defence 
against aircraft descending below minima .  Using  open -descent mode relies more heavily on 
crew performance to manage the de scent, so if it is to be used, operators need to have  
procedures that ensure a high standard of  crew resource manage ment to provide a 
comparable level of flight safety.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The aeroplane descended below a published minimum s afe altitude for a segment of the 
arrival procedure , because the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of 
their aeroplane's location  in relation to the standard arrival route.  
5.2. The flight crew elected to use an 'open descent' procedure rather than the available , fully 
automated 'managed descent ' mode , which required a higher level of human intervention to 
keep the ae roplane within permissible limits on the arrival route.  
5.3. The operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate  use of the aeroplane's 
automated navigation systems ; this  increased operational risk by placing more reliance on 
human performance.  
5.4. The air traffic controller observed the aeroplane 's descen t below the minimum safe altitude, 
but did not follow the required procedure s and alert the flight crew until the aeroplane had 
landed.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the re gulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. The operator produced an internal report into this occurre nce.  The report highlighted the use 
of the Airbus 'Golden Rules ', which are:  
1. Fly, Navigate and Communicate  
2. Use the appropriate level of Automation at all times  
3. Understand the Flight Mode Annunciator  
4. Take action if things do not go as expected.  
6.3. The operato r's report found that the captain and first office r, because of their different 
experience levels and familiarity with the local procedures , developed different mental mode ls 
of the approach.  The pilots did not use the appropriate level of automation and allowed 
themselves to be distracted from monitoring the arrival procedure.  
6.4. The operator's internal report resulted in a Flight Standing Order being issued , effective 23 
February 2018.  The order included a revised procedure for flight -path monitoring and 
discussed such topics as pilot duties, monitoring and communication.  
6.5. On 3 March 2018 the operator  provided its training and check staff  with further information 
and discussi on on the subjects described in the previous paragraph.   
6.6. The operator also advised that on 1 October 2018 it had transitioned its flight crew training to 
evidence -based training .  Evidence -based training  recognises that most occurrences have an 
element of reduced situational awareness and can be effective in improving the defences 
against this human condition. E vidence -based training  moves away from scripted simulator 
training programmes to unknown -scenar io-based activities that focus on problem -solving, crew 
resource management , threat and error management and resilience.

 Final Report AO -2017 -007 8. Key lesson  
8.1. Properly used automated flight navigation systems will reduce the crew workload and result in 
safer flight operations.  If crew choose not to use them , they must maintain a heightened level 
of alertness and work harder to achieve an equivalent level of sit uational awareness.
