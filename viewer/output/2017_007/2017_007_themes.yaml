- name: Use of Automation
  explanation: The use of automation is a safety theme relevant to this accident because the flight crew elected to use an 'open descent' procedure rather than the fully automated 'managed descent' mode. This decision required a higher level of human intervention to keep the airplane within permissible limits on the arrival route ("The flight crew elected to use an 'open descent' procedure rather than the available, fully automated 'managed descent' mode" (5.2)). The reliance on manual monitoring over automated systems increased operational risk by placing more reliance on human performance ("this increased operational risk by placing more reliance on human performance" (5.3)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness is a critical safety theme in this accident as the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their airplane's location in relation to the standard arrival route, leading to the descent below the published minimum safe altitude ("The aeroplane descended below a published minimum safe altitude for a segment of the arrival procedure, because the flight crew did not maintain adequate situational awareness of their aeroplane's location in relation to the standard arrival route" (5.1)). The crew's lack of situational awareness was a direct contributor to the altitude breach ("Rather the issue was the flight crew not maintaining full situational awareness" (4.3.23)).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  explanation: Crew resource management (CRM) is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. CRM involves the effective use of all available resources for flight crew personnel to assure a safe and efficient operation, reducing error, avoiding stress, and increasing efficiency ("crew resource management" (4.3.1)). The flight crew's failure to communicate and cross-check at key points, which are important aspects of CRM, contributed to the loss of situational awareness and non-compliance with altitude restrictions ("Communication and cross-checking at key points are important for pilots maintaining situational awareness" (4.3.16)).
- name: Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) is a safety theme because the operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate use of the airplane's automated navigation systems, which increased the reliance on human performance ("The operator's procedures did not encourage the appropriate use of the aeroplane's automated navigation systems" (5.3)). The flight crew's deviation from SOPs by not using managed-descent mode and not actively using on-board systems like the navigation display to monitor their compliance with altitude restrictions was a factor in the incident ("The crew could have followed the operator's procedures more actively" (4.3.24)).
- name: Air Traffic Control Procedures
  explanation: Air traffic control (ATC) procedures are a relevant safety theme as the air traffic controller observed the airplane's descent below the minimum safe altitude but did not follow the required procedures to alert the flight crew until after the airplane had landed ("The air traffic controller observed the aeroplane's descent below the minimum safe altitude, but did not follow the required procedures and alert the flight crew until the aeroplane had landed" (5.4)). The controller's inaction and deviation from standard procedure could have compromised safety and contributed to the normalization of non-standard responses to air traffic situations ("To do otherwise would risk normalising non-standard responses to air traffic situations" (4.3.20)).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Routes
  explanation: Training and familiarity with routes is a safety theme because the captain's lack of recent experience flying domestically within New Zealand and unfamiliarity with the route between Wellington and Christchurch contributed to the incident ("The captain had not flown domestically within New Zealand for several years, and was therefore less familiar with flying between Wellington and Christchurch than the first officer" (4.2.1)). This lack of familiarity may have affected the crew's ability to manage the descent profile effectively and maintain situational awareness ("In following these rules, the crew could have given more consideration to the captain's unfamiliarity with the route" (4.3.13)).
