- safety_issue: 'The flight crew''s reliance on open-descent mode without adequately monitoring and ensuring compliance with intermediate altitude restrictions led to the aircraft descending below the minimum permitted altitude.

    '
  quality: inferred
- safety_issue: 'The operator''s procedures did not require pilots using open-descent mode to reset the Flight Control Unit (FCU) to the next intermediate altitude restriction, which could reduce the effectiveness of descent management and increase the risk of altitude breaches.

- safety_issue: 'The lack of a requirement for flight crews to actively use onboard systems, such as the navigation display, to monitor the aircraft''s compliance with altitude restrictions during descent in open-descent mode, potentially compromises situational awareness and flight safety.

    '

- safety_issue: 'Air traffic control''s failure to alert the flight crew immediately upon observing the aircraft descending below the minimum altitude restrictions represents a missed opportunity to prevent or mitigate the altitude breach.
