The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and inciden ts with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for th at purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a  stand ing commission of inquiry 
and an  independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from t ransport accidents and incidents.

<< Page 1 >>
 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 23 January 2015  a Robinson R44 helicopter was being used to spray gorse near Waikaia.  The 
pilot was making repeated spray runs and turning the  helicopter  through 180 degrees  at the end of 
each run to position the helicopter for the next spray run.  
1.2. The helicopter had just completed a turn when the pilot  felt an unusual and significant vibration .  
The pilot  landed  the helicopter  immediately and di scovered a large crack in one of the main rotor 
blades.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the point of origin of the 
crack in the main rotor blade had features consistent with metal fatigue , and that the crack was 
not the result of any manufacturing defects in the materials or in the construction of the blade.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the helicopter had been operated primarily for agricultural flying, 
with the engine power likely  to have exceeded  the allowable  limit at times .  The types of turn used 
by the operator during spraying operations , especially when  the helicopter  was close to the 
maximum permitted all-up weight , likely subjected the main rotor blades to additional stresses  not 
envisaged by the manufacture r. 
1.5. The helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying.  The manufacturer had therefore 
not been required to consider the increased loads and cycles of agricultural flying when calculating 
the service life of the rotor blades.   
1.6. A safety i ssue  identified during the inquiry  was that a ircraft design organisations d id not have to 
consider whether proposed major modifications to an aircraft w ould significantly alter the use of 
the aircraft or adversely affect the service lif e of any component .   
1.7. The Commission recommend ed that the Director of Civil Aviation :  
 consult the original equipment manufacturer when considering a modification or 
supplemental type certificate that, if approved, could result in any aircraft being used in a way 
that was significantly different from that which the manufacturer originally modelled and used 
as the basis for determining component fatigue life and the aircraft maintenance programme.  
1.8. The key lesson s identified during the inquiry into this occurrence were:  
 metal fatigue occurs continuously in dynamic components.  A fatigue crack can lengthen 
rapidly and the component lose its structural strength.  If an unusual or severe vibration 
develops in  flight, the pilot should land immediately and have the helicopter inspect ed before 
further flight  
 the key to minimising stress in dynamic components is to fly conservatively, especially when 
operating close to the published  weight, speed and power limits.  The Commission has noted 
in previous inquiry reports that o perating an a ircraft outside the published  limitations 
significantly erodes the safety margins factored into the service lives of components and can 
quickly lead to an early  catastrophic  failure  
 operators and maintainers of aircraft that are subjected to cycles or flig ht profiles that are 
significantly different from those  envisaged by the manufacturer s when the aircraft were 
certificated should consider implementing shorter  intervals for component inspections and 
earlier component replacement times.

 Final Report AO-2015-003 2. Conduct of the in quiry  
2.1. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) became aware of this  main rotor 
blade cracking incident when advised by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) during the course of the 
Commission's inquiry into a n accident involving another R obinson R44 helicopter  the following 
month  (February 2015 ). 
2.2. An inquiry was subsequently opened on 25 February 2015 under section 13 of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990.   By this stage the CAA had already sent both of the 
main rotor blades to the Uni ted States for in spection by the manufacturer , Robinson Helicopter 
Company (Robinson) . 
2.3. The United States, as the state of manufacture of the helicopter and in accordance with Annex 13 
to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, appo inted an investigator from the National 
Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) as its Accredited Representative to the inquiry.  The 
Commission requested the Accredited Representative to oversee the inspections and examinations 
of the main rotor blades in the United States.  
2.4. Contact was established through the Accredited Representative with the aircraft manufacturer, and 
with the local airworthiness authority, the Federal Aviation A dministration  (FAA).  A visual inspection 
of the cracked blade was completed at t he Robinson factory , with representatives of the NTSB and 
the FAA present . The examination notes were reviewed by the  Commission's  investigator in charge.  
2.5. In early March 2015 the Commission's investigator in charge interviewed the pilot of the helicopter 
and the chief pilot for the operator . 
2.6. The Commission received a  set of time -expired  main rotor blades from another R44  that had been 
frequently used for agricultural operations.   These main rotor blades were inspected  by staff of the 
New Zealand Defence  Force, using non -destructive methods , to check for any fatigue cracks in the 
same area where the crack had occurred  on the incident blade.  
2.7. At the request of the Commission, Robinson  undertook a series of flight tests in a n R44 fitted with 
strain gauges on the  main rotor blades, to measure the stresses in the rotor bla des in normal flight 
as well as  during simulated agricultural spraying operations . 
2.8. The NTSB used a scanning electron microscope to  examin e the crack ed blade  and looked for 
indications of cracking on the other blade in the set .  The Commission engaged the Defence 
Technology Agency of New Zealand to review the report produced by the NTSB.  
2.9. Statistical data relating to the operation of agricultural helicopters in New Zealand was obtain ed 
from the CAA a nd forwarded to Robinson  for the purposes of blade stress analysis.  
2.10.  On 24 August 2017 the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to interested p ersons  
for co mment .  The Commission received five submissions, and changes as a result of these were  
included in the final report . 
2.11.  On 13 December 2017  the Commission approved the publication of the final report.   
2.12.  On 18 July 2018, as a result of  a further submission from the operator, the Commission resumed 
the inquiry  and appointed a new investigator in charge .  An expert metallurgist in New Zealand 
examined both main rotor blades from the incident helicopter and the investigators  made further 
enquiries.  A senior investigator of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau  independent ly review ed 
the evidential  basis for aspects of the original report  and the evidence obtained from the further 
enquiries . 
2.13.  The Commission considered the information from these further e nquiries and changes were 
reflected in a n amended  draft report.  
2.14.  On 20 February  2019  the Commissio n approved a draft amended report to be circulated to 
interested persons for comment.   The Commission received three submissions , and changes as a 
result of these have been included in the final amended report.

 Final Report AO-2015-003 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 23 January 2015  the pilot was  to spray  gorse on  a block of land near the operato r's base at 
Waikaia. The pilot conducted a pre -flight  inspection of the helicopter , including the rotor blades , 
before  the st art of the day 's flying.   No irregularities  were noted  during this inspection.   The pilot 
completed about three hours of flying that morning without incident.  
3.1.2.  At about midday,  after a downhill spraying run with a light load, the pilot made a turn at about  30 
knots2 airspeed .  When pull ing out of the turn at an airspeed of 10 -15 knots, the pilot felt a n 
unusual and severe vibration , but had no difficulty in maintaining control.  
3.1.3.  The vibra tion began when the helicopter  was about 200 metres from the landing site , so the pilot 
elected to land there.  After landing , ground staff  noticed an abnormal movement of  one of the 
main rotor blades, so t he pilot shut  down the  helicopter immediately.  The helicopt er was inspected 
and a large crack noticed on the lower surface of one of the main rotor blades , extending from the 
trailing edge to just behind the 'D spar3' leading edge  (see Figure s 1 and 2).  
3.1.4.  The helicopter was taken out of service and both m ain rotor blades were removed.  The  blades 
were shipped to the Robinson  factory in the United States for detailed inspection . Here  it was noted 
that the crack appeared to have started in a radius in the trailing edge where the chord  length4 of 
the blade in creased , known as the 'chord transition5' (see Figures 2 and 3).

3.1.5.  A section of  the blade (part number  C016 -7, serial number  2031 ) that contained the crack  was 
removed and  sent to th e NTSB laboratory, along w ith a similar  section from  the opposi te blade .  A 
detailed laboratory examination was carried out  and a report was provided to the Commission (see 
Appendix 1).

3.1.6.  No material defects were found in the area of the fracture initiation  in the aluminium skin , nor were 
there any relevant gaps or failures  in the associat ed epoxy adhesive .  The chemical compositions 
and characteristics of t he cracked blade materials  matched the design specifications . 
3.1.7.  The section from  the opposi te blade was visually examined.  No indications of  cracking or damage  
were found .  The chord tran sition inboard radius was measured and it conformed  with design 
specifications .  
3.1.8.  For comparison , the Defence Technology Agency of the  New Zealand Defence  Force6 check ed two 
C016 -7 main rotor blades  that had been u sed exclusively o n agricultural operations  and had  
reached their service lives  of 2,200 hours.  The blades were  subjected to eddy current7 and X-ray 
inspection s in the chord transition area .  No cracks were found, although indications of minor 
corrosion were discovered at the trailing edge of one b lade.  
3.2. Personnel information  
3.2.1.  The pilot of the incident he licopter had been employed initially as ground crew for  the operator , and 
had been flying for the operator  since September 2012 .  The pilot had been  issued with  a 
commercial pilot 's licence ( helicopte r) in August 2010 , and h ad logged a total of 1 ,630 flight  hours , 
of which 1 ,173 hours had been  on the R44.  The pilot's  most recent  line chec k had been  
conducted in December 2013 , and the most recent  flight crew compe tency check had been made  
in February 2 014.  The pilot  held a current Class 1 medical certificate.

 3.3. Aircraft information    
3.3.1.  ZK-HPC was a Ro binson R44 Raven II four -seat helicopter, with a maximum all -up weight8 of 1,134 
kilograms.  It had been issued with an airworthiness certificate  in the Stan dard Category , but had 
to be operated in the Restricted Category when the agricultural spray system9 was installed.  In 
effect, t he category change required o perations to be conducted under Civil Aviation Ru les (CAR) 
Part 137, Agricultural Aircraft Operati ons.  
  
3.3.2.  The helicopter was primarily used i n an agricultural role for  spraying liquid s.  The spray  system  
comprised : two spray booms ; two tanks  (one either side of the fuselage ); and a pump powered by a 
small petrol engine .  The total  capacity of the helic opter spray tanks was approximately 500 
litres ,10 but helicopter performance and weight limitations meant that less than ha lf of this capacity 
could be carried .  Each spray tank had a contents sight gauge marked  in litres.  
3.3.3.  The main rotor blade s were part nu mber C016 -7 'Revision AD' blades with aluminium top and 
bottom skins and an internal  aluminiu m 'honeycomb'  bonded to a load -bearing stainless -steel  'D 
spar'.   Each  blade 's trailing edge wa s formed by bonding  the upper and lower skins with structural 
epoxy adhesive.  A stainless -steel doubler11 was bonded between the upper and lower skins  at the 
trailing edge  (see Figures 4 and 5).  The doubler terminated  at about two -thirds of the length of the 
trailing edge from the blade root.  A fillet of flexible epoxy sealant  along the rear edge  of the bond 
line provided  protection  from corrosion .

8 The limiting weight specified by the manufacturer and not to be exceeded . 
9 The spray system ha d been designed  by an approved  New Zealand aircraft design o rganisation.  
10 The tank was designed to be much larger than the actual volume of liquid that could legally be carried, to allow for 'foaming' 
of the liquid to be contained inside the tank.  
11 An additional piece of material used to strengthen the area of surrounding structure in a component.

3.3.4.  The main rotor blades  had been  imported  into New Zealand in July 2012  and installed on  the 
helicopter in  March 2013  after having accru ed 15.5 flight hours  on another helicopter .  They had 
accrued  a further 831.5 flight hours in the 22  months in which they were  fitted to the incident 
helicopter.  The operator had experienced no prior defects  or damage with this blade  set.

3.3.5.  The R44  was originally produced with  part number C016 -2 main r otor blades  with stainless -steel  
skins.  The blade  planform12 for the later model R44 R aven II was changed  to increase the chord 
length of the outer section of the blade s.  The increased blade area produce d more lift and allow ed 
operations at heavier gross weights.   All R44 blades incorporated stainless -steel trailing -edge 
doubler s that terminated inboard of the chord transition (see Figure 5).   
3.3.6.  On 3 January 2008, p rompted by reports of de -bond ing13 on blades  with stainless -steel skins , the 
FAA issued airworthiness directive14 (AD) AD 2007 -26-12.  This AD  requir ed a one -time visual 
inspection for skin separation on the lower surface of each blade .  
3.3.7.  On 2 June 2011 the AD was superseded by AD 2011 -12-10, which requir ed pilots to check the 
blade skin -to-spar joi nt area for any bare metal before the first flight of each day. Additionally, 
within 10 hours ' time in service , and thereafter at 100 -hour intervals or at each annual inspection, 
or if any bare metal were  found during the pilot check, blades were to be ins pected for corrosion, 
separation, gaps or dents by following certain procedures in R obinson's  service bulletins (SBs).15

 C016 -7 aluminium -skinned blades  
3.3.8.  In 2007  Robinson  developed a new C016 -7 main rotor  blade to resolve  the skin separation and 
erosion iss ues with the R44  main rotor blades .  The primary design change was the replacement of 
the stainless -steel  skins  with aluminium skins . 
3.3.9.  On 9 January 2015 FAA AD 2014 -23-16 mandated  the replacement within five years of all 
stainless -steel  blades in service with the new aluminium blades .  The e mbodiment of t his AD 
removed the inspection  requirements of AD 2011 -12-10.  Robinson  exchange d part-life stainless -
steel  blades for discounted new C016 -7 blades.   
Actions a fter the  incident  
3.3.10.  On 31 January 2015  the CAA issu ed Continuing Airworthiness Notice16 62-003, which contained  
details  of th is incident  and photographs o f the failed blade.  The notice  alerted operators to any 
unusual vibration , and recommended that blades be checked  for defects  at every pre -flight 
inspect ion. 
3.3.11.  On 23 February 20 15 Robinson  issued a safety alert17 (see Appendix 3), which detailed  the 
location  of the  incident blade 's crack  and recommend ed close visual inspec tions of the trailing 
edges of blades  during daily pre-flight inspection s.  In addition , the FAA issued Special 
Airworthiness Information Bulletin SW -15-08, which reiterated  the content of the safety alert. 
3.3.12.  The CAA subsequently issued AD DCA/R44/32, which mandated  the inspection requirements of 
the Robinson safety alert and required  an additi onal visual inspection  before each flight . 
3.3.13.  On 30 March 2015 the  safety alert was superseded by Robinson SB-89, which requir ed C016 -7 
blades to be modified  by increasing the radius of the inboard chord length transition  (see Appendix 
4).  On 31 March 2015 t he FAA issued 'Revision 1 ' of Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin 
SW-15-08, which included  the content of SB -89. 
3.3.14.  In New Zealand, the CAA issued  DCA/R44/32C, effective on 24 September 2015 .  This revision  
prescribed the modification actio ns outlined in SB -89, and specified  that the modification was to 
be completed by 19 March 2016.  The visual inspection requirements  were also clarified in this 
revision  to the AD .  
3.3.15.  Robinson change d the C016 -7 production design  to 'Revision AF' (25 March 2015) , which  included 
the re-profiled  trailing edge at the chord length transition , similar  to that achieved by  SB-89.  
'Revision AG' (31 March  2015) shifted the chord transition inboard  by approximately six inches  (")  
(15.2  centimetres) , to overlap the trailing edge d oubler  (see Figure 6).  The reasons for and effect s 
of these changes are discussed in section 4.5.

3.3.16.  On 27 May 2016 t he FAA i ssued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM -81 FR 33609, May -27-
2016 ) for a new AD  that includ ed a one -time inspection of Robin son R44 (and R66 ) main rotor 
blades .  The NPRM state d, in part , that :  
This proposed AD would require a  one-time visual i nspection of the main rotor blade 
(MRB) and either removing or altering it. This proposed AD is prompted by a report that a 
fatigue crack was found at an MRB 's trailing edge and a determination that some MRBs 
may have reduced blade thickness due to blendin g out corrosion. The proposed actions 
are intended to prevent an MRB fatigue crack, which could lead to MRB failure and 
subsequent loss of helicopter control.  
3.3.17.  According to the FAA, it did not initially consider th e New Zealand incident an airworthiness co ncern 
that warrant ed an AD.   Following reports of corr osion that had remained undetected  between 
scheduled inspections, and further repo rts that blending had  been carried out in the area of the 
chord transition radius to remove the corrosion, the  FAA re-evaluated the situation .  It determined  

 
Final Report AO-2015-003 
<< Page 11 >>
 that the presence of corrosion  or blending of  the trailing edge could reduce the safety ma rgins 
below an acceptable level . 
3.3.18.  The NPRM proposed that the  modification required  by SB -89 would correct this u nsafe condition 
and help to prevent  fatigue cracks.   The proposed AD would be carried out within 100 hours ' time 
in service or at the next annual inspection, whichever c ame first.  The NPRM was subsequently 
accepted,  and AD 2016 -26-04 became effective on 8 February  2017.  
3.4. Tests and research  
3.4.1.  Three independent metallurgical inspections and examination s were carried out in support of this 
inquiry .  They are described in section 4.2  with further detail in Appendices 1 and 2.  
3.4.2.  After the incident R obinson  fitted  an R44 helicopter w ith test equipment  to measure the stress es 
on the  chord transition radius of the  main rotor blades  in normal flight , and during simulated 
agricultural spraying operations .  Turns of  low to moderate severity  were performed , as well as 
'cyclic procedure  turns'.18 These turns were conducted  at high all -up weights but without spray 
equipment installed.   The results of these flights are discussed in section 4.3. 
3.4.3.  The CAA  review ed statistical data pertaining to R44 agricultural helicopter operations in New 
Zealand for the years 2014 and 2015 to determine the average loads and cycles per hour for R44 
helicopters used for  spraying .  The data was sourced  from statistical information required to be  
reported by all aircraft operators in New Zealand , and from the quarterl y operational statistics19 
submitted by agricultural operators .  The data included total weights  and volumes  of products 
applied , load cycles and breakdown s of flight  hours . 
3.5. Organisational and management information  
3.5.1.  The company  had operated  Robinson helicop ters since 2006  and had owned the incident 
helicopter for three  years  prior to the incident .  The helicopter had been operated  for between  600 
and 700 flight hours a year, with  most  of th at time  on spraying operations.  The helicopter had also 
been used  for training,  stock mustering and solid fertiliser application.  The pilot and the chief pilot  
had flown the helicopter on a regular basis.  
3.5.2.  The two pilots stated  that for agricultural operations the helicopter was  usually  configured for  the 
maximum all -up w eight  at take-off, and carried  sufficient fuel for  40 minutes of flight .  The 
maximum payload20  that could be carried , depending  on the weight of the pilot  and the specific 
gravity21 of the product , was about 250 litres .  The volume of liquid (water mixed with the product ) 
put into the spray tanks  was controlled through a flowmeter  on the filler hose .  At each turnaround 
the loader would check that the tanks were empty before refilling  them with the maximum payload 
permissible , based on the operating weight of the helicopter22 and the specific gravity of the liquid . 
3.5.3.  Both pilots described different methods of turning the helicopter by 180 degrees at the end of each 
spray run , depending on the weight of the helicopter and the helicopter speed during the spray ru n.  
The weight of the helicopter progressively reduced as the agricultural product was dispersed on 
each spray run.  The speed of the helicopter could  vary depending on the concentration of the 
product being applied.  
3.5.4.  Wider turns were made when the helicopt er was heavy and/or it was flying at high speeds.  When 
the helicopter was lighter the pilots refer red to sometimes using a technique to reverse the 
direction of the helicopter more quickly in preparation for the next spray run.  They referred to 
these  as 'advanced turn s', where the helicopter was pulled up until reaching near to or zero 
                                                        
18 A cyclic procedure turn  is wher e the helicopter is turned aroun d 180 degrees  in a relatively wide , flat arc using the cyclic 
flight control  only. These  turns impose minimal  added stress es on the dynamic components of the helicopter.  
19 Quarterly operational statistics are required to be submitted by CAR Part 137 Agricu ltural Aircraft O perat ions operators , and 
the data includes the amount of products applied and the area covered . It is  not normally checked for accuracy.

helicopter around the main rotor mast until it was aligned with the next spray  run. 
3.5.5.  The operator estimated that on average  the helicopter accrue d 10-12 take-offs23 per hour , and 
sometimes up to  25 per hour , during spraying operations .  The pilots stated that they usually used 
'maximum allowable' engine power during take-offs and b etween 23 inches  of mercury ( Hg)24 and 
24″ Hg for the spray runs .   
3.6. Additional information  
Safety information  
3.6.1.  The manufacturer and national airworthiness authorities had issued a number of safety notices, 
gazette articles and airworthiness bulletins  to highl ight the dangers of overloading and 
overstressing helicopter dynamic components, particularly during agricultural flying.  
3.6.2.  In December 2001 Robinson  had issued Safety Notice SN -37 - Exceeding Approved Limitations 
Can Be Fatal  (see Appendix 5).  The safety n otice explain ed, in general terms, fatigue failure s in 
helicopter com ponents and the likely causes.  A copy of this safety notice is  included in the pilot's 
operating handbook  carried in each helicopter .  
3.6.3.  The March/April 2005 issue of Vector  magazine25 included an article entitled 'Ag Work and the 
R22'.   The article discussed the implications of using the Robinson R22 for agricultural operations 
in respect of loading limits and main rotor blade fatigue.   The similarities between the R22 and the 
larger R44, i ncluding the main rotor design s, meant that this article was  relevant to operators of 
R44 helicopters in the agricultural role.  
3.6.4.  In May 2006 t he Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia  had issued  Airworthiness Bulletin AWB 
02-015 Helicopter - Effects o f Fatigue on Life Limited Components.   The purpose of the bulletin 
was to "advise operators and maintenance organisations that the fatigue life of life -limited 
components may be adversely affected, or the safety margin reduced, depending on the operation 
and type of loading history that the c omponents experience during  its service life" (see Appendix 
6). 
3.6.5.  One of the recommendations  in the bulletin  was that operators of aircraf t engaged in agricultural  
flying , cattle mustering , or operations with  more than fo ur rotor full stops per flight hour  consult the 
manufacturer s and give full de tails of all operations for possible component life-limit revision s.

engine.  The pressure is  regulated by the thrott le setting.  The absolute maximum take -off power is marked on the manifold

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Main rotor blade failures are rare, but can be  catastrophic.  In this case the fai lure occurred at low 
level and near a suitable landing site, which enabled the pilot to land safely .  
4.1.2.  Cause s of rotor blade failure have  included  improper maintenance or material or manufacturing 
defects, although overloading an d high stress and vibration s have  also led to fatigue cracking .  This 
failure was a type that had not occurred before and the failed blade had logged only 847 hours in 
service, well below the 2,200 -hour service life.  
4.1.3.  This analysis describes the metallurgical tests performed on the failed blade , and examines the 
nature of agricultural flying .  The cause of the failure was not determined conclusively, but the 
incident underlined the potential for intensive agricultural operations to contribut e to component 
fatigue . 
4.1.4.  The fitting of a spray system  to the R44 was a major modification that change d the usage of the 
helicopter and subjected it to flight stresses that had not been envisaged by the helicopter  
manufacturer.  The analysis discusses this  safety issue .  Aircraft design organisation s did not have 
to consider whether proposed  major modification s to an aircraft would significantly alter the use of 
the aircraft or adversely affect the service li fe of any component.  
4.1.5.  The analysis also discusses operators and pilots not always knowing and adhering to  the published 
limitations for their aircraft , an issue that  has been raised in a previous Commission report.  
4.2. Metallurgical inspections and examinations  
4.2.1.  Three independent metallurgical inspections and examinations were under taken for this inquir y: 
 The cracked main rotor blade and its paired blade were inspected at the Robinson factory with 
representatives of the NTSB and FAA present.  Both blade s were later examined in the NTSB 
materials laboratory .  This is discussed further in paragraph 4.2.2.  
 The section of cracked blade and the matching portion of its paired blade were examined by a n 
expert metallurgist at Quest Integrity NZL  Limited  (Quest) .26  This is discussed further in 
paragraph 4.2. 6. 
 New Zealand Defence Force  experts  used X-ray and other  non-destructive inspection methods 
to look for evidence of fatigue on a set of time -expired main rotor blades taken from another 
R44 that had been used almost exclusively on agricultural operations.  Within the limits of the 
inspection techniques employed , no defects were identified . 
NTSB examination  
4.2.2.  The NTSB laboratory examination  report  is included in Appendix 1.  The examination determined 
that the crack s contained  features consistent with  fatigue  failure , and that their  origin was  likely to 
have been at the trailing edge  where  the upper and lower skins were bonded  (see Figure 8 ).  The 
portion of the fracture surface consistent with fatigue cracking was 3.65 ″ (9.3 centimetres ) in 
length and exhibited features typical of progressive crack growth.  The remai nder of the fracture 
exhibited mixed -mode27 cracking , then  a pure over stress  failure  (see F igure 9). 
                                                        
26 The Quest examination was undertaken three years after that by the NTSB.

4.2.3.  The NTSB examination report concluded that there were no manufacturing defects in the materials 
or in the construction of the blade, with all components of the blade meeting the design 
specifications.  The materials experts from  the NTSB also  stated that the crack may have started in 
the epoxy sealant that coated the trailing edge, and that it could have spread into the aluminium 
skin from there.  The epoxy sealant was not intended to be a structural or load -bearing component 
of the blade and was designed to flex with it.  However, if the blade flex ed significantly in service 
under cyclic loa ds, it is possible that the epoxy cracked first, creating a further stress concentration 
at that location.  
4.2.4.  The NTSB al so visually inspected the paired  blade in the vicinity of the chord transition  and found 
"no indication of cracks, dents, or other damage.   No anomalies were seen  in the underlying 
sealant or alumin ium skins ".

Independent New Zealand examination  
4.2.5.  The Quest examination report is included in Appendix 2.   The fracture section (which had been 
prepared  for the earlier NTSB examination) was examined with a scanning electron microscope.  
The report commented:  
The location of the origin, at the inner corner at the trailing edge of the aluminium 
layers does strongly suggest that part of the loading is due t o bending or flexing 
around the minor axis of the blade section.  It is understood that the nominal loading 
at this point is a combination of centrifugal loading from rotation, and bending/flexing 
around the major axis of the blade cross section due to aer odynamic loading.  The 
additional bending load required to initiate a crack at the apparent location may be 
due to a particular vibrational mode in the blade, excited by other loads applied to the 
blade.  
The absence of any visible defects at the crack orig ins strongly suggests that the 
fatigue crack was caused by an applied load in excess of the capacity of the blade to 
meet the designed/designated fatigue life.  The applied load would be a combination 
of varying centrifugal, aerodynamic and possibly vibrat ional stresses, resulting in the 
initiation and propagation of a fatigue crack at a critical location on the blade trailing 
edge (the stress concentration formed by the trailing edge transition).  
4.2.6.  Quest  also inspected the paired  blade from the helicopter f or any sign of cracking or overstress in 
the area of the chord transition.  As sectioning of the area was not feasible, Quest could only 
remove all coatings from the chord transition area and remove shallow surface defects  before 
making a visual examination .  Quest reported that "no defects or discontinuities were seen in the 
aluminium layers at the transition radius where the crack in the other blade had initiated. "  Quest 
further commented:  
Although both blades would have seen similar aerodynamic and mecha nical loads in 
service, the absence of a fatigue crack in one blade does suggest a quantifiable 
difference between the two blades.  This may be [due to] one or more of the following:  
 marginally stronger material, adhesive or fabrication resulted in a grea ter 
margin against fatigue crack initiation  

 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO-2015-003  slight variations in fabrication and/or installation in the blade assembly 
resulted in a marginally different vibration response from the same loading, 
compared to the fractured blade, resulting in a slightly low er cyclic load, and 
hence no crack initiation or propagation at the time of removal from service . 
Finding s  
1. There were no manufacturing defects in the materials or in the construction of the 
blade , and the examined components of the blade met the design sp ecifications.  
2. The point of origin of the crack  in the main rotor blade trailing edge had features 
consistent with metal fatigue.  
 
4.3. Operational factors  considered  
Overloading  
4.3.1.  Rotor b lade failures that are caused by  flying overweight , or excessive main rotor  revolutions per 
minute (RPM) ,28 typically involve crack s located closer to the blade root29 where bending and 
centrifugal  forces are at their highest.  However,  this failure occurred at a different location, closer 
to the t ip of the blade  where  the chord le ngth transition s and twisting forces are greater .   
4.3.2.  A comparison of the operational  statistical returns30 for the operator with those of other operators 
that used R44s for spraying  did not indicate that the maximum all -up weight  had been exceed ed in 
service .  The a verage  load for the incident helicopter while on agricultural operations was 
consistent  with the industry  average in  New Zealand . 
Power settings  
4.3.3.  The chief pilot stated that their pilots used the maximum allowable power for take -off.  The 
maximum al lowable take -off power was determined by adding a fixed increment of 2.8″ Hg to the 
maximum continuous power permitted for the existing conditions of pressure altitude and outside 
air temperature.  The pilot's operating handbook contained a table, which was also displayed in the 
cockpit , that showed the maximum continuous powe r for different conditions (see Figure 10).  
  
                                                        
28 A high rotor RPM  increase s the centri fugal force on the blade, which is also a function of the weight of the blade, so the 
stress will  be higher towards the blade root where it is attached to the hub . 
29 Where the main rotor blade is attached to the main rotor head at the top of the mast . 
30 Agricultural operators are required to submit three -monthly returns to the CAA that contain the number of hours flown, the 
number of loads carried, the amount of product applied in tonnes or litres and the area covered in hectares.

Engine power limits

4.3.4.  The absolute maximum ('red line') power of 26.1 ″ Hg applied only when the outside air 
temperature was 40  degrees Celsi us (°C) (at sea level (from Figure 10: 23.3 ″ Hg plus 2.8 ″ Hg).  The 
operator was based in the lower South Island where temperatures were relatively low, and would 
almost certainly never have flown  under those conditions.  They would have been  more likely t o fly 
in temperatures between 0°C and 20°C at altitudes between sea level and 2 ,000 feet .  Under 
those conditions, the maximum take -off power would have been  between 24.6 ″ Hg and 25.7 ″ Hg.  
At interview, neither pilot could state the red line value.  The p ilots' statements about using 
maximum allowable power without having a correct awareness of the red line value or allowing for 
the ambient conditions suggested that they would likely have inadvertently exceeded at times the 
pilot's operating handbook  limit for maximum take -off power.  
4.3.5.  The chief pilot said they operated the aircraft up to the limit, but not all the time, and not over the 
limit.  The chief pilot said during the first interview that the power required during take -off was 23 -
24″ Hg, and up to 26 ″ Hg on occasions.  The power was then reduced to about 20 ″ Hg for the spray 
runs.  The maximum continuous power setting was 23.3 ″ Hg.  Therefore it is very likely that the 
engine was inadvertently run at high power settings at times while the helicopter was spraying . 
4.3.6.  Although Robinson  had set limits on the engine manifold pressure  and the engine had been 
'derated'31 from its maximum  power output, it was possible for pilots to demand more engine 
power than the helicopter's  dynamic componen ts were designed to absorb.   It was therefore 
possible  to over stress the helicopter by  exceeding the power limit for the ambient conditions . 
4.3.7.  The integrity of component s will be compromised if they are subjected to excessive  stress.  A single 
instance of ov er-stress may be sufficient to cause damage .  The accumul ation of fatigue can be 
rapid and  reach  the point of failure before early detection is possible .  Robinson Safety Notice SN-
37 (see Appendix 5), which is included in the pilot's operating handbook of every Robinson 
helicopter,  highlighted  the detrimental effects of  excessive  loading  and engine  power settings  on 
the service life of dynamic  components . 
Turns 
4.3.8.  The in-flight strain survey  carried out by R obinson  included  manoeuvres commonly used  during 
agricultural flying .  Turns typically used between s pray runs , with cyclic and collective pull -ups of 
low to moderate severity , were performed during the flight testing .  A direct c omparison with some 
of the turn techniques used by the operator could not be a chieved , because Robinson  did not 
exactly replicate the same turn technique  during its testing  and the test aircraft did not have spray 
equipment fitted .  From the in-flight strain survey , Robinson  found that:  
                                                        
31 The Lycoming IO -540 was originally used in fixed -wing aircraft and produced 300 horsepower at t ake-off, whereas in the 
R44 the power  was limited to about 245 horsepower.  

 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO-2015-003 The stresses were just below the level where t hey would contribute to fatigue damage. It 
is likely therefore that if the helicopter exceeded the maximum gross weight and/or the 
turns were performed more aggressively the loads would be damaging.  
4.3.9.  According to industry feedback, some of the turn techniq ues used by the operator were  not widely 
used  during spraying operations , and were not taught during basic agricultural flight training .  A 
characteristic of these types of turn is that the helicopter reverses the direction in which it is 
heading  while it has zero airspeed.  If the turn is initiated earlier while the helicopter is still 
climbing , the heading of the helicopter  during the latter part of the climb  is not aligned with  the 
flight path .  
4.3.10.  During th is type of  turn the helicopter  change s from flying  forwards to flying sideways , and possibly 
to flying  backwards  if the turn is initiated early enough.  The helicopter must then translat e to flying 
forward  again .  Consequently  the turn can take place  for the most part in 'transitional flight '.32  
According to a technical report that studied  helicopter loads, fatigue and design, published by the 
Australian Department of Defence 's Defence  Science and Technology Organisation 's Aeronautical 
Research Laboratory in 1993 : 
'Transitional flight ' generates the highest  vibratory stresses. When comparing to a 'transport mission', 
'crop spraying' gives approximately the same rotor blade fatigue life, unless prolonged 'transitional 
flight ' is included in the spectrum, in which case the fatigue life becomes less than half t he life of the 
transport mission.  The main rotor blades respond to transient loading by flapping, leading , lagging and 
twisting.  
4.3.11.  For a considerable period during such a  turn there is reduced  translational lift33 as the helicopter 
airspeed reduce s and the direction of the flight path is reversed .  This type of turn differs from a 
conventional ' teardrop  turn'  where airspeed and therefore translational lift are conserved .  
4.3.12.  In re gard to  the consequence s of this  type of manoeuvring , Robinson  stated : 
Since the re lationship between loads and fatigue is exponential it is  possible that 
operation consistently over maximum gross weight or excessively aggressive turns could 
cause an order of magnitude reduction34 in fatigue life .   
4.3.13.  Robinson  advised that the dominant vari able in main rotor blade fatigue damage is blade angle of 
attack, which results in large variations in chord -wise bending loads.   At the maximum all -up 
weight,  pulling out of an aggressive  turn requires  significant increases  in blade pitch angle s (angles 
of attack)  and engine power , along with an increase in  gravity loading .  The effect of increased 
aerodynamic forces  and the loading  of the blade s during  aggressive  agricultural manoeuvres is the 
likely mechanism for  the metal fatigue acc umulation  result ing in a significant fatigue  penalty.  
Exceeding aircraft limits  
4.3.14.  The operator's pilots had inadvertently used engine power settings that were likely , at times , to 
have been above the maximum allowable for the ambient conditions . 
4.3.15.  The Commission noted in a previo us inquiry report35 that New Zealand's helicopter accident rate 
was higher than that of other aviation sectors, and that there had been public criticism of how 
helicopters were  operated in New Zealand, including a culture of operating outside the 
manufactur ers' published and placarded 'never exceed' limitations.  It noted that t here was a 
possibility that such a culture had become normalised.  The core safety issue would therefore lie 
within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on effects to individual ope rators' safety systems.  
4.3.16.  In the previous inquiry report, t he Commission  did not make a recommendation because it  was 
aware that the CAA was reviewing the 'sector risk profile' of commercial helicopter and small

 aeroplane operations, and had already recommen ded that the Director of Civil Aviation include the 
safety issue of helicopter operational culture in that review.  
Finding s 
3. The helicopter had been flown mostly on spraying operations at high power settings, 
which were likely to have exceeded  the allowable  limit at times.  The high power 
settings subjected the helicopter dynamic components to higher stress than they 
were designed for.  
4. The types of turn used during  spraying , particularly  when  the helicopter was at heavy 
weight s, likely subjected the main rot or blade s to stres ses above those for which the 
blades were designed  and contributed to  the onset of  fatigue a t the chord transition 
radius.  
 
4.4. Fatigue and cycle calculations during certification  
4.4.1.  Aircraft components are subject to a wide variety of mechanic al and environmental stresses, and 
are particularly susceptible to accumulated fatigue.  The continued safe operation of aircraft 
requires manufacturers to determine the expected lives  of critical component s.  With that 
knowledge , appropriate inspection an d replacement schedules can be implemented  to ensure that 
components are replaced well before they are likely to fail in service.  
4.4.2.  Robinson  specified  that one engine and rotor 'stop-start '36 was equivalent to one ' fatigue cycle'  on 
the blade .  This definitio n was used  in its calculations to  forecast component reliability, determine 
fatigue  life and publish  service  life limits .  Robinson  advised  that during  the assessment of fatigue 
during main rotor blade design and certification , a rate of  six stop-start cycles per flight hour  was 
assumed.   That cycle rate was combined with t he in-flight fatigue spectrum37 and the stress -cycle 
curve38 for the blade  to produce t he blade's fatigue life39 of 4, 000 hours  (24,000 cycles) .  After 
applying a  safety margin , 2,200 hours (13,200 cycles) was specified for the main rotor blade 
service  life.40  
4.4.3.  Figures provided by the operator  showed that  the helicopter flew an average of 1 2.5 product  loads 
per hour  during spraying,  and about  15 turns between spray runs were conducted during t he 
application  of each load .  Robinson submitted that the fatigue damage depended on the 
magnitude of the stress cycle , and that the damage associated with a n aggressive turn was 
significantly less than  that associated with  a ground -air-ground cycle .  Howe ver, stress cycles are 
accumulated more quickly during agricultural flying than they are during a 'standard' flight profile.  
4.4.4.  The type of flight operation performed affects the fatigue lives  of helicopter components .  A Civil 
Aviation Safety Authority  of Au stralia bulletin41 (see Appendix 6) describe d how component  fatigue 
life may be affected by : 
 operation of helicopters  in agricultural operations where high loads may be 
encountered more frequently than envisaged by the manufacturer  
 operations where there ar e a high number of landings and take -offs per hour  
 frequent operations at or near maximum all up weight.  
                                                        
36 One cycle  is taken from the rotors start ing to rotat e until they  stop rotati ng after engine shut -down.  
37 The fatigue spectrum is developed from in -flight stresses recorded during a 'standard'  flight profile, which  involves the 
normal manoeuvres expected in  air transport, private an d training flights, but not in agricultural fl ying.  
38 The s tress life of a component  is derived from testing the component with a specific load for a number of cycles until it fails. 
Tests are carried out at increasing loads that result in fewer  cycles until failure. The results are plotted on a chart to produce an 
'S-N' curve .  This determines the fatigue limit , the point ( applied  load) at which any number  (or for certain materials a very high 
number, typically 107) of cycles will not result in component failure.  
39 The minimum numb er of stop -start cycles and flight hours that stress  (fatigue spectrum loads ) can be applied to a 
comp onent before a failure could  occur.  
40 Finite or safe life is a usage limit specified for a component, in hours or calendar time, after which time it must be discar ded. 
It is significantly lower than the fatigue life to ensure that the component will not fa il in service . 
41 airworthiness bulletin (AWB 02 -015)  
 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO-2015-003 4.4.5.  The bulletin  also stated that fatigue damage is accelerated when the cyclic loads on a component 
are of greater magnitude and frequency than envisaged during the design of the component.   The 
standard flight profiles used by Robinson  to de termine  the fatigue s pectrum for the R44  blades did 
not include the types of manoeuvre  or number of cycles associated with agricultural flying.  
Therefore Robinson 's fatigue -life calculations and safe -life limits  for components used in standard 
flight operations  were unlikely to be valid for helicopters routinely used for  agricultural operations.  
4.4.6.  After the incident Robinson  recalculated the fatigue life of R44 main rotor  blade s used in 
agricultural operations, using  an increased stop-start cycle rate of 10  per hour .  The  fatigue life 
reduced from 4 ,000 hours  to 3,400 ho urs.  However, Robinson  determined  that the safe life of 
2,200 hours would not need to be reduced becaus e an adequate safety margin still remain ed. 
4.4.7.  In contrast, t he engine manufacturer  had previously recognised that agricultural flying results in 
greater stresses in components, and had reduced the time between overhaul  for engines used in 
aircraft performing  that role.  The standard  engine fit ted to an R44 normally has an overhaul period  
of 2,000 hours .  However , if the helicopter is used for agricultural flying this is reduced to 1 ,500 
hours.  T his limitation was introduced  by the engine manufacturer  because  of the increased 
stresses  during high  power setti ngs at heavier  weights, and the associat ed reduction in the 
expected service lives  of the engine 's components.  
4.4.8.  The Quest examination of the fractured blade found evidence of high cycle fatigue.  Small 
differences in material properties result in a variation in fatigue life between samples/objects that 
experience the same loading conditions.  That is l ikely the reason for one blade failing before there 
was any indication of fatigue damage in the other blade.  
Finding  
5. The helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying.  The manufacturer 
had therefore not been required to consider the increased loads and cycles of 
agricultural flying when calculating the service  life of the rotor blades.  
 
4.5. Desig n factors  
4.5.1.  During the course of the inquiry, it was suggested  to the Commission that the main rotor blade 
crack was the result of a failure in main rotor blade design.  It was submitted that the presence of a 
design flaw was supported  by Robinson subsequent ly modifying  the main rotor blade to reduce the 
stress concentration around the chord transition, where this failure occurred.  
4.5.2.  This incident is the only recorded  case  of fatigue cracking in  the chord length transition  radius of a 
C016 -7 main rotor blade .  The fracture of the blade at the chord transition indicated that in -service 
stresses at the chord transition were higher than Robinson had anticipated.  The critical stress 
location on the main rotor blade had shifted from being near the blade root, where it had been on 
earlier versions of the blade.  However, Robinson advised that u nder design operating conditions 
the shift would not have been an issue, because even allowing for the additional stress of intensive 
agricultural operations, Robinson had calcu lated that there was still an adequate margin above the 
2,200 hours ' stated service life.  
4.5.3.  The 'Revision AG' blade incorporated  a move of the chord length transition inboard of the stainless 
steel doubler termination.  Robinson advised that this change was  to provide a strength margin in 
case of corrosion or damage at or near the transition radius (see Figure 6).  
4.5.4.  The design change  Robinson made as a result has improve d the blade's safety margin for fatigue 
resistance .  FAA AD  2016 -26-04 and CAA AD DCA/R44/ 32C have  mandate d the field service 
modification specified in Safety Bulletin SB -89, which is  an interim measure until the blades are 
replaced.  Although t he full benefits of the design improvements can only be achieved by 
replacement with 'Revision AG' bl ades, Robinson advised that SB -89 restores the calculated 
fatigue life for early revision blades to that of the new 'Revision AG' blade . 
4.5.5.  Therefore, the Commission does not consider that the fatigue cracking was the result of a design 
'flaw'.  If it had be en, there would have been more reco rded cases of fatigue cracking in the many 
 
Final Report AO-2015-003 
<< Page 21 >>
 other blades in service, many of which had significantly more accumulated hours in service than 
those fitted to the incident helicopter . 
4.5.6.  It is considered  that the higher -than -normal stresses imparted on the blades during agricultural 
operations are likely to have  culminated in a fatigue crack developing in the area  of the blade  most 
susceptible to those type s of stressor.   The modification of the blade design by Robinson was to 
increase the design margin in case trailing -edge damage occurred to the blade , or the particular 
helicopter operations exceed ed the number of cycle s and the nature of stresses envisaged when 
designing the life cycle s of components.  
Finding  
6. 'Revision AE' and earlier C016 -7 main rotor blades  had a small  radius in the 
trailing edge chord length transition .  This  created a higher stress concentration in 
this area and reduced the safety margin before fatigue cracking  would occur . 
4.6. Major aircraft  modifications  and role changes  
Safety issue: Aircraft design organisations d id not have to consider whether proposed major 
modifications to an aircraft w ould significantly alter the use of the aircraft or adversely affect the 
service life of any component . 
4.6.1.  The install ation of spray e quipment on the helicopter  was a major modification  that had been  
approved by a  design organisation certificated under  CAR Part 146  Aircraft Design Organisations - 
Certification .  An aircraft design organisation holds a delegation  from the CAA to approve design 
changes and aircraft modifications.  CAR Part 21  Certification of Products and Parts  requires all 
designs and design changes to be approved by the Director of Ci vil Aviation, but the Civil Aviation 
Act 1990 allows this to  be delega ted to other acceptable persons .  CAR Part 146 provides details 
of the requirements for acceptable persons  and the certification and operati ng procedures for 
design organisations.  
4.6.2.  Under CAR Part 146, an aircraft  design organisation  shall  ensure  that its designs a nd design 
changes have no "unsafe features ", and shall  establish procedures to:  
 test and inspect specimens to [of] the type design to show compliance with airworthiness 
design standards: and  
 produce, check, and control reports showing compliance with airwo rthiness design 
standards, including stress analysis and flight test reports.  
4.6.3.  Although the requirements for  stress  analysis and flight testing appl ied to the components of the 
modification  itself , there was no requirement under CAR Part 146 for a stress an alysis  or fatigue 
assessment  of the aircraft with the modification installed .  Such an assessment would have helped  
to determine whether the installation of spray equipment on a helicopter , and the subsequent use 
of the helicopter for spraying , affect ed the fatig ue life of the components of a  helicopter  that had 
not been originally certified with a gricultural flying in mind.  
4.6.4.  An aircraft with a modification installed would normally be flight tested  to determine whether there 
is any change in the aircraft's flight  characteristics or performance, but in -flight stress es on aircraft 
components are not normally measured.  F or a full stress analysis of an aircraft with an  installed 
spray modification, the aircraft would have to be fitted with strain gauges42 and flown as  it would 
be in service.   
4.6.5.  Robinson had not designed the R44 for agricultural flying and the refore  the helicopter and its 
components had not been tested or certified with that use  in mind.  Had the inc reased stresses 
and cycles involved with  agricult ural flying been allowed for  during certification, a shorter  service

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report AO-2015-003 life may  have been applied to critical dynamic components  such as the main rotor blades,  if used 
in that  role. 
4.6.6.  Had the ai rcraft design organisation assessed  the loads  and cycles  to which  the modifi ed 
helicopter w ould be  subjected in the agricultural role , and been able to compare these with  the 
original data from the m anufacturer, the increased stresses would likely have been identified .  
However, Robinson submitted  that manufacturer s woul d be reluctant  to release proprietary data 
like th at to other parties , primarily for legal considerations.   In any event, in this case Robinson 
calculated that the increased stresses did not warrant a shortening of  the main rotor blade life.  
4.6.7.  Robin son had n ot been consulted during  the development  of any spray equipment for  the R44, and  
had had no input to the design process or testing and certification stages  of such equipment .  
There was  no requirement for a design organisation to consult the aircraft manuf acturer when 
developing a major modific ation for use in a specialist or unique role for which  the aircraft was not 
originally designed . 
4.6.8.  National aviat ion authorities, like the CAA, that issue type certificates or type acceptance 
certificates appear to be best placed  to obtain the co -operation of a ircraft manufacturer s in 
assess ing the effects of a  proposed modification on continuing airworthiness .  Therefore the 
Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that they consult the original equipmen t 
manufacturer when considering a modification or supplemental type certificate that, if approved, 
could result in an aircraft being used in a way that was significantly different from that which the 
manufacturer originally modelled and used as the basis f or determining component fatigue life and 
the aircraft maintenance programme . 
Finding  
7. The design organisation's  stress analysis  during  the spray system's  design and 
testing  did not take into account , and was not required to take into account, the 
increased  loads and cycles imposed on the dynamic components of a helicopter used 
for agricultural flying.  
  
 
Final Report AO-2015-003 
<< Page 23 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. There were no manufacturing defects in the materials or in the construction of the blade , and the 
examined components of the blade met the design specifications.  
5.2. The point of origin of the crack in the main rotor blade trailing edge had features consistent with 
metal fatigue . 
5.3. The helicopter had been flown mostly on spraying operations at high power settings, which were 
likely to have exceeded  the allowable take-off limit at times.  The high power settings subjected the 
helicopter dynamic components to higher stress than they were designed for . 
5.4. The types of turn used during spraying , particularly  when the helicopter was at heavy weights , likely 
subjec ted the main rotor blades to stresses above those for which the blades were designed and 
contributed to  the onset of fatigue at the chord transition radius . 
5.5. The helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying.  The manufacturer had therefo re 
not been required to consider the increased loads and cycles of agricultural flying when calculating 
the service life of the rotor blades.  
5.6. 'Revision AE' and earlier C016 -7 main rotor blades  had a  small  radius in the trailing edge  chord 
length transition .  This  created a higher stress concentration in this area and reduced the safety 
margin before fatigue cracking  would occur . 
5.7. The design organisation's stress analysis during the spray system's design and testing did not take 
into account, and was not requ ired to take into account, the increased loads and cycles imposed 
on the dynamic components of a helicopter used for agricultural flying .

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to add ress safety issues identified by 
the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
Main rotor blade design  
7.2. In response to this incident , Robinson  issued SB -89 to improve safety margins in earlier version 
C016 -7 blades .  This introduced  a field modification  that reshap ed the trailing edge profile and 
increased the  inboard chord transition  radius .  
7.3. The action s specified in  SB-89 had been mandated in New Zealand by the CAA through the issue of 
AD DCA/R44/32C . The CAA also sent a l etter to all R44 helicopters operators advising them of the 
AD and requesting reports of any in cidents or defects . 
7.4. Robinson  implemented  design changes to  the trailing edge  profile  of 'Revision AG ' C016 -7 blades, 
to improve safety margins by reducing  stress  concentration s and increasing  fatigue tolerance .  In 
addition to the increased inboard radius , the chord transition was  moved  approximately six  inches 
(5.2 centimetres) inboar d, to take advantage of the added strength of the trailing edge doubler.  
Both o f the se changes are  included in  the new  'Revision AG' blades . 
7.5. The FAA  issued  AD 2016 -26-04, which required  inspection s of the chord transition on C016 -7 
blades , and either the removal  from service or an alteration  of the inboard chord transition radius. 
This mandated  the field modification provided by Robinson SB -89 for older revision blades still in 
service  in the United States . 
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.6. None identified

 Final Report AO-2015-003 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give noti ce of , recommendations to any person or organisation that 
it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on whether 
these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport sector.   In thi s 
case, a recommendation  has been issued to the Director of C ivil Aviation.  
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that this recommendation  is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Previous recommendations  
8.3. New Zealand's helicopter accident rate is higher than that of other aviation sectors.  There has 
been public criticism of how helicopters are operated in New Zealand, including a culture of 
operating outside the manufacturers' publ ished and placarded 'never exceed' limitations.  Should 
this situation exist, there is a possibility that such a culture has become normalised.  The core 
safety issue would therefore lie within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on effects to individua l 
operators' safety systems.  
8.4. The Commission is aware that the CAA is currently reviewing the 'sector risk profile' of commercial 
helicopter and small aeroplane operations, and that that work will take a structured approach to 
risk identification and mitiga tion.  
8.5. On 25 October 2017 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation include the 
safety issue of helicopter operational culture in its current 'sector risk profile' review.43   
On 13 November 2017 the Director replied, in part:  
The Part 135 sector risk profile (SRP) published in 2015 identified culture as a risk.  
Over the next two weeks workshops will confirm the 2015 risks and allocate treatment 
owners.  The CAA will monitor the implementation of the treatments, however it must 
be stres sed that it will take some years to convert in the aviation sector.  
8.6. In June 2018 the CAA published a revised sector risk profile for Part 135 Air O perations - 
Helicopter s and Small Aeroplanes.  The revised profile did not address specifically the issue of 
pilots not adhering to  flight ma nual limitations, but its key risk themes included:  
 training and pilot experience  
 organisational environment and culture  
 sector safety culture and collaboration.  
New r ecommendation  
8.7. In New Zealand there is a large agricultura l flyin g industry, with the R44  being the most commonly 
used light helicopter for spraying work.  Over half of the R44 fleet is utilised for agricultural flying 
and s ome of it is also used for carryi ng passengers commercially .   
8.8. The fitting of spray equipm ent to a helicopter for agricultural operations is one example of a 
modification that can result in an aircraft being used in a way that was not contemplated by the 
aircraft manufacturer.  Another example is the conversion of an aeroplane for parachuting 
operations  when that role was not envisaged .  The different uses can result in flight profiles and 
engine handling that could adversely affect the fatigue lives  of aircraft components.  Without 
recognition of and due allowance for such adverse effects, the continuing airworthiness of the 
aircraft might be compromised.  This is a potential safety issue, particularly for m odified aircraft 
that also carry passengers in air  operations .     
Although  modifications may be designed  by approved aircraft design organi sations, it is very 
unlikely that aircraft manufacturer s will release the original fatigue data to independent 
organisations to enable them to assess the effect s of proposed  modification s on the fatigue lives  of 
aircraft and their components .  The reluctan ce to share data is based primarily on legal 
                                                        
43 Commission recommendation 032/17.  
 
Final Report AO-2015-003 
<< Page 27 >>
 considerations.  However, aircraft manufacturers are likely to agree to requests from national 
aviation authorities, such as the CAA, for relevant data.  
8.9. On 14 December  2017  the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil  Aviation that they 
consult  the original equipment manufacturer when considering a modification or supplemental 
type certificate that, if approved, could result in any aircraft being used in a way that is significantly 
different from that whic h the manufacturer originally modelled  and used as the basis for 
determining component fatigue life and the aircraft maintenance programme . (036/17)  
8.10.  On 10 January 2018, the CAA replied:  
In conside ring the draft recommendation, the CAA refers the Commission  to the Director 's 
response on 10 October 2017 where the CAA considers that original equipment 
manufacturers are unlikely to release proprietary and commercially sensitive information 
on the majority of occasions when they are asked to do so.  
However, the Director is prepared to accept the recommendation on the basis that the 
CAA will seek a manufacturer's advice on the utilisation of an aircraft if it is considered 
that a modification or supplemental type certificate may place the aircraft's operations 
outside of those  originally intended.  
8.11.  The CAA Aircraft Certification Unit amended its procedures for the issue of supplemental type 
certificate s and its Major Design Change Authorisation Process Sheet by including a requirement to 
consider whether modificatio ns could result in change s in operational use.  The document 
amendments were completed on 16 March 2018.  The Commission closed recommendation 
036/17 on 23 April 2018.

 Final Report AO-2015-003 9. Key lesson s 
9.1. Metal fatigue occurs continuously in dynamic components .  A fatigue c rack can lengthen  rapidly  
and the component lose its structural strength .  If an unusual or severe vibration develops in  flight, 
the pilot should land immediately and have the helicopter inspected before further flight . 
9.2. The key to minimising stress in dynamic components  is to fly conservatively , especially  when 
operating close to the published  weight, speed and power limits .  The Commission has noted in 
previous inquiry reports that o perating an aircraft  outside the published  limitations significantly 
erodes th e safety margins factored into the service lives  of components  and can quickly lead to an 
early  catastrophic  failure.  
9.3. Operators and maintainers of aircraft that are subjected to cycles or flight profiles that are 
significantly different from those  envisage d by the manufacturer s when the aircraft were 
certificated  should consider implementing shorter  intervals for component inspections  and earlier 
component replacement times.
