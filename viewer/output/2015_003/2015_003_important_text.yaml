  \ failures are rare, but can be  catastrophic.  In this case the fai lure occurred\
  \ at low \nlevel and near a suitable landing site, which enabled the pilot to land\
  \ safely .  \n4.1.2.  Cause s of rotor blade failure have  included  improper maintenance\
  \ or material or manufacturing \ndefects, although overloading an d high stress\
  \ and vibration s have  also led to fatigue cracking .  This \nfailure was a type\
  \ that had not occurred before and the failed blade had logged only 847 hours in\
  \ \nservice, well below the 2,200 -hour service life.  \n4.1.3.  This analysis describes\
  \ the metallurgical tests performed on the failed blade , and examines the \nnature\
  \ of agricultural flying .  The cause of the failure was not determined conclusively,\
  \ but the \nincident underlined the potential for intensive agricultural operations\
  \ to contribut e to component \nfatigue . \n4.1.4.  The fitting of a spray system\
  \  to the R44 was a major modification that change d the usage of the \nhelicopter\
  \ and subjected it to flight stresses that had not been envisaged by the helicopter\
  \  \nmanufacturer.  The analysis discusses this  safety issue .  Aircraft design\
  \ organisation s did not have \nto consider whether proposed  major modification\
  \ s to an aircraft would significantly alter the use of \nthe aircraft or adversely\
  \ affect the service li fe of any component.  \n4.1.5.  The analysis also discusses\
  \ operators and pilots not always knowing and adhering to  the published \nlimitations\
  \ for their aircraft , an issue that  has been raised in a previous Commission report.\
  \  \n4.2. Metallurgical inspections and examinations  \n4.2.1.  Three independent\
  \ metallurgical inspections and examinations were under taken for this inquir y:\
  \ \n\uF0B7 The cracked main rotor blade and its paired blade were inspected at the\
  \ Robinson factory with \nrepresentatives of the NTSB and FAA present.  Both blade\
  \ s were later examined in the NTSB \nmaterials laboratory .  This is discussed\
  \ further in paragraph 4.2.2.  \n\uF0B7 The section of cracked blade and the matching\
  \ portion of its paired blade were examined by a n \nexpert metallurgist at Quest\
  \ Integrity NZL  Limited  (Quest) .26  This is discussed further in \nparagraph\
  \ 4.2. 6. \n\uF0B7 New Zealand Defence Force  experts  used X-ray and other  non-destructive\
  \ inspection methods \nto look for evidence of fatigue on a set of time -expired\
  \ main rotor blades taken from another \nR44 that had been used almost exclusively\
  \ on agricultural operations.  Within the limits of the \ninspection techniques\
  \ employed , no defects were identified . \nNTSB examination  \n4.2.2.  The NTSB\
  \ laboratory examination  report  is included in Appendix 1.  The examination determined\
  \ \nthat the crack s contained  features consistent with  fatigue  failure , and\
  \ that their  origin was  likely to \nhave been at the trailing edge  where  the\
  \ upper and lower skins were bonded  (see Figure 8 ).  The \nportion of the fracture\
  \ surface consistent with fatigue cracking was 3.65 \u2033 (9.3 centimetres ) in\
  \ \nlength and exhibited features typical of progressive crack growth.  The remai\
  \ nder of the fracture \nexhibited mixed -mode27 cracking , then  a pure over stress\
  \  failure  (see F igure 9). \n                                                \
  \        \n26 The Quest examination was undertaken three years after that by the\
  \ NTSB.  \n27 A combination of overstress and fatigue cracking.  \n \n\n<< Page\

  \  Materials Laboratory Factual report 15 -049 \n4.2.3.  The NTSB examination report\
  \ concluded that there were no manufacturing defects in the materials \nor in the\
  \ construction of the blade, with all components of the blade meeting the design\
  \ \nspecifications.  The materials experts from  the NTSB also  stated that the\
  \ crack may have started in \nthe epoxy sealant that coated the trailing edge, and\
  \ that it could have spread into the aluminium \nskin from there.  The epoxy sealant\
  \ was not intended to be a structural or load -bearing component \nof the blade\
  \ and was designed to flex with it.  However, if the blade flex ed significantly\
  \ in service \nunder cyclic loa ds, it is possible that the epoxy cracked first,\
  \ creating a further stress concentration \nat that location.  \n4.2.4.  The NTSB\
  \ al so visually inspected the paired  blade in the vicinity of the chord transition\
  \  and found \n\"no indication of cracks, dents, or other damage.   No anomalies\
  \ were seen  in the underlying \nsealant or alumin ium skins \". \n \n\n \nFinal\

  \ Factual report 15 -049 \nIndependent New Zealand examination  \n4.2.5.  The Quest\
  \ examination report is included in Appendix 2.   The fracture section (which had\
  \ been \nprepared  for the earlier NTSB examination) was examined with a scanning\
  \ electron microscope.  \nThe report commented:  \nThe location of the origin, at\
  \ the inner corner at the trailing edge of the aluminium \nlayers does strongly\
  \ suggest that part of the loading is due t o bending or flexing \naround the minor\
  \ axis of the blade section.  It is understood that the nominal loading \nat this\
  \ point is a combination of centrifugal loading from rotation, and bending/flexing\
  \ \naround the major axis of the blade cross section due to aer odynamic loading.\
  \  The \nadditional bending load required to initiate a crack at the apparent location\
  \ may be \ndue to a particular vibrational mode in the blade, excited by other loads\
  \ applied to the \nblade.  \nThe absence of any visible defects at the crack orig\
  \ ins strongly suggests that the \nfatigue crack was caused by an applied load in\
  \ excess of the capacity of the blade to \nmeet the designed/designated fatigue\
  \ life.  The applied load would be a combination \nof varying centrifugal, aerodynamic\
  \ and possibly vibrat ional stresses, resulting in the \ninitiation and propagation\
  \ of a fatigue crack at a critical location on the blade trailing \nedge (the stress\
  \ concentration formed by the trailing edge transition).  \n4.2.6.  Quest  also\
  \ inspected the paired  blade from the helicopter f or any sign of cracking or overstress\
  \ in \nthe area of the chord transition.  As sectioning of the area was not feasible,\
  \ Quest could only \nremove all coatings from the chord transition area and remove\
  \ shallow surface defects  before \nmaking a visual examination .  Quest reported\
  \ that \"no defects or discontinuities were seen in the \naluminium layers at the\
  \ transition radius where the crack in the other blade had initiated. \"  Quest\
  \ \nfurther commented:  \nAlthough both blades would have seen similar aerodynamic\
  \ and mecha nical loads in \nservice, the absence of a fatigue crack in one blade\
  \ does suggest a quantifiable \ndifference between the two blades.  This may be\
  \ [due to] one or more of the following:  \n\uF0B7 marginally stronger material,\
  \ adhesive or fabrication resulted in a grea ter \nmargin against fatigue crack\
  \ initiation  \n\n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO-2015-003 \uF0B7 slight variations\
  \ in fabrication and/or installation in the blade assembly \nresulted in a marginally\
  \ different vibration response from the same loading, \ncompared to the fractured\
  \ blade, resulting in a slightly low er cyclic load, and \nhence no crack initiation\
  \ or propagation at the time of removal from service . \nFinding s  \n1. There were\
  \ no manufacturing defects in the materials or in the construction of the \nblade\
  \ , and the examined components of the blade met the design sp ecifications.  \n\
  2. The point of origin of the crack  in the main rotor blade trailing edge had features\
  \ \nconsistent with metal fatigue.  \n \n4.3. Operational factors  considered  \n\
  Overloading  \n4.3.1.  Rotor b lade failures that are caused by  flying overweight\
  \ , or excessive main rotor  revolutions per \nminute (RPM) ,28 typically involve\
  \ crack s located closer to the blade root29 where bending and \ncentrifugal  forces\
  \ are at their highest.  However,  this failure occurred at a different location,\
  \ closer \nto the t ip of the blade  where  the chord le ngth transition s and twisting\
  \ forces are greater .   \n4.3.2.  A comparison of the operational  statistical\
  \ returns30 for the operator with those of other operators \nthat used R44s for\
  \ spraying  did not indicate that the maximum all -up weight  had been exceed ed\
  \ in \nservice .  The a verage  load for the incident helicopter while on agricultural\
  \ operations was \nconsistent  with the industry  average in  New Zealand . \nPower\
  \ settings  \n4.3.3.  The chief pilot stated that their pilots used the maximum\
  \ allowable power for take -off.  The \nmaximum al lowable take -off power was determined\
  \ by adding a fixed increment of 2.8\u2033 Hg to the \nmaximum continuous power\
  \ permitted for the existing conditions of pressure altitude and outside \nair temperature.\
  \  The pilot's operating handbook contained a table, which was also displayed in\
  \ the \ncockpit , that showed the maximum continuous powe r for different conditions\
  \ (see Figure 10).  \n  \n                                                     \
  \   \n28 A high rotor RPM  increase s the centri fugal force on the blade, which\
  \ is also a function of the weight of the blade, so the \nstress will  be higher\
  \ towards the blade root where it is attached to the hub . \n29 Where the main rotor\
  \ blade is attached to the main rotor head at the top of the mast . \n30 Agricultural\
  \ operators are required to submit three -monthly returns to the CAA that contain\
  \ the number of hours flown, the \nnumber of loads carried, the amount of product\
  \ applied in tonnes or litres and the area covered in hectares.  \n \nFinal Report\
  \ AO-2015-003 \n<< Page 17 >>\n  \nFigure 9 \nEngine power limits  \nSource: Robinson\
  \ Helicopter Company  \n4.3.4.  The absolute maximum ('red line') power of 26.1\
  \ \u2033 Hg applied only when the outside air \ntemperature was 40  degrees Celsi\
  \ us (\xB0C) (at sea level (from Figure 10: 23.3 \u2033 Hg plus 2.8 \u2033 Hg).\
  \  The \noperator was based in the lower South Island where temperatures were relatively\
  \ low, and would \nalmost certainly never have flown  under those conditions.  They\
  \ would have been  more likely t o fly \nin temperatures between 0\xB0C and 20\xB0\
  C at altitudes between sea level and 2 ,000 feet .  Under \nthose conditions, the\
  \ maximum take -off power would have been  between 24.6 \u2033 Hg and 25.7 \u2033\
  \ Hg.  \nAt interview, neither pilot could state the red line value.  The p ilots'\
  \ statements about using \nmaximum allowable power without having a correct awareness\
  \ of the red line value or allowing for \nthe ambient conditions suggested that\
  \ they would likely have inadvertently exceeded at times the \npilot's operating\
  \ handbook  limit for maximum take -off power.  \n4.3.5.  The chief pilot said they\
  \ operated the aircraft up to the limit, but not all the time, and not over the\
  \ \nlimit.  The chief pilot said during the first interview that the power required\
  \ during take -off was 23 -\n24\u2033 Hg, and up to 26 \u2033 Hg on occasions. \
  \ The power was then reduced to about 20 \u2033 Hg for the spray \nruns.  The maximum\
  \ continuous power setting was 23.3 \u2033 Hg.  Therefore it is very likely that\
  \ the \nengine was inadvertently run at high power settings at times while the helicopter\
  \ was spraying . \n4.3.6.  Although Robinson  had set limits on the engine manifold\
  \ pressure  and the engine had been \n'derated'31 from its maximum  power output,\
  \ it was possible for pilots to demand more engine \npower than the helicopter's\
  \  dynamic componen ts were designed to absorb.   It was therefore \npossible  to\
  \ over stress the helicopter by  exceeding the power limit for the ambient conditions\
  \ . \n4.3.7.  The integrity of component s will be compromised if they are subjected\
  \ to excessive  stress.  A single \ninstance of ov er-stress may be sufficient to\
  \ cause damage .  The accumul ation of fatigue can be \nrapid and  reach  the point\
  \ of failure before early detection is possible .  Robinson Safety Notice SN-\n\
  37 (see Appendix 5), which is included in the pilot's operating handbook of every\
  \ Robinson \nhelicopter,  highlighted  the detrimental effects of  excessive  loading\
  \  and engine  power settings  on \nthe service life of dynamic  components . \n\
  Turns \n4.3.8.  The in-flight strain survey  carried out by R obinson  included\
  \  manoeuvres commonly used  during \nagricultural flying .  Turns typically used\
  \ between s pray runs , with cyclic and collective pull -ups of \nlow to moderate\
  \ severity , were performed during the flight testing .  A direct c omparison with\
  \ some \nof the turn techniques used by the operator could not be a chieved , because\
  \ Robinson  did not \nexactly replicate the same turn technique  during its testing\
  \  and the test aircraft did not have spray \nequipment fitted .  From the in-flight\
  \ strain survey , Robinson  found that:  \n                                    \
  \                    \n31 The Lycoming IO -540 was originally used in fixed -wing\
  \ aircraft and produced 300 horsepower at t ake-off, whereas in the \nR44 the power\
  \  was limited to about 245 horsepower.  \n\n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO-2015-003\
  \ The stresses were just below the level where t hey would contribute to fatigue\
  \ damage. It \nis likely therefore that if the helicopter exceeded the maximum gross\
  \ weight and/or the \nturns were performed more aggressively the loads would be\
  \ damaging.  \n4.3.9.  According to industry feedback, some of the turn techniq\
  \ ues used by the operator were  not widely \nused  during spraying operations ,\
  \ and were not taught during basic agricultural flight training .  A \ncharacteristic\
  \ of these types of turn is that the helicopter reverses the direction in which\
  \ it is \nheading  while it has zero airspeed.  If the turn is initiated earlier\
  \ while the helicopter is still \nclimbing , the heading of the helicopter  during\
  \ the latter part of the climb  is not aligned with  the \nflight path .  \n4.3.10.\
  \  During th is type of  turn the helicopter  change s from flying  forwards to\
  \ flying sideways , and possibly \nto flying  backwards  if the turn is initiated\
  \ early enough.  The helicopter must then translat e to flying \nforward  again\
  \ .  Consequently  the turn can take place  for the most part in 'transitional flight\
  \ '.32  \nAccording to a technical report that studied  helicopter loads, fatigue\
  \ and design, published by the \nAustralian Department of Defence 's Defence  Science\
  \ and Technology Organisation 's Aeronautical \nResearch Laboratory in 1993 : \n\
  'Transitional flight ' generates the highest  vibratory stresses. When comparing\
  \ to a 'transport mission', \n'crop spraying' gives approximately the same rotor\
  \ blade fatigue life, unless prolonged 'transitional \nflight ' is included in the\
  \ spectrum, in which case the fatigue life becomes less than half t he life of the\
  \ \ntransport mission.  The main rotor blades respond to transient loading by flapping,\
  \ leading , lagging and \ntwisting.  \n4.3.11.  For a considerable period during\
  \ such a  turn there is reduced  translational lift33 as the helicopter \nairspeed\
  \ reduce s and the direction of the flight path is reversed .  This type of turn\
  \ differs from a \nconventional ' teardrop  turn'  where airspeed and therefore\
  \ translational lift are conserved .  \n4.3.12.  In re gard to  the consequence\
  \ s of this  type of manoeuvring , Robinson  stated : \nSince the re lationship\
  \ between loads and fatigue is exponential it is  possible that \noperation consistently\
  \ over maximum gross weight or excessively aggressive turns could \ncause an order\
  \ of magnitude reduction34 in fatigue life .   \n4.3.13.  Robinson  advised that\
  \ the dominant vari able in main rotor blade fatigue damage is blade angle of \n\
  attack, which results in large variations in chord -wise bending loads.   At the\
  \ maximum all -up \nweight,  pulling out of an aggressive  turn requires  significant\
  \ increases  in blade pitch angle s (angles \nof attack)  and engine power , along\
  \ with an increase in  gravity loading .  The effect of increased \naerodynamic\
  \ forces  and the loading  of the blade s during  aggressive  agricultural manoeuvres\
  \ is the \nlikely mechanism for  the metal fatigue acc umulation  result ing in\
  \ a significant fatigue  penalty.  \nExceeding aircraft limits  \n4.3.14.  The operator's\
  \ pilots had inadvertently used engine power settings that were likely , at times\
  \ , to \nhave been above the maximum allowable for the ambient conditions . \n4.3.15.\
  \  The Commission noted in a previo us inquiry report35 that New Zealand's helicopter\
  \ accident rate \nwas higher than that of other aviation sectors, and that there\
  \ had been public criticism of how \nhelicopters were  operated in New Zealand,\
  \ including a culture of operating outside the \nmanufactur ers' published and placarded\
  \ 'never exceed' limitations.  It noted that t here was a \npossibility that such\
  \ a culture had become normalised.  The core safety issue would therefore lie \n\
  within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on effects to individual ope rators'\
  \ safety systems.  \n4.3.16.  In the previous inquiry report, t he Commission  did\
  \ not make a recommendation because it  was \naware that the CAA was reviewing the\
  \ 'sector risk profile' of commercial helicopter and small \n                  \

  \ already recommen ded that the Director of Civil Aviation include the \nsafety\
  \ issue of helicopter operational culture in that review.  \nFinding s \n3. The\
  \ helicopter had been flown mostly on spraying operations at high power settings,\
  \ \nwhich were likely to have exceeded  the allowable  limit at times.  The high\
  \ power \nsettings subjected the helicopter dynamic components to higher stress\
  \ than they \nwere designed for.  \n4. The types of turn used during  spraying ,\
  \ particularly  when  the helicopter was at heavy \nweight s, likely subjected the\
  \ main rot or blade s to stres ses above those for which the \nblades were designed\
  \  and contributed to  the onset of  fatigue a t the chord transition \nradius.\
  \  \n \n4.4. Fatigue and cycle calculations during certification  \n4.4.1.  Aircraft\
  \ components are subject to a wide variety of mechanic al and environmental stresses,\
  \ and \nare particularly susceptible to accumulated fatigue.  The continued safe\
  \ operation of aircraft \nrequires manufacturers to determine the expected lives\
  \  of critical component s.  With that \nknowledge , appropriate inspection an d\
  \ replacement schedules can be implemented  to ensure that \ncomponents are replaced\
  \ well before they are likely to fail in service.  \n4.4.2.  Robinson  specified\
  \  that one engine and rotor 'stop-start '36 was equivalent to one ' fatigue cycle'\
  \  on \nthe blade .  This definitio n was used  in its calculations to  forecast\
  \ component reliability, determine \nfatigue  life and publish  service  life limits\
  \ .  Robinson  advised  that during  the assessment of fatigue \nduring main rotor\
  \ blade design and certification , a rate of  six stop-start cycles per flight hour\
  \  was \nassumed.   That cycle rate was combined with t he in-flight fatigue spectrum37\
  \ and the stress -cycle \ncurve38 for the blade  to produce t he blade's fatigue\
  \ life39 of 4, 000 hours  (24,000 cycles) .  After \napplying a  safety margin ,\
  \ 2,200 hours (13,200 cycles) was specified for the main rotor blade \nservice \
  \ life.40  \n4.4.3.  Figures provided by the operator  showed that  the helicopter\
  \ flew an average of 1 2.5 product  loads \nper hour  during spraying,  and about\
  \  15 turns between spray runs were conducted during t he \napplication  of each\
  \ load .  Robinson submitted that the fatigue damage depended on the \nmagnitude\
  \ of the stress cycle , and that the damage associated with a n aggressive turn\
  \ was \nsignificantly less than  that associated with  a ground -air-ground cycle\
  \ .  Howe ver, stress cycles are \naccumulated more quickly during agricultural\
  \ flying than they are during a 'standard' flight profile.  \n4.4.4.  The type of\
  \ flight operation performed affects the fatigue lives  of helicopter components\
  \ .  A Civil \nAviation Safety Authority  of Au stralia bulletin41 (see Appendix\
  \ 6) describe d how component  fatigue \nlife may be affected by : \n\uF0B7 operation\
  \ of helicopters  in agricultural operations where high loads may be \nencountered\
  \ more frequently than envisaged by the manufacturer  \n\uF0B7 operations where\
  \ there ar e a high number of landings and take -offs per hour  \n\uF0B7 frequent\
  \ operations at or near maximum all up weight.  \n                             \
  \                           \n36 One cycle  is taken from the rotors start ing to\
  \ rotat e until they  stop rotati ng after engine shut -down.  \n37 The fatigue\
  \ spectrum is developed from in -flight stresses recorded during a 'standard'  flight\
  \ profile, which  involves the \nnormal manoeuvres expected in  air transport, private\
  \ an d training flights, but not in agricultural fl ying.  \n38 The s tress life\
  \ of a component  is derived from testing the component with a specific load for\
  \ a number of cycles until it fails. \nTests are carried out at increasing loads\
  \ that result in fewer  cycles until failure. The results are plotted on a chart\
  \ to produce an \n'S-N' curve .  This determines the fatigue limit , the point (\
  \ applied  load) at which any number  (or for certain materials a very high \nnumber,\
  \ typically 107) of cycles will not result in component failure.  \n39 The minimum\
  \ numb er of stop -start cycles and flight hours that stress  (fatigue spectrum\
  \ loads ) can be applied to a \ncomp onent before a failure could  occur.  \n40\
  \ Finite or safe life is a usage limit specified for a component, in hours or calendar\
  \ time, after which time it must be discar ded. \nIt is significantly lower than\
  \ the fatigue life to ensure that the component will not fa il in service . \n41\
  \ airworthiness bulletin (AWB 02 -015)  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report AO-2015-003\
  \ 4.4.5.  The bulletin  also stated that fatigue damage is accelerated when the\
  \ cyclic loads on a component \nare of greater magnitude and frequency than envisaged\
  \ during the design of the component.   The \nstandard flight profiles used by Robinson\
  \  to de termine  the fatigue s pectrum for the R44  blades did \nnot include the\
  \ types of manoeuvre  or number of cycles associated with agricultural flying. \
  \ \nTherefore Robinson 's fatigue -life calculations and safe -life limits  for\
  \ components used in standard \nflight operations  were unlikely to be valid for\
  \ helicopters routinely used for  agricultural operations.  \n4.4.6.  After the\
  \ incident Robinson  recalculated the fatigue life of R44 main rotor  blade s used\
  \ in \nagricultural operations, using  an increased stop-start cycle rate of 10\
  \  per hour .  The  fatigue life \nreduced from 4 ,000 hours  to 3,400 ho urs. \
  \ However, Robinson  determined  that the safe life of \n2,200 hours would not need\
  \ to be reduced becaus e an adequate safety margin still remain ed. \n4.4.7.  In\
  \ contrast, t he engine manufacturer  had previously recognised that agricultural\
  \ flying results in \ngreater stresses in components, and had reduced the time between\
  \ overhaul  for engines used in \naircraft performing  that role.  The standard\
  \  engine fit ted to an R44 normally has an overhaul period  \nof 2,000 hours .\
  \  However , if the helicopter is used for agricultural flying this is reduced to\
  \ 1 ,500 \nhours.  T his limitation was introduced  by the engine manufacturer \
  \ because  of the increased \nstresses  during high  power setti ngs at heavier\
  \  weights, and the associat ed reduction in the \nexpected service lives  of the\
  \ engine 's components.  \n4.4.8.  The Quest examination of the fractured blade\
  \ found evidence of high cycle fatigue.  Small \ndifferences in material properties\
  \ result in a variation in fatigue life between samples/objects that \nexperience\
  \ the same loading conditions.  That is l ikely the reason for one blade failing\
  \ before there \nwas any indication of fatigue damage in the other blade.  \nFinding\
  \  \n5. The helicopter was not designed specifically for agricultural flying.  The\
  \ manufacturer \nhad therefore not been required to consider the increased loads\
  \ and cycles of \nagricultural flying when calculating the service  life of the\
  \ rotor blades.  \n \n4.5. Desig n factors  \n4.5.1.  During the course of the inquiry,\
  \ it was suggested  to the Commission that the main rotor blade \ncrack was the\
  \ result of a failure in main rotor blade design.  It was submitted that the presence\
  \ of a \ndesign flaw was supported  by Robinson subsequent ly modifying  the main\
  \ rotor blade to reduce the \nstress concentration around the chord transition,\
  \ where this failure occurred.  \n4.5.2.  This incident is the only recorded  case\
  \  of fatigue cracking in  the chord length transition  radius of a \nC016 -7 main\
  \ rotor blade .  The fracture of the blade at the chord transition indicated that\
  \ in -service \nstresses at the chord transition were higher than Robinson had anticipated.\
  \  The critical stress \nlocation on the main rotor blade had shifted from being\
  \ near the blade root, where it had been on \nearlier versions of the blade.  However,\
  \ Robinson advised that u nder design operating conditions \nthe shift would not\
  \ have been an issue, because even allowing for the additional stress of intensive\
  \ \nagricultural operations, Robinson had calcu lated that there was still an adequate\
  \ margin above the \n2,200 hours ' stated service life.  \n4.5.3.  The 'Revision\
  \ AG' blade incorporated  a move of the chord length transition inboard of the stainless\
  \ \nsteel doubler termination.  Robinson advised that this change was  to provide\
  \ a strength margin in \ncase of corrosion or damage at or near the transition radius\
  \ (see Figure 6).  \n4.5.4.  The design change  Robinson made as a result has improve\
  \ d the blade's safety margin for fatigue \nresistance .  FAA AD  2016 -26-04 and\
  \ CAA AD DCA/R44/ 32C have  mandate d the field service \nmodification specified\
  \ in Safety Bulletin SB -89, which is  an interim measure until the blades are \n\
  replaced.  Although t he full benefits of the design improvements can only be achieved\
  \ by \nreplacement with 'Revision AG' bl ades, Robinson advised that SB -89 restores\
  \ the calculated \nfatigue life for early revision blades to that of the new 'Revision\
  \ AG' blade . \n4.5.5.  Therefore, the Commission does not consider that the fatigue\
  \ cracking was the result of a design \n'flaw'.  If it had be en, there would have\
  \ been more reco rded cases of fatigue cracking in the many \n \nFinal Report AO-2015-003\
  \ \n<< Page 21 >>\n other blades in service, many of which had significantly more\
  \ accumulated hours in service than \nthose fitted to the incident helicopter .\
  \ \n4.5.6.  It is considered  that the higher -than -normal stresses imparted on\
  \ the blades during agricultural \noperations are likely to have  culminated in\
  \ a fatigue crack developing in the area  of the blade  most \nsusceptible to those\
  \ type s of stressor.   The modification of the blade design by Robinson was to\
  \ \nincrease the design margin in case trailing -edge damage occurred to the blade\
  \ , or the particular \nhelicopter operations exceed ed the number of cycle s and\
  \ the nature of stresses envisaged when \ndesigning the life cycle s of components.\
  \  \nFinding  \n6. 'Revision AE' and earlier C016 -7 main rotor blades  had a small\
  \  radius in the \ntrailing edge chord length transition .  This  created a higher\
  \ stress concentration in \nthis area and reduced the safety margin before fatigue\
  \ cracking  would occur . \n4.6. Major aircraft  modifications  and role changes\
  \  \nSafety issue: Aircraft design organisations d id not have to consider whether\
  \ proposed major \nmodifications to an aircraft w ould significantly alter the use\
  \ of the aircraft or adversely affect the \nservice life of any component . \n4.6.1.\
  \  The install ation of spray e quipment on the helicopter  was a major modification\
  \  that had been  \napproved by a  design organisation certificated under  CAR Part\
  \ 146  Aircraft Design Organisations - \nCertification .  An aircraft design organisation\
  \ holds a delegation  from the CAA to approve design \nchanges and aircraft modifications.\
  \  CAR Part 21  Certification of Products and Parts  requires all \ndesigns and\
  \ design changes to be approved by the Director of Ci vil Aviation, but the Civil\
  \ Aviation \nAct 1990 allows this to  be delega ted to other acceptable persons\
  \ .  CAR Part 146 provides details \nof the requirements for acceptable persons\
  \  and the certification and operati ng procedures for \ndesign organisations. \
  \ \n4.6.2.  Under CAR Part 146, an aircraft  design organisation  shall  ensure\
  \  that its designs a nd design \nchanges have no \"unsafe features \", and shall\
  \  establish procedures to:  \n\uF0B7 test and inspect specimens to [of] the type\
  \ design to show compliance with airworthiness \ndesign standards: and  \n\uF0B7\
  \ produce, check, and control reports showing compliance with airwo rthiness design\
  \ \nstandards, including stress analysis and flight test reports.  \n4.6.3.  Although\
  \ the requirements for  stress  analysis and flight testing appl ied to the components\
  \ of the \nmodification  itself , there was no requirement under CAR Part 146 for\
  \ a stress an alysis  or fatigue \nassessment  of the aircraft with the modification\
  \ installed .  Such an assessment would have helped  \nto determine whether the\
  \ installation of spray equipment on a helicopter , and the subsequent use \nof\
  \ the helicopter for spraying , affect ed the fatig ue life of the components of\
  \ a  helicopter  that had \nnot been originally certified with a gricultural flying\
  \ in mind.  \n4.6.4.  An aircraft with a modification installed would normally be\
  \ flight tested  to determine whether there \nis any change in the aircraft's flight\
  \  characteristics or performance, but in -flight stress es on aircraft \ncomponents\
  \ are not normally measured.  F or a full stress analysis of an aircraft with an\
  \  installed \nspray modification, the aircraft would have to be fitted with strain\
  \ gauges42 and flown as  it would \nbe in service.   \n4.6.5.  Robinson had not\
  \ designed the R44 for agricultural flying and the refore  the helicopter and its\
  \ \ncomponents had not been tested or certified with that use  in mind.  Had the\
  \ inc reased stresses \nand cycles involved with  agricult ural flying been allowed\
  \ for  during certification, a shorter  service \n                             \
  \                           \n42 A device used to measure the strain (or stress)\
  \ on an object. It consists of a conductive metallic strip that changes its \nelectrical\
  \ resistance when stretched.  \n \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report AO-2015-003 life\
  \ may  have been applied to critical dynamic components  such as the main rotor\
  \ blades,  if used \nin that  role. \n4.6.6.  Had the ai rcraft design organisation\
  \ assessed  the loads  and cycles  to which  the modifi ed \nhelicopter w ould be\
  \  subjected in the agricultural role , and been able to compare these with  the\
  \ \noriginal data from the m anufacturer, the increased stresses would likely have\
  \ been identified .  \nHowever, Robinson submitted  that manufacturer s woul d be\
  \ reluctant  to release proprietary data \nlike th at to other parties , primarily\
  \ for legal considerations.   In any event, in this case Robinson \ncalculated that\
  \ the increased stresses did not warrant a shortening of  the main rotor blade life.\
  \  \n4.6.7.  Robin son had n ot been consulted during  the development  of any spray\
  \ equipment for  the R44, and  \nhad had no input to the design process or testing\
  \ and certification stages  of such equipment .  \nThere was  no requirement for\
  \ a design organisation to consult the aircraft manuf acturer when \ndeveloping\
  \ a major modific ation for use in a specialist or unique role for which  the aircraft\
  \ was not \noriginally designed . \n4.6.8.  National aviat ion authorities, like\
  \ the CAA, that issue type certificates or type acceptance \ncertificates appear\
  \ to be best placed  to obtain the co -operation of a ircraft manufacturer s in\
  \ \nassess ing the effects of a  proposed modification on continuing airworthiness\
  \ .  Therefore the \nCommission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that\
  \ they consult the original equipmen t \nmanufacturer when considering a modification\
  \ or supplemental type certificate that, if approved, \ncould result in an aircraft\
  \ being used in a way that was significantly different from that which the \nmanufacturer\
  \ originally modelled and used as the basis f or determining component fatigue life\
  \ and \nthe aircraft maintenance programme . \nFinding  \n7. The design organisation's\
  \  stress analysis  during  the spray system's  design and \ntesting  did not take\
  \ into account , and was not required to take into account, the \nincreased  loads\
  \ and cycles imposed on the dynamic components of a helicopter used \nfor agricultural\
  \ flying.  \n  \n \nFinal Report AO-2015-003 \n<< Page 23 >>"
