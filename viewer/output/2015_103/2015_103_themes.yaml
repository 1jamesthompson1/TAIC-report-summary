- name: Role Overload and Conflicting Responsibilities
  explanation: The safety theme of role overload and conflicting responsibilities is highlighted by the fact that the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader to also take on the safety-critical role of rail protection officer. This dual role placed an excessive burden on one individual, which is not conducive to maintaining high safety standards. The report states that "the responsibility for overseeing the sleeper replacement project and ensuring the safety of the workers should never have been placed on one person" (4.2.1). The rail protection officer was under considerable pressure due to his responsibilities as team leader, which contributed to the incident (4.2.2). KiwiRail later introduced a plan to separate the roles of rail protection officer and work supervisor (team leader) to reduce the risks of track occupation incidents (4.2.9).
- name: Non-Technical Skills Deficiency
  explanation: Non-technical skills, such as teamwork, communication, and situational awareness, were identified as a safety issue because none of the workers, including the production manager, had been trained in or had any knowledge of KiwiRail's non-technical skills practices (4.3). The lack of non-technical skills training among the workers could have prevented the incident, as these skills help mitigate and manage errors (4.3.3). The report suggests that if the workers had been trained in non-technical skills, they might have questioned the rail protection officer about the whereabouts of the passenger train, which could have prevented the incident (4.3.7, 4.3.8).
- name: Inadequate Scaffolding and Project Delays
  explanation: The safety theme of inadequate scaffolding and project delays is relevant because the sleeper replacement project was behind schedule, which was partly due to insufficient equipment provided for scaffolding the entire length of the bridge (4.2.3). The need to move scaffolding along small sections of the bridge each day added about two hours of work, adversely affecting the project timeline and contributing to the pressure felt by the rail protection officer (4.2.3).
- name: Organisational and Management Pressure
  explanation: Organisational and management pressure is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. The rail protection officer was being closely monitored by the production manager and the area engineering manager due to previous performance issues (4.2.4). The presence of the managers on-site increased the pressure on the rail protection officer, who was already overwhelmed with managing all aspects of the project (4.2.5). This pressure likely contributed to the lapse in memory and distraction that led to the error (4.2.6).
- name: Substance Use and Impairment
  explanation: Substance use and impairment is a critical safety theme as the rail protection officer tested positive for methamphetamine during a post-incident drug and alcohol test (4.4). Although it was unlikely that the rail protection officer was impaired at the time of the incident, the fact that he had not been tested for 10 years indicates that KiwiRail's random testing policy may not have been a sufficient deterrent (4.4.9). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail increase the percentage of random testing to enhance the deterrent effect (4.4.10).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  explanation: Communication breakdown is a safety theme that emerges from the incident, as the rail protection officer was communicating with the train controller and recording event times in his log book within his vehicle, which was not equipped with external speakers. This setup excluded the workers from hearing the radio transmissions and being aware of the authorisation details for train movements through the worksite (4.3.6). Better communication, possibly facilitated by non-technical skills training, could have prevented the incident by ensuring all workers were informed of the situation (4.3.8).
