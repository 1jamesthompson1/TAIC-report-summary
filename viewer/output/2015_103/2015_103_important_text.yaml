  \ who are maintaining rail tracks is a safety -critical process that carries a \n\
  high level of responsibility.  Any lack of adherence to the process for facilitating\
  \ such \nprotection can have severe consequences.  In this instance there would\
  \ have been  nowhere \nfor the w orkers to escape to had the train crossed the bridge.\
  \  \n4.1.2.  In human factor terms the type of error the rail protection officer\
  \ made in locking on to the \nframe when he had just authorised the passenger train\
  \ to pass through the worksite  is \nconsidered a 'lapse4'.  It was not an intentional\
  \ act and it was not a knowledge -based error.  \nThe rail protection off icer knew\
  \ what the correct procedure was and had successfully \nundertaken  it for the passage\
  \ of four other trains that day. \n4.1.3.  However, such an error need not resul\
  \ t in an accident or incident.  There were opportunities \nfor the other workers\
  \  involved to intervene and prevent it happening.  \n4.1.4.  The Australian Transport\
  \ Safety Bureau identified in a report  (Safety Issues Investigation - Safe \nwork\
  \ on t rack)  that the majority of incidents in Australia could  be attributable\
  \ to individual \nactions rather than environmental or organisational influences.\
  \  In this case  the individual \nactions of the rail protection officer were a\
  \ factor.  However, there were also organisational \nfactors that influenced the\
  \ actions of those involved.  \n4.1.5.  The reasons for such a lapse are discussed\
  \ below.  Also discussed are three safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 the first safety issue\
  \ was that the KiwiRail system al lowed the team leader, with all of \nthe tasks\
  \ and responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety -critical\
  \ \nrole of rail protection officer  \n\uF0B7 the second safety issue was the poor\
  \ standard of non -technical skills among  all the \nworkers who were  on site \n\
  \uF0B7 the third safety issue was the rail protection officer's positive  post-incident\
  \  test result \nfor methamphetamine.  \n4.1.6.  The rail protection officer and\
  \ the maintenance  worker s should not have locked their  padlock s \nto the frame\
  \  and been allowed to proceed on to the track until the passenger train had \n\
  passed.   The situation could have been prevented if the workers had questi oned\
  \ the rail \nprotection officer as to the whereabouts of the passenger train.  \
  \ A more serious incident might \nhave occurred but for the slow speed request made\
  \ to the train driver by the rail protection \nofficer.  \n4.2. Rail protection\
  \ officer or team leader  \nSafety issue - the KiwiRail system allowed the team\
  \ leader, with all of the tasks and  \nresponsibilities associated with that role,\
  \ to take on the safety -critical role of rail protection \nofficer . \n4.2.1. \
  \ The responsibilit y for overseeing the sleeper replacement project and ensuring\
  \ the safety of \nthe work ers should never have been placed on one perso n.  In\
  \ this case the team leader did \nhave other members of the work g roup who were\
  \ qualified to take on the rail protection officer \nrole.  However, because of\
  \ personal and professional issues within the team, he felt more \ncomfortable taking\
  \ on the role him self. \n                                                     \
  \   \n4Reason J.  Human error.  New York: Cambridge University Press; 1990  describes\
  \ these as missed actions or \nomissions - when someone fails to do something due\
  \ to lapses in memory and/or distraction.  \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2015\
  \ -103 4.2.2.  The rail protection officer was under considerable pressure at the\
  \ time of the incident, mainly  \nrelated to his responsibilities as team leader.\
  \  The project was significantly behind time, \nalthough this was mainly related\
  \ to KiwiRail's resourcing of t he project.  \n4.2.3.  A princip al reason for the\
  \ project running late was the scaffolding arrangements  put in place \nto provide\
  \ the maintenance workers with a safe platform  from which to work.  Insufficient\
  \ \nequipment had been provided to scaffold the whole length of the bridge  for\
  \ the duration of the \nproject .  As sleeper replacement work progressed , scaffolding\
  \ was removed and re -secured \nalong small sections o f the bridge .  It was a\
  \  task that took about two hours each day  and that \nhad an adverse effect on\
  \ the project timeline.  \n4.2.4.  Additionally the production manager , who was\
  \ on site at the time of the incident , and the area \nengineering manager had been\
  \ closely  monitoring the rail protection officer 's performance  \nafter a number\
  \ of previous alleged performance issues relating to the late running of projects\
  \ \nfor which he was responsible .  The rail protection officer said that the manager's\
  \ presence  had \nincreased the pressure he was already feeling  on the day . \n\
  4.2.5.  At the time of the incident , the eight -day project  was only 5 0% complete\
  \ after 15 days.  The \nrail protection officer was unable to see a way to catch\
  \ up despite working in his own time.  He \nsaid he had become overwhelmed with\
  \ the responsibility of managing all aspects of the \nproject . \n4.2.6.  The rail\
  \ protection officer' s error in allowing the wor kers to on -track ahead of the\
  \ passenger \ntrain is symptomatic of what James Reason describes as 'lapses in\
  \ memory and/or \ndistraction'.  The rail protection officer was clearly distracted\
  \ by stressors associated with his \nother role s.  This incident is a good example\
  \ of why staff assigned to the safety -critical role of \nrail protection officer\
  \ should be able to dedicate their full attention to fulfilling that role.  \n4.2.7.\
  \  The issue is not unique to New Zealand.  The United Kingdom Rail Accident Investigation\
  \ \nBranch and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have both identified safety\
  \ issues at \nprotected rail maintenance worksites in recent reports.  The two agencies\
  \ identified that rail \ninfrastructure maintenance operators in both countries\
  \ had been  experiencing about one \nincident each work day  in separately defined\
  \ periods between 2009 and 2014 . \n4.2.8.  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch\
  \ has recommended that an action plan be developed to \nreduce the risk s associated\
  \ with worksite  protection  (Class investigation into irregularities with \nprotection\
  \ arrangements during infrastructure engineering work) . \n4.2.9.  On 8 August 2016\
  \ KiwiRail introduced a plan  to reduce  the risks of track occupation incidents\
  \ \nby separating out the r ail protection officer and work supervisor (team leader\
  \ ) roles .  \nAdditionally , new position s were to be created called protection\
  \ planners , which would  be \nresponsible for ensuring that worksites had the appropriate\
  \ level s of worker  protection . \n4.2.10.  KiwiRail implemented the plan o n 31\
  \ May 2017 .  Twenty -one new protection planners and  \nworksite protector positions\
  \ were created and most of the positions hav e been filled with \nqualified workers.\
  \  Based on this safety action taken by KiwiRail the Commission did not issue \n\
  a proposed recommendation to KiwiRail to address this safety issue.  \n4.3. Non-technical\
  \ skills  \nSafety issue - none of the workers , including the production manager\
  \ , had been trained in or \nhad any knowledge of KiwiRail's non -technical skills\
  \ practices.  The application of  these skills \ncould have prevented this incident\
  \ . \n4.3.1.  Neither the rail protection officer nor any of the workers or the\
  \ two managers could recall if \nKiwiRail had ever provided them with non -technical\
  \ skills training.  Non-technical skills \n(previ ously known as crew resource management)\
  \ are a set of skills  designed to create a safe \nworking environment  by, amongst\
  \ other things, encourag ing teamwork , improving \ncommunication skills, and improv\
  \ ing situational awareness.  \n  \n \nFinal Report RO -2015 -103 \n<< Page 9 >>\n\
  \ 4.3.2.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board of the United Kingdom  defined non\
  \ -technical skills as \n\"the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that\
  \ complement technical skills and \ncontribute to safe and efficient task performance\
  \ \".  While technical skills d escribe what you \nneed to do and know for a given\
  \ safety -critical task, non -technical skills describe how you do \nthat task.\
  \   The non -technical skill components can be broken down further into sub -categories\
  \ \nthat include situational awareness, conscientiousn ess, communication, decision\
  \ -making and \naction, co -operation and working with others, workload management\
  \ and self -management.  \n4.3.3.  Analyses of incident and accident reports within\
  \ the rail industry conducted by the Rail Safety \nand Standards Board showed that\
  \ t he majority of errors that occur relate to people at the front \nline (63%)\
  \ rather than management (30%) or design factors (7%).  Making mistakes is \ninevitable\
  \ , but the use of non -technical skills has been shown to help mitigate and manage\
  \ \nthese errors.  \n4.3.4.  For example, Queensland Rail reported that trainee\
  \ train drivers who did not complete non -\ntechnical skills training were more\
  \ than twice as likely to pass a signal at danger within their \nfirst month than\
  \  those who had received the training.  Similarly, Canadia n Pacific Railway \n\
  reported a 46% reduction in human -caused incidents following non -technical skills\
  \ training.  \n4.3.5.  A review of the recorded radio transmissions between the\
  \ rail protection officer and the train \ncontroller on the day of the incident\
  \ showed th at communications were good.  \n4.3.6.  The rail protection officer\
  \ was working within the confines of his vehicle when he was \ncommunicating with\
  \ the train controller and recording the event times in his events log book .  \n\
  The vehicle was not equipped with external speake rs to broadcast the radio calls.\
  \   As a result \nthe workers w ere excluded from hearing the radio transmissions\
  \ and were not aware of the \nauthorisation details for train movements through\
  \ the work site.  It would have been helpful if \nthe rail protection officer had\
  \ briefed the workers on the communications and the plan, \nspecifically the whereabouts\
  \ of the passenger train.  \n4.3.7.  Equally, a number of the workers were aware\
  \ that the passenger train would be close ly \nfollowing the freight train that\
  \ had just passed through the worksite.  It would have been \nuseful for them to\
  \ have  questioned the rail protection officer about the whereabouts of the \npassenger\
  \ train, rather than silently following his lead and locking back on to the worksite\
  \ . \n4.3.8.  Either scenario would have been a good example of non -technical skills\
  \ at work, an d either \nwould highly likely have prevented the incident.  \n4.3.9.\
  \  The absence of any challenge from the workers was  in part likely to have been\
  \ a result of a \nrelationship issue b etween the rail protection officer and worker\
  \ s in the team.  Some of the \nworkers said that the relationship issue had created\
  \ a lack of cohesion and unity within the \nteam.  Non-technical skill s training\
  \ is a way or circumventing such a situation and ensuring \nthat it does not interfere\
  \ with achieving the end goal, safely . \n4.3.10.  The Commission has raised the\
  \ issue of non -technical skills in two recent rail occurrence \nreports shortly\
  \ to be published.  Both reports contain reference s to an open recommendation \n\
  made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency in 2012.  The recommendation\
  \ was \nthat the practice of non -technical skills should be recognised in the National\
  \ Rail System \nStandards.  \n4.3.11.  On 26 October 2016 KiwiRail provided th e\
  \ Commission with an updated implementation plan \nto develop non -technical skills\
  \ within its workforce.  The plan stated that non -technical skills \nhad to  be\
  \ embedded and promoted in the workforce in order to build a strong safety culture.\
  \  \nThe plan showed t hat between 2014 and 2016 the following number of KiwiRail\
  \ workers had \nparticipated in training programmes that included the principles\
  \ of non -technical -skills:  \n2014  2015  2016  2017 \n(proposed)  \n337 502 638\
  \ 625 \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO -2015 -103 4.3.12.  On 3 April 2017 the\
  \ NZ Transport Agency said that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail on \naddressing\
  \ the recommendation.  The NZ Transport A gency added that it had issued a safety\
  \ \nimprovement plan notice during December 2016 in accordance with section 36 of\
  \ the \nRailways Act 2005 requiring KiwiRail to prepare a safety improvement plan\
  \ to address the \nimplementation of non -technical skills in its rail operations.\
  \   \n4.3.13.  The Commission will not be making a further recommendation on this\
  \ matter.  \n4.4. Drugs and alcohol  \nSafety issue - the rail protection officer\
  \  tested positive for methamphetamine during a post -\nincident drug and alcohol\
  \ test.  Under KiwiRail's random testing policy, only 10% of workers \nwere tested\
  \ each year.  The rail protection officer had not been teste d for 10 years.  \n\
  4.4.1.  People in safety -critical roles using  any performance -impairing substance\
  \ s is a serious safety \nissue.  The rail protection officer said that he had begun\
  \ to inhale methamphetamine with \nsome friends about once per week during the months\
  \ lead ing up to the death of his close \nfriend.  The results  of the post-incident\
  \ drug and alcohol test  exceeded detection thresholds , \nwhich according to research\
  \  is an indication that the most recent  usage had occurred in the \nweek preceding\
  \ the incident . \n4.4.2.  The r esearch d iscussion of  methamphetamine on cognition\
  \ is divided into three main  \ncategories:  \n\uF0B7 the acute effects that occur\
  \ shortly after the  drug has been administered  \n\uF0B7 the long -term effects\
  \ of repeated use  \n\uF0B7 the effects  on cognitive functioning.  \n4.4.3.  It\
  \ is d ifficult to predict  precisely what level of cognitive impairment the methamphetamine\
  \ had \non the rail protection officer' s performance on the day of the incident\
  \  and throughout the \nprevious 15 incident -free days . \n4.4.4.  The rail protection\
  \ officer 's recall  of having last used methamphetamine  three  days prior to \n\
  the incident is consistent with the findings  of the post -incident test.  His story\
  \ of recent \nmethamphetamine use in relation to the death of his friend and the\
  \ fact of his continuing to \nfulfil his wo rk tasks suggest ed that he neither\
  \ was a heavy user nor had any accumulated \neffects of protracted drug use.  \n\
  4.4.5.  It was unlikely that the rail protection officer was impaired at the time\
  \ of the incident, although \nhe may have been in the days prior to the incide nt.\
  \  The short duration of methamphetamine \nuse would suggest that he was not likely\
  \ to have experienced chronic impairment by the drug.  \n4.4.6.  This incident is\
  \ the fourth rail occurrence investigated by the Commission where a person at \n\
  the centre of an investigat ion h as tested positive for illicit substance s during\
  \ a post -incident \ndrug and alcohol test .  The three previous occasions were\
  \ at North Junction ( KiwiRail \nmaintenance worker) on 25 August 2011, at Melling\
  \ ( KiwiRail train driver)  on 27 May 2014 \nand at Morningside ( Transdev Auckland\
  \ Limited train driver) on 29 January 2015.  \n4.4.7.  The Commission has an open\
  \ recommendation addressing the issue that under no \ncircumstances should the performance\
  \ of any rail worker performing any safety -critical task be \naffected by  alcohol\
  \ or drugs of any kind .  On 19 April 2013  the Commission recommend ed \nthat the\
  \ Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System\
  \ \nStandard executive in developing a standard that requires all rail participants\
  \ to have drug \nand alcohol policies that : \n\uF0B7 have zero tolerance of performance\
  \ -impairing substances for workers engaged in \nsafety -critical tasks  \n\uF0B7\
  \ require post -incident and -accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol\
  \  \n\uF0B7 require a system for rail workers to report discree tly co -workers\
  \ suspected of using or \nbeing under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace\
  \ . (007/13)  \n \nFinal Report RO -2015 -103 \n<< Page 11 >>\n The NZ Transport\
  \ Agency replied  on 24 April 2013 that the recommendation had been  \naccepted\
  \  and d iscussion s on it w ould be initiated  on the publica tion of the final\
  \ report.  These \ndiscussions w ould include, where appropriate, a projected timeframe\
  \ for implementation.  \nThis w ould be advised to the Commission i n due course.\
  \   At the time of compiling this report, \nthis recommendation remains open.  \n\
  4.4.8.  The Commission placed substance impairment on its watch list and published\
  \ the watch list \nreport  titled Substance Use: Regulatory Environm ent for Preventing\
  \ Performance Impairm ent, \nto highlight its concerns about the level of drug and\
  \ alcohol use in the New  Zealand transport \nsector . \n4.4.9.  KiwiRail's records\
  \ of random drug and alcohol tests  for the three  years from 2013  to 2015 \nshowed\
  \ that 95% of  the positive r esults had related  to employees working in its safety\
  \ -critical \ninfrastructure maintenance and train operat ions areas .  KiwiRail's\
  \ practi ce of randomly testing \n10% of its workforce annually means that an individual\
  \ is potentially tested once every 10 \nyears , which is consistent with the rail\
  \ protection officer not having been randomly tested in \nthe previous 10 years.\
  \   Random testing is more useful than post -incident testing, as it is \ndesigned\
  \ to act as a deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents  instead of finding\
  \ out after \nthe event.  The more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the\
  \ deterrent.  \n4.4.10.  Compara tive rail companies in New Zealand and Australia\
  \ are testing at higher ratios , with \nsome achieving a 50% testing programme during\
  \ a 12-month period.   There would  be a safety \nbenefit if KiwiRail increased\
  \ the percentage of random testing to increase the det errent to \nstaff.   The\
  \ Commission has made a recommendation to KiwiRail to address this safety issue.\
