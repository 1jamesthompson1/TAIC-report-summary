- the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader, with all of the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety-critical role of rail protection officer. The responsibility for overseeing the sleeper replacement project and ensuring the safety of the workers should never have been placed on one person. In this case, the team leader did have other members of the work group who were qualified to take on the rail protection officer role.
- None of the workers, including the production manager, had been trained in or had any knowledge of KiwiRail's non-technical skills practices. The application of these skills could have prevented this incident. Neither the rail protection officer nor any of the workers or the two managers could recall if KiwiRail had ever provided them with non-technical skills training. Non-technical skills (previously known as crew resource management) are a set of skills designed to create a safe working environment.
- The rail protection officer tested positive for methamphetamine during a post-incident drug and alcohol test. Under KiwiRail's random testing policy, only 10% of workers were tested each year. The rail protection officer had not been tested for 10 years. People in safety-critical roles using any performance-impairing substances is a serious safety issue. The rail protection officer said that he had begun to inhale methamphetamine with some friends about once per week during the months leading up to the death of his close friend.
