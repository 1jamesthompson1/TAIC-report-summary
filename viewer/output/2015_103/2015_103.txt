The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  T he Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 15 December 2015 track m aintenance work ers were replac ing sleepers on Bridge 197 
between Manunui and Taumarunui on the North Island Main Trunk line .  The work site was 
protected by compulsory stop boards , where trains were required to stop and get authority 
from a rail protection officer before pass ing through the worksite .  In this case the rail 
protection officer w as also the team leader responsible for the project.  
1.2. During  the morning  four freight trains pass ed through the worksite without incident.  The 
work ers were already clear of the worksite  when a fifth (passenger) train stopped at the stop 
boards and requested permission to pass through the worksite .  The rail protection officer 
authorised the passenger train to pass through the worksite .  He then engaged in a radio 
conversation with the tr ain controller, left his work vehicle and 'locked on' to let the work ers 
know it was clear to occupy the track.  
1.3. Despite some of the workers knowing that a passenger train was supposed to be due through 
the worksite , all of the m 'locked on' and occupied the  bridge ahead of the approaching train.  
1.4. When the train came into sight, the train driver saw the workers on the bridge ahead and 
stopped his train 72 met res short of the bridge.  There was no collision and no -one was 
injured.  
1.5. The Commission  found  that the rail protection officer's error was highly likely a lapse in 
memory influence d by the pressures he was under in his role as team leader . 
1.6. The Commission also found  that the rail protection officer's error should have been identified 
by others in the work group , and they should have intervened to prevent the incident.  
1.7. The Commission identified three safety issues : 
 that the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader, with all of the tasks and 
responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety -critical role of rail 
protection officer  
 the poor standard of non -technical skills among  all the workers who were on -site 
 the rail protection officer's positive post -incident test result for methamphetamine .  
1.8. KiwiRail has been taking safety action to address  two of the safety issues.  The Commission 
has made one recommendation  to KiwiRail to address the third safety issue.  
1.9. The key lessons  identified from the inquiry were : 
 workers responsible for the safety and wellbeing of track staff should not be allowed 
to be burdened with tasks and responsibilities that will detract from that role  
 the use of good non -technical skills could have prevented this incident.  All operational 
staff need to be trained and well  practi sed in those skills to prevent one -person errors  
resulting in accidents and incidents  
 it is not acceptable under any circumstances for workers to be affected by 
performance -impairing substances, regardless of what role s they are performing.

 Final Report RO -2015 -103 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) of the incident on 16 December 2015.  The Commission opened an inquiry that 
day under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990, and 
appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. The chief investigator of accidents and a recently appointed rail accident investigator travelled 
to Taumarunui on 17 December 2015 to gather evidence and interview the KiwiRail 
maintenance team leader, who was also the  designated rail protection officer1 for the 
worksite . 
2.3. The investigator in charge and the manager  for surface investigations  travelled to Taumarunui 
and Hamilton in early January 2016 to interview : the remaining maintenance workers ; the 
passenger train  driver; the production manager responsible for the project ; and the area 
engineering manager who ha d overall responsibility for the project and the workers . 
2.4. The Commission obtained data from the passenger train 's event recorder , data from the 
signalling system for the area , and the train control voice recording s.  The three data streams 
were synchronised  with written and oral evidence  to determine the sequence of events 
leading up to the incident . 
2.5. The investigator in charge obtained other records and documents relevant to the incident  that 
included : 
 training, certification, assessment and performance records for the rail protection 
officer  
 KiwiRail's post-incident and random drug and alcohol testing polic ies 
 KiwiRail's records of random drug  and alcohol testing results since the polic ies were 
introduced during 2009 and 2010  
 KiwiRail's non -technical skills2 policy and training material  
 details of the safety actions taken by KiwiRail following the incident  
 results of the post -incident drug and alcohol test performed on the rail protection 
officer . 
2.6. On 28 June 2017  the Commission approved a draft report for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.7. Submissions were received from the regulator and the operator whose comments have been 
considered and included in the final report where appropriate.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background information  
3.1.1.  All 405 timber  sleepers required replacing on rail Bridge 197  located between Manunui and 
Taumarunui on the North Islan d Main Trunk line.  The work  started on 25 November 2015 , 
and was scheduled t o be complet ed within eight working days . 
3.1.2.  KiwiRail  assembled a team of six maintenance workers from several depots in the upper 
North Island to perform the work.   A team leader from Taumarunui was responsible for 
manag ing the project .  He appointed himself as the rail protection officer for the worksite .  
This person is mostly referred to as the rail protection officer in this report.  
3.2. Track safety rules 
3.2.1.  KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 902  described how maintenance workers and vehicles were to be 
managed under the direction of a rail protection officer .  Each worker was provided with a  
numbered padlock and a key that were  registered against their  name on an approved form .  
When the rail protection officer had confirmed  that it was safe for the work ers to occupy the 
track, he attached his own padlock to a lock-on frame.  Each w orker  was then required to lock 
their padlock to  the frame  before occupying the track  (see Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1  
A lock -on frame with padlocks secured  
3.2.2.  The reverse process applied when it became necessary to clear the worksite for a train  or on 
the completion of work for the day .  The maintenance workers were required to  unlock and 
remove their padlocks from the lock -on frame after they reached the designated safe place .  
The process was supervised by t he rail protection officer , and when all other padlocks had 
been removed he then removed his own padlock . 
3.2.3.  KiwiRail's Track Safety Rule 905 described how maintenance workers were to be  protected 
from passing trains.  The trains were required to stop at compulsory stop boards (stop boards) .  
The stop boards were positioned a minimum of 500 metres from both ends of a worksite.   For 
northbou nd trains a stop board was placed adjacent to a signal, which the train controller held 
at red until the rail protection officer asked them  to change it to green to allow the passage of 
a train through the worksite . 
3.2.4.  The t rain driver  would contact  the rail protection officer by radio to obtain  authority  to pass the 
stop boards and travel through the wor ksite .  The rail protection officer would give  
authorisation after all maintenance workers had removed their padlocks from the lock-on 
frame .  The rail protection officer would maintain an overview of the assembled workers in the 
designated safe place while the train travelled through the worksite .

 Final Report RO -2015 -103 3.3. The incident  
3.3.1.  The maintenance workers assembled at Bridge 197 from  0700 on 5 December 2015 , 15 
working days after the start of the project .  During the morning three trains passed through the 
worksite  without incident . 
3.3.2.  A production manager  arrived at the worksite at about 1300 to discuss  the project with the rail 
protection officer . 
3.3.3.  At 1345 t he rail protection officer instructed the maintenance workers and the production 
manager to clear the worksite for the passage of two trains: a northbound freight train  and the 
northbound Northern Explorer passenger train  (the passenger train) .  The mainte nance 
workers assembled in the designated safe place  and removed their padlocks from the lock -on 
frame . 
3.3.4.  The freight train stopped at the stop boards and requested authority to pass through the 
worksite .  At 1349 the rail protection officer requested  the train controller to change the 
adjacent signal from red to green,  then  authorised the freight train driver to pass the stop 
boards at Manunui (see Figure 2) . 
 
Figure 2  
The stop boards and signal at Manunui  (looking north)  
3.3.5.  At about 1355 s ome of the maintenance workers questioned the rail protection officer 
regarding the whereabouts of the passenger train  after the freight train had passed .  He 
returned to his work vehicle , referred to an information display syste m he was using and saw 
that the passenger train was nearing Manunui.  
3.3.6.  The passenger train stopped at the stop boards and requested permission to pass through the 
worksite  while the rail protection officer was in his  vehicle .  At 1415  he radioed the train 
controller and asked him to switch the signal to green and authorised the passenger train  to 
pass the stop boards .  The rail protection officer instructed t he train driver to slow his speed to 
40 kilometres per hour  through the worksite.   Following that, he had a radio conversation with 
the train controller about the order of the next two trains that were scheduled to pass through 
the worksite.

Final Report RO -2015 -103 
<< Page 5 >>
 3.3.7.  None of the maintenance workers or the production manager who were all as sembled nearby 
at the safe place heard the radio conversations.  Some KiwiRail vehicles are fitted with 
external speakers for radio s, but they were not fitted to the rail protection officer 's vehicle.  
The rail protection officer recorded the times of the radio calls in compliance with KiwiRail's 
Track Safety Rule 905 .  Although the information he recorded was correct , it was written on 
the wrong page  in his events log book . 
3.3.8.  The rail protection officer left his vehicle and returned to the safe place  after recording the 
times of the radio calls .  He then secured his padlock to the lock -on frame  in spite of having 
just authorised the  passenger train to pass through the worksite .  None of the workers 
question ed the rail protection officer on the whereab outs of the  passenger train .  They all 
secured their padlocks to the frame and some of them walked back onto the bridge with their 
equipment to resume work.  
3.3.9.  Meanwhile  the passenger train had passed the stop boards and reached a speed of 72 
kilometres per hour .  The driver began to slow his train  when he was 590 metres from the 
bridge .  He then noticed t he maintenance workers and equipment on the bridge  ahead and 
brought his train to a stop  72 metres from the bridge .  There was no collision and no -one was 
injured . 
3.3.10.  The rail protection officer realised an incident had occurred and telephoned the train 
controller to report the incident.  The rail protection officer was relieved of his duties . 
3.4. The rail protection officer  
3.4.1.  The rail protection officer had worked fo r KiwiRail for 10 years and his licen ce to operate was 
valid .  He held curren t competency for KiwiRail's Track Safety Rules 902 and 905.  His work 
experience was mostly bridge maintenance similar to  that being carried out on Bridge 197.  
3.4.2.  Following this incident he underwent a mandatory post -incident drug and alcohol test.  The 
urine test returned a positive result to methamphetamine and its metabolite amphetamine.  
3.4.3.  The rail protection officer was aware of KiwiRail's drug and alcohol policy , which  included  
random testing.  He said that he had not been required to undergo a random drug and alcohol 
test during his 10 -year career with KiwiRail.  
3.4.4.  The rail protection officer later said that he had been struggling to cope with all of his  
responsibilities  at work, particularly the late running of the  project and a relationship issue 
that existed between himself and one of the workers .  He said that he had also been affected 
by the death of a close friend three weeks  earlier . 
3.4.5.  The rail protection officer said that he had started inhaling methamphetamine during the last 
months of his friend's life and had continued during the three -week period between his 
friend's death and th is incident.  He said that he had last inhaled methamphetamine three 
days prior to the incident . 
3.5. Methamphetamine /Amphetamine  
3.5.1.  The effects that methamphetamine /amphetamine can have on individuals are complex .  The 
half-life of methamphetamine  in a person's body is about 24 hours, but can be longer .  Some 
authors3 have  pointed out  the different  effects that they have seen.  "Low single doses may 
stimulate performance , while on the other hand, h igh dose s, which  often  indicate chronic 
abuse , may decrease human related performance  with displays of irrational behaviour ."

 Final Report RO -2015 -103 3.6. Drug and alcohol  testing  
3.6.1.  KiwiRail introduced its post -incident drug and alcohol testing policy and associated 
procedures during 2009  (see Appendix 1) in agreement with the Rail and Maritime Transport 
Union  (RMTU) .  The p olicy said that an employee would  be asked to submit to a test following 
an incident or accident if that person had had a direct involvement.  KiwiRail provided some 
examples of the types of incident/accident to assist its managers in carrying out this process.  
3.6.2.  In this case the rail protec tion officer and the driver of the passenger train were tested, but 
none of the other track maintenance staff were  tested.  
3.6.3.  The policy between KiwiRail and the R MTU  was extended to include random  drug and alcohol  
testing during 2010 .  KiwiRail and the RMTU  both  stated that one of the objective s of the 
policy was that they wanted  their employee s and members to be safe at work.   KiwiRail also 
introduced similar policies that covered  members of  its workforce who were not members of 
the RMTU  (see Appendix 2).  
3.6.4.  KiwiRail said that it randomly test ed 10% of its workforce  annually  at all levels of the business .  
The company retest ed an employee who initially return ed a positive result , then facilitate d a 
rehabilitation programme .  
3.6.5.  By comparison , the Australian rail regulatory authority introduced a requirement during early 
2012 for rail operating companies  throughout the count ry to test their workers  randomly  for 
drugs and alcohol .  The Australian authority stipulated that 25% of rail safety worker s must be 
tested annually . 
3.6.6.  Queensland Rail random ly tests 50% of its safety -critical workers annually , includ ing track 
maintenance workers . 
3.6.7.  Four other New Zealand licensed rail participants said that it was policy for them to randomly 
test between 25% and 100% of their workers annually.  
3.6.8.  An independent review of KiwiRail's random drug and alcohol test results conducted between 
July 2014 and June 2015 showed that 18 out of 1,013 individuals had returned positive 
results .  All the positive results had been  for drugs.  All but one of the 18 individuals had 
worked in KiwiRail's operational sectors that included train drivers and track  maintenance 
workers.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Protecting  workers who are maintaining rail tracks is a safety -critical process that carries a 
high level of responsibility.  Any lack of adherence to the process for facilitating such 
protection can have severe consequences.  In this instance there would have been  nowhere 
for the w orkers to escape to had the train crossed the bridge.  
4.1.2.  In human factor terms the type of error the rail protection officer made in locking on to the 
frame when he had just authorised the passenger train to pass through the worksite  is 
considered a 'lapse4'.  It was not an intentional act and it was not a knowledge -based error.  
The rail protection off icer knew what the correct procedure was and had successfully 
undertaken  it for the passage of four other trains that day. 
4.1.3.  However, such an error need not resul t in an accident or incident.  There were opportunities 
for the other workers  involved to intervene and prevent it happening.  
4.1.4.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau identified in a report  (Safety Issues Investigation - Safe 
work on t rack)  that the majority of incidents in Australia could  be attributable to individual 
actions rather than environmental or organisational influences.  In this case  the individual 
actions of the rail protection officer were a factor.  However, there were also organisational 
factors that influenced the actions of those involved.  
4.1.5.  The reasons for such a lapse are discussed below.  Also discussed are three safety issues:  
 the first safety issue was that the KiwiRail system al lowed the team leader, with all of 
the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety -critical 
role of rail protection officer  
 the second safety issue was the poor standard of non -technical skills among  all the 
workers who were  on site 
 the third safety issue was the rail protection officer's positive  post-incident  test result 
for methamphetamine.  
4.1.6.  The rail protection officer and the maintenance  worker s should not have locked their  padlock s 
to the frame  and been allowed to proceed on to the track until the passenger train had 
passed.   The situation could have been prevented if the workers had questi oned the rail 
protection officer as to the whereabouts of the passenger train.   A more serious incident might 
have occurred but for the slow speed request made to the train driver by the rail protection 
officer.  
4.2. Rail protection officer or team leader  
Safety issue - the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader, with all of the tasks and  
responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety -critical role of rail protection 
officer . 
4.2.1.  The responsibilit y for overseeing the sleeper replacement project and ensuring the safety of 
the work ers should never have been placed on one perso n.  In this case the team leader did 
have other members of the work g roup who were qualified to take on the rail protection officer 
role.  However, because of personal and professional issues within the team, he felt more 
comfortable taking on the role him self.

omissions - when someone fails to do something due to lapses in memory and/or distraction.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report RO -2015 -103 4.2.2.  The rail protection officer was under considerable pressure at the time of the incident, mainly  
related to his responsibilities as team leader.  The project was significantly behind time, 
although this was mainly related to KiwiRail's resourcing of t he project.  
4.2.3.  A princip al reason for the project running late was the scaffolding arrangements  put in place 
to provide the maintenance workers with a safe platform  from which to work.  Insufficient 
equipment had been provided to scaffold the whole length of the bridge  for the duration of the 
project .  As sleeper replacement work progressed , scaffolding was removed and re -secured 
along small sections o f the bridge .  It was a  task that took about two hours each day  and that 
had an adverse effect on the project timeline.  
4.2.4.  Additionally the production manager , who was on site at the time of the incident , and the area 
engineering manager had been closely  monitoring the rail protection officer 's performance  
after a number of previous alleged performance issues relating to the late running of projects 
for which he was responsible .  The rail protection officer said that the manager's presence  had 
increased the pressure he was already feeling  on the day . 
4.2.5.  At the time of the incident , the eight -day project  was only 5 0% complete after 15 days.  The 
rail protection officer was unable to see a way to catch up despite working in his own time.  He 
said he had become overwhelmed with the responsibility of managing all aspects of the 
project . 
4.2.6.  The rail protection officer' s error in allowing the wor kers to on -track ahead of the passenger 
train is symptomatic of what James Reason describes as 'lapses in memory and/or 
distraction'.  The rail protection officer was clearly distracted by stressors associated with his 
other role s.  This incident is a good example of why staff assigned to the safety -critical role of 
rail protection officer should be able to dedicate their full attention to fulfilling that role.  
4.2.7.  The issue is not unique to New Zealand.  The United Kingdom Rail Accident Investigation 
Branch and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have both identified safety issues at 
protected rail maintenance worksites in recent reports.  The two agencies identified that rail 
infrastructure maintenance operators in both countries had been  experiencing about one 
incident each work day  in separately defined periods between 2009 and 2014 . 
4.2.8.  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has recommended that an action plan be developed to 
reduce the risk s associated with worksite  protection  (Class investigation into irregularities with 
protection arrangements during infrastructure engineering work) . 
4.2.9.  On 8 August 2016 KiwiRail introduced a plan  to reduce  the risks of track occupation incidents 
by separating out the r ail protection officer and work supervisor (team leader ) roles .  
Additionally , new position s were to be created called protection planners , which would  be 
responsible for ensuring that worksites had the appropriate level s of worker  protection . 
4.2.10.  KiwiRail implemented the plan o n 31 May 2017 .  Twenty -one new protection planners and  
worksite protector positions were created and most of the positions hav e been filled with 
qualified workers.  Based on this safety action taken by KiwiRail the Commission did not issue 
a proposed recommendation to KiwiRail to address this safety issue.  
4.3. Non-technical skills  
Safety issue - none of the workers , including the production manager , had been trained in or 
had any knowledge of KiwiRail's non -technical skills practices.  The application of  these skills 
could have prevented this incident . 
4.3.1.  Neither the rail protection officer nor any of the workers or the two managers could recall if 
KiwiRail had ever provided them with non -technical skills training.  Non-technical skills 
(previ ously known as crew resource management) are a set of skills  designed to create a safe 
working environment  by, amongst other things, encourag ing teamwork , improving 
communication skills, and improv ing situational awareness.  
  
 
Final Report RO -2015 -103 
<< Page 9 >>
 4.3.2.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board of the United Kingdom  defined non -technical skills as 
"the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and 
contribute to safe and efficient task performance ".  While technical skills d escribe what you 
need to do and know for a given safety -critical task, non -technical skills describe how you do 
that task.   The non -technical skill components can be broken down further into sub -categories 
that include situational awareness, conscientiousn ess, communication, decision -making and 
action, co -operation and working with others, workload management and self -management.  
4.3.3.  Analyses of incident and accident reports within the rail industry conducted by the Rail Safety 
and Standards Board showed that t he majority of errors that occur relate to people at the front 
line (63%) rather than management (30%) or design factors (7%).  Making mistakes is 
inevitable , but the use of non -technical skills has been shown to help mitigate and manage 
these errors.  
4.3.4.  For example, Queensland Rail reported that trainee train drivers who did not complete non -
technical skills training were more than twice as likely to pass a signal at danger within their 
first month than  those who had received the training.  Similarly, Canadia n Pacific Railway 
reported a 46% reduction in human -caused incidents following non -technical skills training.  
4.3.5.  A review of the recorded radio transmissions between the rail protection officer and the train 
controller on the day of the incident showed th at communications were good.  
4.3.6.  The rail protection officer was working within the confines of his vehicle when he was 
communicating with the train controller and recording the event times in his events log book .  
The vehicle was not equipped with external speake rs to broadcast the radio calls.   As a result 
the workers w ere excluded from hearing the radio transmissions and were not aware of the 
authorisation details for train movements through the work site.  It would have been helpful if 
the rail protection officer had briefed the workers on the communications and the plan, 
specifically the whereabouts of the passenger train.  
4.3.7.  Equally, a number of the workers were aware that the passenger train would be close ly 
following the freight train that had just passed through the worksite.  It would have been 
useful for them to have  questioned the rail protection officer about the whereabouts of the 
passenger train, rather than silently following his lead and locking back on to the worksite . 
4.3.8.  Either scenario would have been a good example of non -technical skills at work, an d either 
would highly likely have prevented the incident.  
4.3.9.  The absence of any challenge from the workers was  in part likely to have been a result of a 
relationship issue b etween the rail protection officer and worker s in the team.  Some of the 
workers said that the relationship issue had created a lack of cohesion and unity within the 
team.  Non-technical skill s training is a way or circumventing such a situation and ensuring 
that it does not interfere with achieving the end goal, safely . 
4.3.10.  The Commission has raised the issue of non -technical skills in two recent rail occurrence 
reports shortly to be published.  Both reports contain reference s to an open recommendation 
made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency in 2012.  The recommendation was 
that the practice of non -technical skills should be recognised in the National Rail System 
Standards.  
4.3.11.  On 26 October 2016 KiwiRail provided th e Commission with an updated implementation plan 
to develop non -technical skills within its workforce.  The plan stated that non -technical skills 
had to  be embedded and promoted in the workforce in order to build a strong safety culture.  
The plan showed t hat between 2014 and 2016 the following number of KiwiRail workers had 
participated in training programmes that included the principles of non -technical -skills:  
2014  2015  2016  2017 
(proposed)  
337 502 638 625 

<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report RO -2015 -103 4.3.12.  On 3 April 2017 the NZ Transport Agency said that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail on 
addressing the recommendation.  The NZ Transport A gency added that it had issued a safety 
improvement plan notice during December 2016 in accordance with section 36 of the 
Railways Act 2005 requiring KiwiRail to prepare a safety improvement plan to address the 
implementation of non -technical skills in its rail operations.   
4.3.13.  The Commission will not be making a further recommendation on this matter.  
4.4. Drugs and alcohol  
Safety issue - the rail protection officer  tested positive for methamphetamine during a post -
incident drug and alcohol test.  Under KiwiRail's random testing policy, only 10% of workers 
were tested each year.  The rail protection officer had not been teste d for 10 years.  
4.4.1.  People in safety -critical roles using  any performance -impairing substance s is a serious safety 
issue.  The rail protection officer said that he had begun to inhale methamphetamine with 
some friends about once per week during the months lead ing up to the death of his close 
friend.  The results  of the post-incident drug and alcohol test  exceeded detection thresholds , 
which according to research  is an indication that the most recent  usage had occurred in the 
week preceding the incident . 
4.4.2.  The r esearch d iscussion of  methamphetamine on cognition is divided into three main  
categories:  
 the acute effects that occur shortly after the  drug has been administered  
 the long -term effects of repeated use  
 the effects  on cognitive functioning.  
4.4.3.  It is d ifficult to predict  precisely what level of cognitive impairment the methamphetamine had 
on the rail protection officer' s performance on the day of the incident  and throughout the 
previous 15 incident -free days . 
4.4.4.  The rail protection officer 's recall  of having last used methamphetamine  three  days prior to 
the incident is consistent with the findings  of the post -incident test.  His story of recent 
methamphetamine use in relation to the death of his friend and the fact of his continuing to 
fulfil his wo rk tasks suggest ed that he neither was a heavy user nor had any accumulated 
effects of protracted drug use.  
4.4.5.  It was unlikely that the rail protection officer was impaired at the time of the incident, although 
he may have been in the days prior to the incide nt.  The short duration of methamphetamine 
use would suggest that he was not likely to have experienced chronic impairment by the drug.  
4.4.6.  This incident is the fourth rail occurrence investigated by the Commission where a person at 
the centre of an investigat ion h as tested positive for illicit substance s during a post -incident 
drug and alcohol test .  The three previous occasions were at North Junction ( KiwiRail 
maintenance worker) on 25 August 2011, at Melling ( KiwiRail train driver)  on 27 May 2014 
and at Morningside ( Transdev Auckland Limited train driver) on 29 January 2015.  
4.4.7.  The Commission has an open recommendation addressing the issue that under no 
circumstances should the performance of any rail worker performing any safety -critical task be 
affected by  alcohol or drugs of any kind .  On 19 April 2013  the Commission recommend ed 
that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System 
Standard executive in developing a standard that requires all rail participants to have drug 
and alcohol policies that : 
 have zero tolerance of performance -impairing substances for workers engaged in 
safety -critical tasks  
 require post -incident and -accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol  
 require a system for rail workers to report discree tly co -workers suspected of using or 
being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace . (007/13)  
 
Final Report RO -2015 -103 
<< Page 11 >>
 The NZ Transport Agency replied  on 24 April 2013 that the recommendation had been  
accepted  and d iscussion s on it w ould be initiated  on the publica tion of the final report.  These 
discussions w ould include, where appropriate, a projected timeframe for implementation.  
This w ould be advised to the Commission i n due course.   At the time of compiling this report, 
this recommendation remains open.  
4.4.8.  The Commission placed substance impairment on its watch list and published the watch list 
report  titled Substance Use: Regulatory Environm ent for Preventing Performance Impairm ent, 
to highlight its concerns about the level of drug and alcohol use in the New  Zealand transport 
sector . 
4.4.9.  KiwiRail's records of random drug and alcohol tests  for the three  years from 2013  to 2015 
showed that 95% of  the positive r esults had related  to employees working in its safety -critical 
infrastructure maintenance and train operat ions areas .  KiwiRail's practi ce of randomly testing 
10% of its workforce annually means that an individual is potentially tested once every 10 
years , which is consistent with the rail protection officer not having been randomly tested in 
the previous 10 years.   Random testing is more useful than post -incident testing, as it is 
designed to act as a deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents  instead of finding out after 
the event.  The more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.  
4.4.10.  Compara tive rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios , with 
some achieving a 50% testing programme during a 12-month period.   There would  be a safety 
benefit if KiwiRail increased the percentage of random testing to increase the det errent to 
staff.   The Commission has made a recommendation to KiwiRail to address this safety issue.

 Final Report RO -2015 -103 5. Findings  
5.1. The passenger train involved in the incident was being operated in accordance with KiwiRail 
rules and procedures, an d in accordance with the instructions of the train controller and the 
rail protection officer.  
5.2. The work ers were authorised by the rail protection officer to occupy the track ahead and in the 
path of the approaching passenger train.  The rail protection off icer's error was highly likely a 
lapse in memory influence d by the pressures he was under in his role as team leader . 
5.3. The rail protection officer's error could  have been picked up and nullified by any of the other 
staff on site if they had been trained in and working to a good standard of non -technical skills . 
5.4. Post-incident drug and alcohol tests found a detectable level of methamphetamine in the rail 
protection officer's urine.  The levels detected and the circumstances around his inhaling the 
drug mean t that he  was unlikely to have been impaired at the time of the incident.  However, it 
was possible that he had been impaired during the preceding days after last in haling the drug, 
while undertaking a safety -critical role.  
5.5. It is unlikely that the frequency o f KiwiRail's random drug and alcohol testing acted as a 
sufficient deterrent to workers working under the influence of performance -impairing 
substances.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 16 December 2016 KiwiRail's Group General Manager, Network Services, em ailed his 
infrastructure line managers seeking assurance that the managers took worksite safety 
seriously.  This included using vehicles at worksites with external speakers and having a 
second person listen in on radio transmissions with train control, train drivers and hi -rail 
vehicle users.  Managers were to ensure that maintenance workers came to work in a fit state 
and were not impaired by fatigue or drugs/alcohol.  Manager s were also to check that 
paperwork was being completed  correctly , and audit completed paperwork for clarity and 
accuracy.  Lastly managers were to be clear about the roles their maintenance workers were 
undertaking at worksites.  
6.3. On 1 February 2016 KiwiRail issued a Toolbox Topic titled Importance of Crew Resource 
Managemen t.  The document gave three examples of crew resource management at 
work sites that prevented incidents occurring.  
6.4. On 1 February 2016 KiwiRail issued a Toolbox Topic titled Competency Card  - Go Live Date.  
The card was to become effective on 29 February 201 6.  Every KiwiRail worker operating at an 
infrastructure work site was required to carry the card on their person as proof that their 
competencies were valid and current.  
6.5. During April 2016 KiwiRail issued a Rule of the Week document to its infrastructure workers , 
highlighting the need to co -ordinate the movement of rail vehicles within protected worksite s 
such as that at Bridge 197 . 
6.6. On 1 July 2016 KiwiRail posted a new engineering services task instruction titled Use of the 
Work site Entry Train Alert Syste m.  The document described the components, features, use 
and basic fault -finding of the electronic system for use in the field.  KiwiRail issued semi -
permanent bulletin 511 , dated 3 August 2016 , promulgating the trial installation of the 
Worksite Entry Tra in Alert as from 8 August 2016.  
6.7. On 8 August 2016 KiwiRail issue d a Toolbox Topic titled Consultation Document  - Change 
Proposal for Track Protection.  The document explained KiwiRail's plan to reduce  the risks of 
track occupation incidents occurring by for mally splitting out the rail protection officer and 
work supervisor (team leader ) roles and having all planned work sites approved by protection 
planners.  
6.8. On 7 November 2016 KiwiRail provided the Commission with a safety update on its 
Interceptor system , which built on the established and operating Watchdog system (originated 
from a 2007 Commission recommendation) and the established and operating Eprotect 
system (September 2016).  The Interceptor system is expected to start trials from June 2017.  
The syste m will intervene with a brake application on a freight or passenger train that does not 
stop at a compulsory stop board protecting a worksite , such as Bridge 197 in this instance.  
6.9. On 31 May 2017 KiwiRail updated the Commission on its August 2016 plan to se parate the 
rail protection officer and work supervisor (team leader ) roles and hav e all planned worksite s 
approved by protection planners.  KiwiRail provided a copy of the organisational chart that 
showed the structure and the members who had been appointe d to the roles.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report RO -2015 -103 6.10.  On 3 August 2017 the NZ Transport Agency updated the Commission that it has required 
KiwiRail to develop a safety improvement plan to raise the standard of non -technical skills 
training to its "at risk" staff. This request for a safety impr ovement plan has resulted in KiwiRail 
providing the Transport Agency with a 16 -page document setting out their agreed actions and 
deadlines for implementation.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , a recommendation ha s been issued to  the Chief Executive of KiwiRail 
with notice of the recommendation given to   the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemen ted without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation  to KiwiRail  
7.3. KiwiRail's records of random drug and alcohol tests for the three  years from 2013 to 2015 
showed that 95% of the positive results had relat ed to employees working in its safety -critical 
infrastructure maintenance and train operations areas.  KiwiRail's practice of randomly testing 
10% of its workforce annually means that an individual is potentially tested once every 10 
years, which is consis tent with the rail protection officer not having been randomly tested in 
the previous 10 years.   
Random testing is more useful than post -incident testing, as it is designed to act as a 
deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents instead of finding out a fter the event.  The 
more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.  
Comparative rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios , with 
some achieving a 50% testing programme within a 12-month period.  
The Commission re commends to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail  that he address KiwiRail's  
low-ratio random testing programme .  (023/17)  
7.3.1.  On 7 September 2017, the Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied:  
We confirm that KiwiRail is increasing its random drug and alcohol testing regime 
from 10% per annum to 20% per annum.  This change will take effect from 01 
October 2017.  
As further requested, KiwiRail undertakes to confirm with the Commission once the 
change is fully implemented including confirmation of the implementation date,  a 
description of how it was implemented, and evidence to demonstrate full 
implementation.  
Notice to the NZ Transport Agency of recommendation to KiwiRail  
7.4. KiwiRail's records of random drug and alcohol tests for the three  years from 2013 to 2015 
showed that  95% of the positive results had related  to employees working in its safety -critical 
infrastructure maintenance and train operations areas.  KiwiRail's practice of randomly testing 
10% of its workforce annually means that an individual is potentially teste d once every 10 
years, which is consistent with the rail protection officer not having been randomly tested in 
the previous 10 years.  
Random testing is more useful than post -incident testing, as it is designed to act as a 
deterrent and prevent accidents an d incidents instead of finding out after the event.  The 
more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.  
Comparative rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios , with 
some achieving a 50% testing programme within a 12-month period.  
The Commission gives notice to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that a 
recommendation has been  made  to KiwiRail that it  address KiwiRail's low -ratio random testing 
program me.  (023/17)

 Final Report RO -2015 -103 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Workers responsible for the safety and wellbeing of track staff should not be allowed to be 
burdened with tasks and responsibilities that will detract from that role . 
8.2. The use of good non -technical skills could have prevented this incident.  All operational staff 
need to be trained and well practi sed in those skills to prevent one -person errors resulting in 
accidents and incidents.  
8.3. It is not acceptable under any circumst ances for workers to be affected by performance -
impairing substances , regardless  of what role s they are performing .
