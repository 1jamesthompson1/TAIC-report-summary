2015_103,023/17,The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail that he address KiwiRailâ€™s low-ratio random testing programme.,"KiwiRail's records of random drug and alcohol tests for the three years from 2013 to 2015 showed that 95% of the positive results had related to employees working in its safety-critical infrastructure maintenance and train operations areas. KiwiRail's practice of randomly testing 10% of its workforce annually means that an individual is potentially tested once every 10 years, which is consistent with the rail protection officer not having been randomly tested in the previous 10 years.

Random testing is more useful than post-incident testing, as it is designed to act as a deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents instead of finding out after the event. The more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.

Comparative rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios, with some achieving a 50% testing programme within a 12-month period.
