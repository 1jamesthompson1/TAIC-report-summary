- name: Inadequate Passage Planning and Watchkeeping Standards
  explanation: Inadequate passage planning and watchkeeping standards were a significant safety theme related to the Rena accident. The Rena's passage plan from Napier to Tauranga did not meet the standards documented in the CIEL safety management system, the International Maritime Organization Voyage Planning Guidelines, or best industry practice as documented in The Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - A Practical Guide. The second mate deviated from the passage plan to take the Rena closer to Astrolabe Reef to save time, which unnecessarily increased the risk of the ship running aground and contributed directly to the grounding. The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena for the accident voyage, particularly during the watch period when the grounding occurred, did not comply with the requirements of the STCW Convention, the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines, the CIEL safety management system, or industry best practice ("the rena's passage plan from napier to tauranga on the accident voyage did not meet the standards documented in the ciel safety management system or the international maritime organization voyage planning guidelines" (4.2.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the second mate deviated from the passage plan to take the rena closer to astrolabe reef to save time" (4.2.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the standard of watchkeeping on board the rena for the accident voyage, and particularly for the watch period during which the grounding occurred, in almost all respects did not comply with the requirements of the stcw convention" (4.2)).
- name: Fatigue Management
  explanation: Fatigue management was another safety theme relevant to the accident. The master's work and sleep schedule in the days preceding the accident placed him at risk of impaired cognitive performance due to fatigue. The second mate's work and sleep schedule also indicated at least a mild to moderate risk of cognitive performance impairment due to fatigue. The performance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period leading up to the grounding, although there was insufficient evidence to determine whether their actions leading up to the grounding were attributable to fatigue ("the master's work and sleep schedule in the three days preceding the accident placed him at risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue" (4.4.10 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the second mate's work and sleep schedule in the three days before the accident meant that there was, at least, a mild to moderate risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue" (4.4.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Deficiencies in Safety Management Systems
  explanation: Deficiencies in safety management systems were a critical safety theme in this accident. The crew of the Rena were not following navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the safety management system onboard the Rena for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding. The number of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena and its detention for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicate that the safety management system as applied onboard the Rena was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code ("the master and crew of the rena were not following navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the safety management system onboard the rena for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding" (4.5), "the number of port state control deficiencies identified against the rena and its detention in fremantle for non-compliance with statutory requirements indicate that the safety management system as applied onboard the rena was not meeting the objectives of the ism code" (5.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Inadequate Seafarer Training and Certification Systems
  explanation: Inadequate seafarer training and certification systems were identified as a safety theme. Independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training, and certification system did not meet the standards specified by the STCW Convention at both systemic and training institute levels. The Liberian Registry recognized by endorsement certificates issued by the Philippines in accordance with STCW Convention Regulation I/10, when independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training, and certification system did not meet the standards specified in the STCW Convention ("Independent audits had found that the Philippine seafarer training system did not meet the standards specified by the STCW Convention at both systemic and training institute levels" (4.6.14), "The Liberian Registry recognised by endorsement certificates issued by the Philippines in accordance with STCW Convention Regulation I/10, when independent audits found that the Philippines' maritime education, training and certification system did not meet the standards specified in the STCW [95] Convention" (4.6.30)).
- name: Lack of Transparency in Seafarer Training Audits
  explanation: Lack of transparency in seafarer training audits emerged as a safety theme. The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries' maritime education, training, and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess easily whether to recognize the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant with STCW standards. Better transparency of this process could avoid unnecessary duplication and expedite the harmonization of global seafarer training and certification systems ("the stcw convention protocols for auditing countries' maritime education, training and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess easily whether to recognise the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant with stcw convention standards" (4.6.36 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Inadequate Use of Navigational Aids
  explanation: Inadequate use of navigational aids was a safety theme related to the accident. Although Astrolabe Reef was well displayed as a danger to navigation on the chart being used by the Rena bridge team, the absence of a physical light beacon on the reef was noted as a factor that, if present, likely would have prevented the grounding. The use of modern and accurate navigation systems for avoiding such navigational dangers, and the potential for future advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation, were also discussed ("a light beacon placed on astrolabe reef is another measure that probably would have alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of astrolabe reef, and would likely have prevented the rena grounding" (4.9), "the use of virtual aids to navigation could be one alternative method for highlighting dangers to navigation" (4.9.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
