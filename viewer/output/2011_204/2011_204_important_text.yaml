  \ at near full speed when it ran aground on Astrolabe Reef.  The ship \nand most\
  \ of its cargo was a total loss.  This accident was equivalent to what in aviation\
  \ terms \nis sometimes referred to as controlled flight into terrain - where a fully\
  \ f unctional aircraft \n[ship] is inadvertently flown [navigated] into the ground\
  \ by its crew.  \n4.1.2.  The Commission found  that no technical or mechanical\
  \ failure contributed to the accident.  \nThe ship and its navigational equipment\
  \ were, or were capable of , functioni ng properly.  The \ncrew inadvertently directed\
  \ the ship on a collision course with Astrolabe Reef.  \n4.1.3.  There were a number\
  \ of acts and omissions on the crew's part that directly contributed to the \ngrounding.\
  \  They fundamentally involve d the crew not complying w ith some mandatory \nstandards\
  \ for passage planning and watchkeeping standards that are described in the STCW\
  \  \nConvention .  Those acts and omissions and how they directly contributed to\
  \ the Rena  \ngrounding are described in the first two sections:  \n\uF0B7 planned\
  \ passa ge \n\uF0B7 watchkeeping standards.  \n4.1.4.  To understand why the crew\
  \ did what they did and why they were not complying with \nmandatory standards,\
  \ it is necessary to understand the wider system in which they were \noperating.\
  \  Gaps and safety issues within this wider system can contribute to the way a crew\
  \ \nperforms.  With international shipping that system is a complex arrangement\
  \ between \ninternational and domestic standards  - in this case domestic standards\
  \  for Liberia and the \nPhilippines . \nOverview of the international marit ime\
  \ system  \n4.1.5.  International standards are published by IMO.  IMO facilitat\
  \ es forums, during which member \nstates agree through resolutions on various instruments\
  \ such as conventions, codes and \nguidelines that set or recommend minimum standards\
  \ covering all aspects of ship design, \nconstruction and the way ships  are operated.\
  \  Conventions are mandatory.  Codes can be \nmandatory or n on-mandatory, depending\
  \ on the resolution .  If a code is mandatory it becomes, \nin effect , part of\
  \ any convention to which it relates.   Guidelines are non -mandatory  but are \n\
  generally considered \"best practice\" .  states elect which IMO instruments  they\
  \ will adopt .  \nOnce a s tate signs up to a  mandatory  IMO instrument, it is\
  \ responsible for adopting the \nstandards  in the instrument into  its domestic\
  \ legislation and checking that ships under it s \nregistry comply with them.  \
  \ Refer to Figure 5. \n \nFigure 5 \nDiagram of structure showing IMO instruments\
  \  \n\n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.1.6.  The relevant IMO conventions\
  \ in this case are the SOLAS Convention  and the STCW \nConvention.  \n4.1.7.  The\
  \ main objective of the SOLAS Convention is to set out minimum standards for the\
  \ \nconstruction, equipment and operation of ships, compatible with their safety.\
  \  \n4.1.8.  The main objective of the STCW Convention is to establish basic requirements\
  \ for training, \ncertification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international\
  \ level.   \n4.1.9.  A relevant IMO code in this case is the ISM Code. The purpose\
  \ of the ISM Code is to provide an \ninternational standard for the safe management\
  \ and operation of ships and for pollution \nprevention.   \n4.1.10.  A relevant\
  \ non -mandatory instrument  in this case  is Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines for\
  \ \nVoyage Planning ( the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines) . These guidelines describe\
  \ the \nobjective, development process, content and end use of a passage plan. \
  \ \n4.1.11.  Another guideline relevant to this case is Bridge Team Management -\
  \ a Practical Guide , \npublished by The Nautical Institute9. The Nautical Institute\
  \ is an international representative \nbody for maritime professionals involved\
  \ in the control of sea -going ships. This publication is a \npractical guide that\
  \ sets out how to prepare and execute a navigational plan . While this  \nguideline\
  \  is not mandatory, it sets out  industry best practice.  \n4.1.12.  The Rena \
  \ was owned by a company domiciled in Greece , and it was managed by another \n\
  compan y, CIEL .  The owner placed the Rena  on the Liberia n Registry, and manned\
  \ the ship \nwith Philippine nationals.  \n4.1.13.  Liberia was responsible for\
  \ conducting technical surveys of the Rena  to check  that it was \nmaintained to\
  \ the mandatory national (and IMO) standards.  Liberia could  provide its own \n\
  surveyors to undertake these surveys , but also enter ed into arrangements with\
  \  classification \nsocieties  for their surveyors to undertake the surveys on its\
  \ behalf (usually once annually).  \nLiberia then issue d the Rena  with Liberian\
  \ maritime documents that acknowledge d that the \nmandatory standards ha d been\
  \ met at the time of the survey s. \n4.1.14.  The crew on board the Rena  were required\
  \ to hold Liberian licen ces of competenc e.  Both \nLiberia and the Philippines\
  \ had signed up to the STCW Convention.  The Philippines had a \ndomestic maritime\
  \ education, training and certification system that wa s required to comply \nwith\
  \ the STCW Convention.  It issued Philippine certificates of competenc e to its\
  \ seafarers.  \nLiberia recognised th e certificates  of competenc e issued by the\
  \ Philippines  and on that basis \nissued Liberian licen ces of competenc e to seafarers\
  \ wishing to crew Liberian ships.  \n4.1.15.  In compliance with the ISM Code, CIEL\
  \ was required to have its own safety management \nsystem (the CIEL safety management\
  \ system ) to show how its function of day -to-day \nmanagement of its fleet would\
  \ ensure compliance with all the mandatory technical and \noperational requirements\
  \ of (in the Rena 's case) Liberian domestic maritime law.  This system \nwas subject\
  \ to external verification10 and both internal and external audits.  When the ISM\
  \ \nCode was adopted , some Classification Societies added external verification\
  \ and auditing of \nISM Code systems to their customer portfolio s.  The CIEL safety\
  \ management system  in this \ncase was verified and audited annually by the Classification\
  \ Society Germanischer Lloyd on \nbehalf of Liberia.  \n4.1.16.  Each ship was required\
  \ to have its own safety management system linked to the parent \nsystem of its\
  \ shore management.  Each ship system was also subjected to internal  audit  and\
  \ \nexternal verific ation  and audit .  Germ anischer Lloyd also conducted an external\
  \ pre-audit of \n                                                        \n9 Captain\
  \ AJ Swift, 1993 . \n10 Verification includes pre -audits and assessments of a new\
  \ system.  The system is later audited, once it has \nbeen operating for enough\
  \ time to build up a history that will show whether the system is functioning \n\
  properly.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 19 >>\n the Rena 's safety management\
  \ system on behalf of Liberia  in November 2010 .  The company \nconducted an internal\
  \ audit in April 2011 and Germanischer Lloyd conducted an external \naudit and verification\
  \ of the Rena 's safety management system in May 2011.  \n4.1.17.  Port s tate control\
  \  is another mechanism for checking the compliance of individual ships  with \n\
  domestic and international requirements .  Any state has the right to inspect any\
  \ ship entering \nits ports.  Ships can be detained or issued with deficiency notices.\
  \  Port state control records \nare available on a regional basis through the applicable\
  \ port state memorand um of \nunderstanding organisation s.  The memorand a are\
  \ between the maritime administrations of \nStates in the same region .  They were\
  \ formed to provide a continuous record of port state \ncontrol in spections, aimed\
  \ at minimising duplicate inspections being conducted on ships .  \nShip managers,\
  \ surveyors and auditors sometimes use t he number of deficiencies that are \nfound\
  \ and/ or the number of times a ship is detain ed as an indicator of  the general\
  \ health of a \nsafety management system .  This comes with the broad caveat that\
  \  the area s in which a ship \ntrades and the veracity of the port state control\
  \ systems of the states within those areas are \nfactor s that should be taken into\
  \ account.  \n4.1.18.  This overview describes the relationship between the international\
  \ and domestic maritime \nsystems and how they interact ed to set and monitor technical\
  \ and operational standards for \nships.  The Commission has identified safety issues\
  \ in the two sections:  \n\uF0B7 safety management systems  \n\uF0B7 training .\
  \ \nOther issues raised  \n4.1.19.  The Commission also considered two issues that\
  \ were raised by the industry during the \ninquiry:  \n\uF0B7 coastal routing for\
  \ ships  \n\uF0B7 visual aids to navigation, such as lights and beacons.  \n4.2.\
  \ Planned passage  \nSafety issue  - The standard of passage planning on board the\
  \ Rena  often , and in some respects , did \nnot comply with the company  safety\
  \ management system , or with the vessel's safety management \nsystem , or with\
  \ the STCW Convention . \n4.2.1.  The p lanning of a ship 's passage from one location\
  \ to the next is critical to the safe operation \nof the ship.  Poor planning of\
  \ the passage will increase the risk to the vessel, and therefore the \nlikelihood\
  \ of an accident .  The Commission has reviewed  all aspects of planning and  executing\
  \ \na voyage on board the Rena , and compared this with recognised  industry best\
  \ practice . \n4.2.2.  The CIEL safety management system11 guidelines on passage\
  \ planning were  extensive and \nspecifically reference d and paraphrase d the IMO\
  \ Voyage Planning Guidelines . \n4.2.3.  The CIEL safety management system  guidelines\
  \  state d the need to have the most up -to-date \ncharts and publications relevant\
  \ for the area to be navigated and for the watchkeepers to be \ngiven all information\
  \ on navigational hazards, environmental conditions and any other matter s \nthat\
  \ could affect the safety of navigation.  The largest -scale and most appropriate\
  \ chart was \nrequired to be used and the chart  was to be marked to highlight the\
  \ intended path of the ship \nand any special considerations or hazards that the\
  \ watchkeeper might encounter.  \n4.2.4.  However, t he corresponding company passage\
  \ p lanning form VS.OPS.002  (Appendix 1) was \nnot well  suited to implementing\
  \ the passage planning requirements in the CIEL safety \nmanagement system .  VS.OPS.002\
  \ had two parts . The first part was a comprehensive \nchecklist for the considerations\
  \ laid out in the guidelines .  The second part was a form to be \n            \
  \                                            \n11 Section 10.3 Passage Planning.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final report 11 -204 filled  in with the actual planned passage.\
  \  The second part did not have the capacity to cover \nall of the considerations\
  \ prompted by the checklist.   It recorded waypoint positions, and \ncourse line\
  \  and distance s between waypoints .  It also allowed for some but not all of the\
  \ other \ninformation normally seen in a good passage plan . \n4.2.5.  For example\
  \ , the form did not provide for speed alterations en -route  or under -keel clearance\
  \ s \nfor critical areas .  On the latter point, a generic single space to provide\
  \ the under -keel \nclearance for the entire voya ge was provided .  Under -keel\
  \ clearance  is a factor that should be \nconsidered for eac h leg of the voyage\
  \ , and highlighted when it becomes , or could become , a \nhazard.  \n4.2.6.  Similar\
  \ ly there was only a single space provided to record the \"squat \"12 on each page\
  \ of the \npassage plan .  Ships often transit areas of narrow and shallow water\
  \ during voyage s, not \nnecessarily only when entering and leaving port s.  It\
  \ is sometimes necessary for ships to \nreduce speed while transiting areas of shallow\
  \ water to reduce the effects of squat  in order to \nprevent the ship s running\
  \ aground.  In the passage plan  for the grounding voyage , an arbitrary \nfigure\
  \ of one metre  was recorded for squat.  There is no way of determining the location\
  \  on the \nvessel to which this refer red, or what ship's speed was used in  the\
  \ calculation .  The under -keel \nclearance was recorded as \"5 metres minimum\"\
  \ on the first page of the passage plan for the \naccident voyage, and \"2 metres\
  \ minimum\" on the second  page.  Presumably these figures \nrefer red to the departure\
  \ from Napier and  the arrival at Tauranga respectively, but this was \nnot clear\
  \  and t here was no way of knowing whether they include d an allowance for squat\
  \ or \nthe speed of the ship through the water.   The Rena 's draft and available\
  \ depth of water from \nNapier to Tauranga meant that under -keel clearance was\
  \ not a critical fac tor, provided the \nship kept to the passage plan.  Nevertheless,\
  \ t hese are all factors that should have been  \nroutinely considered  for each\
  \ leg of the voyage and the passage plan form should have been  \ndesigned to display\
  \ such information in a clear and unambiguous way.  \n4.2.7.  Environmental conditions\
  \ , such as prevailing winds, tides and currents , that can significantly \naffect\
  \ the passage of a ship should be recorded, but the passage plan ning form had no\
  \ useful \nspace to record such comments .   \n4.2.8.  In this case, for the accident\
  \ voyage t he currents were not mentioned or accounted for in the \npassage plan.\
  \  Neither the master nor the second mate said they  referenced any document \n\
  other than the nautical chart for information regarding tide and/or currents off\
  \ the east c oast \nof New Zealand .  Had they done so as part of the ir planning\
  \ the master would have been \nbetter informed of the  unfavourable currents for\
  \ a good part of the passage to Tauranga.  A \ncalculation taking account of the\
  \ current s would have shown  that his exp ectation of reach ing \nthe pilot boarding\
  \ ground  at 0300, before the end of his chosen tidal window , was unrealistic.\
  \  \n4.2.9.  According to the Rena 's charterer  there was no pressure for the master\
  \ to make the early -\nmorning tide , and the master confirmed this .  The  Rena\
  \ 's charterer  simply needed to know the \ntidal window  in which  the ship would\
  \ arrive so that it could pre -order labour to work the cargo.  \nThe pressure the\
  \ master put on himself and the bridge watchkeepers to achieve the \nunrealistic\
  \ arrival time was a consequence of miscalculating how long the passage would \n\
  take, and thus miscalculating the time of arrival .  The pressure to achieve this\
  \ unrealistic \narrival time  was ultimately what led to the series of ill -thought\
  \ -out deviations from the passage \nplan, the last of which directly contributed\
  \ to the grounding . \n4.2.10.  Areas of danger to navigation should be highlighted\
  \ on the chart as part of planning the \npassage. Not all areas of danger to navigation\
  \ we re highlighted on the chart, including \nAstrolabe Reef.   In this case , however,\
  \ highlighting the reef on the chart may not have averted \nthe grounding.  The\
  \ second  mate was aware of its existence13 and the master did not refer to \n \
  \                                                       \n12 The phenomenon where\
  \ a ship sinks bodily in the water when travelling at speed.  The effect can be\
  \ \nenhanced when the distance between the keel and the seabed is small.  \n13 The\
  \ second mate placed a mark on the chart one nauti cal mile north of Astrolabe Reef\
  \ when planning for \nthe final shortcut.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page\
  \ 21 >>\n the chart anyway before takin g over control of the ship .  Nevertheless,\
  \ it is recommended best \nindustry practice and should have been adhered to.  \n\
  4.2.11.  The largest -scale chart should be used wherever possible.  A larger -scale\
  \ chart was available \n(Chart NZ5413: Approaches to Tauranga) for th e area covering\
  \ the approach to Tauranga .  \nThis chart was not on board the Rena  and it was\
  \ not listed on the passage plan form.  The \nchart would have been the next chart\
  \ that should have been available to use  if the Rena  had \nnot grounded . \nOther\
  \ voyages of the Rena  \n4.2.12.  Given these shortcomings, t he Commission looked\
  \ at whether the deficiencies on this \naccident voyage were evident in any other\
  \ voyages of the Rena , and whether the safe ship \nmanagement system relevant to\
  \ the operation of the Rena  had systemic shortcomings.  \n4.2.13.  Maritime New\
  \ Zealand engaged a team of expert navigators  (through The Nautical Institute in\
  \ \nAuckland)  to reconstruct 30 of the Rena 's past voyages, as near as practicable\
  \ using passage \nplans, charts and log book records from the  ship.  The Commission\
  \ obtained the results of this \nwork.  The Commission then conducted its own reconstructions\
  \ by using raw data to plot the \nvoyages and to verify the plotting undertaken\
  \ by the expert navigators. The same master and \nsecond mate who were on board\
  \ during the accident voyage were on board for most of the \nvoyages that were re\
  \ -constructed.  The Commission also obtained the original charts from the \nRena\
  \  that covered  the six most recent coastal voyages of the Rena  (in the eight\
  \ days leading \nup to  and including the accident voyage).  The record of these\
  \ six voyages had not been \nerased from the charts.  These charts and the reconstructed\
  \ voyages were used to analyse the \nsafety management system on board the Rena\
  \  with respect to voyage planning and voyage \nexecution . \n4.2.14.  The Commission\
  \ verified the accuracy of the voyage reconstructions and used this information\
  \ \nto help understand the quality of passage planning and navigation by the bridge\
  \ team  during \nthose voyages , in comparison with the standards noted  on the\
  \ accident voyage.   The charts for \nthe previous five voyages into and between\
  \ New Zealand ports before the Rena  departed \nNapier were recovered from the ship.\
  \  The markings on these charts had not been erased.  \nConsequently it was not\
  \ necessary to reconstruct those voyages in the manner described \nabove.  For the\
  \ earlier voyages, there was insufficient information to  reconstruct each voyage\
  \ \nwith total accuracy.  For example, not all position fixes the crew might have\
  \ marked on the \nchart could be recalled - only those that were recorded in the\
  \ log book (usually GPS \npositions) .  Also, there may have been valid reasons\
  \ f or deviating from a passage plan, such \nas manoeuvring for the avoidance  of\
  \ other traffic as required by the intern ational collision \nregulations.  \n4.2.15.\
  \  Notwithstanding these caveats, f or most of the reconstructed  voyages there\
  \ were some \naspects of the planning an d execution that did not  meet the industry\
  \ best practices required \nby the safety management system  on board the  Rena\
  \ .  Examples of some of the deficiencies \nwere:  \n\uF0B7 incorrect chart identification\
  \ numbers  \n\uF0B7 inappropriate charts listed, or required charts not listed \
  \ \n\uF0B7 some nautical publications were identified, but no information from them\
  \ brought into \nthe passage planning form  \n\uF0B7 sometimes magnitude s of squat\
  \  and under -keel clearance were given, but there was \nno record of how the se\
  \ had been  calculated , or to which leg of the voyage they had \nbeen  applicable\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the p osition fixing frequency was often only hourly , and often without\
  \ regard to  the \nvessel 's location  or proximity to navigational hazards  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the master did not always sign the passage plan  (although t he passage plan for\
  \ the \naccident voyage was signed  by the master ). \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final report\
  \ 11 -204 4.2.16.  Some of these examples were  minor or typographical in nature\
  \ .  Others were more serious.  \nCIEL said in its submission that none of these\
  \ examples directly contributed to the grounding  \nand t he Commission agrees.\
  \  As mentioned in the caveat above, there could in some cases be \nreasonable explanation\
  \ s for act s or omission s.  However, the repetitive nature of the acts and \n\
  omissions  from one voyage to the next , and the fact that similar issues wer e\
  \ evident for the \nmost recent  six coastal voyages (including the accident voyage\
  \ ), indicate that the failures in \nthe design and execut ion of the passage plan\
  \ that le d to the grounding were not one -off \nfailures, but indicative of a wider\
  \ systemic safety iss ue.   \nDeviation from planned passage  \nSafety issue  -\
  \ The Rena  crew occasionally deviated from the passage plan  in an ad -hoc manner\
  \ and \ndid not always incorporate those deviations into the plan  - nor did they\
  \ adequately monitor the ship 's \nprogress against the deviation s.  Deviating\
  \ from the passage plan was one factor directly contributing \nto the grounding.\
  \  \n4.2.17.  The reconstruction of these other voyages showed occasional  deviations\
  \ from the passage \nplans, sometimes to shorten the distance s travelled  and at\
  \ other times possibly for legitimate \nreasons .  It also showed that it was routine\
  \ for watchkeepers to fix the ship 's position hourly \nand us e GPS only , when\
  \  the passage plan s required that position fixes be made using GPS \nand radar,\
  \ and the master's standing orders stated that  \"in coastal waters [the watchkeeper]\
  \  \nshould take fixes on a paper chart at frequent intervals of 10 -15 minutes\
  \ using more than one \nmethod\".   The master's standing orders for his watchkeepers\
  \ , therefore, were not consistent \nwith the passage plan that the master [ usually\
  \ ] signed as approved.   \n4.2.18.  The passage plans did not always conform with\
  \ the company's safety management system, \nand the watchkeepers did not always\
  \ follow the passage plan s anyway.  The passage plan fo r \nthe accident voyage\
  \ was one such example , as was the act of de viating from it . \n4.2.19.  On the\
  \ accident voyage the master altered the passage plan marked on the chart in order\
  \ to \nsave time rounding Mahia Peninsula.  He then told the second mate to take\
  \ the Rena  closer \ninshore of the new line he had marked on the chart.  The master\
  \ also told the second mate to \ntake the ship  either side of the planned passage\
  \ marked on the chart while trave lling up the \neast coast in search of the least\
  \ unfavourable current.  In doi ng so the master effectively gave \nthe second \
  \ mate approval  to deviate as far from the planned course as he felt he needed\
  \ to.  \n4.2.20.  The vessel's original planned passage marked on the chart would\
  \ have taken the Rena  two \nnautical miles to the north of Astrolabe R eef before\
  \ approaching the pilot station.  The pilot \nwindow cut -off was 0300 and the Rena\
  \  was running close to that cut -off. When allowing for a \ncontrolled slowing\
  \ of the ship to a speed at which the pilot could be boarded, they were not \ngoing\
  \ to achieve t he window.  The second mate decided to shorten the distance to the\
  \ pilot \nstation by moving the course line  alteration point closer to Astrolabe\
  \ Reef .  This deviation \nwould have saved about one minute14.  His decision to\
  \ do so was based on pressure he felt to \nreach the pilot station by 0300.   \n\
  4.2.21.  There is nothing wrong in principle with deviating from the voyage plan\
  \ in response  to changes \nin weather or after encoun tering a situation that has\
  \ not been planned  for. \n4.2.22.  The IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines recommend\
  \ that \"a ny changes made to the plan should \nbe made consistent with these guidelines\
  \ and be clearly marked and recorded \".  They also \nrecommend that  if a decision\
  \ is made during a voyage, or it is \"necessary for the ship to \ndeviate substantially\
  \ from the planned route for other reasons, then an amended route shall \nbe planned\
  \ prior to deviating substantially from the route originally planned\"15. \n4.2.23.\
  \   The ap propriate procedures for any course change would have included the following\
  \ steps : \n                                                        \n14 The second\
  \ mate was heard on the bridge voice recorder repeatedly calculating the time and\
  \ distance to \ngo to reach the pilot station by 0300.  \n15 STCW Convention   A-VIII/2\

  \ 1. Plot the new position for the course line  alteration point north of Astrolabe\
  \ Reef  \n2. Plot the vessel's  position  \n3. Draw a new line to the new course\
  \ line  alteration point  north of Astrolabe Reef  \n4. Make the alteration o f\
  \ gyro heading  and closely monitor  the s hip's progress  along \nthat track .\
  \  The ship 's progress should have been monitored more closely than \nbefore  the\
  \ deviation from the passage plan,  given the higher risk created  by the new \n\
  track . \n4.2.24.  The second  mate did none of the above.  T he alteration to the\
  \ gyro heading  was not a single \nchange to the vessel 's heading but rather a\
  \ progressive change over about 30 minutes.  The \ntrue course between the pin-prick\
  \  he made on the chart  and the new intended alteration point \none nautical mile\
  \ north of the reef was about 260 degrees.  \n4.2.25.  The incremental alteration\
  \ to the gyro heading  suggest s that the second mate had not fully \nconsidered\
  \ what the new gyro heading  would be.  While altering the vessel 's heading (set\
  \ by \nthe automatic pilot) the second mate  went 5 degrees past the 260 -degree\
  \ required track and \nhe did not account for set, leeway or gyrocompass error.\
  \  The deviation was done in an ad -hoc \nmanner and no consideration was given\
  \ as to ho w the Rena 's progress would be measured \nagainst the amended plan.\
  \  Once the vessel's heading had stabilised on about 2 55 degrees at \nabout 0150\
  \ the Rena  was heading for a collision with Astrolabe Reef, and the crew were not\
  \ \naware of the imminent danger.  \nFindings:  \n1. The Rena  grounding was not\
  \ in any way attributable to the malfunction of any \non-board machinery or equipment,\
  \ including on -board navigational equipment.  \n2. The Rena 's passage plan from\
  \ Napier to Tauranga on the accident voyage did \nnot meet the stand ards documented\
  \ in the CIEL safety management system  or \nthe IMO Voyage Planning  Guidelines\
  \ .  Nor did it meet best industry practice as \ndocumented in  The Nautical Institute\
  \ 's Bridge Team Management - A Practical \nGuide . \n3. The second  mate deviated\
  \ from the pass age plan to take the Rena  closer to \nAstrolabe Reef to save time.\
  \  The deviation unnecessarily increased the risk of \nthe ship running aground\
  \  and directly contributed to the grounding.  \n4. The Rena  grounded on Astrolabe\
  \ Reef because the bridge crew progressivel y \nadjusted the automatic pilot to\
  \ an incorrect heading and without making \nallowance for any leeway, set or gyrocompass\
  \ error.  The resultant ground track \ntook the ship directly over the reef.   Not\
  \ monitoring the progress of the ship \nagainst the deviation contributed directly\
  \ to the grounding.  \n5. The failure of the crew to follow industry best practice\
  \ guidelines  for making and \nexecuting the passage plan on the accident voyage\
  \  was not an isolated case .  A \nreview of previous voyage plans revealed a number\
  \ of acts and omissions similar \nto those made on the accident voyage.  \n \n \
  \ \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.3. Watchkeeping standards  \nSafety\
  \ issue  - The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena  for the accident voyage\
  \ and \nparticularly the watch period during which  the grounding  occurred , in\
  \ almost all  respects , did not \ncomply with the industry best practice described\
  \ in the IMO Voyage Planning G uidelines  and The \nNautical Institute 's Bridge\
  \ Team Management - a Practical Guide . \n4.3.1.  The master and the watchkeepers\
  \ had the prime responsibility for navigating the ship from \none point to the next\
  \ in accordance with the passage plan.  The previous section discusse d \nthe passage\
  \ plan and how in this case it was flawed  in several ways and was not adhered to\
  \ .  \nHowever, the se factor s alone need not have resulted in the Rena  running\
  \ aground.  \n4.3.2.  If the watchk eeping on the bridge that night had  met the\
  \ required standards  and followed \nindustry best practice , the ground ing would\
  \ probably  not have occurred .  The Rena  would \nprobably  have passed  one mile\
  \ north of Astrolabe Reef as the second  mate intended.  The \nfollowing section\
  \ discuss es how that went wrong.  \nMonitoring the ship's progress  \nSafety issue\
  \  - The crew were not adequately monitoring and fixing the Rena 's position as\
  \ the ship \napproached Astrolabe Reef and the port of Tauranga.  \n4.3.3.  It is\
  \ important that a watchkeeper be fully aware of where a ship is at all times, and\
  \ be (for \nexample)  fully aware of all factors that affect the ship's progress\
  \ , or are likely to in the \nimmediate  future.  Knowing about e nvironmental factors\
  \ such as wind, sea, current and tide  is \nimportant - so too is knowing the status\
  \ of the navigation equipment used to d irect and \nmonitor the progress  of the\
  \ ship.  This is often  referred to as the watchkeeper maintaining \n\"situational\
  \ awareness \". \n4.3.4.  Some factors such as current and tide can be predicted\
  \ and countermeasures taken to offset \ntheir estimated effect s. Frequently plotting\
  \  and monitor ing of a ship's position is k ey to \nknowing the resultant effect\
  \ of all these factors on the ship's progress.  The closer the ship is \nto navigational\
  \ hazards, the more often the ship's position should  be checked.   It might be\
  \ \nreasonable to  plot the ship's position hourly when crossing an ocean (deep\
  \ sea) because the \nship deviating off the track is not immediately critical. \
  \ When navigating a narrow channel, the \nship's position should be monitored continuously,\
  \ because the slightest deviatio n can result in \nits grounding.  When navigating\
  \ a coast, the frequency of position  fixing should be somewhere \nin between, depending\
  \ on the closeness of  the intended track  to navigational hazards.   This \npractice\
  \  was reflected in the Rena  master 's standing orders , in the IMO Voyage Planning\
  \ \nGuidelines , and in the safety management system  on board the  Rena . \n4.3.5.\
  \  The STCW Convention requires that the situation be fully appraised to manage\
  \ the \"risk of \ncollision, stranding and other dangers to navigation \"16.  In\
  \ particular, the STCW Convention \nstates  that17: \n\uF0B7 during the watch, the\
  \ gyro heading  steered, position and speed shall be checked at \nsufficiently frequent\
  \ intervals, using any available navigational aids necessary, to \nensure that the\
  \ ship follows the planned course  \n\uF0B7 the officer in charge of the navigational\
  \ watch shall have full knowledge of the location \nand operation of all safety\
  \ and navigational equipment on board the ship and shall be \naware and take account\
  \ of the operating limitations of such equipment  \n\uF0B7 officers of the navigational\
  \ watch shall make the most effective use of all navigati onal \nequipment at their\
  \ disposal.  \n                                                        \n16 STCW\
  \  Convention A-VIII/3 .  \n17 STCW  Convention A-VIII/3 Performing the navigational\
  \ watch . \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 25 >>\n 4.3.6.  The IMO Voyage Planning\
  \ Guidelines recommend that  \"the progress of the vessel in \naccordance with the\
  \ voyage and passage plan should be closely and continuously \nmonitored\"18. \n\
  4.3.7.  The CIEL safety management system  guidelines state that , \"when the vessel\
  \ is navigating in \ncoastal waters the primary responsibility of the [watchkeeper]\
  \ is to ensure that the ship is \nfollowing the predetermined passage plan by fixing\
  \ the position of the vessel and whenever \ncircumstances permit, he must use more\
  \ than one fixing method, such as three bearing lines, \nradar ranges/bearings and\
  \ instant readout s of one of the electronic position system s e.g. \nLORAN, GPS\"\
  19. \n4.3.8.  However,  despite the various guidelines and  company  instructions\
  \ to the contrary,  it had \nbecome routine on board the Rena  for the position\
  \ to be , in the most part , fixed only hourly , \nand usually on the hour , as\
  \ shown by the reconstruction of previous  voyages.  The coastal \npassage from\
  \ Napier to Tauranga  on the accident voyage  was no different  up to the point\
  \ \nwhere the second  mate ad justed the course to cut the corner north of Astrolab\
  \ e Reef .  Except \nfor one position fix , GPS was the only method used to fi x\
  \ the Rena 's position .  \n4.3.9.  On the morning of the grounding t he position\
  \ was fixed hourly until the watchkeeping able -\nbodied seaman placed a GPS fix\
  \ on the chart at about 0120, before the deviation from the \nplanned passage; then\
  \ again at about 0142.  When the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  \nentered the\
  \ chartroom to do the hourly position fix at 0200 , the master and the second mate\
  \ \nwere standing in front of the chart.  The watchkeeping able -bodied seaman \
  \ could not access \nthe chart and would not interrupt the master or second mate\
  \ , so this position was never \nplotted on  the chart.  Had the position been \
  \ plotted , it would have shown that the Rena  was \ntracking toward Astrolabe Reef,\
  \ and the grounding may have been averted . \n4.3.10.  The watchkeeping able -bodied\
  \ seaman  was the designated \"look -out\" and should not \ntherefore have been\
  \ engaged in any other tasks that could affect his ability to keep a good \nlook-out.\
  \  The STCW Convention says, \"the look -out must be able to give full attention\
  \ to the \nkeeping of a proper look -out and no other duties shall be undertaken\
  \ or assigned which could \ninterfere with that task\"20. It is not necessarily\
  \ unsafe for the look-out to be assigned to other \ntasks if the responsibility\
  \ of look-out is taken over by someone else.  However, i n this case \nthere was\
  \ no -one acting as look-out while the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  made the\
  \ \nposition fix.  \n4.3.11.  Given that Astrolab e Reef was submerged and unlit\
  \ , this deficiency did not in itself have a \ncausative influence on the grounding.\
  \  The deficiency did , however , reflect the general \nsystemic failures on the\
  \ vessel . \nUsing bridge equipment effectively  \nSafety issue  - The watchkeeper\
  \ was not making the most effect ive use of the bridge navigation \nequipment on\
  \ board the Rena  before the grounding.  \n4.3.12.  The STCW Convention says that\
  \ , \"officers of the navigational watch shall make the most \neffective use of\
  \ all navigational equipment at their disposal\"21.  The STCW Convention \nstandard\
  \ was reiterated in the master's standing orders, which said , \"All bridge equipment\
  \ [is] \nalways at your disposal and must be used to their optimum, as per makers\
  \ instructions for \nuse\" . \n4.3.13.  The Rena 's radar had automatic radar plotting\
  \ aid capability  and a  feature that enabled maps \nand the location s of hazards\
  \ to navigation to be programmed into the radar.  This feature was \n          \
  \                                              \n18 IMO Resolution A.893(21) Guidelines\

  \ not used by the Rena 's crew on the accident voyage.  Any such features programmed\
  \ into the \nradar would  have  show ed on the radar screen.  It would have been\
  \ a simple task to  program \nthe position of Astrolabe Reef into the radar.  This\
  \ action would almost certainly have \nprevented the grounding because the radar\
  \ was the first equipment that the master used \nwhen he took control of the bridge.\
  \  Astrolabe Reef would have been clear ly shown on the \nradar as being directly\
  \ ahead of the ship.  \n4.3.14.  Parallel indexing is another effective use of the\
  \ radar to monitor continuously the progress of a \nship in relation to a known\
  \ hazard .  The second mate set up parallel indexing on the radar .  \nHowev er,\
  \ the settings were continuously adjusted during  the several minutes that it was\
  \ in \noperation.  The voice recording from the voyage data recorder suggest ed\
  \ that  the second mate \nwas demonstrating to the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman\
  \  how parallel indexin g worked,  \nrather than actually  using the parallel indexing\
  \ to monitor  the Rena 's progress against the  \nintended course .  Had the second\
  \ mate used the parallel index to monitor the Rena 's progress  \nagainst the intended\
  \ course after he deviated from the passage plan towards Astrolabe Reef, \nit would\
  \ have shown him that the Rena  was drifting toward s Astrolabe Reef under the \n\
  influences of leeway, set, tide and any compass error.  \n4.3.15.  Finally, the\
  \ second  radar was not switched on.   There are two reasons for it being  good\
  \ \npractice to have both radars switched on when approaching a port .  First, it\
  \ is a time when two \npeople are involved in navigating the ship - one controlling\
  \ and the other monitoring.  The \nsecond reason is that the radars work on different\
  \ bandwidths (frequenc ies), and therefore \nbetween the two radars there is an\
  \ increased chance of detecting a faint target , such as \nAstrolabe Reef just on\
  \ the sea surface.  \nMonitoring compass error  \nSafety issue  - The compass error\
  \ was infrequently checked and was not checked at all on the voyage \nfrom Napier\
  \ to Tauranga.  \n4.3.16.  A ship's compasses are princip al pieces of navigational\
  \ equipment and they have an inherent  \nmargin of error.   Knowing the error in\
  \ each  is critical to safe navigation, particularly when \nnavigating close to\
  \ hazards and in narrow channels.  \n4.3.17.  The STCW  Convention  says that the\
  \ \"standard compass error is to be determined at least once \na watch [ six times\
  \ daily]  and when possible, after any major alteration of gyro heading ; the \n\
  standard and gyro -compasses are to be frequently compared and repeaters are to\
  \ be \nsynchronized with their master compass \"22. It will not always be possible\
  \ or practicable to \nachieve these standards and they were developed for  when\
  \ ships had a greater reliance on \nthe magnetic compass as opposed to the gyrocompass\
  \ .  Nevertheless, the conditions on the \nvoyage from Napier to Tauranga did allow\
  \ compass errors to be obtained.  It would appear \nfrom the data analysed that\
  \ the consiste nt drift southward of the gyro course being steered, \ntoward Astrolabe\
  \ Reef , was in part attributable to gyrocompass error.  \n4.3.18.  The log book\
  \ and compass error book show ed that the compass error on  board the Rena  was\
  \ \nusually determined fewer  than four times a day, and often only once or twice.\
  \ The compass \nerror was not checked at all  during the passage from Napier to\
  \ Tauranga.   It is important to \nknow the gyrocompass error , because it is the\
  \ gyrocompass that the automatic pilot uses to \ncontrol the heading of th e ship.\
  \  \n  \n                                                        \n22 STCW  Convention\

  \ -204 \n<< Page 27 >>\n Taking control of the ship  \nSafety issue  - There was\
  \ no clear delineation of who had control of the Rena  at the time of the \ngrounding,\
  \ and the master, having assumed that he had taken control, had received virtually\
  \ no \ninformation on where the ship was , where it was heading and what immediate\
  \ dangers to navigation he \nneeded to consider.  \n4.3.19.  Handing over the watc\
  \ h between watchkeepers, and to and from the master , is a very \nimportant process.\
  \  The importance of the master (in this case) being totally aware of the \nsituation\
  \ cannot be overstated .  As with all other aspects of watchkeeping, this was well\
  \ \ncovered in th e STCW Convention  and the CIEL safety management system  procedures.\
  \  \n4.3.20.  The STCW Convention states , \"Prior to taking over the watch, relieving\
  \ officers [in this case the \nmaster] shall satisfy themselves as to the ship 's\
  \ estimated or true position and confirm its \nintended track, [gyro heading]  and\
  \ speed, and [engine] controls as appropriate and shall note \nany dangers to navigation\
  \ expected to be encountered during their watch \"23. \n4.3.21.  The STCW Convention\
  \  goes further in saying  (in part) , \"Relieving officers shall personally \n\
  satisfy themselves regarding the:  \n\uF0B7 standing orders and other special instructions\
  \ of the master relating to navigation \nof the ship;  \n\uF0B7 position, gyro heading\
  \ , speed and dra ft of the ship;  \n\uF0B7 prevailing and predicted tides, currents,\
  \ weather, visibility and the effect of these \nfactors upon [ground track]  and\
  \ speed;  \n\uF0B7 navigational situatio n, including but not limited to: the operational\
  \ condition of all \nnavigational and safety equipment being used  or lik ely to\
  \ be used during the watch; \nthe errors of gyro - and magnetic compasses; and the\
  \ conditions and hazards likely \nto be encountered during the watch \". \n4.3.22.\
  \  The master arrived on the bridge at about 0152, which was 22 minutes before the\
  \ Rena  \nstruck Astro labe Reef.  He had a discussion over the radar screen  with\
  \ the second mate.  The ir \ndiscussion was about  whether they were going to be\
  \ in time to pick up the pilot, and preparing \nthe ship for arrival at the pilot\
  \ station.   They did not discuss the Rena 's po sition, the deviation \nfrom the\
  \ course line or the location of Astrolabe Reef .  Nor did  the master study the\
  \ chart.  \n4.3.23.  The master gave the second  mate the task of preparing pre\
  \ -arrival documentation and then  \nbegan  control ling the ship.  The second mate\
  \ assumed  that the master had taken control, \nthen worked in the chartroom preparing\
  \ the documentation.  \n4.3.24.  The master later said that he had had confidence\
  \ in the second  mate's watchkeeping  ability, \nand had assumed that the ship was\
  \ in a safe position.  The radar navig ation system was \nchanged to monitor  the\
  \ pilot station arrival navigation waypoint  when neither the second  mate \nnor\
  \ the master was aware that Astrolabe Reef lay between the Rena  and that destination.\
  \  \nThis non -adherence to standard practice for handing over  the watch (or conduct\
  \ of the ship) \nwas the last active failure that contributed to the grounding.\
  \  It was the last opportunity for \nrealising the peril the ship was in.  \n4.3.25.\
  \  The master acknowledged that he had (in his own mind) taken control of the ship\
  \ when he set \nthe second  mate another task.  He also said that he  had assumed\
  \ the second  mate would \ncontinue to monitor the progress of the ship.  It is\
  \ difficult to understand h ow the second  mate \ncould have monitored progress\
  \  when he had just been given another task that would require \nhis full attention.\

  \ A -VIII/3 Taking over the watch.  \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.3.26.\
  \  On this issue the STCW Convention says, \"the officer in charge of the navigational\
  \ watch shall \ncontinue to be responsible fo r the safe navigation of the ship,\
  \ despite the presence of the \nmaster on the bridge, until informed specifically\
  \ that the master has assumed that \nresponsibility and this is mutually understood\"\
  24. \n4.3.27.  On this issue the CIEL policy says , \"Even if the master is present\
  \ [on the bridge], continue \nbeing responsible for the safe navigation of the vessel\
  \ until such time as the master expressly \ninforms [the watchkeeper] that he takes\
  \ the [control]  of the vessel\"25. \n4.3.28.  Although there was no formal wa tch\
  \ handover it was assumed by both the master and the \nsecond mate that the master\
  \ was in control of the vessel, even though the master did not \nexpressly say so.\
  \  There should have been a formal verbal exchange between the master and \nthe\
  \ second  mate acknow ledging that the master had taken control (and responsibility)\
  \ for the \nnavigation of the ship.  If the master had acknowledged that responsibility\
  \ it may have \nprompted him to seek more information before taking control of the\
  \ vessel.  \nFindings:  \n6. The standard  of watchkeeping on board the Rena  for\
  \ the  accident voyage, and \nparticularly for the watch  period during which  the\
  \ grounding  occurred , in almost \nall respects did not comply with the requirements\
  \ of  the STCW Convention , the \nIMO Voyage Planning Guidelines, the CIEL safety\
  \ management system  or \nindustry best practice described in The Nautical Institute\
  \ 's Bridge Team \nManagement  - a Practical Guide.   \n7. The Rena 's crew were\
  \ not following company procedures with respect to  \nmonitoring the progress of\
  \ the ship in rela tion to known dangers to navigation for \nthe entire voyage from\
  \ Napier to the time of the grounding.  A failure to monitor \nadequately the progress\
  \ of the Rena  contributed directly to the grounding.  \n8. The second  mate was\
  \ not making the most effect ive use of th e bridge navigation \nequipment on board\
  \ the Rena  before the grounding - had he done so either  he \nor the master would\
  \ have been alerted to the presence of Astrolabe Reef in time \nto avert the grounding.\
  \  \n9. The master assumed control of the Rena  when the ship was  tracking directly\
  \ for \nAstrolabe Reef.  There was no clear delineation of who had control of the\
  \ Rena  \nat the time of the grounding, and the master, having assumed that he had\
  \ taken \ncontrol, had received virtually no information on where the ship was ,\
  \ where  it \nwas heading , and what immediate dangers to navigation he needed to\
  \ consider.  \n \n  \n                                                        \n\

  \ \npart).  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 29 >>\n 4.4. Fatigue  \n4.4.1.\
  \  Fatigue in maritime operations is a safety issue that the IMO has been addressing\
  \ through its \nvarious instruments for many years.  The Rena  had called at five\
  \ New Zealand ports in six \ndays.  The grounding occurred at 0214 on the eighth\
  \ day.  These circumstances prompted the \nCommission to consider whether fatigue\
  \ could have been a factor contributing to the \ngrounding.   \nSafety issue  -\
  \ The perfo rmance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been\
  \ at \nleast mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight to 0215,\
  \ the period leading up to the \ngrounding.  \n4.4.2.  The STCW Convention A -VIII/1\
  \ Fitness for duty requires that all perso ns who are assigned duty \nas officers\
  \ in charge of a watch, or as ratings forming part of a watch, shall be provided\
  \ with a \nrest period of not less than 10 hours in any 24 -hour period, and 77\
  \ hours in any seven -day \nperiod.  \n4.4.3.  The hours of rest may be divided\
  \ i nto no more than two periods, of which one shall be at least \nsix hours in\
  \ length, and the intervals between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed\
  \ 14 \nhours.  \n4.4.4.  The hours of rest must be recorded in a standardised format\
  \ to allow monitoring and \nverificat ion of compliance with the provisions of the\
  \ STCW Convention A -VIII/1 Fitness for duty.  \n4.4.5.  The Rena 's master was\
  \ not a designated watchkeeper.  The officer -of-the-watch function was \nshared\
  \ by the first, second and third mates.  A review of the second mate's n ormal \n\
  watchkeeping schedule and his actual hours of work in the 72 hours prior to the\
  \ grounding \nshowed that his work/rest routine was compliant with the STCW Convention.\
  \  \n4.4.6.  The hours of rest for the crew of the Rena  were analysed by an expert\
  \ in fatigue, sleep and \nhuman cognitive performance (Professor Gander) using the\
  \ recorded hours of rest as the \nprimary source of data.  The recorded hours of\
  \ rest data was supplemented with post -accident \ncrew interviews and a revi ew\
  \ of other verifying records.  \n4.4.7.  Professor Gander's analysis was limited\
  \ by the data available, and there was some uncertainty \nin that data.  There were\
  \ some inconsistencies between the recorded hours of rest and the \nknown and/or\
  \ claimed actions of the crew  or vessel.  For example , the recorded hours of rest\
  \ \nindicate d that on the day of the grounding the master was awake from midnight\
  \ until the \ngrounding, although during interviews the master claimed to have been\
  \ awoken by the \ntelephone call from the bridge at about 0135.  \n4.4.8.  The Commission\
  \ also engaged the ATSB to provide a human factors report, commenting on \nwhet\
  \ her fatigue could have been  a factor contributing to the grounding . \n4.4.9.\
  \  The ATSB report made the following statement on the limitations of its analysis:\
  \  \n\"Evaluation of fatigue requires consideration of many factors.  Hours of sleep\
  \ is a \nprimary determinant, as is time of day of both sleep and work.  These factors\
  \ were \nconsidered in this analysis.  However, limited data was available regarding:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 quality of s leep \n\uF0B7 workload and/or sustained attention  \n\uF0B7\
  \ level of adaptation to split -schedule rosters and length of time on the current\
  \ \nschedule  \n\uF0B7 use of fatigue countermeasures  \n\uF0B7 subjective alertness\
  \ levels  \n\uF0B7 sleep disorders  \n\uF0B7 other physiological factors such as\
  \ nutrition, gene ral health, use of caffeine or \nother stimulants, etc  \n\n<<\
  \ Page 30 >>\n Final report 11 -204 This analysis considered the potential for fatigue\
  \ impairment. It did not consider \nwhether fatigue contributed to any event or\
  \ actions.  Such an analysis would require \nconsideration of factors such as er\
  \ ror types and their established association with \nfatigued performance, and the\
  \ extent to which there are alternative explanations for \nthe actions.  It also\
  \ must be noted that the effect of restricted sleep on performance \nis highly individualised,\
  \ meaning t hat modelling outcomes will never represent a \nperfect fit for any\
  \ one person.  \nFurther, noting that the unique requirements of merchant shipping\
  \ operations \nfrequently require changes to planned work and sleep schedules, the\
  \ assumptions \nof consistent sleep and work patterns built into this analysis are\
  \ likely to represent a \nmore favou rable outcome than was the case. \" \n4.4.10.\
  \  Four questions to decide whether fatigue was a contributing factor to the grounding\
  \  were  \nconsidered .  The questions were as follows:  \nAt what time did the\
  \ grounding take place?   \nThe grounding occurred at about 0214.  Profes sor Gander\
  \ said that at this time in the body \nclock circadian cycle , \"the functional\
  \ capacity of the crew would be expected to be close to \nits daily minimum and\
  \ physiological sleepiness close to its daily maximum\" .  The ATSB \nreport noted\
  \  that the time the grounding occurred was \"highlighted as a risk factor\" when\
  \ \nusing the biomathematical fatigue prediction software , Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling\
  \ Tool \n(FAST)26. \nWas the crew's normal circadian rhythm disrupted?   \nAlthough\
  \ the master was not schedu led to work nights, the master had been on duty for\
  \ \neach of the three preceding nights.  Professor Gander said , \"\u2026 it is\
  \ reasonable to conclude \nthat his normal circadian rhythm was disrupted.\" Professor\
  \ Gander also said that the \nsecond mate's duty period \" required displacing his\
  \ sleep from the optimal time in the \ncircadian body clock cycle, thus it is reasonable\
  \ to conclude that his normal circadian \nrhythm was disrupted\" . \nHowever, the\
  \ ATSB  noted that \"a key consideration of fatigue assessments is the extent  to\
  \ \nwhich a person has been able to adapt to a specific schedule. It would appear\
  \ that the master \nhad no fixed schedule, making the extent of adaptation difficult\
  \ to assess.   However, it is \npossible that some level of adaptation could occur\
  \ to a split -shift schedule that could give less \nadverse results\" . \nFor the\
  \ second mate, the ATSB added, \"the time -of-day factor result must be interpreted\
  \ \ncautiously as it does not account for the second mate's adaptation to this night\
  \ time watch, \nwhich will be determined by the length of time he had been operating\
  \ on this schedule, \namongst other individual factors\" . \nFor h ow many hours\
  \ had the crew been awake at the time of the grounding?   \nThe master was asleep\
  \ in his cabin until the second mate telephoned him at about 0135 , \nand at the\
  \ time of the grounding he had been awake for about 38 minutes.  Professor \nGander\
  \ said that \"extended wakefulness was thus not a factor\" . However, immediately\
  \ \nafter being awoken from sleep a person will have a transitional period of reduced\
  \ task  \nperformance.  This condition is known as sleep inertia.  Professor Gander\
  \ said that the \nmaster \"could have been experiencing cognitive impairment associated\
  \ with sleep inertia \n                                                        \n\
  26 FAST is underpinned by the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue and Task Effectiveness model,\
  \ which asserts that (a) a \ncircadian process infl uences both performance and\
  \ sleep regulation, and (b) sleep regulation is dependent \non hours of sleep, hours\
  \ of wakefulness, current sleep debt, the circadian process and fragmentation \n\
  (awakenings during a period of sleep).  The ATSB preferred the FAST mod el over\
  \ the Prior -Sleep -Wake model \nas it took consideration of time of day and sleep\
  \ quality effects.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 31 >>\n when he initially\
  \ responded to the telephone call from the bridge.  Sleep inert ia effects \nwould\
  \ be expected to have dissipated by the time of the grounding\" . The second mate\
  \ had \nbeen awake for a little over two hours at the time of the grounding, so\
  \ Professor Gander \nsaid extended wakefulness was not a factor.  \nIn respect of\
  \ sleep ine rtia, the ATSB report commented , \"the severity of sleep inertia can\
  \ \nbe influenced by the duration of the prior sleep, but more significantly by\
  \ the sleep stage \nprior to awakening.  If woken from slow -wave sleep, sleep inertia\
  \ will be more severe than if \nwoken from stage 1 or 2 sleep  (Tassi P. &., 2000)\
  \ .  To that extent, if an individual is \ncarrying a sleep debt, and is therefore\
  \ more likely to be in a deep (slow -wave) sleep, there \nis an increased risk for\
  \ sleep inertia upon wakening\".  \nThe ATSB report commented further, \"severity\
  \ of sleep inertia effect s have also been \nshown to be related to time of day\
  \ of awakening.  That is, if woken during the period of the \ncircadian trough (approximately\
  \ 0200 to 0600), the effects of sleep inertia may be more \nsevere.  Further, sleep\
  \ inertia has been found to last fro m as little as 1 minute, to up to 4 \nhours.\
  \  In the absence of major sleep deprivation however, sleep inertia effects rarely\
  \ \nexceed 30 minutes  (Tassi, P., Muzet, A, 2000) .  Without access to information\
  \ regarding \nthe quality of the master's preceding sleep episode, or his alertness\
  \ levels on waking, it is \ndifficult to assess the likelihood of the severity or\
  \ duration of sleep inertia effects\".  \nDoes the 72 -hour sleep history suggest\
  \ a sleep debt?  \nProfessor Gander said  the 72 -hour history suggests that the\
  \ master and the second mate \nhad \"minimal opportunity for night time sleep in\
  \ that time and are therefore likely to have \nbeen experiencing the cumulative\
  \ effects of sleep debt\" . The master did not have a \nminimum rest period of six\
  \ h ours on any of the six days preceding the grounding.  \nWhere the data for certain\
  \ periods conflicted, the A TSB conservatively gave priority to the \nreported sleep,\
  \ and where there were gaps in the evidence it assumed that sleep was \nconsistent\
  \ with the person' s \"usual \" sleep periods.  \nThe ATSB report said that based\
  \ on the evidence provided, \" Rena 's master reportedly obtained \nabout 11 hours\
  \ of sleep in the 24 hours leading up to the grounding (that is, from 0200 on 4\
  \ \nOctober) and about 15 -\xBD hours of sleep in the  48 hours prior (from 0200\
  \ on 3 October). The \nsecond mate reportedly obtained about 8 -\xBD hours of sleep\
  \ in the 24 hours prior to the \ngrounding and about 18 hours of sleep in the 48\
  \ hours prior. If these sleep estimates are \naccurate, based on the prior sleep\
  \ -wake model, this suggests that neither the master nor the \nsecond mate were\
  \ at risk of significant  performance impairment (emphasis added) attributable \n\
  to fatigue during the watch period preceding the accident\".  \nThe ATSB report\
  \ said that when considering t he master's five-day work/rest pattern, the FAST\
  \ \nanalysis demonstrated that \"during most of the work periods reported between\
  \ 2 October and 5 \nOctober, the master's performance was likely to have been at\
  \ least  mildly  affected by fatigue  \n(emphasis added) . During the work period\
  \ 2200 on 3 October to 0300 on 4 October, the FAST \nprogram indicated that the\
  \ master's fatigue risk reached an 'unacceptably' high level (red \nzone27), by\
  \ the end of the shift, with time of day, recent sleep length and accumulated sleep\
  \  \ndebt all highlighted as risk factors for this period \".  \nThe ATSB report\
  \ said that when considering the second  mate's five-day work/rest pattern, the\
  \ \nFAST analysis highlighted that his schedule of work and sleep placed him at,\
  \ at least, a mild to \nmoderate risk for fatigue -impaired performance.  Further,\
  \ \"that for each of the second mate's \nwatch periods, his fatigue risk was within\
  \ the yellow zone28, and over the course of each of the \n0000 to 0600 work periods,\
  \ his predicted effectiveness fell below the dotte d criterion line, \nindicating\
  \ performance equivalent to that of a person who has missed an entire night's sleep.\
  \ \n                                                        \n27 Performance is\
  \ indicated to be less than 65% effectiveness.  \n28 Performance is indicated to\
  \ be between 65% and 90% effectiveness.  \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Final report 11 -204\
  \ Specifically, for the period preceding the grounding, the second mate's cognitive\
  \ effectiveness \nhas been assessed as being within the yellow zon e, with time\
  \ of day being highlighted as a risk \nfactor \".  \n4.4.11.  The terminology used\
  \ by the FAST software developers refers to the yellow zone and then the \ndotted\
  \ criterion line within the yellow zone.  Entering the yellow zone starts occurring\
  \ during \nthe night when someone is missing an entire night's sleep.  That is,\
  \ a watchkeeper may start \ndrifting into the yellow zone as they start not getting\
  \ their normal sleep.  If they go a whole \nnight without sleep (awake for 24 hours)\
  \ they will fall below the dotted crit erion line  within the \nyellow zone .  As\
  \ a watchkeeper approaches the time that they would normally sleep on the \nsecond\
  \ night (effectively 40 hours without sleep) they will begin to enter the red zone.\
  \  \n4.4.12.  Figure 6 shows a sample screenshot for a watchkeeper who  begins with\

  \ reports of Dr Gander and the ATSB.  The methodology used in \neach was different,\
  \ but both agree d that t he extent to which fatigue contributed to the \ngrounding\
  \ was difficult to quantify.  The ATSB said that t he FAST analysis of the work/sleep\
  \ \nevidence showed  that both the master 's and the second  mate's performance\
  \ was at least \nmildly affected by fatigue .  The ATSB  also said that their actions\
  \ and omissions on the night of \nthe grounding were consistent with fatigue.  However\
  \ , those same actions and omissions  were \noccasionally demonstrated throughout\
  \ the Rena 's voyages as discussed earlier in this report.  \nFor example , the\
  \ lack of cross -checking information during the watch handover from second \nmate\
  \ to master on the morning of the grounding was consistent with fatigue, but it\
  \ was also \nconsistent with typical watch handovers between the second mate and\
  \ the master on other \nvoyages.  \n4.4.14.  The effect s of sleep inertia could\
  \ have been significant for the master, particularly when he \nanswer ed the wake\
  \ -up call from the  second  mate at 0135 and agreed to his deviating from \nthe\
  \ passage plan  to save time, and again when he first arrived on the bridge and\
  \ began \nassuming control of the ship from the second mate.   However , as the\
  \ experts note d above , \nthis is difficult to determine without evidence of the\
  \ sleep stage from which he was woken at \n0135.  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n\
  << Page 33 >>\n 4.4.15.  The FAST analysis show ed that both the master and the\
  \ second mate were at risk of their \ncognitive performance being impaired by fatigue\
  \ at times during th e 72  hour period before the \ngrounding.  However, their actual\
  \  level s of impairment are difficult to quantify without having \nmore information\
  \ on the seven factors mentioned in the ATSB 's \"limitations in analysis \" \n\
  mentioned above ( paragraph 4.4. 9).  The accu racy of that information was either\
  \ questionable \nor not available to the Commission.   Consequently, it was not\
  \ possible to determine whether \ntheir actions leading up to the grounding were\
  \ attributable to fatigue.  \nFindings:  \n10. The master's work and sleep schedule\
  \ in the three days preceding the accident \nplaced him at risk of his cognitive\
  \ performance being impaired by fatigue.  The \ncombination of the effects of time\
  \ of day for sleep and work, sleep duration , and \nsleep fragmentat ion acted to\
  \ create significant sleep debt.  \n11. The second mate's work and sleep schedule\
  \ in the three  days before the \naccident meant that there was , at least , a mild\
  \ to moderate risk of his cognitive \nperformance being impaired by fatigue.  \n\
  12. The performance of b oth the master and the second mate was likely to have \n\
  been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight  to 0215,\
  \ \nthe period leading up to the grounding , but t here  was insufficient eviden\
  \ ce to  \ndetermine whether  their actions leading u p to the grounding were attributable\
  \ to \nfatigue.  \n4.5. Safety management system  \nBackground  \n4.5.1.  A number\
  \ of very serious maritime accidents that occurred during the late 1980s  were \n\
  manifestly caused by human errors, with management faults also identified as contributing\
  \ \nfactors.   In response , the ISM Code  was developed and made mandatory by Chapter\
  \ IX of \nSOLAS29. \n4.5.2.  The ISM Code  requires a safety management system to\
  \ be established by the \"ship owner or \nany person who has assumed responsibility\
  \ for the ship\".  The objectives of the ISM Code are \nto ensure safety at sea,\
  \ the prevention of human injury or loss of life, and the avoida nce of \ndamage\
  \ to the environment, in particular to the marine environment and to property. \
  \ \n4.5.3.  The ISM Code says that the safety management objectives of the company\
  \ should, inter alia:  \n\uF0B7 provide for safe practices in ship operation and\
  \ a safe working environmen t \n\uF0B7 establish safeguards against all identified\
  \ risks  \n\uF0B7 continuously improve safety management skills of personnel ashore\
  \ and aboard ships, \nincluding preparing for emergencies related both to safety\
  \ and environmental protection.  \nThe ISM Code  also says that the safety management\
  \ system should ensure:  \n\uF0B7 compliance with mandatory rules and regulations\
  \  \n\uF0B7 that applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the Organization,\
  \ \nAdministrations, classification societies and maritime industry organiza tions\
  \ are taken into \naccount.  \n                                                \
  \        \n29 International Safety Management Code Resolution A.741(18) as amended\
  \ by MSC.104(73), MSC.179(79), \nMSC.195(80) and MSC.273(85 ). \n \n\n<< Page 34\
  \ >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.5.4.  The ISM Code further says that in order to comply\
  \ with the ISM Code, each vessel must have a \nworking  safety management system\
  \ , which will typically consist of the following elements:  \n\uF0B7 commitment\
  \ from top management  \n\uF0B7 a Top Tier Policy Manual  \n\uF0B7 a Procedures\
  \ Manual that documents what is done on board the ship, during norm al \noperations\
  \ and in emergency situations  \n\uF0B7 procedures for conducting both internal\
  \ and external audits to ensure the crew are \nfollowing procedures as laid out\
  \ in the Procedures Manual  \n\uF0B7 a Designated Person Ashore to serve as a direct\
  \ link between the vessel's  crew  and senior \nmanagement ashore, and to verify\
  \ the safety management  system implementation  \n\uF0B7 a system for identifying\
  \ where actual practices do not meet those that are documented and \nfor implementing\
  \ associated corrective action  \n\uF0B7 regular management reviews . \n4.5.5. \
  \ There are two aspects to the ISM Code system . The first is the safety management\
  \ system \nfrom the perspective of the vessel manager (CIEL ) , which was subject\
  \ to both external audits \non behalf of the flag state Liberia and internal audits.\
  \  The second aspect was the safety \nmanagement system  as applied  on board the\
  \ Rena .  \n4.5.6.  When safety issues were identified with the standard of voyage\
  \ planning and navigation on \nboard the Rena , the Commission examined those aspects\
  \ of the Rena 's working safety \nmanagement s ystem and CIEL's oversight of those\
  \ aspects .  The Commission also considered \nthe port state control records for\
  \ the Rena  and other ships managed by the Rena 's owners.  \nPort state control\
  \ records provide one indicator as to how well a safety management system is \n\
  functioning.  \nSafe ship management system  on board the Rena  \nSafety issue \
  \ - The CIEL oversight of the safety management system as applied on board the Rena\
  \  was \nnot sufficient  to prevent a high number of port state control  deficiencies\
  \ and violation s of some \ncompany procedures for voyage planning and navigation.\
  \  \n4.5.7.  The design of the safety management system applied on  board the Rena\
  \  (what the company \nsays the crew will do) went some way to meeting the intent\
  \ of the ISM Code .  However, the \ndocumentation  that the crew were required to\
  \ read in order to find out what was required of \nthem was excessive.  For example\
  \ , the system relied onl y on reference to nautical publications \nsuch as The\
  \ Nautical Institute 's Bridge Team Management  - A Practical Guide  as the standard\
  \ \nto be met.  While such publications are helpful and essential, the requirements\
  \ would be \nbetter summarised and included in s imple templates, flow -diagrams,\
  \ checklists and quick \nreference guides for the crew to use.  \n4.5.8.  In its\
  \ submission on the draft  final report CIEL  said that this suggestion was an \"\
  outdated \napproach\" to ISM  Code  implementation because it was \"overly prescriptive\
  \ and discourages \nactive analysis and application by the crew involved\".  The\
  \ Commission does not agree.  It is \ntrue that safety management systems should\
  \ avoid being overly  prescriptive .  However, it is \nequally important that the\
  \ system  does not place too much reliance  on crew having to extract \nkey information\
  \ from large documents that , realistically,  will rarely  be read .  Extracting\
  \ the key \npoints relevant to a particular shipboard operation is a useful method\
  \ of highlighting important \ninformation to the crew.  CIEL has used this approach\
  \ in summarising the key elements of \nother IMO documents.  \n4.5.9.  The safety\
  \ management system as applied on board was subject to external audits on behalf\
  \ \nof the flag state Liberia, and internal audits.  The Co mmission obtained the\
  \ internal audit \nreports conducted on the Rena  by CIEL .  Internal audits are\
  \ a system for identifying where \nactual practices do not meet those that are documented\
  \ and for implementing associated \ncorrective actions referred to in the ISM Code.\
  \  They are an important process because if done \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<<\
  \ Page 35 >>\n properly they show a company commitment to ensuring that the documented\
  \ system is \nimplemented on the vessel and  is working.  \n4.5.10.  The CIEL safety\
  \ management system30 said that the objective s of internal audits were  to: \n\uF0B7\
  \ determine the implementation and effectiveness of the safety management system\
  \  \n\uF0B7 determin e conformity or non -conformity of safety management system\
  \ elements with \nspecified contractual requirements  \n\uF0B7 provide a basis for\
  \ improvement of the safety management system  \n\uF0B7 meet regulatory requirements.\
  \  \n4.5.11.  A single audit cannot realistically cover every aspect of a ship's\
  \ operation , but monitoring \nindicators of past and present performance is a good\
  \ method for deciding on the  areas on \nwhich to focus.  \n4.5.12.  In April 2011\
  \ the Rena 's Designated Person Ashore31 sailed on the vessel for four days, during\
  \ \nwhich time h e conducted a  CIEL internal ISM Code audit  of the Rena 's safe\
  \ ship management \nsystem .  The Designated Person Ashore was a qualified master\
  \ -mariner and would therefore \nhave been well qualified to detect any navigational\
  \ deficiencies.  It is possible that the \nDesignated Person Ashore's audit plan\
  \ did not include assessment s of watchkeeping and \nnavigation procedures, but\
  \ a lot can be covered in four days and it would be surprising if the \nsafety -critical\
  \ function of bridge operations had not in some way been assessed.  \n4.5.13.  The\
  \ audit report did list several deficiencies associated with the bridge, including\
  \ that the \ncompass error was not being determined at least once every watch. \
  \ This finding show ed that \nbridge procedures were covered by the audit to some\
  \ degree.  However, these observations \nneed to be tempered by the knowledge that\
  \ crew generally lift their performance immediately \nbefore and during a planned\
  \ audit.  This makes it more difficult for t he auditor to identify any \nnon-conformities\
  \ or observations that would otherwise be raised.  Also,  an auditor would not \n\
  necessarily focus in so much detail on one aspect of shipboard operations as an\
  \ investigation \ndoes after an accident or incident has occ urred, unless that\
  \ area of operation was of \nparticular interest for some reason.  \n4.5.14.  While\
  \ he was on board , the crew were not complying with the safety management system\
  \ with \nrespect to passage planning/execution and position fixing.  Evidence of\
  \ this was foun d in \ndocuments recovered from the Rena  and from the voyages reconstructed\
  \  after  the grounding .  \nHowever, the Designated Person Ashore 's audit report\
  \ did not note any other deficiencies \nregarding navigation or watchkeeping practices.\
  \    \n Port state control  \nSafety issue  - The number of port state control deficiencies\
  \ identified against the Rena  and its \ndetention in Fremantle for non -compliance\
  \ with  statutory  requirements indicates  that the safety \nmanagement system as\
  \ applied on board the Rena  was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code.  \n\
  Safety issue  - Eight of the 12 vessels managed by CIEL had higher rate s of deficiencies\
  \ per inspection \nthan the  average of all other  vessels subjected to port state\
  \ control inspections in the Asia -Pacific \nregion  in the same period .  The Rena\
  \ 's deficiency rate was almost twice the average.  This indicated \nthat the CIEL\
  \ safety management system  for the vessels operating in the Asia -Pacific region,\
  \ and for the \nRena , was not functioning as it could have been according to the\
  \ ISM Code . \n4.5.15.  The discussion above refers only to voyage planning and\
  \ navigation standards.  A port state  \ncan inspect a vessel to ensure  that it\
  \ is operating safely and in compliance with regulatory \n                     \
  \                                   \n30 CIEL Shipmanagement Quality and Safety\
  \ Management System Office Manual . \n31 The Designated Person Ashore is described\
  \ in the IS M Code as the person providing the link between the \nship and the highest\
  \ level of management ashore.  \n\n<< Page 36 >>\n Final report 11 -204 requirements\
  \  while in its waters , which is also  a primary purpose  of a vessel 's safety\
  \ \nmanagement system.  Thus, the port state  control  inspection record can be\
  \ used as an \nindicator of how effective ly a vessel 's safety management system\
  \ is working .  \n4.5.16.  To better co -ordinate the  port state  control  inspection\
  \ of ships , IMO has encouraged the \nestablishment of regional port state  control\
  \  organi sations  that operate to  agreements on port \nstate  control  (memoranda\
  \ of understanding ).  Such memoranda cover all of the world 's \noceans.   The\
  \ system was set up to avoid duplication of inspections on ships trading exclusively\
  \ \nin one area, and to ensure that any deficiencies raised in one State are recorded,\
  \ tracked and , \nwhen rectified, closed out  (possibly by another State ).   \n\
  4.5.17.  When an inspec tion is carried out the resultant report is submitted to\
  \ the relevant co -\nordinating organisation .  New Zealand , for example , is a\
  \ signatory to the Tokyo Memorandum \nof Understanding , which covers the Asia -Pacific\
  \ region32.   \n4.5.18.  Port state  control  inspections are usually conducted\
  \ by the states ' maritime administration s \nand typically check ship and crew\
  \  certification as well as ships' safety equipment and \nmaintenance.  For example\
  \ , an inspection of the bridge may include checking that the charts \nfor the voyage\
  \ are valid and up  to date.  An obsolete  or out -of-date  chart would be identified\
  \ as \na deficiency in the port state  control  inspection report .   \n4.5.19.\
  \  When a deficiency is identified and recorded , the crew must rectify that deficiency.\
  \  Each \ndeficiency is recorded using one of six classification codes according\
  \ to the nature and \nseverity of the deficiency.  The classification then gives\
  \ the timeframe to rectify the problem.  \nThe six cl assification codes are given\
  \ in Table 5.  Two categories of particular interest are \nCode 17 and Code 30.\
  \  A classification of Code 17 means the vessel should not sail until the \ndeficiency\
  \  is rectified.  A classification of Code 30 means the deficiency is s erious enough\
  \ to \ndetain the vessel until it has been rectified to the satisfaction of the\
  \ port state control  officer.  \nA Code 30 deficiency will also be reported to\
  \ the flag state, which will usually trigger a flag \nstate inspection of the vessel.\
  \  \n4.5.20.  The Commission obtained the port state  control  records for the Rena\
  \ , and also those records \nfor other ships operated by CIEL and the other two\
  \ management companies of Costamare Inc.  \nOf 18 deficiencie s recorded against\
  \ the Rena  in China , 12 were class ified as Code 17 \n(required to  be rectified\
  \ before departure) and  six were class ified as Code 16 ( required to be \nrectified\
  \ within 14 days).  (See Appendix 3 for the full inspection report .) \n4.5.21.\
  \  About two weeks later the Rena  underwent another  \"initial \"33 port state\
  \  control inspection in \nFreemantle, Australia.  That inspection resulted in a\
  \ further 17 new deficiencies, of which:  \n\uF0B7 three  were classed as Code 30\
  \ (the ship was detained)  \n\uF0B7 11 were classed as Code 17 (required to be rectified\
  \ before the vessel sailed)  \n\uF0B7 two were  classed as Code 16 (required to\
  \ be rectified within 14 days)  \n\uF0B7 one was classed as Code 18 (required to\
  \ be rectified within three  months) . \n4.5.22.  The Code 18 deficiency was related\
  \ to CIEL's safety management system  as applied on  board \nthe Rena .  \"The ISM\
  \ has not ensured maintenance of the ship and equipment , as evidenced \nby 15 deficiencies\
  \ [Code 16 and 17 deficiencies ].\" (See Appendix 4 for  the full inspection \n\
  report .) \n                                                        \n32 The following\
  \ states have accepted the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding: Australia, Marshall\

  \ Fiji, Russian Federation, Hong Kong \n(China), Singapore, Indonesia, Solomon Islands,\
  \ Japan, Thailand, Republic of Korea, Vanuatu, Malaysia  and \nVietnam .  \n33 An\
  \ initial inspection is considered a new inspection because the vessel is considered\
  \ by the port state to \nbe due, usually judged on the time since the last inspection.\
  \ An initial inspection may identify new \ndeficiencies.  \n  \nFinal report 11\
  \ -204 \n<< Page 37 >>\n 4.5.23.  All but one of the port state  control  deficiencies\
  \ newly identified in China and Australia had \nbeen closed out in follow -up34\
  \ inspections in Fremantle, Melbourne, Sydney , and Bluff .  The \nexception was\
  \ the Code 18 deficiency relating t o the ISM Code , which had a timespan of three\
  \  \nmonths to allow the ship and ship  management company to make the necessary\

  \ owned by subsidiaries of Costamare \nInc. were analysed  for the period from 1\
  \ June 2009 to 31 December 2011.   The source data \nfor this analysis was taken\
  \ from Maritime New Zealand , records seized from the Rena35, port \nstate  control\
  \  memoranda of understanding databases, and information  provided by CIEL .  \n\
  4.5.25.  The vessels owned by subsidiaries of Costamare Inc. were managed by three\
  \ vessel \nmanagement companies  that were established to serve the Costamare fleet\
  \ of container  \nships36. The three management companies were Costamare Shipping\
  \ Company S.A., Shanghai \nCostamar e Shipmanagement Co. Ltd. and CIEL.  \n4.5.26.\
  \  Costamare Inc . operated 76 vessels in three fleets. A  broad overview of the\
  \ port state  control  \ninspection record for th ose 76 identified vessels is given\
  \ in  table 6 .  \n4.5.27.  The fleet managed by C IEL had a higher rate of deficiencies\
  \ per inspection than the other two \nfleets.  Even so, CIEL's rate of 2 .5 deficiencies\
  \ per inspection was lower than the \ncorresponding memoranda average  for all vessels\
  \ , which was  3.0 deficiencies per inspection.   \nThis resul t suggests that overall\
  \ the CIEL  safety management system  was operating \neffectively.     \n \n  \n\
  \                                                        \n34 A follow -up inspection\
  \ is diffe rent from an initial inspection.  A follow -up inspection  usually only\
  \ looks at \nverifying and closing out previously identified deficiencies ; the\
  \ purpose is not to identify new deficiencies . \n35 Not all vessels used in this\

  \ the nature of port state  control inspections in the \ndifferent memoranda regions.\
  \ Because different fleets can operate exclusively in one or more \nof these regions,\
  \ a better comparison of port state  control performa nce can be obtained by \n\
  considering the data within each region.  That is, the vessels are inspected against\
  \ the same \ncriteria.  \n4.5.29.  The CIEL fleet vessels had been inspected under\
  \ at least six port state  control memoranda of \nunderstanding, and there were\
  \ also s ome inspections carried out by the United States Coast \nGuard.  Not all\
  \ memoranda statistics were available and so a comparison of the CIEL fleet \nagainst\
  \ the corresponding memoranda was possible for only three of the memoranda of \n\
  understanding (which accoun ts for 63% of all CIEL inspections).  Table 7 shows\
  \ a comparison \nof CIEL against the corresponding memoranda of understanding. \
  \ \n4.5.30.  The vessels managed by CIEL accrued a rate of deficiencies per inspection\
  \ that was \nsignificantly lower than the average in at least two of the port state\
  \  control regions (24% of \ninspections). However , 39% of CIEL inspections were\
  \ accrued under the Tokyo Mem orandum \nof Understanding  where the rate of deficiencies\
  \ was slightly  higher than the  average.  The \nrelevant data was not available\
  \ to make a comparison for the remaining 37% of inspections \n(which covered the\
  \ regions of another three memoranda of understandi ng and the United \nStates Coast\

  \ half of those deficiencies were classified as Code 17 and thus were \nrequired\

  \ 11 -204 4.5.34.  The reported deficiencies were an indication that the CIEL safety\
  \ management system  was not \nensuring  that the Rena  was maintained and operated\
  \ in accordance with regulatory \nrequirements , an observation supported by the\
  \ 17 th deficiency raised in Fremantle - \"ISM \nrelated deficiency/maintenance\
  \ of the ship and equipment  - ISM has not ensured \nmaintenance of ship and equipment\
  \ as evidenced by deficiencies 1 -15\".  \nSummary of safety management systems\
  \  \n4.5.35.  Port state control  inspections  are an indicator of the effectiveness\
  \ of a vessel 's safety \nmanagement system in achieving its purpose.  An effective\
  \  safety management system should \nensure compliance with mandatory rules and\
  \ regulations.   The port state control record for \nvessels managed  by CIEL  indicates\
  \  that the CIEL safety management system was operating \nrelatively effectively\
  \ in the regions  considered .    \n4.5.36.  However, t he number of deficiencies\
  \ identified against the Rena  and its detention in \nFremantle for non -compliance\
  \ with  statut ory requirements  indicate that the safety \nmanagement s ystem as\
  \ applied on board the Rena  was not meeting the objectives of the ISM \nCode. \
  \ Also, there  were clear indications that t he safety management system on board\
  \ the  \nRena  was not functioning properly with respect to bridge and navigation\
  \ procedures.  \n4.5.37.  CIEL's safety management system was integral to the vessels\
  \ it managed, including the Rena . \nTherefore if the Rena 's safety management\
  \ system was  not meeting the objectives of the ISM \nCode , neither were some aspe\
  \ cts of the CIEL safety management system.  \n4.5.38.  When the Commission asked\
  \ CIEL whether  any audits, reviews or safety actions had been \nunder taken in\
  \ response to the Rena  grounding , it responded , \"Ciel's position is the same\
  \ as \nhas been established in the court process in New Zealand and as evidenced\
  \ by the \ninformation provided.  The incident was caused by unfortunate human errors\
  \ and the \nnegligent discharge of duties by well qualified officers who had be\
  \ en tested over time in their \nroles - not by any non -conformity with the system\
  \ or deficiency in the system\"38. \n4.5.39.  The Commission agrees that human error\
  \ was one factor contributing to the grounding, but \nthere were  several  other\
  \  contributing  factors that stemme d from safety  issues within broader  \nsystems.\
  \  There is some evidence that the CIEL safety management system , for its vessels\
  \  \ntrading in the Asia-Pacific region , was not adequate to ensure safe ship operation\
  \  and \ncompliance with regulatory requir ements .  However, t he Commission did\
  \ not conduct an \ninvestigation into CIEL's safety management system  for all its\
  \ vessels, and CIEL did not \nprovide the Commission with information relevant to\
  \ the broader system when the \nCommission asked for it.  The Commission is accordingly\
  \ unable to determine whether \nbroader issues with  the CIEL safety management\
  \ system  contributed to the accident.  \n4.5.40.  With respect to port state control\
  \ records, other vessels managed by CIEL also had higher \nrates of deficiencies\
  \ than the average for the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding .  CIEL \nmay wish\
  \ to evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the\
  \ \nissues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena  do not affect\
  \ other vessels \nwithin its fleet.  \n4.5.41.  CIEL's submission  about the qualifications\
  \ and experience of the crew is discussed in the \nfollowing section - International\
  \ seafarer training and certification systems . \n \n                          \
  \                              \n38 At the outset of the investigation CIEL invited\
  \ the investigators to travel to Greece to see first hand its \nsafety management\
  \ system.  The investigators did not travel at that time because they were still\
  \ in the early \nphase of the in vestigation.  Given CIEL's  response to these questions,\
  \ the Commission decided the cost of \ntravel to Greece would outweigh the benefits.\
  \  \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 41 >>\n Findings:  \n13. The master and\
  \ crew of the Rena  were not following navigation and \nwatchkeeping standards and\
  \ procedures set down in the safety management \nsystem  on board the  Rena  for\
  \ at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the \ngrounding .  The f ailure\
  \ to follow the se standards set out in the Rena 's safety \nmanagement system was\
  \ a factor contrib uting to the grounding.  \n14. There were clear indications that\
  \ the safety management system on board the \nRena  was not functioning properly\
  \ with respect to bridge and navigation \nprocedures.  \n15. The number  of port\
  \ state control deficiencies identified against the Rena  and its \ndetention in\
  \ Fremantle  for non-compliance with  statut ory requirements indicate  \nthat the\
  \ safety management system as applied on board the Rena  was not \nmeeting the objectives\
  \ of the ISM Code.  \n \n4.6. International seafarer t raining  and certification\
  \ systems  \n4.6.1.  The standard of watchkeeping on the bridge of the Rena  was\
  \ not consistent with the \nrequirements of the STCW Convention . Given the deficiencies\
  \ identified with the performance \nof the master and crew of the Rena , the Commission\
  \ considered their initial and ongoing \ntraining , and the broader system in which\
  \ that training had taken  place.  The Commission \nfurther considered whether improvements\
  \ could be made to the international seafarer training \nand certification sys tem\
  \ that would assist in minimising the risk of future accidents and \nincidents similar\
  \ to the Rena  grounding.   \nRena  bridge team training and development  \n4.6.2.\
  \  Both the master and the second mate on board the Rena  when it grounded on Astrolabe\
  \ Reef \nhad received initial and ongoing training through the Philippine s' maritime\
  \ education, training \nand certification system , between 1990 and 2007 for the\
  \ master and 1995 and 2010 for the \nsecond mate.  \n4.6.3.  The performance of\
  \ a s eafarer is dependent not only on the standards set by their initial and \n\
  ongoing training, but also on the performance standards and culture of the companies\
  \ within \nwhich they have carried out their service.  \n4.6.4.  The master had\
  \ been employed by a number of diffe rent companies before, during and after \n\
  completing his training for master qualification.  He had been employed by CIEL\
  \  since 2007, \ninitially as first officer and then as captain.  \n4.6.5.  The\
  \ second officer had been employed by CIEL since 2003.  He had initially been employed\
  \ as \nan able -bodied seaman and was then progressively promoted to junior officer,\
  \ third officer and \nthen to second officer on board the Rena , all under the master\
  \ in command of the Rena  when \nit ran aground.  \n4.6.6.  Both the master and\
  \ the second mate ha d therefore been trained and had worked in the \nsame systems\
  \ for a number of years.  The Commission considered whether the training \nreceived\
  \ by the crew might have played a part in their actions leading up to the grounding.\
  \   \n4.6.7.  Independent audit s and inspections  of the Philippines ' training\
  \ system were conducted by \nEMSA  in the period 2006 to the present .  They established\
  \ that there were serious \ndeficiencies with that system and its compliance with\
  \ the standards required by the STCW \nConvention during t he period in which  the\
  \ crew received training. The reports  raised the more \ngeneral possibility that\
  \ seafarers coming through the Philippines ' training system during this \nperiod\
  \ could have received training  that did not meet the requisite standards .  \n\n\
  << Page 42 >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.6.8.  Whilst  the deficiencies in the Philippine\
  \ s' training system coincide d with the period of ongoing \ntraining of the master\
  \ and crew of the Rena , the Commission is unable to make any definitive \nfindings\
  \ that any issues with the ongoing training contributed to the ac cident , as it\
  \ was not \npossible to undertake the broad review required to support such a finding.\
  \ Nor did the \nCommission have specific information relating to the Rena  crew's\
  \ individual training \nexperiences in the Philippines to find that their training\
  \ con tributed to the Rena 's grounding.  \n4.6.9.  While not a factor specific\
  \ to this accident, the Commission's enquiries nevertheless raised \nbroader issues\
  \ about the transparency of seafarer training standards under the STCW \nConvention,\
  \ which may have broader safety implications for marine transport.  \nBackground\
  \  of the STCW Convention  \n4.6.10.  An intended outcome of IMO was global uniformity\
  \ of shipping standards , so that vessels \ntrading internationally could do so\
  \ as seamlessly as possible , and to the same standards.   The \nobjective of the\
  \ STCW Convention was to ensure that common minimum  standards applied to \nthe\
  \ crew  of those vessel s. The purpose of the STCW Convention was  to \"promote\
  \ safety of life \nand property at sea and the protection of the marine environment\
  \ by establishing in common \nagreement international standards of training, certification\
  \ and watchkeeping for seafarers\".  \nThe STCW Convention  was amended  in 1991,\
  \ 1 994, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2006, and most \nrecently in 2010. A chronological\
  \ history of the amendments and a summary of the changes \nmade are included in\
  \ Appendix 5. \n4.6.11.  By 200 2 there were 82 States that were signatories to\
  \ the STCW Convention, including the \nPhilippines.  The Philippines estimated that\
  \ it had issued more than 300,000 seafarer \ncertificates  of competenc e prior\
  \ to 2002 . \n4.6.12.  The a chievement of c ommon standards of seafarer  training\
  \ and certification  is important  as \ncrew who have been trained in one State\
  \ may go on to man vessels registered in other  States.  \nThe State in which a\
  \ vessel is registered has some re sponsibility  for ensuring that the \nseafarers\
  \ to whom it issues licences  of competence  have been trained to  the standards\
  \ \nrequired by the  STCW Co nvention.    \n4.6.13.  All State s in the maritime\
  \ community also rely on the training and certification of seafarers \nprovided\
  \  by other State s, as vessels with crew trained in other jurisdictions come into\
  \ the \nterritorial waters of other State s.  The international training and certification\
  \ system is \naccordingly important to all State s, including New Zealand.  \n4.6.14.\
  \  The Commission  accordingly considered whether the deficiencies identified by\
  \ EMSA  in the \naudit process were appropriately addressed by the  broader training\
  \ and certification system.  \nPhilippine s' seafarer training system  \nSafety\
  \ issue  - Independent audits had found that the Philippine  seafarer training system\
  \ did not meet \nthe standards specified by the STCW Convention  at both systemic\
  \ and trai ning institute levels . \n4.6.15.  EMSA  conducted the audit  of, and\
  \ follow -up reports on the Philippine s' seafarer training \nsystem.  It is one\
  \ of the European Union's (EU's) decentralised agencies.  The agency provides \n\
  technical assistance and support to the European Commission and member  states in\
  \ the \ndevelopment and implementation of E U legislation on maritime safety, pollution\
  \ by ships , and \nmaritime security.  \n4.6.16.  EMSA  began auditing  the Philippines\
  \ ' maritime education, training and certification system  in \n2004 .  The initial\
  \ audit was to review the suitability of the EU states to continu e to recognise\
  \ \ncertificates issued by the Philippines.  The timing of the EMSA  audit corresponded\
  \ with the \nPhilippines ' five-yearly audit required by the STCW  Convention  (as\
  \ discussed in the next \nsection , Implementing the STCW Convention ).  Consequently\
  \ the EMSA  audit served both \npurposes . \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page\
  \ 43 >>\n 4.6.17.  EMSA  issued its first audit report in 2006 , which investigators\
  \ from the  Commission were able \nto view , although a copy of it was not made\
  \ available.  The Commission obtained copies of \nEMSA 's 2010 report of its follow\
  \ -up inspection, and a draft of the 2012 report of its further \nfollow -up inspection\
  \ .  These reports found that at  a higher level there were deficiencies and \n\"\
  dysfunction\" between the several agencies that had a role in administering the\
  \ Philippine s' \nseafarer training system.  There w ere also deficiencies at the\
  \ level of individual training \ninstitutes.  \n4.6.18.  In 2011 the Phi lippines\
  \ had submitted a response report to EMSA  detailing corrective \nmeasures taken\
  \  following the 2010 follow -up inspection and report.  The 2012 draft report of\
  \ \nthe further follow -up inspection continued to record significant deficiencies,\
  \ however . \n4.6.19.  Although the 2012 EMSA  draft report  acknowledged progress,\
  \ it still found serious issues with \nthe maritime education, training and certification\
  \ system.  In November 2012 the European \nCommission issued \"Information\"39 to\
  \ EU member States \"about shortcomings  in compliance \nby the Philippines' training\
  \ system and certification of seafarers with the requirements of the \nSTCW Convention\"\
  .  The Information said that:  \nrecent actions undertaken by the Philippines' government\
  \ have brought the \ncountry 's regulatory fram ework in line with the requirements\
  \ of the STCW \nConvention on the certification of seafarers and the quality standard\
  \ system to \nbe implemented by the administration. However, it also appears that\
  \ \nadministrative practices are still not in line with this new  regulatory framework.\
  \  \nAs a result, there are still deficiencies at the level of the administration40.\
  \ \n4.6.20.  The Information  went on to say that the deficiencies were \"mirrored\
  \ in the shortcomings \ndetected at the schools' level, relating to programmes,\
  \ methods, use of equipment and the \nabsence of equipment itself \"41. \n4.6.21.\
  \  The Information  concluded as follows:  \nIn conclusion, there is a clear constant\
  \ trend in the Philippines as regards \nensuring the full compliance with the requirements\
  \ of the STCW Convention. \nHowever, t his degree of compliance has not been achieved\
  \ yet.  Should this trend \nslow down and should full compliance with the requirements\
  \ of the STCW \nConvention not be achieved in a reasonable time -span - also considering\
  \ the \ntime that has already elapsed since the  first inspection - then, the withdrawal\
  \ of \nEU recognition of the Philippines in relation to its training and certification\
  \ \nsystem of seafarers should be fully taken into consideration . \n4.6.22.  When\
  \ the Commission's investigators visited Manila in October 2012, a major restructure\
  \ of \nthe Philippine s' maritime education, training and certification system had\
  \ begun in response \nto the 2012 EMSA  report.  Details of the corrective actions\
  \ are shown in the Safety actions \nsection (section 6) of this report.  \n4.6.23.\
  \  Given the deficiencies that EMSA  identified with the Philippine s' maritime\
  \ education, training \nand certification system  over a period of time  the Commission\
  \ considered the IMO system for \nimplementing the STCW Convention  in order to\
  \ identify whether improve ments to that system \nmight assist in reducing the risk\
  \ of future accidents and incidents to which deficiencies in the \ntraining of crew\
  \ may have contributed . \nImplementing the STCW Convention   \n4.6.24.  The STCW\
  \ [ 1995] Convention  required member States to submit to  IMO, by August 1998,\
  \ \ninformation on the steps taken by the State s to \"give the STCW [95] Convention\
  \ full and \ncomplete effect\"42.  The intention was that IMO publish a list of\
  \ States whose seafarer training \n                                            \
  \            \n39 2012/C 367/01 . \n40 Paragraph 11 (2012/C 367/01) . \n41 Paragraph\
  \ 12 ( 2012/ 21012 /C 367/01 ). \n42 STCW [1995] Convention Section A1/7.  \n\n\
  << Page 44 >>\n Final report 11 -204 systems could give full and complete effect\
  \ to the ST CW [ 1995] Convention.  This list became \nknown as the \"White List\"\
  .  \n4.6.25.  The White List  was published  in December 2000.  A statement released\
  \ by IMO (see Appendix \n6. said that \"A position [of a State] on the White List\
  \ entitles other [States] to accept, in \nprinciple , that certificates issued by\
  \ or on behalf of [States] on the White List are in \ncompliance with the Convention\"\
  .  \n4.6.26.  The acceptance of a State on the White List did not, however, involve\
  \ any assessment on \nwhether its seafarer training system did in fa ct meet those\
  \ standards.  It merely indicated that \nit \"could\" do so.  Regulation I/10 of\
  \ the STCW [ 1995] Convention continued to place the \nresponsibility on the member\
  \ States to satisfy themselves that other States' systems were \ncompliant before\
  \ recognisin g certificates issued by them.  \n4.6.27.  It became apparent that\
  \ there was uncertainty over the significance of the inclusion of a State \non the\
  \ White List, however.  As a result of an STCW [2010] Convention meeting , IMO \n\
  published (in June 2013) a circular43 that contained the following to remind  parties\
  \  of their \nobligations under Regulation I/10  regardless of the White List :\
  \ \nThe Committee draws the attention of maritime administrations, ship owners ,\
  \ \nship operators and managers, ship masters and other parties concerned to \n\
  the following:  \n.2 the fact that a Party is listed in the annex  [the White List]\
  \  does \nnot relieve those concerned of their obligations under the \nSTCW Convention\
  \ . \n4.6.28.  Regulation I/10 (as applied at the time of the Rena  grounding) read:\
  \  \n\"Regulation I/10 \nRecognition of certificates  \n1 Each Administration shall\
  \ ensure that the provisions of this regulation are complied with, in order to \n\
  recognize, by endorsement in accordance with regulation I/2, paragraph 544, a certificate\
  \ issued by or \nunder the author ity of another Party to a master, officer or radio\
  \ operator and that:  \n .1 the Administration has confirmed, through all necessary\
  \ measures, which may include \ninspection of facilities and procedures, that the\
  \ requirements concerning standards of \ncompetence , the issue and endorsement\
  \ of certificates and record keeping are fully complied \nwith; and  \n.2 an undertaking\
  \ is agreed with the Party concerned that prompt notification will be given of any\
  \ \nsignificant change in the arrangements for training and certification provided\
  \ in compliance with \nthe Convention.\"  \n \n4.6.29.  Because the Rena  was registered\
  \ in Liberia , the Commission considered the process  that \nLiberia  had followed\
  \ in meeting its obligations under Regulation I/10 when it recognised the \nPhilippine\
  \ certificates of competency . \n  \n                                          \

  4.6.30.  The Liberian Registry is administered by the Liberian International Ship\

  \ memorandum of understanding agreed that the Philippines \"shall make available\
  \ to \n[Liberia] the results of the external audit reports on the quality standards\
  \ evaluations \nconducted in accordance  with paragraph 3, Section A -1/8 of the\
  \ STCW Code\" (the five-year \nevaluations).  \n4.6.33.  The Philippines did not\
  \ offer , nor did Liberia ask for , copies of the EMSA audit and follow -up \nreports\
  \ produced  between 2006 and 2012.  Neither did the Philippines notify Liber ia\
  \ that it \nwas making major changes to the administration of its maritime education,\
  \ training and \ncertification system during 2012, which was a requirement under\
  \ the memorandum of \nunderstanding.  \n4.6.34.  The Liberia n Registry  submitted\
  \  that Liberia, in accordance w ith the STCW Convention and \npursuant to Regulation\
  \ I/10, recognised the Philippines ' certificates issued to the Philippine \nseafarers\
  \ serving on board the Rena .  It said that the inclusion of the Philippines on\
  \ the White \nList meant that it was \"deemed to have given full and complete effect\
  \ to the standards of the \nSTCW [1995] Convention\". As indicated above, however,\
  \ the inclusion of a State on the White \nList did not mean that the State had met\
  \ all its obligations.  Between 2000 (when the Whi te \nList was published) and\
  \ 2009 , the Liberian Registry did not visit or approve any training \ninstitutes.\
  \  The Liberian Registry visited and \"approved\" 15 different training institutes\
  \ in the \nPhilippines between June 2009 and April 2013.   \n4.6.35.  The Liberian\
  \ situ ation may not be unique.  It is a good example of how transparency in the\
  \ \naudit results could assist it and other member States in ensuring that the basis\
  \ for recognising \nseafarer certificates issued by other States is robust, without\
  \ having to repeat the full audit \nprocess themselves and risk overburdening the\
  \ entire global training system.  \n4.6.36.  If the terms agreed in the memorandum\
  \ of understanding between the Philippines and Liberia \nhad been followed, Liberia\
  \ could have been alerted as early as 2006 to proble ms the \nPhilippine s' maritime\
  \ education, training and certification system was having in ensuring  that \nthe\
  \ standards specified in the STCW Convention were met, and then taken whatever action\
  \ \nwas needed to satisfy its obligations under STCW Convention Regula tion I/10.\

  \ States' seafarer training systems  \nSafety issue  - The STCW Convention protocols\
  \ for auditing countries ' maritime education, training and \ncertification systems\
  \ lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess  easily  whether\
  \ \nto recognise the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant\
  \ with STCW standards . \n4.6.37.  States are required by the STCW Convention to\
  \ have independent evaluation s made of their \nseafarer training system s at intervals\
  \ not exceeding five years45.  The auditors raise any \ndeficiencies or non -compliances\
  \ with the State s concerned, together with the corrective \naction s required to\
  \ close them out.  The Philippines said  that the evaluations carried out by \n\
  EMSA had  served the purpose of the five-yearly audit .  This process has been described\
  \ in \nmore detail  above . \n4.6.38.  Consolidated audit reports from the five-yearly\
  \ evaluations must be submitted to IMO.  IMO \nevaluate s the content and publish\
  \ es a list of member State s that have demonstrated \"that \nthey were giving full\
  \ and complete effect to the relevant provisions of the STCW Convention \"46. \n\
  However , the audit reports are not disclosed to other member State s. Thus other\
  \ states are \ntheoretically required to undertake their own enquiries or audits\
  \ to satisfy the requir ements of \nSTCW Convention Regulation I/10 (to ensure \
  \ that their training and certification system s meet \nSTCW Convention standards\
  \ ). \n4.6.39.  If this were  to occur, it could lead to maritime administration\
  \ s being overwhelmed by auditors, \narguably to the detriment of administering\
  \ their own training and certification systems.  This \nrequirement seems  to contemplate\
  \  an unnec essary  duplication of resources that could be \navoided if the system\
  \ were  more transparent.   Until transparency can be achieved , it will be \ndifficult\
  \ to achieve uniformity of standards among the global training s ystems, which was\
  \ the \npurpose of introducing the STCW Convention.   For example, the consolidated\
  \ reports \nsubmitted to IMO could be made available to other member State s.  The\
  \ Commission \nacknowledges  that there may be counterv ailing interests to consider\
  \ around maintaining the \nconfidentiality of audits , but these are likely to be\
  \ outweighed by the  benefits of achieving \ngreater transparency and reducing duplication\
  \ of effort in achieving consistently high \nstandards of seafarer trainin g globally\
  \ . \nFuture status of the IMO White List  \n4.6.40.  The publication of the White\
  \ List  was the first time  that IMO had been given a direct role in the \nimplementation\
  \ of one of its instruments.  The intention behind creating the White List  was\
  \ to \nlift the global standard of seafarer training.  However, there was ambiguity\
  \ created by IMO \npublishing the White List and there is now a question about \
  \ the status  that the White List  \nshould be given and what a State's inclusion\
  \ on it actually signif ies. \n4.6.41.  Further, th ere is no agreed mechanism for\
  \ States to be removed from the White List  should \ntheir systems subsequently\
  \ be found to not meet the standards of the STCW Convention.  The \nmajority of\
  \ IMO's member States do not have  access to information that could or should  be\
  \ \nused to determine whether a State should remain on it - important information\
  \ that member \nStates should have to assist them to confirm \"through all necessary\
  \ measures\" whether the \nsystem in question complies with the STCW Convention.\

  \  Section A -I/8(3) National Objectives and quality standards . \n46 MSC 1/circ.1164\
  \ Rev 11 of 7 January 2013 . \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 47 >>\n Finding:\
  \  \n16. The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries ' maritime education,\
  \ \ntraining and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist\
  \ \nother countries to assess easily whether to recognise the qualification \ncertificates\
  \ issued by those countrie s as compliant with the STCW  Convention  \nstandards.\
  \  Better transparency of this process could avoid unnecessary \nduplication and\
  \ exp edite the harmonisation of global seafarer training and \ncertification systems.\
  \  \n4.7. Summary of issues affecting standards of navi gation  \n4.7.1.  The passage\
  \ planning and navigation during the Rena 's final voyage was substandard and \n\
  contributed to the grounding .  The sections above highlight safety issues with\
  \ the Rena 's \nsafety management system and with the Philippine s' and global \
  \ seafarer training and \ncertification system s.  These factors have their origins\
  \ in the wider system s in which many \nother ships worldwide  are operating.  \n\
  4.7.2.  The description of the global seafarer training system given in this report\
  \ , and how that could \naffect the standar ds of navigation on board ships worldwide\
  \ , is a salient reminder that ship \nowners and operators cannot afford to be complacent\
  \ about relying on the qualifications and \nexperience of the crews they employ.\
  \  \n4.7.3.  The issue involving  the implementation of the Philip pines' maritime\
  \ education, training and \ncertification system may not be unique.  Other training\
  \ administrations could have similar \nissues .  It may therefore be some considerable\
  \ time before true harmonisation of  the STCW  \nConvention  standards can be achieved\
  \ globally.  \n4.7.4.  Safety management systems are intended to ensure that industry\
  \ best practice and \nmandatory regulatory requirements are met, as a minimum. \
  \ It is therefore incumbent on ship \nowners, operators and man agers to ensure\
  \ that their safety management systems achieve \nthat on board their ships.  A good\
  \ safety management system should manage the risk that \nsome crews are poorly trained\
  \ in spite of their holding recognised maritime qualification s.  \nRequiring and\
  \ enforcing high standa rds on board their ships will help to manage that risk.\
  \  \n4.8. Coastal ship routing  \n4.8.1.  During the inquiry it was put to the Commission\
  \ that the introduction of mandatory ship \nrouting around the New Zealand coast,\
  \ and in particular around the approaches to the port of \nTauranga , was necessary\
  \ to prevent similar accidents to the Rena  grounding occurring again.  \nThe topic\
  \ has  also been debated in the media.  \n4.8.2.  The Commission considered this\
  \ issue and concluded that the introduction of ship routing for \nall coastal New\
  \ Zealand is not justified at this time.  There may , however , be a justification\
  \ for \nadopting some form of ship routing on a localised scale where a risk assessment\
  \ based on \nreal data on shipping movements reveals the need for such a system\
  \ .  The Commission has \nmade a broad search for data on shipping movements around\
  \ New Zealand and has \nconcluded  that the data currently available is not sufficient\
  \ to say one way or another whether \nthe introduction of ship routing would be\
  \ justified for any local coastal area .  If ship routing in \nany form were to\
  \ be introduced, either Maritime  New Zealand or local government would need \n\
  to collect sufficient data to support a proper risk assessment.  A credible risk\
  \ assessment \nshould give a credible answer as to whether ship routing is justified\
  \ in a given location.  \n4.8.3.  IMO is recognised as the only international body\
  \ for developing guidelines, criteria and \nregulations on an international level\
  \ for ships ' routing systems.  To understand the concept of \n\n<< Page 48 >>\n\
  \ Final report 11 -204 ship routing, it is necessary to refer to the SOLAS Convention\
  \ Regulation 5 and IMO General \nProvisions on Ships ' Routing 47.   \n4.8.4.  The\
  \ SOLAS Convention says that \"ship routing systems should be submitted to IMO for\
  \ \nadoption, but if a Government decides not to d o so then they are encouraged\
  \ to take into \naccount the guidelines and criteria developed by  IMO\" .  There\
  \ is a safety benefit if ships \nnavigating internationally can do so using ship\
  \ routing systems designed to the same criteria.  \nThis is consistent with the\
  \ purpose of IMO - harmonisation of standards across the globe.  \n4.8.5.  IMO's\
  \ General Provisions on Ships ' Routeing state s that the objective for ship routing\
  \ is to:  \n\"improve the safety of navigation in converging areas and in areas\
  \ where the density of traffic \nis great or where freedom of movement of shipping\
  \ is inhibited by restricted sea -room, the \nexistence of obstructions to navigation,\
  \ limited depths or unfavourable meteorological \nconditions\" . \n4.8.6.  The precise\
  \ objective of any IMO routing system is described as \" including some or all of\
  \ the \nfollowing:  \n\uF0B7 The separation of opposing streams of traffic so as\
  \ to reduce the incidence of head -on \ncollisions;  \n\uF0B7 The reduction of dangers\
  \ of collision between crossing traffic and shipping in established \ntraffic lanes;\
  \  \n\uF0B7 The simplif ication of the patterns of traffic flow in converging areas;\
  \  \n\uF0B7 The organization of safe traffic flow in areas of concentrated offshore\
  \ exploration or \nexploitation  \n\uF0B7 The organisation of traffic flow in or\
  \ around areas where navigation by all ships or by \ncertain  classes of ships is\
  \ dangerous or undesirable;  \n\uF0B7 The reduction of risk of grounding by providing\
  \ special guidance to vessels in areas where \nwater depths are uncertain or critical;\
  \  \n\uF0B7 The guidance of traffic clear of fishing grounds or the organisation\
  \ of traffi c through the \nfishing grounds \". \n4.8.7.  The shipping traffic around\
  \ the New Zealand coast cannot be described as dense in \ncomparison with other\
  \ area s around the world such as Europe and Asia , where IMO -approved \nship routing\
  \ systems are prevalent.  A sample review of recorded automatic identification \n\
  system data for the coastal area between East Cape and Auckland showed that typically\
  \ there \nwere only about 15 ships48 in the area at any one time.  By comparison,\
  \ in the afore -\nmentioned regions the number of ships in such an area would be\
  \ counted in thousands.  \n4.8.8.  When the Rena  was making its approach to the\
  \ port of Tauranga, traffic density was not a \nsafety issue.  There were as few\
  \ as three  other vessels in the immediate area and  none was \nso close to the\
  \ Rena  that it would be considered a factor in the grounding.  Astrolabe Reef was\
  \ \nan obvious navigational hazard to avoid, but it was well charted and the Rena\
  \  crew had \nplanned to avoid it by two nautical miles in their initial passage\
  \ plan.  There are literally \nthousands of other such navigational hazards for\
  \ ships to avoid as they navigate the New \nZealand coast49. \n4.8.9.  A safety\
  \ issue in this case was poor navigational practices rather than the crew being\
  \ \noverwhelmed by traffic density or hampered by difficult navigational conditions.\
  \  Automatic \nidentification system  data showed other prior  incidences  of large\
  \ ships passi ng close to, and \n                                              \
  \          \n47 IMO Resolution A.572(14) and SOLAS Safety of Navigation/Chapte r\
  \ V/Regulation 10.  \n48 Larger vessels that are required to have automatic  identification\
  \ system s fitted, which would exclude \nfishing and private vessels and smaller\
  \ commercial vessels.  \n49 What constitutes a hazard will depend on several factors,\
  \ such as the s ize of the ship, its manoeuvrability \nand the depth it draws. \
  \ \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 49 >>\n even inside , Astrolabe Reef.  Tauranga\
  \ is one of New Zealand's busiest ports, and shipping \ndoes converge near its entrance\
  \ at designated times governed by the state of the tide50.  If \nthere had been\
  \ some form of mandatory ship routing that required ships to stay a safe \ndistance\
  \ off Astrolabe Reef , the Rena 's crew would more than likely have heed ed those\
  \ \nmandatory directions and the grounding would likely have been avoided . \n4.8.10.\
  \  Tauranga is one example where local government could conduct a risk assessment\
  \ to \ndetermine whether implementing a ship routing system off the port is justifiable.\
  \  \n4.9. Aids to navigation  \n4.9.1.  During the inquiry it was put to the Commission\
  \ that Astrolabe Reef should have been marked \nwith a light beacon or some other\
  \ aid to navigation, and that if it had been the grounding \nwould have been prevented.\
  \  To put this argument in context, there are many other safety \nissues identified\
  \ in this report that , had they never arisen, the grounding probably would not\
  \ \nhave happ ened.  Nevertheless the Commission considered this issue.  \n4.9.2.\
  \  The Commission agrees that had there been a light beacon placed on Astrolabe\
  \ Reef it is \nhighly likely that the grounding would have been prevented.  The\
  \ presence of a flashing light \nwould have been a stark indicator to the bridge\
  \ crew that their ship was heading directly for \nAstrolabe Reef, particularly when\
  \ the master noticed the echo of the reef on his radar and \nbegan looking for what\
  \ was causing it.  \n4.9.3.  However, t here are many rocks, reefs and other n avigational\
  \ hazards around the New Zealand \ncoast.  Installing and maintaining navigation\
  \ aids on remote hazards is costly.  Some years ago \nMaritime  New Zealand consulted\
  \ the industry on the need to maintain lighthouses and light \nbeacons around the\
  \ New Zeal and coast.  After that it relocated and automated the main lights \n\
  to both reduce cost and improve their reliability.  \n4.9.4.  Historically coastal\
  \ lights were installed as visual aids to navigation in an era when electronic \n\
  aids to navigation were few and less advanced than the modern GPS and other electronic\
  \ \nsystems that are available today at minimal cost.  \n4.9.5.  Cultural and environmental\
  \ factors related to installing and maintaining aids to navigation \nmust also be\
  \ considered with respect to the Resou rce Mana gement Act 1991.  \n4.9.6.  The\
  \ Rena  bridge was not fitted with a n electronic  chart plotter with a GPS feed.\
  \  Such \nequipment is inexpensive to install and most large ships are fitted with\
  \ it.  An electronic chart \nplotter would have shown at a glance the Rena 's position\
  \ in relation to Astrolabe Reef.  \n4.9.7.  Astrolabe Reef was well  displayed as\
  \ a danger to surface navigation on the chart being used \nby the Rena  bridge team.\
  \  There was sufficient surrounding topography in the vicinity and the \nRena  had\
  \ sufficient bridge navigational eq uipment, even without a chart plotter , to avoid\
  \ \ncolliding with the reef without needing the aid of a light beacon on the reef.\
  \  \n4.9.8.  A more cost -effective option is being trialled by the International\
  \ Association of Marine Aids to \nNavigation and Lighthouse Autho rities  - that\
  \ is , \"virtual aids to navigation \".  In its draft \nguidelines on virtual aids\
  \ to navigation , the International Association of Marine Aids to \nNavigation and\
  \ Lighthouse Authorities  describe s them as \" a virtual aid to navigation [that]\
  \ \ndoes not physically exist but is a digital information object promulgated by\
  \ an authorized \nservice provider that can be presented on navigational systems\"\
  \ .  \n4.9.9.  Simply put , a virtual aid to navigation  is a navigational aid \
  \ that is normally communicated by \nVHF radio sig nal in an automatic identification\
  \ system  message.  A virtual aid to navigation  \ncould be projected on to Astrolabe\
  \ Reef and this would show up as a symbol on a ship's radar \nand other electronic\
  \ navigation equipment set up to receive the signal.  \n                       \
  \                                 \n50 Strong tidal streams in the entrance channel\
  \ restrict the times that ships can transit the channel inbound \nand outbound depending\
  \ on ship size and draft.  \n\n<< Page 50 >>\n Final report 11 -204 4.9.10.  This\
  \ technology will likely in future provide a recognised alternative to physically\
  \ placing lights \nand beacons on navigational hazards.  \n4.9.11.  When researching\
  \ this matter the Commission noted that the re were several examples of \nvirtual\
  \ a ids to navigation  already bei ng used by port companies and regional councils\
  \  near \nport approaches .  Some caution needs to be exercised when using a new\
  \ type of navigation \naid before proper research has been conducted and performance\
  \ standards developed for its \nuse. \n4.9.12.  There is also the m atter of educating\
  \ mariners in the concept of virtual a ids to navigation , and \nthe reliance that\
  \ can be placed on them to navigate ships.  An over-reliance on the accuracy of\
  \ \nelectronic aids to navigation has been causal in many ship groundings over the\
  \ yea rs. \n4.9.13.  The Commission has raised this safety issue with the Director\
  \ of Maritime  New Zealand  in its \nrecommendations.  \nFindings:  \n17. A light\
  \ beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef is another measure that probably would \nhave\
  \ alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of Astrolabe Reef, and \n\
  would likely have prevented the Rena  grounding . However, this needs to be seen\
  \ \nin the context of: \n\uF0B7 the number of other dangerous rocks and reefs around\
  \ the New Zealand \ncoastline  \n\uF0B7 the cost versus the benefit s of fitting\
  \ and maintaining light beacons on all such \nrocks and reefs  \n\uF0B7 the availability\
  \ and prevalent use of more modern and accurate navigation \nsystems for avoiding\
  \ such navigational dangers  \n\uF0B7 further advanced systems such as virtual and\
  \ synthetic aids to navigation that \nare likely to replace physical light beacons\
  \ in future  \n\uF0B7 relevant Resource Management Act considerations . \n18. A\
  \ simple stand -alone chart  plotter or a chart plotter integrated with the radar\
  \ was \na low -cost and effective aid to navigation that would have visually alerted\
  \ the \nRena 's bridge team that the Rena  was tracking directly towards Astrolabe\
  \ Reef . \n19. The use of virtual aids to navigation c ould be one alternative method\
  \ for \nhighlighting dangers to navigation.  However, they should not be introduced\
  \ \nbefore proper research into, and the development of performance standards for\
  \ \nthem have been completed.  \n \n \n  \nFinal report 11 -204 \n<< Page 51 >>"
