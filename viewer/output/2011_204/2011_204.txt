The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate  that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of  implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas.  The pri ncipal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents  and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. The Liberian -registered container ship Rena  had left the New Zealand port of Napier at 1020 
on 4 October 2011 and was bound for the New Zealand port of Tauranga.  The master had 
given an estimated time of arrival at the Tauranga pilot station of 0300 the next day. The 
master calculated the estimated time of arrival by dividing the distance to go by the Rena 's 
normal service speed.  The calculation did not account for the unfavourable  currents that 
normally prevail ed down that stretch of coastline.  
1.2. After departure from Napier the master  learned  from notes on the chart of the unfavourable  
currents.  He then authorised the watchkeepers to deviate from the planned course lines on 
the chart to shorten the distance , and to search for the least unfavourable curr ents.  
1.3. The Rena 's second mate took over the watch shortly after midnight on 4 October.  He 
calculated that the Rena  would arrive at the port of Tauranga pilot station at 0300  at the 
ship's  then current speed.  Times for ships entering and leaving Tauranga H arbour are limited 
by the depth of water and the strength of the tidal currents  in the entrance channel .  Tauranga 
Harbour Control informed the second  mate that the latest time the Rena  could take the 
harbour pilot on board was 0300 .   
1.4. The planned course t o the Tauranga pilot station was to pass two nautical miles north of 
Astrolabe Reef before making the final adjustment in course to the pilot station.   The second  
mate decided to reduce the two miles to one mile in order to save time.  The second  mate 
then made a series of small course adjustments towards Astrolabe Reef to make the shortcut . 
In doing so he altered the course 5 degrees past the required track and did not make an 
allowance for any compass error or sideways "drift", and as a conseque nce the Rena  was 
making a ground track directly for Astrolabe Reef.  Meanwhile the master had been woken 
and arrived on the bridge to prepare for arrival at the port.  
1.5. The master and second  mate discussed preparations for arrival at the pilot station.  The 
master then assumed control of the ship , having received virtually no information on where 
the ship was , where it was heading , and what immediate dangers to navigation he needed to 
consider.  
1.6. During this period of handover no -one was monitoring the position of the ship.  At 0214 t he 
Rena  ran aground at full speed on Astrolabe Reef.  The ship remained stuck fast on the reef 
and in the ensuing months it broke in two.  The aft section moved off the reef and sank.  About 
200 tonnes of heavy fuel oil were  lost to the sea.  A substantial amount of cargo in the 
containers was lost.  The vessel became a total loss  on 11 October 2011 . 
1.7. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) concluded that the Rena  
groundin g was not in any way attributable to the malfunction of any on -board machinery or 
equipment, including on -board navigational equipment.  Factors that directly contributed to 
the grounding included  the crew : 
 not following standard good practice for  planning  and executing the voyage  
 not following standard good practice for navigation watchkeeping   
 not following standard good practice when taking over control of the ship . 
1.8. Safety issues  that the Commission identified in the wider context included:  
 CIEL Shipmana gement  S.A.'s oversight of the Rena 's safety management system was 
not sufficient to prevent a high number of port state control  deficiencies identified 
during two port state control "initial " inspections about three  months prior  to the 
grounding, and routine violation s of some company procedures for voyage planning 
and navigation  
 an independent audit had found that t he Philippine s' maritime education, training and 
certification system did not meet the mandatory standards specified in the Convention 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report 11 -204 on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers  1978  (the 
STCW Convention)  
 the current auditing protocols of the STCW Convention lack the transparency that 
would assist  member states to decide whether other  countries'  training system s meet 
the stand ards of competency required by the STCW Convention, and therefore 
whether to recognise certificates of competency issued by those countries . 
1.9. The report also discusses two other considerations that were raised during the inquiry - 
whether there is a need for ship routing in some form around the New Zealand coast, and how 
far maritime authorities should go in marking hazards to navigation such as Astrolabe Reef .  
The Commission identified two issue s: first, with regard to s hipping,  there is insufficient data 
being collected to make a meaningful analysis of shipping movements around the New 
Zealand coast ; and second ly, with regard to marking hazards, a  new type of "virtual aid to 
navigation" is being used for marking hazards to navigation before this system has been fully 
tested and endorsed by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and 
Lighthouse Authorities.  
1.10.  The Commission made recommendations  to: 
 CIEL Shipmanagement  S.A. to evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management 
system to ensure  that the issues identified with that  system as applied  on board the 
Rena  do not affect other vessels within  its fleet  
 Maritime  New Zealand to promote, through the International Maritime Organi zation , 
the transparency of the system for auditing countries ' seafarer training systems  
 Maritime New Zealand to collect  sufficient data on shipping movements around the 
New Zealand coast, and monitor  and control  the use of virtual aids to navigation 
around the New Zealand coast. 
1.11.  The key lessons  learnt from the inquiry into this accident were:  
 ship managers must ensure that their safety management system s are delivering safe 
ship operations for every ship in their  fleets 
 ships' crews must comply with the mandatory requirements and recommended best 
industry practice for passage planning, navigation and watchkeeping if similar 
groundings and other equally catastrophic  maritime  casualties  are to be avoided  
 countries' maritime education, training and certification systems must be capabl e of 
meeting the standards required by the STCW Convention  to ensure that seafarers 
emerging from the system are trained to an appropriate standard .

 2.  Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The purpose of the Commission's inquiry, as set out in section 4 of the Transpo rt Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990, is to determine the causes  and circumstances  of 
accidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future. The Commission's inquiry 
is not for the purpose of ascribing blame, and its reports cannot b e used in any proceeding by 
or against any person.  
2.2. The Rena  ran aground on Astrolabe Reef at about 0214 on 5 October 2011.  The Rescue 
Coordination Centre New Zealand notified the Commission  of the grounding at 0237 the same 
day.  The Commission immediatel y opened an inquiry into the accident under section 13(b) of 
the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in 
charge.  The accident was a "very serious casualty" as defined in the International Maritime 
Organization  (IMO) Casualty Investigation Code.  
2.3. The scope of the Commission's inquiry was limited to determining the causes and 
circumstances of the grounding.  The inquiry did not consider the subsequent salvage 
operations or the oil spill response.  
2.4. Throughout the fi rst day the Commission gathered information through the Maritime New 
Zealand Emergency Response and Rescue Coordination Centres.  Once it had been 
established that access to the stricken vessel was possible, the chief investigator and 
investigator in charg e travelled to Tauranga to start the site investigation that same day,  
5 October.  
2.5. The state of registry for the Rena  was Liberia.  The Commission notified the Liberian 
International Ship &  Corporate Registry of the accident and offered to conduct the "marine 
safety investigation" on behalf of Liberia.  The IMO Casualty Investigation Code required that a 
"marine safety investigation" be conducted into every "very serious casualty". Liberia e lected 
to appoint an investigator to conduct its own investigation and requested assistance from the 
Commission.  The Commission provided whatever assistance it could under New Zealand law.  
2.6. Both the Director of Maritime New Zealand and the Chief Executive of Bay of Plenty Regional 
Council requested permission to conduct their own investigations at the site of the Rena  
grounding.  The Commission granted permission under section 14(3) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 to the Director  on 5 October and to the Chief Executive on 
7 October 2011.  
2.7. The Commission's investigators boarded the Rena  on 6 October 2011 and interviewed the 
master, the second mate and the watchkeeper (the crew who were on the bridge at the time 
the Rena  grounded).  The investigators re -boarded the Rena  on 7 October and removed 
documents and the computer and portable data module from the voyage data recorder.  
2.8. The crew were evacuated from the Rena  on Tuesday 11 October. On Thursday 13 October  two 
Commission investigato rs returned to Tauranga and conducted second interviews with the 
master, the second mate and the watchkeeper.  They also interviewed the third mate.  
2.9. While salvage operations were underway to remove oil from the Rena , environmental 
conditions were weakening  the vessel's structure, so on Saturday 22 October the 
Commission's investigators re -boarded the vessel and removed a significant number of 
documents and equipment that were pertinent to the inquiry.  Maritime New Zealand was 
conducting its own inquiry int o the grounding independently of the Commission.  The exercise 
to remove the documents and equipment was observed by an investigator from Maritime New 
Zealand to allow Maritime New Zealand and the Commission to formally record the chain of 
custody of the d ocuments and equipment.  
2.10.  The voyage data recorder that had been removed from the Rena  earlier was undamaged and 
valid data was successfully downloaded.  On 10 November 2011 two investigators interviewed 
the master and second mate of the Rena  for a third tim e. 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final report 11 -204 2.11.  This report includes information from the crew interviews, information retrieved from the 
voyage data recorder, information from log books, charts and other documents either removed 
from the Rena  or supplied by the Rena 's owner, and information retrieve d from the automatic 
identification system.  Raw automatic identification system data is transmitted from the vessel 
and recorded by several shore stations. The raw automatic identification system data used in 
this report was provided by a maritime consult ant, Marico Marine NZ Limited, and was verified 
with data from the voyage data recorder.  
2.12.  On 9 December 2011 the Commission approved a draft interim report for circulation to 
interested persons. The interested persons were the master of the Rena , the second  mate of 
the Rena , the third mate of the Rena , the watchkeeper on watch at the time of the grounding, 
the vessel's owner, the vessel's charterer, Maritime New Zealand, Bay of Plenty Regional 
Council, Port of Tauranga Limited  and the Crown Law Office.  The draft report was assessed 
and amended after a consideration of the submissions received from the interested persons .  
The submissions raised a number of matters more relevant to the final analysis that had not 
been addressed in the interim report. The inte rim report was approved for publication on 23 
February 2012, and publicly released on 8 March 2012.  
2.13.  The crew had received their formal training through the Philippines ' training system. A 
delegation from the Philippine administration arrived to meet with t he Commission on 27 
February 2012. The delegation spent three days with the Commission , discussing the scope of 
the inquiry and the Philippine s' maritime education, training and certification system.  
2.14.  On 18 May 2012 two investigators from the Commission tra velled to Tauranga to conduct 
further interviews with the master and second mate.  
2.15.  Maritime New Zealand engaged an expert on marine safety management and IMO's 
International Safety Management Code (ISM code) to review and report on the safety 
management sys tem and compliance with the ISM Code with respect to the operation of the 
Rena  (Dr Anderson).  The Commission obtained Dr Anderson's preliminary reports for Maritime 
New Zealand, but as the legal proceedings were settled out of court, Maritime New Zealand 
terminated his work without his having produced final reports.  The Commission obtained and 
initially used this work in its own enquiries . However, because Dr Anderson's work had never 
been finalised,  and was based on a substantial amount of unverified information , the 
Commission also undertook its own review and analysis of the  raw data to verify or correct 
information as required .  
2.16.  Maritime New Zealand engaged a team of expert navigators  (through The Nautica l Institute in 
Auckland)  to reconstruct 30 of the Rena 's past voyages, as near as practicable using passage 
plans, charts and log book records from the ship.  The Commission obtained the results of this 
work.  The Commission then conducted its own reconstr uctions by using raw data to plot the 
voyages and to verify the plotting undertaken by the expert navigators.  The Commission also 
obtained the original charts from the Rena  that covered  the six most recent coastal voyages of 
the Rena  (in the eight  days leading up to and including the accident voyage).  The record of 
these six voyages had not been erased from the charts .  These charts and the reconstructed 
voyages were used to analyse the functioning of the  safety management system on board the 
Rena  with respect to voyage planning and voyage execution .  
2.17.  Maritime New Zealand engaged an expert on fatigue, sleep and human cognitive performance 
to review and report on those aspects of the Rena 's grounding (Professor Gander).  The 
Commission obtained a co py of Professor Gander's report .   
2.18.  On 8 October 2012 two investigators from the Commission travelled to Manila, Philippines, to 
meet with officials from the Philippine administration and also representatives from various 
training institutes. The investigat ors were in Manila for five days. While there the two 
investigators visited five training institutes and observed the training system first hand.  The 
investigators also had access to various European  Maritime Safety Agency ( EMSA ) audits of 
the Philippine s' training and certification system and its compliance with international 
standards.

 2.19.  During the course of this inquiry investigators from the Commission researched various IMO 
instruments , including the International Convention on Standards of Training, Cer tification and 
Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978  (STCW Convention ).   
2.20.  Information was also sought from CIEL Shipmanagement  S.A. (CIEL  ), the Liberian 
International Ship & Corporate Registry, and the company to which the Rena  was time 
chartered.   
2.21.  On 25 July 2013 the Commission approved a draft final report for circulation to interested 
persons.  
2.22.  The draft final report was sent to the following persons and organisations:  
CIEL; the Maritime Industry Authority (Philippines); the Liberia Maritime Authority; the 
Mediterranean Shipping Company  S.A.; Maritime New Zealand; Bay of Plenty Regional Council; 
Port of Tauranga; IMO; and the m aster, second mate , third mate  and watchkeeper of the 
Rena . 
2.23.  The Commission received and considered substantial submissions from CIEL on 30 November 
2013.  The Commission also received  and considered  submissions from the following persons 
and organisations:  
The Maritime Industry Authority (Philippines); the Liberia Maritime Authority; the 
Mediterranean Shipping Company  S.A.; Maritime New Zealand; and the second mate  (no 
comments).  
2.24.  The submissions were considered and the draft final report was substantially revised and sent 
back to CIEL , the Liberia Maritime Authority , the Maritime Industry Authority (Philippines) and 
IMO for further comment  on 13 May  2014 . 
2.25.  Further submissions were received from CIEL on 6 June  2014.  
2.26.  As a result of  CIEL's  submissions questioning the reliance on Dr Gander's report alone to 
analyse whether fatigue was a factor in the accident, the Commission  sent the relevant raw 
data  to and sought additional advice from human factors specialists at the Australian 
Transport Safety Bureau  (ATSB) .  The ATSB  provided its draft report on 8 August 2014 , which 
was sent to CIEL the same day . The ATSB 's final report was received on 26 August 2014  and 
sent to CIEL on 28 August 2014 . The Commission considered and weighed both reports, 
alongside interviews with crew members and further submissions from CIEL dated 3 
September 2014 , in reaching conclusions on whether fatigue might have been a cause of or 
circumstance in the grounding.  
2.27.  As a result of CIEL's  submissions questioning the use of port state  control data to draw 
inferences about the Rena 's and CIEL 's safe ship management system, the Commission 
sought additional independent advice from Mr Mike Pearson of GBT International about port 
state  data , passage planning and safe ship management systems and how these were 
considered  in its draft  report.  Mr Pearson's report was received on 7 July 2014 and was 
provided to CIEL . The Commission also revised its statistical analysis based on updated 
information provided by CIEL , including  the dates that vessels entered and exited its fleet. The 
Commission also sought clarification on  port state data through  various international 
memoranda of understanding  and then  further considered what , if any,  inferences or broader 
safety issues could be drawn from the revised data on port state deficiencies.  
2.28.  The Commission also heard directly from  legal representatives of CIEL, and its safe ship 
management consultant, in person at a hearing in Wellington on 12 August 2014. Following 
that hearing CIEL made further representations to the Commission by  a letter dated 24 
September 2014.  
2.29.  The Commission  considered all further submissions, including points made orally by CIEL 
representatives on 12 August 2014 , and further submissions received after that date, in 
reaching the findings and recommendation contained in this final report .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Note on terminology  
3.1.1.  A number of terms are used in this report to describe the direction in which a vessel travels 
and the direction in which a vessel is pointing.  A brief description of these terms is given 
below.  
3.1.2.  As part of planning a vessel's passage from one location to another, the planned route will be 
drawn on a chart as a single , continuous line. This line is referred to as the course line.  
3.1.3.  From any position on Eart h, true north is in the direction of the geographical North Pole .  The 
lines of longitude on a nautical chart are aligned to t rue north and true  course  lines are  
expressed in degrees relative to true north.  
3.1.4.  Gyro heading is the direction of a vessel as read  on its gyrocompass (a compass in which the 
direction of true north is maintained by a gyroscope).  If there is no gyrocompass error, the 
gyro heading  and the true heading will be the same.  
3.1.5.  The wind and the waves can cause a vessel to move sideways through  the water, giving a 
resultant water track that is different from its actual heading.  The difference between actual 
heading and a vessel's water track is called leeway.  
3.1.6.  Additionally, the body of water through which a vessel is tracking can be moving due t o current 
and tid al streams , causing the vessel's resultant track in relation to the seabed (ground track) 
to differ from its water track.  The difference between a vessel 's water track and its ground 
track is called set.  
3.1.7.  The difference between a vessel's gyro heading and its ground track will be caused by any set, 
leeway and gyrocompass error.  
3.1.8.  The Rena  was being steered by autopilot for most of the voyage from Napier, including the 
whole period from midnight to the time of the grounding.  The Rena 's autopilot operated off its 
gyrocompass.  The Rena 's global positioning [navigation] system (GPS) recorded the vessel's 
position in relation to the ground and thus calculated the Rena 's ground track.  This report is 
concerned , in part,  with the differenc e between the Rena 's gyro heading, to which the 
autopilot was referenced, and the ground track.  These two sets of data were obtained from 
the voyage data recorder and the automatic identification system.  A description of these can 
be found in the glossary.  
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  The Rena  departed Singapore on 5 September 2011 and called at Fremantle, Melbourne and 
Sydney  before arriving at Bluff in New Zealand on 28 September.  The vessel then called at 
Port Chalmers, Lyttelton and Wellington before arriving at Napier in the early morning of 3 
October.  
3.2.2.  At 0620 cargo operations commenced in Napier.  Cargo operations had no t been completed 
by the time another vessel that had a priority booking for the Rena 's berth arrived off the port. 
The Rena  moved to anchor off the port, where it lay for about 13 hours before it could return 
to the berth and resume cargo operations.  
3.2.3.  Carg o operations in Napier were completed by 0920 on 4 October.  The vessel sailed 
immediately, the pilot disembark ed the vessel at 1006, and the Rena  was at full sea speed at 
1018 .  
3.2.4.  Prior to departure t he master had asked the second mate for an estimated time  for the 
passage to Tauranga, which the second mate had calculated using the vessel's passage plan.  
The master told the shipping agent that the vessel would arrive at Tauranga at 0230.  The 
estimate was based on a vessel speed of 17 knots and keeping to t he passage plan.   Once 
the Rena  had sailed from Napier the master sent his departure report to the charterer.  In that 

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report 11 -204 report he updated his estimated time of arrival to 0300 at the Tauranga pilot station.  This 
was to make an allowance for the actual time  of departure; for time to speed up to full service 
speed; and for time to slow down to pilot boarding speed by the time the ship arrived at the 
Tauranga pilot station.  
3.2.5.  The master modified the vessel's planned passage on the chart to shorten the distance 
around Mahia Peninsula, as seen in Figure 1.  The master handed control of the Rena  to the 
third mate at 1100 as the vessel approached Mahia Peninsula.  The passage plan that was in 
use during the voyage required that the vessel's position be plotted hourly , which was typically 
done using co -ordinates from the GPS.  At times during the voyage the position was plotted 
more frequently than hourly.

3.2.6.  At 1200 on 4 October the second mate took over the bridge watch from the third mate.  The 
master returned to the bridge shortly afterwards and told the second mate to proceed on the 
inshore side of the course lines plotted on the chart that showed the passage plan around 
Mahia Peninsula.  He said this in order to assess the strength and location of any 
unfavourable current (currents were known to flow generally in a southward direction in this 
area).  The master also instructed the second mate to navigate the Rena  either side of the 
course lines on the chart while steaming up the east coast in search of the least unfavourable 
current.  The master did not tell him  how far from the planned course he could deviate.  
3.2.7.  The Rena  rounded Mahia Peninsula at about 1300 and proceeded up the coast. The plotted 
positions were always inshore of the course lines  up to the end of the second mate's watch at 
1600 .  A position plotte d on the next chart used in the passage (NZ55) included a position at 
just over 5 nautical miles inshore of the planned passage.  
3.2.8.  The chief officer took over the watch at 1600, and the track took the Rena  steadily away from 
the coast to re-join the planned course lines at about 1900.  T he vessel then altered gyro 
heading  to round East Cape at about 1930.  The third mate took over the watch again at 
2000.  
3.2.9.  At about 0001 on 5 October the second mate took over the watch again from the third mate.  
The second ma te was supported by a watchkeeper, an able -bodied seaman.  The gyro heading 
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 9 >>
 of the vessel at the time of handover was about 272 degrees.  During the handover discussion 
the third mate reminded the second mate that the passage plan would require an alterati on 
on to the next course line a few minutes later.  
3.2.10.  At about 0014 the Rena 's gyro heading was altered to about 263 degrees.  The ground track 
at this time was about 262 degrees.  The vessel's gyro heading  was progressively altered 
during the following 30 m inutes to bring it to a gyro heading of 267 degrees and a ground 
track of about 265 degrees. In other words the vessel was making 2 degrees to the south of 
the vessel's gyro heading under the influence of set, leeway and gyrocompass error. The 
automatic id entification system data showed that the Rena  was making about 2 degrees to 
the south of the vessel's gyro heading from at least midnight until it grounded on Astrolabe 
Reef.  The Rena 's ground track was approximately parallel to, and about a quarter of a 
nautical mile to the south of, the planned passage until about 0130.  
3.2.11.  At 0015 Tauranga Harbour Control called the Rena  on very-high-frequency  (VHF) radio to 
discuss the vessel's estimated time of arrival and pilot boarding time.  The Rena  told Tauranga 
Harbour Control that its estimated time of arrival at the pilot station was 0300.  Tauranga 
Harbour Control advised the Rena  that 0300 was the end of the time window6 for pilotage, 
and also requested the Rena  to make best speed for the pilot station.  
3.2.12.  Tauranga  Harbour Control called the Rena  again at 0059 to confirm its estimated time of 
arrival at 0300 and ask for the Rena 's arrival draft.  
3.2.13.  Figure 2 shows the Rena 's gyro heading and ground track and the difference between the two.  
This data was taken from the automatic identification system and includes any error from that 
system.  For clarity the data scatter was "smoothed" by taking an average ove r several data 
points.  The bottom axis shows the time of day beginning at 0043 on 5 October 2011 and 
ending at around 0215 the same day.   The vessel's gyro heading and ground track are read 
from the left -hand axis, which shows the gyro heading as recorded  by the automatic 
identification system.  The difference between the gyro heading and the ground track of the 
vessel is read from the right -hand axis.  Some points in the narrative have been superimposed 
on the data for reference.  
3.2.14.  At about 0101 the gyro he ading  was altered to the south by about 1 degree as seen in  Figure 
2. Between 0120 and 0150 the gyro heading and ground track altered a further 10 degrees to 
the sout h, resulting in a gyro heading of about 255 degrees at about 0150.  
3.2.15.  Positions were plotted on the chart at 0100 and again at 0120.  These positions were taken 
from the GPS and plotted by the watchkeeping able-bodied seaman. Vessel positions plotted 
by the able-bodied seaman were then checked by the second mate.  The 0100 position was 
marked on chart NZ54 and the 0120 position was marked on the larger -scale chart NZ541, as 
seen in Figure 3 (Mayor Island to Okurei Point).  However , neither of the charts had both 
positions marked .  In other words no position was transferred from one chart to the other 
when changing charts.  The Rena 's gyro heading was 266 degrees at that t ime and the ground 
track was about 264 degrees, indicating  that the Rena  was making about 2 degrees to the 
south of the gyro heading.  Both of the plotted positions were already south of the course lines  
plotted on the chart.  
                                                        
6 Shipping movements in and out of the port were restricted by the available depth of water and the strong 
tidal currents in the e ntrance channel.

 Final report 11 -204 3.2.16.  The master had placed a mark on the chart, with a written instruction for the second mate to 
call him when the Rena  reached that position.  At 0135 the vessel reached the marked 
position and t he second mate called the master on the telephone.  During the discussion the 
second mate confirmed that the vessel would be at the pilot station by 0300 and also 
discussed an alteration of course that would shorten the distance to the pilot station, to wh ich 
the master agreed. The second mate had already begun to make that alteration progressively 
to gyro heading . 
3.2.17.  The second mate's plan was to navigate closer to Astrolabe Reef.  He said he placed a mark 
on the chart about one nautical mile north of Astrolabe Reef (shown in Figure 3), which was 
the point to which he intended to navigate the Rena  before making the final gyro heading  
adjustment to the pilot station.  
3.2.18.  The second mate said that  he took the Rena 's position from the GPS and marked this point 
with a "pri ck" using a drawing instrument.  He did not mark this position in pencil on the chart.  
The pinprick  mark on the chart was nondescript and was not immediately obvious to anyone 
other than the person who had made it.  
3.2.19.  The Rena 's position was taken again from  the GPS at 0142 and plotted on the chart.  This 
position was plotted by the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman.  At this time the gyro heading 
of the vessel was about 257 degrees, but the ground track was about 255 degrees, meaning 
the vessel was still makin g about 2 degrees southward towards Astrolabe Reef.  
3.2.20.  The second mate set up a parallel index on one of the Rena 's radars at 0142.  He set it up on 
the northern tip of Motiti Island.  The purpose of a parallel index is normally to monitor a 
vessel's progress  as it tracks along its course  lines . In this case if the vessel had deviated 
from the intended course the second mate would have been able to detect this as a relative 
movement between the line on the radar and the radar image of Motiti Island.  By 0150 t he 
Rena 's gyro heading was about 255 degrees, a shift of about 11 degrees from the Rena 's 
heading at 0120, towards Astrolabe Reef.  At 0150 the ground track averaged about 252 
degrees, about 3  degrees  lower  (southwards ) than the gyro heading towards Astrol abe Reef.  
At this point the Rena  was making directly for the reef.  
3.2.21.  The voyage data recorder captured a screenshot of the Rena 's radar at about 15 -second 
intervals. Figure 4 shows a radar screenshot captured at the time the parallel index 
(referencing Motiti Island) was set up. The screenshot has been annotated with labels to 
identify :  
 The course line  alteration waypoint north of Astrolabe Reef given in the passage 
plan 
 The Rena  and its vector showing where it will be in six minutes  
 The radar echo show ing the location of Motiti Island  
 The parallel index lines referenced to Motiti Island . 
3.2.22.  The master arrived on the bridge7 at about 0152.  The master and the second mate had a 
discussion over the radar screen , after which the next waypoint that the GPS was monitoring 
was moved from the one just north of Astrolabe Reef to the one over the pilot station (shown 
in Figure 3).  At 0158 the master removed the p arallel index lines from the radar because he 
thought they were cluttering the radar screen.  The master and the second mate then moved 
into the chartroom behind the wheelhouse and were discussing preparations for the Tauranga 
arrival.  While they were hav ing this discussion, the watchkeeping able-bodied seaman came 
into the chartroom with the intention of plotting the Rena 's 0200 position.  The able -bodied 
seaman read the position off the GPS in the chartroom and recorded it in the position log 
                                                        
7 The bridge included the wheelhouse and the chartroom.  At night the chartroom was normally curtained off 
to preserve the night vision of those on the bridge who were keeping a look -out.

 book.  The master and second mate were leaning over the chart as they talked, so rather than 
interrupt them the able -bodied seaman did not plot the 0200 position on the chart. The 0200 
position was plotted after the grounding and was plotted in a position further nor th than the 
Rena 's position at the time.  The position written in the position log book by the watchkeep ing 
able-bodied seaman was amended to match the 0200 position later plotted on the chart.

3.2.23.  The master discussed the preparation of the pre -arrival documents with the second mate, 
then  went into the wheelhouse to become familiar with the situation of the vessel and monitor  
the radar.  In his submission to the interim  report the second mate said he showed the master 
the charts and pointed out the amended (passage) plan, including the mark one nautical mile 
off Astrolabe Reef. The master said he did not study the charts.  
3.2.24.  At about 0205 the master noticed an intermittent echo on the radar.  The echo was about 2.6 
nautical miles dead ahead of the Rena .  The master showed the echo on the radar to the 
watchkeep ing able-bodied seaman and they used binoculars to look through the wind ows of 
the bridge for the cause of the echo.  They could not see anything, so they moved to the bridge 
wing to look from there.  When again nothing could be seen the master said that he decided to 
plot the Rena 's position on the chart, so began to walk thr ough the wheelhouse to the 
chartroom.  
3.2.25.  At 0214, as the master made his way to the chartroom, the Rena  struck Astrolabe Reef while 
travelling at a speed of 17 knots.  
3.2.26.  The crew reported the grounding to  Tauranga Harbour Control.   The crew made soundings of 
all compartments and established that the ship had suffered major damage with multiple 
compartments breached.  The Rena  remained stuck fast on the reef for the ensuing  months

 Final report 11 -204 and eventually  broke in two while the salvage company that had been appointed worked to 
salvage the ship and its cargo .  About 200  tonnes of heavy  fuel oil were  lost to the sea.  
3.3. Personnel information  
3.3.1.  The master held a current certificate of competency as master mariner issued by the 
government of the Republic of the Philippines in a ccordance with  the STCW  Convention . He 
had a licence of competence for a merchant marine officer (master) issued by the Republic of 
Liberia on 12 December 2007.  The master started his sea -going career as deck cadet  in 
1990 .  He sailed with various shippin g companies , rising up through the various ranks in the 
following 17 years.  He joined CIEL  as first mate in 2007 and sailed on three  of its ships in 
that capacity.  During that period he was formally assessed by the various masters under 
whom he sailed , which included a period of assessment while he was acting as master under 
the guidance of a senior CIEL captain.  Following that last assessment t he master was formally 
promoted and signed on as master of a CIEL container ship in January 2008 .  He  then sign ed 
on to the Rena  as master on 21 November 2010 until 7 February 2011, and again as master 
on 25 March 2011  (see Appendix 2 for a more detailed account of the master's career and 
qualifications) . 
3.3.2.  The second mate (the navigating officer)  began his sea -going career as a deck -boy in 2000 .  
He first served on container ships operated by Costamare  Inc.8 from November 2003.  He first 
signed on as an officer of a container ship operated by CIEL  in late 2009. At the time of the 
grounding the seco nd mate held a certificate of competency as officer -in-charge of a 
navigational watch issued on 28 September 2010 by the government of the Republic of the 
Philippines in accordance with the STCW  Convention .  He had a licence of competence as a 
merchant mar ine officer (navigational watch officer) issued by the Republic of Liberia on 5 
November 2010. He had signed on to the Rena  as an officer in November 2010  (see 
Appendix 2 for a more detailed account of the  second  mate's career and qualifications) . 
3.3.3.  The able -bodied seaman watchkeeping on the bridge at the time of the grounding held a 
current certificate of competency as a deck rating issued by the government of the Republic of 
the Philippines in accordance with the STCW  Convention .   
3.4. Vessel information  
3.4.1.  The Rena was built to American Bureau of Shipping class by Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft in 
Germany in 1990.  At the time of the grounding the Rena  was owned by Daina Shipping Co. of 
Liberia.  The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea  1974  (SOLAS Convention ) 
safety management company was CIEL.  Daina Shipping Co. was owned by Costamare Inc ., 
which was incorporated in the Marshall Islands. The vessel was operating under time charter 
to the Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A. A time charter is  an arrangement whereby the 
owner of the vessel is responsible for managing it, and the charterer directs the vessel's 
trading schedule.  
3.4.2.  The Rena 's general particulars can be seen in  Table 1. 
3.4.3.  Charts that were relevant to the passage from Napier to Tauranga and in use on board the 
Rena  were NZ56, NZ55, NZ54 and NZ541.  
3.4.4.  The bridge navigation and communications equipment installed on board the Rena  is listed in 
Table 3. The S-band automatic radar plotting aid radar, course recorder and depth sounder 
were not in use at the time of the accident.

3.5.3.  MetService said that coastal weather forecasts were valid within 60 nautical miles of the New 
Zealand coastline.  Because most coastal forecast a reas cover some thousands of square 
nautical miles, the forecast only describes in a general sense the expected weather 
conditions.  In small parts of a forecast area (for example, off a particular headland in a 
particular wind flow), weather conditions co uld be significantly different from those forecast.  
3.5.4.  Port of Tauranga had numerous meteorological sensors around the port, which were used to 
produce a picture of the conditions within the port and its approaches .  The prevailing 
conditions at "A" beacon at  the time of the accident were light airs, about one knot 
(0.5 metres  per second) from a south -south -westerly direction, a significant wave height of 
1.16 m etres  and a tide of 1.79 metres .

 Final report 11 -204 3.5.5.  On board the Rena , the last weather observation recorded in the bri dge log book, which was at 
midnight  on 5 October 2011, remarked that there was a clear sky with a moderate breeze and 
sea with good visibility.  The wind was noted as being force 5 (Beaufort notation) (8.75 to 
10.80 metres per second ) from the northwest.  
3.5.6.  The New Zealand Nautical Almanac included Tauranga as a standard port for tidal prediction.  
The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research provided an online service to 
determine the tidal height at any position around the New Zealand coast.  Aft er the grounding 
this service was used to determine the times of high and low water for the actual incident 
location.  The calculated times for high and low water at Tauranga and Astrolabe Reef for 5 
October are shown in Table 4.

3.5.7.  The Bay of Plenty was affected by both ocean currents and tidal streams , and  the p ort of 
Tauranga was a tidal port. Owing to the tidal flow and manoeuvrability of large vessels , Port of 
Tauranga control led entries to  and exit s from  the port with prescribed time window s of 
opportunity for pilotage . The ocean currents and tidal streams to the north and east of New 
Zealand were complex, as described in the admiralty sailing directions of the United Kingdom 
Hydrographic Office 2010:  
… The currents N and E of New Zealand are complex, varying with the seasons; their 
general movement can best be seen on the diagrams.  To the N of North Island the 
South Sub -Tropical Current setting SW meets a current setting E to NE from the 
Tasman Sea.  To SE of South Island the Southern Ocean current extends ENE, 
having rounded Stewart Island.  Off the E coast of New Zealand, between these two 
broad developments, secondary eddies are formed.  In the N part of this area, some 
of the water from Tasman Sea set s SE among the offshore islands and along the 
coast into the Bay of Plenty, before topographical diversion sends some of this water 
NE into the general oceanic drift.  The remainder continues around East Cape, 
thence S to Hawke Bay and on to the entrance o f Cook Strait…  
… Current sets generally S into Bay of Plenty but is not much felt.  In the vicinity of 
East Cape it is SE where part is deflected offshore and the remainder sets generally 
S to the vicinity of Cape Turnagain…  
… Tidal streams along the coast  set W with the flood and are greatly influenced by 
the prevailing conditions, see information on the chart.  Off East Island (37°42'S 
178°35'E), and in the channel W of the island, the rates of the tidal streams are 
much greater than off the open coast.  
3.5.8.  On 5 October 2011, sunrise at Tauranga was calculated to be at 0645.  Moonrise was at 
1150 on 4 October 2011 and moonset was at 0236 on 5 October 2011.  The moon was 
between half -moon and full moon.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The Rena  was travelling at near full speed when it ran aground on Astrolabe Reef.  The ship 
and most of its cargo was a total loss.  This accident was equivalent to what in aviation terms 
is sometimes referred to as controlled flight into terrain - where a fully f unctional aircraft 
[ship] is inadvertently flown [navigated] into the ground by its crew.  
4.1.2.  The Commission found  that no technical or mechanical failure contributed to the accident.  
The ship and its navigational equipment were, or were capable of , functioni ng properly.  The 
crew inadvertently directed the ship on a collision course with Astrolabe Reef.  
4.1.3.  There were a number of acts and omissions on the crew's part that directly contributed to the 
grounding.  They fundamentally involve d the crew not complying w ith some mandatory 
standards for passage planning and watchkeeping standards that are described in the STCW  
Convention .  Those acts and omissions and how they directly contributed to the Rena  
grounding are described in the first two sections:  
 planned passa ge 
 watchkeeping standards.  
4.1.4.  To understand why the crew did what they did and why they were not complying with 
mandatory standards, it is necessary to understand the wider system in which they were 
operating.  Gaps and safety issues within this wider system can contribute to the way a crew 
performs.  With international shipping that system is a complex arrangement between 
international and domestic standards  - in this case domestic standards  for Liberia and the 
Philippines . 
Overview of the international marit ime system  
4.1.5.  International standards are published by IMO.  IMO facilitat es forums, during which member 
states agree through resolutions on various instruments such as conventions, codes and 
guidelines that set or recommend minimum standards covering all aspects of ship design, 
construction and the way ships  are operated.  Conventions are mandatory.  Codes can be 
mandatory or n on-mandatory, depending on the resolution .  If a code is mandatory it becomes, 
in effect , part of any convention to which it relates.   Guidelines are non -mandatory  but are 
generally considered "best practice" .  states elect which IMO instruments  they will adopt .  
Once a s tate signs up to a  mandatory  IMO instrument, it is responsible for adopting the 
standards  in the instrument into  its domestic legislation and checking that ships under it s 
registry comply with them.   Refer to Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5 
Diagram of structure showing IMO instruments  


<< Page 18 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.1.6.  The relevant IMO conventions in this case are the SOLAS Convention  and the STCW 
Convention.  
4.1.7.  The main objective of the SOLAS Convention is to set out minimum standards for the 
construction, equipment and operation of ships, compatible with their safety.  
4.1.8.  The main objective of the STCW Convention is to establish basic requirements for training, 
certification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international level.   
4.1.9.  A relevant IMO code in this case is the ISM Code. The purpose of the ISM Code is to provide an 
international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution 
prevention.   
4.1.10.  A relevant non -mandatory instrument  in this case  is Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines for 
Voyage Planning ( the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines) . These guidelines describe the 
objective, development process, content and end use of a passage plan.  
4.1.11.  Another guideline relevant to this case is Bridge Team Management - a Practical Guide , 
published by The Nautical Institute9. The Nautical Institute is an international representative 
body for maritime professionals involved in the control of sea -going ships. This publication is a 
practical guide that sets out how to prepare and execute a navigational plan . While this  
guideline  is not mandatory, it sets out  industry best practice.  
4.1.12.  The Rena  was owned by a company domiciled in Greece , and it was managed by another 
compan y, CIEL .  The owner placed the Rena  on the Liberia n Registry, and manned the ship 
with Philippine nationals.  
4.1.13.  Liberia was responsible for conducting technical surveys of the Rena  to check  that it was 
maintained to the mandatory national (and IMO) standards.  Liberia could  provide its own 
surveyors to undertake these surveys , but also enter ed into arrangements with  classification 
societies  for their surveyors to undertake the surveys on its behalf (usually once annually).  
Liberia then issue d the Rena  with Liberian maritime documents that acknowledge d that the 
mandatory standards ha d been met at the time of the survey s. 
4.1.14.  The crew on board the Rena  were required to hold Liberian licen ces of competenc e.  Both 
Liberia and the Philippines had signed up to the STCW Convention.  The Philippines had a 
domestic maritime education, training and certification system that wa s required to comply 
with the STCW Convention.  It issued Philippine certificates of competenc e to its seafarers.  
Liberia recognised th e certificates  of competenc e issued by the Philippines  and on that basis 
issued Liberian licen ces of competenc e to seafarers wishing to crew Liberian ships.  
4.1.15.  In compliance with the ISM Code, CIEL was required to have its own safety management 
system (the CIEL safety management system ) to show how its function of day -to-day 
management of its fleet would ensure compliance with all the mandatory technical and 
operational requirements of (in the Rena 's case) Liberian domestic maritime law.  This system 
was subject to external verification10 and both internal and external audits.  When the ISM 
Code was adopted , some Classification Societies added external verification and auditing of 
ISM Code systems to their customer portfolio s.  The CIEL safety management system  in this 
case was verified and audited annually by the Classification Society Germanischer Lloyd on 
behalf of Liberia.  
4.1.16.  Each ship was required to have its own safety management system linked to the parent 
system of its shore management.  Each ship system was also subjected to internal  audit  and 
external verific ation  and audit .  Germ anischer Lloyd also conducted an external pre-audit of 
                                                        
9 Captain AJ Swift, 1993 . 
10 Verification includes pre -audits and assessments of a new system.  The system is later audited, once it has 
been operating for enough time to build up a history that will show whether the system is functioning 
properly.

 the Rena 's safety management system on behalf of Liberia  in November 2010 .  The company 
conducted an internal audit in April 2011 and Germanischer Lloyd conducted an external 
audit and verification of the Rena 's safety management system in May 2011.  
4.1.17.  Port s tate control  is another mechanism for checking the compliance of individual ships  with 
domestic and international requirements .  Any state has the right to inspect any ship entering 
its ports.  Ships can be detained or issued with deficiency notices.  Port state control records 
are available on a regional basis through the applicable port state memorand um of 
understanding organisation s.  The memorand a are between the maritime administrations of 
States in the same region .  They were formed to provide a continuous record of port state 
control in spections, aimed at minimising duplicate inspections being conducted on ships .  
Ship managers, surveyors and auditors sometimes use t he number of deficiencies that are 
found and/ or the number of times a ship is detain ed as an indicator of  the general health of a 
safety management system .  This comes with the broad caveat that  the area s in which a ship 
trades and the veracity of the port state control systems of the states within those areas are 
factor s that should be taken into account.  
4.1.18.  This overview describes the relationship between the international and domestic maritime 
systems and how they interact ed to set and monitor technical and operational standards for 
ships.  The Commission has identified safety issues in the two sections:  
 safety management systems  
 training . 
Other issues raised  
4.1.19.  The Commission also considered two issues that were raised by the industry during the 
inquiry:  
 coastal routing for ships  
 visual aids to navigation, such as lights and beacons.  
4.2. Planned passage  
Safety issue  - The standard of passage planning on board the Rena  often , and in some respects , did 
not comply with the company  safety management system , or with the vessel's safety management 
system , or with the STCW Convention . 
4.2.1.  The p lanning of a ship 's passage from one location to the next is critical to the safe operation 
of the ship.  Poor planning of the passage will increase the risk to the vessel, and therefore the 
likelihood of an accident .  The Commission has reviewed  all aspects of planning and  executing 
a voyage on board the Rena , and compared this with recognised  industry best practice . 
4.2.2.  The CIEL safety management system11 guidelines on passage planning were  extensive and 
specifically reference d and paraphrase d the IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines . 
4.2.3.  The CIEL safety management system  guidelines  state d the need to have the most up -to-date 
charts and publications relevant for the area to be navigated and for the watchkeepers to be 
given all information on navigational hazards, environmental conditions and any other matter s 
that could affect the safety of navigation.  The largest -scale and most appropriate chart was 
required to be used and the chart  was to be marked to highlight the intended path of the ship 
and any special considerations or hazards that the watchkeeper might encounter.  
4.2.4.  However, t he corresponding company passage p lanning form VS.OPS.002  (Appendix 1) was 
not well  suited to implementing the passage planning requirements in the CIEL safety 
management system .  VS.OPS.002 had two parts . The first part was a comprehensive 
checklist for the considerations laid out in the guidelines .  The second part was a form to be 
                                                        
11 Section 10.3 Passage Planning.  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report 11 -204 filled  in with the actual planned passage.  The second part did not have the capacity to cover 
all of the considerations prompted by the checklist.   It recorded waypoint positions, and 
course line  and distance s between waypoints .  It also allowed for some but not all of the other 
information normally seen in a good passage plan . 
4.2.5.  For example , the form did not provide for speed alterations en -route  or under -keel clearance s 
for critical areas .  On the latter point, a generic single space to provide the under -keel 
clearance for the entire voya ge was provided .  Under -keel clearance  is a factor that should be 
considered for eac h leg of the voyage , and highlighted when it becomes , or could become , a 
hazard.  
4.2.6.  Similar ly there was only a single space provided to record the "squat "12 on each page of the 
passage plan .  Ships often transit areas of narrow and shallow water during voyage s, not 
necessarily only when entering and leaving port s.  It is sometimes necessary for ships to 
reduce speed while transiting areas of shallow water to reduce the effects of squat  in order to 
prevent the ship s running aground.  In the passage plan  for the grounding voyage , an arbitrary 
figure of one metre  was recorded for squat.  There is no way of determining the location  on the 
vessel to which this refer red, or what ship's speed was used in  the calculation .  The under -keel 
clearance was recorded as "5 metres minimum" on the first page of the passage plan for the 
accident voyage, and "2 metres minimum" on the second  page.  Presumably these figures 
refer red to the departure from Napier and  the arrival at Tauranga respectively, but this was 
not clear  and t here was no way of knowing whether they include d an allowance for squat or 
the speed of the ship through the water.   The Rena 's draft and available depth of water from 
Napier to Tauranga meant that under -keel clearance was not a critical fac tor, provided the 
ship kept to the passage plan.  Nevertheless, t hese are all factors that should have been  
routinely considered  for each leg of the voyage and the passage plan form should have been  
designed to display such information in a clear and unambiguous way.  
4.2.7.  Environmental conditions , such as prevailing winds, tides and currents , that can significantly 
affect the passage of a ship should be recorded, but the passage plan ning form had no useful 
space to record such comments .   
4.2.8.  In this case, for the accident voyage t he currents were not mentioned or accounted for in the 
passage plan.  Neither the master nor the second mate said they  referenced any document 
other than the nautical chart for information regarding tide and/or currents off the east c oast 
of New Zealand .  Had they done so as part of the ir planning the master would have been 
better informed of the  unfavourable currents for a good part of the passage to Tauranga.  A 
calculation taking account of the current s would have shown  that his exp ectation of reach ing 
the pilot boarding ground  at 0300, before the end of his chosen tidal window , was unrealistic.  
4.2.9.  According to the Rena 's charterer  there was no pressure for the master to make the early -
morning tide , and the master confirmed this .  The  Rena 's charterer  simply needed to know the 
tidal window  in which  the ship would arrive so that it could pre -order labour to work the cargo.  
The pressure the master put on himself and the bridge watchkeepers to achieve the 
unrealistic arrival time was a consequence of miscalculating how long the passage would 
take, and thus miscalculating the time of arrival .  The pressure to achieve this unrealistic 
arrival time  was ultimately what led to the series of ill -thought -out deviations from the passage 
plan, the last of which directly contributed to the grounding . 
4.2.10.  Areas of danger to navigation should be highlighted on the chart as part of planning the 
passage. Not all areas of danger to navigation we re highlighted on the chart, including 
Astrolabe Reef.   In this case , however, highlighting the reef on the chart may not have averted 
the grounding.  The second  mate was aware of its existence13 and the master did not refer to 
                                                        
12 The phenomenon where a ship sinks bodily in the water when travelling at speed.  The effect can be 
enhanced when the distance between the keel and the seabed is small.  
13 The second mate placed a mark on the chart one nauti cal mile north of Astrolabe Reef when planning for 
the final shortcut.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 21 >>
 the chart anyway before takin g over control of the ship .  Nevertheless, it is recommended best 
industry practice and should have been adhered to.  
4.2.11.  The largest -scale chart should be used wherever possible.  A larger -scale chart was available 
(Chart NZ5413: Approaches to Tauranga) for th e area covering the approach to Tauranga .  
This chart was not on board the Rena  and it was not listed on the passage plan form.  The 
chart would have been the next chart that should have been available to use  if the Rena  had 
not grounded . 
Other voyages of the Rena  
4.2.12.  Given these shortcomings, t he Commission looked at whether the deficiencies on this 
accident voyage were evident in any other voyages of the Rena , and whether the safe ship 
management system relevant to the operation of the Rena  had systemic shortcomings.  
4.2.13.  Maritime New Zealand engaged a team of expert navigators  (through The Nautical Institute in 
Auckland)  to reconstruct 30 of the Rena 's past voyages, as near as practicable using passage 
plans, charts and log book records from the  ship.  The Commission obtained the results of this 
work.  The Commission then conducted its own reconstructions by using raw data to plot the 
voyages and to verify the plotting undertaken by the expert navigators. The same master and 
second mate who were on board during the accident voyage were on board for most of the 
voyages that were re -constructed.  The Commission also obtained the original charts from the 
Rena  that covered  the six most recent coastal voyages of the Rena  (in the eight days leading 
up to  and including the accident voyage).  The record of these six voyages had not been 
erased from the charts.  These charts and the reconstructed voyages were used to analyse the 
safety management system on board the Rena  with respect to voyage planning and voyage 
execution . 
4.2.14.  The Commission verified the accuracy of the voyage reconstructions and used this information 
to help understand the quality of passage planning and navigation by the bridge team  during 
those voyages , in comparison with the standards noted  on the accident voyage.   The charts for 
the previous five voyages into and between New Zealand ports before the Rena  departed 
Napier were recovered from the ship.  The markings on these charts had not been erased.  
Consequently it was not necessary to reconstruct those voyages in the manner described 
above.  For the earlier voyages, there was insufficient information to  reconstruct each voyage 
with total accuracy.  For example, not all position fixes the crew might have marked on the 
chart could be recalled - only those that were recorded in the log book (usually GPS 
positions) .  Also, there may have been valid reasons f or deviating from a passage plan, such 
as manoeuvring for the avoidance  of other traffic as required by the intern ational collision 
regulations.  
4.2.15.  Notwithstanding these caveats, f or most of the reconstructed  voyages there were some 
aspects of the planning an d execution that did not  meet the industry best practices required 
by the safety management system  on board the  Rena .  Examples of some of the deficiencies 
were:  
 incorrect chart identification numbers  
 inappropriate charts listed, or required charts not listed  
 some nautical publications were identified, but no information from them brought into 
the passage planning form  
 sometimes magnitude s of squat  and under -keel clearance were given, but there was 
no record of how the se had been  calculated , or to which leg of the voyage they had 
been  applicable  
 the p osition fixing frequency was often only hourly , and often without regard to  the 
vessel 's location  or proximity to navigational hazards  
 the master did not always sign the passage plan  (although t he passage plan for the 
accident voyage was signed  by the master ). 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.2.16.  Some of these examples were  minor or typographical in nature .  Others were more serious.  
CIEL said in its submission that none of these examples directly contributed to the grounding  
and t he Commission agrees.  As mentioned in the caveat above, there could in some cases be 
reasonable explanation s for act s or omission s.  However, the repetitive nature of the acts and 
omissions  from one voyage to the next , and the fact that similar issues wer e evident for the 
most recent  six coastal voyages (including the accident voyage ), indicate that the failures in 
the design and execut ion of the passage plan that le d to the grounding were not one -off 
failures, but indicative of a wider systemic safety iss ue.   
Deviation from planned passage  
Safety issue  - The Rena  crew occasionally deviated from the passage plan  in an ad -hoc manner and 
did not always incorporate those deviations into the plan  - nor did they adequately monitor the ship 's 
progress against the deviation s.  Deviating from the passage plan was one factor directly contributing 
to the grounding.  
4.2.17.  The reconstruction of these other voyages showed occasional  deviations from the passage 
plans, sometimes to shorten the distance s travelled  and at other times possibly for legitimate 
reasons .  It also showed that it was routine for watchkeepers to fix the ship 's position hourly 
and us e GPS only , when  the passage plan s required that position fixes be made using GPS 
and radar, and the master's standing orders stated that  "in coastal waters [the watchkeeper]  
should take fixes on a paper chart at frequent intervals of 10 -15 minutes using more than one 
method".   The master's standing orders for his watchkeepers , therefore, were not consistent 
with the passage plan that the master [ usually ] signed as approved.   
4.2.18.  The passage plans did not always conform with the company's safety management system, 
and the watchkeepers did not always follow the passage plan s anyway.  The passage plan fo r 
the accident voyage was one such example , as was the act of de viating from it . 
4.2.19.  On the accident voyage the master altered the passage plan marked on the chart in order to 
save time rounding Mahia Peninsula.  He then told the second mate to take the Rena  closer 
inshore of the new line he had marked on the chart.  The master also told the second mate to 
take the ship  either side of the planned passage marked on the chart while trave lling up the 
east coast in search of the least unfavourable current.  In doi ng so the master effectively gave 
the second  mate approval  to deviate as far from the planned course as he felt he needed to.  
4.2.20.  The vessel's original planned passage marked on the chart would have taken the Rena  two 
nautical miles to the north of Astrolabe R eef before approaching the pilot station.  The pilot 
window cut -off was 0300 and the Rena  was running close to that cut -off. When allowing for a 
controlled slowing of the ship to a speed at which the pilot could be boarded, they were not 
going to achieve t he window.  The second mate decided to shorten the distance to the pilot 
station by moving the course line  alteration point closer to Astrolabe Reef .  This deviation 
would have saved about one minute14.  His decision to do so was based on pressure he felt to 
reach the pilot station by 0300.   
4.2.21.  There is nothing wrong in principle with deviating from the voyage plan in response  to changes 
in weather or after encoun tering a situation that has not been planned  for. 
4.2.22.  The IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines recommend that "a ny changes made to the plan should 
be made consistent with these guidelines and be clearly marked and recorded ".  They also 
recommend that  if a decision is made during a voyage, or it is "necessary for the ship to 
deviate substantially from the planned route for other reasons, then an amended route shall 
be planned prior to deviating substantially from the route originally planned"15. 
4.2.23.   The ap propriate procedures for any course change would have included the following steps : 
                                                        
14 The second mate was heard on the bridge voice recorder repeatedly calculating the time and distance to 
go to reach the pilot station by 0300.

 1. Plot the new position for the course line  alteration point north of Astrolabe Reef  
2. Plot the vessel's  position  
3. Draw a new line to the new course line  alteration point  north of Astrolabe Reef  
4. Make the alteration o f gyro heading  and closely monitor  the s hip's progress  along 
that track .  The ship 's progress should have been monitored more closely than 
before  the deviation from the passage plan,  given the higher risk created  by the new 
track . 
4.2.24.  The second  mate did none of the above.  T he alteration to the gyro heading  was not a single 
change to the vessel 's heading but rather a progressive change over about 30 minutes.  The 
true course between the pin-prick  he made on the chart  and the new intended alteration point 
one nautical mile north of the reef was about 260 degrees.  
4.2.25.  The incremental alteration to the gyro heading  suggest s that the second mate had not fully 
considered what the new gyro heading  would be.  While altering the vessel 's heading (set by 
the automatic pilot) the second mate  went 5 degrees past the 260 -degree required track and 
he did not account for set, leeway or gyrocompass error.  The deviation was done in an ad -hoc 
manner and no consideration was given as to ho w the Rena 's progress would be measured 
against the amended plan.  Once the vessel's heading had stabilised on about 2 55 degrees at 
about 0150 the Rena  was heading for a collision with Astrolabe Reef, and the crew were not 
aware of the imminent danger.  
Findings:  
1. The Rena  grounding was not in any way attributable to the malfunction of any 
on-board machinery or equipment, including on -board navigational equipment.  
2. The Rena 's passage plan from Napier to Tauranga on the accident voyage did 
not meet the stand ards documented in the CIEL safety management system  or 
the IMO Voyage Planning  Guidelines .  Nor did it meet best industry practice as 
documented in  The Nautical Institute 's Bridge Team Management - A Practical 
Guide . 
3. The second  mate deviated from the pass age plan to take the Rena  closer to 
Astrolabe Reef to save time.  The deviation unnecessarily increased the risk of 
the ship running aground  and directly contributed to the grounding.  
4. The Rena  grounded on Astrolabe Reef because the bridge crew progressivel y 
adjusted the automatic pilot to an incorrect heading and without making 
allowance for any leeway, set or gyrocompass error.  The resultant ground track 
took the ship directly over the reef.   Not monitoring the progress of the ship 
against the deviation contributed directly to the grounding.  
5. The failure of the crew to follow industry best practice guidelines  for making and 
executing the passage plan on the accident voyage  was not an isolated case .  A 
review of previous voyage plans revealed a number of acts and omissions similar 
to those made on the accident voyage.

 Final report 11 -204 4.3. Watchkeeping standards  
Safety issue  - The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena  for the accident voyage and 
particularly the watch period during which  the grounding  occurred , in almost all  respects , did not 
comply with the industry best practice described in the IMO Voyage Planning G uidelines  and The 
Nautical Institute 's Bridge Team Management - a Practical Guide . 
4.3.1.  The master and the watchkeepers had the prime responsibility for navigating the ship from 
one point to the next in accordance with the passage plan.  The previous section discusse d 
the passage plan and how in this case it was flawed  in several ways and was not adhered to .  
However, the se factor s alone need not have resulted in the Rena  running aground.  
4.3.2.  If the watchk eeping on the bridge that night had  met the required standards  and followed 
industry best practice , the ground ing would probably  not have occurred .  The Rena  would 
probably  have passed  one mile north of Astrolabe Reef as the second  mate intended.  The 
following section discuss es how that went wrong.  
Monitoring the ship's progress  
Safety issue  - The crew were not adequately monitoring and fixing the Rena 's position as the ship 
approached Astrolabe Reef and the port of Tauranga.  
4.3.3.  It is important that a watchkeeper be fully aware of where a ship is at all times, and be (for 
example)  fully aware of all factors that affect the ship's progress , or are likely to in the 
immediate  future.  Knowing about e nvironmental factors such as wind, sea, current and tide  is 
important - so too is knowing the status of the navigation equipment used to d irect and 
monitor the progress  of the ship.  This is often  referred to as the watchkeeper maintaining 
"situational awareness ". 
4.3.4.  Some factors such as current and tide can be predicted and countermeasures taken to offset 
their estimated effect s. Frequently plotting  and monitor ing of a ship's position is k ey to 
knowing the resultant effect of all these factors on the ship's progress.  The closer the ship is 
to navigational hazards, the more often the ship's position should  be checked.   It might be 
reasonable to  plot the ship's position hourly when crossing an ocean (deep sea) because the 
ship deviating off the track is not immediately critical.  When navigating a narrow channel, the 
ship's position should be monitored continuously, because the slightest deviatio n can result in 
its grounding.  When navigating a coast, the frequency of position  fixing should be somewhere 
in between, depending on the closeness of  the intended track  to navigational hazards.   This 
practice  was reflected in the Rena  master 's standing orders , in the IMO Voyage Planning 
Guidelines , and in the safety management system  on board the  Rena . 
4.3.5.  The STCW Convention requires that the situation be fully appraised to manage the "risk of 
collision, stranding and other dangers to navigation "16.  In particular, the STCW Convention 
states  that17: 
 during the watch, the gyro heading  steered, position and speed shall be checked at 
sufficiently frequent intervals, using any available navigational aids necessary, to 
ensure that the ship follows the planned course  
 the officer in charge of the navigational watch shall have full knowledge of the location 
and operation of all safety and navigational equipment on board the ship and shall be 
aware and take account of the operating limitations of such equipment  
 officers of the navigational watch shall make the most effective use of all navigati onal 
equipment at their disposal.

 4.3.6.  The IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines recommend that  "the progress of the vessel in 
accordance with the voyage and passage plan should be closely and continuously 
monitored"18. 
4.3.7.  The CIEL safety management system  guidelines state that , "when the vessel is navigating in 
coastal waters the primary responsibility of the [watchkeeper] is to ensure that the ship is 
following the predetermined passage plan by fixing the position of the vessel and whenever 
circumstances permit, he must use more than one fixing method, such as three bearing lines, 
radar ranges/bearings and instant readout s of one of the electronic position system s e.g. 
LORAN, GPS"19. 
4.3.8.  However,  despite the various guidelines and  company  instructions to the contrary,  it had 
become routine on board the Rena  for the position to be , in the most part , fixed only hourly , 
and usually on the hour , as shown by the reconstruction of previous  voyages.  The coastal 
passage from Napier to Tauranga  on the accident voyage  was no different  up to the point 
where the second  mate ad justed the course to cut the corner north of Astrolab e Reef .  Except 
for one position fix , GPS was the only method used to fi x the Rena 's position .  
4.3.9.  On the morning of the grounding t he position was fixed hourly until the watchkeeping able -
bodied seaman placed a GPS fix on the chart at about 0120, before the deviation from the 
planned passage; then again at about 0142.  When the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  
entered the chartroom to do the hourly position fix at 0200 , the master and the second mate 
were standing in front of the chart.  The watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  could not access 
the chart and would not interrupt the master or second mate , so this position was never 
plotted on  the chart.  Had the position been  plotted , it would have shown that the Rena  was 
tracking toward Astrolabe Reef, and the grounding may have been averted . 
4.3.10.  The watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  was the designated "look -out" and should not 
therefore have been engaged in any other tasks that could affect his ability to keep a good 
look-out.  The STCW Convention says, "the look -out must be able to give full attention to the 
keeping of a proper look -out and no other duties shall be undertaken or assigned which could 
interfere with that task"20. It is not necessarily unsafe for the look-out to be assigned to other 
tasks if the responsibility of look-out is taken over by someone else.  However, i n this case 
there was no -one acting as look-out while the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  made the 
position fix.  
4.3.11.  Given that Astrolab e Reef was submerged and unlit , this deficiency did not in itself have a 
causative influence on the grounding.  The deficiency did , however , reflect the general 
systemic failures on the vessel . 
Using bridge equipment effectively  
Safety issue  - The watchkeeper was not making the most effect ive use of the bridge navigation 
equipment on board the Rena  before the grounding.  
4.3.12.  The STCW Convention says that , "officers of the navigational watch shall make the most 
effective use of all navigational equipment at their disposal"21.  The STCW Convention 
standard was reiterated in the master's standing orders, which said , "All bridge equipment [is] 
always at your disposal and must be used to their optimum, as per makers instructions for 
use" . 
4.3.13.  The Rena 's radar had automatic radar plotting aid capability  and a  feature that enabled maps 
and the location s of hazards to navigation to be programmed into the radar.  This feature was

<< Page 26 >>
 Final report 11 -204 not used by the Rena 's crew on the accident voyage.  Any such features programmed into the 
radar would  have  show ed on the radar screen.  It would have been a simple task to  program 
the position of Astrolabe Reef into the radar.  This action would almost certainly have 
prevented the grounding because the radar was the first equipment that the master used 
when he took control of the bridge.  Astrolabe Reef would have been clear ly shown on the 
radar as being directly ahead of the ship.  
4.3.14.  Parallel indexing is another effective use of the radar to monitor continuously the progress of a 
ship in relation to a known hazard .  The second mate set up parallel indexing on the radar .  
Howev er, the settings were continuously adjusted during  the several minutes that it was in 
operation.  The voice recording from the voyage data recorder suggest ed that  the second mate 
was demonstrating to the watchkeeping able -bodied seaman  how parallel indexin g worked,  
rather than actually  using the parallel indexing to monitor  the Rena 's progress against the  
intended course .  Had the second mate used the parallel index to monitor the Rena 's progress  
against the intended course after he deviated from the passage plan towards Astrolabe Reef, 
it would have shown him that the Rena  was drifting toward s Astrolabe Reef under the 
influences of leeway, set, tide and any compass error.  
4.3.15.  Finally, the second  radar was not switched on.   There are two reasons for it being  good 
practice to have both radars switched on when approaching a port .  First, it is a time when two 
people are involved in navigating the ship - one controlling and the other monitoring.  The 
second reason is that the radars work on different bandwidths (frequenc ies), and therefore 
between the two radars there is an increased chance of detecting a faint target , such as 
Astrolabe Reef just on the sea surface.  
Monitoring compass error  
Safety issue  - The compass error was infrequently checked and was not checked at all on the voyage 
from Napier to Tauranga.  
4.3.16.  A ship's compasses are princip al pieces of navigational equipment and they have an inherent  
margin of error.   Knowing the error in each  is critical to safe navigation, particularly when 
navigating close to hazards and in narrow channels.  
4.3.17.  The STCW  Convention  says that the "standard compass error is to be determined at least once 
a watch [ six times daily]  and when possible, after any major alteration of gyro heading ; the 
standard and gyro -compasses are to be frequently compared and repeaters are to be 
synchronized with their master compass "22. It will not always be possible or practicable to 
achieve these standards and they were developed for  when ships had a greater reliance on 
the magnetic compass as opposed to the gyrocompass .  Nevertheless, the conditions on the 
voyage from Napier to Tauranga did allow compass errors to be obtained.  It would appear 
from the data analysed that the consiste nt drift southward of the gyro course being steered, 
toward Astrolabe Reef , was in part attributable to gyrocompass error.  
4.3.18.  The log book and compass error book show ed that the compass error on  board the Rena  was 
usually determined fewer  than four times a day, and often only once or twice. The compass 
error was not checked at all  during the passage from Napier to Tauranga.   It is important to 
know the gyrocompass error , because it is the gyrocompass that the automatic pilot uses to 
control the heading of th e ship.

 Taking control of the ship  
Safety issue  - There was no clear delineation of who had control of the Rena  at the time of the 
grounding, and the master, having assumed that he had taken control, had received virtually no 
information on where the ship was , where it was heading and what immediate dangers to navigation he 
needed to consider.  
4.3.19.  Handing over the watc h between watchkeepers, and to and from the master , is a very 
important process.  The importance of the master (in this case) being totally aware of the 
situation cannot be overstated .  As with all other aspects of watchkeeping, this was well 
covered in th e STCW Convention  and the CIEL safety management system  procedures.  
4.3.20.  The STCW Convention states , "Prior to taking over the watch, relieving officers [in this case the 
master] shall satisfy themselves as to the ship 's estimated or true position and confirm its 
intended track, [gyro heading]  and speed, and [engine] controls as appropriate and shall note 
any dangers to navigation expected to be encountered during their watch "23. 
4.3.21.  The STCW Convention  goes further in saying  (in part) , "Relieving officers shall personally 
satisfy themselves regarding the:  
 standing orders and other special instructions of the master relating to navigation 
of the ship;  
 position, gyro heading , speed and dra ft of the ship;  
 prevailing and predicted tides, currents, weather, visibility and the effect of these 
factors upon [ground track]  and speed;  
 navigational situatio n, including but not limited to: the operational condition of all 
navigational and safety equipment being used  or lik ely to be used during the watch; 
the errors of gyro - and magnetic compasses; and the conditions and hazards likely 
to be encountered during the watch ". 
4.3.22.  The master arrived on the bridge at about 0152, which was 22 minutes before the Rena  
struck Astro labe Reef.  He had a discussion over the radar screen  with the second mate.  The ir 
discussion was about  whether they were going to be in time to pick up the pilot, and preparing 
the ship for arrival at the pilot station.   They did not discuss the Rena 's po sition, the deviation 
from the course line or the location of Astrolabe Reef .  Nor did  the master study the chart.  
4.3.23.  The master gave the second  mate the task of preparing pre -arrival documentation and then  
began  control ling the ship.  The second mate assumed  that the master had taken control, 
then worked in the chartroom preparing the documentation.  
4.3.24.  The master later said that he had had confidence in the second  mate's watchkeeping  ability, 
and had assumed that the ship was in a safe position.  The radar navig ation system was 
changed to monitor  the pilot station arrival navigation waypoint  when neither the second  mate 
nor the master was aware that Astrolabe Reef lay between the Rena  and that destination.  
This non -adherence to standard practice for handing over  the watch (or conduct of the ship) 
was the last active failure that contributed to the grounding.  It was the last opportunity for 
realising the peril the ship was in.  
4.3.25.  The master acknowledged that he had (in his own mind) taken control of the ship when he set 
the second  mate another task.  He also said that he  had assumed the second  mate would 
continue to monitor the progress of the ship.  It is difficult to understand h ow the second  mate 
could have monitored progress  when he had just been given another task that would require 
his full attention.     
                                                        
23 STCW  Convention A -VIII/3 Taking over the watch.  

<< Page 28 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.3.26.  On this issue the STCW Convention says, "the officer in charge of the navigational watch shall 
continue to be responsible fo r the safe navigation of the ship, despite the presence of the 
master on the bridge, until informed specifically that the master has assumed that 
responsibility and this is mutually understood"24. 
4.3.27.  On this issue the CIEL policy says , "Even if the master is present [on the bridge], continue 
being responsible for the safe navigation of the vessel until such time as the master expressly 
informs [the watchkeeper] that he takes the [control]  of the vessel"25. 
4.3.28.  Although there was no formal wa tch handover it was assumed by both the master and the 
second mate that the master was in control of the vessel, even though the master did not 
expressly say so.  There should have been a formal verbal exchange between the master and 
the second  mate acknow ledging that the master had taken control (and responsibility) for the 
navigation of the ship.  If the master had acknowledged that responsibility it may have 
prompted him to seek more information before taking control of the vessel.  
Findings:  
6. The standard  of watchkeeping on board the Rena  for the  accident voyage, and 
particularly for the watch  period during which  the grounding  occurred , in almost 
all respects did not comply with the requirements of  the STCW Convention , the 
IMO Voyage Planning Guidelines, the CIEL safety management system  or 
industry best practice described in The Nautical Institute 's Bridge Team 
Management  - a Practical Guide.   
7. The Rena 's crew were not following company procedures with respect to  
monitoring the progress of the ship in rela tion to known dangers to navigation for 
the entire voyage from Napier to the time of the grounding.  A failure to monitor 
adequately the progress of the Rena  contributed directly to the grounding.  
8. The second  mate was not making the most effect ive use of th e bridge navigation 
equipment on board the Rena  before the grounding - had he done so either  he 
or the master would have been alerted to the presence of Astrolabe Reef in time 
to avert the grounding.  
9. The master assumed control of the Rena  when the ship was  tracking directly for 
Astrolabe Reef.  There was no clear delineation of who had control of the Rena  
at the time of the grounding, and the master, having assumed that he had taken 
control, had received virtually no information on where the ship was , where  it 
was heading , and what immediate dangers to navigation he needed to consider.

 4.4. Fatigue  
4.4.1.  Fatigue in maritime operations is a safety issue that the IMO has been addressing through its 
various instruments for many years.  The Rena  had called at five New Zealand ports in six 
days.  The grounding occurred at 0214 on the eighth day.  These circumstances prompted the 
Commission to consider whether fatigue could have been a factor contributing to the 
grounding.   
Safety issue  - The perfo rmance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at 
least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight to 0215, the period leading up to the 
grounding.  
4.4.2.  The STCW Convention A -VIII/1 Fitness for duty requires that all perso ns who are assigned duty 
as officers in charge of a watch, or as ratings forming part of a watch, shall be provided with a 
rest period of not less than 10 hours in any 24 -hour period, and 77 hours in any seven -day 
period.  
4.4.3.  The hours of rest may be divided i nto no more than two periods, of which one shall be at least 
six hours in length, and the intervals between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 
hours.  
4.4.4.  The hours of rest must be recorded in a standardised format to allow monitoring and 
verificat ion of compliance with the provisions of the STCW Convention A -VIII/1 Fitness for duty.  
4.4.5.  The Rena 's master was not a designated watchkeeper.  The officer -of-the-watch function was 
shared by the first, second and third mates.  A review of the second mate's n ormal 
watchkeeping schedule and his actual hours of work in the 72 hours prior to the grounding 
showed that his work/rest routine was compliant with the STCW Convention.  
4.4.6.  The hours of rest for the crew of the Rena  were analysed by an expert in fatigue, sleep and 
human cognitive performance (Professor Gander) using the recorded hours of rest as the 
primary source of data.  The recorded hours of rest data was supplemented with post -accident 
crew interviews and a revi ew of other verifying records.  
4.4.7.  Professor Gander's analysis was limited by the data available, and there was some uncertainty 
in that data.  There were some inconsistencies between the recorded hours of rest and the 
known and/or claimed actions of the crew  or vessel.  For example , the recorded hours of rest 
indicate d that on the day of the grounding the master was awake from midnight until the 
grounding, although during interviews the master claimed to have been awoken by the 
telephone call from the bridge at about 0135.  
4.4.8.  The Commission also engaged the ATSB to provide a human factors report, commenting on 
whet her fatigue could have been  a factor contributing to the grounding . 
4.4.9.  The ATSB report made the following statement on the limitations of its analysis:  
"Evaluation of fatigue requires consideration of many factors.  Hours of sleep is a 
primary determinant, as is time of day of both sleep and work.  These factors were 
considered in this analysis.  However, limited data was available regarding:  
 quality of s leep 
 workload and/or sustained attention  
 level of adaptation to split -schedule rosters and length of time on the current 
schedule  
 use of fatigue countermeasures  
 subjective alertness levels  
 sleep disorders  
 other physiological factors such as nutrition, gene ral health, use of caffeine or 
other stimulants, etc  

<< Page 30 >>
 Final report 11 -204 This analysis considered the potential for fatigue impairment. It did not consider 
whether fatigue contributed to any event or actions.  Such an analysis would require 
consideration of factors such as er ror types and their established association with 
fatigued performance, and the extent to which there are alternative explanations for 
the actions.  It also must be noted that the effect of restricted sleep on performance 
is highly individualised, meaning t hat modelling outcomes will never represent a 
perfect fit for any one person.  
Further, noting that the unique requirements of merchant shipping operations 
frequently require changes to planned work and sleep schedules, the assumptions 
of consistent sleep and work patterns built into this analysis are likely to represent a 
more favou rable outcome than was the case. " 
4.4.10.  Four questions to decide whether fatigue was a contributing factor to the grounding  were  
considered .  The questions were as follows:  
At what time did the grounding take place?   
The grounding occurred at about 0214.  Profes sor Gander said that at this time in the body 
clock circadian cycle , "the functional capacity of the crew would be expected to be close to 
its daily minimum and physiological sleepiness close to its daily maximum" .  The ATSB 
report noted  that the time the grounding occurred was "highlighted as a risk factor" when 
using the biomathematical fatigue prediction software , Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool 
(FAST)26. 
Was the crew's normal circadian rhythm disrupted?   
Although the master was not schedu led to work nights, the master had been on duty for 
each of the three preceding nights.  Professor Gander said , "… it is reasonable to conclude 
that his normal circadian rhythm was disrupted." Professor Gander also said that the 
second mate's duty period " required displacing his sleep from the optimal time in the 
circadian body clock cycle, thus it is reasonable to conclude that his normal circadian 
rhythm was disrupted" . 
However, the ATSB  noted that "a key consideration of fatigue assessments is the extent  to 
which a person has been able to adapt to a specific schedule. It would appear that the master 
had no fixed schedule, making the extent of adaptation difficult to assess.   However, it is 
possible that some level of adaptation could occur to a split -shift schedule that could give less 
adverse results" . 
For the second mate, the ATSB added, "the time -of-day factor result must be interpreted 
cautiously as it does not account for the second mate's adaptation to this night time watch, 
which will be determined by the length of time he had been operating on this schedule, 
amongst other individual factors" . 
For h ow many hours had the crew been awake at the time of the grounding?   
The master was asleep in his cabin until the second mate telephoned him at about 0135 , 
and at the time of the grounding he had been awake for about 38 minutes.  Professor 
Gander said that "extended wakefulness was thus not a factor" . However, immediately 
after being awoken from sleep a person will have a transitional period of reduced task  
performance.  This condition is known as sleep inertia.  Professor Gander said that the 
master "could have been experiencing cognitive impairment associated with sleep inertia 
                                                        
26 FAST is underpinned by the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue and Task Effectiveness model, which asserts that (a) a 
circadian process infl uences both performance and sleep regulation, and (b) sleep regulation is dependent 
on hours of sleep, hours of wakefulness, current sleep debt, the circadian process and fragmentation 
(awakenings during a period of sleep).  The ATSB preferred the FAST mod el over the Prior -Sleep -Wake model 
as it took consideration of time of day and sleep quality effects.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 31 >>
 when he initially responded to the telephone call from the bridge.  Sleep inert ia effects 
would be expected to have dissipated by the time of the grounding" . The second mate had 
been awake for a little over two hours at the time of the grounding, so Professor Gander 
said extended wakefulness was not a factor.  
In respect of sleep ine rtia, the ATSB report commented , "the severity of sleep inertia can 
be influenced by the duration of the prior sleep, but more significantly by the sleep stage 
prior to awakening.  If woken from slow -wave sleep, sleep inertia will be more severe than if 
woken from stage 1 or 2 sleep  (Tassi P. &., 2000) .  To that extent, if an individual is 
carrying a sleep debt, and is therefore more likely to be in a deep (slow -wave) sleep, there 
is an increased risk for sleep inertia upon wakening".  
The ATSB report commented further, "severity of sleep inertia effect s have also been 
shown to be related to time of day of awakening.  That is, if woken during the period of the 
circadian trough (approximately 0200 to 0600), the effects of sleep inertia may be more 
severe.  Further, sleep inertia has been found to last fro m as little as 1 minute, to up to 4 
hours.  In the absence of major sleep deprivation however, sleep inertia effects rarely 
exceed 30 minutes  (Tassi, P., Muzet, A, 2000) .  Without access to information regarding 
the quality of the master's preceding sleep episode, or his alertness levels on waking, it is 
difficult to assess the likelihood of the severity or duration of sleep inertia effects".  
Does the 72 -hour sleep history suggest a sleep debt?  
Professor Gander said  the 72 -hour history suggests that the master and the second mate 
had "minimal opportunity for night time sleep in that time and are therefore likely to have 
been experiencing the cumulative effects of sleep debt" . The master did not have a 
minimum rest period of six h ours on any of the six days preceding the grounding.  
Where the data for certain periods conflicted, the A TSB conservatively gave priority to the 
reported sleep, and where there were gaps in the evidence it assumed that sleep was 
consistent with the person' s "usual " sleep periods.  
The ATSB report said that based on the evidence provided, " Rena 's master reportedly obtained 
about 11 hours of sleep in the 24 hours leading up to the grounding (that is, from 0200 on 4 
October) and about 15 -½ hours of sleep in the  48 hours prior (from 0200 on 3 October). The 
second mate reportedly obtained about 8 -½ hours of sleep in the 24 hours prior to the 
grounding and about 18 hours of sleep in the 48 hours prior. If these sleep estimates are 
accurate, based on the prior sleep -wake model, this suggests that neither the master nor the 
second mate were at risk of significant  performance impairment (emphasis added) attributable 
to fatigue during the watch period preceding the accident".  
The ATSB report said that when considering t he master's five-day work/rest pattern, the FAST 
analysis demonstrated that "during most of the work periods reported between 2 October and 5 
October, the master's performance was likely to have been at least  mildly  affected by fatigue  
(emphasis added) . During the work period 2200 on 3 October to 0300 on 4 October, the FAST 
program indicated that the master's fatigue risk reached an 'unacceptably' high level (red 
zone27), by the end of the shift, with time of day, recent sleep length and accumulated sleep  
debt all highlighted as risk factors for this period ".  
The ATSB report said that when considering the second  mate's five-day work/rest pattern, the 
FAST analysis highlighted that his schedule of work and sleep placed him at, at least, a mild to 
moderate risk for fatigue -impaired performance.  Further, "that for each of the second mate's 
watch periods, his fatigue risk was within the yellow zone28, and over the course of each of the 
0000 to 0600 work periods, his predicted effectiveness fell below the dotte d criterion line,

 Final report 11 -204 Specifically, for the period preceding the grounding, the second mate's cognitive effectiveness 
has been assessed as being within the yellow zon e, with time of day being highlighted as a risk 
factor ".  
4.4.11.  The terminology used by the FAST software developers refers to the yellow zone and then the 
dotted criterion line within the yellow zone.  Entering the yellow zone starts occurring during 
the night when someone is missing an entire night's sleep.  That is, a watchkeeper may start 
drifting into the yellow zone as they start not getting their normal sleep.  If they go a whole 
night without sleep (awake for 24 hours) they will fall below the dotted crit erion line  within the 
yellow zone .  As a watchkeeper approaches the time that they would normally sleep on the 
second night (effectively 40 hours without sleep) they will begin to enter the red zone.  
4.4.12.  Figure 6 shows a sample screenshot for a watchkeeper who  begins with normal sleep and no 
work ( green zone) , then data is entered for obtaining no sleep in successive days.

4.4.13.  The Commission considered the reports of Dr Gander and the ATSB.  The methodology used in 
each was different, but both agree d that t he extent to which fatigue contributed to the 
grounding was difficult to quantify.  The ATSB said that t he FAST analysis of the work/sleep 
evidence showed  that both the master 's and the second  mate's performance was at least 
mildly affected by fatigue .  The ATSB  also said that their actions and omissions on the night of 
the grounding were consistent with fatigue.  However , those same actions and omissions  were 
occasionally demonstrated throughout the Rena 's voyages as discussed earlier in this report.  
For example , the lack of cross -checking information during the watch handover from second 
mate to master on the morning of the grounding was consistent with fatigue, but it was also 
consistent with typical watch handovers between the second mate and the master on other 
voyages.  
4.4.14.  The effect s of sleep inertia could have been significant for the master, particularly when he 
answer ed the wake -up call from the  second  mate at 0135 and agreed to his deviating from 
the passage plan  to save time, and again when he first arrived on the bridge and began 
assuming control of the ship from the second mate.   However , as the experts note d above , 
this is difficult to determine without evidence of the sleep stage from which he was woken at 
0135.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 33 >>
 4.4.15.  The FAST analysis show ed that both the master and the second mate were at risk of their 
cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue at times during th e 72  hour period before the 
grounding.  However, their actual  level s of impairment are difficult to quantify without having 
more information on the seven factors mentioned in the ATSB 's "limitations in analysis " 
mentioned above ( paragraph 4.4. 9).  The accu racy of that information was either questionable 
or not available to the Commission.   Consequently, it was not possible to determine whether 
their actions leading up to the grounding were attributable to fatigue.  
Findings:  
10. The master's work and sleep schedule in the three days preceding the accident 
placed him at risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by fatigue.  The 
combination of the effects of time of day for sleep and work, sleep duration , and 
sleep fragmentat ion acted to create significant sleep debt.  
11. The second mate's work and sleep schedule in the three  days before the 
accident meant that there was , at least , a mild to moderate risk of his cognitive 
performance being impaired by fatigue.  
12. The performance of b oth the master and the second mate was likely to have 
been at least mildly affected by fatigue during the work period midnight  to 0215, 
the period leading up to the grounding , but t here  was insufficient eviden ce to  
determine whether  their actions leading u p to the grounding were attributable to 
fatigue.  
4.5. Safety management system  
Background  
4.5.1.  A number of very serious maritime accidents that occurred during the late 1980s  were 
manifestly caused by human errors, with management faults also identified as contributing 
factors.   In response , the ISM Code  was developed and made mandatory by Chapter IX of 
SOLAS29. 
4.5.2.  The ISM Code  requires a safety management system to be established by the "ship owner or 
any person who has assumed responsibility for the ship".  The objectives of the ISM Code are 
to ensure safety at sea, the prevention of human injury or loss of life, and the avoida nce of 
damage to the environment, in particular to the marine environment and to property.  
4.5.3.  The ISM Code says that the safety management objectives of the company should, inter alia:  
 provide for safe practices in ship operation and a safe working environmen t 
 establish safeguards against all identified risks  
 continuously improve safety management skills of personnel ashore and aboard ships, 
including preparing for emergencies related both to safety and environmental protection.  
The ISM Code  also says that the safety management system should ensure:  
 compliance with mandatory rules and regulations  
 that applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the Organization, 
Administrations, classification societies and maritime industry organiza tions are taken into 
account.  
                                                        
29 International Safety Management Code Resolution A.741(18) as amended by MSC.104(73), MSC.179(79), 
MSC.195(80) and MSC.273(85 ). 
 

<< Page 34 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.5.4.  The ISM Code further says that in order to comply with the ISM Code, each vessel must have a 
working  safety management system , which will typically consist of the following elements:  
 commitment from top management  
 a Top Tier Policy Manual  
 a Procedures Manual that documents what is done on board the ship, during norm al 
operations and in emergency situations  
 procedures for conducting both internal and external audits to ensure the crew are 
following procedures as laid out in the Procedures Manual  
 a Designated Person Ashore to serve as a direct link between the vessel's  crew  and senior 
management ashore, and to verify the safety management  system implementation  
 a system for identifying where actual practices do not meet those that are documented and 
for implementing associated corrective action  
 regular management reviews . 
4.5.5.  There are two aspects to the ISM Code system . The first is the safety management system 
from the perspective of the vessel manager (CIEL ) , which was subject to both external audits 
on behalf of the flag state Liberia and internal audits.  The second aspect was the safety 
management system  as applied  on board the Rena .  
4.5.6.  When safety issues were identified with the standard of voyage planning and navigation on 
board the Rena , the Commission examined those aspects of the Rena 's working safety 
management s ystem and CIEL's oversight of those aspects .  The Commission also considered 
the port state control records for the Rena  and other ships managed by the Rena 's owners.  
Port state control records provide one indicator as to how well a safety management system is 
functioning.  
Safe ship management system  on board the Rena  
Safety issue  - The CIEL oversight of the safety management system as applied on board the Rena  was 
not sufficient  to prevent a high number of port state control  deficiencies and violation s of some 
company procedures for voyage planning and navigation.  
4.5.7.  The design of the safety management system applied on  board the Rena  (what the company 
says the crew will do) went some way to meeting the intent of the ISM Code .  However, the 
documentation  that the crew were required to read in order to find out what was required of 
them was excessive.  For example , the system relied onl y on reference to nautical publications 
such as The Nautical Institute 's Bridge Team Management  - A Practical Guide  as the standard 
to be met.  While such publications are helpful and essential, the requirements would be 
better summarised and included in s imple templates, flow -diagrams, checklists and quick 
reference guides for the crew to use.  
4.5.8.  In its submission on the draft  final report CIEL  said that this suggestion was an "outdated 
approach" to ISM  Code  implementation because it was "overly prescriptive and discourages 
active analysis and application by the crew involved".  The Commission does not agree.  It is 
true that safety management systems should avoid being overly  prescriptive .  However, it is 
equally important that the system  does not place too much reliance  on crew having to extract 
key information from large documents that , realistically,  will rarely  be read .  Extracting the key 
points relevant to a particular shipboard operation is a useful method of highlighting important 
information to the crew.  CIEL has used this approach in summarising the key elements of 
other IMO documents.  
4.5.9.  The safety management system as applied on board was subject to external audits on behalf 
of the flag state Liberia, and internal audits.  The Co mmission obtained the internal audit 
reports conducted on the Rena  by CIEL .  Internal audits are a system for identifying where 
actual practices do not meet those that are documented and for implementing associated 
corrective actions referred to in the ISM Code.  They are an important process because if done 
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 35 >>
 properly they show a company commitment to ensuring that the documented system is 
implemented on the vessel and  is working.  
4.5.10.  The CIEL safety management system30 said that the objective s of internal audits were  to: 
 determine the implementation and effectiveness of the safety management system  
 determin e conformity or non -conformity of safety management system elements with 
specified contractual requirements  
 provide a basis for improvement of the safety management system  
 meet regulatory requirements.  
4.5.11.  A single audit cannot realistically cover every aspect of a ship's operation , but monitoring 
indicators of past and present performance is a good method for deciding on the  areas on 
which to focus.  
4.5.12.  In April 2011 the Rena 's Designated Person Ashore31 sailed on the vessel for four days, during 
which time h e conducted a  CIEL internal ISM Code audit  of the Rena 's safe ship management 
system .  The Designated Person Ashore was a qualified master -mariner and would therefore 
have been well qualified to detect any navigational deficiencies.  It is possible that the 
Designated Person Ashore's audit plan did not include assessment s of watchkeeping and 
navigation procedures, but a lot can be covered in four days and it would be surprising if the 
safety -critical function of bridge operations had not in some way been assessed.  
4.5.13.  The audit report did list several deficiencies associated with the bridge, including that the 
compass error was not being determined at least once every watch.  This finding show ed that 
bridge procedures were covered by the audit to some degree.  However, these observations 
need to be tempered by the knowledge that crew generally lift their performance immediately 
before and during a planned audit.  This makes it more difficult for t he auditor to identify any 
non-conformities or observations that would otherwise be raised.  Also,  an auditor would not 
necessarily focus in so much detail on one aspect of shipboard operations as an investigation 
does after an accident or incident has occ urred, unless that area of operation was of 
particular interest for some reason.  
4.5.14.  While he was on board , the crew were not complying with the safety management system with 
respect to passage planning/execution and position fixing.  Evidence of this was foun d in 
documents recovered from the Rena  and from the voyages reconstructed  after  the grounding .  
However, the Designated Person Ashore 's audit report did not note any other deficiencies 
regarding navigation or watchkeeping practices.    
 Port state control  
Safety issue  - The number of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena  and its 
detention in Fremantle for non -compliance with  statutory  requirements indicates  that the safety 
management system as applied on board the Rena  was not meeting the objectives of the ISM Code.  
Safety issue  - Eight of the 12 vessels managed by CIEL had higher rate s of deficiencies per inspection 
than the  average of all other  vessels subjected to port state control inspections in the Asia -Pacific 
region  in the same period .  The Rena 's deficiency rate was almost twice the average.  This indicated 
that the CIEL safety management system  for the vessels operating in the Asia -Pacific region, and for the 
Rena , was not functioning as it could have been according to the ISM Code . 
4.5.15.  The discussion above refers only to voyage planning and navigation standards.  A port state  
can inspect a vessel to ensure  that it is operating safely and in compliance with regulatory

ship and the highest level of management ashore.

 Final report 11 -204 requirements  while in its waters , which is also  a primary purpose  of a vessel 's safety 
management system.  Thus, the port state  control  inspection record can be used as an 
indicator of how effective ly a vessel 's safety management system is working .  
4.5.16.  To better co -ordinate the  port state  control  inspection of ships , IMO has encouraged the 
establishment of regional port state  control  organi sations  that operate to  agreements on port 
state  control  (memoranda of understanding ).  Such memoranda cover all of the world 's 
oceans.   The system was set up to avoid duplication of inspections on ships trading exclusively 
in one area, and to ensure that any deficiencies raised in one State are recorded, tracked and , 
when rectified, closed out  (possibly by another State ).   
4.5.17.  When an inspec tion is carried out the resultant report is submitted to the relevant co -
ordinating organisation .  New Zealand , for example , is a signatory to the Tokyo Memorandum 
of Understanding , which covers the Asia -Pacific region32.   
4.5.18.  Port state  control  inspections are usually conducted by the states ' maritime administration s 
and typically check ship and crew  certification as well as ships' safety equipment and 
maintenance.  For example , an inspection of the bridge may include checking that the charts 
for the voyage are valid and up  to date.  An obsolete  or out -of-date  chart would be identified as 
a deficiency in the port state  control  inspection report .   
4.5.19.  When a deficiency is identified and recorded , the crew must rectify that deficiency.  Each 
deficiency is recorded using one of six classification codes according to the nature and 
severity of the deficiency.  The classification then gives the timeframe to rectify the problem.  
The six cl assification codes are given in Table 5.  Two categories of particular interest are 
Code 17 and Code 30.  A classification of Code 17 means the vessel should not sail until the 
deficiency  is rectified.  A classification of Code 30 means the deficiency is s erious enough to 
detain the vessel until it has been rectified to the satisfaction of the port state control  officer.  
A Code 30 deficiency will also be reported to the flag state, which will usually trigger a flag 
state inspection of the vessel.  
4.5.20.  The Commission obtained the port state  control  records for the Rena , and also those records 
for other ships operated by CIEL and the other two management companies of Costamare Inc.  
Of 18 deficiencie s recorded against the Rena  in China , 12 were class ified as Code 17 
(required to  be rectified before departure) and  six were class ified as Code 16 ( required to be 
rectified within 14 days).  (See Appendix 3 for the full inspection report .) 
4.5.21.  About two weeks later the Rena  underwent another  "initial "33 port state  control inspection in 
Freemantle, Australia.  That inspection resulted in a further 17 new deficiencies, of which:  
 three  were classed as Code 30 (the ship was detained)  
 11 were classed as Code 17 (required to be rectified before the vessel sailed)  
 two were  classed as Code 16 (required to be rectified within 14 days)  
 one was classed as Code 18 (required to be rectified within three  months) . 
4.5.22.  The Code 18 deficiency was related to CIEL's safety management system  as applied on  board 
the Rena .  "The ISM has not ensured maintenance of the ship and equipment , as evidenced 
by 15 deficiencies [Code 16 and 17 deficiencies ]." (See Appendix 4 for  the full inspection 
report .) 
                                                        
32 The following states have accepted the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding: Australia, Marshall Islands, 
Canada, New Zealand, Chile, Papua New G uinea, China, Philippines, Fiji, Russian Federation, Hong Kong 
(China), Singapore, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, Japan, Thailand, Republic of Korea, Vanuatu, Malaysia  and 
Vietnam .  
33 An initial inspection is considered a new inspection because the vessel is considered by the port state to 
be due, usually judged on the time since the last inspection. An initial inspection may identify new 
deficiencies.  
  
Final report 11 -204

 4.5.23.  All but one of the port state  control  deficiencies newly identified in China and Australia had 
been closed out in follow -up34 inspections in Fremantle, Melbourne, Sydney , and Bluff .  The 
exception was the Code 18 deficiency relating t o the ISM Code , which had a timespan of three  
months to allow the ship and ship  management company to make the necessary adjustments 
to the  safety management system.

4.5.24.  The port state  control  inspection record  of the vessels owned by subsidiaries of Costamare 
Inc. were analysed  for the period from 1 June 2009 to 31 December 2011.   The source data 
for this analysis was taken from Maritime New Zealand , records seized from the Rena35, port 
state  control  memoranda of understanding databases, and information  provided by CIEL .  
4.5.25.  The vessels owned by subsidiaries of Costamare Inc. were managed by three vessel 
management companies  that were established to serve the Costamare fleet of container  
ships36. The three management companies were Costamare Shipping Company S.A., Shanghai 
Costamar e Shipmanagement Co. Ltd. and CIEL.  
4.5.26.  Costamare Inc . operated 76 vessels in three fleets. A  broad overview of the port state  control  
inspection record for th ose 76 identified vessels is given in  table 6 .  
4.5.27.  The fleet managed by C IEL had a higher rate of deficiencies per inspection than the other two 
fleets.  Even so, CIEL's rate of 2 .5 deficiencies per inspection was lower than the 
corresponding memoranda average  for all vessels , which was  3.0 deficiencies per inspection.   
This resul t suggests that overall the CIEL  safety management system  was operating 
effectively.     
 
  
                                                        
34 A follow -up inspection is diffe rent from an initial inspection.  A follow -up inspection  usually only looks at 
verifying and closing out previously identified deficiencies ; the purpose is not to identify new deficiencies . 
35 Not all vessels used in this analysis were owned and/or operated by a subsidiary of Costamare Inc . for the 
entire period.  A number of vessels were taken out of and/or brought into the fleets during this period.

4.5.28.  However, there are practical variations in the nature of port state  control inspections in the 
different memoranda regions. Because different fleets can operate exclusively in one or more 
of these regions, a better comparison of port state  control performa nce can be obtained by 
considering the data within each region.  That is, the vessels are inspected against the same 
criteria.  
4.5.29.  The CIEL fleet vessels had been inspected under at least six port state  control memoranda of 
understanding, and there were also s ome inspections carried out by the United States Coast 
Guard.  Not all memoranda statistics were available and so a comparison of the CIEL fleet 
against the corresponding memoranda was possible for only three of the memoranda of 
understanding (which accoun ts for 63% of all CIEL inspections).  Table 7 shows a comparison 
of CIEL against the corresponding memoranda of understanding.  
4.5.30.  The vessels managed by CIEL accrued a rate of deficiencies per inspection that was 
significantly lower than the average in at least two of the port state  control regions (24% of 
inspections). However , 39% of CIEL inspections were accrued under the Tokyo Mem orandum 
of Understanding  where the rate of deficiencies was slightly  higher than the  average.  The 
relevant data was not available to make a comparison for the remaining 37% of inspections 
(which covered the regions of another three memoranda of understandi ng and the United 
States Coast Guard).    
4.5.31.  CIEL had four detained vessels in 30 months within its fleet , of which two were under the 
Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding.

4.5.33.  In late 2010 the Rena  was purchased by a subsidiary of Costamare Inc. and brought into the 
fleet managed by CIEL.  The port state control  record for all inspections of the Rena  while 
under the management of CIEL  is given in Table 8.  With  a deficiency per inspection rate of 6.3  
(Figure 7), the Rena 's rate  was higher than the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding 's 
average  of 3.4 .  Nearly half of those deficiencies were classified as Code 17 and thus were 
required to  be rectified before the vessel sailed for the next port .  The three Code 30 
deficiencies , which resulted in the detention of the vessel  in Fremantle , triggered a Class 
survey the following day, which identified five of the port state control deficiencies as 
"statutory deficiencies "37.  The detention also triggered a Special Safety Inspection by the flag 
state Liberia in July 2011 , and also a Class survey in August 2011 .

 Final report 11 -204 4.5.34.  The reported deficiencies were an indication that the CIEL safety management system  was not 
ensuring  that the Rena  was maintained and operated in accordance with regulatory 
requirements , an observation supported by the 17 th deficiency raised in Fremantle - "ISM 
related deficiency/maintenance of the ship and equipment  - ISM has not ensured 
maintenance of ship and equipment as evidenced by deficiencies 1 -15".  
Summary of safety management systems  
4.5.35.  Port state control  inspections  are an indicator of the effectiveness of a vessel 's safety 
management system in achieving its purpose.  An effective  safety management system should 
ensure compliance with mandatory rules and regulations.   The port state control record for 
vessels managed  by CIEL  indicates  that the CIEL safety management system was operating 
relatively effectively in the regions  considered .    
4.5.36.  However, t he number of deficiencies identified against the Rena  and its detention in 
Fremantle for non -compliance with  statut ory requirements  indicate that the safety 
management s ystem as applied on board the Rena  was not meeting the objectives of the ISM 
Code.  Also, there  were clear indications that t he safety management system on board the  
Rena  was not functioning properly with respect to bridge and navigation procedures.  
4.5.37.  CIEL's safety management system was integral to the vessels it managed, including the Rena . 
Therefore if the Rena 's safety management system was  not meeting the objectives of the ISM 
Code , neither were some aspe cts of the CIEL safety management system.  
4.5.38.  When the Commission asked CIEL whether  any audits, reviews or safety actions had been 
under taken in response to the Rena  grounding , it responded , "Ciel's position is the same as 
has been established in the court process in New Zealand and as evidenced by the 
information provided.  The incident was caused by unfortunate human errors and the 
negligent discharge of duties by well qualified officers who had be en tested over time in their 
roles - not by any non -conformity with the system or deficiency in the system"38. 
4.5.39.  The Commission agrees that human error was one factor contributing to the grounding, but 
there were  several  other  contributing  factors that stemme d from safety  issues within broader  
systems.  There is some evidence that the CIEL safety management system , for its vessels  
trading in the Asia-Pacific region , was not adequate to ensure safe ship operation  and 
compliance with regulatory requir ements .  However, t he Commission did not conduct an 
investigation into CIEL's safety management system  for all its vessels, and CIEL did not 
provide the Commission with information relevant to the broader system when the 
Commission asked for it.  The Commission is accordingly unable to determine whether 
broader issues with  the CIEL safety management system  contributed to the accident.  
4.5.40.  With respect to port state control records, other vessels managed by CIEL also had higher 
rates of deficiencies than the average for the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding .  CIEL 
may wish to evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the 
issues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena  do not affect other vessels 
within its fleet.  
4.5.41.  CIEL's submission  about the qualifications and experience of the crew is discussed in the 
following section - International seafarer training and certification systems . 
 
                                                        
38 At the outset of the investigation CIEL invited the investigators to travel to Greece to see first hand its 
safety management system.  The investigators did not travel at that time because they were still in the early 
phase of the in vestigation.  Given CIEL's  response to these questions, the Commission decided the cost of 
travel to Greece would outweigh the benefits.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 41 >>
 Findings:  
13. The master and crew of the Rena  were not following navigation and 
watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the safety management 
system  on board the  Rena  for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the 
grounding .  The f ailure to follow the se standards set out in the Rena 's safety 
management system was a factor contrib uting to the grounding.  
14. There were clear indications that the safety management system on board the 
Rena  was not functioning properly with respect to bridge and navigation 
procedures.  
15. The number  of port state control deficiencies identified against the Rena  and its 
detention in Fremantle  for non-compliance with  statut ory requirements indicate  
that the safety management system as applied on board the Rena  was not 
meeting the objectives of the ISM Code.  
 
4.6. International seafarer t raining  and certification systems  
4.6.1.  The standard of watchkeeping on the bridge of the Rena  was not consistent with the 
requirements of the STCW Convention . Given the deficiencies identified with the performance 
of the master and crew of the Rena , the Commission considered their initial and ongoing 
training , and the broader system in which that training had taken  place.  The Commission 
further considered whether improvements could be made to the international seafarer training 
and certification sys tem that would assist in minimising the risk of future accidents and 
incidents similar to the Rena  grounding.   
Rena  bridge team training and development  
4.6.2.  Both the master and the second mate on board the Rena  when it grounded on Astrolabe Reef 
had received initial and ongoing training through the Philippine s' maritime education, training 
and certification system , between 1990 and 2007 for the master and 1995 and 2010 for the 
second mate.  
4.6.3.  The performance of a s eafarer is dependent not only on the standards set by their initial and 
ongoing training, but also on the performance standards and culture of the companies within 
which they have carried out their service.  
4.6.4.  The master had been employed by a number of diffe rent companies before, during and after 
completing his training for master qualification.  He had been employed by CIEL  since 2007, 
initially as first officer and then as captain.  
4.6.5.  The second officer had been employed by CIEL since 2003.  He had initially been employed as 
an able -bodied seaman and was then progressively promoted to junior officer, third officer and 
then to second officer on board the Rena , all under the master in command of the Rena  when 
it ran aground.  
4.6.6.  Both the master and the second mate ha d therefore been trained and had worked in the 
same systems for a number of years.  The Commission considered whether the training 
received by the crew might have played a part in their actions leading up to the grounding.   
4.6.7.  Independent audit s and inspections  of the Philippines ' training system were conducted by 
EMSA  in the period 2006 to the present .  They established that there were serious 
deficiencies with that system and its compliance with the standards required by the STCW 
Convention during t he period in which  the crew received training. The reports  raised the more 
general possibility that seafarers coming through the Philippines ' training system during this 
period could have received training  that did not meet the requisite standards .  

<< Page 42 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.6.8.  Whilst  the deficiencies in the Philippine s' training system coincide d with the period of ongoing 
training of the master and crew of the Rena , the Commission is unable to make any definitive 
findings that any issues with the ongoing training contributed to the ac cident , as it was not 
possible to undertake the broad review required to support such a finding. Nor did the 
Commission have specific information relating to the Rena  crew's individual training 
experiences in the Philippines to find that their training con tributed to the Rena 's grounding.  
4.6.9.  While not a factor specific to this accident, the Commission's enquiries nevertheless raised 
broader issues about the transparency of seafarer training standards under the STCW 
Convention, which may have broader safety implications for marine transport.  
Background  of the STCW Convention  
4.6.10.  An intended outcome of IMO was global uniformity of shipping standards , so that vessels 
trading internationally could do so as seamlessly as possible , and to the same standards.   The 
objective of the STCW Convention was to ensure that common minimum  standards applied to 
the crew  of those vessel s. The purpose of the STCW Convention was  to "promote safety of life 
and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment by establishing in common 
agreement international standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers".  
The STCW Convention  was amended  in 1991, 1 994, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2006, and most 
recently in 2010. A chronological history of the amendments and a summary of the changes 
made are included in Appendix 5. 
4.6.11.  By 200 2 there were 82 States that were signatories to the STCW Convention, including the 
Philippines.  The Philippines estimated that it had issued more than 300,000 seafarer 
certificates  of competenc e prior to 2002 . 
4.6.12.  The a chievement of c ommon standards of seafarer  training and certification  is important  as 
crew who have been trained in one State may go on to man vessels registered in other  States.  
The State in which a vessel is registered has some re sponsibility  for ensuring that the 
seafarers to whom it issues licences  of competence  have been trained to  the standards 
required by the  STCW Co nvention.    
4.6.13.  All State s in the maritime community also rely on the training and certification of seafarers 
provided  by other State s, as vessels with crew trained in other jurisdictions come into the 
territorial waters of other State s.  The international training and certification system is 
accordingly important to all State s, including New Zealand.  
4.6.14.  The Commission  accordingly considered whether the deficiencies identified by EMSA  in the 
audit process were appropriately addressed by the  broader training and certification system.  
Philippine s' seafarer training system  
Safety issue  - Independent audits had found that the Philippine  seafarer training system did not meet 
the standards specified by the STCW Convention  at both systemic and trai ning institute levels . 
4.6.15.  EMSA  conducted the audit  of, and follow -up reports on the Philippine s' seafarer training 
system.  It is one of the European Union's (EU's) decentralised agencies.  The agency provides 
technical assistance and support to the European Commission and member  states in the 
development and implementation of E U legislation on maritime safety, pollution by ships , and 
maritime security.  
4.6.16.  EMSA  began auditing  the Philippines ' maritime education, training and certification system  in 
2004 .  The initial audit was to review the suitability of the EU states to continu e to recognise 
certificates issued by the Philippines.  The timing of the EMSA  audit corresponded with the 
Philippines ' five-yearly audit required by the STCW  Convention  (as discussed in the next 
section , Implementing the STCW Convention ).  Consequently the EMSA  audit served both 
purposes . 
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 43 >>
 4.6.17.  EMSA  issued its first audit report in 2006 , which investigators from the  Commission were able 
to view , although a copy of it was not made available.  The Commission obtained copies of 
EMSA 's 2010 report of its follow -up inspection, and a draft of the 2012 report of its further 
follow -up inspection .  These reports found that at  a higher level there were deficiencies and 
"dysfunction" between the several agencies that had a role in administering the Philippine s' 
seafarer training system.  There w ere also deficiencies at the level of individual training 
institutes.  
4.6.18.  In 2011 the Phi lippines had submitted a response report to EMSA  detailing corrective 
measures taken  following the 2010 follow -up inspection and report.  The 2012 draft report of 
the further follow -up inspection continued to record significant deficiencies, however . 
4.6.19.  Although the 2012 EMSA  draft report  acknowledged progress, it still found serious issues with 
the maritime education, training and certification system.  In November 2012 the European 
Commission issued "Information"39 to EU member States "about shortcomings  in compliance 
by the Philippines' training system and certification of seafarers with the requirements of the 
STCW Convention".  The Information said that:  
recent actions undertaken by the Philippines' government have brought the 
country 's regulatory fram ework in line with the requirements of the STCW 
Convention on the certification of seafarers and the quality standard system to 
be implemented by the administration. However, it also appears that 
administrative practices are still not in line with this new  regulatory framework.  
As a result, there are still deficiencies at the level of the administration40. 
4.6.20.  The Information  went on to say that the deficiencies were "mirrored in the shortcomings 
detected at the schools' level, relating to programmes, methods, use of equipment and the 
absence of equipment itself "41. 
4.6.21.  The Information  concluded as follows:  
In conclusion, there is a clear constant trend in the Philippines as regards 
ensuring the full compliance with the requirements of the STCW Convention. 
However, t his degree of compliance has not been achieved yet.  Should this trend 
slow down and should full compliance with the requirements of the STCW 
Convention not be achieved in a reasonable time -span - also considering the 
time that has already elapsed since the  first inspection - then, the withdrawal of 
EU recognition of the Philippines in relation to its training and certification 
system of seafarers should be fully taken into consideration . 
4.6.22.  When the Commission's investigators visited Manila in October 2012, a major restructure of 
the Philippine s' maritime education, training and certification system had begun in response 
to the 2012 EMSA  report.  Details of the corrective actions are shown in the Safety actions 
section (section 6) of this report.  
4.6.23.  Given the deficiencies that EMSA  identified with the Philippine s' maritime education, training 
and certification system  over a period of time  the Commission considered the IMO system for 
implementing the STCW Convention  in order to identify whether improve ments to that system 
might assist in reducing the risk of future accidents and incidents to which deficiencies in the 
training of crew may have contributed . 
Implementing the STCW Convention   
4.6.24.  The STCW [ 1995] Convention  required member States to submit to  IMO, by August 1998, 
information on the steps taken by the State s to "give the STCW [95] Convention full and 
complete effect"42.  The intention was that IMO publish a list of States whose seafarer training 
                                                        
39 2012/C 367/01 . 
40 Paragraph 11 (2012/C 367/01) . 
41 Paragraph 12 ( 2012/ 21012 /C 367/01 ). 
42 STCW [1995] Convention Section A1/7.  

<< Page 44 >>
 Final report 11 -204 systems could give full and complete effect to the ST CW [ 1995] Convention.  This list became 
known as the "White List".  
4.6.25.  The White List  was published  in December 2000.  A statement released by IMO (see Appendix 
6. said that "A position [of a State] on the White List entitles other [States] to accept, in 
principle , that certificates issued by or on behalf of [States] on the White List are in 
compliance with the Convention".  
4.6.26.  The acceptance of a State on the White List did not, however, involve any assessment on 
whether its seafarer training system did in fa ct meet those standards.  It merely indicated that 
it "could" do so.  Regulation I/10 of the STCW [ 1995] Convention continued to place the 
responsibility on the member States to satisfy themselves that other States' systems were 
compliant before recognisin g certificates issued by them.  
4.6.27.  It became apparent that there was uncertainty over the significance of the inclusion of a State 
on the White List, however.  As a result of an STCW [2010] Convention meeting , IMO 
published (in June 2013) a circular43 that contained the following to remind  parties  of their 
obligations under Regulation I/10  regardless of the White List : 
The Committee draws the attention of maritime administrations, ship owners , 
ship operators and managers, ship masters and other parties concerned to 
the following:  
.2 the fact that a Party is listed in the annex  [the White List]  does 
not relieve those concerned of their obligations under the 
STCW Convention . 
4.6.28.  Regulation I/10 (as applied at the time of the Rena  grounding) read:  
"Regulation I/10 
Recognition of certificates  
1 Each Administration shall ensure that the provisions of this regulation are complied with, in order to 
recognize, by endorsement in accordance with regulation I/2, paragraph 544, a certificate issued by or 
under the author ity of another Party to a master, officer or radio operator and that:  
 .1 the Administration has confirmed, through all necessary measures, which may include 
inspection of facilities and procedures, that the requirements concerning standards of 
competence , the issue and endorsement of certificates and record keeping are fully complied 
with; and  
.2 an undertaking is agreed with the Party concerned that prompt notification will be given of any 
significant change in the arrangements for training and certification provided in compliance with 
the Convention."  
 
4.6.29.  Because the Rena  was registered in Liberia , the Commission considered the process  that 
Liberia  had followed in meeting its obligations under Regulation I/10 when it recognised the 
Philippine certificates of competency . 
  
                                                        
43 MSC 1/circ.1164 Rev 11 of 7 January 2013 . 
44 Regulation I/2[5] An Administration which recognises a certificate under Regulation I/10 shall endorse 
such certificate to attest its recognition.  The endorsement shall on ly be issued if all requirements of the 
Convention have been complied with.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 45 >>
 Liberian Registry  
Safety issue  - The Liberia n Registry recognised by endorsement certificates issued by the Philippines in 
accordance with STCW Convention Regulation I/10 , when independent audits found that the 
Philippine s' maritime education, training and certification system did not meet the standards specified 
in the STCW [95] Convention . 
4.6.30.  The Liberian Registry is administered by the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry.  
Liberia is also included on the White L ist, not as a provider of trained seafarers but as a State 
that relies on the recognition of certificates issued to seafarers by other States.  The STCW 
Convention Regulation I/10 is therefore of particular relevance to the Liberian Registry.   
4.6.31.  The Liberia n Registry entered a memorandum of understanding with the Philippines in 2002.  
The memorandum covered the following points:  
 identification of the parties as competent authorities  
 the right to visitation/inspection/audit of the facilities of the Certificat e Issuing Party  
 scope of such visits  
 [points of contact] for the parties  
 notification of significant changes for training and certification provided in compliance 
with the Convention  
 citing examples of such changes that should trigger notification  
 process of termination of the [memorandum] by either Party . 
4.6.32.  The memorandum of understanding agreed that the Philippines "shall make available to 
[Liberia] the results of the external audit reports on the quality standards evaluations 
conducted in accordance  with paragraph 3, Section A -1/8 of the STCW Code" (the five-year 
evaluations).  
4.6.33.  The Philippines did not offer , nor did Liberia ask for , copies of the EMSA audit and follow -up 
reports produced  between 2006 and 2012.  Neither did the Philippines notify Liber ia that it 
was making major changes to the administration of its maritime education, training and 
certification system during 2012, which was a requirement under the memorandum of 
understanding.  
4.6.34.  The Liberia n Registry  submitted  that Liberia, in accordance w ith the STCW Convention and 
pursuant to Regulation I/10, recognised the Philippines ' certificates issued to the Philippine 
seafarers serving on board the Rena .  It said that the inclusion of the Philippines on the White 
List meant that it was "deemed to have given full and complete effect to the standards of the 
STCW [1995] Convention". As indicated above, however, the inclusion of a State on the White 
List did not mean that the State had met all its obligations.  Between 2000 (when the Whi te 
List was published) and 2009 , the Liberian Registry did not visit or approve any training 
institutes.  The Liberian Registry visited and "approved" 15 different training institutes in the 
Philippines between June 2009 and April 2013.   
4.6.35.  The Liberian situ ation may not be unique.  It is a good example of how transparency in the 
audit results could assist it and other member States in ensuring that the basis for recognising 
seafarer certificates issued by other States is robust, without having to repeat the full audit 
process themselves and risk overburdening the entire global training system.  
4.6.36.  If the terms agreed in the memorandum of understanding between the Philippines and Liberia 
had been followed, Liberia could have been alerted as early as 2006 to proble ms the 
Philippine s' maritime education, training and certification system was having in ensuring  that 
the standards specified in the STCW Convention were met, and then taken whatever action 
was needed to satisfy its obligations under STCW Convention Regula tion I/10.  

<< Page 46 >>
 Final report 11 -204 The practicality of verifying other States' seafarer training systems  
Safety issue  - The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries ' maritime education, training and 
certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess  easily  whether 
to recognise the qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant with STCW standards . 
4.6.37.  States are required by the STCW Convention to have independent evaluation s made of their 
seafarer training system s at intervals not exceeding five years45.  The auditors raise any 
deficiencies or non -compliances with the State s concerned, together with the corrective 
action s required to close them out.  The Philippines said  that the evaluations carried out by 
EMSA had  served the purpose of the five-yearly audit .  This process has been described in 
more detail  above . 
4.6.38.  Consolidated audit reports from the five-yearly evaluations must be submitted to IMO.  IMO 
evaluate s the content and publish es a list of member State s that have demonstrated "that 
they were giving full and complete effect to the relevant provisions of the STCW Convention "46. 
However , the audit reports are not disclosed to other member State s. Thus other states are 
theoretically required to undertake their own enquiries or audits to satisfy the requir ements of 
STCW Convention Regulation I/10 (to ensure  that their training and certification system s meet 
STCW Convention standards ). 
4.6.39.  If this were  to occur, it could lead to maritime administration s being overwhelmed by auditors, 
arguably to the detriment of administering their own training and certification systems.  This 
requirement seems  to contemplate  an unnec essary  duplication of resources that could be 
avoided if the system were  more transparent.   Until transparency can be achieved , it will be 
difficult to achieve uniformity of standards among the global training s ystems, which was the 
purpose of introducing the STCW Convention.   For example, the consolidated reports 
submitted to IMO could be made available to other member State s.  The Commission 
acknowledges  that there may be counterv ailing interests to consider around maintaining the 
confidentiality of audits , but these are likely to be outweighed by the  benefits of achieving 
greater transparency and reducing duplication of effort in achieving consistently high 
standards of seafarer trainin g globally . 
Future status of the IMO White List  
4.6.40.  The publication of the White List  was the first time  that IMO had been given a direct role in the 
implementation of one of its instruments.  The intention behind creating the White List  was to 
lift the global standard of seafarer training.  However, there was ambiguity created by IMO 
publishing the White List and there is now a question about  the status  that the White List  
should be given and what a State's inclusion on it actually signif ies. 
4.6.41.  Further, th ere is no agreed mechanism for States to be removed from the White List  should 
their systems subsequently be found to not meet the standards of the STCW Convention.  The 
majority of IMO's member States do not have  access to information that could or should  be 
used to determine whether a State should remain on it - important information that member 
States should have to assist them to confirm "through all necessary measures" whether the 
system in question complies with the STCW Convention.

Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 47 >>
 Finding:  
16. The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries ' maritime education, 
training and certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist 
other countries to assess easily whether to recognise the qualification 
certificates issued by those countrie s as compliant with the STCW  Convention  
standards.  Better transparency of this process could avoid unnecessary 
duplication and exp edite the harmonisation of global seafarer training and 
certification systems.  
4.7. Summary of issues affecting standards of navi gation  
4.7.1.  The passage planning and navigation during the Rena 's final voyage was substandard and 
contributed to the grounding .  The sections above highlight safety issues with the Rena 's 
safety management system and with the Philippine s' and global  seafarer training and 
certification system s.  These factors have their origins in the wider system s in which many 
other ships worldwide  are operating.  
4.7.2.  The description of the global seafarer training system given in this report , and how that could 
affect the standar ds of navigation on board ships worldwide , is a salient reminder that ship 
owners and operators cannot afford to be complacent about relying on the qualifications and 
experience of the crews they employ.  
4.7.3.  The issue involving  the implementation of the Philip pines' maritime education, training and 
certification system may not be unique.  Other training administrations could have similar 
issues .  It may therefore be some considerable time before true harmonisation of  the STCW  
Convention  standards can be achieved globally.  
4.7.4.  Safety management systems are intended to ensure that industry best practice and 
mandatory regulatory requirements are met, as a minimum.  It is therefore incumbent on ship 
owners, operators and man agers to ensure that their safety management systems achieve 
that on board their ships.  A good safety management system should manage the risk that 
some crews are poorly trained in spite of their holding recognised maritime qualification s.  
Requiring and enforcing high standa rds on board their ships will help to manage that risk.  
4.8. Coastal ship routing  
4.8.1.  During the inquiry it was put to the Commission that the introduction of mandatory ship 
routing around the New Zealand coast, and in particular around the approaches to the port of 
Tauranga , was necessary to prevent similar accidents to the Rena  grounding occurring again.  
The topic has  also been debated in the media.  
4.8.2.  The Commission considered this issue and concluded that the introduction of ship routing for 
all coastal New Zealand is not justified at this time.  There may , however , be a justification for 
adopting some form of ship routing on a localised scale where a risk assessment based on 
real data on shipping movements reveals the need for such a system .  The Commission has 
made a broad search for data on shipping movements around New Zealand and has 
concluded  that the data currently available is not sufficient to say one way or another whether 
the introduction of ship routing would be justified for any local coastal area .  If ship routing in 
any form were to be introduced, either Maritime  New Zealand or local government would need 
to collect sufficient data to support a proper risk assessment.  A credible risk assessment 
should give a credible answer as to whether ship routing is justified in a given location.  
4.8.3.  IMO is recognised as the only international body for developing guidelines, criteria and 
regulations on an international level for ships ' routing systems.  To understand the concept of 

<< Page 48 >>
 Final report 11 -204 ship routing, it is necessary to refer to the SOLAS Convention Regulation 5 and IMO General 
Provisions on Ships ' Routing 47.   
4.8.4.  The SOLAS Convention says that "ship routing systems should be submitted to IMO for 
adoption, but if a Government decides not to d o so then they are encouraged to take into 
account the guidelines and criteria developed by  IMO" .  There is a safety benefit if ships 
navigating internationally can do so using ship routing systems designed to the same criteria.  
This is consistent with the purpose of IMO - harmonisation of standards across the globe.  
4.8.5.  IMO's General Provisions on Ships ' Routeing state s that the objective for ship routing is to:  
"improve the safety of navigation in converging areas and in areas where the density of traffic 
is great or where freedom of movement of shipping is inhibited by restricted sea -room, the 
existence of obstructions to navigation, limited depths or unfavourable meteorological 
conditions" . 
4.8.6.  The precise objective of any IMO routing system is described as " including some or all of the 
following:  
 The separation of opposing streams of traffic so as to reduce the incidence of head -on 
collisions;  
 The reduction of dangers of collision between crossing traffic and shipping in established 
traffic lanes;  
 The simplif ication of the patterns of traffic flow in converging areas;  
 The organization of safe traffic flow in areas of concentrated offshore exploration or 
exploitation  
 The organisation of traffic flow in or around areas where navigation by all ships or by 
certain  classes of ships is dangerous or undesirable;  
 The reduction of risk of grounding by providing special guidance to vessels in areas where 
water depths are uncertain or critical;  
 The guidance of traffic clear of fishing grounds or the organisation of traffi c through the 
fishing grounds ". 
4.8.7.  The shipping traffic around the New Zealand coast cannot be described as dense in 
comparison with other area s around the world such as Europe and Asia , where IMO -approved 
ship routing systems are prevalent.  A sample review of recorded automatic identification 
system data for the coastal area between East Cape and Auckland showed that typically there 
were only about 15 ships48 in the area at any one time.  By comparison, in the afore -
mentioned regions the number of ships in such an area would be counted in thousands.  
4.8.8.  When the Rena  was making its approach to the port of Tauranga, traffic density was not a 
safety issue.  There were as few as three  other vessels in the immediate area and  none was 
so close to the Rena  that it would be considered a factor in the grounding.  Astrolabe Reef was 
an obvious navigational hazard to avoid, but it was well charted and the Rena  crew had 
planned to avoid it by two nautical miles in their initial passage plan.  There are literally 
thousands of other such navigational hazards for ships to avoid as they navigate the New 
Zealand coast49. 
4.8.9.  A safety issue in this case was poor navigational practices rather than the crew being 
overwhelmed by traffic density or hampered by difficult navigational conditions.  Automatic 
identification system  data showed other prior  incidences  of large ships passi ng close to, and 
                                                        
47 IMO Resolution A.572(14) and SOLAS Safety of Navigation/Chapte r V/Regulation 10.  
48 Larger vessels that are required to have automatic  identification system s fitted, which would exclude 
fishing and private vessels and smaller commercial vessels.  
49 What constitutes a hazard will depend on several factors, such as the s ize of the ship, its manoeuvrability 
and the depth it draws.  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 49 >>
 even inside , Astrolabe Reef.  Tauranga is one of New Zealand's busiest ports, and shipping 
does converge near its entrance at designated times governed by the state of the tide50.  If 
there had been some form of mandatory ship routing that required ships to stay a safe 
distance off Astrolabe Reef , the Rena 's crew would more than likely have heed ed those 
mandatory directions and the grounding would likely have been avoided . 
4.8.10.  Tauranga is one example where local government could conduct a risk assessment to 
determine whether implementing a ship routing system off the port is justifiable.  
4.9. Aids to navigation  
4.9.1.  During the inquiry it was put to the Commission that Astrolabe Reef should have been marked 
with a light beacon or some other aid to navigation, and that if it had been the grounding 
would have been prevented.  To put this argument in context, there are many other safety 
issues identified in this report that , had they never arisen, the grounding probably would not 
have happ ened.  Nevertheless the Commission considered this issue.  
4.9.2.  The Commission agrees that had there been a light beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef it is 
highly likely that the grounding would have been prevented.  The presence of a flashing light 
would have been a stark indicator to the bridge crew that their ship was heading directly for 
Astrolabe Reef, particularly when the master noticed the echo of the reef on his radar and 
began looking for what was causing it.  
4.9.3.  However, t here are many rocks, reefs and other n avigational hazards around the New Zealand 
coast.  Installing and maintaining navigation aids on remote hazards is costly.  Some years ago 
Maritime  New Zealand consulted the industry on the need to maintain lighthouses and light 
beacons around the New Zeal and coast.  After that it relocated and automated the main lights 
to both reduce cost and improve their reliability.  
4.9.4.  Historically coastal lights were installed as visual aids to navigation in an era when electronic 
aids to navigation were few and less advanced than the modern GPS and other electronic 
systems that are available today at minimal cost.  
4.9.5.  Cultural and environmental factors related to installing and maintaining aids to navigation 
must also be considered with respect to the Resou rce Mana gement Act 1991.  
4.9.6.  The Rena  bridge was not fitted with a n electronic  chart plotter with a GPS feed.  Such 
equipment is inexpensive to install and most large ships are fitted with it.  An electronic chart 
plotter would have shown at a glance the Rena 's position in relation to Astrolabe Reef.  
4.9.7.  Astrolabe Reef was well  displayed as a danger to surface navigation on the chart being used 
by the Rena  bridge team.  There was sufficient surrounding topography in the vicinity and the 
Rena  had sufficient bridge navigational eq uipment, even without a chart plotter , to avoid 
colliding with the reef without needing the aid of a light beacon on the reef.  
4.9.8.  A more cost -effective option is being trialled by the International Association of Marine Aids to 
Navigation and Lighthouse Autho rities  - that is , "virtual aids to navigation ".  In its draft 
guidelines on virtual aids to navigation , the International Association of Marine Aids to 
Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities  describe s them as " a virtual aid to navigation [that] 
does not physically exist but is a digital information object promulgated by an authorized 
service provider that can be presented on navigational systems" .  
4.9.9.  Simply put , a virtual aid to navigation  is a navigational aid  that is normally communicated by 
VHF radio sig nal in an automatic identification system  message.  A virtual aid to navigation  
could be projected on to Astrolabe Reef and this would show up as a symbol on a ship's radar 
and other electronic navigation equipment set up to receive the signal.  
                                                        
50 Strong tidal streams in the entrance channel restrict the times that ships can transit the channel inbound 
and outbound depending on ship size and draft.  

<< Page 50 >>
 Final report 11 -204 4.9.10.  This technology will likely in future provide a recognised alternative to physically placing lights 
and beacons on navigational hazards.  
4.9.11.  When researching this matter the Commission noted that the re were several examples of 
virtual a ids to navigation  already bei ng used by port companies and regional councils  near 
port approaches .  Some caution needs to be exercised when using a new type of navigation 
aid before proper research has been conducted and performance standards developed for its 
use. 
4.9.12.  There is also the m atter of educating mariners in the concept of virtual a ids to navigation , and 
the reliance that can be placed on them to navigate ships.  An over-reliance on the accuracy of 
electronic aids to navigation has been causal in many ship groundings over the yea rs. 
4.9.13.  The Commission has raised this safety issue with the Director of Maritime  New Zealand  in its 
recommendations.  
Findings:  
17. A light beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef is another measure that probably would 
have alerted or reminded the bridge team to the presence of Astrolabe Reef, and 
would likely have prevented the Rena  grounding . However, this needs to be seen 
in the context of: 
 the number of other dangerous rocks and reefs around the New Zealand 
coastline  
 the cost versus the benefit s of fitting and maintaining light beacons on all such 
rocks and reefs  
 the availability and prevalent use of more modern and accurate navigation 
systems for avoiding such navigational dangers  
 further advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation that 
are likely to replace physical light beacons in future  
 relevant Resource Management Act considerations . 
18. A simple stand -alone chart  plotter or a chart plotter integrated with the radar was 
a low -cost and effective aid to navigation that would have visually alerted the 
Rena 's bridge team that the Rena  was tracking directly towards Astrolabe Reef . 
19. The use of virtual aids to navigation c ould be one alternative method for 
highlighting dangers to navigation.  However, they should not be introduced 
before proper research into, and the development of performance standards for 
them have been completed.

 5. Findings  
5.1 The Rena  grounding was not in any way attributable to the malfunction of any on -board 
machinery or equipment, including on -board navigational equipment.  
5.2 The Rena 's passage plan from Napier to Tauranga on the accident voyage did not meet the 
standar ds documented in the CIEL safety management system  or the International Maritime 
Organization  Voyage Planning Guidelines.  Nor did it meet best industry practice as 
documented in The Nautical Institute  Bridge Team Management - A Practical Guide .   
5.3 The second mate deviated from the passage plan to take the Rena  closer to Astrolabe Reef to 
save time.  The deviation unnecessarily increased the risk of the ship running aground and 
contributed directly to the grounding.  
5.4 The Rena  grounded on Astrolabe Reef because the bridge crew progressively adjusted the 
automatic pilot to an incorrect heading  and without making allowance for any leeway, set or 
gyrocompass error.  The resultant ground track took the ship directly over the reef.  Not 
monitoring the progress of the ship against the deviation directly  contributed  to the grounding.  
5.5 The failure of the crew to follow industry best practice guidelines for making and executing the 
passage plan on the accident voyage  was not an isolat ed case.  A review of previous voyage 
plans revealed a number of acts and omissions similar to those made on the accident voyage.  
5.6 The standard of watchkeeping on board the Rena  for the accident voyage, and particularly for 
the watch period during which the grounding  occur red, in almost all respects did not comply 
with the requirements of the International Convention on Standards of training , Certification , 
and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978  (STCW Convention) , the IMO Voyage Planning 
Guidelines, the CIEL safety management system  or industry best practice described in The 
Nautical Institute's Bridge Team Management - a Practical Guide.  
5.7 The Rena 's crew were not following company procedures with respect to  monitoring the 
progress of the ship in relation to known dangers to navigation for the entire voyage  from 
Napier to the time of the grounding.  A failure to monitor adequately the progress of the Rena  
contributed directly to the grounding.  
5.8 The second m ate was not making the most effective use of the bridge navigation equipment 
on board the Rena  before the grounding - had he done so either he or the master would have 
been alerted to the presence of Astrolabe Reef in time to avert the grounding.  
5.9 The m aster assumed control of the Rena  when the ship was tracking directly for Astrolabe 
Reef.  There was no clear delineation  of who had control of the Rena  at the time of the 
grounding, and the master, having assumed that he had taken control, had received vi rtually 
no information on where the ship was , where it was heading , and what immediate dangers to 
navigation he needed to consider.  
5.10  The master's work and sleep schedule in the three days preceding the accident placed him at 
risk of his cognitive perfo rmance being impaired  by fatigue.  The combination of the effects of 
time of day for sleep and work, sleep duration and sleep fragmentation acted to create 
significant sleep debt.  
5.11  The second mate's work and sleep schedule in the three days before the accident meant that 
there was, at least, a mild to moderate  risk of his cognitive performance being impaired by 
fatigue.  
5.12  The performance of both the master and the second mate was likely to have been at least 
mildly affected by fatigue during the work  period midnight  to 0215, the period leading up to 
the grounding , but  there  was insufficient evidence  to determine whether  their actions leading 
up to the grounding were attributable to fatigue . 
 

<< Page 52 >>
 Final report 11 -204 5.13  The master and crew of the Rena  were not following navigation and watchkeeping standards 
and procedures set down in the safety management system  on board the  Rena  for at least the 
six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding .  The f ailure to follow the se standards set out 
in the Rena 's safety management system was a factor contributing to the grounding.  
5.14  There were clear indications that the safety management system on board the Rena  was not 
functioning properly with respect to bridge and navigation  procedures.   
5.15  The number of port state control deficiencies identified  against the Rena  and its detention in 
Fremantle for non -compliance with  statut ory requirements indicate that the safety 
management s ystem as applied on board the Rena  was not meeting the objectives of th e ISM 
Code.  
5.16  The STCW Convention protocols for auditing countries ' maritime education, training and 
certification systems lacked the transparency that would assist other countries to assess 
easily whether to recognise qualification certificates issued by those countries as compliant 
with the STCW  Convention  standards.  Better transparency  of this process could avoid 
unnecessary duplication and exp edite the harmonisation of global seafarer training and 
certification systems.  
5.17  A light beacon placed on Astrolabe Reef is another measure that probably would have alerted 
or reminded the bridge team to the presence of Astrolabe Reef, and would likely have 
prevented the Rena  grounding . However, this needs to be seen in the context of:  
 the number of other dangerous rocks and reefs around the New Zealand coastline  
 the cost versus the benefit s of fitting and maintaining light beacons on all such rocks and 
reefs  
 the availability and prevalent use of more modern and accurate navigation syst ems for 
avoiding such navigational dangers  
 further advanced systems such as virtual and synthetic aids to navigation that are likely to 
replace physical light beacons in future  
 relevant Resource Management Act considerations.  
5.18  A simple stand -alone char t plotter or a chart plotter integrated with the radar was a low -cost 
and effective aid to navigation that would have visually alerted the Rena 's bridge team that 
the Rena  was tracking directly towards Astrolabe  Reef.  
5.19  The use of virtual aids to naviga tion could be one alternative method for highlighting dangers 
to navigation.  However, they should not be introduced  before proper research into, and the 
development of performance standards for , them have been completed.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
[None identified]  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2.  Philippine s' maritime training and certification system  
In 2006 w hen EMSA concluded its initial  evaluation of the Philippines ' seafarer training 
system it found the system did not meet the standards specified in  the STCW Convention.  
Recent actions undertaken by the Philippines government have brought the country's  
regulatory framework in line with the requirements of the STCW Convention on the 
certification of seafarers and the quality standard system to be implement ed by the 
administration.  
The Philippine s' seafarer training system is still under review by the European Commission to 
ensure that the Philippines continue s to work towards giving full and complete effect to the 
STCW Convention.  Consequently there is no  need for the Commission to make 
recommendations to address the safety issues already identified by the European 
Commission.  
6.3. In a report forwarded to the Commission by the Philippines it has summarised its corrective 
actions, as of July 2013, in response t o EMSA  as follows (inter alia):  
Please be assured that the Philippine Government takes seriously the EMSA 
[European Maritime Safety Agency] findings  and that it is committed not only to 
passing the last and final audit scheduled in October but also to ensu ring full 
compliance with STCW [Convention] standards. As such, we would like to provide 
you with the following updates on actions being taken by MARINA with regard to 
its most important function of oversight of the concerned agencies in the 
Philippines to  ensure compliance with our country's obligations under the STCW 
[Convention].  
 On the National Quality Standards System (NQSS), MARINA is closely 
coordinating with the concerned members  agencies to fast track the 
alignment of their respective QSS to the NQ SS. After directing all 
member agencies to finish their self -assessment audits by June, 
MARINA has now commenced its audit of the member agencies.  
 On the conflict of interest of assessors/evaluators, MARINA is ensuring 
that its criteria for selecting Techn ical Evaluators shall be adopted by 
the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) and that appropriate 
revisions to the forms being used in examination and certification will 
be made. Likewise, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has 
already reconstit uted its Technical Panel for Maritime Education (TPME) 
to avoid conflict of interest.  
 On the monitoring of maritime schools, CHED issued Special Order No. 
24 deputizing the monitoring of maritime schools to MARINA. President 
Benigno S. Aquino III has approved the release of additional budget in 

<< Page 54 >>
 Final report 11 -204 order to reinforce MARINA's capacity to monito r the maritime education  
and training system nationwide.  
MARINA , together with its sister agencies involved in ensuring compliance with 
our obligations under the STCW Convention, are working continuously to put in 
place a monitoring framework that will per manently address the systemic 
deficiencies that have led to the less than favourable outcome of last April's 
audit. We shall keep you informed from time to time of further actions taken in 
this regard.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to CIEL and Maritime New Zealand . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents  or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations to CIEL  
7.3. On board the Rena , the master and crew were not following the navigation and watchkeeping 
standards and procedures set down in the Rena' s safety management system for at least the 
six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding . 
With respect to port state control records, other vessels managed by CIEL also had a higher 
than average rate of deficiencies than the average for the Asia -Pacific region.  
The Commission recommends  that CIEL evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management 
system to  ensure  that the issues identified with that  system as applied  on board the Rena  do 
not affect other vessels within  its fleet . (010/14)  
7.3.1.  On 11th December 2014, CIEL Shipmanagement replied, in part:  
1. We understand the first two paragraphs of recommendation 010/14 are 
given by way of introduction or summary of the conclusions in the report.  
However, you will also appreciate from our previous submissions, we do not 
agree with these two paragraphs.  
2. The first two paragraphs are statements of facts and opinions and are not 
recom mendations.  It is not possible to implement anything asserted in the 
first two paragraphs as has been suggested.  
3. CIEL strongly objects to the content and utility of these two paragraphs in the 
recommendation for the reasons [given].   
. . . 
 
11. With regard t o the actual recommendation in the third paragraph CIEL had 
implemented such a review.  This included an internal review of the safety 
management system and the performance of vessel audits, including 
navigational audits.  
Recommendations to Maritime New Zealand  
7.4. Member States are required to undergo five-yearly independent evaluation s of their seafarer 
training system s.  However, those  evaluation s remain confidential between the IMO, the 
auditing State s and the State s being assessed.  Accor ding to Regulation I/10, member States 
are required to verify for themselves the effectiveness of other States ' maritime education, 
training and certification system s before recognising certificates issued by those  State s.  
However , this can only be realis tically achieved through a full systemic audit of the seafarer 
training system.  If this were  to happen it is likely that the global training system would be 
unnecessarily overburdened.  This safety issue could be resolved if reports made after the 
five-yearly independent evaluations were required  to be  made available to other member 
states.  
The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime  New Zealand  promote , through 
the appropriate IMO forum, the importance  of sharing amongst member states information 
regarding the quality of member states'  maritime education, training and certification systems , 

<< Page 56 >>
 Final report 11 -204 including a consideration of making the five -yearly evaluation s of member states'  available to 
other member states . (012/14)  
7.4.1.  On 28 November  2014, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
The Director of Maritime New Zealand understands this recommendation to be 
aimed at improving transparency under the existing STCW Convention regime as 
opposed to revisiting the underpinning principles of that regime.  To that end the 
Director accepts the recommendation and will include it in the work programme 
(Goal 1) underpinning the Strategy for New Zealand's Engagement in the IMO.  
7.5. It is probable that if an aid to navigation of some type had been installed on Astrolabe Reef, 
the Rena  grounding would  have been prevented.  However, there are many such isolated 
dangers to navigation around the coast of New Zealand.  Installing and maintaining physical 
navigational aids on remote hazards is costly.  Virtual aids to navigatio n are potentially a cost -
effective means of marking such isolated dangers.  However, these are still being trialled by 
the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities and no 
performance criteria have yet been set regar ding their accuracy and intended use.  The 
Commission noted during its inquiry that although the technology is relatively new and there is 
no regulatory framework in place, some port authorities are already beginning to use virtual 
aids to navigation.  The re is a potential safety issue around the use of aids to navigation that 
have not been fully tested.  
The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime  New Zealand  consider the use of 
virtual aids to navigation and monitor progress through the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA)  of the development of performance criteria for them, but meanwhile work 
with regional councils and port companies to control the use of virtual aids to navigation until 
they have been fully assessed and approp riate performance criteria set by IATA and Maritime  
New Zealand . (013/14)  
7.5.1.  On 13 October 2014, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
The Director of Maritime New Zealand accepts this recommendation (noting that 
the references to IATA are erroneous and should be a r eference to IALA) and 
notes that in its Statement of Intent 2014 -2020 Maritime New Zealand has 
included a Review of Costal Navigation Safety as a key strategic review of the 
safety regulatory system.  The Director of Maritime New Zealand initiated this 
review in August 2014 and the review will consider the use of navigation aids 
(including virtual aids) as part of its inquiry.  The Terms of Reference for the 
review are attached and include timelines for key deliverables.  
In addition The Director of Maritime  New Zealand established (in 2012) a joint 
MNZ/Regional Council CE s' group to facilitate cross agency engagement and 
promotion of navigation safety matters.  A significant initiative , led b y Maritime 
New Zealand, in the first year of the establishment of t he group has been the 
conduct of an environmental scan of the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine 
Safety Code.  The findings of that scan will inform the Coastal Navigation Safety 
Review and the cross -agency co -ordinated responses to the findings are 
expec ted to address the recommendations of the Commission.  
7.6. There is insufficient data available on the New Zealand coast to make any meaningful analysis 
of shipping routes, density of ship traffic or potential areas of shipping convergence that might 
warrant th e introduction of local ship routing systems.  
The Commission recommends  that the Director of Maritime  New Zealand  begin to collate 
national data on shipping movements around the New Zealand coast that will in future enable 
Maritime  New Zealand  and local government authorities to monitor the potential need to 
introduce ship routing of some form.  (014/14)  
7.6.1.  On 13 October 2014, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
The Director accepts this recommendation and notes that the Review of Coastal 
Navigation Safety currently underway (as per details provided in the response to 
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 57 >>
 recommendation 013/14) will specifically consider the issue of ship routing 
around the New Zealand Coast.  
 
  

<< Page 58 >>
 Final report 11 -204 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Ship managers  must ensure that their safety management system s are delivering safe ship 
operations for every ship in their  fleets. 
8.2. Ships' crews must comply with the mandatory requirements and recommended best industry 
practice for passage planning, navigation and watchkeeping if similar groundings and other 
equally catast rophic maritime casualties are to be avoided.  
8.3. Countries' maritime education, training and certification systems must be capable of meeting  
the standards required by the STCW Convention  to ensure that seafarers emerging from the 
system are trained to an app ropriate standard.

 Final report 11 -204 Appendix 5: Chronology of amendments to IMO STCW Convention  1978  
STCW 78 - Adoption: 7 July 1978  
Entry into force: 28 April 1984  
Amendment Procedure   
Amendments to the 1978 STCW Convention 's technical Annex may be adop ted by a Conference of 
STCW Parties or by IMO's Maritime Safety Committee, expanded to include all Contracting Parties, some 
of whom may not be members of the Organization.  
Amendments to the STCW Annex will normally enter into force one and a half years a fter being 
communicated to all Parties unless, in the meantime, they are rejected by one -third of the Parties or by 
Parties whose combined fleets represent 50 per cent of world tonnage.  
The 2010 amendments  
The Manila amendments to the STCW Convention and C ode were adopted on 25 June 2010, marking a 
major revision of the STCW Convention and Code. The 2010 amendments are set to enter into force on 
1 January 2012 under the tacit acceptance procedure and are aimed at bringing the Convention and 
Code up to date with developments since they were initially adopted and to enable them to address 
issues that are anticipated to emerge in the foreseeable future.  
Amongst the amendments adopted, there are a number of important changes to each chapter of the 
Convention an d Code, including:  
Improved measures to prevent fraudulent practices associated with certificates of competency and 
strengthen the evaluation process (monitoring of Parties' compliance with the Convention);  
Revised requirements on hours of work and rest and new requirements for the prevention of drug and 
alcohol abuse, as well as updated standards relating to medical fitness standards for seafarers;  
New certification requirements for able seafarers;  
New requirements relating to training in modern techno logy such as electronic charts and information 
systems (ECDIS);  
New requirements for marine environment awareness training and training in leadership and teamwork;  
New training and certification requirements for electro -technical officers;  
Updating of competence requirements for personnel serving on board all types of tankers, including 
new requirements for personnel serving on liquefied gas tankers;  
New requirements for security training, as well as provisions to ensure that seafarers are properly 
trained to cope if their ship comes under attack by pirates;  
Introduction of modern training methodology including distance learning and web -based learning;  
New training guidance for personnel serving on board ships operating in polar waters; an d  
New training guidance for personnel operating Dynamic Positioning Systems.  
The 2006 amendments  
Adoption: May 2006  
Entry into force: 1 January 2008  
  
Final report 11 -204 
<< Page 69 >>
 The amendments added new minimum mandatory training and certification requirements for persons to 
be desig nated as ship security officers (SSOs). The amendments to the STCW Convention and to parts A 
and B of the STCW Code include Requirements for the issue of certificates of proficiency for Ship 
Security Officers; Specifications of minimum standards of profici ency for ship security officers; and 
Guidance regarding training for Ship Security Officers.  
Further amendments to part A of the STCW Code added additional training requirements for the 
launching and recovery of fast rescue boats. The amendments have been prepared in response to 
reports of injuries to seafarers in numerous incidents involving the launching and recovery of fast 
rescue boats in adverse weather conditions.  
The 1998 Amendments  
Adoption: 9 December 1998  
Entry into force: 1 January 2003  
Amendmen ts to the STCW Code are aimed at improving minimum standards of competence of crews, in 
particular relating to cargo securing, loading and unloading on bulk carriers, since these procedures 
have the potential to put undue stresses on the ship's structure. The amendments concern sections A -
II/1 and A -II/2 under "Cargo handling and stowage at the operational and management levels ". 
The 1997 Amendments  
Adoption: June 1997  
Entry into force: 1 January 1999  
The amendments concern training for personnel on passenger ships. The amendments include an 
additional Regulation V/3 in Chapter V on Mandatory minimum requirements for the training and 
qualifications of masters, officers, ratings and other personnel on passenger ships other than ro -ro 
passenger ships. R elated additions are also made to the STCW Code, covering Crowd management 
training; Familiarization training; Safety training for personnel providing direct service to passengers in 
passenger spaces; Passenger safety; and Crisis management and human behav iour training.

The 1995 amendments  - a major revision  
The 1995 amendments, adopted by a Conference, represented a major revision of the Convention, in 
response to a recognized need to bring the Convention up to date and to respond to critics who pointed 
out the many vague phrases, such as "to the satisfaction o f the Administration ", which resulted in 
different interpretations being made.  
Others complained that the Convention was never uniformly applied and did not impose any strict 
obligations on Parties regarding implementation. The 1995 amendments entered into  force on 1 
February 1997. However, until 1 February 2002, Parties may continue to issue, recognize and endorse 
certificates which applied before that date in respect of seafarers who began training or seagoing 
service before 1 August 1998.  
One of the majo r features of the revision was the division of the technical annex into regulations, 
divided into Chapters as before, and a new STCW Code, to which many technical regulations have been 
transferred. Part A of the Code is mandatory while Part B is recommende d.  
Dividing the regulations up in this way makes administration easier and it also makes the task of 
revising and updating them more simple: for procedural and legal reasons there is no need to call a full 
conference to make changes to Codes.  
Some of the most important amendments adopted by the Conference concern Chapter I  - General 
Provisions. They include the following:  
Ensuring compliance with the Convention  
Parties to the Convention are required to provide detailed information to IMO concerning adminis trative 
measures taken to ensure compliance with the Convention. This represented the first time that IMO had 
been called upon to act in relation to compliance and implementation  - generally, implementation is 
down to the flag States, while port state control also acts to ensure compliance. Under Chapter I, 
regulation I/7 of the revised Convention, Parties are required to provide detailed information to IMO 
concerning administrative measures taken to ensure compliance with the Convention, education and 
training courses, certification procedures and other factors relevant to implementation.  
By 1 August 1998  - the deadline for submission of information established in section A -I/7 of the STCW 
Code  - 82 out of the 133 STCW Parties had communicated information o n compliance with the 
requirements of the revised Convention. The 82 Parties which met the deadline represent well over 90% 
of the world's ships and seafarers.  
The information is reviewed by panels of competent persons, nominated by Parties to the STCW 
Convention, who report on their findings to the IMO Secretary -General, who, in turn, reports to the 
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) on the Parties which fully comply. The MSC then produces a list of 
Parties in compliance with the 1995 amendments.  
The first li st of countries was approved by the MSC at its 73rd session held from 27 November to 6 
December 2000 - it included 71 countries and one Associate Member of IMO.  
Port state control  
The revised Chapter I includes enhanced procedures concerning the exercise o f port state to allow 
intervention in the case of deficiencies deemed to pose a danger to persons, property or the 
environment (regulation I/4). This can take place if certificates are not in order or if the ship is involved 
in a collision or grounding, if  there is an illegal discharge of substances (causing pollution) or if the ship 
is manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner, etc.  
Other regulations in chapter I include:  
Measures are introduced for watchkeeping personnel to prevent fatigue.

<< Page 71 >>
 Parties are r equired to establish procedures for investigating acts by persons to whom they have issued 
certificates that endanger safety or the environment. Penalties and other disciplinary measures must be 
prescribed and enforced where the Convention is not complied with.  
Technical innovations, such as the use of simulators for training and assessment purposes have been 
recognized. Simulators are mandatory for training in the use of radar and automatic radar plotting aids 
(regulation I/12 and section A -I/12 of the STC W Code).  
Parties are required to ensure that training, certification and other procedures are continuously 
monitored by means of a quality standards system (regulation I/8).  
Every master, officer and radio operator are required at intervals not exceeding f ive years to meet the 
fitness standards and the levels of professional competence contained in Section A -I/11 of the STCW 
Code. In order to assess the need for revalidation of certificates after 1 February 2002, Parties must 
compare the standards of compet ence previously required with those specified in the appropriate 
certificate in part A of the STCW Code. If necessary, the holders of certificates may be required to 
undergo training or refresher courses (regulation I/11).  
Chapter II: Master and deck depar tment  
The Chapter was revised and updated.  
Chapter III: Engine department  
The Chapter was revised and updated.  
Chapter IV: Radio communication and radio personnel  
The Chapter was revised and updated.  
Chapter V: Special training requirements for personnel on certain types of ships  
Special requirements were introduced concerning the training and qualifications of personnel on board 
ro-ro passenger ships. Previously the only special requirements in the Co nvention concerned crews on 
tankers. This change was made in response to proposals made by the Panel of Experts set up to look 
into ro -ro safety following the capsize and sinking of the ferry Estonia in September 1994. Crews on ro -
ro ferries have to receiv e training in technical aspects and also in crowd and crisis management and 
human behaviour.  
Chapter VI: Emergency, occupational safety, medical care and survival functions  
The Chapter incorporates the previous Chapter VI: Proficiency in survival craft and  includes mandatory 
minimum requirements for familiarization, basic safety training and instruction for all seafarers; 
mandatory minimum requirements for the issue of certificates of proficiency in survival craft, rescue 
boats and fast rescue boats; mandat ory minimum requirements for training in advanced firefighting; 
and mandatory minimum requirements relating to medical first aid and medical care.  
Chapter VII: Alternative certification  
Regulations regarding alternative certification (also known as the fu nctional approach) are included in a 
new Chapter VII. This involves enabling crews to gain training and certification in various departments of 
seafaring rather than being confined to one branch (such as deck or engine room) for their entire 
career.   Altho ugh it is a relatively new concept, the 1995 Conference was anxious not to prevent its 
development. At the same time, the new Chapter is intended to ensure that safety and the environment 
are not threatened in any way. The use of equivalent educational and  training arrangements is 
permitted under article IX.

 Final report 11 -204 Chapter VIII: Watchkeeping  
Measures were introduced for watchkeeping personnel to prevent fatigue. Administrations are required 
to establish and enforce rest periods for watchkeeping personnel and to ensure that watch systems are 
so arranged that the efficiency of watchkeeping personnel is not impaired by fatigue.  
The STCW Code  
The regulations contained in the Convention are supported by sections in the STCW Code. Generally 
speaking, the Convention con tains basic requirements which are then enlarged upon and explained in 
the Code.  
Part A of the Code is mandatory. The minimum standards of competence required for seagoing 
personnel are given in detail in a series of tables. Chapter II of the Code, for exa mple, deals with 
standards regarding the master and deck department.  
Part B of the Code contains recommended guidance which is intended to help Parties implement the 
Convention. The measures suggested are not mandatory and the examples given are only inten ded to 
illustrate how certain Convention requirements may be complied with. However, the recommendations 
in general represent an approach that has been harmonized by discussions within IMO and consultation 
with other international organizations.  
The "White  List"  
The first so -called "White list " of countries deemed to be giving "full and complete effect" to the revised 
STCW Convention (STCW 95) was published by IMO following the 73rd session of the Organization's 
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), meeting from  27 November to 6 December 2000.  
It is expected that ships flying flags of countries that are not on the "White List"  will be increasingly 
targeted by port state control  inspectors.  A Flag State  Party that is on the "White List"  may, as a matter 
of polic y, elect not to accept seafarers with certificates issued by non "White List"  countries for service 
on its ships. If it does accept such seafarers, they will be required by 1 February 2002 also to have an 
endorsement, issued by the flag State , to show that  their certificate is recognized by the flag State . 
By 1 February 2002, masters and officers should hold STCW 95 certificates or endorsements issued by 
the flag State. Certificates issued and endorsed under the provisions of the 1978 STCW Convention will 
be valid until their expiry date.  
The list will be kept under review and may be added to as other countries meet the criteria for inclusion.

 Appendix 6: IMO announcement - publication of White List  
 
71 countries make IMO's initial STCW White List  
 
Maritime Safety Committee - 73rd session: 27 November - 6 December 2000  
The so -called "White List " of countries deemed to be giving "full and complete effect " to the revised STCW Convention 
(STCW 95) has been published by IMO. The 73rd session of the Organization's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), 
meeting from 27 November to 6 December 2000, formally en dorsed the findings of a working group established to 
examine a report made by the Secretary -General to the MSC, which revealed that 71 countries and one Associate 
Member of IMO had met the criteria for inclusion on the list.  
The 1995 amendments to STCW (t he International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 
for Seafarers) which entered into force on 1 February 1997, revised and updated the original 1978 Convention, setting 
out clearly defined minimum competency requirements f or all seafarers and taking into account developments in 
technology since the 1978 Convention was adopted. A position on the White List entitles other Parties to accept, in 
principle, that certificates issued by or on behalf of the parties on the list are in compliance with the Convention.  
Tighter PSC targeting expected  
It is expected that ships flying flags of countries that are not on the White List will be increasingly targeted by Port State 
Control  inspectors. A Flag state Party that is on the White Li st may, as a matter of policy, elect not to accept seafarers 
with certificates issued by non White List countries for service on its ships. If it does accept such seafarers, they will be  
required by 1 February 2002 also to have an endorsement, issued by th e flag state, to show that their certificate is 
recognized by the flag state. By 1 February 2002, masters and officers should hold STCW 95 certificates or 
endorsements issued by the flag State. Certificates issued and endorsed under the provisions of the 1 978 STCW 
Convention will be valid until their expiry date.  
It was stressed at the meeting that giving "full and complete effect " to the revised Convention may not be the same for 
all Parties. Some may choose not to have any maritime training institutes at all and rely on recognition of certificates 
issued to seafarers by other states. Similarly, some Parties may only provide a limited scope of training, such as for 
ratings only.  
The fact that a Party is not listed on the White List does not invalidate cert ificates or endorsements issued by that Party. 
Nothing in the STCW Convention prevents the employment of any seafarer who holds a valid certificate or endorsement 
issued by a Party to the Convention. Nevertheless, the White List will become one of several criteria, including the 
inspection of facilities and procedures, that can be applied in the selection of properly trained and qualified seafarers. 
Countries not initially included in the White List will be able to continue with the assessment process with a view to 
inclusion on the list at a later stage.  
The publication of the list marks the end of the first stage of a ground -breaking verification procedure in which, for the 
first time, IMO has been given a direct role in the implementation of one of its in struments. Panels of experts have spent 
much of the past two years engaged in rigorous assessment of information presented to them by Parties to the 
Convention concerning their ability to meet the standards enshrined in STCW 95. Panel members were selected , as far as 
possible, to give a wide geographical spread and a broad coverage of the different facets of the Convention - deck and 
engineering knowledge, for example. These panels submitted their findings to IMO Secretary -General William O'Neil, who 
in tur n reported to the MSC which has now approved and issued the list.  
Challenging task  
For most countries, preparation of the submissions to the Secretary -General represented a demanding and challenging 
task. It required not only reporting on national laws, t raining requirements, standards and systems in place, but also 
ensuring that all of those elements met the revised Convention requirements and could pass the scrutiny of persons with 
detailed knowledge of those requirements.  
According to Mr O'Neil, the publication of the White List is a clear demonstration that the global regulatory process for 
shipping is taking ever greater account of the human element. He said, "The revised STCW Convention and the ISM 
Code, which takes full  effect in 2002, are both aimed squarely at addressing human issues in shipping. Although 
technical matters will retain their importance, improving the standards of seafarers is a vital part of the safety equation. 
The White List shows that the human eleme nt is taking its proper place in the industry's priorities. "  
Expanded role for IMO?  
Mr O'Neil also said he believed the verification process pointed the way towards a new and expanded role for IMO in the 
future. "The fact that the authority for assessing implementation of STCW 1995 was delegated to IMO by Member 
States, " he said, "indicates that the will to give the Organization a greater role in implementation does exist. " He added, 
"If this approach can be extended into other areas where quality assuranc e needs to be reinforced and the name of IMO 
would lend credibility, then IMO is ready to respond. "

 Final report 11 -204 It has been estimated that some 80 per cent of marine casualties are due in some part to human error. In setting out 
unambiguously which countries are meeti ng the latest standards and requirements, the White List marks a significant 
step forward in IMO's global effort to rid the world of sub -standard ships and shipping. For the first time, it provides an 
IMO "seal of approval " for countries that have properly  implemented the provisions of a Convention.
