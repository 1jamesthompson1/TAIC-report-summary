2011_204,012/14,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand promote, through the appropriate IMO forum, the importance of sharing amongst member states information regarding the quality of member states' maritime education, training and certification systems, including a consideration of making the five-yearly evaluations of member states' available to other member states.","Member States are required to undergo five-yearly independent evaluations of their seafarer training systems. However, those evaluations remain confidential between the IMO, the auditing States and the States being assessed. According to Regulation I/10, member States are required to verify for themselves the effectiveness of other States' maritime education, training and certification systems before recognising certificates issued by those States. However, this can only be realistically achieved through a full systemic audit of the seafarer training system. If this were to happen it is likely that the global training system would be unnecessarily overburdened. This safety issue could be resolved if reports made after the five-yearly independent evaluations were required to be made available to other member states.

2011_204,010/14,The Commission recommends that CIEL evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the issues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena do not affect other vessels within its fleet.,"On board the Rena, the master and crew were not following the navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the Rena's safety management system for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding.

With respect to port state control records, other vessels managed by CIEL also had a higher than average rate of deficiencies than the average for the Asia-Pacific region.

2011_204,013/14,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consider the use of virtual aids to navigation and monitor progress through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) of the development of performance criteria for them, but meanwhile work with regional councils and port companies to control the use of virtual aids to navigation until they have been fully assessed and appropriate performance criteria set by IATA and Maritime New Zealand.","It is probable that if an aid to navigation of some type had been installed on Astrolabe Reef, the Rena grounding would have been prevented. However, there are many such isolated dangers to navigation around the coast of New Zealand. Installing and maintaining physical navigational aids on remote hazards is costly. Virtual aids to navigation are potentially a cost-effective means of marking such isolated dangers. However, these are still being trialled by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities and no performance criteria have yet been set regarding their accuracy and intended use. The Commission noted during its inquiry that although the technology is relatively new and there is no regulatory framework in place, some port authorities are already beginning to use virtual aids to navigation. There is a potential safety issue around the use of aids to navigation that have not been fully tested.

2011_204,014/14,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand begin to collate national data on shipping movements around the New Zealand coast that will in future enable Maritime New Zealand and local government authorities to monitor the potential need to introduce ship routing of some form.,"There is insufficient data available on the New Zealand coast to make any meaningful analysis of shipping routes, density of ship traffic or potential areas of shipping convergence that might warrant the introduction of local ship routing systems.
