- name: Signal Compliance and Automatic Protection
  explanation: Signal compliance and the lack of automatic protection systems are central safety themes in this accident. The passenger train passed Signal 38 at red, which indicates a failure in signal compliance by the train driver ("Twenty seconds later the passenger train passed Signal 38 at red while travelling at 42 km/h with 15% braking applied" (4.2.1.8)). Additionally, the absence of an automatic signal trip device at Signal 38 meant there was no system in place to automatically stop the train in the event of such a signal breach ("Signal 38 was not equipped with a signal trip device, so in the event of an overrun there was no automatic means of stopping a train before it reached the crossover points" (3.2.4)).
- name: Driver Distraction
  explanation: Driver distraction is a significant safety theme in this incident. The driver of the passenger train was engaged in a conversation with the train manager, which led to missing the red signal at Signal 38 ("He also acknowledged that the reason for his not noticing the red signal was his becoming engrossed in his conversation with the train manager" (3.1.2)). This distraction is a recognized issue, as KiwiRail's records indicated that 42% of signals passed at red were partly or wholly attributable to driver distraction (3.3.3).
- name: Signaller Vigilance
  explanation: 'The vigilance of the signaller was a critical safety theme that prevented the collision. Upon noticing the passenger train''s failure to stop at Signal 38, the signaller immediately broadcast an urgent message to the train driver to stop, which led to the train halting before a collision could occur ("Meanwhile the signaller saw on his mimic screen that the passenger train had failed to stop at Signal 38. He immediately broadcast an urgent message over the local radio channel for the passenger train driver to stop his train" (4.2.1.9)).

- name: Risk Management at Converging Lines
  explanation: The management of risk at converging lines is a safety theme highlighted by this incident. The near collision occurred at a point where several busy metro passenger lines converge, which is a natural area of conflict requiring careful management ("The near collision occurred at the convergence of several busy metro passenger lines and there was no automatic protection applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a driver failing to stop at Signal 38" (3.1.5, 4.2.1)). The report suggests that this area lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent collisions in the event of human error.
- name: Adherence to Operating Rules
  explanation: Adherence to operating rules is a safety theme that was breached in this incident. KiwiRail's operating rules explicitly state that non-operational conversations with train drivers should be avoided to prevent distraction ("Locomotive Engineers must not participate in an attempted conversation where it is unsafe to do so. Conversations must be brief and confined to essential or urgent operating matters only" (3.3.1)). The driver and train manager's engagement in conversation was contrary to these rules, contributing to the near miss.
- name: Post-Incident Procedures and Testing
  explanation: The implementation of post-incident procedures and testing is a safety theme that was followed in this case. After the incident, the driver and train manager were relieved of their duties and underwent drug and alcohol testing, which returned negative results ("The driver and train manager on the passenger train were relieved of their duties. Both underwent post-incident drug and alcohol testing in accordance with KiwiRail's procedures, and both returned negative results" (4.2.1.10)). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the organization's commitment to safety and adherence to protocols following a safety-related incident.
