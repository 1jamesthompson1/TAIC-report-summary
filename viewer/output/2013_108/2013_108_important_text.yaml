  \ in a relatively low -speed area, where train speed was limited to \n20 km/h while\
  \ moving through the crossover points.  However, there was the potential for a \n\
  near 40 km/h head -on or glancing collision.  There would have been  a hig h risk\
  \ of injury to \npassengers and crew if the trains had collided.  \n3.1.2.  The\
  \ driver of the passenger train acknowledged that he had not see n Signal 38 displaying\
  \ \nred.  Trains from the Johnsonville Line almost always berthed at platform 1,\
  \ and for arriving \nmovem ents Signal 38 was almost always showing green - at least\
  \ that was the driver' s \nexpectation  in this instance .  He also acknowledged\
  \ that the reason for hi s not noticing the \nred signal was hi s becoming engrossed\
  \ in his conversation with the train manager.  \n3.1.3.  In this case a potential\
  \ collision was prevented by the signaller 's noticing  that the passenger \ntrain\
  \ had failed to stop at Signal 38.  Had he not done so  it is possible that the\
  \ trains would \nhave collided, but at what speed  it is difficult to say.  Whethe\
  \ r they collided, and at what \nspeed would depend if the driver of either train\
  \ recognised the potential collision , and if and \nwhen either fully braked their\
  \ train.  \n3.1.4.  If a collision had not occurred, the passenger train would probably\
  \ have \"run through \" and \ndamaged the 73 end of the crossover points, because\
  \ they were set for the passage of the \nempty (outbound ) train instead.  \n3.1.5.\
  \  Two safety issues were identified : \n1. The near collision occurred at the convergence\
  \ of several busy metro passenger lines \nand t here  was no automatic protection\
  \ applied to preventing such a collision in the \nevent of a driver failing to stop\
  \ at Signal 38 . \n2. There was a potential for drivers of metro passenger trains\
  \ to be distracted by non -\noperational interaction s with other train staff. \
  \ \n3.2. Automati c protection  \n3.2.1.  The area where the tracks from 9 platforms\
  \ converge and cross on  to 4 main lines is a \nnatural area of conflict that requires\
  \ careful management .  The area is controlled by a \ndedicated signaller operating\
  \ the signal box.  There are a number of signalling interlocks for \nmanaging conflicts\
  \ , but they essentially rely on train drivers seeing and complying with the \n\
  various signals.  \n3.2.2.  Of the 4 lines into and out of Wellington station, 2\
  \ are bi -directional , a third is for departing \ntrains only and the fo urth is\
  \ for arriving trains only.  The passenger train was arriving on one \nof the bi-directional\
  \ lines that was dedicated to Johnsonville Line services.  There are 2 other \n\
  lines on which trains can potentially arrive.   Each of those lines is protected\
  \ by a n equivalent \nsignal to Signal 384. \n3.2.3.  The equivalent  signals on\
  \ the other 2 lines  are Signal 39 and Signal 56.  These 2 signals are \nequipped\
  \ with signal trip devices  at ground level  (see Figure 3) .  The signal trip catches\
  \ on a \nbrake trip lever mounted low do wn on an electric train which automatically\
  \ applies the train's \nair brakes if the signal  is passed at red. \n         \
  \                                               \n4 Referred to as \"Home\" signals.\

  \ at Signal 39 (left) and the trip lever o n a Matangi train  (right ) \n3.2.4.\
  \  Signal 38 was not equipped with a signal trip device, so in the event of a n\
  \ overrun there was \nno automatic means of stopping a train before it reached the\
  \ crossover points.  The \nCommission has recommended that such a device be installed\
  \ . \n3.3. Driver distraction  \n3.3.1.  KiwiRail's operating rules stated in part\
  \  that: \n117. Prevention of Locomotive Engineer Distraction  \nLocomotive Engineers\
  \ must not participate in an attempted conversation where it \nis unsafe to do so.\
  \  Conversations must be brief and confined to essential or  \nurgent operating\
  \ matters only.  \n(1) On Railcars and Multiple Units with direct access to the\
  \ Locomotive Engineer, \nTrain Managers/Guards and Assistants must:  \nNot ride\
  \ in the driver's compartment or converse with the Locomotive Engineer \nexcept\
  \ on matters relatin g to the running of the train.  \n3.3.2.  KiwiRail had moved\
  \  the content of R ule 117 from its general rules section to its operating \nrules\
  \ section on 23 July 2012.  The Rule had been previously contained within a rule\
  \ that \nmostly detailed KiwiRail's response to adver se weather events.  KiwiRail\
  \ felt that the Rule \ndeserved its own number and it was more appropriate to be\
  \ located as an operating rule.  \n3.3.3.  Both the passenger train driver and the\
  \ train manager were aware that they should not have \nbeen engaging in idle convers\
  \ ation .  KiwiRail's records of signals being passed at red in the \nWellington\
  \ electrified network between J uly 1999 and September 2013 showed that there \n\
  had been  123 incidents during that period, of which 42% were partly or wholly attributable\
  \ to \ndriver distraction.  The records also showed that there had been one previous\
  \ similar \nincident at Signal 38 and 7 similar incidents at adjacent Signals 39\
  \ and 56  during th e same \nperiod . \n3.3.4.  Driving metro trains on a busy metro\
  \ passenger train network involves constant monitoring \nof signals.  The current\
  \ metro train network has a high reliance on train drivers seeing and \nresponding\
  \ to signals to prevent train collisions.  \n3.3.5.  This in cident is an example\
  \  of what can happen if a driver is distracted and fails to see an \nimportant\
  \ signal.  \n3.3.6.  The Commission has recommended that KiwiRail take measures\
  \ to address this safety \nissue.  \nsignal trip  \n \nReport RO -2013 -108 \n<<\

  \ or give notice of, recommendations to any person or \norganisation that it considers\
  \ the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, \ndepending on whether\
  \ these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the \nwider\
  \ transport sector.  In this case, recommendations have been issued to KiwiRail\
  \ and the \nNZ Transport Agency.  \n4.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety\
  \ it is important that these recommendations are \nimplemented without delay  to\
  \ help prevent  similar ac cidents or incidents occurring in the \nfuture.  \n4.2.\
  \ KiwiRail  \nRecommendation 1  \n4.2.1.  The near collision occurred at a convergence\
  \ of several busy metro passenger lines and \nthere was no automatic protection\
  \ applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a \ndriver  failing to\
  \ stop at Signal 38.  \nEquivalent signals protecting other lines into Wellington\
  \ station have been fitted with signal \ntrips that automatically apply a train's\
  \ brakes in the event of it overrunning the signal.  A \nsignal trip fitted to Signal\
  \ 38 woul d have automatically applied the passenger train brakes in \nthis case\
  \ . \nOn 23 October  2013,  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive\
  \ of KiwiRail \ninstall some form of protection that will automatically stop a train\
  \ that has overrun Signal 38 \nin the  Wellington Station area, and that he reviews\
  \ other signalling arrangements in busy, \nhigh risk metro passenger  areas to ensure\
  \ the same arrangements are in place to minimise \nthe risk of train collisions\
  \ for the same or similar reasons  (022/13) . \n4.2.2.  On 6 Novemb er 2013, the\
  \ Chief Executive of Kiwi Rail replied:  \nRecommendation 022/13 made to the Chief\
  \ Executive of Kiwi Rail is accep ted. \nA program to install a Signal trip at 38\
  \ Signal has been agreed.  Design is \nprogrammed for completion by end of January\
  \ 2014, and final commissioning by end \nof March 2014.  Concurrently the Signals\
  \ Engineering team will be undertaking a \nqualitative risk review of signalling\
  \ arrangements in the Wellington Metro area.  This \nwill also be expected to be\
  \ completed by end of March 2014.  \nRecommendation 2  \n4.2.3.  Driver distraction\
  \ has the potential to contribute to or cause  serious accidents and incidents.\
  \  \nIn this case the driver of the passenger train was distracted by engaging in\
  \  a non-operational \nconversation with the train manager, and failed to stop his\
  \ train at a red signal.  \n4.2.4.  On 23 October 2013, the Commission recommended\
  \ that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail \ntakes the necessary action to reinforce\
  \ to all staff the existing rule  forbidding non -\noperational conversation with\
  \ train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance \nwith the rule  (023/13).\
