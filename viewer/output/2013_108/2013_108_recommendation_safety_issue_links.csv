2013_108,024/13,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency takes all appropriate steps to ensure that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendations.,"The Commission has made 2 recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail, that he:

1. Install some form of protection that will automatically stop a train that has overrun Signal 38 in the Wellington station area, and that he review other signalling arrangements in busy, high-risk metro passenger areas to ensure that the same arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of train collisions for the same or similar reasons.

2. Take the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversations with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule.

On 23 October ","The near collision occurred at the convergence of several busy metro passenger lines and there was no automatic protection applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a driver failing to stop at Signal 38.

In this case the driver of the passenger train was distracted by engaging in a non-operational conversation with the train manager, and failed to stop his train at a red signal.

Equivalent signals protecting other lines into Wellington station have been fitted with signal trips that automatically apply a train's brakes in the event of it overrunning the signal. A signal trip fitted to Signal 38 would have automatically applied the passenger train brakes in this case.
