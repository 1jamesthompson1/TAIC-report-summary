  3.1. While transporting animal carcasses as part of an aerial hunting operation,\
  \ the helicopter \nand slung load struck the tree canopy and then the terrain. This\
  \ section discusses why \nthe helicopter struck the tree canopy and other factors\
  \ associated with this accident.  \n3.2. The following analysis also discusses the\
  \ various factors that could have contributed to \nthe accident, and the regulatory\
  \ regime around private recreation al aviation.  \nWhat happened  \n3.3. The data\
  \ recovered from the GPS (see Figure 4 ) recorded  the helicopter 's position at\
  \ 10 -\nsecond intervals .  The helicopter approached  the skid site from  an easterly\
  \ direction, \nwhich was  along the rising terrain  to the south of the  open area\
  \ . The helicopter then \nslowed , and landed at the skid site  near where the pilot\
  \ had left the pig earlier .  \n3.4. The GPS data showed the helicopter was on the\
  \ ground for approximately 30 seconds . \nDuring this period , the pilot would have\
  \ need ed to rearra nge the rope strop to attach \nboth animals . The GPS data then\
  \ showed the helicopter  lifting and departing . The last \nGPS data point , which\
  \  was approximately between the departure location and the \naccident site was\
  \ considered unreliable due to the accident se quence. Th e unreliability  of \n\
  Garmin GPS data just prior to an accident has been noted in previous  investigation\
  \ \nreports11. However, the pilot unlikely conducted any manoeuvres to gain altitude,\
  \ as this \nwould have resulted in additional GPS data points being  recorded. Instead,\
  \ the path was \nlikely similar to the earlier  flight path  (see Figure 4 ) with\
  \ a final turn onto the accident \nheading .  \n3.5. The tree damage indicated that\
  \ the helicopter was flying  approximately south -west \nimmediately before impact\
  \  (see Figure 4). While it indicated that the helicopter and load \nentered in\
  \ close proximity,  the final location s of the helicopter and its load were \n\
  separate. T he cargo hook was in the released position , which  indicated that the\
  \ pilot \nlikely jettisoned the load after the load  made contact with the tree\
  \ canopy. This suggests \nthat the pilot was conscious at the time of the accident\
  \ and was attempting to recover \nfrom the situation or minimise the consequences.\
  \  \n3.6. The damage observed on one of the main rotor blades  was consist ent with\
  \ the main \nrotor having 'coned '12. Similar damage was observed on the other blade\
  \ , but it was \nmasked by more significant impact damage from  a tree . Coning\
  \ is the result of power \nbeing delivered by an engine being insufficient to main\
  \ tain the  rotor bl ades' rotational \nspeed  under load . If the rotational speed\
  \ decreases below a critical limit (the low rotor -\nRPM limit), the situation is\
  \ unrecoverable. The illumination of the Low Rotor RPM caution \nlight was also\
  \ indicative of the main rotor being  at low RP M.  \n3.7. In regard to responding\
  \ to low rotor RPM, the  United States Federal Aviation \nAdministration  Helicopter\
  \ Flying Handbook (FAA, 2012)  recommended:  \nas soon as a low rotor rpm condition\
  \ is detected, apply additional throt tle if \nit is available. If there is no throttle\
  \ available, lower the collective . \n                                         \
  \               \n11 Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation report AO\
  \ -2011 -102, \n<< page 68 >>\n.  \n12 Bending upwards from the mast head more than\
  \ normal.  \nFinal Report AO -2017 -002 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 3.8. If the pilot had\
  \ experienced low rotor RPM while at a maximum power setting, the only \navailable\
  \ option s to recover the rotor RPM would have been  to lower the collective, \n\
  resul ting in a descent , or release the load . An examination of the drive train\
  \ showed that \nthe engine power setting was low just before impact . This indicated\
  \  that the pilot was \nlikely responding to a low rotor -RPM event at this time.\
  \  \n3.9. However, the damage to the  helicopter and the helicopter's descent path\
  \ through the \ntree canopy meant the investigation could not rule out a low rotor\
  \ -RPM and subsequent \nrotor -stall event occurring before the descent  through\
  \  the tree canopy . It was about as \nlikely as not that the l ow rotor -RPM event\
  \ occurred  as a result of the load becoming \nentangled with the tree s as the\
  \ pilot attempted to climb above them , which then led to \nthe descent through\
  \ them .  \nPossible contributing factors  \n3.10. The circumstances surrounding\
  \ the accident suggeste d that  either both the helicopter \nand the load inadvertently\
  \ made contact with the tree canopy , or the pilot was unable to \nmaintain sufficient\
  \ clearance from the tree canopy. The investigation considered what \nroles the\
  \ environmental conditions, the conditi on of the helicopter and the operation of\
  \ \nthe helicopter may have had in  the accident.  \nEnvironmental factors  \nUnfavourable\
  \ wind  \n3.11. The wind at the time  of the accident  was light and variable ,\
  \ but generally it was a \ntailwind from the south -east. During the Com mission's\
  \ inspection the day after the \naccident , late afternoon thermal activity was\
  \ observed at a similar time to the accident to \ncreate short periods of wind gusts\
  \ estimated at up to 20 knots in strength13 and from \nrandom directions. It was\
  \ possible that the pilot experienced a sudden tailwind gust \nduring take -off.\
  \ If a sudden tailwind gust had occurred, it would  have  reduce d the \nhelicopter's\
  \ rate of climb in a critical phase of flight. The pilot may not have recognised\
  \ \nthe cause , but would have seen the e ffect and likely have increased collective\
  \ to maintain \nthe height and climb angle to clear obstacles.  The extent to which\
  \ it contributed to the \naccident could not be determined.  \nVisual impairment\
  \  \n3.12. At the time of the accident the sun was low on the horizon directly ahead\
  \ of the flight \ntrack . The pilot was wearing a hat at the time of the accident,\
  \ but did not have \nsunglasses. It was possible that the pilot's  vision was affected\
  \ by the sun, and the trees \nbeing in shadow limited the pilot's ability to determin\
  \ e the helicopter's height above the \ntree canopy . The extent to which this contributed\
  \ to the accident could not be \ndetermined.  \nCarburettor ic ing conditions  \n\
  3.13. Carburettor icing conditions presented a moderate risk14 at the time of the\
  \ accident.  \n                                                        \n13 Based\
  \ on the Beaufort scale for land , it was termed a 'fresh breeze'  at 17 -21 knots\
  \ .  \n14 Acco rding to a standard risk chart published by the Civil Aviation Safety\
  \ Authority of Australia on its \nwebsite.  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report AO\
  \ -2017 -002 3.14. The Pilot 's Operating Handbook (RHC, 1979)  noted that ice formation\
  \ was possible in the \ninduction system when the air temperature was between -4\xB0\
  \ and 30\xB0 Celsius and the dew \npoint was 0-15\xB0 lower than the air temperature.\
  \ At 1800 the automa tic weather station in \nReefton recorded a temperature of\
  \ 18.9 \xB0, with a dew point 4\xB0 lower at 14.9 \xB0 and a \nrelative humidity\
  \ of 69%.   \n3.15. Robinson Helicopter Company discussed the risk of carburettor\
  \ ice in Safety Notice 25 \n(RHC, 2012) .  It advised that carburettor heat may\
  \ be necessary during take -off because \nthe engine responds to power demand from\
  \ aerodynamic loads rather than a fixed \nthrottle setting , so is more vulnerable\
  \ to the formation of induction ice. The carburettor \nheating  control was found\
  \ in the OFF position, but the carburettor was badly  damaged \nand the status could\
  \ not be confirmed at both ends of the control linkage.  \n3.16. While the previous\
  \ flights may suggest that icing conditions were not severe enough to \naffect \
  \ flight  significantly , the risk that ice formed in the carburettor during the\
  \ accident \nflight  still existed . Similarly, the perishable nature of the evidence\
  \ for assessing whether \nice formed in the induction system meant that the Commission\
  \ was unable to determine \nwhether it contributed to the accident .  \nCondition\
  \ of the helicopter  \n3.17. The condition of the helicopter at the time of the\
  \ accident had the potential to reduce \nthe available power from the engine , and\
  \ therefore the ability of the pilot to maintain \nsufficient c learance from the\
  \ tree canopy.  This section discusses the helicopter 's \ncondition at the time\
  \ of the accident and what effects  it may have had.  \nEngine performance  \n3.18.\
  \ The post -accident engine examination found debris in the combustion chambers\
  \ , which \nindicated  that the engine was likely running when the helicopter collided\
  \ with the tree \nstump .  \n3.19. An independent engineer examined the helicopter\
  \ 's engine for the Commission and \nmade the following observations:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the inlet and exhaust valve faces showed evidence of not sealing properly.  \n\
  Excessive carbon deposits had accumulated under the inlet valve heads  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the exhaust valve guide wear was greater than acceptable limits and greater than\
  \ \nusual for an engine at the stated life  \n\uF0B7 the crankcase bearing shells\
  \ were worn more th an expected for the engine life  \n\uF0B7 all spark plugs worked\
  \ when tested but the electrodes had worn beyond the \nmanufacturer's allowable\
  \ limits  (Champion Aerospace, 2014) . The spark gaps were \nalso excessive  (see\
  \ Figure 7 ) \n\uF0B7 the bottom set of spark plugs was the wrong type for the engine\
  \  \n\uF0B7 both  magnetos were working correctly and the timing was correct  \n\
  \uF0B7 accident  debris was present in the combustion  chambers  \n\uF0B7 the overall\
  \ engine wear suggested it was closer to the end of its reconditioned life  \nthan\
  \ at the start as  recorded in the logbook . \nFinal Report AO -2017 -002 \n<< Page\
  \ 13 >>\n 3.20. While the helicopter's engine was likely running just prior to impact,\
  \ the reliability and \nmaximum power available would have likely been affected\
  \ by the engine's poor \ncondition.  \n3.21. The helicopter had been opera ting\
  \ at a similar altitude and weight prior to the accident \nflight ; however , the\
  \ issues identified may have resulted in the engine not providing the \ndesired\
  \ power when  demand ed. The extent to which this contributed to the accident \n\
  could not be determined.  \nFigure 7: Spark plug condition  \nFuel exhaustion  \n\
  3.22. It was unlikely that the helicopter ran out of fuel. The fuel tank ruptured\
  \ during the crash \nsequence  and the tank was empty . However, fuel was observed\
  \ in the fuel system and \nthe fil ter was clean. Witnesses observed the pilot fill\
  \ ing the fuel tank before take -off, to \nwhat appeared to be the full capacity\
  \ of the fuel tank. The fuel consumed prior to the \naccident was estimated from\
  \ GPS -recorded flight times. This calculation showed that  the \nhelicopter should\
  \ have had about one hour of usable fuel remaining at the time of the \naccident.\
  \   \nHelicopter loading  \n3.23. The helicopter was likely to have been operating\
  \ within normal load limits at the time of \nthe accident.  \n3.24. The helicopter's\
  \ maximum allowed gross weight was 590 kilograms . The last weight and \nbalance\
  \ data for the helicopter and the weights of the pilot, load, known items on  board\
  \ \nand calculated fuel remaining were used to determine the approximate weight\
  \ and \nbalance.  \nreference spark \nplug \nelectrode  \ncorrosion  \nincorrect\
  \ type  \nexcessive wear  \n excessive gap  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO\
  \ -2017 -002 3.25. When the pilot took of f from the skid site with both carcasses\
  \ , the estimated weight was \nabout  eight kilograms  under the maximum gross weight.\
  \  \nOperation of the helico pter \n3.26. There were marks on the ground where the\
  \ pilot had dragged the second carcass across \nto the helicopter and  hooked it\
  \ on, but there were no other drag marks leading away \nfrom where the helicopter\
  \ lifted off.  This shows that the helicopter had sufficient power \navailable for\
  \ the pilot to establish a hover high enough to lift the load clear of the \nground\
  \ . However,  the pilot  still needed to climb the helicopter during the take -off\
  \ to \nclear the obstacles along the flight path  safely . To achieve this, several\
  \ techniques were \navailable . \n3.27. Robinson Helicopter Company describe d the\
  \ standard  take-off technique in the 'Norma l' \nsection of the Pilot's Operating\
  \ Handbook  as, once a stable hover has been achieved , to \n\"lower nose and accelerate\
  \ to climb speed following profile shown by height -velocity \ndiagram in Section\
  \ 5\".  (See Appendix 1 for the referred height -velocity diagram .) The \ndiagram\
  \ showed the helicopter flying level below 10 f eet (three metres)  above ground\
  \ \nlevel until around 40 knots, at which point a climb could be initiated.  \n\
  3.28. Another technique was a maximum performance take -off, which was used to \
  \ clear \nnearby obstac les in the flight path. The technique , as described in\
  \ the Principles of \nHelicopter Flight  (Wagtendonk, 1996) , involved using the\
  \ maximum available power to \nclimb at  a steep angle . The condition of the engine\
  \ , as discussed in t he previous section , \nand the limited evidence available\
  \  meant that it was not possible to determine if the \npilot used this technique\
  \ and did not ha ve sufficient power, or if another technique was \nused to depart\
  \ the skid site.  \n3.29. There are several factors that  a pilot must consider\
  \ when planning and executing a take -\noff and departure . If a path over clear\
  \ terrain is available for the helicopter to gain \nsufficient altitude and airspeed,\
  \ it provides a better opportunity to land the helicopter  \nsafely in an emergen\
  \ cy.  \n3.30. While the exact take -off technique  and profile  could not be established,\
  \ the area \nadjacent to  the densely forested accident site  was clear er terrain\
  \ . The clear er terrain also \nextended in the direction of the helicopter's track.\
  \  Clear and descending  terrain was also \navailable on a north -easterly track\
  \ from the skid site. The investigation was unable  to \ndetermine if the pilot\
  \ had sufficient time or control of the helicopter to direct it towards \na more\
  \ suitable area before striking  the tree canopy .  \nFinal Report AO -2017 -002\
  \ \n<< Page 15 >>\n Figure 8: Clear  and descending  terrain adjacent to the accident\
  \ site  \n(looking west and north -west)  \nHelicopter airworthiness and regulatory\
  \ aspects  \nUnapproved maintenance  \n3.31. The CAA permitted a n owner/pilot to\
  \ carry out limited preventive maintenance as listed \nin Appendix A of Part 43\
  \  of the Civil Aviation Rules and in the Pilot 's Operating \nHandbook . For the\
  \ accident helicopter, t his include d the replacement of spark plugs.  All \nwork\
  \ should have been carried out in accordance with the maint enance manual and have\
  \ \nbeen recorded in the aircraft log. The detailed examinati on of the airframe\
  \ and the \naircraft logbooks revealed the following maintenance issues : \n\uF0B7\
  \ a dent in the tail rotor blade had not been patched in accordance with the \n\
  Robinson Heli copter Company R22 maintenance manual  \n\uF0B7 the battery system\
  \ had an unapproved modification that included non -aviation \ncomponents  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the handheld  GPS installation was an unapproved modification that included non\
  \ -\naviation components  \n\uF0B7 the under surface of the main r otor blades had\
  \ started to delaminate and had an \nunapproved repair that was not in accordance\
  \ with any Robinson Helicopter \nCompany maintenance procedures . The bonding strip\
  \ showed signs of glue failure  \nhaving already started  \n\uF0B7 the engine -hour\
  \ meter had been disabled  by modifying the wiring and fitting non-\naviation components.\
  \  \n3.32. None of the maintenance issues mentioned above was likely to have contributed\
  \ to the \naccident. However, they should have been addressed  by a qualified ,\
  \ licensed aircraft \nmaintenance eng ineer and in accordance with the maintenance\
  \ manual to ensure that \nthey did not adversely affect the helicopter's performance.\
  \  \nAirworthiness  \n3.33. No helicopter flights had been logged in the technical\
  \ log for at least the previous  12 \nmonths , and the hour meter  showed it had\
  \ flown seven  hours. The pilot's most recent  \nlogged flight in the helicopter\
  \ had been  on 26 July 2015 , but the GPS data indicated that \nthe helicopter had\
  \ flown since . The GPS logged every flight to the capacity of its memory \naccident\
  \ site  \nclearer terrain along \ntrack \naccident site  \ndescending terrain to\
  \ \nnorth  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2017 -002 and it had recorde d 25\
  \ hours ' flight time in the previous  three months. Based on the \npilot's fuel\
  \ card purchases and an average fuel consumption rate for the helicopter, the \n\
  pilot had purchased enough fuel for 45 hours ' helicopter flying time in the previous\
  \ 12 \nmonths. The engine had logged 327.7 hours since its last major overhaul and\
  \ seven in \nthe previous  12 months , but evidence of the actual engine wear indicated\
  \ many  more  \nhours than that .  \n3.34. For an aircraft to remain  airworthy\
  \ and safe for flight it must be operated and ma intained \nin accordance with the\
  \ Civil Aviation Rules.  A number of factors would have affect ed the \nhelicopter's\
  \ airworthiness : \n\uF0B7 the main rotor blades had exceeded their 12 -year finite\
  \ calendar life by eight \nmonths  \n\uF0B7 the engine -hour meter had been disabled\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the technical log had not been used to record flight hours for nearly\
  \ 12 months \nsince the most recent  maintenance  \n\uF0B7 unapproved  maintenance\
  \ and modifications had been carried out on the \nhelicopter  \n\uF0B7 the review\
  \  of airworthiness  had expired without a time extension  \n\uF0B7 the Pilot's\
  \ Operating Handbook  and technical log  were not carried in the helicopter  \n\uF0B7\
  \ a fire extinguisher was not fitted . \nConduct of the aerial hunting operation\
  \  \n3.35. The hunt manager reported that they had introduced the hunter to the\
  \ pilot, but had not \nbeen involved in negotiating any costs or terms of the flight\
  \ . The hunt manager recalled \nthat the hunter had discussed the flight with the\
  \ pilot and had agreed to pay for the \nflight. The amount that the hunter had agreed\
  \ to pay far exceeded the actual cost of the \nfuel for the flight. As such, it\
  \ is likely that the pilot was intending to carry the hunter for \nreward  without\
  \ holding a commercial pilot licence  or operating under an air operator \ncertificate\
  \ . Under the  Civil Aviation Rules  a pilot was required to have a commercial pilot\
  \ \nlicence to take passengers for hire or rewar d and that operation needed to\
  \ be conducted \nunder an air operator certificate. These requirements were in place\
  \ to ensure that a high \nlevel of safety was afforded to these operations.  \n\
  CAA oversigh t of private aircraft owners and pilots  \n3.36. The investigation\
  \ found multiple  examples of the pilot /owner  operating outside the \nprivileges\
  \ extended to  a private pilot or aircraft owner and not complying with the Civil\
  \ \nAviation Rules. Therefore the investigation  broadly examined the CAA oversight\
  \ of \nprivate aircraft owners and pilots.  \n3.37. The CAA's regulatory principles\
  \ for and approach to regulating safety in the civil aviation \nsystem were described\
  \ in its Regulatory Operating Model (CAA,  2014) . These principles  \nand approach\
  \  underpinned the CAA's strategic direction and underlying policies and \nprocedures.\
  \  \n3.38. To implement the Regulatory Operating Model, the CAA directed its activities\
  \ using a \nconsequence -based approach. It allocated its fini te operating resources\
  \ where it believed \nthe greatest consequences of non -compliance lay - commercial\
  \ and air transport \nFinal Report AO -2017 -002 \n<< Page 17 >>\n operations. Fewer\
  \  regulatory resources were allocated to the non -commercial sector , \nwhere the\
  \ CAA believed there were \"lower consequence s of failure and impact on the \n\
  safety of third parties\". This concept is depicted in Figure 9. \n \nFigure 9:\
  \ Nature of activity conducted  and CAA resource allocation  \n3.39. Under this\
  \ regulatory environment, the CAA  relied on non -commercial aviation \nparticipants\
  \ being responsible for safety and complying with regulatory requirements, \nand\
  \ to a lesser extent on regulatory and surveillance activities.  \n3.40. The allocation\
  \ of fewer  resources to the regulation of the non -comme rcial sector and a \n\
  reliance on its participants being  responsible for safety and comply ing with regulatory\
  \ \nrequirements were  broadly in accordance with  the International Civil Aviation\
  \ \nOrgani zation 's (ICAO 's) International Standards and Recommended Practic es\
  \ - Annex 6, \nOperation of Aircraft, Part II:  \nThe [ICAO Air Navigation] Commission\
  \  endorsed the philosophy established \nduring initial development of the Annex\
  \ that the owner and pilot -in-\ncommand must assume responsibility for the safety\
  \ of operations in no n-\ncommercial operations where travel is not open to the\
  \ general public. In \nsuch operations the Standards and Recommended Practices need\
  \ not be as \nprescriptive as those in Annex 6, Part I, due to the inherent self\
  \ -responsibility \nof the owner and pilot -in-command. The State does not have\
  \ an equivalent \n\"duty of care\" to protect the occupants as it does for fare\
  \ -paying customers \nin commercial operations . \n3.41. When non -commercial aviation\
  \ participants do not take self -responsibility  for \ncompliance with regulatory\
  \ req uirements, regulatory and surveillance activities are the \nonly control s\
  \ in place to provide safety assurance. In the non -commercial sector of \naviation,\
  \ this is principally through the Inspection Authori sation  system and the Aviation\
  \ \nRelated Concerns system .  \n3.42. The Inspection Authori sation  system incorporates\
  \ review s of airworthiness conducted on \na periodic basi s by Inspection Authori\
  \ sation  holder s. Individuals  who hold certificate s of \n\n\n<< Page 18 >>\n\
  \ Final Report AO -2017 -002 Inspection Authori sation  are monitored and reviewed\
  \ by the CAA using a risk -based \napproach  to ensure they perform their inspections\
  \ in accordance with the CAA's \nexpectations . The pilot/owner of the helicopter\
  \ had allowed the  helicopter's  review of \nairworthiness to expire before  the\
  \ accident.  \n3.43. The Aviation Related Concerns system w as based on the public\
  \ and other aviation \nparticipants making submissions to the CAA regarding concerns\
  \ about aviation matters. \nSome aviation participants interviewed for this investigation\
  \ had had concerns that the \npilot was not fully compliant with the Civil Aviation\
  \ Rules . These participants had not \nsubmit ted their concerns using the Aviation\
  \ Related Concerns system  as they had \nbelieved it was the responsibility of the\
  \ CAA to identify and investigate any irregularities. \nIn addition, they had believed\
  \ tha t reporting concerns to the CAA may have reputational \nimpact s on them within\
  \ the small aviation community. The limitation of the Aviation \nRelated Concerns\
  \ system within small communities affects its effectiveness in controlling \nrisk.\
  \  \n3.44. The pilot had gained a private pilot licence. It is therefore reasonable\
  \ to conclude that \nthe pilot understood the privileges granted by the issue of\
  \ that licence and the \nrequirement to comply with the Civil Aviation Rules. The\
  \ CAA regulatory and surveillance \ncontrols broadly aligned with international\
  \ standards and recommendations and were  \nbased on that premise.  The CAA did\
  \ not detect non -compliance in this instance, nor is it \nreasonable to expect\
  \ that it  would  have . The investigation was unable to determine why \nthe pilot\
  \ did not comply with the Civil Aviation Rules or the extent to which the non -\n\
  compliance contributed to the accident .  However, this accident serves as a reminder\
  \ to \npilots of their responsibility to operate within the privileges of their\
  \ licences and in \naccord ance with the Civil Aviation Rules.  \n \n  \nFinal Report\
