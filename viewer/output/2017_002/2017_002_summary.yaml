- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot conducted a commercial flight, which was beyond the privileges of the pilot's private pilot licence (4.7). Additionally, the Civil Aviation Authority's regulatory and surveillance controls in place for the non-commercial aviation sector were not effective in detecting the pilot's non-compliance (4.8). This indicates that regulatory compliance and safety management were relevant safety issues.
- name: Situational Awareness

- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The investigation was unable to determine conclusively why the helicopter struck the tree canopy and subsequently the terrain. However, it was likely due to either the engine not delivering the demanded power or the pilot inadvertently not maintaining a suitable clearance above the tree canopy (4.5). This suggests that human error was a contributing factor.
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 10
