- name: Low Rotor RPM and Engine Performance
  explanation: Low rotor RPM is a critical safety theme in this accident, as it is indicative of insufficient power being delivered by the engine to maintain the rotor blades' rotational speed under load. The report states that "the damage observed on one of the main rotor blades was consistent with the main rotor having 'coned'" and "the illumination of the Low Rotor RPM caution light was also indicative of the main rotor being at low RPM" (3.6). Furthermore, the engine's poor condition, as evidenced by "excessive carbon deposits," "exhaust valve guide wear," and "worn crankcase bearing shells," likely affected its reliability and maximum power output (3.19, 3.20). This theme is relevant because the helicopter's ability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tree canopy and perform necessary maneuvers was likely compromised by the engine's inability to deliver the required power.
- name: Environmental Conditions
  explanation: Environmental conditions, such as wind and visual impairment, are a significant safety theme in this accident. The wind at the time of the accident was "light and variable, but generally it was a tailwind from the south-east," which could have reduced the helicopter's rate of climb during a critical phase of flight (3.11). Additionally, the sun was low on the horizon directly ahead of the flight track, potentially impairing the pilot's vision and ability to determine the helicopter's height above the tree canopy (3.12). These factors are relevant as they could have influenced the pilot's ability to maintain control and situational awareness during the flight, contributing to the collision with the tree canopy.
- name: Helicopter Maintenance and Airworthiness
  explanation: The maintenance and airworthiness of the helicopter are central safety themes, as the investigation revealed several maintenance issues that were not addressed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions or the Civil Aviation Rules. For instance, "a dent in the tail rotor blade had not been patched in accordance with the Robinson Helicopter Company R22 maintenance manual" and "the under surface of the main rotor blades had started to delaminate and had an unapproved repair" (3.31). Additionally, the helicopter's "main rotor blades had exceeded their 12-year finite calendar life by eight months" (3.34). These issues are relevant because they could have compromised the helicopter's structural integrity and performance, potentially contributing to the accident.
- name: Pilot Decision-Making and Flight Path Selection
  explanation: Pilot decision-making and flight path selection are crucial safety themes, as the pilot chose to fly over densely forested terrain when alternative paths with less risk were available. The report notes that "the helicopter lifted off and the pilot flew over densely forested terrain, when alternative flight paths were available that offered less risk in the event of an aircraft emergency" (4.4). This theme is relevant because the pilot's decisions regarding the flight path directly affected the outcome of the emergency situation, as the helicopter collided with the tree canopy during an attempt to recover from a low rotor RPM event.
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Oversight
  explanation: Regulatory compliance and oversight are significant safety themes, as the pilot was found to be operating outside the privileges of a private pilot and not in compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules. The report indicates that "the pilot was intending to carry the hunter for reward without holding a commercial pilot licence or operating under an air operator certificate" (3.35). Moreover, the CAA's regulatory and surveillance controls for the non-commercial aviation sector were based on the assumption that participants would be responsible for safety and comply with regulatory requirements (3.40). This theme is relevant because the lack of adherence to regulations and oversight mechanisms may have allowed unsafe practices to go undetected, potentially contributing to the accident.
- name: Carburettor Icing Conditions
  explanation: Carburettor icing conditions are a pertinent safety theme, as they presented a moderate risk at the time of the accident and could have affected engine performance. The Pilot's Operating Handbook noted the possibility of ice formation in the induction system under certain temperature and humidity conditions, which were present during the accident (3.14). Although the carburettor heating control was found in the OFF position, the carburettor's damage prevented confirmation of its status at the time of the accident (3.15). This theme is relevant because carburettor icing could have contributed to a reduction in engine power, affecting the helicopter's ability to maintain altitude and clear obstacles.
