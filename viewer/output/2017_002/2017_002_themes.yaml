- name: Low Rotor RPM Event
  explanation: The theme of a low rotor RPM event is relevant to this accident as it is a critical factor that affects the helicopter's ability to maintain lift and control. The report indicates that "a low-rotor-speed event likely occurred" (4.1) and that the damage observed on the main rotor blades was consistent with the main rotor having 'coned' (3.6), which is a result of insufficient power to maintain the rotor blades' rotational speed under load. The illumination of the Low Rotor RPM caution light further supports this theme (3.6). The pilot's response to a low rotor RPM condition, as recommended by the FAA, would have been to apply additional throttle or lower the collective (3.7), but the engine power setting was low just before impact, indicating that the pilot was likely responding to a low rotor-RPM event at this time (3.8).
- name: Engine Performance and Maintenance
  explanation: Engine performance and maintenance is a significant safety theme in this accident. The engine's condition could have prevented it from producing maximum specified power, which is crucial for maintaining flight, especially during take-off with a heavy load (4.3). The report details that the engine had various issues, such as not sealing properly, excessive wear, and incorrect spark plug types (3.19). These findings suggest that the helicopter had not been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and the Civil Aviation Rules (4.6). The engine's poor condition likely affected the reliability and maximum power available, which could have contributed to the accident (3.20).
- name: Environmental Conditions
  explanation: Environmental conditions at the time of the accident are a relevant safety theme because they can significantly impact the pilot's ability to control the aircraft. The report mentions that the wind was light and variable but generally a tailwind from the southeast (3.11), and there were short periods of wind gusts that could have reduced the helicopter's rate of climb during a critical phase of flight (3.11). Additionally, the sun was low on the horizon directly ahead of the flight track, which could have affected the pilot's vision and ability to determine the helicopter's height above the tree canopy (3.12). These environmental factors had the potential to affect the safe conduct of the flight (4.2).
- name: Flight Path and Obstacle Clearance
  explanation: The chosen flight path and obstacle clearance are critical safety themes, as they determine the risk exposure during flight. The report indicates that the helicopter lifted off and flew over densely forested terrain when alternative flight paths were available that offered less risk in the event of an aircraft emergency (4.4). The pilot's inability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tree canopy could have been a factor in the accident (4.5). The investigation could not conclusively determine why the helicopter struck the tree canopy, but it was likely due to either engine power issues or the pilot not maintaining suitable clearance (4.5).
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Pilot Conduct
  explanation: Regulatory compliance and pilot conduct are safety themes that address the adherence to aviation rules and the responsibilities of the pilot. The report found that the pilot conducted a commercial flight without holding a commercial pilot license or operating under an air operator certificate, which was beyond the privileges of the pilot's private pilot license (4.7). Additionally, the helicopter had not been maintained in accordance with the Civil Aviation Rules, and there were multiple examples of the pilot/owner operating outside the privileges extended to a private pilot or aircraft owner (3.36). This non-compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules is a safety issue that could adversely affect the safety of future operations (3.44).
- name: CAA Oversight and Safety Assurance
  explanation: The Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) oversight and safety assurance mechanisms are a safety theme that pertains to the effectiveness of regulatory controls in ensuring aviation safety. The report discusses the CAA's allocation of fewer regulatory resources to the non-commercial sector, relying on participants being responsible for safety and complying with regulatory requirements (3.38). However, when participants do not take self-responsibility for compliance, regulatory and surveillance activities are the only controls in place to provide safety assurance (3.41). The investigation found that the pilot/owner had allowed the helicopter's review of airworthiness to expire before the accident, and the CAA did not detect non-compliance in this instance (3.42). This theme highlights the importance of effective oversight and the challenges in controlling risk within the non-commercial aviation sector (3.44).
