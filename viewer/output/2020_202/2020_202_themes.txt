Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Malfunctioning main engine: The main engine of the vessel was unable to generate full power due to a malfunctioning fuel injection control unit. This resulted in the vessel losing control and deviating from the channel.

2. Ineffective communication: There was a lack of effective communication between the master and chief engineer, leading to the master being unaware of the malfunctioning main engine prior to departure. This lack of communication hindered the bridge team's ability to address the issue and inform the pilot.

3. Adverse environmental conditions: The vessel embarked on a pilotage passage in marginal environmental conditions, which exceeded the safety considerations in the pilotage plan. The combination of the malfunctioning main engine and adverse environmental conditions rendered the vessel's navigational control ineffective.

4. Crew resource management: There was a lack of departmental communication between the engine room and the bridge, specifically between the master and chief engineer. This lack of communication hindered the flow of safety-critical information and affected the decision-making process.

5. Port of Tauranga safe operating procedures: The environmental conditions at the time of departure were at the upper end of the allowable limits described in the port's safety management plan. The vessel's main engine malfunction was not relayed to the pilot prior to departure, highlighting the need for a reassessment of the allowable weather windows for pilotage.

6. Injection control unit malfunction: The malfunction of the injection control unit was likely caused by coking debris that had entered the system and interfered with the operation of the valves. The use of low-sulphur fuel contributed to the coking and affected the performance of the marine diesel engine. The lack of a comprehensive document addressing the effects of low-sulphur fuel on injection control unit maintenance further complicated the situation.
