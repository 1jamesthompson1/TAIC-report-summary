  \ opening door on any aircraft is a serious event, more so on a \npressurised aircraft\
  \ where the force of the opening could result in secondary damage that could \n\
  affect  the control of the aeroplane.  The procedures for ensu ring door security\
  \ are therefore \ncritical.  \n4.2. The incident was a result of the door not being\
  \ closed properly by the loader and then the first \nofficer not checking that it\
  \ was locked as he was requir ed to do .  It also involved a number of \nunchecked\
  \ assumption s being made by the loader, first officer and captain about the actions\
  \ or \nintended actions of others.  The DDPG requirement for a crew member to check\
  \ the security of \nthe cargo door rather than rely on the loader was a defence7\
  \ against the door inadverten tly not \nbeing closed properly, which replaced the\
  \ usual defence provided by the door -closed \nannun ciator in the cockpit.  The\
  \ crew not following that requirement removed that defence . \n4.3. The original\
  \ fault of the cargo door annunciator light remaining illumina ted after the door\
  \ was \nclosed and locked was not critical provided a crew member visually confirmed\
  \ the door was \nlocked.  However, during the final walk -around inspection the\
  \ first officer was interrupted in his \ntask, by having to remove the cone at the\
  \ re ar of the aeroplane  and then seeing  the chocks had \nbeen removed.  The practice\
  \ of allowing  a loader to close and lock the cargo door probably led \nthe first\
  \ officer to believe the loader had done so on this occasion, but this was no defence\
  \ for \nhim not to f ollow a specific instruction; to check it himself .  The faded\
  \ paint on the visual lock \nindicator meant positive confirmation of the door being\
  \ closed required a close -up check of the \nindicator, but the checker needed to\
  \ be close anyway in order to check th e sight glass.  \n4.4. The need to remove\
  \ the cone from near the rear of the aeroplane should not have been a \nconcern\
  \  as this was commonly required .  The removal of the nose wheel chocks was not\
  \ normal \nand was a greater distraction for the first officer.  When in terrupted\
  \ during  a checklist or routine, \nthe person running the checklist  should return\
  \ to the point in the checklist where he or she was \ninterrupted  from task, or\
  \ if that is unclear, start the routine again.   \n4.5. The closed -circuit television\
  \ recording sugge sted that the loader was waiting by the cargo door \nfor the last\
  \ passenger to arrive.  The majority of passengers did not utili se the fast bag\
  \ trolley \nservice, so probably in anticipation that there would be no final baggage\
  \ being placed on the \nfast bag tro lley he pulled the cargo door down and rotated\
  \ the handle, probably to about the \nhorizontal position.  The loader could not\
  \ recall if this action was intended to lock the door or \nsimply catch the door\
  \ to stop it swinging open.  After the last passenger had passed the trolley \n\
  and boarded the aeroplane, the loader moved forward to remove the nose -wheel chocks\
  \ and \ntrolley in preparation for the start.   \n4.6. The loader had, however,\
  \ forgotten that external power was to be used for the start , so the \nchocks needed\
  \ to  remain in place until after the start.  As the first officer returned towards\
  \ the \naeroplane after removing the safety cone at the rear, he saw the loader\
  \ had removed the \nchocks , so went directly to the loader to instruct him to replace\
  \ the chocks.  The fi rst officer \npossibly looked in the direction of the cargo\
  \ door as he passed the left side of the aeroplane, \nand seeing the handle was\
  \ in about the horizontal and locked position he assumed the loader \nhad closed\
  \ and locked it.  It was not uncommon for a loader to close and lock the cargo door\
  \ , \nallowing the first officer to return almost directly to the flight deck. \
  \ The cargo door annunciator \nlight in the cockpit was the final defence for the\
  \ pilot to know the door was closed and locked.  \nWith the fault i n the micro\
  \ -switch that defence was removed but replaced by the additional \nrequirement\
  \ that a pilot physically check the door.  An additional defence would be  to require\
  \ \nanyone permitted to close an aircraft external door to complete the process\
  \ and lock t he door, \neven if another person is responsible for cross -checking\
  \ that it has been done.  \n4.7. After the first officer had completed his pre -flight\
  \ inspection and re -entered the aeroplane in \npreparation for engine start, the\
  \ crew reportedly discussed the illumin ated \"cargo door open \" \nannun ciator\
  \ light.  Both pilots were satisfied the door had been checked as required and was\
  \ \nclosed and locked.  However, the final walk -around inspection and checking\
  \ of the cargo door \nwas a repetitive exercise undertaken numerous t imes each\
  \ day, with the actions possibly \n                                            \
  \            \n7 The term \"defence\" is used to describe a measure taken to remove,\
  \ mitigate or protect against a hazard, as used by \nProfessor James Reason\u201F\
  s in his model on accident causation, commonly called \"The Swiss Cheese Model\"\
  .  \n  \nReport 10 -004 \n<< Page 9 >>\n becoming automated.  The discussion between\
  \ the 2 pilots was not robust enough to challenge \nthe mindset that the first officer\
  \ had probably formed : that the loader had closed and locked the \ndoor.  \n4.8.\
  \ The operator\u201Es pil ots were instructed in \"threat and error management \"\
  \ (TEM) as part of their \nnormal training cycle s.  TEM provided a systemic approach\
  \ to aviation safety, giving a \nframework for understanding and directing human\
  \ performance.  The u se of these TEM skills by \nthe crew could have prevented\
  \ the incident.  If both pilots had recognised when reviewing the \nmaintenance\
  \ log before flight that the defective cargo door warning system was a \"threat\
  \ \" to \nsafety of flight, they almost certainly would have paid close atte ntion\
  \ to the DDPG requirement \nfor a crew member to confirm visually that the door\
  \ was locked before flight.  Further, prior to \nengine start the crew could have\
  \ confirmed what specific actions the first officer had taken to \nensure the threat\
  \ was managed, fo r example that the handle had been confirmed locked and \nthe\
  \ indicators checked.   \n4.9. An e xamination of the handle confirmed that it was\
  \ possible to align the handle about \nhorizontal, but owing to the play in the\
  \ handle the locks would not engage until the han dle had \nbeen pushed firmly slightly\
  \ past the horizontal and the button had popped.  The fading of the \nbutton colour\
  \  degraded its effectiveness as an indicator  and as a warning to pilots that the\
  \ door \nwas possibly insecure .   \n4.10.  With the locks not being fully engaged,\
  \ the vibration generated during the taxi to the take -off \nposition was sufficient\
  \ to cause the locks to back  off.  The locks finally released and the door \nopened\
  \ at about the point of rotation during take -off.  The take -off speed is lower\
  \ than the \nspeed the aeroplane normally achieves in the cruise.  Had the door\
  \ opened while the aeroplane \nwas in the cruise phase of flight or descending the\
  \ risk of it detaching and damaging control \nsurfaces around the rear of the aeroplane\
  \ was higher.    \n4.11.  Because of the safety actions taken by the operator ,\
  \ the Commission has made no \nrecommendations (see section 6 of this report). \
