  percentage: 40
  explanation: The incident involved "unchecked assumptions being made by the loader, first officer and captain about the actions or intended actions of others" (4.2).

- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While there is no direct mention of inadequate training, the failure to follow procedures such as the DDPG requirement for a crew member to check the security of the cargo door (4.2) suggests a potential lapse in training reinforcement or competency in adhering to safety-critical procedures.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
