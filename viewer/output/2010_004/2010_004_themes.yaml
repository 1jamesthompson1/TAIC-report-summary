- name: Adherence to Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to procedures is a safety theme that involves following established protocols and checklists to ensure the safety of operations. In the context of this accident, the failure to adhere to procedures was a significant factor. The first officer did not check the cargo door as required, which is a critical procedure for ensuring the door's security on a pressurized aircraft ("the first officer not checking that it was locked as he was required to do" (4.2)). Additionally, the crew did not follow the Defence Door Policy Guide (DDPG) requirement for a crew member to check the security of the cargo door, which was a defense against the door inadvertently not being closed properly ("The crew not following that requirement removed that defence" (4.2)). This theme is relevant because the established procedures are designed to prevent such incidents, and the failure to follow them directly contributed to the accident.
- name: Assumption of Actions by Others
  explanation: Assumption of actions by others is a safety theme where individuals rely on the expected actions of their colleagues without verification. This theme is relevant to the accident as the loader, first officer, and captain all made unchecked assumptions about the actions or intended actions of others regarding the closure and locking of the cargo door ("It also involved a number of unchecked assumptions being made by the loader, first officer and captain about the actions or intended actions of others" (4.2)). The first officer assumed the loader had closed and locked the door, which was a critical error ("the first officer to believe the loader had done so on this occasion" (4.3)). This theme highlights the importance of verifying critical safety actions rather than assuming they have been completed.
- name: Distraction During Critical Procedures
  explanation: Distraction during critical procedures is a safety theme that recognizes the impact of interruptions or distractions on the performance of essential safety tasks. In this accident, the first officer was distracted during the final walk-around inspection, which led to the omission of a critical check on the cargo door ("The removal of the nose wheel chocks was not normal and was a greater distraction for the first officer" (4.4)). The first officer's routine was interrupted, and he did not return to the point in the checklist where he was interrupted, nor did he start the routine again, as would be the correct procedure ("the person running the checklist should return to the point in the checklist where he or she was interrupted from task, or if that is unclear, start the routine again" (4.4)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates how distractions can lead to oversights that compromise safety.
- name: Visual Confirmation and Indicator Effectiveness
  explanation: Visual confirmation and indicator effectiveness is a safety theme that involves the use of visual checks and indicators to confirm the status of equipment or systems. In this incident, the faded paint on the visual lock indicator and the faulty cargo door sensor compromised the effectiveness of visual confirmation ("The faded paint on the visual lock indicator meant positive confirmation of the door being closed required a close-up check of the indicator" (4.3), "The faulty cargo door sensor effectively removed a source of warning to the crew that the cargo door might not be properly secured" (5.3)). The reliance on visual indicators without proper verification contributed to the accident, making this theme highly relevant.
- name: Training and Use of Safety Skills
  explanation: Training and use of safety skills is a safety theme that focuses on the application of learned safety practices and procedures in operations. The crew in this incident had been trained in "threat and error management" (TEM), but they did not apply these skills effectively to prevent the incident ("The use of these TEM skills by the crew could have prevented the incident" (4.8)). The crew failed to recognize the defective cargo door warning system as a "threat" and did not confirm that the necessary actions were taken to manage this threat ("if both pilots had recognised...that the defective cargo door warning system was a 'threat' to safety of flight, they almost certainly would have paid close attention to the ddpg requirement" (4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of not only having safety training but also applying it consistently to ensure safety.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  explanation: Organizational safety culture is a safety theme that pertains to the collective values, attitudes, and behaviors regarding safety within an organization. The report suggests that the operator's instructions and the established safety culture did not sufficiently emphasize the importance of individual responsibility for safety actions ("an operator's instruction that if the cargo door was closed it had to be locked and checked by the person closing it would have reduced the risk of the door being inadvertently left unlocked" (5.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). The lack of robust discussion between the pilots about the cargo door annunciator light also indicates a safety culture that did not promote critical questioning and verification ("The discussion between the 2 pilots was not robust enough to challenge the mindset" (4.7)). This theme is relevant as it highlights how organizational practices and culture can influence individual behaviors and safety outcomes.
