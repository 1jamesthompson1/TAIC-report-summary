  \ events are rare but potentially dangerous.  The cabin pressurisation \nsystem\
  \ operated normally on the flight from Auckland to Wellington.  On the return flight,\
  \ \nshortly after the descent to Auckland began, the cabin pressure began dec reasing\
  \ at a rate \nequivalent to a climb rate of up to 4,000 ft per minute .13 (A decrease\
  \ in the cabin pressure is \nusually  expressed as an  increase in the cabin altitude\
  \ .)  Pilots would normally detect such a \nrapid  decrease in cabin pressure  through\
  \  physiolo gical changes (for example, ear 'popping') .  \nHowever,  in this case\
  \ the cabin rate increase appears to have occurred just prior to  the cabin \naltitude\
  \ warning horn  sounding , which gave no time for the flight crew to take pre -emptive\
  \ \naction to control the pre ssure change . \n4.1.2.  In spite of extensive inspections\
  \ a nd a detailed examination of key components of the \npressurisation system,\
  \ no definite cause was found for the loss of cabin pressure.  The \nfollowing analysis\
  \ discusses  a number of technical  factors that might have contributed to  the\
  \ \ncabin depressurising . \n4.1.3.  This analysis  also discusses th e following\
  \ three safety issues that we re identi fied in the inquiry : \n\uF0B7 non-adherence\
  \ to the published emergency checklists for a loss of cabin \npressure  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the train ing of cabin crew in the use of  emergency oxygen equipment and the\
  \ \ncabin depressurisation procedure  \n\uF0B7 the possibility of the cabin being\
  \  pressurised on the ground following the use \nof the Cabin Altitude Warning checklist\
  \ . \n4.2. Factors that affect cabin pressure  \nTo pressurise the cabin, air is\
  \ supplied continuously from the engines via the air-conditioning \npacks.  The\
  \ pressure is regulated by controlling the exit of air from the aft outflow valve.\
  \  \nTherefore  the cabin pressure is affected by the following factors:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the inflow, or supply, of air  from the engines to the cabin  \n\uF0B7 the controlled\
  \ (regulated) leakage of air  from the cabin  \n\uF0B7 any uncontrolled leakage\
  \ of air  from the cabin . \n4.3. Defects that could cause a reduced air supply\
  \  \n4.3.1.  Key components  of the air -conditioning and pressurisation system\
  \ that are involved in the \nsupply of cabin air are:  \n\uF0B7 the engine bleed\
  \ valves  \n\uF0B7 the packs.  \n4.3.2.  If the high stage14 bleed valve does  not\
  \ open when the engine thrust is reduced to begin a \ndescent, there w ill be  low\
  \ air flow from t hat engine.  There have been  incidents where high \nstage bleed\
  \ valves have had intermittent , but unidentifiable,  defects .  However, neither\
  \ Boeing \nnor the operator was aware of  a high stage bleed valve defect having\
  \ caused  the cabin  altitude \nto increase at  a rate exce eding  2,000 ft per\
  \ minute . \n4.3.3.  The aeroplane had had various bleed air system defects in the\
  \ four months preceding this \noccurrence , including low bleed (or 'duct') pressure\
  \ from the engine s.  The most recent \noccurrence had been  a low  duct pressure\
  \ during a descent , which occurred six weeks before \nthis incident .  The high\
  \ -pressure ('high -stage ') bleed valves for both engines had been  replaced  \n\
  \                                                        \n13 The more correct unit\
  \ for the cabin rates recorded by the pressure controller is 'sea level feet per\
  \ minute' . \n14 The 'high stage' bleed valves are at a later stage of the compressor\
  \ section.  When they open, the higher -\npressure air maintains the required air\
  \ mass flow for air -conditioning pack operation.  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final\
  \ report AO -2013 -008 several  times .  Defects had occurred with other bleed air\
  \ system components, mainly those \nconnected with the left engine.   There had\
  \ been no  other recorded defect s in the six weeks  \nbefore this  incident . \n\
  4.3.4.  On the incident flight t he pilots followed the usual pr ocedure  of setting\
  \ both  packs to \nautomatic  mode .  If one pack is providing no flow  when the\
  \ packs are in automatic mode , the \nother automatically increase s its output\
  \ to high flow.  There was no indication of that \nhappen ing on this flight.  \n\
  4.3.5.  The engine bleed valves and the packs tested satisfactorily after the incident\
  \ . \n4.4. Defects that could cause an excessive air outflow  \nControlled air outflow\
  \  \n4.4.1.  The principal components invo lved with the controlled leak age or\
  \ outflow of cabin air are:  \n\uF0B7 the aft outflow valve  \n\uF0B7 the forward\
  \ outflow valve . \n4.4.2.  According to Boeing and the manufacturer of the outflow\
  \ valve, the minor defects found with \nthe valve were typical for its time in service\
  \ .  They would not have caused the cabin pressure  to \ndecrease  at the rate that\
  \ it did . \n4.4.3.  The pressurisation control syste m also signals the forward\
  \ outflow valve to close when the aft \noutflow valve is fully closed.  Because\
  \ the aft valve remained closed for the rest of the flight, \nthe forward valve\
  \ would also have stayed closed.  This was a normal response of the system \nand,\
  \ although it caused the 'Equipment cooling OFF' light to illuminate after landing\
  \ ( see \nparagraph 3.2.9 ), it did not require any corrective maintenance action.\
  \  \nUncon trolled leakage  \n4.4.4.  Uncontrolled leakage  can occur  at a number\
  \ of places:  through door seals, where wire bundles \nand controls penetrate bulkhead\
  \ s, from various drains, skin cracks and ruptures, and as a \nresult of a defect\
  \ in an air-conditioning  or pressurisation system component.  A malfunction of\
  \ \none of the aeroplane systems that was a minor user of bleed air would not ,\
  \ on its own , have \ncaused the substantial loss of cabin pressure that occurred.15\
  \ \n4.4.5.  An inspection of the aeroplane  prior to the ground test of the pressurisation\
  \ system found no \nevidence of a structural factor having contributed to the incident.\
  \  However, a worn cabin entry \ndoor seal was identified and replaced.  In the\
  \ leak-down tests the fuselage met the minimum \nrequirement for reta ining pressure.\
  \  \n4.4.6.  The fuselage was proven to be sufficiently air tight by remain ing\
  \ partially pressurise d following  \nthe emergency procedure until after the landing\
  \ . \nSafety relief valve s \n4.4.7.  Boeing confirmed that there had been cabin\
  \ depressurisation events caused  by safety relief \nvalve s activating unnecessarily\
  \ while in the cruise .  However,  Boeing said it was unlikely  that \nthe cabin\
  \ differential pressure16 in this case had  increased to 8.1 pounds per square inch\
  \ \n(psi), which was the lower pressure found during the 'crack ' testing of the\
  \ safety relief valves  \nfitted to this aeroplane (see paragraph 3.7.9 ).  This\
  \ conclusion  was partly confirm ed by the \npost-incident verification flight,\
  \ during which a climb was made to 37,000 ft with a flight \n                  \
  \                                      \n15 For example, the hydraulic and water\
  \ systems  use bleed air to pressurise the fluid reservoirs . \n16 Differential\
  \ pressure is the difference between the cabin air pressure and the outside air\
  \ pressure.  \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -008 \n<< Page 11 >>\n altitude of 36,000\
  \ ft set in the pressure controller (as for the incident flight).17  The differential\
  \ \npressure increased to only 7.9 psi compared with the normal cruise differential\
  \ of 7.8 psi.  \nPressure controller  \n4.4.8.  According to Boeing's description\
  \ of the pressurisation system, t he 'Auto fail ' annunciator on \nthe overhead\
  \ panel should illuminate if the pressure controller sense s a sustained cabin rate\
  \ \nof climb greater than 2,000 ft per minute.  That light  did not  illuminate\
  \ during this incident, \nand the pressure controller did not record th at it had\
  \ come on .  This  suggested that  the high \nclimb rate observed by the pilots\
  \  was of very short dur ation .  Both digital pressure controllers \ntested satisfactorily\
  \ after the incident , but both were replaced  as a precaution . \nSummary  \n4.4.9.\
  \  No individual component of the cabin pressurisation system was identified as\
  \ having cause d \nthe loss of cabin pressure.  The outflow valve, selector panel\
  \ and cabin pressure controller all \nhave internal , built-in test functions that\
  \ report any faults affecting the control of cabin \npressure, whether intermittent\
  \ or constant18, to the controller , which records these faults to \nnon-volatile\
  \ memory.  The non-volatile memory  data for this incident  was examined and no\
  \ \npressuri sation system failures were recorded.  The tear -down examination of\
  \ those \ncomponents revealed no faults.  Experience has shown t hat older pressurisation\
  \ system \ncomponents can have intermittent  faults that do not show during subsequent\
  \ testing .  A \ncombination of components with low or marginal perform ance could\
  \ have  caused the incident , \nbut no such combination was identified.   Boein\
  \ g submitted that the cabin pressure continuing \nto decrease when the outflow\
  \ valve was closed indicated a root cause that was related to \ninsufficient cabin\
  \ air inflow or excessive fuselage leakage.  \nFinding s \n1. The cause of the loss\
  \ of cabin pressure was not determined.  \n2. An intermittent defect within the\
  \ air -conditioning and  pressurisation system \ncould not  be excluded as the cause\
  \  of the loss of cabin pressure . \n \n4.5. Response to the emergency  \nFlight\
  \ crew actions  \n4.5.1.  Pilots and cabin crew must memorise and frequently practise\
  \ emergency procedures so that \nthey react promptly and correctly.  In particular,\
  \ crew members must not delay putting on \noxygen mask s as soon as  there is a\
  \ clear indication of a loss of cabin pressure.  \n4.5.2.  The pilot in command\
  \ may take whatever action is necessary under the circumstances to \nensure the\
  \ safety  of everyone  on board .  That authority extends to vary ing an emergency\
  \ \nchecklist if conditions require it.  However, an unnecessary deviation from\
  \ the publi shed \nemergency p rocedures is a safety issue if it is done without\
  \ knowing why the step was in the \nchecklist or the potential consequences  of\
  \ the variation . \n4.5.3.  A loss of cabin pressure  is one of the few in -flight\
  \ conditions that require an immediate, \nmemorised  response by pilots.  The usual\
  \ training for this event is a simulated rapid \ndecompression while at cruise altitude.\
  \  Pilots frequently practise this exercise so the \nmemorised actions counter the\
  \ surprise and workload of an actual emergency, which  could \notherwise lead to\
  \  their  making  error s.  However, this incident differed  from the practised\
  \ \nscenario because the loss of cabin pressure occurred when the aeroplane was\
  \  already in a \nnormal descent.  It was conceivable t hat the differen t circumstances\
  \  interfe red with the pilots' \nrecall and performance of the memorised actions.\
  \  \n                                                        \n17 The conclusion\
  \  was not fully  confirmed  because other component s had been  change d after\
  \ the incident and  the \ncabin pressure on the verification flight might not  have\
  \ been exactly the same as it had been  on the incident flight.  \n18 A constant\
  \ or steady fault condition is sometimes said to be 'latched' . \n \n\n<< Page 12\
  \ >>\n Final report AO -2013 -008 4.5.4.  Both pilots fitted their oxygen masks\
  \ immediately after they recognised the loss of cabin \npressure . However,  their\
  \  actions varied from the published procedures in the following areas:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ no cabin announcement was made to warn the cabin crew of the emergency descent\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the flight deck 'passenger oxygen ' switch was not selected on  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the subsequent checklist  reviews  were no t conducted out loud.  \n4.5.5.  The\
  \ pilot flying said that he did not warn the cabin  crew of the more rapid descent\
  \  because the \naeroplane was already descen ding and he had heard the automatic\
  \ passenger announcement \nto fit oxygen masks.  He concluded that the cabin crew\
  \ would have realise d it was a real \nemergency.  Although t he operator concu\
  \ rred with that reasoning , the cabin crew would have \nhad no doubt if the pilot\
  \ had made the required announcement . \n4.5.6.  The pilot monitoring said he did\
  \ not turn on the passenger oxygen switch because the light \nassociated with the\
  \ switch was already illuminated and the automatic  passenger \nannouncement was\
  \ playing, both of which indicated that the masks had deployed.  However, \nthere\
  \ is some risk involved when pilots make their own decision s as to the necessity\
  \ of  a step \nin an  emergency checklist.  Oxygen is not generated until a deployed\
  \ mask is pulled down, so \nnot selecting the flight deck switch did not prevent\
  \ the supply of oxygen .  However, Boeing \nadvised that the flight deck switch\
  \ is a back -up to the cabin pressure switch that signals the \nmasks to deplo y,\
  \ and it should therefore be selected on.  The operator passed that advice to \n\
  its pilots.  \n4.5.7.  When reviewing the emergency checklists, the pilot monitoring\
  \ did not read the steps out aloud \nas the operator's procedures required, although\
  \ the pilot flying was a ware the review was \ntaking place.  A different crew made\
  \ the same omission during a simulator review of the \nincident conducted for the\
  \ investigation.  The verbal review of a checklist is an important part \nof the\
  \ emergency procedure s because it is a cross -check that the correct  actions have\
  \ been \nperformed completely . It gives pilots a shared understanding of the situation\
  \ and any factors to \nbe considered for the rest of the fligh t. \n4.5.8.  In this\
  \ case the deviations were of a minor nature and did not affect the saf e outcome\
  \ . \nNevertheless,  the operator has, during annual training programmes for pilots,\
  \ emphasis ed the \nimportance of adhering to published checklists.  \n4.5.9.  One\
  \ of the pre -flight tasks of the pilot sitting in the right seat was to set t he\
  \ planned cruise \naltitud e in the pressure control panel.  In this case the pilots\
  \ left the selected altitude for the \nflight to Auckland at 36,000 ft, which  it\
  \ had been  on the flight to Wellington, and did not reset \nit to 37,000 ft.  The\
  \ right -seat pilot, who usually flew as a captain from the left seat,  had met\
  \  \nthe operator's minimum requirements for recent flying in the aeroplane from\
  \  the right seat.  \nThe minor error in setting the cruise altitude  could have\
  \ been made by a ny pilot who regularly \nsat in the right seat.  However,  the\
  \ operator's investigation into the incident noted that the \nerror might \"indicate\
  \ a need for a more formalised currency program for pilots with \nmanagement and\
  \ administrative responsibilities \".19 \n4.5.10.  One of the pilots made a radio\
  \ call to air traffic control to advise of the emergency descent . He \ndid not\
  \ begin the message with the words , 'PAN, PAN, PAN', which are internationally\
  \ \nrecognised to mean an aircraft faces an urgent situation .  The Commission and\
  \ other agencies \nhave previously noted the omission of  the recognised words by\
  \ pilots making radio call s to \nadvis e of situation s of urgency (or distress\
  \ ).20  In an earlier effort t o improve pilot compliance  \nwith this requirement\
  \  the CAA had included education on urgency and distress calls in one of \nits\
  \ annual pilot education  programmes .21  The operator used this incident  in its\
  \  2014  recurrent \n                                                        \n\

  \ inquir ies 06-009 (Boeing 767, ZK-NCK, engine fire, Auckland International Airport,\
  \ 30 \nDecember 2006 ) and 10 -003 (Cessna C208 Caravan ZK -TZR, engine fuel leak\
  \ and forced landing, Nelson, 10 \nFebruary 2010) . \n21 This programme , called\
  \ 'Plane Talking ', was the basis of the 2012  AvKiwi  annual  education series.\
  \  \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -008 \n<< Page 13 >>\n training programme for pilots\
  \ as an example  of the importance of using urgency and distress \ncalls when appropriate.\
  \  \n4.5.11.  In view of the improvements made by the operator to pilo t training,\
  \ the Commission made no \nrecommendation regarding any of the above issues . \n\
  Finding  \n3. The pilots did not follow exactly the emergency checklist  action\
  \ s, which \nincreased the risk of  an action being omitted  or a required sequence\
  \ of \nactions  being altered . \n \nResponse in the cabin  \n4.5.12.  The c rew\
  \ members of any pressurised aircraft must be acutely aware of the hazard of a loss\
  \ of \ncabin  pressure .  The  'time of useful consciousness ' remaining after pressurisation\
  \ is lost or the \noxygen supply is interrupted  illustrates  the seriousness of\
  \ the hazard  (see Appendix 3).  The \ntime available cannot be predicted accurately\
  \ because it depend s on the nature of the event \nand an individual's physiology\
  \ and level of exertion at the time.  If a rapid depressurisation \noccurred a t\
  \ 25,000 ft , the time of useful consciousness could be as little as 90 seconds\
  \ .  \nHowever, cognitive performance c ould be impaired more quickly, in which\
  \ case the affected \nperson might be unable to recall or take the required actions\
  \ .  Therefore  it is imperative that a \nmask be fitted as soon as possible  and\
  \ remain fitted until the wearer is instructed that it may \nbe removed . \n4.5.13.\
  \  An incident i n the United States  in which  a Boeing 737 lost cabin pressure\
  \ as a result of a \nstructural failure  provides an ex ample of  the hazard . \
  \ One of the flight attendant s, who thought \nhe could get a lot more done before\
  \ having to put on a mask, lost consciousness and fell, \nsuffering a fractured\
  \ nose.22  A passenger who was also not wearing a  mask  tried to help the \nattendant\
  \  and also lost consciousness.  Both regained consciousness during the descen t.\
  \ \n4.5.14.  On the incident flight to Auckland  there was no prior indication ,\
  \ such as a perceptible cabin air \npressure change  or an announcement by a pilot\
  \ , that the o xygen masks might  deploy . \nNevertheless , all passengers followed\
  \ t he standard instructions for fitting mask s that are given  \nbefore every flight.\
  \   However, two cabin crew members delayed fitting mask s.  A delay in fitting\
  \ \na mask might lead to cognitive impairment  that could endanger the individual\
  \ and  others . \n4.5.15.  The senior flight attendant, FA1, did not know  why she\
  \ had not sat down  in the nearest \navailable seat and fit ted a mask , as the\
  \ crew had been  told to do .  A possible reason was that \nthe limited range of\
  \  training scenarios had not required her to actually sit  down in a passenger\
  \ \nseat if necessary .  She said that th e green flow indicator was visible  in\
  \ the oxygen tubing  and \nshe had not felt any lightheadedness . \n4.5.16.  Later\
  \ i nspection showed that the oxygen generator at that position  had not been activated.\
  \   \nTherefore FA1 had not been supplied  with oxygen .  It was highly likely that\
  \ she saw only the \nedge of the flow indicator , which may be slightly visible\
  \ even when there is no flow (see Figure \n4).  The opera tor's training for cabin\
  \ crew had not demonstrated how the indicator becomes \nfully visible when oxygen\
  \ is flowing .  The operator has since revised its cabin crew training to \ndescribe\
  \ and demonstrate the oxygen system more accurately . \n                       \
  \                                 \n22 NTSB report DCA11MA039, Southwest Airlines,\
  \ Flight 812, Boeing 737 -3H4, N632SW, Yuma Arizona, 1 April \n2011.  \n \n\n<<\
  \ Page 14 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -008  \nFigure 4 \nOxygen tubing, showing no\
  \ flow (left) and full flow (right)  \n(Picture from the operator)  \n4.5.17.  Tests\
  \ by the operator showed that improper packing of the oxygen mask was the likely\
  \ reason \nfor the generator at the front left door, where F A1 stood , failing\
  \ to activate.  Another test on a \ndifferent Boeing 737 found some improperly packed\
  \ passenger oxygen masks.  Even though \neach row of seats had a spare mask, the\
  \ improper packing or maintenance of equipment that \nis critical to life support\
  \ i s a potential safety issue  on all aeroplane types.   The operator \nreviewed\
  \ the quality control of the maintenance of oxygen units across its fleets and deemed\
  \ \nno further action was necessary.  Therefore  the Commission made no recommendation\
  \ on this \nmatter.23 \n4.5.18.  When the cabin oxygen masks deployed  FA2 continued\
  \ to push the cart 'uphill ' to the rear \ngalley .  One possible reason for her\
  \ doing this was the sub conscious  association of the crew \nstation with safety\
  \ , because the cabin crew training demonstrations tende d to occur at the \ncrew\
  \ stations rather than in the cabin aisles .  This extra  effort would have required\
  \ additional \noxygen and delayed her putting on a mask .  The correct action would\
  \ have been to apply the \ncart brakes , fit the nearest spare mask  and, if possible,\
  \ take a seat  and remain seated .  Four \nmasks are available for each set of three\
  \ passenger seats.  \n4.5.19.  After the incident both of the rear galley oxygen\
  \  units were found to have been activated.  FA3 , \nwho was already in the rear\
  \ galley, fitted a  mask from the unit at the right rear door and  had no \nconcern\
  \ for the  oxygen flow.  Therefore  FA2 might have been mistaken  (like FA1) in\
  \ thinking \nshe was not getting oxygen .  Both flight attendants received oxygen\
  \ from the unit at the left \nrear door.  \nCrew training and procedures  \n4.5.20.\
  \  Crew members must be completely familiar with the emergency equipment  installed\
  \  for the \npassengers' and their own safety.  FA1's incorrect interpretation of\
  \ the oxygen mask flow \nindicator and FA2's delay in putting on  a mask  suggested\
  \ some  unfamiliarity with the \nequipment and the actions to be taken  for a pressurisation\
  \ incident , which  indicat ed a need to \nimprove  the cabin crew training  programme\
  \ and resources . \n4.5.21.  The operator submitted that depressurisation and the\
  \ associated pr ocedures and equipment \nwere  covered in detail during initial\
  \ and recurrent training for crews.  The training involve d \nlectures, videos and\
  \ practical exercises.  However, the operator also submitted that the \nobserved\
  \ cabin crew procedural non -conformances m ight have been due to the artificiality\
  \ of \nthe training scenarios .  To reduce the potential for lapses like those seen\
  \ in this incident, the \noperator instituted monthly crew briefing questions and\
  \ assessment s of individual competency \nin the depressurisatio n drills during\
  \ the annual line checks . \n4.5.22.  In view of the improvements made by the operator\
  \ to cabin crew training, the Commission \nmade no recommendation regarding any\
  \ of the above issues . \n                                                     \
  \   \n23 Air New Zealand subsequently disposed of its Boeing 737 fleet in 2014 .\
  \ \n\n \nFinal report AO -2013 -008 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.5.23.  The cabin crew responded\
  \ appropriately to the toilet smoke alarms by t reating them as \ngenuine alarms.\
  \  They were unable to silence the alarms in the normal way.  Cabin crew are \n\
  informed during their training that false smoke alarms can occur , but it was not\
  \ generally \nknown that a spike in the cabin pressure could cause a fal se alarm\
  \ . \nFinding  \n4. The actions  of some of the cabin crew during the incident \
  \ showed that their \nemergency training had not sufficiently stressed the importance\
  \ of sitting \ndown and fitting a mask without delay, and had not allowed for a\
  \ range of \nscenarios  or adequately familiarised the crew with the oxygen equipment.\
  \  \n4.6. Cabin Altitude Warning  checklist  \n4.6.1.  Normally, when the pressurisation\
  \ system is in automatic mode, the outflow valve opens upon \nlanding to depressurise\
  \ the cabin  fully.  After pilots have carrie d out the Cabin Altitude Warning \
  \ \nchecklist  the pressur isation system will be in the manual  mode .  Unless\
  \ the pilots open  the \noutflow valve  while  in manual mode, the valve will remain\
  \  closed  on landing . \n4.6.2.  The Boeing manuals did not explain that th e system\
  \ configuration after performing the Cabin \nAltitude Warning checklist could  allow\
  \ the cabin to r e-pressuris e.  The cabin doors were 'plug' -\ntype doors that\
  \ move d inwards slightly before opening outwards.  If there is any significant\
  \ \ncabin pressure, a door cannot be physically opened.  Therefore if the cabin\
  \ is not fully \ndepressurised on the ground , the doors will be difficult or impossible\
  \ to open , and this would \nhinder an emergency evacuation if that were needed\
  \ .24  In this case the aeroplane was slightly \npressurised after landing  and\
  \ the crew were  initially unable  to open the cabin door after the \nengine shutdown.\
  \  \n4.6.3.  The operator said that the re-pressurisation scenar io had not been\
  \ anticipated before this \nincident, and therefore its Boeing 737 pilots had not\
  \ been trained for it.  The Cabin Altitude \nWarning checklist did not require pilots\
  \ to ensure that the aeroplane was depressurised before \nlanding.   In contrast,\
  \ the  checklist for a nother  condition  for which manual mode is selected , \n\
  'Unscheduled Pressuri zation Change ', had a 'Deferred Item' that called for the\
  \ aft outflow \nvalve  to be opened manually  before landing.25 \n4.6.4.  Boeing\
  \ later advised that it had added the Deferred Items of the 'Unscheduled  Pressurization\
  \ \nChange ' checklist to the C abin Altitude  Warning  checklist, to direct pilots\
  \ control ling the \naeroplane  pressure manually to open the outflow valve upon\
  \ landing .  For this reason the \nCommission did not make a recommendation regarding\
  \ the checklist content.  \n \n  \n                                            \
  \            \n24 For this reason the Ground Evacuation  checklist requ ires pilots\
  \ to open the aft outflow valve fully  manually \nbefore giving the 'Evacuate '\
