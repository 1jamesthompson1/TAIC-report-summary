The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor  the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) crimina l, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents  and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 30 August 2013 a Boeing 737 -300 aeroplane  operated by Air New Zealand  was on a 
scheduled service between Wellington and Auckland.  After the aeroplane began its descent to 
Auckland, it lost  cabin pressur e.  The pilots commenced  the relevant  emergency procedure s 
and made a  normal landing at Auckland  Airport .  No-one was injured and the aeroplane was 
not damaged.  
1.2. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( Commission ) was unable to identi fy the 
cause of the depressurisation despite e xtensive testing  and a specialist examination of the 
pressurisation system .  An intermittent defect within the air -conditioning and  pressurisation 
system could  not be excluded as the cause.  
1.3. The Commission made findings  relating to the following safety issues : 
 non-adhere nce to the published emergency checklists  for a loss of cabin 
pressure  
 the training of cabin crew in the use of  the emergency oxygen equipment  and 
the cabin depressurisation procedure . 
1.4. The operator acted  to correct these issues.  Therefore the Commission made no 
recommendations  regarding them.  
1.5. In addition, the inquiry considered the potential for t he cabin to be  pressurised on the ground 
following the use of the  Cabin Altitude Warning  checklist .  Boeing subsequently amended the 
checklist  to reduce th at risk .  
1.6. The key lesson s identified from the  inquiry into this occurrence were as follows : 
 an unexpected loss of cabin pressure in any aeroplane is a serious event that 
can cause both passengers and crew  to lose consciousness  rapidly  from a 
lack of oxygen.  In such an event  the appropriate  emergency  actions must be 
undertaken  immediately.  Where oxygen masks are fitted, passengers and  
cabin crew must  put on their masks and await further instruction from the 
flight crew  
 the purpose of emergency procedure checklists is to ensure that crew 
members do not miss an important action at a critical  time of high workload.   
Therefore, unless the captain has an exceptional  reason to deviate from  a 
checklist, it should be performed from beginning to end, if possible  without 
interruption, and without omitting any step  
 crew members must be thoroughly trained in and familiar with all emergency 
equipmen t and procedures, because  the equipment and procedures are for 
their own protection as well as that of the passengers.  They need to be alert 
for emergency situations that differ from the standard scen arios that are 
practised  and demonstrated repeatedly  
 an aircraft door will be very difficult to open on the ground while the cabin is 
still pressurised , and this can delay an evacuation if it is called for .  When 
pilots have been controlling the cabin pressure manually, they must ensure 
that the cabin is fully depressurised to allow the doors to be opened  
 special care must be taken with the maintenance of  aircraft emergency 
equipment,  such as oxygen systems.

 Final report AO -2013 -008 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Shortly after the aeroplane landed at Auckland , Air New Zealand  Limited  (the operator) 
notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( Commission ) directly of th e 
incident.  The operator promptly quarantined the aeroplane and its flight recorders.  The 
Commission opened an inquiry and notified the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) . 
2.2. In accordance with the protocols of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, 
the Commission notified the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States, 
being the state of the aeroplane manufacturer.   The NTSB took part in most communication s 
between the Commission, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Limi ted (Boeing ) and the makers of 
key pressurisation system components.  
2.3. Two Commission investigators travelled to Auckland on 30 August 2013 to begin the  
investigation .  They were present for the initial fault -finding  conducted by the operator , and 
consulted an investigator from  the CAA about potential airworthiness issues . 
2.4. The pilots and two of the cabin crew were interviewed on 31 August 2013, and th e third cabin 
crew member was intervi ewed on 9 September 2013.  Passengers for whom contact details 
were avail able were sent a questionnaire on their perspective s of the incident.  
2.5. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau appointed an Accredited Representative and 
successfully download ed the cockpit voice recorder at the Bureau's  laboratory in Canberra on 
5 September  2013.  
2.6. On 22 October 2013 Commission investigators observed a Boeing 737 flight simulator detail 
in which the cabin altitude2 warning and emergency descent checklists were demonstrated.  
2.7. The c ompletion of the inquiry report  was delayed by higher -priority investigations .  In addition , 
it was apparent early in the investigation that the cause was unlikely to  be determined.  
2.8. On 27 April 2016  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to interested persons 
for comment.  
2.9. Submission s were received from t he operator, some of the crew and the aircraft 
manufacturer.  The Commission has considered all submissions and any changes as a result 
of those submissions  have been included in this final report.  
2.10.  On 28 July 2016  the Commission approved the report for pub lication.  
  
                                                        
2 Cabin altitude is the pressure of the air inside an aircraft cabin expressed as the altitude in the atmosphere at 
which the same pressure would be found.  'Altitude' is the height above mean sea level.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Introduction - the need for cabin pressurisation and emergency  oxygen  
3.1.1.  Turbine -powered a eroplanes generally fly at high altitude s because the ir performance is more 
efficient in the less dense air.  As altitude increases the atmospheric pressure decreases .  
However, a bove about  10,000 feet (ft) (3 ,000 metres)3, the lower atmospheric pressure is 
detrimental to people because  their lungs do not absorb sufficient  oxygen .  As the oxygen 
content of blood decreases, one's ability to think and act efficiently becomes impaired .  In 
sever e cases unconsciousness and death can occur.  
3.1.2.  This problem is avoided for aeroplane passengers by pressurising the aeroplane, using the 
conditioned  air that is pumped into the cabin.  Aeroplanes that fly  above 10,000 ft will usually 
be pressurised .  The cabin air is normally maintained at a pressure that is equivalent to that 
found between 5,000 and 8,000  ft in the atmosphere . Therefore, w hen the cab in is 
pressurised, the 'cabin altitude ' is lower than the 'flight  altitude ' (see Figure 1 ). 
 
Figure 1 
Cabin altitude compared with flight altitude  (illustrative only)  
3.1.3.  Civil avia tion rules, in general, require  pressurised aeroplanes to have emergency  oxyge n 
available in case cabin  pressur e is lost at high altitude.   Typically , the emergency  oxygen is 
supplied automatically from units above the seats (and in the toilets)  before  the cabin 
pressure decreases to a n unsafe  level.  The pilots have a s eparate oxygen supply , but the 
supply for pilots and passengers is limited.  Therefore, in the event of a loss of cabin pressure, 
the aeroplane must descend quickly to an altitude where there is adequate  oxygen . 
3.1.4.  A loss of  cabin pressure is a rare  event, but if mishandled  it can cause injury or death.  Prompt 
and correct action on the part of the pilots may mean that control of the cabin pressure  is 
regained  and the need for an emergency descent  averted .  However, i f oxygen  masks appear  
in the cabin  everyone must fit  their  mask immediately  and keep it on until instructed 
otherwise.  
3.2. The incident  
3.2.1.  On Friday 30 August 2013 a Boeing 737 -300,  registered ZK -NGI, operated a sch eduled return 
flight between Auckland and Wellington.  T he crew comprised  two pilots , both of captain rank, 
and three cabin crew .  For the flight  back to Auckland  the pilot in command was in the left 
                                                        
3 Imperial units are still used for vertical distances in most civil aviation jurisdictions.

 Final report AO -2013 -008 seat performing 'pilot monitoring ' duties , and the pilot in the right seat  was the 'pilot flying '.4  
The aeroplane departed Wellington with 76 passengers  and climbed to a cruise  altitude of 
37,000 f t5, where it remained for approximately nine and a half minutes.  
3.2.2.  When the aeroplane was passing approximately 30,000 ft on the descent to Auckland, the 
cabin altitude warning horn sounded  and t he 'cabin altitude ' annunciator6 illuminated . The 
warnings meant that the  cabin pressure was too low ( above 10,000 ft  equivalent altitude) .  An 
indicator on t he pressurisation system control panel on the flight deck overh ead panel showed  
that the  cabin pressure was decreasing  quickly .  The pilots confirmed that the  air-conditioning  
and pressurisation systems were set correctly , and saw that n o pressurisation system fault 
lights were illuminated . 
3.2.3.  The pilot s put on  their oxygen masks , initiated the emergency descent  procedure , and advis ed 
air traffic control .  At about this time  the senior flight attendant (designated 'FA1' by the 
operator ) called the flight deck on  the intercom .  She advise d that the passenger oxygen 
masks had deployed and check ed that the pilots had put their masks on.   When the cabin 
loses pressure and the cabin altitude exceeds the equivalent of 14,000 ft, passenger masks 
deploy automatically and a pre -recorded message plays over the public a ddress system, telling 
passengers to put on the nearest mask s.  The pilot flying confirmed with FA1 that the cabin 
pressure  had been  lost. 
3.2.4.  The pilots commenced  the emergency actions  for a loss of cabin pressure and an emergency 
descent  (see Appendix 2 for the emergency checklists) .  The pilot monitoring then silent ly 
check ed that all of  the required actions had been completed correctly.  
3.2.5.  One of the listed actions  was to select the passenger oxygen switch to on .7  The pilot 
monitoring did not do that because the associated annunciator was illuminated , indicating 
that the passenger masks had already deployed . 
3.2.6.  The cabin crew were preparing the cabin for landing when the masks deployed.  FA1 was at 
about mid -cabin, moving forward ; one attendant (FA3) was in the r ear galley ; and the third 
(FA2)  was pushing a cart to the rear galley  (see Figure 2).  FA1 continued walking  to her 
normal crew station at the front left entry door and fitted a mask.  She said the green flow 
indicator was visible but the attached reservoi r bag was not inflat ing.  She was later uncertain 
whether  oxygen had been  flowing .  FA1 remained standing by he r seat , observing the cabin,  
until the pilots announced  that masks could be removed.

4 The 'pilot flying ' is the pilot actually manipulating the controls; the 'pilot monitoring' is the support pilot who , 
among other duties,  makes th e radio calls.  Typically , pilots alternate the se roles  after each flight leg . 
5 The aviation industry refers to a cruise altitude of 37,000 ft as ' flight level  370', but for the benefit of the general 
reader the report expresses the altitudes in feet.  
6 An annunciator is a captioned light on an instrument panel that provides information on the state of a system . 
7 The switch was a back -up to the cabin pressure switch that automatically deployed the masks, and its position 
did not affect the supply of oxyge n to the masks (see paragraph 4.5.6). 

 
Final report AO -2013 -008 
<< Page 5 >>
 3.2.7.  FA3 first saw  that th e masks a bove  the right rear door  crew seat had deploy ed, but not those 
above the left rear crew seat.  When she saw that the masks had also deployed in the cabin , 
she fitted a mask .  FA2 pushed the cart to the galley, where FA3 helped her to stow  it.  FA2 
donned a mask but was unsure whether  oxygen was flowing to it.  She observed that  the 
reservoir  bag was not  inflating  like th e bag  on FA3's mask .  FA2 then manually deployed th e 
masks at the left rear door, fitted one and sat down next to  FA3. 
3.2.8.  It took approximately four minutes for th e aeroplane to descend  from 30,000 ft to below 
10,000 ft , at which point  the flight deck cabin altitude warning ceased.  The pilots continued 
the descent  to 5,000 ft  and maintained  that altitude .  Some of th e cabin crew and passengers 
said the cabin seemed hot , and many noticed a chemical smell.  The right rear  toilet  smoke 
alarm sounded , and l ater the smoke alarm for the forward toilet  sounded .  The crew took the 
appropriate action in response  to the se alarms , which  continued for the rest of the flight .8 
3.2.9.  While the aeroplane was taxiing to the terminal af ter landing, the 'equipment cooling OFF' light 
illuminated  on the flight deck .  The pilots switc hed to the alternate cooling source, the only 
action required, but the ann unciator remained illuminated.  
3.2.10.  At the terminal  FA1 was unable to open the forward entry door  because  the cabin was still 
slightly  pressurised .  The pilot s depressurise d the aeroplane  manually  and the doors were 
then opened to disembark the passengers . 
3.2.11.  The incident occurred in daylight.  Some passengers reported ear or sinus discomfort, which 
for a few persisted for several  days .  Otherwise t here we re no injuries . 
3.3. Personnel information  
3.3.1.  The pilot flying had more than  10,800 hours' flight experience, including 3,500 hours on the 
Boeing 737.  He was employed in a fleet management role and had been on office or 
simulator training duties for most of the six days  prior to the incident .  His most recent  day 
rostered free of duty had been  26 August 2015 .  On most days he had worked for 10 or 11 
hours .  He said h e had been  fit to fly on 30 August 2013.  
3.3.2.  The pilot monitoring had more than  12,000 hours' flight experience, including 5 ,200 hours on 
the Boeing 737.  He  had returned from annual leave four days before the incident, had 
worked for two days , and then had had a rostered day off.   He said that he had been  fit to fly  
on 30 August 2013 . 
3.3.3.  The senior flight attendant, FA1, had been  employed by t he operator as a flight attendant in 
1999 and promoted to purser in 2005.  The other two flight attendants had a combined 22 
years of flight attendant experience.  They all considered themselves familiar with the Boeing 
737 and said they had been  fit to fly that day . 
3.4. Aircraft information  
3.4.1.  The Boeing 737 -300 is a short - to medium -range, narrow -body ae roplane powered by two 
turbofan engines.  It is a variant of the Boeing 737  family that has been in production since  
1967 .  The normal crew is two pilots and t hree or four cabin crew .  Depending on the cabin 
configuration , up to 150 pass engers can be carried.  
3.4.2.  ZK-NGI had been  registered in New Zealand on 20 November 1999.   Air New Zealand retired 
its Boeing 737 fleet in September 2015 , but another New Zealand ope rator continued to use 
the aeroplane type after that date . 
3.5. Boeing 737 -300 pressurisation  
3.5.1.  The Boeing 737 -300 air -conditioning and pressurisation system s are typical for a turbine -
powered  aeroplane  (see Figure 3 ).  The cabin air is supplied by 'bleed air '9 taken from the 
                                                        
8 The airport fire service inspected the aeroplane as soon as the engines were shut down  and found no sign of fire.  
9 Bleed air is air tapped off one or more compressor stages of a turbine engine and used to supply some other 
system s.

 Final report AO -2013 -008 engines.  The air-conditioning system ( 'packs ') cool s the very hot b leed air , then distribute s it 
at the desired temperature to the cabin .  The continuous inflow of conditioned air pressurises 
the cabin , with excess  air being vented back to the atmosphere  through the aft outflow valve . 
3.5.2.  Under normal circumstances one of two identical  digital  pressure controller s regulate s the 
cabin pressure. The controllers  maintain the required pressure by adjusting  the aft outflow 
valve.  Unintended changes to the cabin pressur e can be caused by low air inflow  from the 
engines or air-conditioning  system , excessive leakage  or a defect in the control system .  The 
pressure controllers detect internal and external failures that affect the control of cabin 
pressure and, if appropriate, annunciate them on a flight deck panel regardless of whether the  
faults are  intermittent or not. 
3.5.3.  See Appendix 1 for more information on the Boei ng 737 -300 cabin pressurisation system.

3.6. Flight recorders  
3.6.1.  The aeroplane was fitted with a cockpit voice recorder  with 30 minutes ' recording duration.  
No useful information about the incident was obtained from the recorder because electrical 
power was n ot removed soon enough after the engine shutdown to prevent the incident being 
over-written.   The operator later reminded  its pilots  that power must be  remov ed from the 
recorders after landing  following a ser ious incident .10 
3.6.2.  The aeroplane was fitted with a digital flight data recorder.  However, unlike recorders on more 
modern aeroplanes the recorder d id not, and was not required to, record potentially useful 
parameters such as actual bleed air duct pressures a nd the outflow valve position . 
3.6.3.  A quick -access recorder was also fitted and that provided some data  about the flight path . 
 
                                                        
10 The operator's other jet aeroplanes were fitted with cockpit voice recorders with two -hour recording durations .

 3.7. Post-incident  testing  
3.7.1.  Post-incident testing  examined : 
 the cabin pressure controllers  
 whether there was a structural breach that would have allow ed air to escape  
 the outflow valve  
 the safety relief valves . 
3.7.2.  The operator's engineering staff, in the presence of Commission investigators, followed the 
fault -finding procedures (often called 'troubleshooting ') given in Boeing Service Letter 737 -SIL-
21-069 Airplane Pressurization - Guidance to Understanding.11   
Initial inspection  
3.7.3.  Both digital pressure controllers were tested with satisfactory results before the aeroplane 
was towed from the terminal to a hanga r and placed under quarantine.  The manufacturer of 
the controllers later tested them and downloaded their memory chips.  These showed that 
there had been an 'inflow/leakage fail ' status message just over a minute  prior to the cabin 
altitude aural warning . That status  meant the re was  a low inflow of air or excessive air 
leakage, or possibly  both conditions.  
3.7.4.  The aeroplane was inspected visually  for any sign of structural da mage or mechanical defect, 
and th e condition of controls a nd oxygen masks in the flight deck and cabin was recorded 
before electrical power was applied to the aeroplane to allow  further checks.  
Test for structural breach  
3.7.5.  To test for a breach in the fuselage t he cabin was pressurised on the ground using air f rom t he 
aeroplane's auxiliary power unit.  When th e air supply was stopped  the rate of pressure 'leak-
down ' was noted.  The recorded leak rate was within limits but  close to the maximum allow ed.  
The operator's engineers considered t hat the tes t eliminated the likelihood of a major 
structural breach in any fuselage area s that w ere difficult to access for inspect ion, such as 
under the tail fin.  
Outflow valve tests 
3.7.6.  The memory chips of the digital pressure controllers recorded th at th e outflow valv e had 
closed  appropriately when  signalled to do so by the controllers in response to the loss of 
pressure.  As a precaution the outflow valve was replaced and tested by its manufacturer .  The 
valve  had minor failures of  some incoming  test specifications , but the manufacturer said the 
discrepancies , of which one related to the outflow valve position feedback to the pressure 
controller , would not have caused the leakage condition recorded by the pressure controllers.  
Safety relief valve tests  
3.7.7.  The aeroplane h as two cabin pressure safety relief valves , which  open in the event of 
excessive cabin pressure .  They  remain open until the pressure is relieved, then  close.  
Whether a safety relief valve has ope ned can be inferred only from data stored in the digital 
pressure controller memory.  There was no evidence that that had happened . 
3.7.8.  One of the se valves had been in place since the aeroplane was manufactured in 1999, 
although it had been subject ed to routine maintenance checks.  The other valve had been  
installed i n 2012 following  overhaul by the vendor.  
                                                        
11 Issued on 22 May 2006.  
 

<< Page 8 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -008 3.7.9.  After the incident the operator removed and tested b oth valves .  Neither valve met the 
functional test requirements  for 'cracking ' pressure,  which is the pressure when the valve 
begins to open , nor the stabilised flow rate after  the valve had opened . 
3.7.10.  The manufacturer, UTC Aerospace Systems in the United States , inspected the valves and 
confirmed t he operator's results .  The manufacturer considered  that the results, and  some  
observed minor defects , were typical for the time the valves had been in service .  The 
manufacturer advised that such defects were not known to have  caused any in -flight incidents 
and would not have inhibited the correct operation  of the valves .  Boeing's analysis concluded 
that t he defects with the cabin pressure relief safety valves would not have caused a cabin 
depressurisation.  
Further testing  
3.7.11.  After the initial fault -finding , the operator's engineering staff performed another fuselage 'leak-
down ' test with a better result  than the first  test.  Before the aeroplane was returned to 
service it completed a satisfactory verification flight . 
3.7.12.  Boeing advised that the type of smoke detector fitted was sensitive to cabin pressure spikes 
that could cause a n alarm  to activate .12  Howev er, neither Boeing nor the oxygen generator 
manufacturer (B/E Aerospace of the United States ) knew of an oxygen generator having 
caused a smoke alarm  to activate . 
3.7.13.  For a more complete list of the testing and fault -finding carried out, see Appendix  1. 
3.8. Previous occurrences  
3.8.1.  Between 2000 and 2013 the operator had  had four other  incidents involving a loss of cabin 
pressure , although none had involved a rapid loss of pressure or the use of oxygen masks .  
Three had been  similar to the 30 August 2013 incident in as much as  the pilots received a 
cabin altitude warning but  no indication of a pressurisation system defect , and the cabin 
pressure  had continued to decrease  even though the aft outflow valve was closed.

pressure leak test , but was not included in flight operation manuals .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Cabin depressurisation events are rare but potentially dangerous.  The cabin pressurisation 
system operated normally on the flight from Auckland to Wellington.  On the return flight, 
shortly after the descent to Auckland began, the cabin pressure began dec reasing at a rate 
equivalent to a climb rate of up to 4,000 ft per minute .13 (A decrease in the cabin pressure is 
usually  expressed as an  increase in the cabin altitude .)  Pilots would normally detect such a 
rapid  decrease in cabin pressure  through  physiolo gical changes (for example, ear 'popping') .  
However,  in this case the cabin rate increase appears to have occurred just prior to  the cabin 
altitude warning horn  sounding , which gave no time for the flight crew to take pre -emptive 
action to control the pre ssure change . 
4.1.2.  In spite of extensive inspections a nd a detailed examination of key components of the 
pressurisation system, no definite cause was found for the loss of cabin pressure.  The 
following analysis discusses  a number of technical  factors that might have contributed to  the 
cabin depressurising . 
4.1.3.  This analysis  also discusses th e following three safety issues that we re identi fied in the inquiry : 
 non-adherence to the published emergency checklists for a loss of cabin 
pressure  
 the train ing of cabin crew in the use of  emergency oxygen equipment and the 
cabin depressurisation procedure  
 the possibility of the cabin being  pressurised on the ground following the use 
of the Cabin Altitude Warning checklist . 
4.2. Factors that affect cabin pressure  
To pressurise the cabin, air is supplied continuously from the engines via the air-conditioning 
packs.  The pressure is regulated by controlling the exit of air from the aft outflow valve.  
Therefore  the cabin pressure is affected by the following factors:  
 the inflow, or supply, of air  from the engines to the cabin  
 the controlled (regulated) leakage of air  from the cabin  
 any uncontrolled leakage of air  from the cabin . 
4.3. Defects that could cause a reduced air supply  
4.3.1.  Key components  of the air -conditioning and pressurisation system that are involved in the 
supply of cabin air are:  
 the engine bleed valves  
 the packs.  
4.3.2.  If the high stage14 bleed valve does  not open when the engine thrust is reduced to begin a 
descent, there w ill be  low air flow from t hat engine.  There have been  incidents where high 
stage bleed valves have had intermittent , but unidentifiable,  defects .  However, neither Boeing 
nor the operator was aware of  a high stage bleed valve defect having caused  the cabin  altitude 
to increase at  a rate exce eding  2,000 ft per minute . 
4.3.3.  The aeroplane had had various bleed air system defects in the four months preceding this 
occurrence , including low bleed (or 'duct') pressure from the engine s.  The most recent 
occurrence had been  a low  duct pressure during a descent , which occurred six weeks before 
this incident .  The high -pressure ('high -stage ') bleed valves for both engines had been  replaced  
                                                        
13 The more correct unit for the cabin rates recorded by the pressure controller is 'sea level feet per minute' . 
14 The 'high stage' bleed valves are at a later stage of the compressor section.  When they open, the higher -
pressure air maintains the required air mass flow for air -conditioning pack operation.  
 

<< Page 10 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -008 several  times .  Defects had occurred with other bleed air system components, mainly those 
connected with the left engine.   There had been no  other recorded defect s in the six weeks  
before this  incident . 
4.3.4.  On the incident flight t he pilots followed the usual pr ocedure  of setting both  packs to 
automatic  mode .  If one pack is providing no flow  when the packs are in automatic mode , the 
other automatically increase s its output to high flow.  There was no indication of that 
happen ing on this flight.  
4.3.5.  The engine bleed valves and the packs tested satisfactorily after the incident . 
4.4. Defects that could cause an excessive air outflow  
Controlled air outflow  
4.4.1.  The principal components invo lved with the controlled leak age or outflow of cabin air are:  
 the aft outflow valve  
 the forward outflow valve . 
4.4.2.  According to Boeing and the manufacturer of the outflow valve, the minor defects found with 
the valve were typical for its time in service .  They would not have caused the cabin pressure  to 
decrease  at the rate that it did . 
4.4.3.  The pressurisation control syste m also signals the forward outflow valve to close when the aft 
outflow valve is fully closed.  Because the aft valve remained closed for the rest of the flight, 
the forward valve would also have stayed closed.  This was a normal response of the system 
and, although it caused the 'Equipment cooling OFF' light to illuminate after landing ( see 
paragraph 3.2.9 ), it did not require any corrective maintenance action.  
Uncon trolled leakage  
4.4.4.  Uncontrolled leakage  can occur  at a number of places:  through door seals, where wire bundles 
and controls penetrate bulkhead s, from various drains, skin cracks and ruptures, and as a 
result of a defect in an air-conditioning  or pressurisation system component.  A malfunction of 
one of the aeroplane systems that was a minor user of bleed air would not , on its own , have 
caused the substantial loss of cabin pressure that occurred.15 
4.4.5.  An inspection of the aeroplane  prior to the ground test of the pressurisation system found no 
evidence of a structural factor having contributed to the incident.  However, a worn cabin entry 
door seal was identified and replaced.  In the leak-down tests the fuselage met the minimum 
requirement for reta ining pressure.  
4.4.6.  The fuselage was proven to be sufficiently air tight by remain ing partially pressurise d following  
the emergency procedure until after the landing . 
Safety relief valve s 
4.4.7.  Boeing confirmed that there had been cabin depressurisation events caused  by safety relief 
valve s activating unnecessarily while in the cruise .  However,  Boeing said it was unlikely  that 
the cabin differential pressure16 in this case had  increased to 8.1 pounds per square inch 
(psi), which was the lower pressure found during the 'crack ' testing of the safety relief valves  
fitted to this aeroplane (see paragraph 3.7.9 ).  This conclusion  was partly confirm ed by the 
post-incident verification flight, during which a climb was made to 37,000 ft with a flight 
                                                        
15 For example, the hydraulic and water systems  use bleed air to pressurise the fluid reservoirs . 
16 Differential pressure is the difference between the cabin air pressure and the outside air pressure.  
 
Final report AO -2013 -008 
<< Page 11 >>
 altitude of 36,000 ft set in the pressure controller (as for the incident flight).17  The differential 
pressure increased to only 7.9 psi compared with the normal cruise differential of 7.8 psi.  
Pressure controller  
4.4.8.  According to Boeing's description of the pressurisation system, t he 'Auto fail ' annunciator on 
the overhead panel should illuminate if the pressure controller sense s a sustained cabin rate 
of climb greater than 2,000 ft per minute.  That light  did not  illuminate during this incident, 
and the pressure controller did not record th at it had come on .  This  suggested that  the high 
climb rate observed by the pilots  was of very short dur ation .  Both digital pressure controllers 
tested satisfactorily after the incident , but both were replaced  as a precaution . 
Summary  
4.4.9.  No individual component of the cabin pressurisation system was identified as having cause d 
the loss of cabin pressure.  The outflow valve, selector panel and cabin pressure controller all 
have internal , built-in test functions that report any faults affecting the control of cabin 
pressure, whether intermittent or constant18, to the controller , which records these faults to 
non-volatile memory.  The non-volatile memory  data for this incident  was examined and no 
pressuri sation system failures were recorded.  The tear -down examination of those 
components revealed no faults.  Experience has shown t hat older pressurisation system 
components can have intermittent  faults that do not show during subsequent testing .  A 
combination of components with low or marginal perform ance could have  caused the incident , 
but no such combination was identified.   Boein g submitted that the cabin pressure continuing 
to decrease when the outflow valve was closed indicated a root cause that was related to 
insufficient cabin air inflow or excessive fuselage leakage.  
Finding s 
1. The cause of the loss of cabin pressure was not determined.  
2. An intermittent defect within the air -conditioning and  pressurisation system 
could not  be excluded as the cause  of the loss of cabin pressure . 
 
4.5. Response to the emergency  
Flight crew actions  
4.5.1.  Pilots and cabin crew must memorise and frequently practise emergency procedures so that 
they react promptly and correctly.  In particular, crew members must not delay putting on 
oxygen mask s as soon as  there is a clear indication of a loss of cabin pressure.  
4.5.2.  The pilot in command may take whatever action is necessary under the circumstances to 
ensure the safety  of everyone  on board .  That authority extends to vary ing an emergency 
checklist if conditions require it.  However, an unnecessary deviation from the publi shed 
emergency p rocedures is a safety issue if it is done without knowing why the step was in the 
checklist or the potential consequences  of the variation . 
4.5.3.  A loss of cabin pressure  is one of the few in -flight conditions that require an immediate, 
memorised  response by pilots.  The usual training for this event is a simulated rapid 
decompression while at cruise altitude.  Pilots frequently practise this exercise so the 
memorised actions counter the surprise and workload of an actual emergency, which  could 
otherwise lead to  their  making  error s.  However, this incident differed  from the practised 
scenario because the loss of cabin pressure occurred when the aeroplane was  already in a 
normal descent.  It was conceivable t hat the differen t circumstances  interfe red with the pilots' 
recall and performance of the memorised actions.  
                                                        
17 The conclusion  was not fully  confirmed  because other component s had been  change d after the incident and  the 
cabin pressure on the verification flight might not  have been exactly the same as it had been  on the incident flight.  
18 A constant or steady fault condition is sometimes said to be 'latched' . 
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report AO -2013 -008 4.5.4.  Both pilots fitted their oxygen masks immediately after they recognised the loss of cabin 
pressure . However,  their  actions varied from the published procedures in the following areas:  
 no cabin announcement was made to warn the cabin crew of the emergency descent  
 the flight deck 'passenger oxygen ' switch was not selected on  
 the subsequent checklist  reviews  were no t conducted out loud.  
4.5.5.  The pilot flying said that he did not warn the cabin  crew of the more rapid descent  because the 
aeroplane was already descen ding and he had heard the automatic passenger announcement 
to fit oxygen masks.  He concluded that the cabin crew would have realise d it was a real 
emergency.  Although t he operator concu rred with that reasoning , the cabin crew would have 
had no doubt if the pilot had made the required announcement . 
4.5.6.  The pilot monitoring said he did not turn on the passenger oxygen switch because the light 
associated with the switch was already illuminated and the automatic  passenger 
announcement was playing, both of which indicated that the masks had deployed.  However, 
there is some risk involved when pilots make their own decision s as to the necessity of  a step 
in an  emergency checklist.  Oxygen is not generated until a deployed mask is pulled down, so 
not selecting the flight deck switch did not prevent the supply of oxygen .  However, Boeing 
advised that the flight deck switch is a back -up to the cabin pressure switch that signals the 
masks to deplo y, and it should therefore be selected on.  The operator passed that advice to 
its pilots.  
4.5.7.  When reviewing the emergency checklists, the pilot monitoring did not read the steps out aloud 
as the operator's procedures required, although the pilot flying was a ware the review was 
taking place.  A different crew made the same omission during a simulator review of the 
incident conducted for the investigation.  The verbal review of a checklist is an important part 
of the emergency procedure s because it is a cross -check that the correct  actions have been 
performed completely . It gives pilots a shared understanding of the situation and any factors to 
be considered for the rest of the fligh t. 
4.5.8.  In this case the deviations were of a minor nature and did not affect the saf e outcome . 
Nevertheless,  the operator has, during annual training programmes for pilots, emphasis ed the 
importance of adhering to published checklists.  
4.5.9.  One of the pre -flight tasks of the pilot sitting in the right seat was to set t he planned cruise 
altitud e in the pressure control panel.  In this case the pilots left the selected altitude for the 
flight to Auckland at 36,000 ft, which  it had been  on the flight to Wellington, and did not reset 
it to 37,000 ft.  The right -seat pilot, who usually flew as a captain from the left seat,  had met  
the operator's minimum requirements for recent flying in the aeroplane from  the right seat.  
The minor error in setting the cruise altitude  could have been made by a ny pilot who regularly 
sat in the right seat.  However,  the operator's investigation into the incident noted that the 
error might "indicate a need for a more formalised currency program for pilots with 
management and administrative responsibilities ".19 
4.5.10.  One of the pilots made a radio call to air traffic control to advise of the emergency descent . He 
did not begin the message with the words , 'PAN, PAN, PAN', which are internationally 
recognised to mean an aircraft faces an urgent situation .  The Commission and other agencies 
have previously noted the omission of  the recognised words by pilots making radio call s to 
advis e of situation s of urgency (or distress ).20  In an earlier effort t o improve pilot compliance  
with this requirement  the CAA had included education on urgency and distress calls in one of 
its annual pilot education  programmes .21  The operator used this incident  in its  2014  recurrent

 training programme for pilots as an example  of the importance of using urgency and distress 
calls when appropriate.  
4.5.11.  In view of the improvements made by the operator to pilo t training, the Commission made no 
recommendation regarding any of the above issues . 
Finding  
3. The pilots did not follow exactly the emergency checklist  action s, which 
increased the risk of  an action being omitted  or a required sequence of 
actions  being altered . 
 
Response in the cabin  
4.5.12.  The c rew members of any pressurised aircraft must be acutely aware of the hazard of a loss of 
cabin  pressure .  The  'time of useful consciousness ' remaining after pressurisation is lost or the 
oxygen supply is interrupted  illustrates  the seriousness of the hazard  (see Appendix 3).  The 
time available cannot be predicted accurately because it depend s on the nature of the event 
and an individual's physiology and level of exertion at the time.  If a rapid depressurisation 
occurred a t 25,000 ft , the time of useful consciousness could be as little as 90 seconds .  
However, cognitive performance c ould be impaired more quickly, in which case the affected 
person might be unable to recall or take the required actions .  Therefore  it is imperative that a 
mask be fitted as soon as possible  and remain fitted until the wearer is instructed that it may 
be removed . 
4.5.13.  An incident i n the United States  in which  a Boeing 737 lost cabin pressure as a result of a 
structural failure  provides an ex ample of  the hazard .  One of the flight attendant s, who thought 
he could get a lot more done before having to put on a mask, lost consciousness and fell, 
suffering a fractured nose.22  A passenger who was also not wearing a  mask  tried to help the 
attendant  and also lost consciousness.  Both regained consciousness during the descen t. 
4.5.14.  On the incident flight to Auckland  there was no prior indication , such as a perceptible cabin air 
pressure change  or an announcement by a pilot , that the o xygen masks might  deploy . 
Nevertheless , all passengers followed t he standard instructions for fitting mask s that are given  
before every flight.   However, two cabin crew members delayed fitting mask s.  A delay in fitting 
a mask might lead to cognitive impairment  that could endanger the individual and  others . 
4.5.15.  The senior flight attendant, FA1, did not know  why she had not sat down  in the nearest 
available seat and fit ted a mask , as the crew had been  told to do .  A possible reason was that 
the limited range of  training scenarios had not required her to actually sit  down in a passenger 
seat if necessary .  She said that th e green flow indicator was visible  in the oxygen tubing  and 
she had not felt any lightheadedness . 
4.5.16.  Later i nspection showed that the oxygen generator at that position  had not been activated.   
Therefore FA1 had not been supplied  with oxygen .  It was highly likely that she saw only the 
edge of the flow indicator , which may be slightly visible even when there is no flow (see Figure 
4).  The opera tor's training for cabin crew had not demonstrated how the indicator becomes 
fully visible when oxygen is flowing .  The operator has since revised its cabin crew training to 
describe and demonstrate the oxygen system more accurately .

(Picture from the operator)  
4.5.17.  Tests by the operator showed that improper packing of the oxygen mask was the likely reason 
for the generator at the front left door, where F A1 stood , failing to activate.  Another test on a 
different Boeing 737 found some improperly packed passenger oxygen masks.  Even though 
each row of seats had a spare mask, the improper packing or maintenance of equipment that 
is critical to life support i s a potential safety issue  on all aeroplane types.   The operator 
reviewed the quality control of the maintenance of oxygen units across its fleets and deemed 
no further action was necessary.  Therefore  the Commission made no recommendation on this 
matter.23 
4.5.18.  When the cabin oxygen masks deployed  FA2 continued to push the cart 'uphill ' to the rear 
galley .  One possible reason for her doing this was the sub conscious  association of the crew 
station with safety , because the cabin crew training demonstrations tende d to occur at the 
crew stations rather than in the cabin aisles .  This extra  effort would have required additional 
oxygen and delayed her putting on a mask .  The correct action would have been to apply the 
cart brakes , fit the nearest spare mask  and, if possible, take a seat  and remain seated .  Four 
masks are available for each set of three passenger seats.  
4.5.19.  After the incident both of the rear galley oxygen  units were found to have been activated.  FA3 , 
who was already in the rear galley, fitted a  mask from the unit at the right rear door and  had no 
concern for the  oxygen flow.  Therefore  FA2 might have been mistaken  (like FA1) in thinking 
she was not getting oxygen .  Both flight attendants received oxygen from the unit at the left 
rear door.  
Crew training and procedures  
4.5.20.  Crew members must be completely familiar with the emergency equipment  installed  for the 
passengers' and their own safety.  FA1's incorrect interpretation of the oxygen mask flow 
indicator and FA2's delay in putting on  a mask  suggested some  unfamiliarity with the 
equipment and the actions to be taken  for a pressurisation incident , which  indicat ed a need to 
improve  the cabin crew training  programme and resources . 
4.5.21.  The operator submitted that depressurisation and the associated pr ocedures and equipment 
were  covered in detail during initial and recurrent training for crews.  The training involve d 
lectures, videos and practical exercises.  However, the operator also submitted that the 
observed cabin crew procedural non -conformances m ight have been due to the artificiality of 
the training scenarios .  To reduce the potential for lapses like those seen in this incident, the 
operator instituted monthly crew briefing questions and assessment s of individual competency 
in the depressurisatio n drills during the annual line checks . 
4.5.22.  In view of the improvements made by the operator to cabin crew training, the Commission 
made no recommendation regarding any of the above issues . 
                                                        
23 Air New Zealand subsequently disposed of its Boeing 737 fleet in 2014 .

 4.5.23.  The cabin crew responded appropriately to the toilet smoke alarms by t reating them as 
genuine alarms.  They were unable to silence the alarms in the normal way.  Cabin crew are 
informed during their training that false smoke alarms can occur , but it was not generally 
known that a spike in the cabin pressure could cause a fal se alarm . 
Finding  
4. The actions  of some of the cabin crew during the incident  showed that their 
emergency training had not sufficiently stressed the importance of sitting 
down and fitting a mask without delay, and had not allowed for a range of 
scenarios  or adequately familiarised the crew with the oxygen equipment.  
4.6. Cabin Altitude Warning  checklist  
4.6.1.  Normally, when the pressurisation system is in automatic mode, the outflow valve opens upon 
landing to depressurise the cabin  fully.  After pilots have carrie d out the Cabin Altitude Warning  
checklist  the pressur isation system will be in the manual  mode .  Unless the pilots open  the 
outflow valve  while  in manual mode, the valve will remain  closed  on landing . 
4.6.2.  The Boeing manuals did not explain that th e system configuration after performing the Cabin 
Altitude Warning checklist could  allow the cabin to r e-pressuris e.  The cabin doors were 'plug' -
type doors that move d inwards slightly before opening outwards.  If there is any significant 
cabin pressure, a door cannot be physically opened.  Therefore if the cabin is not fully 
depressurised on the ground , the doors will be difficult or impossible to open , and this would 
hinder an emergency evacuation if that were needed .24  In this case the aeroplane was slightly 
pressurised after landing  and the crew were  initially unable  to open the cabin door after the 
engine shutdown.  
4.6.3.  The operator said that the re-pressurisation scenar io had not been anticipated before this 
incident, and therefore its Boeing 737 pilots had not been trained for it.  The Cabin Altitude 
Warning checklist did not require pilots to ensure that the aeroplane was depressurised before 
landing.   In contrast, the  checklist for a nother  condition  for which manual mode is selected , 
'Unscheduled Pressuri zation Change ', had a 'Deferred Item' that called for the aft outflow 
valve  to be opened manually  before landing.25 
4.6.4.  Boeing later advised that it had added the Deferred Items of the 'Unscheduled  Pressurization 
Change ' checklist to the C abin Altitude  Warning  checklist, to direct pilots control ling the 
aeroplane  pressure manually to open the outflow valve upon landing .  For this reason the 
Commission did not make a recommendation regarding the checklist content.  
 
  
                                                        
24 For this reason the Ground Evacuation  checklist requ ires pilots to open the aft outflow valve fully  manually 
before giving the 'Evacuate ' command.  
25 A deferred item was an emergency checklist action that was performed at a later stage, typically during a routine 
checklist.  In the example cited, the outflow valve would be opened manually prior to the usual  Landing  checklist.

 Final report AO -2013 -008 5. Findings  
5.1 The cause of the loss of cabin pressure was not determined.  
5.2 An intermittent defect within the air -conditioning and  pressurisation system could not  be 
excluded as the cause  of the loss of cabin pressure . 
5.3 The pilots did not follow exactly the emergency checklist actions, which increased the risk of 
an action being omitted or a required sequence of actions being altered.  
5.4 The actions of s ome of the cabin crew during  the incident showed that their emergency 
training had not sufficiently stressed the importance of sitting down and fitting a mask 
without delay, and had not allowed for a range of scenarios  or adequately familiarised the 
crew with the oxygen equipment.

 6. Safety a ctions  
6.1. General  
6.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
6.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2.1.  The operator took action to improve crew performance in the following areas : 
 the declaration by pilots of an emergency (distress or urgency) situation  
 flight crew adherence to the published emergency  checklists  
 cabin crew actions in response to a depressurisation . 
6.2.2.  The operator took action to improve the following aspects of training:  
 oxygen mask training with gas flow, and familiarity with chemical oxygen generators.  
6.2.3.  The operator reviewed  the quality control of the packing of oxygen mask s across it s fleets and 
deemed that no further action was necessary . 
6.2.4.  On 2 June 201 6 Boeing advised that it had added the Deferred Items of the 'Unscheduled  
Pressurization Change ' checklist to the C abin Altitude  Warning  checklist, to direct pilots 
control ling aeroplane  pressure manually to open the outflow valve upon landing.

 Final report AO -2013 -008 7. Recommendations  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , because of the safety actions taken by the operator and the key lessons 
identified, no recommendations have been issued.  
  
 
Final report AO -2013 -008 
<< Page 19 >>
 8. Key lesson s 
8.1 The following lessons were identified during the inquiry into this occurrence:  
 an unexpected loss of cabin pressure in any aeroplane is a serious event that can cause 
both passengers and crew  to lose consciousness  rapidly  from a lack of oxygen.  In such an 
event the appropriate  emergency  actions must be undertaken  immediately.  Where oxygen 
masks are fitted, passengers and  cabin crew must  put on their masks and await further 
instruction from the flight crew  
 the purpose of emergency procedure checklists is to ensure that crew members do not 
miss an important action at a critical  time of high workload.   Therefore, unless the captain 
has an exceptional  reason to deviate from  a checklist, it should be performed from 
beginning to end, if  possible  without interruption, and without omitting any step  
 crew members must be thoroughly trained in and familiar with all emergency equipmen t 
and procedures, because  the equipment and procedures are for their own protection as 
well as that of the passengers.  They need to be alert for  emergency situations that differ 
from the standard scen arios that are practised  and demonstrated repeatedly  
 an aircraft door will be very difficult to open on the ground while the cabin is still 
pressurised , and this can delay an evacuation if it is called for .  When pilots have been 
controlling the cabin pressure manually, they must ensure that the cabin is ful ly 
depressurised to allow the doors to be opened  
 special care must be taken with the maintenance of aircraft emergency equipment,  such 
as oxygen systems.

 Appendix 1 : Boeing 737 -300 technical information  
Pressuri sation system  
1. Bleed air for the cabin air conditioning and pressurisation is supplied from the fifth or ninth 
compressor stage of the engines  (see Figure  3).26  The pressure at the fifth stage is adequate 
except when th e engine is at idle or a low thrust setting , in which case the ninth  ('high') stage 
valve automatically opens to suppl y the air.   The pressure of the bleed air from each engine is 
indicated on the flight deck  overhead panel .  If the bleed air temperature or pressure is 
excessive, a shut-off valve c loses and this is indicated to the pilots.  
2. Aeroplane pressurisation control includes the pressurisation control system, pressure relief 
valves and the indication and warning system.  The pressurisation control system is electrically 
operated and electronic ally controlled , and comprises a control panel, two digital pressur e 
controllers and the aft outflow valve  (see Figure 5). 
3. The forward outflow valve  shown in F igure 5 is part of the cargo heating system, but the 
pressur e control panel (in automatic or manual mode) signal s the valve to close  when the aft 
outflow valve is almost fully closed.  This prevent s the forward outflow valve adversely 
affecting the cabin pressure . 
4. The pressure control panel, located on the flight deck overhead panel, allows the pi lots to 
select the system mode, enter the flight and landing altitudes, and control the aft outflow 
valve  manually  (see Figure 6).  System status annunciators27, including the cabin altitude 
warning, are located on the forward and overhead instrument panels .  Adjacent to the 
pressure control panel are a combined cabin altitude and differential pressure gauge and a 
cabin rate -of-climb gauge.  
5. The pressurisation control system has three modes of operation , selected on the control 
panel : 
 automatic  (AUTO) - the n ormal mode .  This requires only that the pilots enter the flight 
and landing altitude s into the control panel before take -off, and have the correct 
barometric pressure set for landing   
 alternate - a redundant automatic mode .  This mode takes over if the AUTO mode fails  
 manual - for when the AUTO and alternate modes fail.  The position of the aft outflow 
valve is controlled directly by the pilots using a switch on the control panel.

6. Two identical digital pressure controllers  located in the underfloor equipment compartment  
sense the cabin pressure.  Interfaces with other aeroplane systems enable the controllers  to 
determine the flight phase .  When the system is in automat ic mode, one controller is operating 
and in command of the outflow valve  position .  The other is on standby , but monitoring the 
system  and m imicking the controller in command .  The pressure controllers  determine the 
lowest possible cabin altitude  that can be maintained during the flight  and create a 
corresponding schedule of pressure change .  The operative controller sends signal s to the aft 
outflow valve to adjust its exhaust area to maintain th e schedule . 
7. The pressure controllers also limit the rate of ch ange of cabin pressure whe n climbing and 
descending, and limit the differential pressure.28  If the pressure controller's internal limit for 
differential pressure is exceeded, one or both independent safety relief valves open and 
prevent the differential exceeding 8.5 psi.29  The safety relief valves close when the differential 
pressure returns to the allowable range .  A negative relief valve is also installed to prevent  the 
atmospheric pressure exc eeding the cabin pressure.  
8. If the cabin altitude exceeds 10 ,000 ft, an aural warning sound s in the flight deck and a red 
CABIN ALT (altitude) annunciator illuminates on the forward instrument panel.  If the system is 
in automatic mode, separate pressure sensors on the electric actuators of the aft outflow 
valve co mmand the valve to close when the cabin altitude exceeds 14,500 ft.  
9. When the pressurisation system is in automatic mode , the aft outflow valve  is commanded to 
open after landing so that the cabin pressure equalises with that outside.  
  
                                                        
28 Differential pressure is the difference between the cabin pressure and the outside air pressure.   When the 
cabin is pressurised, the differential pressure is positive.  Excessive differential pre ssure can lead to structural 
damage.  
29 The maximum differential pressure f or flights above 28,000 ft  is 7.8 psi.  A t lowe r altitudes it is 7.45 psi.

 Oxygen system  
10. Supplemental gaseous oxygen is provided for the pilots.  
11. A unit  above each row of three seats contain s one chemical oxygen generator and four masks.  
Above each set of cabin crew seats and in each toilet  there is one generator with two masks .  
All units open automatically and deploy the masks if an altitude sensor that is independent of 
the pressurisation system detects the cabin altitude to be above 14,000 ft, or if the passenger 
oxygen switch on the flight deck is selected o n.   
12. Deployed ox ygen masks hang approximately 18 centimetres  below the service units  and each 
must be pulled down to reach the face of a sitting person.  Pulling down any mask releas es a 
safety pin from the associated generator  and starts the chemical reaction to produc e oxygen .  
Unwanted reaction products are filtered from the gas that flows to all of the attached masks .  
When oxygen is flowing a  green indicator should be clearly visible in the transparent supp ly 
tubing . 
13. The operator's Cabin Safety Manual note d that the chemical reaction produce d significant 
local heat and a 'hot' smell.  A heat -sensitive tape on the casing of each generator discolours 
if the generator has activated.  
Toilet  smoke alarms  
14. The toilet  smoke detectors were of the ionising type  in whi ch a weak radioactive source 
ionise s the air and produce s a small electrical current .  Smo ke particles enter ing the detector  
interrupt the current , which  sets off the alarm.  
15. Newer models of the Boeing 737 use photo -electric detectors that are not affected  by 
pressure spikes , and are better suited to detecting a smouldering fire , which is more typical of 
a toilet  fire. 
Post-incident fault finding  
16. The manufacturer of the digital pressure controllers (Nord -Micro, in Germany) retrieved the 
data stored in the co ntrollers.  The controllers had no internal faults and had operated 
correctly in automatic mode.  Approximately 90 seconds prior to the cabin altitude warning, 
when the aeroplane was descending through 34,000 ft, the pressure controller that was in 
control  recorded an 'inflow/leakage fail ' status .  That meant that the re was  a low inflow of air 
or an excessive air leakage, or perhaps both conditions.  The controller correctly signalled the 
outflow valve to close to stop any further decrease in the cabin pressure.  The cabin altitude 
exceeded 14,300 ft when the aeroplane was descending through 26,700 ft  flight altitude , but 
the maximum cabin altitude (which would allow the minimum cabin pressure to be 
determined) was not recorded.  
17. The following fault finding was accomplished for the Commission's inquiry or by the operator:  
 satisfactory tests of both pres sure controllers  before their removal from the aeroplane  
 replacement of both pressure controllers  
 analysis of data stored in the removed pressure controllers  
 visual inspection of the fuselage, wheel wells, cargo compartments, bulkheads and all 
openings, fo r structural defects  
 a worn cabin entry door seal was replaced as a precaution  
 downloads of the cockpit voice recorder, digital flight recorder and quick -access 
recorder  
 satisfactory check of pitot -static plumbing30 
 check of relevant electrical wiring  
                                                        
30 The pitot -static system involves dynamic and static air pressures, which are  input s to the pressure controllers.

 Appendix 3: Time of useful consciousness  
Time of useful consciousness (TUC)  
This is the period of time from interruption of the oxygen supply, or exposure to an oxygen -poor 
environment, to the time when an individual is no longer capable of taking proper corrective and 
protective action.31  The faster the rate of ascent, the worse the impairment and the faster it happens.  
TUC also decreases with increasing altitud e.  The table  below shows the trend of TUC as a function of 
altitude.  However, a slow depressurisation is as dangerous as or more dangerous than a rapid 
depressurisation .  By its nature, a rapid de pressurisation  commands attention.  In contrast, a slow 
depressurisation  may go unnoticed and the resultant hypoxia32 may be unrecogni sed.
