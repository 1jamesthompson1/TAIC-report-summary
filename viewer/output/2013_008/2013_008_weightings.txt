","0.0","10.0","The pilots did not follow the emergency checklist actions exactly, which ""increased the risk of an action being omitted or a required sequence of actions being altered"" (5.3). This indicates that human error and assumptions played a role in the incident.
","0.0","20.0","The document indicates issues with training and competency, particularly with the cabin crew's response to the emergency and their familiarity with the oxygen equipment (4.5.14-4.5.22). The actions of some cabin crew during the incident showed that their emergency training had not sufficiently stressed the importance of sitting down and fitting a mask without delay (5.4).
","0.0","20.0","The cabin crew's response to the emergency and their handling of the oxygen equipment suggest a lack of familiarity with the equipment. FA1's incorrect interpretation of the oxygen mask flow indicator and FA2's delay in putting on a mask suggested some unfamiliarity with the equipment (4.5.20).

","0.0","5.0","The incident differed from the usual training scenario because the loss of cabin pressure occurred during a normal descent, which may have interfered with the pilots' recall and performance of the memorized actions (4.5.3).
","0.0","10.0","The cabin crew's response to the emergency indicates a lack of preparedness for the situation, as evidenced by the delay in fitting oxygen masks and the incorrect interpretation of the oxygen flow indicator (4.5.14-4.5.22).
