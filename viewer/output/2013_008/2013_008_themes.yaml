- name: Cabin Pressurization System Reliability
  explanation: The reliability of the cabin pressurization system is a critical safety theme in this accident because the incident involved an unexplained loss of cabin pressure. The analysis revealed that "no definite cause was found for the loss of cabin pressure" (4.1.2), and "an intermittent defect within the air-conditioning and pressurisation system could not be excluded as the cause of the loss of cabin pressure" (5.2). This indicates that the reliability of the system is in question, and any potential defects or intermittent issues within the system pose a significant safety risk.
- name: Adherence to Emergency Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to emergency procedures is a key safety theme because the pilots did not follow the emergency checklist actions exactly as prescribed, which "increased the risk of an action being omitted or a required sequence of actions being altered" (5.3). Specific deviations included not making a cabin announcement to warn the cabin crew of the emergency descent, not selecting the flight deck 'passenger oxygen' switch on, and not conducting checklist reviews out loud (4.5.4-4.5.7). These deviations from established procedures could have had serious consequences in a different situation.
- name: Crew Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  explanation: Crew training and familiarity with emergency equipment is a significant safety theme because the actions of some cabin crew members during the incident indicated a lack of familiarity with the oxygen equipment and the importance of fitting a mask without delay (5.4). The senior flight attendant did not activate the oxygen generator and had an incorrect interpretation of the oxygen mask flow indicator (4.5.16), and another flight attendant delayed fitting a mask (4.5.18). This suggests that the training did not adequately prepare the crew for a range of scenarios or familiarize them sufficiently with the equipment.
- name: Communication During Emergencies
  explanation: Effective communication during emergencies is a crucial safety theme, as evidenced by the pilot's omission of the internationally recognized urgency signal "PAN, PAN, PAN" during the radio call to air traffic control (4.5.10). This could have led to misunderstandings about the severity of the situation. Additionally, the lack of a cabin announcement by the pilot flying could have left the cabin crew uncertain about the nature of the emergency (4.5.5).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection of Safety Equipment
  explanation: The maintenance and inspection of safety equipment is a relevant safety theme because the incident revealed potential issues with the packing and maintenance of oxygen masks. Improper packing of the oxygen mask was identified as the likely reason for the failure of an oxygen generator to activate (4.5.17). This highlights the importance of proper maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the functionality of critical safety equipment.
- name: Manual Mode Procedures After Emergency Checklists
  explanation: Procedures for manual mode operation of the pressurization system after emergency checklists are a pertinent safety theme. The incident brought to light that the Cabin Altitude Warning checklist did not require pilots to ensure that the airplane was depressurized before landing, which could lead to difficulties in opening cabin doors on the ground (4.6.1-4.6.2). This oversight in the checklist could have serious implications for passenger evacuation in an emergency.
