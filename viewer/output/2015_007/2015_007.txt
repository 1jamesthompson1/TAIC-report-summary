The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry  and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiri es is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regula tory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Saturday 21 November 2015, an Airbus Helicopters AS350 ( 'Squirrel ') helicopter was 
conducting flights out of the operator's base near  Fox Glacier  town .  The weather conditions 
that morning had caused the cancellation and postponement of several flight s. 
1.2. The pilot decided that the weather had improved enough to conduct a scenic flight with 
passengers to the head of  the Fox Glacier  valley.  At 0945 the helicopter depart ed with the 
pilot and six passengers on board for a n expected  20-minute flight.  The weather was cloudy 
and changeable as the flight departed.  Weather  permitting, the flight was to include a snow 
landing on Chancellor Shelf above the glacier.  The pilot s poke with the pilot of another 
helicopter flying in the neighbouring Franz Jose f Glacier  valley .  That was the last radio contact 
with the helicopter.  
1.3. The helicopter was reported overdue at 1015.  The subsequent search located the wreckage 
of the helicopte r.  It had crashed onto the glacier just below Chancellor Shelf.  There were no 
survivors and the helicopter was destroyed.  
1.4. Images obtained from some passengers' cameras  helped  to trace the approximate track of 
the helicopter.  The helicopter had landed on  Chancellor Shelf and the passengers had got out 
to walk in the snow.  It was snowing at the time and cloud was coming and going in the 
general area.   There was no recorded evidence of the helicopter's flight path after it departed  
Chancellor Shelf.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  it unlikely that a 
mechanical failure with the helicopter was a factor in the accident.  Although not al l of the 
wreckage was r ecovered , an examination of the recovered components (including all the 
dynamic assemblies) revealed no pre-existing failure . 
1.6. The Commission also found  that the weather conditions on the day were unstable and 
unsuitable for conducting a scenic flight.  The localised we ather conditions in the area were 
very likely to have been frequently below the minimum criteria required by the Civil Aviation 
Rules.  
1.7. It is very likely that when the helicopter took off from Chancellor Shelf and descended down 
the valley , the pilot's perc eption of the helicopter's height above  the terrain was affected by 
one or more of the following conditions:  
 cloud 
 precipitation  
 flat light conditions  
 condensation on the helicopter 's front windscreen . 
1.8. The Commission found  that the pilot had not been properly  trained and did not have the 
appropriate level of experience  expected under the operator's categorisation scheme for a 
senior pilot in this type of operation .  The operator's system for training its pilots was ill -
defined and did not comply fully with the Civil Aviation Rules.  
1.9. The operator's training system did not have sufficient oversight by the designated senior 
persons, and this was a factor that allowed the pilot to be assigned roles and responsibilities 
without the proper  training and experience.  
1.10.  The Commission found  that the Civil Aviation Authority had identified significant  non-
compliance issues with the operator's training system and manage rial oversight that had 
warranted  interven tion long before this accident occurre d.  
1.11.  The Commission identified two safety issues : 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007  the operator's system for training its pilots did not comply fully with the requirements of  the 
Civil Aviation Rules  or the operator's  approved  operations specifications , and did not 
adequately prepare the pilot for the role and responsibilities required for flight operations 
that day  
 the operator had been allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations with little or 
no intervention from the Civil Aviation Authority, in spite of the Authority having  identified 
significant non -compliances with the operator's training system and managerial oversight . 
1.12.  In 2014 t he Commission had made a recommendation  to the Director of Civil Aviation that 
stricter requirements be placed upon holders of air operator certi ficates to correct identified 
deficiencies, and that when  serious safety issues were  found, they always result ed in audit  
findings . 
1.13.  The Commission is concerned that other operators in the civil aviation system during the same 
period could be operating with  non-compliances  that have either not been identified by the 
Civil Aviation Authority's  surveillance system or not been resolved.  Therefore , the Commission 
has made a new recommendation  to the Director of Civil Aviation  that they  initiate an 
independent r eview of past Civil Aviation Authority surveillance activities.  
1.14.  The key lessons  arising from this  inquiry include : 
 aircraft operators' senior management have a regulatory duty to maintain proper and 
effective oversight of their operation s.  Doing  otherwise  will compromise the safety of the 
operation s and increase the risk of repeat accidents  
 proper training of pilots is critical to the safety of air operations.  Any training and 
competency system must ensure that pilots are trained and experienced to level s 
appropriate for their role s and responsibilities  
 every operator must provide adequate supervision of its pilots, appropriate to the  pilots'  
experience  and training and the nature of the operation s 
 aircraft manufacturers set 'never exceed' l imitation s for good reason s.  Pilots should not, 
under any circumstances , load or operate their aircraft outside the limitation s 
 with knowledge comes responsibility.  If a senior person working for an air operator or an 
inspector  working for the regulator identif ies a serious safety issue with an operation, the 
issue should be formally raised and action taken to  address  it.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On Saturday 21 November 2015 the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) of the helicopter crash.  The 
Commission subsequently opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Tran sport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990  and appointed an investigator in charge . 
2.2. Two Commission investigators, an inv estigation support staff member  and a contracted 
aircraft engineer familiar with the helicopter type  travelled to Fox Glacier town  on 21 
November 2015 .  A third Commission investigator travelled to Fox Glacier town four days later.  
2.3. The CAA notified the State of aircraft manufacture (France) and the State of engine 
manufacture (United States)  of the accident, in accordance with the pr ovisions of Annex 13 to 
the Convention on International Civil Aviation.  France appointed an investigator from the 
Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses  (BEA  - the independent air accident investigation authority 
of France ) as its Accredited Representative , and the United States appointed an investigator 
from the National T ransportation Safety Board as its representative.  Both appointed technical 
advisers from the respective manufacturers to assist  them . The Commission held 
teleconferences with the BEA and A irbus Helicopters  (the helicopter manufacturer)  at various 
times during the inquiry.  
2.4. The Commission also notified the independent accident investigation authorities of Australia 
and the United Kingdom that citizens of their countries were among the victims . 
2.5. The site investigation began o n 22 November 2015 , but progress was slowed by inclement 
weather and hazardous  site conditions .  On 24 November 2015, p rior to any wreckage 
removal, a remotely piloted aircraft was used to photograph  and map the site.  
2.6. The Co mmission took control of the site from New Zealand  Police on 26 November 2015.  
Accessible wreckage was removed from the site  later that day  and sent to the Commission's 
facility near Wellington .  The investigation team completed their initial activities i n the area on 
27 November 2015.  
2.7. On 4 December 2015 an ice fall covered the forward part of the fuselage that had been left at 
the site because it was wedged across a crevasse.  On 8 December 2015 the Commission 
decided that it could not recover safely the remaining fuselage and smaller items of interest . 
2.8. Investigators in terview ed staff from the helicopter operator  (Fox and Franz Heli  Services ), 
glacier guides who had flown with the pilot on the day of the accident , and other witnesses.  
Maintenance docu ments  and operational records relating to the helicopter  were obtained 
from the operator, along with the  pilot's training file and logbook.  
2.9. The pilot's personal and aviation medical histor ies were reviewed.  Investigators obtained 
evidence from an instruct or and three flight examiners who had trained or flown with the pilot, 
and two former employers.  
2.10.  On 21 December 2015 the engine was inspected with assistance from the manufacturer's 
representative in New Zealand.   Between 25 February 2016 and 1 March 2016 the 
investigator in charge supervised fuller examinations of the engine and its accessories at the 
premises of the respective manufacturers in the United States.  
2.11.  Between 27 January 2016 and 29 January 2016 the wreckage was examined at the 
Commission's Well ington facility by the Commission 's investigat ion team , the Accredited 
Representative of France , two other  investigators from the BEA and a n investigator from 
Airbus Helicopters.  
2.12.  The engine -aircraft adapter shaft was examined by Airbus Helicopters under th e supervision of 
the BEA on behalf of the Commission, and a report was prepared for  the Commission.  

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 2.13.  On 31 March 2016 the investigator in charge and a team of glacier guides recovered  items of 
wreckage that had been exposed by summer melting  of the ice .  The forward fuselage and 
cabin  remained buried under  an ice fall . 
2.14.  Cameras and mobile phones that had been recovered from the accident site were forensically 
examined and relevant photos, videos and location data were reviewed.  
2.15.  In July 2016 senior persons of the operator were interviewed again, as well as other 
witnesses.  
2.16.  In October 2016 the hydraulic flight control servos2 from the helicopter were taken to Australia 
for functional testing and inspection, under the supervision of the investigator in charge.  
2.17.  MetService New Zealand3 analysed the weather conditions at , and prior to , the time of the 
accident  and provided a  report to the Commission.  
2.18.  The CAA files relating to the pilot, the operator and the helicopter were reviewed.  Commission 
investigators interv iewed CAA staff who had conducted  audit s of the operator  and guided  the 
operator  in regard  to compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules.  The CAA manage rs responsible 
for regulatory oversight of the helicopter sector were also interviewed.   The Commission 
reviewed CAA documents relating to the suspension in May 2016 of the operator's air 
operator certificate and the subsequent prosecution of some individuals.  
2.19.  In September 2017 the original investigator in charge resigned from the Commission and a 
new investi gator in charge was appointed to complete the draft report . 
2.20.  On 21 November 2018  the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to interested 
persons for  their  comment.   The response time for submissions was extended following a 
request from an interested person.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  The operator offered scenic flights in the Southern Alps from its main bases at Franz Josef and 
Fox Glacier town s and from three other South Island locations . The flights were conducted 
outside controlled airspace and under visual flight rules .4 
3.1.2.  There was one pilot (the pilot) on flying duty at the Fox Glacier base on Saturday 21 November 
2015 .  At about 0700 ground staff  called the pilot to discuss the weather and scheduled flying 
for that day.  Th ree scenic flights had already been  cancelled because of unsuitable  weather , 
and two other flights t o take professional glacier guides to the lower Fox Glacier  had been 
postponed . 
3.1.3.  At about  0815 the pilot  decided to fly the glacier guides to the lower glacier  landing site .  
Ground staff  told the pilot  that six people were waiting for  a scenic flight  if conditions were 
suitable.  The pilot told the ground staff that during the flights t o take  in the guides , they would 
be able  to see if the weather conditions around the upper g lacier were suitable for a scenic 
flight.  
3.1.4.  At about 0900 the pilot carried out a pre -flight inspection of an Airbus Helicopters AS350 
'Squirrel' helicopter, registered ZK -HKU (the helicopter).  At 0920 the first of two flights with  
glacier guides  departed t he operator's Fox Glacier base .  During one of the flights the pilot 
radioed the ground staff to say that  the weather was suitable for a scenic flight .  After the 
second flight the ground staff refuelled the helicopter to 40% of its fuel capacity.  
3.1.5.  The passengers  had purchased a 30 -minute flight over the Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers , 
including  a snow landing .  The ground staff said that the passengers had been informed that  
the flight would likely be shorte ned and might not include a snow landing  because  of the 
inclement weather . 
3.1.6.  A frequently used location for snow landing s was Chancellor Shelf , at 5,600 f eet (ft) (1,720 
metres  [m]) altitude.5  The shelf  offer ed a suitable  landing area that could  be approache d from 
almost any direction  and drop ped away steeply into the glacial valley  (see Figure 1).  
3.1.7.  The helicopter departed on the scenic flight  at 0945 .  Once airborne  the pilot radioed the 
ground staff and asked them to telephone the operator's Franz Josef office and ask about the 
weather there.  The Franz Jose f office did not answer the call , so the ground staff suggested t o 
the pilot that the flight be shorten ed.  The pilot then contacted  another , more senior , company 
pilot who was flying near Franz Josef , 16 k ilometres  north of Fox Glacier  town .  The other  pilot 
said conditions were unsuitable  over Franz Josef Glacier , which ruled out the flight extending 
to both glaciers . 
3.1.8.  At about 0950 two pilots for another operator were flying  in to the lower Fox Glacier  landing 
site and  heard t he pilot repor t on the local radio  frequency that the helicopter was overhead 
the terminal face of Fox Glacier at 3,200 ft (975 m), heading east.  One of these pilots later 
saw the helicopter climbing towards Chancellor Shelf.  That was the last sighting of  the 
helicopter . 
3.1.9.  The helicopter was expected back at the Fox Glacier base at 1005 .  When it did not return t he 
ground staff radioed the pilot several times , but got no response.   The ground staff made 
various telephone and radio calls to try to contact  the helicopter , then declar ed it overdue at 
1015 .  The  pilot at Franz Josef was asked to conduct a search.  That pilot could not fly directly 
                                                        
4 Visual flight rules include requirements for the flight visibility and clearance from cloud to be above 
spec ified minima.   
5 Altitude is the height above mean sea level . New Zealand is one of many countries that use feet rather than 
metres for the measurement of heights and altitudes in aviation.  This is permitted by Annex 5 to the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation.

Glacier town  then followed the operator's  scenic flight  route up Fox Glacier . 
3.1.10.  During the search , fresh helicopter landing skid tracks were seen in the snow on Chancellor 
Shelf.  After search ing for  approximately 10 more minutes the search pilot found the wreckage  
of the hel icopter .  It had  crashed near the right edge6 of the upper Fox Glacier, about 600 m 
south of and 800 ft (244 m) below Chancellor Shelf (see Figure s 1, 2 and 3 ). 
 
Figure 1 
Chancellor Shelf, with accident site below  
3.2. Site information  
3.2.1.  A remotely piloted aircraft was used to make the initial record of the accident site  before the 
recovery teams began work .  See Appendix 1 for a summary of the recovered wreckage . 
3.2.2.  The glacier  was heavily crevassed  where the helicopter crashed .  There was no sign of the 
helicopter having struck the terrain or any object between Chancellor S helf and where it 
crashed.  
3.2.3.  The initial impact was approximately 40 m from the right edge of the glacier.  The wreckage 
was spread in a south -west direction o ver an area approximately 40 m long by 20 m wide (see 
Figure 4).  The first items in the trail were pieces of the landing gear skids and the lower 
fuselage 'belly' panel, the lower vertical stabiliser and the tail cone .  The lower vertical 
stabiliser was s heared off in a rearward direction.  The attached tail rotor guard was 
undamaged.  
3.2.4.  The rest of the wreckage was mainly in two areas.  The first included the tail boom with tail 
rotor assembly still attached.  The upper vertical stabiliser and both horizonta l stabilisers also 
remained attached to the tail boom.  The underside of the tail boom had no obvious impact 
damage.  An empty steel ski basket, which had been attached to the left side of the landing

 gear, was lying on top of the tail boom.  The underside  of the ski basket had a large , concave 
impression.  
3.2.5.  The other substantial wreckage area included most of the fuselage, the engine and the main 
rotor assembly.  This was approximately 35 m away, wedged over a crevasse at the base of a 
15 m high ice wall.  T he fuselage was lying on its left side.  The engine had detached from the 
engine deck.  
3.2.6.  The four transmission suspension bars that attach ed the main transmission assembly  to the 
fuselage had sheared , causing the assembly to detach from the fuselage.  The rotor shaft and 
the rotor head with attached blades  were still attached to the main transmission .  One of the 
three main rotor blades was broken about 2 m from the hub, but the other two had little 
damage on their leading edges and were lying either side of an ice mound.  
3.2.7.  Smaller items of wreckage were scattered within a 30 -degree arc centred on a line joining the 
tail boom to the fuselage.  These items included the dual front passenger seat, the cabin 
doors and the pilot's instrument panel.  The fuel tank had  ruptured and contaminated the site 
with fuel, but there was no fire.  
3.2.8.  During the recovery of the wreckage the cabin structure forward of the cabin bulkhead broke 
away.  It could not be inspected or recovered and was subsequently buried by a  collapsing  ice 
wall.

 3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  The AS350 is a single turbine engine -powered light utility helicopter manufactured in France 
by Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters).  The main structural components are shown in Figure 
5. 
 
Figure 5 
AS350 helicopter parts  
(Photo graph courtesy of the operator)  
3.3.2.  The helicopter had been  manufactured in 1979 as an AS350BA variant with an Arriel 
turboshaft engine , and imported into New Zealand in 1995.  The engine had been  replaced 
with a Lycoming (now Honeywell) LTS101 -600A-3A engine in 2007.  
3.3.3.  The helicopter had been  rebuilt in 2014 after a main rotor strike incident while with  another  
operator.  It had joined the operator's fleet  on 2 October 2014 , but  was not listed in the 
operator's current 'operations specifications ' (see paragraph 3. 6.7. 
3.3.4.  During the 2014 rebuild th e following additional components had been  replaced with new 
items:  
 the tail rotor drive shaft and bearings  
 the tail rotor bell crank  
 the left and right main rotor servos  
 the hydraulic pump bearing and drive belt, and large and small accumulators.  
3.3.5.  Since October  2014 the f ollowing components had been  replaced with new items:  
 the hydraulic filter  
 the main rotor blade spherical thrust bearing bolts  
 the tail rotor assembly  
 the starter -generator.  
3.3.6.  The maintenance records  showed  that the helicopter had been  maintained in accordance with 
the approved maintenance manual.  At the time of the accident the helicopter had a non -
terminating airworthiness certificate and a current maintenance 'Release to service'.  The

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 most recent  maintenance had been  completed on 12  November 2015 and inclu ded a 
combin ation  100/150/600 -hour  inspection of the airframe.  The main rotor blades had been  
replaced at that time with a part -life set.  
3.3.7.  The helicopter was not equipped for flight in instrument meteorological conditions.7 
Engine  
3.3.8.  The engine had operated for 7,492 hours before it was installed in the helicopter on 27 
September 2014.  The previous engine mai ntenance had been  a 150/300/600 -hour  
inspection completed on 12 November 2015.  The engine had accrued 8 ,109 hours as at 19 
Nove mber 2015.  
3.3.9.  The flight manual supplements for  the installed Honeywell LTS101 -600A -3A engine and the 
air inlet barrier filter contained no restriction against  flight in falling snow.  
Flight controls  
3.3.10.  The main rotor flight controls comprise d a traditional cycl ic stick8 and a collective lever9 for the 
pilot seated in the right seat only.  
3.3.11.  The flight controls were  hydraulically assisted, with three servos for the main rotor and one for 
the tail rotor pitch control.  A hydraulic  pump driven off the engine -to-transm ission drive shaft  
provided hydraulic pressure to these servos  and stored pressure in accumulators .  In the 
event of hydraulic pressure failure the accumulator pressure would be available, but when 
that pressure diminished the servos would lock hydraulically.  A pilot could  control the 
helicopter without hydraulic assistance, but greater  control forces were  required.  
3.3.12.  The tail rotor hydraulic servo was due for overhaul at 13,741 airframe hours.  On 24 April 
2015 the contracte d maintenance organisation had extended the servo replacement to 
13,921 hours , as allowed by  the Civil Aviation Rules10 and the approved maintenance 
programme .  The servo had remained in service for 38 hours beyond th is maximum limit . 
3.3.13.  The helicopter had acc rued 13,959 flight hours as at 19 November 2015.  
Weight and balance  
3.3.14.  The helicopter had last been  weighed on 19 September 2014.  The empty weight was 1 ,320.5 
kilograms (kg) . 
3.3.15.  The operator's exposition11 permitted the use of a standard passenger weight of 77 kg and 
standard loading plans for managing  the weight and balance  of its flights .  The passengers 
were not weighed before the flight  and no load sheet was prepared , which was permitted at 
the time (bu t see paragraph 4.3.18) .  The ground staff allocate d two passengers  of lighter 
stature  to sit in the dual front seat, which had a 154 kg weight limit at that time.  
                                                        
7 In effect, flight without visual reference to terrain.  
8 A cyclic stick is a  pilot's control that changes the pitch angle of a helicopter's main rotor blades at the same 
point of their rotation cycle.  The  rotor disc will tilt in the direction that the pilot has put the cyclic stick and 
the helicopter will move in the same direction . 
9 A collective lever is a  pilot's control that changes the pitch angle of a helicopter's main  rotor blades by the 
same amount at the same time, which changes the total rotor thrust, usually to effect a climb or descent . 
10 Civil Aviation Rule 91.603(d) refers.  Generally, the maximum allowable extension is 10% of the time 
between overhauls for the component.

 3.3.16.  The helicopter departed the operator's base  with 170 kg (or 40%)12 of fuel on board .  The all-
up weight13 was estimated to have been 2 ,165 kg.  The maximum permissible  all-up weight 
was 2,100 kg . 
3.3.17.  Allowing six minutes to fly the 13 km up to Chancellor Shelf and a few minutes parked with the 
engine running, there would have been about 151 kg of fuel on board when the helicopter 
departed for the return flight.  The estimated all-up weight at the start of the return flight was 
2,147  kg.  The longitudinal centre of gr avity14 was 3.197 m aft of the datum15, which was 
within the  allowable range  for an all -up weight of 2,100 kg  (see Appendix 2).  
3.4. Tests and research  
The helicopter engine  
3.4.1.  The initial examination of the engine was performed in New Zealand with assistance from the 
engine manufacturer's New Zealand representative.  The engine had external damage  that 
was related to the impact only .  The compressor section could not be turned because of a dent 
on the top of the casing.  The power turbine (which drove the accessor y gearbox  and the 
rotors) turned freely and quietly.  
3.4.2.  The engine was sen t to the manufacturer's facility in the United States, then disassembled 
and inspected under the supervision of the Commission's investigator in charge.  The 
investigators from  the BEA  and Airbus Helicopters were present.  The manufacturer 's 
inspection rep ort concluded "that the type and degree of damage was indicative of rotation 
and operation at the time of impact with the terrain.  No pre -existing condition was identified 
that would have interfered with the operation of the engine ". 
3.4.3.  Honeywell  provided a  report on its inspection s and testing of the engine fuel governor, power 
turbine governor and other engine accessories.  Honeywell concluded that all components 
were accounted for and all of the items had been  functional.  
3.4.4.  There was insufficient  fuel in the wreckage to be tested .  The fuel had been obtained  from the 
operator's  facility at Fox Glacier.  None of the operator 's other helicopters  had experienced  a 
fuel problem . 
The s pline d coupling  
3.4.5.  The engine -to-main -gearbox spline d coupling transmit ted engine torque from the accessories 
gearbox to the main transmission.  The teeth on the coupling splines16 at the main gearbox 
end were smeared and showed signs of bluing.17  The coupling was sent to Airbus Helicopters 
for examination and  an assessment of the torque required to produce the observed damage.  
3.4.6.  The examination  by Airbus Helicopters concluded that:  
whatever the approach used to assess the torque (power) needed to generate 
such damage on the splines, the result indicates that this t orque is significant 
and only possible if the engine was producing power when this phenomenon 
occurred.18 
                                                        
12 The fuel quantity gauge show ed the fuel load as a  percentage of the total capacity of 540 litres . 
13 The all-up weight is the  total weight of an aircraft with fuel , crew  and payload on  board . 
14 The centre of gravity is the single point in a n object through which the weight (force of gravity) can be 
considered to act. 
15 A datum is a reference point or plane from which measurements are taken.  The datum for an aircraft's 
centre of gravity is typically a vertical plane on, or ahead of, the nose  of the aircraft . 
16 A spline is a  rectangular key fitting into grooves in the hub and shaft of a wheel, especially one formed 
integrally with the shaft , which allows movement of the wheel on the shaft . 
17 Bluing is a discolouration of metal that usually ind icates exposure to excessive heat.

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 3.4.7.  The BEA agreed with the conclusions of the Airbus Helicopters report and added that the wear 
on the coupling teeth was a consequence of misalignment that had been  caused during the 
impact when the engine was delivering torque . 
The h ydraulic servos  
3.4.8.  The three main rotor hydraulic servos and the tail rotor servo were taken to an authorised 
overhaul centre in Australia and functionally tested, disassembled a nd inspected under the 
supervision of Commission investigators.  
3.4.9.  The servos were assessed against the acceptance checks for newly overhauled servos.  None 
of the servos passed all test points, and most failed two or three points.19  All had high internal 
leak rates.  The overhaul centre commented that the tail rotor  servo performance and its 
condition were to be expected given that it was overdue for an overhaul.  
3.4.10.  The BEA noted that it was difficult to draw a conclusion from such results because the checks 
were for new or overhauled parts, not parts that were used or had been in an accident.  
3.5. Meteorological information  
3.5.1.  Civil Aviation Rule 91.301 prescribed t he general meteorological requirements  for flight s 
under visual flight rules.  For flights conducted less than 1,000 ft (305 m) above the terrain in 
the uncontrolled airspace of the Fox Glacier  valley, the rule could  be summarised as:  
 there must be a minimum visibility of 5,000 m, except a helicopter may be operated with a 
visibility of less than 5,000 m if it is manoeuvred at a speed that gives adequate 
opportunity to observe other traffic or any obstructions in order to avoid collisions  
 an aircraft must remain clear of cloud and be in sight of the surfac e. 
3.5.2.  Civil Aviation Rule 135.155 (c) stated the absolute minima for helicopter operations : 
(c) A pilot -in-command of a helicopter performing a VFR [visual flight rules] air 
transport  operation outside controlled airspace must fly in meteorological  
conditions — 
(1) of not less than a ceiling20 of 600 feet [183 m] [above ground level] and flight 
visibility of not less than 1500 metres…  
3.5.3.  MetService New Zealand produces  forecasts and reports for aviation purposes.  It receive s 
hourly weather reports from the Franz Josef  town , but not from the Fox Glacier  town .  This 
information is used to  produce a general forecast for the West Coast area, including these  
glacier s.21  The operator said its usual practice was to print the forecasts every day, but i t is 
not known whether the  pilot viewed th e forecast  for 21 November 2015.  MetService provided 
a post -accident analysis of the weather on the day of the accident (see Appendix 3). 
3.5.4.  Witnesses recalled heavy rain at the Fox Glacier town  early in the morning, easing from about 
0800.  However, the ground staff said a squall came through just after the helicopter  departed  
from the Fox Glacier base . 
3.5.5.  A number of webcams were located near the Fox Glacier town  and looked towards the Fox 
Glacier  valley.  They did not provide live feed s, but w ere updated every 15 minutes.  The 
images from some of the cameras could be viewed at the glacier guides ' office  located in the 
same building as the operator's office.  
                                                        
19 Many mechanical components, if tested part -way through their service lives, would be very unlikely to meet 
stringent post -overhaul acceptance checks.  
20 The ceiling is the height above the surface of the base of the lowest layer of cloud covering more than half 
the sky . 
21 The 'Windward' forecast area covers the coastal strip from Westport to south of Haast, bordered to the 
east by the Southern Alps.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 13 >>
 3.5.6.  Images from a camera near the operator's base  showed rain and low cloud in the Fox River 
valley at about the time the pilot decided to postpone the early flights, and that visual 
meteorological conditions likely prevailed when the scenic flight departed (see Figure 6). 
3.5.7.  The local aviation operators were members of a user group22 that conformed to a Department 
of Conservation requirement for aircraft to not fly below 3,000 ft (914 m) at the Fox Glacier 
terminal.23  The requirement  was for noise abatement, but this effectively  meant  that 3,000 ft 
was the minimum cloud ceiling for entering the valley for a scenic flight.  
3.5.8.  Two other  local  operators had delayed their flights with glacier guides until about 0930 and 
had cancelled early scenic flights.24  A number of pilots and guides on the glacier had noted 
that the height of the cloud ceiling fluctuated and was sometimes, from their point of view, 
around Chancellor Hut, which is below Chancellor Shelf.  Some recalled seeing bright patches 
through the cloud , but also that "flat light "25 conditions  were present. According to the glacier  
guides, the wind in the lower valley was insignificant for most of the morning.  
3.5.9.  Photographs  recovered from some passengers' cameras showed that on leaving the 
operator's base  there was light rain  and the sky was overcast  with patches of low cloud at the 
sides of the valley.  The visibility and cloud conditions at that time  appeared to be better than 
the minimum requirements for flight under visual flight rules (see Figure 7). 
3.5.10.  The photographs  showed h eavier rain was encountered higher up the valley.  Approa ching 
Chancellor Shelf there was low cloud just above with some cloud spilling down the mountain.   
The photographs showed that t he helicopter was landed facin g west (see Figure 8) .  This was 
confirmed later by the search pilot.  
  
                                                        
22 The group's code of practice standardised local operational procedures for safety and to observe 
environmental restrictions.  
23 Mount Cook and Westland User Group, Operators' Handbook, version 6, March 2013.  
24 Other operators later conducted flights in support of glacier hiking, but after the accident all tourist flying 
ceased.  
25 Flat light exists when the ambient light level is low, producing weak or no shadows.  Surface features lack 
texture and contrast and are difficult to distinguish

 3.5.11.  The passengers' photographs showed snow falling while the helicopter was parked on 
Chancellor S helf.  Initially the edge of the shelf was discernible, but other photographs show ed 
that within a few minutes there was no obvious distinction between the snow surface and the 
cloud.

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 3.5.12.  No photographs were found that had been  taken after the passengers boarded the helicopter 
for the return flight.  
3.5.13.  The operator's pilot who was flying at Franz Josef encountered falling snow in the upper Franz 
Josef Glacier valley (16 km to the north) at about the same time  that the helicopter was at 
Chancellor Shelf .  After  returning to Franz Josef  town  the sun came out , so that pilot  decided 
to make a second flight to pick up other climbers.  On th e return  flight the wind increased from 
the west and southwest and it started to snow again.  Shortly after that the ground staff 
requested the pilot to search for the overdue helicopter.  
3.5.14.  During the search the cloud at the Fox Glacier terminal was above the locally agreed minimum 
for scenic flights.  There were cloud patches at about 3,000 -3,500 f t (914 -1,000 m) in front of 
the glacier, but the ceiling  was above 6,000 f t (1,800 m) , as it had been at Franz Josef.  After 
passing the lower cloud, the search pilot  could see that the usual landing area on the western 
side of Chancellor Shelf was at the edge of a thick patch of cloud about 1,000 f t (305 m)  in 
depth .  The search pilot considered  that the weather that morning was too changeable to have 
landed and allowed  passengers to walk ab out, but conditions improved 10 -15 minutes later.  
3.6. The operator  
3.6.1.  The operator had been  established as a private company in 1986 .  The company operated 
without an appointed board.  A more detailed description of the company structure is provided 
below.  
3.6.2.  The operator had later  been  issued with a general aviation air operator certificate  under Civil 
Aviation Rule s Part 119 , Air Opera tor - Certification .  The CAA had most recently re-issued the 
certificate with effect from 1 December  2012 , following a full 'recertification' audit .  The 
operating requirements were given in Civil Aviation Rules Part 135, Air Operations - 
Helicopters and Small Aeroplanes.  
3.6.3.  The operator's main business  was scenic flights around the mountains and glaciers of the 
Westland Tai Poutini  and Aoraki/ Mount  Cook National Parks, and charter flights for people 
engaged in climb ing, hunt ing and fish ing.  The main base was at Franz Josef, with bases at Fox 
Glacier and three other locations.  
3.6.4.  In November 2015 the operator had a fleet of 13 helicopters  and employed nine full-time 
pilots , four part-time pilots and 24  ground staff . 
3.6.5.  The company was noted for employ ing low-experience pilots as ground staff for a year or more 
before they would begin tr aining for turbine helicopter operations in the mountainous 
environment .  The rationale  was to enable  new pilots to understand the nature of the business  
and local weather patterns before acting as pilot s-in-command .  Pilots spoken to who had 
been through this system co nsidered it to have been effective and valuable .  When seasonal 
demand was high, the company employed additional , experienced  pilots on short -term  
contracts.  
3.6.6.  The owner was the chief executive and the holder of the air operat or certificate.  The chief 
executive had been  issued with a commercial pilot licence (helicopter) in 1976  and primarily 
flew a Hughes H369 helicopter from his home base  in support of climber s and hunt ers. 
3.6.7.  'Operations specifications ' were  the conditions imposed by the Director of Civil Aviation on the 
air operator certificate, and include d any authorisations, limitations and procedures that 
form ed part of the certificate.  Among other items, the operations specifications identified 
each aircraft that the operator was permitted to use.  It also listed the ' senior persons ' who 
were approved by the Director  of Civil Aviation , and any pilot training ap provals.  The chief 
executive was the senior person responsible for all flight operations and supporting ground 
operations, a role identified in the operations specifications as the ' operations manager' . 
3.6.8.  The operations specifications that were current on 2 1 November 2015 had been  issued on 25 
March 2015.

 Operational  supervision   
3.6.9.  The chief executive  authorised flying tasks .  Day-to-day activities were managed by the Franz 
Josef office manager and a senior pilot who had been appointed  the 'training supervisor '.  
Operations at each base were also supervised by the 'lead pilot'26 at that base on the day. 
3.6.10.  The operator had a pilot categorisation scheme that defined the scope of a pilot's 
authorisation to conduct flights for which they had been trained and approved.27  Under the 
scheme, a newly hired pilot would usually have a C -category and fly under the direct 
supervision of a higher -category  pilot.  The new pilot would typically fly for another season 
before being considered for promotion to B -category.  B -category  pilots operated under the 
indirect supervision of a more senior  pilot.  A -category pilots  were senior pilots who  could 
operate unsupervised to any landing site and act as lead pilots.  
3.6.11.  The operator's training manual did not list any criteria for promotion to a higher category.  The 
chief executive said that a pilot could reach the A -category after "four to five years and 3,000  
to 4,000 hours' experience ".28  The chief executive approved changes to pilots' 
categorisations based on advice from the training sup ervisor and other senior pilots.  
3.6.12.  The chief executive  said that pilot meetings were held every two or three months  to discuss  
incidents, complaints, operational changes and the like.  The minutes of the meetings held 
since 2012  showed that the y had been held, on average, once every four months.  In 
September 2013 , after a com ment  by pilots,  it had been  decided  to hold  meetings every six 
weeks , but eight months had passed before the next meeting . 
3.6.13.  An internal quality report had been  submitted in June 2014  about an inexperienced pilot 
performing a high -level snow landing when conditions were not suitable .  The report had been  
discussed at the November 2014 pilot meeting, where a call was made to reintroduce "past 
protocols ".  One past protocol  was that, before each day's operations, junior pilots would talk 
to a senior pilot about flying conditions and where they should or should not land.  
3.6.14.  Senior pilots provided guidance at pilot meetings on seasonal flying hazards.  The pilot had 
attended the most recent meeting  on 8 November 2015 , less than two weeks before the 
accident , at which there was  a discuss ion on  the changeable spring weather, the hazards of 
bright light, flat light and blowing snow, and the need to be vigilant for cloud  forming . 
3.6.15.  The chief executive  and the training supervisor had attended most pilot meetings  since 2012 . 
Pilot training  programme  
3.6.16.  The operator's administration manual  included a statement that the chief executive  would 
"ensure that all staff are trained in and understand the Part 119/135 manual suite  relevant to 
their duties for their role ". 
3.6.17.  The goal of the operator's training programme was "to ensure that each of its crew members 
[was] trained and competent to perform their assigned duties ".29  However, as the operations 
specifications did not include an approval for the operator to conduct internal training or flight 
crew competency assessments , these requirements were met by contracting  two approved 
external training organisations.  
3.6.18.  The Civil Aviation Rule s required a  pilot who had not qualified and served on an aircraft 
operated under the authority of the operator's certificate , to complete initial training that was  
                                                        
26 A designated senior pilot who supervises daily operations.  A lead pilot is also responsible for assessing the 
suitability of weather for flying.  
27 The scheme was part of the operator's exposition and applied to this operator  and its pilots only.  It should 
not be confused with a flight instructor rating  (Categories A to E), which is a qualification issued by the CAA 
and attached to a pilot's licence.  
28 The training supervisor estimated the same time for a pilot initially hire d as ground staff.  
29 Operator's training manual, repeating Civil Aviation Rule 135.553.  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 conducted  in a structured manner  and in accordance with a n appropriate  syllabus.30  The 
content of the initial training could be varied for an individual pilot if the extent of and reasons 
for the variation were recorded and certified in the pilot's record of training.  
3.6.19.  The CAA-approved senior person who was responsible for the operator's crew trainin g and 
competency assessment s was identified in the company manuals and the operations 
specifications as the training manager .31  The operator's administration manual  included the 
following duties of the training manager:  
1. Responsible for the management of al l aspects regarding company's training 
in accordance with procedures specified in the Training section of this 
exposition.  
2. The TM [training manager]  is to liaise with the approved organisation carrying 
out the Flight Tests  as to ensure that activities pert inent to [company]  
operations are included in the  checks.  
3. To carry out Competency Assessment on company pilots whenever the need  
required . 
4. To monitor operational standards, supervise training and checking of flight 
crew.   
5. Responsible for liaising with company CEO and relevant Flight Examiners in  
regard to ensuring all necessary assessments of company aircrew are 
performed when required . 
3.6.20.  The scope of the t raining manager's responsibilities was further shown by the following  
clauses  taken from the training manual : 
The TM will provide each personnel with the skills and knowledge to achieve a 
high level of overall competency as required for regular flight crew competency 
assessments.  
Areas of weakness or lack of currency will be identified during super vision  of 
pilots by the TM.  
Training on company procedures and operations specifications will be  
undertaken by the TM using this manual.  
Type conversions onto new aircraft types will be undertaken by a company 
appointed and appropriately qualified flight i nstructor from the Part 141  
organisation or the TM or an approved Flight Instructor.  
The TM and pilot to sign the [pilot categorisation] form.  
Annually, approximately half way between competency assessments, or when 
considered appropriate, each pilot will be observed working by the TM.   This 
check is and need not necessarily be from within the aircraft.  
After each assessment carried out by the TM the pilot 's assessment details to  be 
updated on the pilot 's checklist . 
Following assessment, should the TM consi der the pilot under review requires  
additional training, arrangements shall be made . 
3.6.21.  The incumbent training manager had begun training for the operator in 200 4 and had been 
the training manager since 2008 .  The training manager described the operator's tra ining 
programme as being an informal plan for the training of pilots who were new to the company 
or inexperienced.  
3.6.22.  The training manager's  primary employment had been  with an overseas  helicopter  company  
on a month -on, month -off roster.32  During the month off the training manager would usually 
return to New Zealand and might conduct training or check flights for the operator or for other 
operators .  In April 2009 the training manager had taken  a full -time job with a nother  New 
Zealand company  and had later become training manager  for that company also .  The training 
                                                        
30 Civil Aviation Rule 135.565 refers.  
31 This is a different role and a different person from the previously mentioned training supervisor.  
32 An employment mode often ca lled 'touring'.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 19 >>
 manager described having been  uncomfortable being a senior person for two companies, and 
having had little contac t with the operator after  2012 . 
3.6.23.  The training manager said that the chief exe cutive  had always made training resources 
available, and th at when the training manager had been  actively involved with th e operator, 
there had been  no training issues raised by the CAA .  The training manager had last provided 
training for the operator in January 2012  and had not attended any pilot meeting since that 
year.  In October 2012 , during the operator's recertification  process,  the training manager had 
signed an application to re main the senior person  responsible for crew training and 
competency assessment s.  The training manager had not been informed promptly at the time 
of the operator's accidents in November 2012 and June 2015 (see paragraph 3. 6.35). 
3.6.24.  A CAA audit report in March  2011 had noted that the training manager might have to be 
replaced should another employment offer be taken up .33  According to the audit report, the 
chief executive  had acknowledged that need.  The audit team had also discussed the 
possibility of someone other than the chief executive  being operations manager, because the 
size and scope of the operation had increased.  The chief executive  had said that the 
operations manager position would be reviewed before the recertification due in 2012 .  The 
new certificate had been  issued without any changes to the senior persons.  
3.6.25.  The flight crew training requirements were detailed  in Civil Aviation Rule 135.553, which 
stated in part:  
(a) Each holder of an air operator certificate shall establish a trainin g programme 
to ensure that each of its crew members are trained and competent to perform 
their assigned duties.  
(b) Each holder of an air operator certificate shall ensure that each crew member 
is trained in accordance with the training programme contained  in the certificate 
holder's exposition.  
(c) The holder of an air operator certificate shall ensure that its training 
programme is controlled by the certificate holder . 
3.6.26.  In an advisory circular34 dated 12 August 2011, the CAA had set out a means of meeting t he 
minimum rule requirements.  It stated that  operators  flying in mountainous areas should  
include in their training programme s approved mountain flying training element s and provide 
each of their pilots with training according to their need s. The CAA advisory circular had noted 
that:  
Helicopter basic mountain flying training completed as part of [the commercial 
pilot licence] training is only intended to introduce the pilot to the basic 
techniques and principles of operating a helicopter throu gh or within 
mountainous terrain and is normally only conducted in benign weather 
conditions. Therefore, it is not necessarily sufficient to prepare a helicopter pilot 
to conduct all commercial operations in a mountainous environment.  
It is incumbent on th e operator to conduct appropriate structured theory and 
practical training and to provide additional experience as necessary to ensure the 
pilot has the level of knowledge, skill and experience required to safely conduct 
the type of mountain operations cov ered in the operator's exposition.  
3.6.27.  The operator did not have a specific mountain flying training programme.  The chief executive  
said that their understanding was that  the usual external flight examiner conducted mountain 
training in conjunction with  check  flights.  However, the usual flight examiner 's organisation 
also had no approved mountain flying training programme  at the time .  The CAA submitted 
that when the operator had been  recertificated in 2012 , there had been  no approved provider 
of a mountain f lying training course.  The operator had therefore been unable to achieve  the 
expectation that it would provide its pilots with a level of mountain flying training suited to its 
operating environment .

34 CAA Advisory Circular AC119 -3, revision 6, 12 August 2011.  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 3.6.28.  The minutes of the pilot meeting on 2 July 2015 , which the chief executive  and the training 
supervisor  had attended, noted (without any elaboration ) that the operator needed a more 
structured training programme and an updated training checklist.  
3.6.29.  The operator's p ilots had been reminded at pilot meetings in 2011 and 2012  of the 
requirement for five hours of supervised consolidation flights a fter obtaining new type 
rating s35, and  that each logbook entry for a supervised flight had to be certified by the 
supervising pilot.36  The reminder s followed a finding by the CAA at an audit  in 2011.  
Training supervisor  
3.6.30.  Although t he operations specifications  did not approv e internal pilot  training , the operator had 
for some years allowed the training supervisor to conduct training.  
3.6.31.  The training supervisor had begun flying helicopters in 2003 and been  hired by the operator 
as ground staff from about that time.  He had been a commercial  pilot on the West Coast 
since 2006 , obtain ing an AS350 rating in October 2009.  
3.6.32.  The training supervisor had been encouraged since late 2012  to obtain a Category D flight 
instructor rating in order to  assist with training.  The training supervisor  had been  issued with 
the rating in April 2013 , at which time they had had approximately 2,250 hours of total flying 
time, including 850 hou rs in the AS350 . 
3.6.33.  The chief executive  had informed the pilot meeting held in February 2013 of the appointment 
of the training supervisor.  However, minutes of management review meetings suggested that 
the appointment was not  confirmed until 13 May 2014.  The training supervisor's role was 
stated to be the oversight of  junior pilots  under the overall supervision of the training 
manager , but the role and duties were not shown in the operator's exposition until a revision 
prepared in November 2015 .37  The draft revision included the following duties for the trai ning 
supervisor:  
Responsible for the supervision of all aspects regarding company's training in  
accordance with procedures specified in the Training section of this exposition.  
To monitor opera tional standards, and liaise with the TM with regards to the  
supervision of training and checking of flight crew.  
3.6.34.  After the N ovember 2015  accident , the training supervisor s tated  that their  responsib ilities 
included  type rating training , role training  and pilot supervision .  The training supervisor's 
understanding was that having a Category D  flight instructor rating permitted them  to conduct  
that level of  training, although it was noted that CAA inspectors had given conflicting advice to 
the training super visor on whether th at training was permitted . 
3.6.35.  The training supervisor had not seen the training manager since mid -2013 .  When advice had 
been needed , the training supervisor had usually asked an external flight examiner or a senior 
pilot from  another operator.  
Other safety occurrences  
3.6.36.  In 1989 two passengers had died when one of the operator's helicopters crashed during a 
scenic flight over Fox Glacier.  The other two occupants had been  seriously injured.  The 
helicopter had been flown below th e minimum permitted height above ground.38 
3.6.37.  The operator had notified  six other accidents, of which three  involved injury .  The a ccidents 
during  the six years  before November 2015  were as follows : 
                                                        
35 A type rating is an  authorisation associated with a pilot's licence that states the pilot is qualified to fly a 
specific model of aircraft .

  in September 2009 a pilot of a Hughes 500 reported having  experienced an engine 
compressor stall when about to land on the Fox Glacier névé  (snow catchment area) .  
The pilot attempted to fly away but a landing skid caught in the snow.  The helicopter 
rolled over, causing minor injuries to two of the occupants .  The chief executive  
counselled the pilot . 
 in November 2012 a pilot of a n AS350BA  intending to land at Pioneer Hut above Fox 
Glacier overflew the usual landing area and lost ground reference and depth perception 
because of ground -level blowing snow.  A landing skid contacted the snow , causing the 
helicopter to roll over.  No -one was injured . 
 in June 2015 a Hughes H369 crashed on take -off from an alpine site above Poerua 
River  in Westland .  The pilot and a passenger w ere seriously injured.  The chief 
executive  suggested  to the Commission at the time that the pilot  had not realise d that  
the helicopter involved had a tail rotor type that had  less authority  than similar models .  
The CAA found that a landing skid had likely caught the ground during the tak e-off, but 
identified no training or organisational factors . 
3.6.38.  The pilots involved in t hese three alpine accidents had fewer than 900 total flying hours  each . 
3.6.39.  In the six years before November 2015, seven  'aviation -related concerns' had been  lodged 
with the CAA regarding the operational practices of t he operator or the chief executive . 
3.7. The pilot  
Prior to flying with the operator  
3.7.1.  The pilot had begun  helicopter flight training in 2008 and been  issued with a New Zealand 
commercial pilot licence in 2009.  The pi lot had obtained a type rating for the AS350 in April 
2010 and then worked as ground staff at the operator's Franz Josef office.  In 2011 the pilot 
had gone  overseas and flown  commercial ly in Robinson R44 and Bell 206 helicopters.  The 
pilot had returned t o New Zealand in late 2013, having accumulated 1,209 hours ' total flight 
time, and taken  a break from flying.  
3.7.2.  The pilot had not flown an AS350 helicopter since obtaining the type rating in 2010.  In August 
2014 the pilot had completed a biennial flight rev iew in an AS350 and had had an additional  
40 minute s of dual instruction  in emergency procedures and mountain flying.  
Flying with the operator  
3.7.3.  In September 2014 the operator  had hired the pilot as a summer -season pilot at the Franz 
Josef base.  The training supervisor had conducted the pilot's training with the operator.  The 
pilot had obtained a type rating in the Hughes H369, which was another helicopter type used 
by the operator, and passed an annual flight crew competency check on th at type . 
3.7.4.  On 23 September 2014 the pilot had flown a 20 -minute 'familiarisation' flight in an AS350 
with the training supervisor , and a further 4.15 hours over the next few days under the direct 
supervision39 of the training supervisor.  By then the pilot had  had 13 hours' experience on the 
AS350, of which 4.6 hours had been flown with the operator on air operations.  The operator 
had then authorised the pilot to perform pilot -in-command duties on the AS350 for glacier 
hiking flights only.  The Civil Aviation Rule s required a pilot of a single -engine aircraft to have a 
minimum of five hours of supervised experience in air operations before being designated 
pilot-in-command of any air operation conducted by the operator.40 
3.7.5.  On 7 November 2014 the training supervisor had conducted an initial route check of the pilot 
in an AS350.  The training supervisor said the pilot had accumulated 100 hours on the AS350 
                                                        
39 Direct supervision means having an authorised and qualified pilot occupying a crew seat in the helicopter 
to monitor the flight.  
40 Civil Aviation Rule 135.505 refers.  The required experience excludes time accrued during training for the 
type rating, the operator's initial or transition training, and the competency check required by Rule  135.607.  
The operator's training manual included the requirement.  

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 before the check, although that was not a documented requirement  of the operator , but the 
pilot's logbook showed 63  hours accrued on the AS350 by that date.  
3.7.6.  The training record noted that the 1.3 -hour initial route check  had focused on snow landings 
at all of the operator's landing sites and huts, and included discussions on flat light and 
blowing snow conditions.  The  pilot had been  approved for solo landings at Chancellor Shelf  
following that check flight .  The pilot had not log ged this flight .41 
3.7.7.  On 17 March 2015 the pilot had flown  a scenic flight in a Hughes H369.  The pilot had five 
hours of type experience, but did  not have the required five hours of supervised air operations 
on the type.  
3.7.8.  In April 2015 the pilot  had left the operator for a job overseas flying a different helicopter type.  
3.7.9.  On 7 October 2015 the pilot had returned to work for the operator and flown a nine -minute 
solo 're -familiarisation' flight in an AS350.  A flight crew competency check had been  
completed in the AS350 the next day.  The flight examiner had not certif ied the flight crew 
competency check in the pilot's logbook, as required, but comme nted later that the check 
flight had taken 50% more time than was usual because the pilot had been  given some 
training and then re -checked.  The check flight had included few snow landings b ecause  the 
training supervisor  had told the flight examiner that t he pilot w ould be given more mountain 
flying training later that month.  
3.7.10.  Additional training had taken  place on 23 October 2015.  Both pilots  had logged the flight as a 
'route check', but the pilot had not record ed that it was conducted by the training supe rvisor .  
The training form, which the pilot had not sign ed, stated that the 35 -minute flight had been  
"dual training to all landing sites Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers… discussion about flat light, 
snow conditions, weather ".  The form had also noted:  
[The p ilot] has improved greatly since completing full season.  Approved to all 
landing sites and hut sites.  Under supervision for any hut site landing . 
3.7.11.  No record was found of an initial categorisation of the pilot under the operator's pilot 
categorisation scheme  (see paragraph 3.6.9) .  A categorisation form, dated 24 October 2015 
and signed by the chief executive, showed that the pilot was an A -category pilot on the AS350 
and a B -category pilot on the Hughes H369.  Manuscript footnotes on the form added tha t the 
pilot had been checked on the AS350 by the training supervisor for the B -category on 7 
November 2014 (see paragraph 3. 7.5) and for the A -category on 23 October 2015.  There 
was no date shown for the check on the Hughes H369.  The pilot had not signed  this 
categorisation form.  
3.7.12.  The training supervisor had certified an entry in the pilot's logbook for a scenic flight in a 
Hughes H369 helicopter on 27 October 2015, and another Hughes H369 flight three days 
later.  The certification suggested the flights had been  supervised command practice.  
However, the training supervisor had not log ged the flights in their  own logbook.  
3.7.13.  The pilot had logged 29 hours ' flying in the 30 days prior to the accident, including one hour in 
the week before the accident.  Up unti l the day of the accident the pilot's logbook showed 
1,792 hours ' total flight time, which included 415 hours on the AS350, of which 406 hours 
had been flown with the operator.  
3.8. Regulatory surveillance  
Introduction  
3.8.1.  New Zealand 's aviation regulatory system is based on a life -cycle approach.42  Participants 
enter the system, operate within it, and ultimately exit.  Participants enter this system when 
they have met the minimum standards and have been  issued with the relevant aviation 
                                                        
41 Refer to Civil Aviation Rule 61.29, Pilot Logbooks - General Requirements, one of which is to record flight 
details  accurately.  
42 These introductory paragraphs are adapted from CAA Surve illance, www.caa.govt.nz/surveillance . 
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 23 >>
 documents , for example an air operator certificate or pilot licence.  While in the system, they 
must continue to comply with these standards and the conditions of their documents.  At 
intervals, their compliance with  standards is checked  by monitoring and inspection , and any 
corrective actions are identified.  Th ese activitie s form the CAA 's surveillance function . 
3.8.2.  The CAA note d that surveillance can only be a sample of the state of an aviation document 
holder 's compliance.  It does not replace a participant 's respons ibility to self-check their own 
compliance with legislative requirements, and their continued safe operation in accordance 
with the safety standards, practices and conditions attached to their aviation documents.  
3.8.3.  With regard to its surveillance methods, th e CAA noted that:  
Staff performing inspection and monitoring tasks are responsible for accurately 
assessing the state of compliance of industry participants, for reporting this 
objectively, and for ensuring the CAA is kept informed of changes in the 
circum stances of individual participants that might adversely affect compliance 
and safety.  
Staff may also provide support and advice to participants.  This is always directed 
at risk management and compliance with regulatory standards.  It is not 
consultancy. T he line between the two is a fine one, and staff must not give any 
advice that could be interpreted as usurping the participant 's internal decision -
making processes or responsibilities . 
Surveillance of the operator  
3.8.4.  The CAA's Helicopter and Agricultural Uni t was responsible for the certification and 
surveillance of approximately 100 commercial operators  of more than 200 helicopters  (CAA, 
2018, p. 11) .  The unit manager said that priority was given to certification activities .  
Surveillance primarily involved scheduled audits supplemented by spot checks.  The unit  had 
full-time positions for  six flight operations inspectors and six airworthiness inspectors. This 
unit had been the primary CAA contact with the operator.  
3.8.5.  The CAA' s Personnel and Flight Training Unit was responsible for the certification and 
oversight of operators that were approved to provide flight training, and individual pilots who 
held flight examiner ratings.  Since  2013  this unit's chief flight examiner h ad had increasing 
contact with the training supervisor  who w as work ing towards gaining a flight examiner rating . 
3.8.6.  A CAA risk assessment  prepared for an audit after the accident in 2012 noted potential risks 
in the areas of chief executive  oversight, pilot supe rvision and the effectiveness of the lead 
pilot (training supervisor ). 
3.8.7.  The cover letter sent to an operator before each audit state s that "senior persons and any 
personnel with responsibilities under your aviation certificate should be present at the entry  
meeting ".  The training manager had not attend ed any of the audits  between March 2011 and 
late 2015 , including the routine audit on 5 March 201543, the scope of which included , in 
part,  the "effectiveness of crew training and lead pilot in their roles " and that the "pilot training 
syllabus and programme reflects the company's operations ".  The auditors'  checklist for that 
audit had noted that no senior person interviews were planned .  The CAA later confirmed that 
it was left to an auditor's discretion on whether they require d a senior person to attend a  
routine  audit . 
3.8.8.  The CAA flight operations auditor tasked with the March 2015 audit  had completed an 
operator risk assessment that included the following notes to explain for their manager the 
recommended audit scope:  
 Crew training manager is touring month on/off . 
 Risk statement - with [the training manager] not being in country full time there 
is a risk that he is not fulfilling his Senior Person duties and responsibilities 
correctly.  This would cause [a] risk of ineffective training that  [could]  in turn lead 
to an incident or accident.  
                                                        
43 CAA audit 15/ROUG/18.  

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007  In the past there has been a company culture of poor airmanship… [The training 
supervisor] was appointed as lead pilot to solve these issues. There is a risk that 
[their ] appointment has had no effect on… culture.  This would continue to 
increase the risk of an accident/incident.  
 The following are generic potential safety risks within the air operations sector.  
As such they are being targeted as specific safety initiatives:  
o poor standard of training and competency assessment programme 
documentation…  
3.8.9.  Informal n otes made during the audit indicated that the auditors had determined  that there 
was a low risk of a poor company culture, and that the training situation was "good ".  The 
notes stated that the training supervisor had "made vast improvements " and that crew 
members were receiving "good practical recurrent training ".  No findings were  made at this 
audit.  
3.8.10.  The helicopter (ZK -HKU) had been  chosen at random and inspected during  the same audit.  
There was no evidence that the  auditors had realised  that the helicopter was not listed in the 
operations specifications.44 
3.8.11.  The CAA  had new concern s about  the operator's training  following the June 2015 accident .  
Inspectors  conducted a sp ot check in September and interviewed the chief executive  and the 
training supervisor .  The inspec tors' notes suggest ed that the training supervisor had in effect  
been acting as training manager .  They  noted that  the training supervisor had improved the 
operator's performance.  The CAA made no findings during the spot check . 
3.8.12.  An operator risk assessment prepared less than three weeks after the accident recorded, for 
the first time, that the training manager had little involvement with the operator  and that it 
appeared that the training supervisor was carrying out the duties of this role .  The risk  
assessment included a state ment  that the training situation posed a high risk of an 
accident/incident, but noted that the training supervisor had the requisit e skill and 
experience.  The assessment also recorded that there was "much debate " within the CAA 
about the exercise of Category D flight instructor privileges , because of different 
interpretations of some Civil Aviation Rules . 
3.8.13.  After the November 2015 acci dent CAA flight operations inspectors said that they had verbally 
directed the training supervisor, during the spot check in September  2015, to cease training  
immediately .  The training supervisor did not recall  receiving such a direction.  The CAA 
acknowledged that the inspectors had made no notes relating to that spot check until after 
the accident.  
3.8.14.  On 27 February 2016 the CAA wrote to the chief executive  to inform them  that the approved 
training manager had not fulfilled the senior person role for  four years and , the CAA 
understood, had been replaced by the training supervisor.  The letter stated that the CAA "had 
been led to believe " by the chief executive  that the training manager had been active in the 
role, and expressed dismay that the trainin g supervisor was acting as the training manager 
and conducting unauthorised training.  The CAA directed the operator to "immediately 
complete a full risk assessment " of operations and pilot training.  
3.8.15.  On 27 May 2016 the Director  of Civil Aviation suspended the operator's air operat or 
certificate .  The operator then surrendered the certificate and, at their request, the Director 
revoked it on 9 June  2016 . 
                                                        
44 The helicopter had been added to the fleet after the issue date of the operations specifications that were 
current at the time of the audit.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The widely accepted theory of accident causation looks beyond the action (or inaction) of 
individuals who are in control of vehicle s or activit ies when something goes wrong  (see 
Appendix 4).  There are often underlying conditions and systemic factors that have either 
influenced the action s of those individuals or not provide d adequ ate defences to prevent the 
accident s.  These types of accident are sometimes referred to as 'organisational accidents '.  
The following analysis of the accident suggests that this was one such case.  
4.1.2.  There were no witnesses to the accident and no survivors to retell events.  Not all of the 
helicopter wreckage could be recovered from the hazardous glacial environment and there 
were no on -board recorders to help piece together what went wrong.  
4.1.3.  The analysis looks firstly at what is known to have happened and th e various proximate 
factors that could have contributed to the helicopter striking  the terrain.  The analysis then 
looks at two systemic safety issues within the operational and regulatory environments that 
are considered to have been significant factors c ontributing to the accident:  
 the operator's system for training its pilots did not comply fully with the Civil Aviation 
Rules or the operator's operations specifications, and did not adequately prepare the 
pilot for the role and responsibilities required for flight operations that day  
 the operator  had been allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations  with 
little or no intervention from the C AA, in spite of the CAA having identif ied significant  
non-compliances with the operator's training system and managerial oversight.  
4.2. What happened?  
The impact with the glacier  
4.2.1.  There was no record ed evidence  of the flight path taken by the helicopter after departing 
Chancellor Shelf.  In good conditions pilots usually descended as soon as they were clear of 
the shelf and flew down the right side of the valley  as required by a local ly agreed  traffic rule .  
If visibility was poor th ey might  descen d at a reduced speed in order to maintain visual contact 
with the rock faces that provided good visual refe rence s on the right side .  The lower speed  
required l ow engine power.  
4.2.2.  The extensive destruction of the lower fuselage  and the lack of significant damage to the 
heavy  vibration assembly atop the main rotor drive shaft  indicated that the helicopter hit the 
ice in a  relatively level attitude  with a very high rate of descent .  Although the  front left cabin 
and lower vertical stabiliser appeared to have contacted the ice first, that damage was very 
likely a consequence of the uneven surface  where the helicopter struck  rather than an 
indication  of the helicopter 's true attitude  at impact .  The forward speed was also high, as 
shown by the landing skids having sheared and rotated backwards .  The  wreckage scatter  was 
constraine d by the many  ice mounds and walls.  
4.2.3.  That the helicopter struck the glacier with a high forward speed and high rate of descent is 
supported by the post-mortem examinations  of the occupants , which  determined that all had 
died from multiple, high -energy impac t injuries.  Although it could not be determined 
conclusively where each passenger was sitting for the return flight, it was confirmed that f our 
passengers were ejected from the helicopter during the impact sequence.  
4.2.4.  Indications were that the main rotor had low rotational energy when  it came to rest .  The 
leading edges of the blades  had no significant damage , and the y were  found straddling an ice 
mound, which suggested  that the rotor m ight not have been rotating when it fell into th at 
position . 
4.2.5.  The main r otor and the transmission , although  found on top of the helicopter , were not 
attached to the fuselage .  The main rotor head and blades exhibited damage indicative of 
severe downwards flapping, which w as a strong indication of  a very high rate of vertical 

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 impact.  It was as likely as not that the main rotor assembly and transmission separated from 
the fuselage in the initial impact, and that these large items 'flew ' together  until they hit the 
ice cliff.  Without any driving power behind them, t he revolution s per minute  of the main rotor 
blades would have rapidly decayed during  this brief period before  carving the few short, 
shallow arcs into the ice cliff face  that were noted during the site assessment .  This hypothesis 
could explain  why the main rotor blades were not  significant ly damage d. 
4.3. Factors that possibly contributed  to the crash  
4.3.1.  The following  possible scenarios  were considered reasonable for the  known circumstances , 
and are discussed below : 
 pilot incapacitation  
 a flight contro l problem  
 weight and balance  out of limits   
 an engine  problem  
 loss of visual cues  
 vortex ring state . 
Pilot incapacitation  
4.3.2.  The pilot had had three days off duty prior to 21 November 2015.  Witnesses said that the 
pilot's behaviour and demeanour on the day of the accident were normal and the pilot 
appeared fit to fly.  
4.3.3.  According to family and friends, the pilot lived an active and healthy lifestyle with no indication 
of any health issue.  On their most recent application for the issue of an aviation medical 
certificate, the pilot had not listed any  current medical concern  or noted that they had seen  a 
health professional or taken medication in the preceding three years.  A review of the pilot 's 
medical records revealed nothing that would suggest a medical issu e that could have affect ed 
their  performance.  
4.3.4.  The pilot's medical file held by the CAA raised  no medical concern.  On 16 October 2015 the 
pilot had been  issued with a Class one medical certificate with no attached conditions or 
restrictions.  
4.3.5.  The p ost-morte m examination of the pilot found no sign of any pre -existing condition that 
might have affected performance .  Toxicological analysis found no evidence of any 
performance -impairing substance.  
4.3.6.  In view of the above, it is unlikely that the pilot was medically  incapacitated during the flight or 
that their performance was impaired in any way.  
Flight control s  
4.3.7.  Because the forward section of the cabin could not be recovered, it was not possible to 
establish whether  there was  complete flight control continuity from the pilot's  controls to the 
main and tail rotors .  However, as discussed above it is about as likely as not that the 
helicopter struck the glacier while flying  straight and descending at a high rate . 
4.3.8.  If a pilot had had a collective  lever  control probl em after take -off, it might have been expected 
that they would turn the helicopter toward s the smoother snow to the side of the glacier rather 
than continu e towards the middle of the glacier.  If the pilot had had a  problem  with the cyclic  
stick  control, i t is unlikely that the helicopter would have struck the glacier in the level attitude 
that it did.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 27 >>
 4.3.9.  In post -accident testing, t hree of the four flight control servos failed internal leak checks, and 
all four failed static load tests .45  The combined leak rat es of all servos would have been about 
35 litres per hour, compared to  the hydraulic pump output of 600 litres per hour.  The 
overhaul company that performed the functional tests was of the view that the internal 
leakages should not have affected normal op eration.  Further, the test  procedure wa s for new 
or overhauled control servos.  The servos as tested were used, with one being overdue for 
overhaul.  Therefore the static load test results achieved w ere not considered unusual . 
4.3.10.  Servo transparency  is a flight control characteristic  that can occur when the in -flight loads on 
the main rotor exceed design limits and are fed back through the flight control servos.  A 
service letter issued by Eurocopter46 (the predecessor of Airbus Helicopters) noted th at servo 
transparency is affected by airspeed, collective pitch input, gross weight , 'G' (manoeuvring) 
loads and density altitude.47  An adverse combination of these factors c ould provoke servo 
transparency without any individual factor exceeding the flight m anual limitation.  
4.3.11.  The symptoms of servo transparency  are: 
 the flight controls become very heavy or stiff to move  
 an uncommanded right cyclic force, or an existing roll to the right, increases  
 the nose of the helicopter pitches up.  
The AS350 flight manual note d that these forces were  controllable, but they had to  be 
relieved  immediately .  If the  forces  were  not relieved , the helicopter 's natural  response  would 
reduce their severity within a few seconds.  
4.3.12.  Although servo transparency is not commonly encountered, it was considered a potential 
factor because the impact site and wreckage suggested  that the helicopter  had reached a 
high speed.  The gross weight and density altitude were also high . 
4.3.13.  The actual airspeed and the manoeuvring that preceded the impact are not known.  However, 
the training supervisor thought it unlikely that an AS350  would exceed 1 00 knots48 when  
descen ding from Chancellor S helf.49  The maximum permitted airspeed at 5,000 ft (1,500 m) 
was 140 knots.  Ordinarily it would be  unlikely for a  pilot to demand a high collective pitch 
during  a descent . 
4.3.14.  The BEA stated that poor servo condition could make servo transparency "more likely in some 
cases ", but said it was  not aware of any accident where the servo condition had been a 
contributing factor.  
4.3.15.  The helicopter might have achieved a sufficiently high airspeed during the descent that , in 
combination with an abrupt pull -up, a servo transparency event occurred .  Such a pull-up 
might have been necessary in an attempt to avoid striking the ice .  However, the wreckage did 
not indicate that the helicopter had been in a right roll at impact.  It was virtually certain that 
the pilot had not encountered a servo transparency event  in the descent  and been able to 
recover to a level attitude just as the helicopter hit the  ice. 
4.3.16.  All factors considered, it was unlikely that the helicopter encountered servo transparency.  
                                                        
45 A static load test involved applying hydraulic pressure to the servo unit and a static load on the output ram, 
to determine the load required to overload the servo and make the ram move.

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 Weight and balance  
4.3.17.  The all-up weight of the helicopter exceeded  the maximum allowable internal weight limit  
throughout the flight.  
4.3.18.  Pilots and operators have separate  responsib ilities for complying with the published 
limitations, includ ing weight and balance limits , for their aircraft .  Civil Aviation Rule 91.109 
states : 
No person shall operate an aircraft unless it is operated in compliance with the 
operating limitations specified in the aircraft flight manual.  
The operator's responsibility was covered  in Civil Aviation R ule 135.3 05, which stated in part : 
(a) A holder of an air operator certificate must ensure that — 
(1) the limitations contained in the aircraft flight manual, or other approved 
document, relating to the weight and balance of an aircraft are complied 
with; and  
(2) maximum allowable weights are not exceeded for zero fuel, manoeuvre, 
take-off, and landing; and  
(3) the aircraft's centre of gravity is within the limits referred to in paragraph 
(a)(1) at departure, and will remain within those limits throughout the air 
operation.  
4.3.19.  Operators are responsible for ensuring that the weights of passengers are established , and 
typically relieve pilots of that task.50  The operator used standard passenger weights and 
standard load plans  that did not  require, ordinarily, that th e actual weight and balance  be 
calculated  for a flight .  
4.3.20.  However, an advisory circular51 to the rule states that , "Information relating to the weight and 
balance of an aircraft needs to be made available to the pilot -in-command prior to 
commencement of the flight so that he or she can assess the safety of the proposed flight. It 
is the responsibility of t he operator to make this information available, and the pilot -in-
command's responsibility to use the information to satisfy himself/herself that each flight can 
be conducted safely. " 
4.3.21.  The advisory circular also states that , "There is no relief provided in t he rules for an aircraft to 
operate over weight when using standard passenger weights.  Rules also require air operators 
to adhere to the limitations set by the aircraft manufacturer.  When using a standard 
passenger weight from the rules, an operator is r equired to establish and comply with 
procedures that help identify those factors which may lead to the aircraft weight limitations 
being violated. " 
4.3.22.  The flight manual charts show ed that, at the calculated weight, the helicopter would have 
been close to the performance limit to achieve an out -of-ground -effect hover52 when it was at 
Chancellor Shelf.  There is no requirement to have out -of-ground -effect hover capability, but 
having a small performance margin can restrict the options available to a pilot for 
manoeuvring the helicopter at low speed.  
4.3.23.  The Commission has commented in other reports on the safety issue of operating an aircraft 
outside permissible limits , and in an earlier inquiry made the following finding in regard to 
using standard passenger weights and loading plans:

glossary.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 29 >>
 The use of standard loading configurations that use standard passenger weights 
should not be permitted when aircraft are fully loaded and operating close to 
permissible limits.53 
4.3.24.  On 27 November 2015 t he CAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive , which had been 
drafted before th is accident,  that operators calculat e the actual weight and balance before 
every flight of an AS350 with occupants or cargo on the dual front seat.54 
Engine  
4.3.25.  A detailed  engine inspection established that there were no pre -existing defects with the 
engine or its accessories that would have contributed to the accident, and that the engine was 
operating at the time the helicopter struck the glacier.  The wreckage review ( see Appendix 1) 
showed that the helicopter's main and tail rotors were rotating, although most likely under 
relatively low power, when the helicopter struck the glacier.  
4.3.26.  An examination of the engine output shaft carried out by Airbus Helicopters ( see paragra ph 
3.4.5) determined that the damaged splines were the consequence of a significant over-
torque  (above the maximum torque)  during the ground impact sequence . 
4.3.27.  If the helicopter had experienced a loss of engine power after departing Chancellor Shelf, 
there w ere smooth area s below Chancellor Shelf and further down the valley where the pilot 
might have  attempt ed an emergency landing .  Even i f no power was available, the pilot would 
have had c ontrol over the helicopter's forward speed and rate of descent , whereas the impact 
was at high speed . 
4.3.28.  The fuel control lever for the AS350 helicopter is located on the floor between the pilot and 
the dual front seat .  Incidents have been  caused by passenger s in the front centre seat 
inadvertently grabbing the fuel cont rol lever, or a bag or camera strap has caught the lever 
and shut off the fuel.  However, this helicopter was fitted with a shoulder -high barrier between 
the front centre seat and the pilot's seat to prevent this happening.  Although the forward 
fuselage w as not recovered,  the damage to the engine -transmission spline d coupling could 
not have occurred had the fuel been shut off.  
4.3.29.  The smearing of the engine -transmission output shaft splines, the sheared bolts on the 
forward flexible coupling, and evidence of r ubbing on the starter fan blade were good 
indications that the engine was driving the transmission (and therefore the rotors) when they 
both separated from the airframe.  
4.3.30.  Considering all of the above, it is very unlikely that any engine -related issue contri buted to the 
accident.  
Loss of vis ual cues  
4.3.31.  The helicopter was not equipped with the instruments necessary for safe flight in low o r no 
visibility , and the pilot was not trained for instrument fl ying.  Without the necessary training 
and instrumentation , a pilot who loses horizon references or visual contact with t errain  will 
very likely  becom e quickly disorientat ed and los e control  (International Helicopter Safety 
Team, 2018) .  In mountainous terrain, or if already at a low heig ht, a collision with the ground 
is virtually certain . 
4.3.32.  Three conditions were considered th at could lead to a pilot losing visual contact with  the 
glacier surface : 
 fogging or other obscuration of the windscreen  
 flying in cloud

<< Page 30 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007  loss of depth perception.  
4.3.33.  Winds creen fogging is a known problem , caused by  moist, warm air in the cabin com ing into 
contact with a colder windscreen.  A favourable condition for fogging is having passengers with 
wet clothes on board.  The fastest way to clear fogging is to vent the cabi n by open ing a 
window or to blow heated, demisting air across the windscreen.  
4.3.34.  The standard practice of the operator's pilots was to have the cabin heater on and to close the 
doors after passengers had disembarked for a snow landing.  As it was snowing , the pilot and 
passengers could have had damp clothes on when they got back on board.  
4.3.35.  As the forward section of t he helicopter was not recovered , it could not be determined whether 
the demister and heater had been in use.  
4.3.36.  Rain or snow on the windscreen also restricts  a pilot's view of the terrain ahead.  The chief 
executive  opined that any rain on the windscreen would not have disperse d until the airspeed 
was above 40 knots .  Rain and windscreen fogging together could severely limit a pilot's 
forward visibil ity. 
4.3.37.  It had been snowing while the passengers were outside on Chancellor Shelf, and from the 
photographs it could be seen that changeable cloud conditions existed in the area .  The actual 
conditions when the helicopter departed the landing site are not kno wn.  The pilot would have 
been  unlikely to take off if conditions of  reduced visibility were present in all directions.  The 
safe option would have been to remain parked until the weather improved.  
4.3.38.  It is very unlikely that the pilot would  have  intentionall y enter ed cloud  after take -off.  However, 
the weather was marginal and conditions were fluctuating  quickly . 
4.3.39.  Loss of depth perception can easily occur, particularly in flat light conditions or when visibility 
is restricted in some way.  Pilots could  use the  rock faces for reference after tak ing off from 
Chancellor S helf in flat light conditions . 
4.3.40.  Below Chancellor Shelf, a relatively smooth , snow -filled depression extended for some 
hundreds of metres  along the right edge of the glacier .  It is more difficult t o gauge one's 
distance from a smooth snow surface than it is from jagged ice like that of the glacier.  One 
local pilot said  that in  flat light conditions "you've got nothing to see; it 's all white ". 
4.3.41.  The first impact was on a relatively smooth mound of sno w-covered ice on the edge of the 
heavily crevassed part of the glacier.  If flat light conditions had been  present, and especially if 
the helicopter had been descending quickly, the pilot could have misjudge d the helicopter's 
height above the glacier and w hen to reduce the rate of descent.  
4.3.42.  None of the cameras recovered from the wreckage had recorded any images after the 
passengers re -boarded the helicopter , whereas passengers did photograph the departure 
from the operator's base  near the Fox Glacier town .  The absence of any further imagery after 
leaving Chancellor Shelf is unusual for tourists on a scenic flight.  It suggests that the visual 
conditions  might not have been  ideal  for photography . 
4.3.43.  Further information on the risk s associated with  flight in degraded visual environments is 
given in Appendix 5.  
Vortex ring state  
4.3.44.  Vortex ring state is the term given to a phenomenon where  the main rotor blade tip vortices, 
which are produced as a consequence of generating lift, remain attached to the bl ade tips.  
Vortex ring state  generally will not occur with an AS350 unless  the airspeed is low ( 20 knots  or 
less)  and the rate of descent  is 1,000 ft (305 m) per minute  or more .  When a helicopter is 
established in vortex ring state, an increase in power to reduce  the rate of descent or to 
attempt a climb will, instead, increase the downwash and caus e the helicopter to descend 
faster.  More information on vortex ring state is given in Appendix 6. 
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 31 >>
 4.3.45.  The substantial vertical crushing of the fuselage  at impact was the only evidence t hat might 
support  the possibility of the helicopter hav ing encountered vortex ring state.  As described 
above , the wreckage distribution indicated that the forward speed of the helicopter was 
almost certain  to have been  above 20 knot s.  Although Airbus Helicopters calculated that 
significant torque was present at impact , the relatively high forward speed was not consistent 
with the helicopter having been  in vortex ring state  at impact . 
4.3.46.  For the reasons discussed above, it is v irtually certain that the helicopter was not in vortex ring 
state w hen it crash ed. 
Summary of possible contributing factors  
4.3.47.  In the absence of other identifiable causative factors, i t is very likely that the helicopter struck 
the glacier due to the pilot lo sing awareness of the helicopter's height above the glacier until it 
was too late to avoid a collision. 
4.4. Organisational issues  
Safety issue: The operator's system for training its pilots did not comply  fully with the Civil 
Aviation Rules or the operator's operations specifications, and did not adequately prepare the 
pilot for the role and responsibilities required for flight operations that day.  
4.4.1.  Given that the pilot  had little more than one summer season of  operational experience in the 
alpine region , the Commission considered the operator's training system and how it prepared 
and assess ed a pilot  for increasing levels of responsibility.  
The decision to fly  and land on the glacier  
4.4.2.  Under Civil Aviation Rule 135.153, a  person performing an ai r operation under visual flight 
rules must use meteorological information of "sufficient reliability and accuracy provided from 
a source considered acceptable to the operator and the pilot".  This rule recognises the 
limitations of forecasting for places s uch as Fox Glacier where local conditions can differ from 
the area forecast and change rapidly.  Most of the West Coast is mountainous.  Operators and 
pilots rely heavily on the observed present weather when making operational decisions, 
especially for fli ghts expected to take less than 30 minutes.  
4.4.3.  The pilot was the only pilot flying for the operator at Fox Glacier that morning  and, being an A -
category pilot,  was authorised to decide whether a flight could take place.   That organisational 
responsibility was  in addition  to a personal responsibility as a pilot -in-command to ensure  that 
the weather was suitable for an intended flight.  T he operator's Franz Josef pilot was the  lead 
pilot that day, but only the pilot at Fox Glacier could properly assess the condi tions at Fox 
Glacier .  At 0700 the pilot judged that the weather was unsuitable for flying.  By 0830  the 
conditions were suitable  to fly the glacier guides to the lower landing site.  These were 
reasonable judgements  considering  that other operators at Fox  Glacier had made similar 
decisions . 
4.4.4.  The pilot decided to make the scenic flight only  after seeing the upper valley w hile flying the 
glacier guides to the lower landing site .  The pilot had acknowledged that the flight might have 
to be shortened if the wea ther up the glacier was poor or if a snow landing was not possible.  
4.4.5.  When the scenic flight departed the town , the weather conditions were above the minima for 
visual flight rules and better than the user group's minima.   However, some pilots who were 
operating to  the lower Fox Glacier landing sites and saw the helicopter proceeding up the 
valley told the Commission that they had been  surprised that the pilot made  the flight further 
up the valley in the changeable conditions.   Only one other operator commenced a  scenic 
flight that morning .  That flight departed the Fox Glacier town  at about 1115 but  because of 
low cloud  its pilot did not attempt to reach landing sites in the upper Fox and Franz Josef 
Glaciers . 
4.4.6.  The weather deteriorated as the helicopter  flew higher up  the glacier.  From passenger 
photographs and interviews with glacier guides and others who were located in the lower 

<< Page 32 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 valley at the time, conditions were marginal for visual flight rules up until the time the 
helicopter landed on Chancellor Shelf at about 0951.55  The training supervisor said that 
Chancellor Shelf was a good landing area in poor weather because there were plenty of terrain 
references and from there one could see what the weather was doing in the lower valley.  
4.4.7.  Passengers'  photo graphs taken wh en the helicopter was parked on the shelf  showed that  the 
visibility towards the glacier  was variable, with some cloud lower than the shelf.  The lower 
valley was partly visible in one view, which suggested a visibility greater than  the mini mum 
1,500 m required for visual flight rules.  In other directions the flat light allowed little or no 
distinction between the surface and the cloud.  
4.4.8.  If the conditions had been  below the visual flight rules minima  before take -off on the return 
flight , the pilot had the option of waiting for an improvement in the weather and radioing that 
decision to the Fox Glacier office .  Good radio communication was possible between 
Chancellor S helf and the Fox Glacier town , but nothing was heard at the office.  
4.4.9.  The de cision to con tinue with  the scenic flight and make the landing was imprudent  given the 
changeable conditions.  The pilot was considered by others to be very confident, but a  senior 
pilot commented that the pilot had at times shown a lack of awareness of how quickly the 
weather could  change.  Nevertheless, the pilot could have decided to  turn back at any time 
while proceeding up the valley . 
4.4.10.  The operator permitted its pilots to supplement their income s by taking photographs of 
passengers with camera s carried on board.  On this flight, each passenger group had their 
own camera.  Therefore it was unlikely that th e potential for additional income influenced the  
pilot's decision to land on Chancellor Shelf .  However, such a  practice should be carefully 
managed by operators so that pilots have no incentiv e to make  flights in marginal conditions.  
4.4.11.  At the time there was no  user group agreement that all operators would cease flying if one of 
them stopped because of poor weather.  The reaso n given was that  conditions could improve 
as rapidly as they could deteriorate , and the skill and experience of the pilots on duty would 
likely vary across the operators.  Three weeks after the accident, senior pilots from the 
different operators at Fox Gl acier agreed to advise each other when they thought  marginal 
weather conditions existed and that they would  treat any such assessment as though it were  
made by  one of their own senior pilots.  
Operator's  training system  
4.4.12.  The operator's training system was de scribed generally in its training manual, with more detail 
of the requirements shown in the associated forms.  The training manual stated that the 
training manager was the CAA -approved senior person responsible for the training system.  
The chief executive  retained custody of the training forms and, according to the training 
manual, was responsible for ensuring that training and checking forms were completed and 
filed correctly.  
4.4.13.  However, the training manager , whose  primary employment was with another company , had 
been absent  from the operation for nearly  four years .  The minutes of pilot meetings and 
training records showed that it was the training supervisor who had played the lead role in 
operational supervision a nd pilot management.   The training supervisor 's proposed duties  
(see paragraph 3.6. 31) closely matched th ose approved for the training manager  (see 
paragraph 3.6.18) .  
4.4.14.  The pilot had re-joined the operator in September 2014 with more than  1,200 hours' 
helic opter experience , but only 8.5 hours on the AS350 helicopter, accrued over five years.   
The chief executive  said new pilots usually started on the Hughes H369 , but  the pilot's 
experience on the Bell 206 had prepared him for the AS350 .  The training given to a pilot 
could differ from the programme specified in the operator's exposition as long as the reason 
                                                        
55 The times of arrival at and departure from Chancellor Shelf were determined from an analysis of 
photographs taken by passengers.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 33 >>
 for the variation was recorded.56  The operator had no specifi c training programme, so the 
various training decisions , which may have had a valid  basis , were not formally  record ed. 
4.4.15.  The training supervisor had recognised the pilot's low experience , both on the AS350 type and 
with flying in the mountains .  The training supervisor said the pilot was given the same training 
as other pilots an d had "a very controlled progression " through the pilot categorisation 
system , but  the training record s and logged flights  did not support that view . 
4.4.16.  There was no record found of the pilot having been initially categorised in the operator's pilot 
categorisation scheme, and only an informal record that showed the pilot had been  given a B -
category after two months with the operator , during which time the pil ot had flown  55 hours 
on the AS350.  
4.4.17.  The pilot had been  authorised by the operator to act as pilot -in-command on air operations in 
the AS350 before completing  the required five hours of supervised experience in air 
operations on that type.  The operator had also authorised the pilot  for scenic flying in the 
Hughes H369 helicopter before they accru ed any supervised consolidation , which was not in 
compliance with the C ivil Aviation Rules.  
4.4.18.  All pilots are examined to check th at th ey have the appropriate meteorol ogical knowledge for 
the level s of pilot licence they wish to hold, but theoretical knowledge must be complemented 
with practical training and experience.  An understanding of local weather patterns is essential 
for pilots employed in mountainous areas, an d it would usually take some years to acquire 
that understanding.   The pilot's decision to land on Chancellor Shelf under such changeable 
conditions  was not what would be expected by  a senior, unsupervised  pilot under the 
operator's categorisation scheme . 
4.4.19.  Air operators must provide training programme s to ensure that their  pilots are trained and 
competent to perform their assigned duties .57  The pilot 's training and work experience with 
the operator had been  gained in little more than one summer season .  The operator 's records 
show ed that the pilot had been  promoted to A -category only six weeks after re -joining the 
operator in 2015 . 
4.4.20.  The pilot's most recent  route check had been  on 23 October  2015 and lasted 35 minutes .  
The training supervisor had noted on the training record that  the flight w as "dual training  to all 
landing  sites Fox and Franz Glacier, all hut  sites ".  The pilot had not confirmed that the training 
had taken place by signing the operator's training form , and had not  logged th e correct details 
for the flight as required by the Civil Aviation Rules .58    A similarly described route check in 
2014 had taken 1.3 hours (see paragraph 3.7.6).  It is unlikely that effective training  and 
checking  took place at  all landing sites and hut sites  in 35 minutes , because it takes 12 
minutes or more just to fly to the head of one of the glacier s and back.   
4.4.21.  The standard of the pilot's operational performance  was unclear because of conflicting 
records provided by the operator.  The training supervisor had noted on the training record of 
the 23 October 2015 flight that the pilot was "approved to all landing sites and hut sites ", but 
had added "under supervision for any hut site landing ".  According to a pilot categorisation 
form s igned by the chief executive  on 24 October 2015 , the pilot was awarded  an A-category 
on the AS350 as a result of th at route check.   However, the operator's training manual stated 
that an A -category pilot was "able to work unsupervised ". 
4.4.22.  The pilot had not s igned th e most recent  categorisation form  to show  awareness of the 
awarded category and its associated responsibilities and privileges .  The o perator's

57 Civil Aviation Rule 135.553 refers.  
58 Civil A viation Rule 61.29 refers.  

<< Page 34 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 procedures  required pilots to sign the forms .59  The CAA had raised an audit finding in 2012 
for the same  omission  in regard to a nother pilot.60 
4.4.23.  The Civil Aviation Rules require d an operator  to "maintain accurate records of all required 
training undertaken by its crew members " and "all competency assessments and testing of its 
crew members ".61  Not all of the t raining records covering the pilot's training had been signed 
by the pilot to confirm that the details were correct.  The variances described above show that 
the operator had not complied with those requirements . 
4.4.24.  The operator's standard operating procedure s included five pages of 'Mountain flying notes', 
but did not  specif y what flight training  pilots had to undergo .  The  notes  acknowledge d that 
"Mountain flying techniques require special knowledge and no pilot employed by the Company 
is to fly the Company 's helicopters in mountainous areas unless approved by the Operations 
Manager ", and that "mountain flying approvals will only be given after the [operations 
manager is] satisfied that the pilot concerned has demonstrated [their] capability and 
knowledge and the pilot concerned is listed on the pilot categorisation form ".62 
4.4.25.  Some of the instruction given by the training supervisor to the pilot ( on snow landings , for 
example) would very likely have been  mountain flying training .  However, at the time there was 
no organisation or operator in New Zealand that had been  approved by the CAA to conduct  
mountain flying training  as described in Advisory Circular 119 -3 (see paragraph 3.6.21) .  
Consequently t he operator did not give the pilot any recognised mountain flying  training . 
4.4.26.  The speed with which the pilot was put through the operator's training program me and the 
fact that the training program me was not conducted in strict accordance with the Civil Aviation 
Rules are signal s that the operator's training system had not give n the pilot the training, 
experience and supervision commensurate with the level of responsibility the pilot was given  
as an A -category pilot  and necessary to mitigate the hazards of the area of operations.  
4.4.27.  Given the shortcomings in the operator's training system, the following section discusses the 
oversight of the operation by senior persons.  
Management oversight  
4.4.28.  Senior management in aviation companies  are responsible for giving effective oversight of 
compliance systems and processes.  However, the civil aviation rules and standards provide 
only a minimum or 'foundation' level of compliance.  Responsible management  operate s on a 
continuous improvement basis to exceed minimum standards and achieve good or even best 
industry practice.  In this case t he operator did not ac hieve compliance with those minimum 
standards  outlined in the civil aviation rules, particularly in respect of providing sufficient 
personnel to plan, perform and supervise its operations .  This is discussed further below.  
4.4.29.  The finding s made in CAA audits, the minutes of pilot meetings and the circumstances of the 
operator's three most recent accidents were indicators that the operator had not provided 
sufficient senior management oversight of  its operations  as required by  the Civil Aviation Rules 
and as described in its exposition . 
4.4.30.  Civil Aviation Rule  119.101, Personnel Requirements , stated:  
(a) An applicant for the grant of a general aviation air operator certificate must 
employ, contract, or otherwise engage —  
 (1)  a senior person identified as the chief executive who — 
(i) has the authority within the applicant's organisation to ensure that 
all activities undertaken by the organisation can be financed and 
carried out in accordance with the requirements and standards 
prescribed by th is Part; and

 (ii) is responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with the 
requirements of [Part 119]; and …  
(3)  sufficient personnel to plan, perform, supervise, inspect, and certify the 
operations listed in the applicant's exposition.  
4.4.31.  The chief executive  was closely involved with other aspects of the  business and, in effect, left 
the daily management of the Fox Glacier tourism operation to the office manager and the 
training supervisor .  However,  the office manager was not qualified to supervise operations . 
Their responsibility under the operator's exposition was for occurrence investigation s only.  
The November 2015 pilot meeting had noted, for the second time, that the chief executive 
was difficult to contact when advice was needed.  
4.4.32.  The Civil Aviation Rule  requirements for an air operator certificate recognised that a training 
manager was a key person, yet the approved individual had been absent for nearly four years.  
4.4.33.  The training manager had known  that a training supervisor had been ap pointed .  However, i t 
was not until June 2015, when asking for details of the Hughes H369  accident earlier that 
month,  that the training manager had learnt  that their senior person  appointment might have  
ceased .  The training manager had never been  formally advised by the chief executive of this 
change.  
4.4.34.  In spite of the training manager  no longer  having  an active involvement , the chief executive  
had not mention ed this situation, even during  the audit in Ma rch 2015 that  examined  pilot 
training .  In Ja nuary 2015 t he operator had request ed CAA approval to replace the training 
manager  with either the chief executive or the training supervisor , but the application  had 
been  declined . 
4.4.35.  The training supervisor, although well  intentioned, had conducted pilot training outside the 
approved operations specifications.  The pilot group had recorded a concern  about the lack of 
structure in th e operator's training system.63 
4.4.36.  Other i ssues that involved the control of maintenance (see paragraph  3.3.12)  and the control 
of aircraft weight and balance (paragraph 4.3.18) were  examples of the non -compliances that 
were  the subject of  findings in other CAA audits of the operator.  
4.4.37.  The operator 's internal audit programme  had not made  findings or identified 
corrective/preventive actions for the management and training issues referred to above.  
4.4.38.  CAA audit reports showed that the CAA had had indications as early as March 2011 about  the 
absence of the training manager , and was aware , at lea st from  2013, that the training 
supervisor  had effectively assumed the role .  However, the CAA had made no findings about 
these variations from the operations specifications . 
4.4.39.  CAA inspectors  informed the Commission that there had been  discuss ions with the operator 
and between  CAA staff regarding differ ent interpretations of the rules applying to the 
operator's training situation , and whether the training supervisor was a suitable candidate for 
the training manager  position.   Some of the internal CA A discussions had been  recorded in 
email s between staff .  
4.4.40.  The requirements for pilot instructors were stated in Civil Aviation Rule  135.567, which read:  
135.567 Flight crew member instructor qualifications  
Each holder of an air operator certificate shall e nsure that any person carrying out 
functions as an instructor in its flight crew member training programme established 
under this Part — 
(1) has satisfactorily completed the training required by this Subpart to serve as 
pilot-in-command in operations; and  
(2) holds a Category A, B, or D flight instructor rating; and  
                                                        
63 Minutes of pilot meeting held on 2 July 2015.  

<< Page 36 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 (3) completes initial and recurrent training requirements applicable to the instruction 
carried out.  
4.4.41.  The CAA did not clarify its interpretation of the instructor requirements until after the 
accident .64  The statement "its flight crew member training programme " in the above rule 
made it clear that instructor requirements had to be read in conjunction  with the applicable 
operations specification .  If the operator had had CAA approval to conduct internal flight 
training, then the training supervisor, who held a Category D flight instructor rating , might  also 
have been approved to conduct the training.  However, prior to the accident there had been  no 
CAA approv al for  internal training  against which the instructional competence of the training 
supervisor  could have been assessed . 
4.4.42.  The CAA had commented on, and in some cases raised findings for, aspects  of pilot training 
and competency checks after conducting audits of the operator  in 2005, 2008, 2011, 2013 
and Ma rch 2015.  CAA staff were aware that  the training supervisor had been conducting 
training, most likely since 2013, but they had made no specific finding of non -compliance 
during any audit between then and the accident in No vember 2015.  
4.4.43.  Following the accident, i n a letter to the operator in February 2016 , the CAA express ed 
extreme concern that the operator had "appointed an unapproved person to act as the 
training manager and also that unauthorised training ha s been conducted ".  The letter added 
that the  CAA had been "led to believe " by the  chief executive  at previous audits that the 
training manager had been acting in that senior person role .  However,  CAA auditors and 
inspectors had known  of the situation for some  years .  This issue is di scussed in the following 
section.  
4.5. CAA surveillance  
Safety issue: The operator  had been allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations 
with little or no intervention from the C AA, in spite of the CAA having identified significant non-
compliances with the operator's training system and managerial oversight . 
4.5.1.  The CAA auditors and inspectors had raised concern s at various audits since 2012 about the 
operator's management oversight and training system.  However, the CAA had not respond ed 
decisively to the in formation provided by  its surveillance  unit. 
4.5.2.  As previously discussed, t he CAA s urveillance s taff had had strong signals  for nearly four years 
leading up to the accident  that the training manager was likely to have had little  involve ment  
with the training  and checking of the operator's pilots .  The CAA staff  had known  the extent  of 
the training supervisor's internal training, and very likely had known  that the operator had no 
approval for this.  Some CAA surveillance staff admitted that th ere had been  some uncertaint y 
with interpreting the rul es but, in their view, t he training supervisor had raised the operator's 
standards.   Nevertheless, a n avoidable safety  risk existed because the operator's training 
system, including the use of  internal instructors, had not been formally assessed and 
approved  by the CAA .  
4.5.3.  Without  any formal finding s having been raised during any audits at which this situation was 
observed, the CAA had not been able to address the  continued non -compliance.  Inter nal CAA 
proce sses had not ensure d that higher -level CAA manage rs were  made fully aware of  the true 
situation .  Without the correct information, the managers  could not take the most appropriate  
action  necessary to get the operator  to comp ly with the requirements of its air operator 
certificate . 
4.5.4.  The training manager 's absence was not a  'change' to the list of approved senior person s, but 
the substitution with the training supervisor  was a variation to the organisational structure 
that the operator should  have advised to the CAA.  The relevant Civil Aviation Rule  stated:  
 
                                                        
64 See section 7.4.  The CAA further clarified the requirements by introducing the role of 'operational 
instructor' to subsequent approvals of operator operations specifications.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007

 119.165 Changes to certificate holder 's organisation  
(a) A holder of an air operator certificate must — (1) ensure that its exposition is 
amended so as to remain a current description of its organisation…  
4.5.5.  However, as mentioned in the previous section, the training and supervision of the pilot had 
not been of a sufficient standard for the level of responsibility the pilot was given.  This was a 
likely consequence of all the i ssues the auditors and CAA inspectors had identified over 
several years.  Good standards of pilot training and supervision are critical to safe operations.  
The CAA should have responded decisively to the observed and continuing  non-compliance in 
those are as. 
4.5.6.  The CAA website noted that improvements made in 2012 to its surveillance system had 
resulted in "an enhanced risk profiling process, and audits that are more focussed on the 
areas of higher risk within an organisation ". 
4.5.7.  The Commission had identified a safety issue in a previous inquiry65 where  the CAA regulatory 
tools had not been decisively used when dealing with an other  operator who had recurring 
audit findings in the areas of management and operatio ns.  On 26 February 2014 the 
Commission had recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation : 
that he apply stricter requirements upon holders of air operator certificates to 
take effective action  to correct identified deficiencies, and that any serious safety 
issues that are identified with managerial  oversight of airline operations always 
result in findings ( recommendation 001/14 ). 
4.5.8.  A similar recommendation could be a pplied in regard to the CAA 's surveillance of this 
operator .  CAA audits had identified , although not necessarily made findings  about, the 
following recurring areas of concern : 
 organisational leadership - setting example s, compliance with  the Civil Aviation Rules, 
the chief executive's view of audits  
 actions, required to correct audit findings, not completed by the agreed dates  
 senior person absence and accessibility  
 lack of transparency about absence of training manager . 
4.6. Sector risk profile  for operations conducted under Civil Aviation Rules Part 135  
4.6.1.  Since 2011 the accident rate in the New Zealand Part 135 aviation sector , which includes 
helicopters and small aeroplanes, had had an upward trend.  The underlying causes had not 
been immediately apparent.  In 2015 the CAA had commissioned an external project to 
examine the underlying influences on safety within the sector and  to present a risk profile of 
the sector. The goal had been  to assess the risks and to inform targeted and appropriate 
intervention s.  The CAA  published the first report on 'Part 135 Sector Risk Profile ' on 27 
November 2015  (Nav igatus Consulting, 2015) . 
4.6.2.  The sector risk profile was updated in June 2018.  More information is in Appendix 7. 
4.7. Summary  
4.7.1.  At the time of this accident the operator had one of the largest helicopter fleets in New 
Zealand.  There were a number of serious and persistent issues with the senior management 
oversight of the operation. Of particular relevance to this accident was management oversight 
of its pilot training system and the degree of supervision it provided for its pilots.  
4.7.2.  The operator carrie d the p rime responsibility for ensuring  that, as a minimum,  its operation 
was conducted in accordance with the Civil Aviation Rules and  its exposition.  The CAA ha d a 
                                                        
65 Inquiry AO -2011 -006, Britten -Norman BN.2A Mk.III -2, ZK -LGF, runway excursion , Pauanui Beach 
Aerodrome, 22 October 2011 . 

<< Page 38 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 responsibility to conduct effective surveillance of the operator as part of its monitoring 
compliance across the industry . 
4.7.3.  The CAA cannot reasonably be expected to ensure total compliance by all participants in the 
sector.  However, its surveillance activity  should ensure that where deficiencies are found they 
are formally recorded so that regul atory decisions  can be informed.  Appropriate  action can 
then be taken to either cause change or remove the threat from the system before an 
accident occur s. 
4.7.4.  In this case the CAA had had good cause and ample opportunities to intervene at an early 
stage.  I nstead the operator had been  allowed to continue , with little change to improve its 
training and management system , and little improvement in senior management oversight of 
the Fox Glacier operation .  That s ituation  had put the pilot in a position of respo nsibility that 
the pilot was not sufficiently trained or experienced for. 
4.7.5.  Ultimately the pilot had been  prematurely put in a position to make  operational decisions, 
unchecked.  Whatever happened a fter the helicopter lifted off from Chancellor Shelf, the 
accident was a culmination  of deficiencies in the system that put the pilot there on that day . 
4.7.6.  Since about 2010, in response to reviews and recommendations, the CAA has made  a number 
of changes with a fo cus on improving its performance of its regulatory role.  These changes  
have been  made  through the regulatory surveillance period  referred to in this report, and as 
such are relevant to its oversight of this operator  prior  to the accident .  The CAA refer red to 
some of these earlier changes  in its response to a previous recommendation made by  the 
Commission (refer to section 7of this report).  This work is an ongoing part of the CAA's 
'Regulatory Craft Programme' .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The helicopter struck the glacier surface with a high forward speed  and a high rate of descent , 
with the engine delivering power.  
5.2. Throughout t he flight, the all-up weight of the helicopter almost certainly exceeded  the 
maximum permitted weight.  
5.3. It is unlikely that mechanical failure with the helicopter was a factor in the accident.  Although 
not al l of the wreckage was r ecovered , an examination of the recovered components 
(including all the dynamic assemblies) revealed no pre-existing failure . 
5.4. The tail rotor servo had exceeded the maximum flight hours permitted before overhaul, 
although that was unlikely to have been a contributory factor.  
5.5. The weather conditions on the day were unstable and unsuitable  for conducting a scenic 
flight .  The localis ed weather conditions in the area were very likely to have been frequently 
below  the minimum criteria required by the Civil Aviation Rules . 
5.6. It is very likely that when the helicopter took off from Chancellor Shelf and descended down 
the valley the pilot's perception of the helicopter's height above  the terrain was affected by 
one or more of the following conditions:  
 cloud 
 precipitation  
 flat light condit ions 
 condensation on the helicopter 's front windscreen . 
5.7. The pilot had not been properly trained and did not have the appropriate level of experience  
expected under the operator's categorisation scheme to fulfil the role and responsibilities  
expected of a s enior (A -category) pilot in this type of operation . 
5.8. The operator's system for training its pilots was ill -defined and did not comply fully with the 
Civil Aviation Rules.  
5.9. The operator's training  system did not have sufficient oversight by the designated sen ior 
persons .  This was a factor that allowed the pilot to be assigned roles and responsibilities 
without  the proper  training and experience.  
5.10.  The Civil Aviation Authority had identified significant  and repetitive non-compliance issues with 
the operator's training system and manage rial oversight  that warranted  interven tion long 
before this accident occurred.

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 6. Safety issues  
6.1. The operator's system for training its pilots did not comply fully with the Civil Aviation Rules or 
the operator's approved operations specifications, and did not adequately prepare the pilot for 
the role and responsibilities required for flight operations that day.  
6.2. The operator had been  allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations with little or no 
intervention from the CAA, in spite of the CAA having identified significant non-compliances 
with the operator's training system and managerial oversight.

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. The CAA published an article , 'Heli[copter ] weather decision making ', in the March/April 2016 
issue of its Vector  aviation safety education magazine  that sought to emphasise the correct 
use of meteorological minima . 
7.3. On 27 May 2016 the Director of Civil Aviation suspended the operator's air operat or 
certificate, and on 9 June 2016 revoked the certificate.  The CAA later laid charges under the 
Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 against some senior persons of the company.  
7.4. On 18 July 2016 the CAA issued a letter to the chief executives of all Part  135 operators on 
the subject of pilot training programmes.  The letter outlined the history of using pilots with 
Category D flight instructor ratings to deliver operational instruction, and clarified the 
privileges of flight instructors operating within o r outside approved training programme s.  The 
letter also explained the training programme details that must be shown in an operator's 
operations specifications.  
7.5. On 3 August 2016 the CAA issued revision 9 to advisory circular 61 -18 to clarify the privileges  
and limitations of the Category D flight instructor rating.  This defined operational flight 
training as the theoretical and practical training required for a pilot to operate an aircraft 
safely on commercial operations in accordance with the competency r equirements defined in 
an operator's crew member training program me.  The circular stated that Part 135 operators 
should have an established operational flight crew training program me within which the 
Category D flight instructor may operate as an operatio nal instructor.  The CAA now requires 
approved operational instructors to be  identified  in operations specifications.  
7.6. In September 2016 the CAA issued a n air operator certificate to a new company  that took over 
from the former operator.  Although it had th e same owner, that person no longer held a 
senior person role .  The operations specifications included training approvals appropriate to 
the new company's activities.   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.7. None identified .

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 8. Recommendation s 
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, a recommendation  has been issued to the Director of Civil Aviation , with 
notice of the recommendation given to  the Secretary of Transport . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety , it is important that th is recommendation  is implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Previous recommendation   
8.3. During an inquiry into an earlier serious incident involving a runway  overrun by an aeroplane  at 
Pauanui Beach aerodrome66, the Commission had commented on the importance of taking 
action to correct recurring deficiencies to prevent their be coming  contributing factors in a later 
incident.  
8.4. The Pauanui incident  had drawn attention to recurring deficiencies with the aeroplane 
operator  that had been previously identified by CAA audits.  For various reasons corrective 
actions had been ineffective, with the result that some of these deficiencies had contributed 
to the runway overrun .  A delay in correcting identified def iciencies c an be a latent factor that 
contribut es to future incidents.  
8.5. Some of those earlier audits had also discussed serious safety issues with th at operator's 
management oversight and  the general culture of the company, but not all of th ose issues had 
resulted in audit findings.  
8.6. On 26 February 2014 the Commission had recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that 
they apply stricter requirements upon holders of air operator certificates to take effective 
action to correct identified deficiencies, and  that any serious safety issues identified with 
managerial oversight of airline operations always result ed in findings. (001/14)  
8.7. On 5 March 2014, the CAA  had replied in part:  
The Director accepts the Commission's recommendation and advises that effective 
action has already been taken to implement its intent.  In this respect, it is 
noteworthy that the focus of the Commission's investigation primarily related to 
events in late 2011 and early 2013.  Since that time the CAA has undergone 
considerable organizat ional change: a real focus of which has been to supplement 
its strong aviation technical expertise with an enhanced regulatory skill set.  To this 
end it has recently invested considerable time and effort in articulating and 
strengthening its regulatory ap proach.  This work started to take effect at about the 
same time as the Pauanui Beach runway overrun occurred and has subsequently 
both gained impetus and been consolidated.  Examples of this investment include:  
 significant changes to the CAA's existing Su rveillance Policy made in Sep 2011.  
Relevant to the second element of the Commission Recommendation, the 
following direction was introduced regarding the raising of findings: "When a 
document holder's performance falls below the required standard a findin g will 
be raised";  
 new 'CAA Use of Regulatory Tools' policy introduced on 23 Sep 2011.  The new 
policy was created to provide guidance to CAA staff about the use of regulatory 
tools in discharging their obligations;  
 new 'Regulatory Operating Model' adopted  and promulgated by the CAA on 17 
Feb 2012.  The new policy was created to sit above the 'CAA Use of Regulatory 
                                                        
66 Inquiry AO -2011 -006, Britten -Norman BN.2A Mk.III -2, ZK -LGF, runway excursion, Pauanui Beach 
aerodrome, 22 October 2011.  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 43 >>
 Tools ' policy and identify, at a high level, the overarching regulatory principles 
and approach the CAA adopts in discharging its obligations;  
 [a consultant] has been engaged to up skill regulatory staff on good regulatory 
practice and operational risk management (workshops held May 2013 and Feb 
2014).  All senior regulatory staff, and the majority of all regulatory staff, have 
attended one of the se seminars;  
 the addition of Operational Risk Management and Safety Management System 
skills to the competency framework for regulatory staff.  Development and the 
delivery of such training with the latest element of the training delivery 
commencing March 2012;  
 internal review processes for regulatory functions ensure compliance with proper 
process and identify learnings that can drive improvement;  
 review of the current risk profile 'triggers' for targeting oversight of any operator 
with action underway to move toward targeting of the upper quartile of the risk 
profile distribution (as opposed to utilizing fixed trigger 'scores' for this purpose); 
and 
 the introduction of a risk -based approach to regulation that focusses attention on 
the circumstances of a pa rticular case, the risks posed and the selection of the 
most appropriate regulatory intervention to provide the required risk mitigation.  
The efforts outlined above constitute a significant strengthening and sharpening of 
the CAA's regulatory focus in the time since the overrun at Pauanui.  While 
incremental improvement is always possible the CAA has invested considerably in 
providing its staff with the direction, guidance, skills and tools necessary for them to 
make sound, evidence -based de cisions in the p ublic interest.  
8.8. Based on the  CAA's stated  actions, the Commission had closed the recommendation on 24 
June 2015.  
New recommendation  
8.9. As noted above , the CAA said that it had put  in place changes in policy and training for its 
inspectors by February 2014 .  Leading up to  that date,  and afterwards , CAA inspectors had 
overlooked significant  non-compliances by th e operator of the helicopter at Fox Glacier and 
they had not raised findings  on matters of non-compliance  with Civil Aviation  rules.  
8.10.  In this case the CA A had had good cause and ample opportunities to intervene at an early 
stage.  Instead the operator was allowed to continue , with little change to improve its systems.  
Those system s put the pilot in a position of responsibility that the pilot was not sufficiently 
trained or experienced for . 
8.11.  The Commission is concerned that there could be a wider safety issue whereby other Part 135 
operators that were  in the civil aviation system duri ng the same period could have significant 
non-compliances  that have either not been identified or not been resolved . 
8.12.  On 21 February 2019  the Commission recommend ed that the Director of Civil Aviation  initiate 
an independent  review  of CAA surveilla nce repor ts and any findings  raised for Part 135 
operators since 201 4 to measure the effectiveness of the surveillance policies and 
procedures that the CAA  has put in  place , including the effectiveness of their implementation .  
If the independent review finds unidentified or unresolved safety issues with specific 
operators, it is recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation take the appropriate urgent  
action to resolve those issues . (002/19) 
On 11 March 2019, the Chief Executi ve of Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The CAA undertook its own investigation into this crash and subsequently 
successfully prosecuted the operator for not taking all practicable steps to ensure 
the safety of its pilot and his passengers. Participants in  the aviation system have a 
responsibility to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and this operator 
failed to do that.  

<< Page 44 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 The CAA investigation also identified that its safety oversight of this operator in the 
period leading up to the accident - particularly during the period 2010 -2012 - didn't 
meet its own standards. In summary, it lacked the rigour demanded by its policies 
and procedures.  
The analysis of those shortcomings was conducted in early 2017 and it was 
concluded that the work already un derway to improve the CAA's regulatory 
performance (the start of which is referred to by the Commission in its 
recommendation) was addressing the deficiencies observed in the dealings with this 
operator. Since initiating that work in mid -2013 the CAA has m ade significant 
changes to improve its regulatory performance and oversight of aviation system 
participants, and this work continues. Significant capability building initiatives have 
been implemented and further initiatives will continue to be progressed a s the CAA 
works to further enhance its performance and regulatory oversight. As a result of the 
work undertaken to date, and that currently in progress, the CAA of 2019 is a much 
more effective regulator than the one that was dealing with this operator in the 
period leading up to the 21 November 2015 crash.  
The CAA has already commenced implementation of the Commission's 
recommendation. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed to undertake the 
independent review, which will sample 200 inspection activities conducted over the 
period 1 January 2014 to 1 December 2018. At the time of writing, the PwC review 
was well advanced but was not yet complete. The work done to date has not 
identified any operators with significant non -compliances that have eit her not been 
identified or not been resolved. The independent review is expected to be completed 
by 31 March 2019 and the report will be made available to the Commission as soon 
as it is available.

 9. Key lessons  
9.1. Aircraft operators' senior management have a regulatory duty to maintain proper and effective 
oversight of their operation s.  Doing  otherwise will compromise the safety of the operation s 
and increase the risk of repeat accidents . 
9.2. Proper training of pilots is critical to the safety of air operations.  Any training  and competency  
system must ensure that pilots are trained and experienced to level s appropriate for their 
roles and responsibilities.  
9.3. Every operator must provide adequate supervision of its pilots, appropriate to the  pilots'  
exper ience  and training and the nature of the operation s. 
9.4. Aircraft manufacturers set 'never exceed' limitation s for good reason s.  Pilots should not , 
under any circumstances , load or operate their aircraft outside the limitation s. 
9.5. With knowledge comes respon sibility.  If a senior person working for an air operator or an 
inspector  working for the regulator identif ies a serious safety issue with an operation, the 
issue should be formally raised and action taken to  address it.

 Appendix 1:  Wreckage examination  
Between 27 January 2016 and 29 January 2016 the recovered wreckage, except for the engine67, was 
examined at the Commission's Wellington facility by the Commission's investigation team, the 
Accredited Representative of France , two other investigators from the BEA and an investigator from 
Airbus Helicopters.  
The following notes include observatio ns made by Airbus Helicopters during this examination.  
General  
The fuselage forward of the cabin bulkhead, including the flight controls and underfloor control linkages, 
was destroyed by high vertical and horizontal impact forces.  Most of the seats, doors  and exterior 
panels were detached.  The rear frame of the dual front seat was bent backwards to an angle of 
approximately 60 degrees.  The right (inside) frame of the seat and the back cushion from the top 
centre to the middle right were missing.  The pas senger seat belts attachments had pulled free of the 
structure.  
The left rear cabin structure had a substantial crease, made when the tail boom was still attached, but 
the tail boom had been subsequently torn off to the right.  
The landing gear cross tubes had sheared from the landing skids and rotated upwards, and the left 
landing gear shock absorber had been pulled from the structure.  
The pilot's instrument panel was recovered, but the instruments had been ejected and no useful 
information was obtained fro m them.   
Main rotor blades  
The three blades were connected to the rotor head.  There were no significant impact marks on the 
stainless steel leading edges or the blade tips.  The upper and lower surfaces of each blade had opened 
at the trailing edge, whic h was an indication  that drag loads had been imparted to the blades.  The 
broken spar on one blade showed a mix of upward flapping and drag loads.  One blade had lost much of 
the trailing edge, which was likely caused by impact with the ice late in the acc ident sequence.  
All of the observed damage was a consequence of overload during the accident.  No pre -existing 
damage was identified.  
Main rotor head  
The rotor head was connected to the main gearbox, but they were completely separated from the 
mechanical/ engine deck and displaced  rearwards.  The position indicated that they were disconnected 
from the airframe before falling there.  The rotor and swashplate turned freely when driven by the main 
gearbox input flange.  
Two of the three starflex® arms were brok en: one showing a 45O break that signifies a failure in drag, 
and the other evidence of flapping.  Damage to other rotor head components was consistent with their 
having experienced sudden stoppage drag loads.  
The drive and stationary scissors and all pitc h change rods were in good condition and operated 
correctly.  The vibration absorber that sits on top of the rotor drive shaft was largely undamaged.  
The droop restraining ring was significantly deformed by impact with the thrust fittings on each blade.  
This indicated substantial simultaneous main rotor blade flapping associated with a vertical impact.  
All of the observed damage resulted from the accident.  No pre -existing failure was observed.  
  
                                                        
67 The engine had been shipped to the manufacturer in the United States for examination.  

<< Page 48 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 Main gearbox, and engine to main gearbox coupling  
The gearbo x was connected to the rotor mast but the four transmission suspension bars were broken in 
overload.  The input flange was partially connected to the engine -transmission shaft by one of the 
flexible coupling bolts.  The other two bolts were missing, but th e lack of elongation of the flange holes 
indicated that they had failed in tensile overload.  No external or pre -existing damage was observed to 
the gearbox.  The magnetic plug was clean.  
The connecting casing, gimbal ring and coupling tube were connected to the engine, but they had 
disconnected from the gearbox because of overload failure of the connecting casing at the gearbox end.  
There was evidence of light rotational interference between the gimbal ring and the flexible coupling 
bolt heads at the gear box end, which most likely occurred when the connecting casing broke, and 
between the drive shaft and the coupling tube.  
The drive shaft was in good condition and connected to the flexible couplings at each end.  The engine 
end flexible coupling was connec ted to the engine shaft flange.  The splined shaft that connected the 
engine to the main transmission had moved rearwards.  The splines showed signs of smearing that 
would have required the shaft to have been driven by the engine, and therefore likely occu rred during 
the accident sequence.  The splined engine shaft was inspected during the engine tear -down in the 
United States, and then sent to France for furthe r examination ( see section 3.4  in the main report).  
Tail rotor drive shafts  
The tail rotor forward steel drive shaft, from the engine accessory gearbox, was seen at the crash site 
but was lost during the wreckage recovery.  As was the case for the accessory gearbox output to the 
main rotor, the gearbox output to the tail rotor was displaced rear ward and the retaining clip was 
missing.  
There was evidence of rotational interference between the flange of the light alloy section of the drive 
shaft and the hole in the engine compartment fire bulkhead through which the shaft passes.  That 
indicated that one or both  sides of the flange were mi ssing during the break up.  
The long drive shaft was visually not twisted.  It was still connected to the tail gearbox, and had little 
damage apart from the bearing  support being bent forward due to impact forces.  All six shaft support 
bearings turned free ly without binding.  The impact had caused grease to be ejected forward and down 
from the drive shaft bearings at a relative angle of 30 degrees68 (see Figure  10). 
Tail rotor assembly  
Both tail rotor blades had significant damage and the tail rotor gearbox output shaft was bent forward.  
The drive key between the tail rotor hub and the rotor shaft was not sheared , which indicated the blades 
were not being driven under high torque at impact and that flapping was the main mode of damage .  
The tail rotor gearbo x remained connected  to the tail boom and rear light alloy drive shaft, and did not 
exhibit any damage.  The gearbox turned freely and the magnetic chip detector was clean.  The pitch 
change operation was normal.  The blade tip 'fingers', which show whethe r the blades have contacted 
anything, were bent in a flapping direction and did not indicate significant rotation at impact.  
Flight controls  
Except for the tail rotor pitch controls (including the control servo on the upper tail boom) and the main 
rotor co ntrol servos, the main rotor and tail rotor control rods were destroyed and could not be 
recovered from the site.  The observed damage on available components was caused by overload 
resulting from the accident.  No pre -existing damage was observed.  
Hydraul ic servos  
The hydraulic system was severely damaged during the accident.  Examination of available components, 
including the hydraulic pump and the flight control servos, did not reveal any pre -impact damage.  
 
                                                        
68 This did not necessarily prove the helicopter's pitch attitude (compared to the horizontal) at impact.

 Fuel and other systems  
The fuel and electrical  systems could not be examined in detail because of the wreckage condition.  The 
fuel tank cradles had detached from the structure.  The fuel boost pumps from the base of the tank 
were not recovered.  
 
 
Figure 10 
Grease throw on tail rotor drive shaft  
Conclusions  
The examination was limited because of the significant damage and because not all of the wreckage 
could be recovered.  Those systems and assemblies that were examined did not allow any technical 
explanation for the accide nt.  All of the observed damage was a consequence of the accident.  
The Airbus Helicopters representative noted that while the damage to the main rotor blades was 
"generally representative of a lack of power " if the main  rotor blades had impacted the ground  while 
powered by the engine, the trailing edge damage to the blades was usually indicative of drag loads 
applied when the blades were under power.

 Appendix 3:  Weather analysis, 21 November 2015  
MetService provided the following post -accident analysis of the weather  on 21 November 2015 : 
On the morning of 21 November 2015 a broad trough of low pressure was moving 
slowly eastwards across New Zealand.  The north -eastern end of a weak warm front 
in the Tasman Sea, lying more or less parallel with the Fiordland coast, was moving 
slowly southeast towards the coast.  A moist westerly airstream flowed onto the west 
coast of the South Island.  
The West Coast area forecast for the period that included th e time of the accident 
predicted a westerly wind at about 15 knots at 3000 ft (923 m)70, increasing in 
strength at higher altitudes.  The freezing level was forecast to be at 6000 ft.  
Visibility was forecast to be about 20 km, reducing to 6 km in moderate rain 
showers.  Broken layers of cloud71 were predicted, with a base at 3000 ft (923 m) 
and tops at 10,000 ft.  
Recorded observations at Franz Josef, 16 km north NE of Fox Glacier town, showed 
that there had been a period of heavy rain between about 0200 and 0700 that 
morning.  Between 0700 and 0900 there was light to moderate rain, which ceased 
(at Franz Josef) before 0900.  The separation between the air temperature and dew 
point72 at Franz Josef indicated that cumulus cloud could have been expected with a 
base at about 1,200 ft in the heavy rain, and at about 3000 ft after the rain had 
ceased.  
 
  
                                                        
70 Heights in this section are above sea level.  
71 Broken means a layer covering between five and seven eighths of t he sky. 
72 Dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapo ur.  When 
further cooled, the vapo ur will condense to form liquid water , visible as cloud.

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 Appendix 4: James Reason Model of Accident Causation  
The 'Swiss Cheese' model of accident causation, originally proposed by James Reason, likens human 
system defence s to a series of slices of randomly -holed Swiss cheese arranged vertically and parallel to 
each other , with gaps between each slice.  
Reason hypothesi ses that most accidents can be traced to one or more of four levels of failure:  
 organisational influences  
 unsafe supervision  
 preconditions for unsafe acts  
 the unsafe acts themselves.  
In this model, an organisation's defences against the above potential failures are shown as a series of 
barriers, represented as slices of cheese.  The holes in the cheese slice s represent weaknesses in the 
individual parts of the system.  The potential weaknesses vary in size and position, and over time.  A 
system failure occurs when holes in each slice momentarily align, permitting "a trajectory of accident 
opportunity ".  A haz ard can then pass through all of the defences, leading to an accident.  
It is important to understand that the unsafe act, although depicted as a failure of the final barrier, is 
nearly always preceded by failures at other levels in the system.

 Appendix 5: Operations in a degraded visual environment  
Excerpts from European Helicopter Safety Team training leaflets  
Degraded visual environmen t 
A continuing significant number of accidents are due to pilot disorientation in a degraded visual  
environment.  Research has demonstrated the strong relationship between helicopter handling 
characteristics and available visual cues.  This has clearly shown that there are likely to be visual cueing 
conditions, helicopter handling characteristics and pilot capabilities which, although manageable 
individually, can be predicted to be unmanageable when in combination.  
 
Analysis indicates that any, or a comb ination of, the following three scenarios could result in a serious 
accident:  
a. Loss of control when attempting a manoeuvre to avoid a region of impaired visibility, i.e. 
backtracking, climbing above or descending below the degraded visual environment . 
b. Spatial disorientation or loss of control when transferring to instrument flight foll owing an 
advertent encounter with  instrument meteorological conditions . 
c. Loss of situational awareness resulting in controlled flight into terrain/sea/obstacles or a mid -air 
collision.  
 
1.1  Helicopter Handling Characteristics  
The inherent instability of the helicopter is a major factor in such accidents. For small un -stabilised 
helicopters, it is the pilot who has to provide the stability and he needs visual cues to do so.  
 
1.2  Pilot Capabilities  
Whilst most pilots receive limited basic training in 'flight with sole reference to instruments', the 
competence in this skill can deteriorate rapidly and therefore cannot always be relied upon to safely 
extricate the unprepared pi lot from an inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions  situation.  
 
1.3  Visual Cues  
Evidence shows that for a significant number of fatal accidents the primary causal factor was degraded 
visual cues. Common factors, which act to degrade the available  visual cues, include:  
a. Low levels of ambient light leading to a general reduction in the quality of the visual scene and 
the available optical cues, e.g. at dusk/night.  
b. Reduced visual range and/or loss of sight of the ground/surface of the sea due to the effects of 
fog or cloud.  
c. The presence of atmospheric haze or sun glare.  
d. A lack of surface texture or features such as buildings, roads and rivers, or lack of street lighting 
etc. when flying at night.  
e. A lack of texture on the surface of the sea/water, i.e.  calm water.  
f. Poorly delineated sloping or rising ground contours i.e. snowfields.  
g. Misleading cues such as a false horizon from, for example, a distant row of street/road lights.  
h. Obscuration due to precipitation or misting on the cockpit windows.  
 
1.4  Risk Analysis  
When planning a visual reference flight 'with the surface in sight', there are a number of obvious risk 
factors which should be taken into consideration prior to take -off: 
a. The aircraft is certificated for visual flight rules /visual meteorological  conditions  flight only.  
b. The pilot is not trained/current for instrument flight operations.  
c. The pilot is not trained/current in recoveries from unusual attitudes.  
d. The navigation will be by map and visual reference, perhaps with GPS backup.  
e. The flight is planned to take place at a height at which the surface cannot be clearly defined.  
f. A segment of the route involves over -flight of a rural, unpopulated area or large featureless 
areas such as water, snow etc.  
g. The flight is at night or in conditions of atmosp heric 'gloom'.  
h. Flight at night when there is no moon, or the stars and moon are obscured.  
i. There are, or are likely to be, significant layers of low level cloud en -route (4/8 - 8/8).  

<< Page 54 >>
 Final Report AO -2015 -007 j. The visibility is, or is likely to be, limited en -route, i.e. visual range  at or close to the minimum 
required for conducting a safe flight,(which may be significantly higher than the stated state 
minima).  
k. There is a significant probability of encountering mist/fog/haze en -route.  
l. There is a significant probability of encounterin g precipitation en -route.  
 
If these risk factors are considered as a risk assessment checklist, it can be seen that the magnitude of 
risk increases with the number of risks 'ticked'. For example:  
 If risks 1 to 4 were to be ticked, this would only pose a no rmal, acceptable level of risk provided 
that the flight were to be undertaken in good visual meteorological conditions . 
 If risks 1 to 9 are ticked, experience indicates that the flight should not be undertaken.  
 Risks 7 to 12 all add to the type of conditio ns that would make it extremely unlikely that a pilot 
would be able to maintain control of the aircraft's attitude by visual references alone.

 Appendix 6: Vortex ring state  
When a helicopter is generating rotor thrust or lift, there will be some recirculation of air around the end 
of the blades or rotor disc.73  The rec irculation is most pronounced at high power and low airspeed, as 
in a hover, and reduces as the helicopter moves forward.  Vortex ring state occurs when the tip vortex 
becomes more energised and a secondary inner vortex is established towards the centre of  the rotor 
disc because the rate of descent exceeds the induced downward flow (see Figures 11 and 12).

Vortex ring state  
(Courtesy of Federal Aviation Administration)  
The onset of vortex ring state can be sudden, resulting in the helicopter descending at a very high rate.  
Any increase in rotor thrust in an attempt to reduce the high rate of descent energi ses the vortices 
further and increases the rate of descent.  Rates of descent of more than 3,000 feet (914 m) per 
minute are not unusual.  A National Transportation Safety Board  report into an AS350 -B2 accident cited 
rates of descent between 4,000 feet (1220 m) and 6,000 feet (1829 m) per minute (National 
Transportation Safety Board, 2001).  This is significantly faster than the 1,500 to 2,000 feet (457 to 
610 m) per minute rate experienced in an autorotation following a total power loss.  
The conditions req uired for the formation of vortex ring state are very limited.  The helicopter needs to 
be under power to generate the downwash that initiates the tip vortices, and be descending in its own 
downwash to energise the vortices and help establish vortex ring s tate over the full disc.  The helicopter 
therefore ne eds to be slow and descending.  
Airspeeds of 10 knots (19 km  per hour ) or less and a rate of descent of more than 300 feet (90 m) per 
minute or more may be required to initiate vortex ring state.  A steep  downwind approach is often cited 
as a situation where power, low airspeed and a moderately high rate of descent can combine to create 
vortex ring state.  Flying in up -draughting air may reduce the rate of descent required to induce vortex 
ring state.  
To exit vortex ring state, the direction of the airflow through and around the rotor disc needs to be 
changed.  The traditional method has been to increase forward airspeed to move clear of the 
downwash, or to enter autorotation, which stops the air being acce lerated down through the disc.74  
Both actions result in a significant height loss .  All helicopter pilots are taught about vortex ring state 
and how to recover from it  during their training . 
 
                                                        
73 The 'rotor disc' is the area enclosed within the circle described by the rotor blade tips.  
74 Another  technique, the 'Vuichard Recovery', is now promoted.  This involves the use of cyclic to clear the 
downwash laterally .

 Final Report AO -2015 -007 Appendix 7:  Part 135 sector risk profile  
1. The CAA describes Sector Risk Profiles as follows (CAA, 2018) : 
A Sector Risk Profile is a way of examining the various underlying influences on 
safety within a given sector.  By breaking the overall risk into specific risk 
statements, attention can be focused onto specific problems.  For example, 
'reducing landing accidents' is more easily addressed than simply 'reducing 
accidents'.  
An important aspect of sector risk profiling is understanding that the participants 
within a sect or are well placed to evaluate the risks they face.  Accordingly the sector 
risk profiling method is based around capturing the knowledge, experience, and 
perceptions of as many participants as possible from within the sector.  The resulting 
mix of fact an d opinion is combined with evidential data, such as industry studies 
and demographics, and expressed as a set of risk statements that describe both the 
risk and the severity of its influence on safety.  
The ranking of risks in the sector of interest is wha t makes it a sector risk profile.  
Sector risk profiles help inform the CAA where to target its actions and resources. 
However, some areas of risk may be beyond the effective influence of the CAA. Some 
operational practices may carry risks that are highly d ependent upon the actions of 
individual participants, organisations, or industry groups.  
The greatest value of a sector risk profile is derived when participants read the 
statements, decide which ones apply to their organisation and then determine what 
they can do to minimise that risk.  
2. Without ignoring the diversity of factors in the helicopter and small aeroplanes sector of the 
industry  - such as operator size, location and activities - the project identified the following key 
risk themes:  
 training and pi lot experience  
 organisational environment and culture  
 sector safety culture and collaboration  
 institutional clients and their role in safety leadership  
 the regulator (CAA) and its practice.  
3. Brief, selected comments made for each theme included the followin g: 
 training  and pilot experience  
o the normal training pipeline does not in itself prepare pilots for Part 135 
operations.  Operators must have resources necessary to continue to develop 
pilots  
o some operators do not provide operational and recurrent training, or training in 
human factors and decision -making  
o there is a shortage of experienced instructors  
 organisational  environment and culture  
o experienced pilots feel younger pilots are not aware of, or don't communicate, 
their limitations.  
o some larger o perators have structures/cultures that hinder communication.  
o there is pressure to fly, especially in the peak season, which is a combination of  
commercial pressure, organisational culture and personal attitudes. However, in 
most cases pilots were not pres sured to fly in adverse weather.  
 sector safety culture  and collaboration  
o the influence of user groups is not fully utilised  
 regulator  and its practice  
Final Report AO -2015 -007 
<< Page 57 >>
 o there is a view that the CAA is overly focused on rule compliance and neglects 
operation, safety manageme nt and culture aspects  
o auditors lack operational  experience and are focused on box ticking  
o there  is inconsistency across auditors with too little feedback to operators.  
4. The report commented that "directly relevant to the cockpit and in -flight context and t he 
decisions made are the pilot's experience and attitude, the company culture and 
communication, and management 's focus on supporting pilots and developing the right 
attitude."
