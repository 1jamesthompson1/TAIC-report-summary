  \ theory of accident causation looks beyond the action (or inaction) of \nindividuals\
  \ who are in control of vehicle s or activit ies when something goes wrong  (see\
  \ \nAppendix 4).  There are often underlying conditions and systemic factors that\
  \ have either \ninfluenced the action s of those individuals or not provide d adequ\
  \ ate defences to prevent the \naccident s.  These types of accident are sometimes\
  \ referred to as 'organisational accidents '.  \nThe following analysis of the accident\
  \ suggests that this was one such case.  \n4.1.2.  There were no witnesses to the\
  \ accident and no survivors to retell events.  Not all of the \nhelicopter wreckage\
  \ could be recovered from the hazardous glacial environment and there \nwere no\
  \ on -board recorders to help piece together what went wrong.  \n4.1.3.  The analysis\
  \ looks firstly at what is known to have happened and th e various proximate \n\
  factors that could have contributed to the helicopter striking  the terrain.  The\
  \ analysis then \nlooks at two systemic safety issues within the operational and\
  \ regulatory environments that \nare considered to have been significant factors\
  \ c ontributing to the accident:  \n\uF0B7 the operator's system for training its\
  \ pilots did not comply fully with the Civil Aviation \nRules or the operator's\
  \ operations specifications, and did not adequately prepare the \npilot for the\
  \ role and responsibilities required for flight operations that day  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ operator  had been allowed to continue providing helicopter air operations  with\
  \ \nlittle or no intervention from the C AA, in spite of the CAA having identif\
  \ ied significant  \nnon-compliances with the operator's training system and managerial\
  \ oversight.  \n4.2. What happened?  \nThe impact with the glacier  \n4.2.1.  There\
  \ was no record ed evidence  of the flight path taken by the helicopter after departing\
  \ \nChancellor Shelf.  In good conditions pilots usually descended as soon as they\
  \ were clear of \nthe shelf and flew down the right side of the valley  as required\
  \ by a local ly agreed  traffic rule .  \nIf visibility was poor th ey might  descen\
  \ d at a reduced speed in order to maintain visual contact \nwith the rock faces\
  \ that provided good visual refe rence s on the right side .  The lower speed  \n\
  required l ow engine power.  \n4.2.2.  The extensive destruction of the lower fuselage\
  \  and the lack of significant damage to the \nheavy  vibration assembly atop the\
  \ main rotor drive shaft  indicated that the helicopter hit the \nice in a  relatively\
  \ level attitude  with a very high rate of descent .  Although the  front left cabin\
  \ \nand lower vertical stabiliser appeared to have contacted the ice first, that\
  \ damage was very \nlikely a consequence of the uneven surface  where the helicopter\
  \ struck  rather than an \nindication  of the helicopter 's true attitude  at impact\
  \ .  The forward speed was also high, as \nshown by the landing skids having sheared\
  \ and rotated backwards .  The  wreckage scatter  was \nconstraine d by the many\
  \  ice mounds and walls.  \n4.2.3.  That the helicopter struck the glacier with\
  \ a high forward speed and high rate of descent is \nsupported by the post-mortem\
  \ examinations  of the occupants , which  determined that all had \ndied from multiple,\
  \ high -energy impac t injuries.  Although it could not be determined \nconclusively\
  \ where each passenger was sitting for the return flight, it was confirmed that\
  \ f our \npassengers were ejected from the helicopter during the impact sequence.\
  \  \n4.2.4.  Indications were that the main rotor had low rotational energy when\
  \  it came to rest .  The \nleading edges of the blades  had no significant damage\
  \ , and the y were  found straddling an ice \nmound, which suggested  that the rotor\
  \ m ight not have been rotating when it fell into th at \nposition . \n4.2.5.  The\
  \ main r otor and the transmission , although  found on top of the helicopter ,\
  \ were not \nattached to the fuselage .  The main rotor head and blades exhibited\
  \ damage indicative of \nsevere downwards flapping, which w as a strong indication\
  \ of  a very high rate of vertical \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -007\
  \ impact.  It was as likely as not that the main rotor assembly and transmission\
  \ separated from \nthe fuselage in the initial impact, and that these large items\
  \ 'flew ' together  until they hit the \nice cliff.  Without any driving power behind\
  \ them, t he revolution s per minute  of the main rotor \nblades would have rapidly\
  \ decayed during  this brief period before  carving the few short, \nshallow arcs\
  \ into the ice cliff face  that were noted during the site assessment .  This hypothesis\
  \ \ncould explain  why the main rotor blades were not  significant ly damage d.\
  \ \n4.3. Factors that possibly contributed  to the crash  \n4.3.1.  The following\
  \  possible scenarios  were considered reasonable for the  known circumstances ,\
  \ \nand are discussed below : \n\uF0B7 pilot incapacitation  \n\uF0B7 a flight contro\
  \ l problem  \n\uF0B7 weight and balance  out of limits   \n\uF0B7 an engine  problem\
  \  \n\uF0B7 loss of visual cues  \n\uF0B7 vortex ring state . \nPilot incapacitation\
  \  \n4.3.2.  The pilot had had three days off duty prior to 21 November 2015.  Witnesses\
  \ said that the \npilot's behaviour and demeanour on the day of the accident were\
  \ normal and the pilot \nappeared fit to fly.  \n4.3.3.  According to family and\
  \ friends, the pilot lived an active and healthy lifestyle with no indication \n\
  of any health issue.  On their most recent application for the issue of an aviation\
  \ medical \ncertificate, the pilot had not listed any  current medical concern \
  \ or noted that they had seen  a \nhealth professional or taken medication in the\
  \ preceding three years.  A review of the pilot 's \nmedical records revealed nothing\
  \ that would suggest a medical issu e that could have affect ed \ntheir  performance.\
  \  \n4.3.4.  The pilot's medical file held by the CAA raised  no medical concern.\
  \  On 16 October 2015 the \npilot had been  issued with a Class one medical certificate\
  \ with no attached conditions or \nrestrictions.  \n4.3.5.  The p ost-morte m examination\
  \ of the pilot found no sign of any pre -existing condition that \nmight have affected\
  \ performance .  Toxicological analysis found no evidence of any \nperformance -impairing\
  \ substance.  \n4.3.6.  In view of the above, it is unlikely that the pilot was\
  \ medically  incapacitated during the flight or \nthat their performance was impaired\
  \ in any way.  \nFlight control s  \n4.3.7.  Because the forward section of the\
  \ cabin could not be recovered, it was not possible to \nestablish whether  there\
  \ was  complete flight control continuity from the pilot's  controls to the \nmain\
  \ and tail rotors .  However, as discussed above it is about as likely as not that\
  \ the \nhelicopter struck the glacier while flying  straight and descending at a\
  \ high rate . \n4.3.8.  If a pilot had had a collective  lever  control probl em\
  \ after take -off, it might have been expected \nthat they would turn the helicopter\
  \ toward s the smoother snow to the side of the glacier rather \nthan continu e\
  \ towards the middle of the glacier.  If the pilot had had a  problem  with the\
  \ cyclic  \nstick  control, i t is unlikely that the helicopter would have struck\
  \ the glacier in the level attitude \nthat it did.  \nFinal Report AO -2015 -007\
  \ \n<< Page 27 >>\n 4.3.9.  In post -accident testing, t hree of the four flight\
  \ control servos failed internal leak checks, and \nall four failed static load\
  \ tests .45  The combined leak rat es of all servos would have been about \n35 litres\
  \ per hour, compared to  the hydraulic pump output of 600 litres per hour.  The\
  \ \noverhaul company that performed the functional tests was of the view that the\
  \ internal \nleakages should not have affected normal op eration.  Further, the\
  \ test  procedure wa s for new \nor overhauled control servos.  The servos as tested\
  \ were used, with one being overdue for \noverhaul.  Therefore the static load test\
  \ results achieved w ere not considered unusual . \n4.3.10.  Servo transparency\
  \  is a flight control characteristic  that can occur when the in -flight loads\
  \ on \nthe main rotor exceed design limits and are fed back through the flight control\
  \ servos.  A \nservice letter issued by Eurocopter46 (the predecessor of Airbus\
  \ Helicopters) noted th at servo \ntransparency is affected by airspeed, collective\
  \ pitch input, gross weight , 'G' (manoeuvring) \nloads and density altitude.47\
  \  An adverse combination of these factors c ould provoke servo \ntransparency without\
  \ any individual factor exceeding the flight m anual limitation.  \n4.3.11.  The\
  \ symptoms of servo transparency  are: \n\uF0B7 the flight controls become very\
  \ heavy or stiff to move  \n\uF0B7 an uncommanded right cyclic force, or an existing\
  \ roll to the right, increases  \n\uF0B7 the nose of the helicopter pitches up.\
  \  \nThe AS350 flight manual note d that these forces were  controllable, but they\
  \ had to  be \nrelieved  immediately .  If the  forces  were  not relieved , the\
  \ helicopter 's natural  response  would \nreduce their severity within a few seconds.\
  \  \n4.3.12.  Although servo transparency is not commonly encountered, it was considered\
  \ a potential \nfactor because the impact site and wreckage suggested  that the\
  \ helicopter  had reached a \nhigh speed.  The gross weight and density altitude\
  \ were also high . \n4.3.13.  The actual airspeed and the manoeuvring that preceded\
  \ the impact are not known.  However, \nthe training supervisor thought it unlikely\
  \ that an AS350  would exceed 1 00 knots48 when  \ndescen ding from Chancellor S\
  \ helf.49  The maximum permitted airspeed at 5,000 ft (1,500 m) \nwas 140 knots.\
  \  Ordinarily it would be  unlikely for a  pilot to demand a high collective pitch\
  \ \nduring  a descent . \n4.3.14.  The BEA stated that poor servo condition could\
  \ make servo transparency \"more likely in some \ncases \", but said it was  not\
  \ aware of any accident where the servo condition had been a \ncontributing factor.\
  \  \n4.3.15.  The helicopter might have achieved a sufficiently high airspeed during\
  \ the descent that , in \ncombination with an abrupt pull -up, a servo transparency\
  \ event occurred .  Such a pull-up \nmight have been necessary in an attempt to\
  \ avoid striking the ice .  However, the wreckage did \nnot indicate that the helicopter\
  \ had been in a right roll at impact.  It was virtually certain that \nthe pilot\
  \ had not encountered a servo transparency event  in the descent  and been able\
  \ to \nrecover to a level attitude just as the helicopter hit the  ice. \n4.3.16.\
  \  All factors considered, it was unlikely that the helicopter encountered servo\
  \ transparency.  \n                                                        \n45\
  \ A static load test involved applying hydraulic pressure to the servo unit and\
  \ a static load on the output ram, \nto determine the load required to overload\
  \ the servo and make the ram move.  \n46 Service Letter No. 1648 -29-03, Hydraulic\
  \ power system: servo trans parency, 4 December 2003.  \n47 Density altitud e is\
  \ the 'pressure altitude ' corrected for any temperature difference from the temperature\
  \ at \nthat altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere . The pressure altitude\
  \ is the altitude in the \nInternational Stan dard Atmosphere with the same pressure\
  \ as the part of the atmosphere in question . \n48 A knot is a speed of one nautical\
  \ mile per hour, equivalent to 1.85 kilometres per hour . \n49 In part, because\
  \ of the additional drag from the ski basket.  \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2015 -007 Weight and balance  \n4.3.17.  The all-up weight of the helicopter\
  \ exceeded  the maximum allowable internal weight limit  \nthroughout the flight.\
  \  \n4.3.18.  Pilots and operators have separate  responsib ilities for complying\
  \ with the published \nlimitations, includ ing weight and balance limits , for their\
  \ aircraft .  Civil Aviation Rule 91.109 \nstates : \nNo person shall operate an\
  \ aircraft unless it is operated in compliance with the \noperating limitations\
  \ specified in the aircraft flight manual.  \nThe operator's responsibility was\
  \ covered  in Civil Aviation R ule 135.3 05, which stated in part : \n(a) A holder\
  \ of an air operator certificate must ensure that \u2014 \n(1) the limitations contained\
  \ in the aircraft flight manual, or other approved \ndocument, relating to the weight\
  \ and balance of an aircraft are complied \nwith; and  \n(2) maximum allowable weights\
  \ are not exceeded for zero fuel, manoeuvre, \ntake-off, and landing; and  \n(3)\
  \ the aircraft's centre of gravity is within the limits referred to in paragraph\
  \ \n(a)(1) at departure, and will remain within those limits throughout the air\
  \ \noperation.  \n4.3.19.  Operators are responsible for ensuring that the weights\
  \ of passengers are established , and \ntypically relieve pilots of that task.50\
  \  The operator used standard passenger weights and \nstandard load plans  that\
  \ did not  require, ordinarily, that th e actual weight and balance  be \ncalculated\
  \  for a flight .  \n4.3.20.  However, an advisory circular51 to the rule states\
  \ that , \"Information relating to the weight and \nbalance of an aircraft needs\
  \ to be made available to the pilot -in-command prior to \ncommencement of the flight\
  \ so that he or she can assess the safety of the proposed flight. It \nis the responsibility\
  \ of t he operator to make this information available, and the pilot -in-\ncommand's\
  \ responsibility to use the information to satisfy himself/herself that each flight\
  \ can \nbe conducted safely. \" \n4.3.21.  The advisory circular also states that\
  \ , \"There is no relief provided in t he rules for an aircraft to \noperate over\
  \ weight when using standard passenger weights.  Rules also require air operators\
  \ \nto adhere to the limitations set by the aircraft manufacturer.  When using a\
  \ standard \npassenger weight from the rules, an operator is r equired to establish\
  \ and comply with \nprocedures that help identify those factors which may lead to\
  \ the aircraft weight limitations \nbeing violated. \" \n4.3.22.  The flight manual\
  \ charts show ed that, at the calculated weight, the helicopter would have \nbeen\
  \ close to the performance limit to achieve an out -of-ground -effect hover52 when\
  \ it was at \nChancellor Shelf.  There is no requirement to have out -of-ground\
  \ -effect hover capability, but \nhaving a small performance margin can restrict\
  \ the options available to a pilot for \nmanoeuvring the helicopter at low speed.\
  \  \n4.3.23.  The Commission has commented in other reports on the safety issue\
  \ of operating an aircraft \noutside permissible limits , and in an earlier inquiry\
  \ made the following finding in regard to \nusing standard passenger weights and\
  \ loading plans:  \n                                                        \n50\
  \ Civil Aviation Ru le 135.303, refer.  \n51 Advisory circular AC119 -4, Passenger,\
  \ Crew and Baggage Weights.  \n52  A hover without the benefit of the rotor downwash\
  \ 'cushion' on the surface.  See 'ground effect' in the \nglossary.  \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 29 >>\n The use of standard loading configurations that\
  \ use standard passenger weights \nshould not be permitted when aircraft are fully\
  \ loaded and operating close to \npermissible limits.53 \n4.3.24.  On 27 November\
  \ 2015 t he CAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive , which had been \n\
  drafted before th is accident,  that operators calculat e the actual weight and\
  \ balance before \nevery flight of an AS350 with occupants or cargo on the dual\
  \ front seat.54 \nEngine  \n4.3.25.  A detailed  engine inspection established that\
  \ there were no pre -existing defects with the \nengine or its accessories that\
  \ would have contributed to the accident, and that the engine was \noperating at\
  \ the time the helicopter struck the glacier.  The wreckage review ( see Appendix\
  \ 1) \nshowed that the helicopter's main and tail rotors were rotating, although\
  \ most likely under \nrelatively low power, when the helicopter struck the glacier.\
  \  \n4.3.26.  An examination of the engine output shaft carried out by Airbus Helicopters\
  \ ( see paragra ph \n3.4.5) determined that the damaged splines were the consequence\
  \ of a significant over-\ntorque  (above the maximum torque)  during the ground\
  \ impact sequence . \n4.3.27.  If the helicopter had experienced a loss of engine\
  \ power after departing Chancellor Shelf, \nthere w ere smooth area s below Chancellor\
  \ Shelf and further down the valley where the pilot \nmight have  attempt ed an\
  \ emergency landing .  Even i f no power was available, the pilot would \nhave had\
  \ c ontrol over the helicopter's forward speed and rate of descent , whereas the\
  \ impact \nwas at high speed . \n4.3.28.  The fuel control lever for the AS350 helicopter\
  \ is located on the floor between the pilot and \nthe dual front seat .  Incidents\
  \ have been  caused by passenger s in the front centre seat \ninadvertently grabbing\
  \ the fuel cont rol lever, or a bag or camera strap has caught the lever \nand shut\
  \ off the fuel.  However, this helicopter was fitted with a shoulder -high barrier\
  \ between \nthe front centre seat and the pilot's seat to prevent this happening.\
  \  Although the forward \nfuselage w as not recovered,  the damage to the engine\
  \ -transmission spline d coupling could \nnot have occurred had the fuel been shut\
  \ off.  \n4.3.29.  The smearing of the engine -transmission output shaft splines,\
  \ the sheared bolts on the \nforward flexible coupling, and evidence of r ubbing\
  \ on the starter fan blade were good \nindications that the engine was driving the\
  \ transmission (and therefore the rotors) when they \nboth separated from the airframe.\
  \  \n4.3.30.  Considering all of the above, it is very unlikely that any engine\
  \ -related issue contri buted to the \naccident.  \nLoss of vis ual cues  \n4.3.31.\
  \  The helicopter was not equipped with the instruments necessary for safe flight\
  \ in low o r no \nvisibility , and the pilot was not trained for instrument fl ying.\
  \  Without the necessary training \nand instrumentation , a pilot who loses horizon\
  \ references or visual contact with t errain  will \nvery likely  becom e quickly\
  \ disorientat ed and los e control  (International Helicopter Safety \nTeam, 2018)\
  \ .  In mountainous terrain, or if already at a low heig ht, a collision with the\
  \ ground \nis virtually certain . \n4.3.32.  Three conditions were considered th\
  \ at could lead to a pilot losing visual contact with  the \nglacier surface : \n\
  \uF0B7 fogging or other obscuration of the windscreen  \n\uF0B7 flying in cloud\
  \  \n                                                        \n53 Report AO -2014\
  \ -005, Eurocopter AS350 -B2 (ZK -HYO), c ollision with terrain during heli -skiing\
  \ flight, Mount \nAlta, near Mount Aspiring National Park, 16 August 2014.  \n54\
  \ Airworthiness directive DCA/AS350/128, now at revision C, refers.  The directive\
  \ was in response to \nprevious occurrences involving AS350 helic opters equipped\
  \ with dual front seats.  \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -007 \uF0B7\
  \ loss of depth perception.  \n4.3.33.  Winds creen fogging is a known problem ,\
  \ caused by  moist, warm air in the cabin com ing into \ncontact with a colder windscreen.\
  \  A favourable condition for fogging is having passengers with \nwet clothes on\
  \ board.  The fastest way to clear fogging is to vent the cabi n by open ing a \n\
  window or to blow heated, demisting air across the windscreen.  \n4.3.34.  The standard\
  \ practice of the operator's pilots was to have the cabin heater on and to close\
  \ the \ndoors after passengers had disembarked for a snow landing.  As it was snowing\
  \ , the pilot and \npassengers could have had damp clothes on when they got back\
  \ on board.  \n4.3.35.  As the forward section of t he helicopter was not recovered\
  \ , it could not be determined whether \nthe demister and heater had been in use.\
  \  \n4.3.36.  Rain or snow on the windscreen also restricts  a pilot's view of the\
  \ terrain ahead.  The chief \nexecutive  opined that any rain on the windscreen\
  \ would not have disperse d until the airspeed \nwas above 40 knots .  Rain and\
  \ windscreen fogging together could severely limit a pilot's \nforward visibil ity.\
  \ \n4.3.37.  It had been snowing while the passengers were outside on Chancellor\
  \ Shelf, and from the \nphotographs it could be seen that changeable cloud conditions\
  \ existed in the area .  The actual \nconditions when the helicopter departed the\
  \ landing site are not kno wn.  The pilot would have \nbeen  unlikely to take off\
  \ if conditions of  reduced visibility were present in all directions.  The \nsafe\
  \ option would have been to remain parked until the weather improved.  \n4.3.38.\
  \  It is very unlikely that the pilot would  have  intentionall y enter ed cloud\
  \  after take -off.  However, \nthe weather was marginal and conditions were fluctuating\
  \  quickly . \n4.3.39.  Loss of depth perception can easily occur, particularly\
  \ in flat light conditions or when visibility \nis restricted in some way.  Pilots\
  \ could  use the  rock faces for reference after tak ing off from \nChancellor S\
  \ helf in flat light conditions . \n4.3.40.  Below Chancellor Shelf, a relatively\
  \ smooth , snow -filled depression extended for some \nhundreds of metres  along\
  \ the right edge of the glacier .  It is more difficult t o gauge one's \ndistance\
  \ from a smooth snow surface than it is from jagged ice like that of the glacier.\
  \  One \nlocal pilot said  that in  flat light conditions \"you've got nothing to\
  \ see; it 's all white \". \n4.3.41.  The first impact was on a relatively smooth\
  \ mound of sno w-covered ice on the edge of the \nheavily crevassed part of the\
  \ glacier.  If flat light conditions had been  present, and especially if \nthe\
  \ helicopter had been descending quickly, the pilot could have misjudge d the helicopter's\
  \ \nheight above the glacier and w hen to reduce the rate of descent.  \n4.3.42.\
  \  None of the cameras recovered from the wreckage had recorded any images after\
  \ the \npassengers re -boarded the helicopter , whereas passengers did photograph\
  \ the departure \nfrom the operator's base  near the Fox Glacier town .  The absence\
  \ of any further imagery after \nleaving Chancellor Shelf is unusual for tourists\
  \ on a scenic flight.  It suggests that the visual \nconditions  might not have\
  \ been  ideal  for photography . \n4.3.43.  Further information on the risk s associated\
  \ with  flight in degraded visual environments is \ngiven in Appendix 5.  \nVortex\
  \ ring state  \n4.3.44.  Vortex ring state is the term given to a phenomenon where\
  \  the main rotor blade tip vortices, \nwhich are produced as a consequence of generating\
  \ lift, remain attached to the bl ade tips.  \nVortex ring state  generally will\
  \ not occur with an AS350 unless  the airspeed is low ( 20 knots  or \nless)  and\
  \ the rate of descent  is 1,000 ft (305 m) per minute  or more .  When a helicopter\
  \ is \nestablished in vortex ring state, an increase in power to reduce  the rate\
  \ of descent or to \nattempt a climb will, instead, increase the downwash and caus\
  \ e the helicopter to descend \nfaster.  More information on vortex ring state is\
  \ given in Appendix 6. \nFinal Report AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 31 >>\n 4.3.45.  The\
  \ substantial vertical crushing of the fuselage  at impact was the only evidence\
  \ t hat might \nsupport  the possibility of the helicopter hav ing encountered vortex\
  \ ring state.  As described \nabove , the wreckage distribution indicated that the\
  \ forward speed of the helicopter was \nalmost certain  to have been  above 20 knot\
  \ s.  Although Airbus Helicopters calculated that \nsignificant torque was present\
  \ at impact , the relatively high forward speed was not consistent \nwith the helicopter\
  \ having been  in vortex ring state  at impact . \n4.3.46.  For the reasons discussed\
  \ above, it is v irtually certain that the helicopter was not in vortex ring \n\
  state w hen it crash ed. \nSummary of possible contributing factors  \n4.3.47. \
  \ In the absence of other identifiable causative factors, i t is very likely that\
  \ the helicopter struck \nthe glacier due to the pilot lo sing awareness of the\
  \ helicopter's height above the glacier until it \nwas too late to avoid a collision.\
  \ \n4.4. Organisational issues  \nSafety issue: The operator's system for training\
  \ its pilots did not comply  fully with the Civil \nAviation Rules or the operator's\
  \ operations specifications, and did not adequately prepare the \npilot for the\
  \ role and responsibilities required for flight operations that day.  \n4.4.1. \
  \ Given that the pilot  had little more than one summer season of  operational experience\
  \ in the \nalpine region , the Commission considered the operator's training system\
  \ and how it prepared \nand assess ed a pilot  for increasing levels of responsibility.\
  \  \nThe decision to fly  and land on the glacier  \n4.4.2.  Under Civil Aviation\
  \ Rule 135.153, a  person performing an ai r operation under visual flight \nrules\
  \ must use meteorological information of \"sufficient reliability and accuracy provided\
  \ from \na source considered acceptable to the operator and the pilot\".  This rule\
  \ recognises the \nlimitations of forecasting for places s uch as Fox Glacier where\
  \ local conditions can differ from \nthe area forecast and change rapidly.  Most\
  \ of the West Coast is mountainous.  Operators and \npilots rely heavily on the\
  \ observed present weather when making operational decisions, \nespecially for fli\
  \ ghts expected to take less than 30 minutes.  \n4.4.3.  The pilot was the only\
  \ pilot flying for the operator at Fox Glacier that morning  and, being an A -\n\
  category pilot,  was authorised to decide whether a flight could take place.   That\
  \ organisational \nresponsibility was  in addition  to a personal responsibility\
  \ as a pilot -in-command to ensure  that \nthe weather was suitable for an intended\
  \ flight.  T he operator's Franz Josef pilot was the  lead \npilot that day, but\
  \ only the pilot at Fox Glacier could properly assess the condi tions at Fox \n\
  Glacier .  At 0700 the pilot judged that the weather was unsuitable for flying.\
  \  By 0830  the \nconditions were suitable  to fly the glacier guides to the lower\
  \ landing site.  These were \nreasonable judgements  considering  that other operators\
  \ at Fox  Glacier had made similar \ndecisions . \n4.4.4.  The pilot decided to\
  \ make the scenic flight only  after seeing the upper valley w hile flying the \n\
  glacier guides to the lower landing site .  The pilot had acknowledged that the\
  \ flight might have \nto be shortened if the wea ther up the glacier was poor or\
  \ if a snow landing was not possible.  \n4.4.5.  When the scenic flight departed\
  \ the town , the weather conditions were above the minima for \nvisual flight rules\
  \ and better than the user group's minima.   However, some pilots who were \noperating\
  \ to  the lower Fox Glacier landing sites and saw the helicopter proceeding up the\
  \ \nvalley told the Commission that they had been  surprised that the pilot made\
  \  the flight further \nup the valley in the changeable conditions.   Only one other\
  \ operator commenced a  scenic \nflight that morning .  That flight departed the\
  \ Fox Glacier town  at about 1115 but  because of \nlow cloud  its pilot did not\
  \ attempt to reach landing sites in the upper Fox and Franz Josef \nGlaciers . \n\
  4.4.6.  The weather deteriorated as the helicopter  flew higher up  the glacier.\
  \  From passenger \nphotographs and interviews with glacier guides and others who\
  \ were located in the lower \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -007 valley\
  \ at the time, conditions were marginal for visual flight rules up until the time\
  \ the \nhelicopter landed on Chancellor Shelf at about 0951.55  The training supervisor\
  \ said that \nChancellor Shelf was a good landing area in poor weather because there\
  \ were plenty of terrain \nreferences and from there one could see what the weather\
  \ was doing in the lower valley.  \n4.4.7.  Passengers'  photo graphs taken wh en\
  \ the helicopter was parked on the shelf  showed that  the \nvisibility towards\
  \ the glacier  was variable, with some cloud lower than the shelf.  The lower \n\
  valley was partly visible in one view, which suggested a visibility greater than\
  \  the mini mum \n1,500 m required for visual flight rules.  In other directions\
  \ the flat light allowed little or no \ndistinction between the surface and the\
  \ cloud.  \n4.4.8.  If the conditions had been  below the visual flight rules minima\
  \  before take -off on the return \nflight , the pilot had the option of waiting\
  \ for an improvement in the weather and radioing that \ndecision to the Fox Glacier\
  \ office .  Good radio communication was possible between \nChancellor S helf and\
  \ the Fox Glacier town , but nothing was heard at the office.  \n4.4.9.  The de\
  \ cision to con tinue with  the scenic flight and make the landing was imprudent\
  \  given the \nchangeable conditions.  The pilot was considered by others to be\
  \ very confident, but a  senior \npilot commented that the pilot had at times shown\
  \ a lack of awareness of how quickly the \nweather could  change.  Nevertheless,\
  \ the pilot could have decided to  turn back at any time \nwhile proceeding up the\
  \ valley . \n4.4.10.  The operator permitted its pilots to supplement their income\
  \ s by taking photographs of \npassengers with camera s carried on board.  On this\
  \ flight, each passenger group had their \nown camera.  Therefore it was unlikely\
  \ that th e potential for additional income influenced the  \npilot's decision to\
  \ land on Chancellor Shelf .  However, such a  practice should be carefully \nmanaged\
  \ by operators so that pilots have no incentiv e to make  flights in marginal conditions.\
  \  \n4.4.11.  At the time there was no  user group agreement that all operators\
  \ would cease flying if one of \nthem stopped because of poor weather.  The reaso\
  \ n given was that  conditions could improve \nas rapidly as they could deteriorate\
  \ , and the skill and experience of the pilots on duty would \nlikely vary across\
  \ the operators.  Three weeks after the accident, senior pilots from the \ndifferent\
  \ operators at Fox Gl acier agreed to advise each other when they thought  marginal\
  \ \nweather conditions existed and that they would  treat any such assessment as\
  \ though it were  \nmade by  one of their own senior pilots.  \nOperator's  training\
  \ system  \n4.4.12.  The operator's training system was de scribed generally in\
  \ its training manual, with more detail \nof the requirements shown in the associated\
  \ forms.  The training manual stated that the \ntraining manager was the CAA -approved\
  \ senior person responsible for the training system.  \nThe chief executive  retained\
  \ custody of the training forms and, according to the training \nmanual, was responsible\
  \ for ensuring that training and checking forms were completed and \nfiled correctly.\
  \  \n4.4.13.  However, the training manager , whose  primary employment was with\
  \ another company , had \nbeen absent  from the operation for nearly  four years\
  \ .  The minutes of pilot meetings and \ntraining records showed that it was the\
  \ training supervisor who had played the lead role in \noperational supervision\
  \ a nd pilot management.   The training supervisor 's proposed duties  \n(see paragraph\
  \ 3.6. 31) closely matched th ose approved for the training manager  (see \nparagraph\
  \ 3.6.18) .  \n4.4.14.  The pilot had re-joined the operator in September 2014 with\
  \ more than  1,200 hours' \nhelic opter experience , but only 8.5 hours on the AS350\
  \ helicopter, accrued over five years.   \nThe chief executive  said new pilots\
  \ usually started on the Hughes H369 , but  the pilot's \nexperience on the Bell\
  \ 206 had prepared him for the AS350 .  The training given to a pilot \ncould differ\
  \ from the programme specified in the operator's exposition as long as the reason\
  \ \n                                                        \n55 The times of arrival\
  \ at and departure from Chancellor Shelf were determined from an analysis of \n\
  photographs taken by passengers.  \nFinal Report AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 33 >>\n\
  \ for the variation was recorded.56  The operator had no specifi c training programme,\
  \ so the \nvarious training decisions , which may have had a valid  basis , were\
  \ not formally  record ed. \n4.4.15.  The training supervisor had recognised the\
  \ pilot's low experience , both on the AS350 type and \nwith flying in the mountains\
  \ .  The training supervisor said the pilot was given the same training \nas other\
  \ pilots an d had \"a very controlled progression \" through the pilot categorisation\
  \ \nsystem , but  the training record s and logged flights  did not support that\
  \ view . \n4.4.16.  There was no record found of the pilot having been initially\
  \ categorised in the operator's pilot \ncategorisation scheme, and only an informal\
  \ record that showed the pilot had been  given a B -\ncategory after two months\
  \ with the operator , during which time the pil ot had flown  55 hours \non the\
  \ AS350.  \n4.4.17.  The pilot had been  authorised by the operator to act as pilot\
  \ -in-command on air operations in \nthe AS350 before completing  the required five\
  \ hours of supervised experience in air \noperations on that type.  The operator\
  \ had also authorised the pilot  for scenic flying in the \nHughes H369 helicopter\
  \ before they accru ed any supervised consolidation , which was not in \ncompliance\
  \ with the C ivil Aviation Rules.  \n4.4.18.  All pilots are examined to check th\
  \ at th ey have the appropriate meteorol ogical knowledge for \nthe level s of pilot\
  \ licence they wish to hold, but theoretical knowledge must be complemented \nwith\
  \ practical training and experience.  An understanding of local weather patterns\
  \ is essential \nfor pilots employed in mountainous areas, an d it would usually\
  \ take some years to acquire \nthat understanding.   The pilot's decision to land\
  \ on Chancellor Shelf under such changeable \nconditions  was not what would be\
  \ expected by  a senior, unsupervised  pilot under the \noperator's categorisation\
  \ scheme . \n4.4.19.  Air operators must provide training programme s to ensure\
  \ that their  pilots are trained and \ncompetent to perform their assigned duties\
  \ .57  The pilot 's training and work experience with \nthe operator had been  gained\
  \ in little more than one summer season .  The operator 's records \nshow ed that\
  \ the pilot had been  promoted to A -category only six weeks after re -joining the\
  \ \noperator in 2015 . \n4.4.20.  The pilot's most recent  route check had been\
  \  on 23 October  2015 and lasted 35 minutes .  \nThe training supervisor had noted\
  \ on the training record that  the flight w as \"dual training  to all \nlanding\
  \  sites Fox and Franz Glacier, all hut  sites \".  The pilot had not confirmed\
  \ that the training \nhad taken place by signing the operator's training form ,\
  \ and had not  logged th e correct details \nfor the flight as required by the Civil\
  \ Aviation Rules .58    A similarly described route check in \n2014 had taken 1.3\
  \ hours (see paragraph 3.7.6).  It is unlikely that effective training  and \nchecking\
  \  took place at  all landing sites and hut sites  in 35 minutes , because it takes\
  \ 12 \nminutes or more just to fly to the head of one of the glacier s and back.\
  \   \n4.4.21.  The standard of the pilot's operational performance  was unclear\
  \ because of conflicting \nrecords provided by the operator.  The training supervisor\
  \ had noted on the training record of \nthe 23 October 2015 flight that the pilot\
  \ was \"approved to all landing sites and hut sites \", but \nhad added \"under\
  \ supervision for any hut site landing \".  According to a pilot categorisation\
  \ \nform s igned by the chief executive  on 24 October 2015 , the pilot was awarded\
  \  an A-category \non the AS350 as a result of th at route check.   However, the\
  \ operator's training manual stated \nthat an A -category pilot was \"able to work\
  \ unsupervised \". \n4.4.22.  The pilot had not s igned th e most recent  categorisation\
  \ form  to show  awareness of the \nawarded category and its associated responsibilities\
  \ and privileges .  The o perator's \n                                         \
  \               \n56 Civil Aviation Rule 135.557 refers.  \n57 Civil Aviation Rule\
  \ 135.553 refers.  \n58 Civil A viation Rule 61.29 refers.  \n\n<< Page 34 >>\n\
  \ Final Report AO -2015 -007 procedures  required pilots to sign the forms .59 \
  \ The CAA had raised an audit finding in 2012 \nfor the same  omission  in regard\
  \ to a nother pilot.60 \n4.4.23.  The Civil Aviation Rules require d an operator\
  \  to \"maintain accurate records of all required \ntraining undertaken by its crew\
  \ members \" and \"all competency assessments and testing of its \ncrew members\
  \ \".61  Not all of the t raining records covering the pilot's training had been\
  \ signed \nby the pilot to confirm that the details were correct.  The variances\
  \ described above show that \nthe operator had not complied with those requirements\
  \ . \n4.4.24.  The operator's standard operating procedure s included five pages\
  \ of 'Mountain flying notes', \nbut did not  specif y what flight training  pilots\
  \ had to undergo .  The  notes  acknowledge d that \n\"Mountain flying techniques\
  \ require special knowledge and no pilot employed by the Company \nis to fly the\
  \ Company 's helicopters in mountainous areas unless approved by the Operations\
  \ \nManager \", and that \"mountain flying approvals will only be given after the\
  \ [operations \nmanager is] satisfied that the pilot concerned has demonstrated\
  \ [their] capability and \nknowledge and the pilot concerned is listed on the pilot\
  \ categorisation form \".62 \n4.4.25.  Some of the instruction given by the training\
  \ supervisor to the pilot ( on snow landings , for \nexample) would very likely\
  \ have been  mountain flying training .  However, at the time there was \nno organisation\
  \ or operator in New Zealand that had been  approved by the CAA to conduct  \nmountain\
  \ flying training  as described in Advisory Circular 119 -3 (see paragraph 3.6.21)\
  \ .  \nConsequently t he operator did not give the pilot any recognised mountain\
  \ flying  training . \n4.4.26.  The speed with which the pilot was put through the\
  \ operator's training program me and the \nfact that the training program me was\
  \ not conducted in strict accordance with the Civil Aviation \nRules are signal\
  \ s that the operator's training system had not give n the pilot the training, \n\
  experience and supervision commensurate with the level of responsibility the pilot\
  \ was given  \nas an A -category pilot  and necessary to mitigate the hazards of\
  \ the area of operations.  \n4.4.27.  Given the shortcomings in the operator's training\
  \ system, the following section discusses the \noversight of the operation by senior\
  \ persons.  \nManagement oversight  \n4.4.28.  Senior management in aviation companies\
  \  are responsible for giving effective oversight of \ncompliance systems and processes.\
  \  However, the civil aviation rules and standards provide \nonly a minimum or 'foundation'\
  \ level of compliance.  Responsible management  operate s on a \ncontinuous improvement\
  \ basis to exceed minimum standards and achieve good or even best \nindustry practice.\
  \  In this case t he operator did not ac hieve compliance with those minimum \n\
  standards  outlined in the civil aviation rules, particularly in respect of providing\
  \ sufficient \npersonnel to plan, perform and supervise its operations .  This is\
  \ discussed further below.  \n4.4.29.  The finding s made in CAA audits, the minutes\
  \ of pilot meetings and the circumstances of the \noperator's three most recent\
  \ accidents were indicators that the operator had not provided \nsufficient senior\
  \ management oversight of  its operations  as required by  the Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ \nand as described in its exposition . \n4.4.30.  Civil Aviation Rule  119.101,\
  \ Personnel Requirements , stated:  \n(a) An applicant for the grant of a general\
  \ aviation air operator certificate must \nemploy, contract, or otherwise engage\
  \ \u2014  \n (1)  a senior person identified as the chief executive who \u2014 \n\
  (i) has the authority within the applicant's organisation to ensure that \nall activities\
  \ undertaken by the organisation can be financed and \ncarried out in accordance\
  \ with the requirements and standards \nprescribed by th is Part; and  \n      \
  \                                                  \n59 Operator's training manual,\
  \ section 3.2.1.  \n60 CAA audit 11/SPTG/36 refers.  \n61 Civil Aviation Rules 135.555\
  \ and 135.613 refer.  \n62 Operator's standard operating procedure, chapter 7. \
  \ \nFinal Report AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 35 >>\n (ii) is responsible for ensuring\
  \ that the organisation complies with the \nrequirements of [Part 119]; and \u2026\
  \  \n(3)  sufficient personnel to plan, perform, supervise, inspect, and certify\
  \ the \noperations listed in the applicant's exposition.  \n4.4.31.  The chief executive\
  \  was closely involved with other aspects of the  business and, in effect, left\
  \ \nthe daily management of the Fox Glacier tourism operation to the office manager\
  \ and the \ntraining supervisor .  However,  the office manager was not qualified\
  \ to supervise operations . \nTheir responsibility under the operator's exposition\
  \ was for occurrence investigation s only.  \nThe November 2015 pilot meeting had\
  \ noted, for the second time, that the chief executive \nwas difficult to contact\
  \ when advice was needed.  \n4.4.32.  The Civil Aviation Rule  requirements for\
  \ an air operator certificate recognised that a training \nmanager was a key person,\
  \ yet the approved individual had been absent for nearly four years.  \n4.4.33.\
  \  The training manager had known  that a training supervisor had been ap pointed\
  \ .  However, i t \nwas not until June 2015, when asking for details of the Hughes\
  \ H369  accident earlier that \nmonth,  that the training manager had learnt  that\
  \ their senior person  appointment might have  \nceased .  The training manager\
  \ had never been  formally advised by the chief executive of this \nchange.  \n\
  4.4.34.  In spite of the training manager  no longer  having  an active involvement\
  \ , the chief executive  \nhad not mention ed this situation, even during  the audit\
  \ in Ma rch 2015 that  examined  pilot \ntraining .  In Ja nuary 2015 t he operator\
  \ had request ed CAA approval to replace the training \nmanager  with either the\
  \ chief executive or the training supervisor , but the application  had \nbeen \
  \ declined . \n4.4.35.  The training supervisor, although well  intentioned, had\
  \ conducted pilot training outside the \napproved operations specifications.  The\
  \ pilot group had recorded a concern  about the lack of \nstructure in th e operator's\
  \ training system.63 \n4.4.36.  Other i ssues that involved the control of maintenance\
  \ (see paragraph  3.3.12)  and the control \nof aircraft weight and balance (paragraph\
  \ 4.3.18) were  examples of the non -compliances that \nwere  the subject of  findings\
  \ in other CAA audits of the operator.  \n4.4.37.  The operator 's internal audit\
  \ programme  had not made  findings or identified \ncorrective/preventive actions\
  \ for the management and training issues referred to above.  \n4.4.38.  CAA audit\
  \ reports showed that the CAA had had indications as early as March 2011 about \
  \ the \nabsence of the training manager , and was aware , at lea st from  2013,\
  \ that the training \nsupervisor  had effectively assumed the role .  However, the\
  \ CAA had made no findings about \nthese variations from the operations specifications\
  \ . \n4.4.39.  CAA inspectors  informed the Commission that there had been  discuss\
  \ ions with the operator \nand between  CAA staff regarding differ ent interpretations\
  \ of the rules applying to the \noperator's training situation , and whether the\
  \ training supervisor was a suitable candidate for \nthe training manager  position.\
  \   Some of the internal CA A discussions had been  recorded in \nemail s between\
  \ staff .  \n4.4.40.  The requirements for pilot instructors were stated in Civil\
  \ Aviation Rule  135.567, which read:  \n135.567 Flight crew member instructor qualifications\
  \  \nEach holder of an air operator certificate shall e nsure that any person carrying\
  \ out \nfunctions as an instructor in its flight crew member training programme\
  \ established \nunder this Part \u2014 \n(1) has satisfactorily completed the training\
  \ required by this Subpart to serve as \npilot-in-command in operations; and  \n\
  (2) holds a Category A, B, or D flight instructor rating; and  \n              \
  \                                          \n63 Minutes of pilot meeting held on\
  \ 2 July 2015.  \n\n<< Page 36 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -007 (3) completes initial\
  \ and recurrent training requirements applicable to the instruction \ncarried out.\
  \  \n4.4.41.  The CAA did not clarify its interpretation of the instructor requirements\
  \ until after the \naccident .64  The statement \"its flight crew member training\
  \ programme \" in the above rule \nmade it clear that instructor requirements had\
  \ to be read in conjunction  with the applicable \noperations specification .  If\
  \ the operator had had CAA approval to conduct internal flight \ntraining, then\
  \ the training supervisor, who held a Category D flight instructor rating , might\
  \  also \nhave been approved to conduct the training.  However, prior to the accident\
  \ there had been  no \nCAA approv al for  internal training  against which the instructional\
  \ competence of the training \nsupervisor  could have been assessed . \n4.4.42.\
  \  The CAA had commented on, and in some cases raised findings for, aspects  of\
  \ pilot training \nand competency checks after conducting audits of the operator\
  \  in 2005, 2008, 2011, 2013 \nand Ma rch 2015.  CAA staff were aware that  the\
  \ training supervisor had been conducting \ntraining, most likely since 2013, but\
  \ they had made no specific finding of non -compliance \nduring any audit between\
  \ then and the accident in No vember 2015.  \n4.4.43.  Following the accident, i\
  \ n a letter to the operator in February 2016 , the CAA express ed \nextreme concern\
  \ that the operator had \"appointed an unapproved person to act as the \ntraining\
  \ manager and also that unauthorised training ha s been conducted \".  The letter\
  \ added \nthat the  CAA had been \"led to believe \" by the  chief executive  at\
  \ previous audits that the \ntraining manager had been acting in that senior person\
  \ role .  However,  CAA auditors and \ninspectors had known  of the situation for\
  \ some  years .  This issue is di scussed in the following \nsection.  \n4.5. CAA\
  \ surveillance  \nSafety issue: The operator  had been allowed to continue providing\
  \ helicopter air operations \nwith little or no intervention from the C AA, in spite\
  \ of the CAA having identified significant non-\ncompliances with the operator's\
  \ training system and managerial oversight . \n4.5.1.  The CAA auditors and inspectors\
  \ had raised concern s at various audits since 2012 about the \noperator's management\
  \ oversight and training system.  However, the CAA had not respond ed \ndecisively\
  \ to the in formation provided by  its surveillance  unit. \n4.5.2.  As previously\
  \ discussed, t he CAA s urveillance s taff had had strong signals  for nearly four\
  \ years \nleading up to the accident  that the training manager was likely to have\
  \ had little  involve ment  \nwith the training  and checking of the operator's\
  \ pilots .  The CAA staff  had known  the extent  of \nthe training supervisor's\
  \ internal training, and very likely had known  that the operator had no \napproval\
  \ for this.  Some CAA surveillance staff admitted that th ere had been  some uncertaint\
  \ y \nwith interpreting the rul es but, in their view, t he training supervisor\
  \ had raised the operator's \nstandards.   Nevertheless, a n avoidable safety  risk\
  \ existed because the operator's training \nsystem, including the use of  internal\
  \ instructors, had not been formally assessed and \napproved  by the CAA .  \n4.5.3.\
  \  Without  any formal finding s having been raised during any audits at which this\
  \ situation was \nobserved, the CAA had not been able to address the  continued\
  \ non -compliance.  Inter nal CAA \nproce sses had not ensure d that higher -level\
  \ CAA manage rs were  made fully aware of  the true \nsituation .  Without the correct\
  \ information, the managers  could not take the most appropriate  \naction  necessary\
  \ to get the operator  to comp ly with the requirements of its air operator \ncertificate\
  \ . \n4.5.4.  The training manager 's absence was not a  'change' to the list of\
  \ approved senior person s, but \nthe substitution with the training supervisor\
  \  was a variation to the organisational structure \nthat the operator should  have\
  \ advised to the CAA.  The relevant Civil Aviation Rule  stated:  \n \n        \
  \                                                \n64 See section 7.4.  The CAA\
  \ further clarified the requirements by introducing the role of 'operational \n\
  instructor' to subsequent approvals of operator operations specifications.  \nFinal\
  \ Report AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 37 >>\n 119.165 Changes to certificate holder 's\
  \ organisation  \n(a) A holder of an air operator certificate must \u2014 (1) ensure\
  \ that its exposition is \namended so as to remain a current description of its\
  \ organisation\u2026  \n4.5.5.  However, as mentioned in the previous section, the\
  \ training and supervision of the pilot had \nnot been of a sufficient standard\
  \ for the level of responsibility the pilot was given.  This was a \nlikely consequence\
  \ of all the i ssues the auditors and CAA inspectors had identified over \nseveral\
  \ years.  Good standards of pilot training and supervision are critical to safe\
  \ operations.  \nThe CAA should have responded decisively to the observed and continuing\
  \  non-compliance in \nthose are as. \n4.5.6.  The CAA website noted that improvements\
  \ made in 2012 to its surveillance system had \nresulted in \"an enhanced risk profiling\
  \ process, and audits that are more focussed on the \nareas of higher risk within\
  \ an organisation \". \n4.5.7.  The Commission had identified a safety issue in\
  \ a previous inquiry65 where  the CAA regulatory \ntools had not been decisively\
  \ used when dealing with an other  operator who had recurring \naudit findings in\
  \ the areas of management and operatio ns.  On 26 February 2014 the \nCommission\
  \ had recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation : \nthat he apply stricter requirements\
  \ upon holders of air operator certificates to \ntake effective action  to correct\
  \ identified deficiencies, and that any serious safety \nissues that are identified\
  \ with managerial  oversight of airline operations always \nresult in findings (\
  \ recommendation 001/14 ). \n4.5.8.  A similar recommendation could be a pplied\
  \ in regard to the CAA 's surveillance of this \noperator .  CAA audits had identified\
  \ , although not necessarily made findings  about, the \nfollowing recurring areas\
  \ of concern : \n\uF0B7 organisational leadership - setting example s, compliance\
  \ with  the Civil Aviation Rules, \nthe chief executive's view of audits  \n\uF0B7\
  \ actions, required to correct audit findings, not completed by the agreed dates\
  \  \n\uF0B7 senior person absence and accessibility  \n\uF0B7 lack of transparency\
  \ about absence of training manager . \n4.6. Sector risk profile  for operations\
  \ conducted under Civil Aviation Rules Part 135  \n4.6.1.  Since 2011 the accident\
  \ rate in the New Zealand Part 135 aviation sector , which includes \nhelicopters\
  \ and small aeroplanes, had had an upward trend.  The underlying causes had not\
  \ \nbeen immediately apparent.  In 2015 the CAA had commissioned an external project\
  \ to \nexamine the underlying influences on safety within the sector and  to present\
  \ a risk profile of \nthe sector. The goal had been  to assess the risks and to\
  \ inform targeted and appropriate \nintervention s.  The CAA  published the first\
  \ report on 'Part 135 Sector Risk Profile ' on 27 \nNovember 2015  (Nav igatus Consulting,\
  \ 2015) . \n4.6.2.  The sector risk profile was updated in June 2018.  More information\
  \ is in Appendix 7. \n4.7. Summary  \n4.7.1.  At the time of this accident the operator\
  \ had one of the largest helicopter fleets in New \nZealand.  There were a number\
  \ of serious and persistent issues with the senior management \noversight of the\
  \ operation. Of particular relevance to this accident was management oversight \n\
  of its pilot training system and the degree of supervision it provided for its pilots.\
  \  \n4.7.2.  The operator carrie d the p rime responsibility for ensuring  that,\

  \n<< Page 38 >>\n Final Report AO -2015 -007 responsibility to conduct effective\
  \ surveillance of the operator as part of its monitoring \ncompliance across the\
  \ industry . \n4.7.3.  The CAA cannot reasonably be expected to ensure total compliance\
  \ by all participants in the \nsector.  However, its surveillance activity  should\
  \ ensure that where deficiencies are found they \nare formally recorded so that\
  \ regul atory decisions  can be informed.  Appropriate  action can \nthen be taken\
  \ to either cause change or remove the threat from the system before an \naccident\
  \ occur s. \n4.7.4.  In this case the CAA had had good cause and ample opportunities\
  \ to intervene at an early \nstage.  I nstead the operator had been  allowed to\
  \ continue , with little change to improve its \ntraining and management system\
  \ , and little improvement in senior management oversight of \nthe Fox Glacier operation\
  \ .  That s ituation  had put the pilot in a position of respo nsibility that \n\
  the pilot was not sufficiently trained or experienced for. \n4.7.5.  Ultimately\
  \ the pilot had been  prematurely put in a position to make  operational decisions,\
  \ \nunchecked.  Whatever happened a fter the helicopter lifted off from Chancellor\
  \ Shelf, the \naccident was a culmination  of deficiencies in the system that put\
  \ the pilot there on that day . \n4.7.6.  Since about 2010, in response to reviews\
  \ and recommendations, the CAA has made  a number \nof changes with a fo cus on\
  \ improving its performance of its regulatory role.  These changes  \nhave been\
  \  made  through the regulatory surveillance period  referred to in this report,\
  \ and as \nsuch are relevant to its oversight of this operator  prior  to the accident\
  \ .  The CAA refer red to \nsome of these earlier changes  in its response to a\
  \ previous recommendation made by  the \nCommission (refer to section 7of this report).\
  \  This work is an ongoing part of the CAA's \n'Regulatory Craft Programme' .  \n\
  Final Report AO -2015 -007 \n<< Page 39 >>\n 5. Findings  \n5.1. The helicopter\
  \ struck the glacier surface with a high forward speed  and a high rate of descent\
  \ , \nwith the engine delivering power.  \n5.2. Throughout t he flight, the all-up\
  \ weight of the helicopter almost certainly exceeded  the \nmaximum permitted weight.\
  \  \n5.3. It is unlikely that mechanical failure with the helicopter was a factor\
  \ in the accident.  Although \nnot al l of the wreckage was r ecovered , an examination\
  \ of the recovered components \n(including all the dynamic assemblies) revealed\
  \ no pre-existing failure . \n5.4. The tail rotor servo had exceeded the maximum\
  \ flight hours permitted before overhaul, \nalthough that was unlikely to have been\
  \ a contributory factor.  \n5.5. The weather conditions on the day were unstable\
  \ and unsuitable  for conducting a scenic \nflight .  The localis ed weather conditions\
  \ in the area were very likely to have been frequently \nbelow  the minimum criteria\
  \ required by the Civil Aviation Rules . \n5.6. It is very likely that when the\
  \ helicopter took off from Chancellor Shelf and descended down \nthe valley the\
  \ pilot's perception of the helicopter's height above  the terrain was affected\
  \ by \none or more of the following conditions:  \n\uF0B7 cloud \n\uF0B7 precipitation\
  \  \n\uF0B7 flat light condit ions \n\uF0B7 condensation on the helicopter 's front\
  \ windscreen . \n5.7. The pilot had not been properly trained and did not have the\
  \ appropriate level of experience  \nexpected under the operator's categorisation\
  \ scheme to fulfil the role and responsibilities  \nexpected of a s enior (A -category)\
  \ pilot in this type of operation . \n5.8. The operator's system for training its\
  \ pilots was ill -defined and did not comply fully with the \nCivil Aviation Rules.\
  \  \n5.9. The operator's training  system did not have sufficient oversight by the\
  \ designated sen ior \npersons .  This was a factor that allowed the pilot to be\
  \ assigned roles and responsibilities \nwithout  the proper  training and experience.\
  \  \n5.10.  The Civil Aviation Authority had identified significant  and repetitive\
  \ non-compliance issues with \nthe operator's training system and manage rial oversight\
  \  that warranted  interven tion long \nbefore this accident occurred.  \n  \n\n\
