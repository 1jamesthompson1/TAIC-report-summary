- name: Organisational Oversight and Compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
  explanation: Organisational oversight refers to the responsibility of senior management to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with established rules and regulations. In the context of this accident, the operator's senior management failed to provide effective oversight of compliance systems and processes, particularly in relation to pilot training and supervision. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had identified significant non-compliances with the operator's training system and managerial oversight, which should have warranted intervention before the accident occurred. The report states that "the operator's system for training its pilots was ill-defined and did not comply fully with the civil aviation rules" (4.8 (invalid formatted quote)) and "the operator's training system did not have sufficient oversight by the designated senior persons" (5.9). Furthermore, the CAA had "identified significant and repetitive non-compliance issues with the operator's training system and managerial oversight that warranted intervention long before this accident occurred" (5.10).
- name: Pilot Training and Experience
  explanation: Pilot training and experience are critical to ensuring that pilots are capable of making safe operational decisions and handling unexpected situations during flight. In this accident, the pilot was not properly trained and lacked the appropriate level of experience expected under the operator's categorisation scheme to fulfill the role and responsibilities of a senior (A-category) pilot. The report highlights that "the pilot had not been properly trained and did not have the appropriate level of experience expected under the operator's categorisation scheme to fulfil the role and responsibilities expected of a senior (A-category) pilot in this type of operation" (5.7). This lack of training and experience was a contributing factor to the accident, as the pilot was prematurely put in a position to make operational decisions unchecked (4.7.5).
- name: Weight and Balance Compliance
  explanation: Weight and balance compliance is essential for the safe operation of an aircraft, as it affects the aircraft's performance and handling characteristics. The report indicates that throughout the flight, the all-up weight of the helicopter almost certainly exceeded the maximum permitted weight (5.2). This non-compliance with weight and balance limits could have restricted the pilot's options for maneuvering the helicopter at low speed (4.3.22) and contributed to the accident by affecting the helicopter's performance.
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  explanation: Weather conditions play a significant role in aviation safety, particularly for visual flight rules (VFR) operations. The weather on the day of the accident was unstable and unsuitable for conducting a scenic flight, with localized conditions likely frequently below the minimum criteria required by the Civil Aviation Rules (5.5). The pilot's decision to continue the flight under such conditions was imprudent (4.4.9), and it is very likely that when the helicopter took off from Chancellor Shelf, the pilot's perception of the helicopter's height above the terrain was affected by adverse weather conditions (5.6).
- name: Regulatory Surveillance and Enforcement
  explanation: Regulatory surveillance and enforcement are necessary to ensure that aviation operators adhere to safety standards and regulations. In this case, the CAA's surveillance activity failed to ensure that deficiencies identified in the operator's compliance were formally recorded and addressed. The report criticizes the CAA for not taking appropriate action to either cause change or remove the threat from the system before an accident occurs, stating that "the CAA cannot reasonably be expected to ensure total compliance by all participants in the sector. However, its surveillance activity should ensure that where deficiencies are found they are formally recorded so that regulatory decisions can be informed" (4.7.3). The lack of decisive action by the CAA allowed the operator to continue with little change to improve its training and management system (4.7.4).
- name: Visual Cues and Spatial Disorientation
  explanation: Visual cues are essential for pilots to maintain orientation and control of the aircraft, especially during VFR operations. Spatial disorientation can occur when visual cues are lost or obscured, leading to a loss of control. The report suggests that the pilot likely lost awareness of the helicopter's height above the glacier due to conditions such as cloud, precipitation, flat light conditions, or condensation on the windscreen (5.6). This loss of visual reference could have led to the pilot's inability to avoid a collision with the terrain.
