  \ discussed below in the analysis of this accident:  \n\uF0B7 the standard of maintenance\
  \ performed on th e aeroplane  \n\uF0B7 the standard of maintenance generally in\
  \ general aviation in New Zealand.  \n4.2 The nose landing gear did not lower normally\
  \ because it jammed in a partially retracted position \nwhile the pilot was applying\
  \ substantial rudder input at the same time as retracting the landing \ngear.  Applying\
  \ substantial rudder to counter the yaw created when one engine fails, or in this\
  \ case \nis simulated to fail , is a normal action that should not have resulted\
  \ in the nose landing gear \njamming.  The reasons for its jamm ing are discu ssed\
  \ in the following analysis.  \n4.3 Civil Aviation Rules describe d the minimum\
  \ requirements for maintaining and repairing aircraft.  \nThey also place d responsibility\
  \ on individuals and organisations for ensuring that repair and \nmaintenance were\
  \  performed in a p roper way that did not compromise safety.  The following \n\
  analysis describes how failures by participants in the system resulted in certain\
  \ defects with the \nnose landing gear, which  contributed to it s jamming during\
  \ the accident flight.  \nWhat caused the nose  landing gear to jam ? \n4.4 On the\
  \ approach to Nelson, the nose landing gear was locked down when the flight examiner\
  \ \nsimulated the engine failure by reducing the power on one engine to idle.  At\
  \ the minimum altitude \nfor the approach,  the pilot applied full powe r on the\
  \ other engine to carry out a missed approach.  \nThis had the effect of the a eroplane\
  \  tending  to yaw, which  the pilot counteracted by applying up to \nmaximum rudder\
  \ pedal deflection before selecting the landing gear up.  This was the normal way\
  \ to \ndeal with the situation  - a situation with which the a eroplane  landing\
  \ gear systems were designed \nto cope.  \n4.5 When full rudder was applied  with\
  \ the landing gear extended,  the nose wheel  also turned .  When \nthe landing\
  \ gear was  then  retracted the  bushing on the end of the align ment  bracket should\
  \ have \nbeen captured by the flared mouth of the align ment guide.  This bushing\
  \ on the bracket should \nhave then moved  down into the narrowing throat of the\
  \ guide, thereby centring the nose  wheel as it \nretrac ted.  Instead the bushing\
  \ missed being captured by the guide and jammed outside it.  The \nnose  wheel did\
  \ not centre and the system jammed in a half -retracted  condition.  Repeated \n\
  attempts by the pilot to cycle the landing gear failed to free the nose landin g\
  \ gear from this \njammed state.  \n4.6 There are a number of reasons for the alignment\
  \ bracket not being captured by the align ment  \nguide.  These range from the wrong\
  \ parts being fitted to the nose  wheel assembly to improper \nmaintenance of parts\
  \ within the assembly .  These are now discussed in more detail.  \nFitting of incorr\
  \ ect parts  \n4.7 One reason  for the alignment bracket not being captured by the\
  \ align ment  guide was that the nose  \nleg could turn past the nominal 20 \xB0\
  \ because the wrong housing had been installed.  After  the nose \nwheel was turned\
  \ to its nominal maximum of 20 \xB0, the slipstream may have turned it further \n\
  (possibly up to 40 \xB0) once the steering arm had disengaged from the steering\
  \ bell -crank as the \nnose landing gear started to retract .  Had it been intended\
  \ to  fit the modified housing, t he strut \nhead parts associated with Piper Service\
  \ Spares Letter No. 352 (the modification) should also have \nbeen fitted.  If th\
  \ ose parts  had been fitt ed, the nose leg would have been brought back to the\
  \ \xB120 \xB0 \nrange (see paragraph  3.3.8) where the alignment bracket would have\
  \ engage d with the alignment \nguide . \n4.8 The PA -42 label found on the housing\
  \ after the accident strongly suggested that a Cheyenne \nhousing (part number 45316\
  \ -00) had been  mistakenly supplied and installed in January  2007, \nafter part\
  \ number 45316 -03 had been  wrongly used when describing the defect and to order\
  \ the \nreplacement housing.  The last log book reference to the housing , prior\
  \ to the January 2007 repair,  \nhad quoted part number 40273 -00, which was correct\
  \ for an aeroplane with an  unmodified nose \nlanding gear .  There was no other\
  \ record of maintenance during which the incorrect  housing might \n\n<< Page 18\
  \ >>\n Report 11 -004  have been fitted to the aeroplane .  The 2 different housing\
  \ part numbers  were  listed on adjacent \nlines in the Parts Catalo gue, so the\
  \ use of the incorrect part number could have been a  simple case \nof misreading\
  \ the Catalogue or not checking the applicable aeroplane serial number range.  \
  \ The \nremnant of the PA-42 label  also illustrated th e need for manufacturers\
  \ to use more per manent \nmethods to identify  individual parts .  \n4.9 The part\
  \ number error was repeated in subsequent maintenance log book entries.  The likely\
  \ \nreason was that those making the entries referred to the part number used previously\
  \ in the log \nbook, rather than  physically checking for a part number on the item\
  \ and comparing that with the \nMaintenance Manual or Parts Catalogue.  There was\
  \ no further maintenance recorded on the \nhousing that might have drawn attention\
  \ to it being the wrong part.  \n4.10 The physical differe nces between the housings\
  \ did not prevent re -assembly of the strut, but the \neffect on the other nose\
  \ landing gear components and their geometric relationship was unclear.  \nThe fitted\
  \ housing would have been suitable had the nose landing gear modification described\
  \  in \nPiper Service Spares Letter No. 352 been embodied on the aeroplane, but\
  \ it had not been.  \nHowever, the original steering arm and other components on\
  \ the strut head were still fitted, so, in \neffect, the aeroplane was half -modified.\
  \  Piper advise d that the mismatch of components was a \nnon-conforming and unapproved\
  \ assembly that could have contributed to the non -engagement of \nthe bushing.\
  \  In particular, the gap between the alignment bracket and align ment guide might\
  \ have \nbeen greater  than it would  have been with the correct parts installed\
  \ . \n4.11 It is possible that this greater gap between the alignment bracket and\
  \ alignment guide was the \nreason for someone weld ing extensions to the sides\
  \ of the alignment guide.  During the repair in \nApril 2011, the ali gnment guide\
  \ with the welded sides was replaced with the correct part.  As the \nsides of the\
  \ correct guide were l ess high , the replacement  had the unanticipated effect\
  \ of \nincreasing the vertical separation between the guide and the bracket.  \n\
  4.12 Wear marks on t he align ment  guide observed after the accident  indicated\
  \ that the alignment \nbracket (replaced in January 2011) had only partially engaged\
  \ with the guide dur ing recent  nose \nlanding gear retraction s.  Reports by pilots\
  \ of incidents in December 2010 and April 2011 \nsuggested th at th e alignment\
  \ bracket bushing had not been engaging  with the guide fully for some \ntime, even\
  \ under normal flight conditions.  \n4.13 A retraction and extension check  of the\
  \ nose landing g ear, as described in the Maintenance \nManual, was performe d with\
  \ the nose wheel aligned fore and aft . Therefore the effectiveness of the \nalign\
  \ ment  guide in centr ing the nose wheel when it was turned was rarely , if ever,\
  \  check ed.  On the \naeroplane, t he separation between the alignment bracket\
  \ bushing and the align ment  guide  was \ntoo great , a situation that almost certainly\
  \  had existed before the accident . \n4.14 The steering bell -crank pivot bolt\
  \ (part number 401410), which secured the alignment bracket , was \nbent in such\
  \ a way as to increase the separation between the bracket and guide .  The bolt\
  \ could \nhave been  bent in the same event that damaged the other steering system\
  \ parts that had been  \nrepaired in November 2008.   However, the pivot  bolt secure\
  \ d the steering bell -crank central \nbushing  too, and that was replaced then\
  \ .  P resumably the bolt's condition was considered  \nsatisfactory at th at time.\
  \   The pilots cycled the landing gear several times during the accident flight\
  \ \nto try to resolve the problem.  Wit h the assembly jammed , it is possible that\
  \ the pivot bolt was bent \nat this time .    \n4.15 The flat washer (part number\
  \ 407587), which the Parts Catalogue shows installed between the \nsteering bell\
  \ -crank and the alignment bracket, was found to be missing after the accident.\
  \  The \nwasher could have been left out at the November 2008 rectification or at\
  \ any of the 3 subsequent \noccasions when the alignment bracket was disturbed.\
  \  Each of those occasions  involved a different \nmaintenance provider.  \n4.16\
  \ Regardless of when and where the washer was omitted, its absence resulted in the\
  \ alignment \nbracket bushing being raised farther away from the align ment  guide,\
  \ in addition to the increased \nseparation caused  by the bent bolt .  The missing\
  \ washer also meant that the contact areas of the \nsteering arm bushings on the\
  \ steering bell -crank were reduced.  \n  \nReport 11 -004 \n<< Page 19 >>\n Findings\
  \ :  \n1. The nose landing gear did not lower normally because it had jammed in\
  \ a partially \nretracted position .  The landing gear  jammed because  the nose\
  \  wheel align ment  \nbracket lodged outside (instead of slotting into ) the align\
  \ ment  guide as the landing \ngear retracted.  \n2. The nose wheel align ment \
  \ bracket lodged outside the align ment  guide for the \nfollowing  reasons:  \n\
  a. the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the \n\
  aeroplane allowed the nose  wheel to turn in excess of the nominal 20 \xB0 \nb.\
  \ the replacement of the modified alignment guide in April 2011 increased the \n\
  vertical separation between the guide and the alig nment bracket  \nc. the pivot\
  \ bolt securing the steering bell -crank was bent and missing a washer , \nwhich\
  \ meant the align ment  bracket was less likely to engage fully with the \nalign\
  \ ment  guide.  \n \nRepair and maintenance  of the nose landing gear  \n4.17 The\
  \ aeroplane had a recent history of similar nose landing gear defects, the most\
  \ recent being less \nthan one month before this accident.  The records show ed\
  \ that s ome of the maintenance had not \nbeen performed in accordance with Civil\
  \ Aviation Rules, particularly in regard to compliance with \nprescribed maintenance\
  \ procedures.  \n4.18 Since November 2008 there had been recurring occurrences of\
  \ the steering arm being found \nloose.  Nose wheel shimmy had been  a suspected\
  \ cause, because during shimmy the bushings on \nthe steering arm \"hammer ed\"\
  \ against the steering bell-crank .  Evidence of hammering was found \non the bell-crank\
  \  after the accident.  \n4.19 Fieldair's records showed that d uring the rectification\
  \ of the November 2008 dama ge to the \nsteering system , an alignment bracket had\
  \ been  ordered  to replace the one damaged , but the log \nbook  did not show that\
  \  the replacement had been  fitted.  Therefore the damaged bracket might \nhave\
  \ stayed on the aeroplane until December 2010 , when the log book showed that it\
  \ had next \nbeen replaced . \n4.20 Reference has already been made to the w asher\
  \ missing between t he steering bell -crank and the \nalignment bracket .  It was\
  \ not established when the washer had been  left out, but i f the various \nengineers\
  \ who had worked on that assembly in recent jobs had refer red to the Maintenance\
  \ \nManual and/or Parts Catalogue, as good practice would have required, they should\
  \ have seen that \nthe washer was missing.  \n4.21 The reason for the steering arm\
  \ l oosen ing on previous  occasions was th at it had been  installed \nwith the\
  \ wrong cap bolts , which  could not be lock -wired.  The va rious attempts to rectify\
  \ th e \nrecurring defect  had failed because the wrong bolts  were not noticed.\
  \  \n4.22 Had the Maintenance M anual bee n followed  at each repair , the absence\
  \ of lock -wiring , and hence \nthe incorrect bolts,  should have been noticed before\
  \  April 2011 .  In spite of having seen these \nerrors , the engineer involved\
  \ in th e April 2011 repair inexplicably omitted to install lock-wire.  This \n\
  was discovered when the aeroplane was examined after the accident.  \n4.23 The observations\
  \ made  in April 2011 illustrated the following deficiencies in maintenance \npractices\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 unapproved  repair s - the align ment  guide  being built up with poor\
  \ weldi ng and the use of \nhelic al inserts  \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Report 11 -004\
  \  \uF0B7 the use of the wrong parts  - the cap bolts  \n\uF0B7 a failure to refer\
  \ to, or to comply with, the appropriate  technical  data - for example,  the \n\
  lack of lock -wire on the cap bolts . \n4.24 The April 2011 incident  appeared,\
  \ from the pilot's description,  to have been caused by the \nalignment bracket\
  \ bushing catching  on a sharp edge of the modified  (welded) align ment  guide\
  \  as \nthe landing gear extended .  As the same align ment  guide had been  in\
  \ place the previous \nDecemb er, it was likely that the bushing had caught on the\
  \ align ment  guide edge on that occasion \ntoo, causing it to break off. \n4.25\
  \ The welded \"repair \" to the align ment  guide, possibly done to correct a n\
  \ earlier  problem of non -\nengagement of the align ment  bracket , was to an unacceptable\
  \ standard  and should not have been \napproved .  The sharp and ragged inner edges\
  \ of the welding clearly had a high potential for \npreventing  the alignment bracket\
  \ bushing rolling smoothly in the guide.  As not all of the  \nmaintenance log s\
  \ for the aeroplane  could be found , contrary to a Civil Aviation Rule requirement,\
  \ \nthe date of that repair could not be determined.  \n4.26 The log book show ed\
  \ that the incorrect cap bolts  found in April 2011 had been  installed  during\
  \ the  \nSeptember 2009  repair .  The engineer who had certified that repair said\
  \ he thought that the large \nbolts might have replaced similar bolts .  If that\
  \ was so, it was likely that helical  inserts had been \ninstalled during  a previous\
  \ repair.  The available log books did not show that.  \n4.27 Two of the bolts were\
  \ for Lycoming engine s and none of the 3 had provision for lock -wiring.  \nTherefore\
  \ the ir use in the September 2009 repair had not been \"in accordance with the\
  \ Chieftain \nMaintenance Manual section 7 -8\", as had been  certified  in the\
  \ log b ook.  In the event, these \nrepairs proved ineffective, because the steering\
  \ defects recurred.  \n4.28 To accommodate the larger bolts , bigger holes had been\
  \ drilled in the align ment  guide mounting \nflange and the steering arm, and also\
  \ in to the inner cylinder.  Helic al inserts had been used to \nprovide the thread\
  \ inside the cylinder , but th eir use  had not been recorded in the log book .\
  \  The \ninvestigation could not  determine whether the September 2009 repair had\
  \ been  the first occasion \nthat helical inserts were  used for this repair . \
  \  \n4.29 CAA staff said that the larger bolts and helical  inserts were not a repair\
  \ option shown in the Piper \nMaintenance Manual  and were therefore unapproved\
  \ .  Their use would have r equire d the prior \napproval of the C AA or a design\
  \ organisation certificated by the Authority, and any such  approval to \nbe recorded\
  \ with the other details in the maintenance log book.  \n4.30 The rectification\
  \ of the December 2010  defect  illustrated  the following examples of inadequate\
  \  or \nincorrect maintenance:  \n\uF0B7 failure to investigat e fully the cause\
  \ of a defect  \n\uF0B7 failure to refer to, or to comply with, the appropriate\
  \ technical data \n\uF0B7 inaccurate statement in a loose -leaf log book entry of\
  \ the maintenance performed  \n\uF0B7 ineffective supervision  of an unlicensed\
  \  engineer's work . \n4.31 The engineer  who had investigated and corrected the\
  \ loose steering arm in December 2010 had \nnot notice d that the align ment  guide\
  \ was in poor condition and that it might have  cause d the \nalign ment  bracket\
  \ bushing  to break off .  It is difficult to comprehend that he would not have\
  \ \nnoticed the inappropriate repair  to the guide , because he was working on that\
  \ component at the \ntime. \n4.32 It is good aeronautical engineering practice not\
  \ only to effect p roper  repair s and parts ' \nreplacement, but t o identify the\
  \ cause s of defect s.  This is especially relevant when dealing with \nrecurring\
  \ defect s.  Proper supervision should ensure that appropriate fault -finding is\
  \ carried out.  \n  \nReport 11 -004 \n<< Page 21 >>\n The Commission has previously\
  \ commented on th e importance of establishing the underlying \ncauses of system\
  \ defects, rather than making isolated repairs on each occasion.30 \n4.33 The unlicensed\
  \ engineer  said he  had \"torqued \" the bolts securing the steering arm and align\
  \ ment  \nguide, meaning that he applied the torque specified in the M aintenance\
  \ Manual .  The Piper Manual \nwas available on -line at the hangar , but the engineer\
  \ cannot have read the relevant procedure  \ncarefully , otherwise he would have\
  \ seen  that the next step was to lock -wire the bolts.   The absence \nof holes\
  \ in the head of the bolt to take lock-wire should then have led him to question\
  \ his \nsupervisor about the suitability of the bolts.  \n4.34 The engineer later\
  \ explained the lack of lock-wire by saying, in  effect , \"the condition of the\
  \ \naeroplane when it comes in is how it goes out \".  In other words, there was\
  \ no lock -wire on the bolts \nwhen it came in, so none was used when it went  out.\
  \  This thinking is not consistent with the \nrequirements of Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ or with best aviation engineering practice.  \n4.35 Following th e December 2010\
  \  rectification, the alignment bracket was replaced by a different \norganisation.\
  \  The incorrect part number stated in the log book entry for the subsequent \n\
  replacement of the loaned alignment bracket might have been a simple mistake, but\
  \ it showed th e \nimporta nce of reading  manuals and catalogues  very carefully\
  \ .  Once an incorrect part number is \nquoted, even though the correct part might\
  \ actually have been fitted, t here is a high risk of the \nnumber error being repeated\
  \ subsequently  - when ordering a replacement part or when \ndetermining the applicability\
  \ of an airworthiness directive , for example .  The error could then have \nmore\
  \ serious consequences , such as in the ordering and fitting of the incorrect strut\
  \ housing in \n2007 .  Careful re ference to the acceptable  technical data and\
  \ p hysical checks of parts and \ncomparison s with their release notes  will minimise\
  \  that risk.  \n4.36 Other examples of careless and incorrect maintenance practices\
  \ identified during this inquiry \nincluded the loss or misplacement of the aeroplane\
  \  log books  and the use of a thread sealing \nproduct (e.g. Loctite) that was\
  \ not suited to the task . \nThe overall standard of general aviation aircraft maintenance\
  \  \n4.37 The Civil Aviation Rules and the associated A dvisory Circulars state\
  \ d the responsibilities of persons \nengaged in aircraft maintenance.  The continued\
  \ airworthiness of aircraft depend ed, among other \nthings, on all participants\
  \ following the published procedures and accepted practices , and  meeting \nthe\
  \ responsibilities of their licences and approvals ; and upon diligent supervision.\
  \  These \nrequirements include d the duplicate (independent) checking of control\
  \ systems that were  critical to \nsafety before they and aircraft  were  released\
  \ to service after any d isturbance or adjustment . \nHowever, th e landing gear\
  \ was not a control system that need ed independent checking  after \nmaintenance\
  \ . \n4.38 The investigation of this one event identified a variety of inadequate\
  \ maintenance practices by a \nvariety of persons in different maintenance organisations\
  \ over 4 or 5 years.  In the same period, \nroutine audits of those organisations\
  \ by the C AA did not ide ntify any indications of such \nmaintenance issues.  The\
  \ Commission accept s that it is probable that most aircraft maintenance \nwas performed\
  \ correctly and to the required standards, but it is concerned that the identified\
  \ poor \nmain tenance on the aeroplane was not limited to one person or one organisation\
  \ . \n4.39 The Commission ha s previously found similar issues with the practices\
  \ of a maintenance provider \nfor commercial balloons and recommended th at th e\
  \ Director of Civil Aviation address th is safety \nissue.  The Com mission believes\
  \ that these new findings could indicate that the quality of general \naviation\
  \ aircraft maintenance , particularly that performed by other than certificated\
  \ maintenance \norganisation s, needs to be improved if it is to meet the requirements\
  \ of C ivil Aviation Rules.  The \nCommission recommend ed the Director of Civil\
  \ Aviation to take the necessary action to address \nthis wider safety issue.  \n\
  4.40 air2there had 4 maintenance controllers during the period of the recurring\
  \ nose landing gear \ndefects and incidents, but the underlying cause of the defects\
  \ was found only after this accident.  It \n                                   \
  \                     \n30 Report 10 -010, Bombardier DHC -8-311, ZK -NEB, landing\
  \ without nose landing gear extended, Woodbourne (Blenheim) \nAerodrome, 30 September\
  \ 2010 . \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Report 11 -004  was likely that the  high turnover\
  \ of maintenance controllers hindered  the recogni tion of  an \nemerging trend\
  \ with the performance of the aeroplane nose wheel landing gear.  Earl ier recognition\
  \ \nof the problem should have prevented this accident . \n4.41 When maintenance\
  \ is performed on an aircraft away from its maintenance base, the engineer will\
  \ \nbe unlikely to have access to the aircraft's maintenance records.   This could\
  \ contribute to a \nrecurring defect not being recognised.  Therefore advice of\
  \ any relevant recent defects  - which will \naid in the  identification of the\
  \ root cause of the present defect - should be supplied by the usual \nengineer\
  \ or the Maintenance Controller.  The loose -leaf log book entry that records the\
  \ defect and \nrectification should be entered promptly into th at aircraft's log\
  \ book.  An imm ediate review of the \npast maintenance will help with the recognition\
  \ of possible recurring defects . \n4.42 The best time to detect a maintenance error\
  \ is at or close to the time that it is made, as the \npossibility of noticing the\
  \ error diminishes with time.  A udits  and annual reviews of airworthiness \nare\
  \ not intended to be safety nets to catch such e rrors.  Even if an annual  review\
  \ is conducted by \nsomeone  independent of all maintenance carried out during the\
  \ review p eriod , it is unlikely t hat it \nwill detect a physical maintenance\
  \  error - such as the installation of a wrong part - made during \nthat period\
  \ .   \n4.43 The incorrect strut housing had remained  on the aeroplane for more\
  \ than 4 years .  The \nCommission is concerned that such a maintenance error, in\
  \ a significant system of an aeropla ne \nused for air transport operations,  could\
  \  remain  undetected  unless and until it was discovered by \nchance or as a result\
  \ of an incident or accident .  The Commission accept s that most  participants\
  \ in \nthe aviation system carry out their work conscientiously .  However, much\
  \ aircraft maintenance is \nperformed by individuals and is not subject to duplicate\
  \  check s. \n4.44 The Commission believes that more safeguards should be in place\
  \ to detect and correct  \nmaintenance errors , at least in aircraft used for ai\
  \ r transport operations.  Accordingly, the \nCommission recommend ed the Director\
  \ of Civil Aviation to widen the scope of aircraft systems that \nrequire duplicate\
  \  check s after specified maintenance , at least for those aircraft used in air\
  \ \ntransport operations, in order to reduce the likelihood of recurring defects\
  \ and incidents . \nFindings:  \n3. Improper repair  and maintenance practices spanning\
  \ several maintenance \norgani sations and individual maintenance engineers over\
  \ several years contributed \nto a series of defects and incident s involving the\
  \ nose landing gear assembly on \nthe aeroplane.  \n4. Repairing and replacing \
  \ defective components without identifying the reason for \ntheir failure in the\
  \ first place is a serious safety issue that will likely result in repeat  \naccidents\
  \ and incidents for the same reasons.  \n5. Although much  aircraft maintenance\
  \ is done under supervision, the  requirement \nfor a  duplicate  check after maintenance\
  \ is limited to a few defined control systems.  \nThe landing gear is not one of\
  \ those systems,  but an undetected maintenance \nerror in the landing gear system\
  \ has the potential to cause a serious incident or \naccident . \n  \n  \n  \nReport\
