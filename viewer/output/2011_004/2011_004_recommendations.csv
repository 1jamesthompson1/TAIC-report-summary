2011_004,018/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he take action, in concert with the aviation industry, to improve the level of compliance with Civil Aviation Rules and conformance with industry best practice throughout the general aviation maintenance sector.","The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that general aviation maintenance practices in New Zealand are not always in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules or accepted industry practice. The findings show that non-compliance occurs in certificated maintenance organisations and by individual maintenance engineers exercising their individual licence privileges. This is an indication that the safety issue is not specific to just one sector of aviation maintenance. If left unchecked this situation is likely to have significant implications for aviation safety.

2011_004,019/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he widen the range of aircraft systems that require duplicate checks after specified maintenance, at least for those aircraft used in air transport operations, in order to reduce the likelihood of recurring defects and incidents.","The requirement for duplicate inspections after maintenance is performed on critical aircraft systems reduces the risk of a maintenance error remaining undetected and causing an accident. However, there are only a few specified control systems that are deemed critical and that require duplicate inspections. There are other important systems â€“ for example, the landing gear and brakes â€“ that are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. This is a safety issue, particularly for aircraft used in air transport operations where the consequences of an accident could be greater.

The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that because duplicate inspections are currently confined to critical control systems only, the risk of undetected maintenance errors in important, but non-critical, aircraft systems is not sufficiently mitigated. This accident was a prime example of how maintenance errors that are made in an important system and that are not detected then or during subsequent maintenance can become causal factors in an accident. The risks were higher in this case because the relevant maintenance events had been performed by independent engineers on parts of an aeroplane sub-system that were not subject to duplicate inspections.
