- name: Inadequate Maintenance Practices
  explanation: Inadequate maintenance practices were a significant factor in this accident, as evidenced by the series of defects and incidents involving the nose landing gear assembly that were attributed to improper repair and maintenance spanning several years and multiple maintenance organizations. The report states that "improper repair and maintenance practices spanning several maintenance organisations and individual maintenance engineers over several years contributed to a series of defects and incidents involving the nose landing gear assembly on the aeroplane" (4.44). This theme is relevant because it highlights the systemic nature of the maintenance deficiencies that led to the accident.
- name: Use of Incorrect Parts
  explanation: "The use of incorrect parts in the maintenance of the aircraft was a direct contributor to the accident. The report details that \"the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane allowed the nose wheel to turn in excess of the nominal 20\xB0\" (5.2.a), and that the incorrect housing was installed due to a part number error (4.8). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of using the correct parts for maintenance to ensure the proper functioning of critical aircraft systems."
- name: Lack of Compliance with Maintenance Procedures
  explanation: The accident was also related to a lack of compliance with prescribed maintenance procedures. The report indicates that "some of the maintenance had not been performed in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules, particularly in regard to compliance with prescribed maintenance procedures" (4.17). This theme is relevant because it points to the necessity of adhering to established maintenance procedures to maintain aircraft safety.
- name: Recurring Defects Not Properly Addressed
  explanation: The failure to properly address recurring defects is another safety theme related to this accident. The report finds that "repairing and replacing defective components without identifying the reason for their failure in the first place is a serious safety issue that will likely result in repeat accidents and incidents for the same reasons" (5.4). This theme is relevant as it emphasizes the need for thorough investigation and understanding of the root causes of defects to prevent their recurrence.
- name: Inadequate Supervision and Oversight
  explanation: Inadequate supervision and oversight of maintenance activities contributed to the accident. The report mentions that "proper supervision should ensure that appropriate fault-finding is carried out" (4.32) and that the high turnover of maintenance controllers hindered the recognition of an emerging trend with the performance of the aeroplane nose wheel landing gear (4.40). This theme is relevant because it highlights the role of supervision in ensuring maintenance quality and in identifying and addressing potential trends that could lead to accidents.
- name: Insufficient Independent Checks
  explanation: The lack of independent checks after maintenance, especially for non-control systems like the landing gear, is a safety theme related to this accident. The report states that "although much aircraft maintenance is done under supervision, the requirement for a duplicate check after maintenance is limited to a few defined control systems. The landing gear is not one of those systems" (5.5). This theme is relevant as it suggests that additional safeguards, such as independent checks, could help detect and correct maintenance errors that might otherwise lead to serious incidents or accidents.
