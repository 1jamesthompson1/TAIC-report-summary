- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Human error played a role in the accident, particularly in the repeated use of incorrect parts and failure to follow maintenance procedures ("the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane" (4.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the replacement of the modified alignment guide in april 2011 increased the vertical separation between the guide and the alignment bracket" (4.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the pivot bolt securing the steering bell-crank was bent and missing a washer" (4.12-4.16)). However, the document does not explicitly attribute the accident to assumptions made by individuals.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that maintenance errors due to a lack of adherence to the Maintenance Manual and Parts Catalogue were contributing factors ("the various engineers who had worked on that assembly in recent jobs had referred to the Maintenance Manual and/or Parts Catalogue, as good practice would have required, they should have seen that the washer was missing" (4.20), "the incorrect bolts were not noticed" (4.21 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This suggests issues with training and competency in maintenance practices.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document suggests that maintenance personnel may not have been fully familiar with the correct components and procedures for the nose landing gear system, leading to the use of incorrect parts and improper repairs ("the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane" (4.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the replacement of the modified alignment guide in april 2011 increased the vertical separation between the guide and the alignment bracket" (4.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Crew Resource Management

  explanation: 'There is no mention of crew resource management issues contributing to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document repeatedly cites failures to adhere to safety procedures and maintenance protocols as contributing factors to the accident ("the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane" (4.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the pivot bolt securing the steering bell-crank was bent and missing a washer" (4.12-4.16), "the various attempts to rectify the recurring defect had failed because the wrong bolts were not noticed" (4.21)).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document indicates that the maintenance issues were not isolated to one person or organization, suggesting a broader problem with the safety culture within the general aviation maintenance community in New Zealand ("the identified poor maintenance on the aeroplane was not limited to one person or one organisation" (4.38), "the commission believes that these new findings could indicate that the quality of general aviation aircraft maintenance...needs to be improved" (4.39 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the document does not explicitly discuss risk management and analysis, the failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with incorrect maintenance practices indirectly points to deficiencies in this area ("the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane" (4.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the pivot bolt securing the steering bell-crank was bent and missing a washer" (4.12-4.16)).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document highlights issues with compliance to Civil Aviation Rules and the lack of detection of maintenance issues by regulatory audits, indicating a problem with regulatory oversight and compliance ("the records showed that some of the maintenance had not been performed in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules" (4.17), "routine audits of those organisations by the CAA did not identify any indications of such maintenance issues" (4.38)).
- name: Situational Awareness

- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document details numerous instances where maintenance and inspection regimes were inadequate, leading to the use of incorrect parts and improper repairs that contributed to the accident ("the incorrect nose landing gear strut housing that had been fitted to the aeroplane" (4.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "the pivot bolt securing the steering bell-crank was bent and missing a washer" (4.12-4.16), "the various attempts to rectify the recurring defect had failed because the wrong bolts were not noticed" (4.21)).
