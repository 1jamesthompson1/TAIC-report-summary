    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The driver's failure to adhere to the maximum permissible speed while exiting the crossing loop was a direct violation of safety procedures and contributed to the derailment (3.10, 3.11).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The suggestion to prevent heavier trains from using the crossing loop was not adopted after a previous incident, which indicates a potential issue with the organization's safety culture (3.33, 3.34). This lack of action on known safety suggestions may have indirectly contributed to the accident.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that inadequate risk management and analysis were factors in the derailment.

    '
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance

- name: Other
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The phenomenon of dynamic interaction, which includes the combined effects of speed, track geometry, and the high center of gravity of the wagons, was identified as the primary cause of the derailment (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5). This theme encompasses the interplay of multiple factors that individually would not cause a derailment but together resulted in the accident.
