- name: Speed Management
  explanation: Speed management is a critical safety theme as it involves the control of train velocity to ensure it remains within safe operational limits. In the case of this accident, excessive speed was identified as a contributory factor to the derailment. The train "reached 31 km/h when it was allowed to coast" (3.6) and "the speed of the train had risen to 37 km/h" (3.9) which was "9 km/h or 36% over the maximum permissible line speed at the crossing loop" (3.10). This indicates that the train was traveling significantly faster than the designated safe speed, which contributed to the dynamic interaction that led to the derailment (3.11).
- name: Driver Distraction
  explanation: Driver distraction is a safety theme that refers to the loss of attention to critical tasks due to non-driving activities, which can lead to accidents. In this incident, the driver's attention was diverted from controlling the train's speed to reading route paperwork (3.12). This distraction occurred during a "critical time when it was essential to control the train speed on a downhill gradient through low speed points" (3.12), which allowed the train to accelerate beyond the safe speed limit, contributing to the derailment.
- name: Track Condition
  explanation: Track condition is a safety theme that encompasses the physical state of the railway infrastructure, which can influence the risk of derailments. Although the track twist was within KiwiRail's tolerance limits (3.14), it was still considered a contributory factor to the derailment due to dynamic interaction (3.15). The track twist likely started a rocking motion of the wagons, which, when combined with other factors such as speed and the wagons' high center of gravity, contributed to the derailment (3.15).
- name: Wagon Loading and Center of Gravity
  explanation: Wagon loading and center of gravity is a safety theme that involves the distribution of cargo within a wagon and its effect on the wagon's stability. The investigation found that the "relatively high center of gravity of the loaded coal wagons" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) was a factor that contributed to the derailment. Although the loading was within permissible limits, the high center of gravity made the wagons more susceptible to destabilizing forces, such as those experienced during dynamic interaction (3.19).
- name: Organizational Practices
  explanation: Organizational practices encompass the policies, procedures, and decision-making processes within an organization that can impact safety. In this case, a suggestion from the operations department to prevent heavier trains from using the crossing loop was not adopted (3.33). This decision allowed the existing system to continue, which contributed to the circumstances leading to the derailment. KiwiRail has since implemented the suggestion to improve safety (3.34).
- name: Equipment Performance
  explanation: Equipment performance relates to the functioning and reliability of the hardware used in operations, such as wagons and bogies. The wagons and bogies involved in the accident were overrepresented in KiwiRail's derailment statistics (3.29-3.30). However, the investigation did not find evidence that the equipment contributed to the accident (3.31). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining equipment to ensure it does not pose a safety risk, even though in this instance, it was not a contributing factor to the derailment.
