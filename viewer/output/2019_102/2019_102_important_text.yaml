  \ train is a serious event and has the potential to cause \nsignificant damage and\
  \ injury.  Derailments do therefore have significant implications for \ntransport\
  \ safety.  Following this derailment two of the derailed wagon s passed over a \n\
  level crossing, potentially creating a significant risk to the public waiting for\
  \ the train to \ncross.  \n3.2. The following analysis discusses the possible factors\
  \ that contributed either directly or \nindirectly to the derailment, and the factors\
  \ th at were evaluated and found to be non -\ncontributory.  \nFactors contributing\
  \ to the derailment  \n3.3. Train derailments can be caused by a single factor or\
  \ a combination of factors that may \ninclude track condition, rolling stock condition\
  \ and train handling.  \n3.4. The Co mmission found that it was very likely the\
  \ excessive speed, combined with a track \ntwist that was within code and the high\
  \ centre of gravity of the load on the derailed \nwagons  that led to the derailment\
  \ . In the past the Commission has investigated a series \nof derailments similar\
  \ to this incident, the latest one being rail inquiry RO -2012 -103.  The \nreport\
  \ highlighted the effect of a phenomenon known as dynamic interaction.  Dynamic\
  \ \ninteraction was very likely the cause of this derailment.  It has been describ\
  \ ed in previous \nreports and is worthy of repetition;  \nA train derailment attributed\
  \ to dynamic interaction occurs when the \ntrack geometry, wagon condition, wagon\
  \ loading and train speed are \nindividually within tolerance limits, or marginally\
  \ in excess, but not to an \nextent that each variation on its own is sufficient\
  \ to be a prime cause of \nthe derailment. However, when in combination these conditions\
  \ can \nresult in a derailment.  \nSpeed  \n3.5. An examination of the train's on\
  \ -board Tranzlog data recorder showed the p osition of \nthe train controls and\
  \ speed of the train as it exited the crossing loop at Clinton.   \n3.6. The data\
  \ recorder showed that as the train  exited the crossing loop it accelerated to\
  \ a \nspeed of 21 km/h , slightly  below  the maximum  permissible  crossing loop\
  \  exit speed of \n25 km/h .  However, the train reached 31 km/h when it  was allowed\
  \ to coast13 while the \ndriver checked the paperwork for the northbound journey\
  \ to Dunedin.  \n3.7. When the train exited the Clinton loop, heading north towards\
  \ Dunedin, it was running \non a section of the main line that had a downhill gradient\
  \ of 1:65.  Once the locomotives \nhad cleared the level crossing the train was\
  \ put into coast and travelled under its own \nmomentum.  The downhill track gradient\
  \ then provided favourable conditions for t he \ntrain to accelerate slowly.   \n\
  \                                                        \n13 Movement when no power\
  \ or braking is applied and the train is allowed to continue under its own \nmomentum.\
  \  \n \n \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final report RO -2019 -102 3.8. At the same time as\
  \ the train started to accelerate the driver took the opportunity to \nread the\
  \ relevant route paperwork associated with the journey to Dunedin.  With the \n\
  driver's attention now focused on reading the paperw ork the train continued to\
  \ \naccelerate. The remainder of the train was still exiting the Clinton loop and\
  \ as the \nwagons progressively joined the main line, they added momentum.  \n3.9.\
  \ The first indication the driver had that something was wrong was when the train\
  \ \nemergency brake automatically applied.  The data recorder showed that at the\
  \ time the \nbrake was applied the speed of the train had risen to 37 km/h.  \n\
  3.10. When the first of the last three wagons derailed leaving the crossing loop,\
  \ the train \nspeed was recorded a t 34 km/h, which was 9 km/h or 36% over the maximum\
  \ \npermissible line speed at the crossing loop.   \n3.11. The investigation found\
  \ that the forces created by excessive speed while the wagons \nwere passing over\
  \ a curved section of track w ere a contributory factor t o the derailment \nand\
  \ part of the phenomenon known as dynamic interaction.  \n3.12. The driver chose\
  \ to check the route paperwork, which is a normal train -driving task, while \n\
  the train was still leaving the crossing loop.  It was a critical time when it was\
  \ essent ial to \ncontrol the train speed on a downhill gradient through low speed\
  \ points.  The driver's \ndistraction was not deliberate, but it does demonstrate\
  \ the ease with which a momentary \ndistraction can lead to unintentional consequences.\
  \  \nTrack condition  \n3.13. Witnes s marks confirmed that the point of derailment\
  \ (see Figure 5) was on the left -hand \nrail in the direction of travel, betwee\
  \ n 7B and 7A points (see Figure 2), a section of track \nthat was still within\
  \ the crossing l oop (see Figure 8).  \n  \n \nFinal report RO -2019 -102 \n<< Page\
  \ 9 >>\n  \nFigure 8: Point of derailment  \n3.14. It can be seen from Figure 6\
  \ that the manual measurement of track geometry post -\naccident identified a track\
  \ twist just before the point of derailment.  The twist was just \nwithin KiwiRail's\
  \ tolerance limits and was not co nsidered severe enough to have caused \nthe derailment\
  \ directly.  \n3.15. The effect of a track twist in relation to derailment is for\
  \ the twist to start a rocking \nmotion, of the wagons particularly.  When the cause\
  \ of derailment is considered in terms \nof dynamic in teraction, it is very likely\
  \ that a rocking motion on the wagons created by \nthe track twist was a contributory\
  \ factor but was not sufficient in itself to have caused the \nderailment.   \n\
  Centre of gravity  of the loaded coal wagons  \n3.16. The higher the centre of gra\
  \ vity of a loaded coal wagon, the greater the destabilising \neffect of any lateral\
  \ force acting on the wagon, such as centripetal force, created when a \nwagon is\
  \ following a curve in a track.  In a worst -case scenario the lateral force may\
  \ \ncause the centre of  gravity to move beyond the pivot point (see Figure 9) and\
  \ become \nunstable.  A part -filled coal wagon, with a much lower centre of gravity\
  \ than a full coal \nwagon, will require a greater lateral force to move the centre\
  \ of gravity beyond the pivot \npoint for  it to become unstable.  \n\n \n \n\n\
  << Page 10 >>\n Final report RO -2019 -102  \nFigure 9: Effect of centre of gravity\
  \ on stability  \n3.17. By design, the coal wagons that were involved in the accident\
  \ had, at maximum capacity, \na centre of gravity of 1,849 mm above rail level.\
  \  The maximum pe rmissible centre of \ngravity is 2,000 mm above rail level.  The\
  \ loading of the coal wagons involved in this \nderailment was below the maximum\
  \ permissible and therefore within tolerance.   \n3.18. The relatively high centre\
  \ of gravity of the loaded coal wagons was wi thin permissible \nlimits and is not\
  \ considered to have caused the derailment by itself.  When considering \nthe effect\
  \ of a lateral force being applied to the centre of gravity of a loaded wagon, \n\
  such as centripetal force generated by travelling around a curv e or a rolling motion\
  \ force \ngenerated by a track twist, the overall effect will be to destabilise\
  \ the wagon.   \n3.19. It is considered likely that in this derailment, once a lateral\
  \ force was applied, the high \ncentre of gravity of the wagons and the resulting\
  \ red uced stability further contributed to \nthe overall effect of dynamic interaction.\
  \   \nMechanism of derailment  \n3.20. The Commission has previously investigated\
  \ derailments that have involved the \nphenomenon of dynamic interaction .  These\
  \ reports  includ e rail inquiry  RO-2007 -10214 \nand RO -2012 -10315. \n3.21.\
  \ In this derailment the dynamic interaction of speed, track geometry and reduced\
  \ stability \ncaused by the high centre of gravity of the load very likely led to\
  \ a wagon  oscillating \nfrom side to side , creating the ideal condition s for\
  \ wheel climb16 to occur .  When viewed \nin the direction of travel , the oscillating\
  \ motion very likely  resulted in the outer left -hand \nwheel  of the rear bogie\
  \  of the first wagon derail ing and  climb ing up onto the top of the \nrail head\
  \ . \n                                                        \n14 Rail inquiry\
  \ RO2007 -102 freig ht train main line derailments, various locations on the national\
  \ rail \nnetwork.  \n15 Rail inquiry RO2012 -103 derailment of freight Train  229\
  \ Rangitawa -Maewa . \n16 When the lateral force on a rail wheel flange exceeds\
  \ the downwards force (axle load).  There shoul d \nbe twice as much downward force\
  \ holding the wheel to the rail as lateral force to prevent the wheel \nclimbing\
  \ up onto the top of the rail.  \n\n \nFinal report RO -2019 -102 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\
  \ 3.22. The wheel then cont inued to travel along the top of the rail for approximately\
  \ five \nmetres.  The wheel flange created witness marks on the rail head before\
  \ it dropped off \nthe outside edge of the rail. The subsequent effect was that\
  \ a further two wagons \nderailed until the las t wagon parted from the train, severing\
  \ the air supply and \nautomatically applying the train brakes.  \nNon-contributing\
  \ factors  \n3.23. The Commission examined several other factors but determined\
  \ that they were not \ncontributory to the derailment.  \nFatigue  \n3.24. While\
  \ many shift workers tend to sleep directly before a nightshift and utilise the\
  \ time \nafter the shift for normal daily activities, this driver retired to bed\
  \ immediately after a \nnightshift, slept for seven hours and then woke nine hours\
  \ before the next nightshift to \nundertake normal daily activities before starting\
  \ work.  \n3.25. This could be considered an unusual sequence of work, relax and\
  \ sleep.  However, it was \nthe driver's usual routine and the driver's roster provided\
  \ ample opportunity between \nshifts for adequate re st and recovery.  There were\
  \ no indications that driver fatigue \nplayed a part in this derailment.    \nLoading\
  \  \n3.26. The process used for loading the coal wagons was carefully examined to\
  \ see if it was \npossible to overload the coal containers or to load them with\
  \ a significant weight bias \nfront to back or left to right, which could contribute\
  \ to the instability of a wagon.   \n3.27. Coal was loaded into each coal container\
  \ with a front loader excavator fitted with a \nweight -monitoring system, allowing\
  \ the operator to fill t he containers to capacity \naccurately.  The container\
  \ was clearly marked internally with a maximum capacity line \nand the loading company\
  \ had robust documented procedures in place to manage the \nloading process.  \n\
  3.28. The Commission found that the coal loading proc ess and weight distribution\
  \ were \nunlikely to have contributed to the derailment.  \nRolling stock  \n3.29.\
  \ The three wagons that derailed, carrying a total of six coal containers, were\
  \ UKK class \nwagons. The bogies fitted to them were standard Type 14.  Both the\
  \ class of wagon and \nthe type of bogie are overrepresented in KiwiRail's derailment\
  \ statistics.   \n3.30. Type 14 bogies represent approximately 40% of rail traffic\
  \ (based on kilometres \ntravelled) but were involved in 80% of (8 out of 10) derailments\
  \ in 2018.  UKK wagons \nmake up around 12% of rail traffic but featured in 70%\
  \ (7 out of 10) of these derailments.   \n3.31. However, the systematic, detailed\
  \ examination of the bogies did not reveal anything out \nof tolerance or identify\
  \ any parts that were unfit for purpose.  The Commis sion found no \nevidence to\
  \ suggest that the Type 14 bogies or the wagon design contributed to the \naccident.\
  \  \n \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2019 -102 Previous derailment at the\
  \ Clinton crossing loop  \n3.32. This incident was effectively a repeat of the derailment\
  \ in 2016, which was not \ninvestigated by the Commission.  The actions taken in\
  \ response to that accident had \nincluded track repair and crossing loop exit speed\
  \ monitoring.   \n3.33. Post the 2016 investigation by KiwiRail, there was a suggestion\
  \ from the operations \ndepartment to prevent the heavier train usi ng the crossing\
  \ loop.  This would have meant \nthat coal -laden trains bound for Dunedin would\
  \ always use the main line to pass an \nopposing train at Clinton.  The empty coal\
  \ wagon trains bound for Invercargill would \ntherefore use the crossing loop and\
  \ would b enefit from the uphill gradient assisting to \nkeep the train speed down.\
  \  \n3.34. Unfortunately this suggestion was not adopted and therefore the existing\
  \ system \ncontinued.  KiwiRail has now adopted the idea and formally implemented\
  \ it; see section \n7 of this report .\n \nFinal report RO -2019 -102 \n<< Page\
