2016_101,033/17,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail liaise with Greater Wellington Regional Council to develop a long-term strategy for the metropolitan rail system, with a view to identifying and addressing the current safety issues with the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station area.","There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited available space makes the track layout congested. The existing layout means there are fewer safety overlaps designed into this area and fewer fail-safe back-up systems in place in the event of a driver failing to stop at a red light.

Any increases in commuter train services into and out of Wellington through this tight track layout increases the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increases the underlying risk of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights.
To decongest and modernise the track and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will require significant resources, which is unlikely to occur in the near future. 
However, there will likely be future increases in rail patronage and the system is already congested.

2016_101,034/17,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer-term solution can be made.,"There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station, such as:
- providing better recognition of signals
- standard procedures for signalling trains through the area
- better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.

This incident has shown that more work is required of KiwiRail to further reduce the likelihood of trains colliding within the Wellington Station area.
