  \ discusses the circumstances that resulted in the relay train pass ing \nsignal\
  \ 100  when it was at Red Stop and setting up a potential collision with the departing\
  \ Upper \nHutt service . \n4.1.2.  The analysis also discusses the followin g safety\
  \ issues, identified during  the inquiry : \n\uF0B7 there is  a heightened risk\
  \ of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington \nStation because limited\
  \ space makes  the track layout congested  \n\uF0B7 there are a number of reasonable\
  \ measures that had not been  taken to further \nreduce the risk of trains colliding\
  \ on the approaches to Wellington Station, such as : \nproviding better recognition\
  \ of signals; standard procedures for signalling trains \nthrough the area; and\
  \ better communication between train drivers and persons \ncontrolling the trains\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the standard of n on-technical  skills (NTS) , form erly known as Crew\
  \ Resou rce \nManagement , between the driver , the TXO and the signaller were ineffective.\
  \  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  There had been  no radio communication between\
  \  the signaller  and the relay driver before the \nrelay train  departed Platform\
  \ 7 .  He was unaware of what other train movements were \nhappening at t he time.\
  \  He just knew what the  destination  for his train was and departed the \nplatform\
  \ in accordance with the signal.  The  signal was at that time showing Yellow over\
  \ Red, \nwhich meant that the next signal ahead ( signal 100) was displaying Red.\
  \ \n4.2.2.  The next sig nal ahead was displaying Red because the sig naller had\
  \ set a route for the Upper \nHutt train, which would cross ahead of the relay train.\
  \  The cross -over point was approximately \n43 m  ahead of signal 100 which was\
  \ showing Red. \n4.2.3.  In line with  signal 100 , on the opposite side of the\
  \ track,  was signal 99.  The signaller had pre -\nset signal 99 to Green in anticipation\
  \ of routing the Waikanae train that was  still sitting at \nPlatform 8 taking passengers\
  \ on board.  \n4.2.4.  Instead of stopping his train at the Red signal 100 on his\
  \ left, the driver of the relay train \nmistook the Green signal 99 on his right\
  \ as being for his train and continued pas t it.  Both \nsignals had a placard with\
  \ a white arrow on a black background pointing towards the track to \nwhich they\
  \ applied  (see Figure 4) .  However, the arrow s are not illuminated or reflective\
  \ and are \ndifficult to see in the dark and the rain.  \n4.2.5.  Additionally,\
  \ the signal required to get from the platform to the storage yard would be a 'Red\
  \ \nover Red light with a Low Speed Yellow light ', so the driver should not have\
  \ taken a 'Green \nProceed ' indication on either signal (see Figure 10).   \n\n\
  << Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO -2016 -101  \nFigure 10 \nA low speed light below\
  \ two Red lights  \n4.2.6.  The driver quickly realised his error and stopped his\
  \ train 12 m short of the cross -over point s, \nthereby narrowly averting a collision\
  \ w ith the Upper Hutt train, which passed through the cross -\nover 13 seconds\
  \ later.  \n4.2.7.  No conversation is reported to have taken place between the\
  \ relay driver and the TXO once in \nthe cab  of the relay train , so the TXO 's\
  \ presence  in the cab  did not directly contribute to the \nincident .  While in\
  \ the cab, the TXO could have helped prevent the incident  had he been calling \n\
  the signals . \n4.2.8.  The relay train driver had completed similar relay movements\
  \ before and was familiar with the \nsignals that were applicable to th e possible\
  \  route s.  Evidence of this was his immediate \nrecogni tion of his error as he\
  \ passed the Red signal.   \n4.2.9.  In human factor terms the driver's mistake\
  \ is considered a lapse, possibly attributable to him \nbeing past the end of his\
  \ shift late at night, with a less heightened sense of awareness because \nhe was\
  \ performi ng the additional task of storing  an empty train for the night.  \n\
  4.2.10.  The incident highlights the importance of having checks or defences in\
  \ a system to counteract \nthe known risk of human error.  This is di scussed in\
  \ more detail in the following sections.  \n4.3. Suitab ility of the track layout\
  \ facilitating a modern timetable  \nSafety issue - There is a heightened risk of\
  \ trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington \nStation because limited\
  \ space mak es the track layout congested . \n4.3.1.  The track layout and associated\
  \ control system between Wellington Station platforms, and the \nlines into and\
  \ out of Wellington and those to the surrounding storage yards or maintenance \n\
  depots, have remain ed relatively unchanged since 1937  (see Appendix 2) .  \n4.3.2.\
  \  The c ontrol of the various signals and points in this area is achieved by operating\
  \ the  lever \nmechanism s inside the Wellington Signalbox .  Mechanical interlocks7\
  \ prevent the signaller from \nbeing able to se t conflicting train movements. \
  \ \n4.3.3.  A number  of signals  and points around New Zealand are controlled via\
  \ Computer Based \nInterlocking  from the National Train Control Centre  within\
  \ Wellington Station .  This system links \nsignals and points by using software\
  \ interlocking to prevent possible conflicting train \n                        \
  \                                \n7 Interlocking is an arrangement of  signal apparatus\
  \ tha t prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of \ntracks such as\
  \ at junctions or crossings.  \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2016 -101 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\
  \ movem ents.  Computer Based Interlocking  allows complex logic to be implemented,\
  \ whereas \nthis is considerably more difficult  for lever and relay based interlocking\
  \ . \n4.3.4.  The Wellington Signalbox  controlled area is based on 1930s ' vintage\
  \ signalling principles and \nthe associated interlocking is appropriate for a lever\
  \ based system of this vintage, and remains \nfit for purpose , although it does\
  \ not meet modern design standards8. The fundamental \nprinciples are the same as\
  \ those deploy ed today with the exception that more modern computer \nbased interlocking\
  \ equipment allows more complex logic to be developed.   The existing layout \n\
  means there are no safety  overlaps9 designed into this area and few fail -safe\
  \ back -up systems \nin place in the event of a SPAD.  The current  system is highly\
  \ reliant on drivers always stopping \nat a Red light.  \n4.3.5.  However, c hanging\
  \ control of the area from the Wellington Signalbox to a National Train Control\
  \ \nCentre  would not have prevented thi s incident.  The issue is with the congested\
  \ layout of the \ntrack and signalling system . \n4.3.6.  Any increases in commuter\
  \ train services into and out of Wellington through this tight track \nlayout increases\
  \ the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increase s the underlying risk\
  \ \nof relying on train drivers to stop at Red lights.  \n4.3.7.  Between the 2001/\
  \ 02 and 2015/16 financial years there has been a 26% increase in \npatronage on\
  \ the Wellington commuter network (see Figure 11).  To meet this demand there \n\
  has to be  a corresponding increase in the length of trains or an increased service\
  \ frequency, \nwhich has  therefore increas ed the pressure on this congested  area.\
  \  \n4.3.8.  Using longer trains to accommodate an increase in patronage does not\
  \ increase  the likelihood  \nof collisions , but the potential consequence is elevated.\
  \  Alternatively , a more frequent service \nmeans the likelihood  of collisions\
  \  is increase d, but the potential consequence is not. \n \nFigure 11 \nAnnual\
  \ patronage Wellington rail commuter  networ k \n4.3.9.  Compar ing the relatively\
  \ modern 2010 Britomart Auckland  design  to the 1930s '-design ed \nWellington\
  \ Signalbox controlled area shows some similarities and differences between the\
  \ two .  \nBoth are terminating station s and have the highest patronage in their\
  \ respective areas.  \n4.3.10.  Operationally , Britomart Auckland has five platforms\
  \ fed from two tracks compared to \nWellington 's four tracks fe eding nine platform\
  \ s.  Additionally , Britomart has maintenance \ndepots located some distance away,\
  \ there are no requirement s for relays, the signals and \n                    \
  \                                    \n8 Modern design features could include safety\
  \ overlaps, Automatic Train Protection and the European Train \nControl System.\
  \  \n9 Safety overlap  is the distance beyond a signal that is still considered\
  \ to be part of the track before the signal , and is the \nsafety buffer in which\
  \ a SPAD train could stop where no other train should be.  \n - 2,000,000 4,000,000\

  \ Report RO -2016 -101 points  are controlled by the computerised  Train Control\
  \ system, safety overlaps are built in, and \nthe European Train Control System\
  \ (ETCS )10 is installed , which can moderate train speeds \napproaching signals\
  \ and automatically apply train brakes in the event of a SPAD.  \n4.3.11.  By contrast\
  \ , in Wellington the passenger train and freight maintenance depots are both located\
  \ \nwithin the Wellington Signalbox controlled area.  Relays are required from platform\
  \ -to-platform, \nand into and out of the storage yards  or maintenance depots,\
  \ with all movements controlled by \nthe electro -mechanical system in the signalbox.\
  \  To install an ETCS  type system in Wellington a \nsubstantial  remodel of the\
  \ current layout to facilitate the required safety overlaps  would  be \nrequired\
  \ . See Appendix 3 for  a tabular comparison between Auckland Britomart and the\
  \ \nWellington Signalbox controlled area s. \n4.3.12.  Currently, Greater Wellington\
  \ Regional Council, in partnership with KiwiRail and Transdev , has \ndeveloped\
  \ and maintain s a Wellington Network Management Plan.  This is a three -yearly\
  \ \ndocument used for budgeting and operational delivery within a 10 -year planning\
  \ period.  The \ncurrent planned signalling work programme addresses reliability\
  \ issues and life -expired \nequipment . \n4.3.13.  Decongest ing and modernis ing\
  \ the track and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will \nrequire significant\
  \ resources, and is unlikely to occur in the near future.  However, with the \n\
  increasing rail patronage and a  corresponding capacity -increase demand , the Commission\
  \ is \nrecommending that KiwiRail and Greater Wellington Regional Council develop\
  \ a long -term \nstrategy for the metropolitan rail system , with a view to addressing\
  \ the issues described above.  \nMeanwhile, there is a need to further mitigate\
  \ the r isks that the current system poses , and t his \nissue is discussed in the\
  \ following sections . \n4.4. Risk management  \nSafety issue - There are a number\
  \ of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further \nreduce the risk of\
  \ trains colliding withi n the approaches  to Wellington Station, such as : \nproviding\
  \ better recognition of signals; standard procedures for signalling trains through\
  \ the \narea; and better communication between train drivers and persons controlling\
  \ the trains.  \nSignalling procedures  \n4.4.1.  One way to reduce  the risk of\
  \ trains colliding in the Wellington Station area is to develop \nsignalling procedures\
  \ that could reduce the number of potential conflicts or points of possible \nconfusion\
  \ for drivers.  \n4.4.2.  For example, the  advantage in pre -setting signal  99\
  \ to Green f or the Waikanae bound train , so \nthat only one lever movement was\
  \ required to  release the Waikanae service for the whole \nmovement  out of the\
  \ Wellington Station  area , was offset by the increased risk of the relay train\
  \ \ndriver confusing it as his signal .  Signal 99 was the signal that the relay\
  \ train driver mistook as \napplying to his train.  \n4.4.3.  Another example is\
  \ the relay train being signalled to depart the platform, knowing that it would\
  \ \nlikely only travel 150 m before needing to stop at signal 100 to allow  the\
  \ passage of the Upper \nHutt train through the cross -over.  In this scenario,\
  \ probably the safest solution  would have \nbeen to keep the relay train at its\
  \ platform until the Upper Hutt train had cleared the section, \nthereby eliminat\
  \ ing the potential for c onflict.  \n4.4.4.  It had become accepted practice for\
  \ signallers to advance trains the short distance from the \nplatforms up to signals\
  \  held at red.  T his helps clear trains  from the platforms more quickly and \n\
  therefore contributes to keep ing services on schedule  at peak service times .\
  \  This incident \noccurred shortly after midnight, during a quiet period with fewer\
  \ trains operating.  While there \nmay be marginal time gains in some cases , such\
  \ gains a re likely to be offset by there being few \ntechnical interventions for\
  \  preventing collisions should a driver fail to stop at a Red signal.  \n     \
  \                                                   \n10 The ETCS alerts drivers\
  \ to the status of signals  ahead, moderates approach speeds automatically for specific\
  \ locations , \nand automatically applies train brakes in a SPAD ( it does not prevent\
  \ SPADs but minimises the possible distance of a \nSPAD) . \n \nFinal Report RO\
  \ -2016 -101 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.4.5.  It had also become  accepted practice for\
  \ signallers to pre-set part of the route ahead for a \nservice and hold the train\
  \ at the platform on  a Red signal to help spread the signaller 's \nworkload .\
  \  \n4.4.6.  KiwiRail had  no written guidelines, instructions or procedures on\
  \ how early  a signaller  can pre-\nset part of the route prior to a planned departure\
  \ . \n4.4.7.  Without procedures or guidelines , signallers can achieve the same\
  \ movement multiple different \nways .  There  is therefore a lack of consistency\
  \  about  how signalle rs should  signal and route  a \ngiven  movement . \nCommunication\
  \  \n4.4.8.  Good positive communication is the key to safe operational transport\
  \ systems,  and train \noperation is no different from other modes of transport.\
  \  As mentioned earlier, the relay train \ndriver boarded his train and moved off\
  \ with no knowledge of what other movements might be \naffecting the movement of\
  \ his train  or what the route to his destination would be . \n4.4.9.  The holding\
  \ of a relay at the platform with a Red signal until the driver is on board and\
  \ ready to \ndepart would ensure the driver would need to call the signaller to\
  \ request a light to depart.  This \nwould give the signaller the opportunity to\
  \ confirm with the driver his train's destina tion, the \nroute it will take and\
  \ any priority constraints .  In this case, if it was deemed necessary to move \n\
  the relay train off the platform  and up to signal  100, typical information could\
  \ read 'cleared to \ndepart Platform 7 for the yard in accordance with  signals\
  \  - likely  hold at signal 100 for passage \nof the Upper Hutt Service departing\
  \ Platform 5 '.  Such communication would put the driver on \nalert that there was\
  \ a conflicting movement in parallel and crossing his train.  \n4.4.10.  KiwiRail's\
  \ 'Local Instructions - Operating Procedures Tranz Metro Wellington' (Rev 9 dated\
  \ \n2/9/15) document states in section '5.4 Platform/Platform Relays':  \nBefore\
  \ taking a relay movement from the platform, the Locomotive Engineer must call A\
  \ Box for the intended \nmovement . \nIt is unclear why th ere is a  requirement\
  \ for a driver to interact with the signaller only for  \nplatform -to-platform\
  \ relays and not for all relay train or unusual train movements . \n4.4.11.  The\
  \ TXO was sitting in the driving cab of the relay train  for operational reasons\
  \ .  He was allowed \nto be there provided he was directly involved in matters related\
  \ to the running of the train.  The \nTXO was trained and experienced  in the various\
  \ routes and signals within the Wellin gton Station \narea.  There was a lost  opportunity\
  \ for him  to work with the driver by calling the relevant signals \nalong the route.\
  \  It is feasible that had he been doing so, he would have prompted the driver to\
  \ \nfocus on the correct signal , thereby averting the incident.  \n4.4.12.  Finally,\
  \ when the signaller realised there  had been a SPAD , his spontaneous  reaction\
  \ was to \nwave out of the window of the Wellington Signalbox to try and attract\
  \ the attention of the relay \ntrain driver in the dark and rain .  A more eff ective\
  \  way to have communicated the problem \nwould have been to use the available radio\
  \ and call 'stop, stop, stop ', thereby stopping both \ntrains . \nSignal definition\
  \  \n4.4.13.  The potential for a driver to confuse  signals 99 and 100 was partially\
  \ address ed in 2005 by the \naddition of non -reflective arrows  on the signal\
  \ poles , pointing to the respective track the signal \nis controlling  (see Figure\
  \ 12).  The arrows are e ffective  during daylight hours , but  they are not \n\
  illuminated or reflective  and are difficult to see at night . \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n\
  \ Final Report RO -2016 -101  \nFigure 12 \nTrack indication  arrows  \n4.4.14.\
  \  In Figure 12, signal 100 controls the track depicted by the green  arrow, which\
  \ is the track the \nrelay train was travelling on .  Signal 99 controls the track\
  \ to the right depicted by the yellow  \narrow, which was the track  the Waikanae\
  \  bound train was  scheduled to travel on . \n4.4.15.  Illuminating the arrows\
  \ may have assisted the relay train driver in recognising which of the two \nsignals\
  \ applied to his train. The Commission has recommended that  the Chief Executive\
  \ of \nKiwiRail  conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities\
  \ they can to \nreduce the risk of unsafe train operations in the area . \n4.4.16.\
  \  In an automatic signalling area  like Wellington Station , if a train passes\
  \ a  Red signal  the \nsurrounding signals governi ng potential conflicting mov\
  \ ements automatically change to Red as \na safety feature.  This happens because\
  \ the rogue  train has occupied  an unauthorised section \nof track beyond the Red\
  \ signal , which then  activates the associated track circuits  to change all \n\
  other signals to Red to  prevent a potential collision . \n4.4.17.  In this section\
  \  of Wellington Station the complexity of possible movements and the congested\
  \ \nnature  of the area mean that the insulated joint11 where the track circuit\
  \ detection happens i s \nnot directly adjacent to signal 100.  The relay train\
  \ proceeded 30 m pas t signal 100 and \nstopped 1 m short  of the insulated joint\
  \ .  Consequently,  the signals for the Upper Hutt bound \ntrain remained Green\
  \ even though the relay train had passed the Red signal by 30 m.  \n4.4.18.  To\
  \ allow simultaneous parallel train movements through  adjacent sets of point on\
  \ adjacent \nlines with the relatively simple electro -mechanical logic system in\
  \ the existing Wellington \nSignalbox, sections of track have been li nked to form\
  \ zone s (see Figure 1 3).  This limits the \nsensitivity of the system  and was\
  \ the reason why the insulated joint was not located \nimmediate ly adjacent to\
  \ signal 100 . \n                                                        \n11 An\
  \ insulated joint separates two adjacent pieces of rail t rack so that sensors can\
  \ detect when a train moves from one \nsection across the insulated joint to the\
  \ other piece of track.  \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2016 -101 \n<< Page 15 >>\n  \n\
  Figure 13 \nPossible parallel movements and associated track zones  \n4.4.19.  This\
  \ meant that the signal for the Upper Hutt service , displaying a 'Green - Proceed'\
  \ indication , \ndid not revert to 'All Red - Stop' despite the incursion of the\
  \ relay movement towards the same \nconvergence of points.  It is debatable whether\
  \  the Upper Hutt  service would have had time to \nstop before colliding with the\
  \ relay train if the relay had continued into the conflict area .  \nHowever, had\
  \ the signals for the Upper Hutt bound train reverted to Red as soon as the relay\
  \ \ntrain passed the Red signal 100, the  driver of the Upper Hutt bound train would\
  \ have had more \nopportunity to slow  his train before both trains reached the\
  \ convergence point s. \n4.4.20.  A number of key signals in the Wellington Station\
  \ area are fitted with signal trips12 (see Figure \n14).  However, t here  are no\
  \ automatic signal trips fitted to signals 99, 100 or 101 , which would \nautomatically\
  \ engage the train brakes in the event of a SPAD .  The reason given for signal\
  \ trips \nnot being fitted to these signals is  that the  signals  are too close\
  \ to the conflict zone for a train to \nstop before it occupies the points area.\
  \  However, in this case the driver was able to stop his \ntrain just short of the\
  \ conflict zone and avoid a potential collision.  There may therefore be some \n\
  safety benefi t from having such devices installed in some cases.  \n          \
  \                                              \n12 A signal trip is an arm which\
  \ automatically raises when a signal is at 'All Red - Stop' .  It catches on the\
  \ brake trip lever \nmount ed low on the side of a train and automatically applies\
  \ the train brakes if the train passes a signal at  red. \n\n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\

  \ that  the current mitigation actions against  train collisions and minimising\
  \ \ndamage to passengers and rolling stock in the event of a collision in this area\
  \ are: \n\uF0B7 for the driver to always stop at an 'All Red - Stop' signal  \n\uF0B7\

  \ compartment  in the event of a train -to-train \nimpact. \nOnly one of the three\
  \ measures would actually prevent a collision, and that measure relies \nsolely\
  \ on human performance.  The other two measures do not  preven t collision s, but\
  \ minimis e \nthe consequences instead .   \n4.4.22.  There have been 10 recorded\
  \ relay movem ent SPADs within the Wellington Signalbox controlled \narea  between\
  \ Jan uary 2006 and May 2016 , so this area could  be considered a relatively high\
  \ -\nSPAD and high -risk area .  This incident has shown that more work is required\
  \ by KiwiRail  to \nreduce the risk of train collisions within the Wellington Station\
  \ area .  The Commission is \nrecommending that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail\
