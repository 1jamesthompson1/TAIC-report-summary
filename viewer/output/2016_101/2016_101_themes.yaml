- name: Ineffective Non-Technical Skills (NTS)
  explanation: Non-Technical Skills (NTS), formerly known as Crew Resource Management, refer to the cognitive, social, and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance. In the context of this accident, the NTS between the driver, the Train Examiner Officer (TXO), and the signaller were ineffective, as there was no communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed, and no conversation reported between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train ("there had been no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed Platform 7" (4.2.1), "No conversation is reported to have taken place between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train" (4.2.7)). This lack of communication and coordination could have contributed to the driver's error and the near-miss incident.
- name: Signal Recognition and Visibility
  explanation: Signal recognition and visibility are crucial for train drivers to make correct decisions. In this incident, the driver mistook a green signal meant for another train as his own due to the non-illuminated and non-reflective arrows on the signals, which were difficult to see in the dark and rain ("Instead of stopping his train at the Red signal 100 on his left, the driver of the relay train mistook the Green signal 99 on his right as being for his train" (4.2.4), "the arrows are not illuminated or reflective and are difficult to see in the dark and the rain" (4.2.4)). This indicates that the signal visibility was not adequate under all operating conditions, leading to the potential for misinterpretation and accidents.
- name: Congested Track Layout
  explanation: The congested track layout near Wellington Station increases the risk of train collisions due to limited space and a complex track layout that has remained relatively unchanged since 1937 ("there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested" (4.1.2), "The track layout and associated control system between Wellington Station platforms, and the lines into and out of Wellington and those to the surrounding storage yards or maintenance depots, have remained relatively unchanged since 1937" (4.3.1)). This outdated and congested layout contributes to the risk of accidents, as it complicates train movements and signal interpretation.
- name: Lack of Modern Safety Systems
  explanation: The absence of modern safety systems such as Automatic Train Protection or the European Train Control System (ETCS) in the Wellington area means that the system is highly reliant on drivers always stopping at a red light, without additional technological safeguards to prevent collisions ("the existing layout means there are no safety overlaps designed into this area and few fail-safe back-up systems in place in the event of a spad" (4.3.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The Wellington Signalbox controlled area is based on 1930s' vintage signalling principles" (4.3.4)). This reliance on human performance without modern safety systems increases the risk of accidents due to human error.
- name: Inconsistent Signalling Procedures
  explanation: Inconsistent signalling procedures can lead to confusion and errors by train drivers. In this case, there were no written guidelines or procedures on how early a signaller can preset part of the route prior to a planned departure, leading to a lack of consistency in how signallers should signal and route a given movement ("kiwirail had no written guidelines, instructions or procedures on how early a signaller can preset part of the route prior to a planned departure" (4.4.6 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "Without procedures or guidelines, signallers can achieve the same movement multiple different ways" (4.4.7)). This lack of standardization can create situations where drivers are unsure of the correct signals, increasing the risk of accidents.
- name: Inadequate Risk Mitigation Measures
  explanation: The measures in place to mitigate the risk of trains colliding in the Wellington Station area did not reduce the risk as far as reasonably practicable. The system relied on drivers stopping at red signals without sufficient checks or defenses to prevent collisions in case of human error ("train drivers failing to stop their trains at red signals is a known and foreseeable risk. there should therefore have been checks or defenses built into the system" (5.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), "The measures relied on to mitigate the risk of trains colliding in the Wellington Station area did not reduce the risk as far as reasonably practicable" (5.4)). This indicates that the existing risk mitigation strategies were insufficient to address the known risks adequately.
