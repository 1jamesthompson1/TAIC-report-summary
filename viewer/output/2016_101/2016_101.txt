The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport  Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a standing Commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the cir cumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a pers on or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. Shortly after midnight o n Saturday 28 May 2016 , an empty passenger  train was being  moved  
from Platform 7 at Wellington Railway Station (Wellington Station) to the West Storage Yard for 
overnight storage .  At about the same time a passenger train with 79 passengers on board 
departed from  Platform 5  bound for Upper Hutt .  Their respective  routes would cross within a 
short distance from the platforms.  It was dark and raining.  
1.2. The signal box controll er had set a clear ( Green) route for the Upper Hutt train and had set a 
Red Stop signal to hold the empty train just short of the cross -over point until the Upper Hutt 
train had cleared that section of track.  
1.3. However, there was another signal showing Green , adjacent to the Red sig nal meant for the 
empty train.  The driver confused the two signals , and thinking the Green signal  was meant for 
his train, he continued past the Red signal towards the cross -over point.  
1.4. The driver realised his mistake just as his driving cab passed between the Red and Green 
signals and immediately stopped his train just 12 metres short of the cross -over point.  The 
Upper Hutt train passed through the cross -over 13 seconds later.  Both tra ins were restricted to 
a maximum speed of 20 kilometres  per hour.  There was no collision and nobody was injured.  
1.5. Noting that t rain drivers failing to stop their trains at Red signals is a kno wn and foreseeable 
risk, the Commission found  that there should have been more checks or defences built into the 
system to prevent this near collision when the driver confused the two signals.  
1.6. The Commission also found  that due to the  geographically constrained  and congested nature of 
the Wellington Station area , there  are fewer fail -safe back -up systems tha n would normally be 
associated with a modern track and signalling system.  Consequently, there is an elevated risk 
of trains colliding in the area that will need to be managed now and in future.  
1.7. Safety issues  identif ied during the inquiry included:  
 the heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
because limited space makes the track layout congested  
 a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of tra ins 
colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station .  These include the provision of 
providing better recognition of signals , standard procedures for signalling trains through 
the area , and better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the 
trains  
1.8. The Commission  refers to a previous recommendation  to address issues with communication , 
and makes two new recommendations  to address immediate and long -term solutions for 
managing the risk in the Wellington Station area.  
1.9. Key safety lesson s arising from this incident  are that: 
 all safety -critical  systems should have checks and defences designed into them that 
mitigate against  human error resulting in incidents or accidents  
 there should be sufficient clear and concise communication between persons 
responsible for controlling trains and train drivers so that all parties are aware of the 
situation and alert to any threats to safe train operations.

 Final Report RO -2016 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry   
2.1. The incident occurred at 0007 on Saturday 28 May 2016 .  The NZ Transport Agency notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) soon after the incident 
occurred.   The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport A ccident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 to determine the circumstances and causes of the 
occurrence and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. The Commission investigators travelled to Wellington Station on Monday 30  May to commence 
the site investigation .   
2.3. On 10 June , Commission investigators, KiwiRail and representatives from NZ  Transport Agency , 
re-enact ed the incident  under controlled conditions .  Two Matangi trains depart ed from 
Platform s 7 and 5  of Wellington Station .  The front of the simulated rela y4 train was stopped on 
the paint mark made after the incident, and the simulated Upper Hutt train was stopped across 
the points in front of the relay train .  Measurements and photo graph s were taken to determine 
the relative positions of the two trains.  
2.4. Commission  investigators interviewed the:  
 relay train drive r 
 Train Examiner Operations ( TXO) who accompanied the relay driver in the cab at the 
time of the incident  
 driver of the Upper Hutt service  
 signalman on duty at the time of the incident  
 KiwiRail’s sig nalling engineers . 
2.5. The C ommission obtained the following documents and records for analysis , including : 
 closed -circuit television recordings from the cameras  on board the relay and Upper 
Hutt trains  
 signals data from the Wellington Station signalling system  
 training records and medical details  
 KiwiRail’s Crew Res ource Management document ation  
 historical signal passed at danger ( SPAD ) data for the Wellington Station area  
 roster details for the relay driver  
 Tranzlog5 data from both the relay train and the Upper Hutt service train  
 KiwiRail signalling design and operation principles documents  
 the Commission request ed the recordings of the Wellington Signalbox  Channel 1 
radio communications for the time period of this in cident but the radio recording 
system had not been functional at the time . 
2.6. On 27 September 2017 , the Commissioners considered a draft repor t and approved it to be 
sent to  interested persons for consultation.   
2.7. The Commission received submissions from five interested persons and these were considered 
in the preparation of the final repor t. 
2.8. On 13 December 2017, the Commission approved the publication of its final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The train storage yard and the train maintenance facilit ies are close to Wellington Station.  
Consequently , the track layout with the required cross -over points between the main lines on 
the approaches to the station are congested due to the  limited area available.  The close 
proximity of the train storage yard and train maintenance facility contribute to  a high  number of 
train ‘relay’ movements passing through this congested area.  
3.1.2.  The majority of r elay movements around  Wellington Station are empty train movements  into 
and out of the train storage  yard to facilit ate the demands of peak and off -peak times .  
However , other types of relays include moving trains from one platform to another, taking a 
train into or out of a maintenance  facility , or taking the train through the automatic train wash 
system.  
3.1.3.  This incident  involved an empty train that was being moved from Platform 7 into the train 
storage yard for the night ( route depicted in green on Figure 2 below) . 
 
Figure 2 
Diagram  of planned  train movement s 
3.1.4.  Around th e same  time as the relay movement, an Upper Hutt service (depicted in blue on Figure 
2 above) was scheduled to leave Platform 5 at 0005 for the Up Main , passing ahead of the 
relay train.  Also a Waikanae service (depicted in yellow on Figure 2 above) was scheduled  to 
depart Platform 8 at 0014 for the Middle Main , by which time the relay should have been 
completed . 
3.1.5.  The trains were all being controlled by a signalbox controller (the signaller) from the Wellington 
Signal box, locally know as ‘A Box ’ (depicted in red on Figur e 2 above) . 
 
  


<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -101 3.2. Narrative   
3.2.1.  A driver who had just completed his shift was asked to drive a relay train to the train storage 
yard. This type of request  was not unusual and the driver c ould say no without repercussion .  
Just after  midnight  on 28 May , the driver and a TXO boarded the relay train .  The TXO was 
present to set the manual points into the storage yard.  Once in the driving cab the TXO took the 
left-hand seat but played no part in the relay train movement.  
3.2.2.  It was dark at the time and light r ain was falling.  The driver was using the windscreen wipers on 
the train , which he reported were working well . 
3.2.3.  The signaller had pre -set the signals for all three trains departing Wellington.  For the Upper 
Hutt service from Platform 5 all signals were se t to ‘Green – Proceed’  to the Up Main.  The Relay 
was signalled to leave Platform 7 with a ‘Yellow – Caution -to-Stop’ signal while the next signal 
(100) was set to ‘All Red – Stop’.  The Waikanae service was held on Platform  8 by an ‘All Red – 
Stop’ signal , but the next signal (99) was pre-set to ‘Green – Proceed’ with its route indicator 
displaying ‘M’ for the Middle Main (see Figure 3).  
 
Figure 3 
Signal set -up for signals 99 and 100 that the relay driver saw  
(for full image of signal set -up for all three trains see Appendix 1 ) 
3.2.4.  The rel ay departed from Platform 7 authorised by the signal displaying a ‘Yellow over Red – 
Caution -to-Stop’ indica tion.  This meant  the next signal at that time was  set at ‘All Red – Stop’ . 
3.2.5.  Within seconds  of the relay departing the platform, the passenger service destined for Upper 
Hutt departed  Platform 5 with 79 passengers on board.  
3.2.6.  At 0007 , the relay approached signal 100 on the left -hand side  of the track, which was still  
displaying an ‘All Red – Stop’ indication .   However,  signal 99 on the right -hand side of the track 
was displaying a ‘Green – Proceed’ indication .  Although it had  a route indicator displaying an 
‘M’ for the Middle Main , the relay driver mistook the signal  on his right to be  for h is relay and 

 
Final Report RO -2016 -101 
<< Page 5 >>
 did not stop his train, passing signal 100 at  ‘All Red – Stop’  (see Figure 4) .  Passing a signal 
displaying this indication is classed as a SPAD A6 (signal passed at danger category A). 
 
Figure 4 
Signal 100 (left) and  99 (right) as seen by the relay driver  
 
3.2.7.  The relay driver realised his mistake as he drew level with the ‘Stop’ signal and applied the train 
brakes, bringing the relay movement to a full stop 30 metres (m) beyond the signal.  
3.2.8.  Simultaneously , the signaller noticed that the relay train had passed the signal at ‘Stop’  and 
waved vigorously  out of the window in an attempt to get the relay movement to stop.  
3.2.9.  The Upper Hutt service crossed through the set of points directly in front of the relay train 13 
seconds a fter it had stopped.   (see Figure 5)  
3.2.10.  The distance between the relay train and the passing Upper Hutt service was 12 m.  
3.2.11.  The incident was reported to Train Control and the driver was relieved of the relay train and 
taken fo r drug and alcohol testing .
                                                        
6 SPAD means passing a STOP signal without authorisation.  A ‘SPAD A’ is passing a perfectly displayed STOP signal 
without authorisation.

 3.3. Personnel  information  
3.3.1.  Both the relay and Upper Hutt service drivers, plus the signaller and TXO , were all certified for  
their respective roles at the time of the incident.  
3.3.2.  The relay driver had been certified to drive Matangi units 12 months prior to the incident.  
3.3.3.  The relay driver was not familiar with the Wellington driver adage used by some that is ‘left 
leaving  – right arriving ’.  This means  that when leaving Wellington Station  the signals for the 
route will be on the left -hand side of the track , and w hen arriving into Wellington the signals are 
on the right -hand side of the track .  However, when leaving platform 7 both signals 99 and 100 
appear from the left hand side of the driver until approximately 30 m away , when it becomes 
clear the train will pass between the two signals and signal 100 is on the left hand side of the 
train.  
3.3.4.  The signaller had a total of 41 years’ experience  in Wellington rail, completing the last 11 years 
as a signaller in Wellington Signalbox, after four years as a signaller in Taita Signalbox.  
3.3.5.  Following the incident, the relay driver underwent a KiwiRail post -incident drug and alcohol test, 
which returned a negative (clear) result.  
3.4. Track layout  
3.4.1.  The signals between Wellington Station through to Ngāūranga  are manually controlled from the 
Wellington Signalbox known locally as A Box .  
3.4.2.  Part of the track layout just north of Wellington Station is congested  due to  a lack of available 
land (see Figure 6 ), There are multiple sets of points and possible direction or track changes 
available over a short distance.

 Final Report RO -2016 -101 3.4.3.  The track  layout and  its associated signalling system was originally built in 1937 .  A number of  
improvements to the track and signalling infrastructure have been made over time , including : 
 the upgrading of individual signals from the older searchlight ty pe to mode rn LEDs (light -
emitting diodes) (see Figure 7 ) 
 
Figure 7 
Old searchlight vs modern LED signals  
 the placement of route indicators (see Figure 8) to Directing Signals in the area to identity 
the route which has been set, indicated b y illuminated characters

Route Indicator  
 the addition of non -reflective white arrows to the uprights of signals 99 and 100  in 2005, 
to assist drivers to identify which signal is controlling which track  
 the introduction of a third bi -directional main line into and out of Welli ngton in July 2010 
(see Figure 9) to improve flexibility into and out of Wellington Statio n.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The following  analysis discusses the circumstances that resulted in the relay train pass ing 
signal 100  when it was at Red Stop and setting up a potential collision with the departing Upper 
Hutt service . 
4.1.2.  The analysis also discusses the followin g safety issues, identified during  the inquiry :

controlling the trains  
 the standard of n on-technical  skills (NTS) , form erly known as Crew Resou rce 
Management , between the driver , the TXO and the signaller were ineffective.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  There had been  no radio communication between  the signaller  and the relay driver before the 
relay train  departed Platform 7 .  He was unaware of what other train movements were 
happening at t he time.  He just knew what the  destination  for his train was and departed the 
platform in accordance with the signal.  The  signal was at that time showing Yellow over Red, 
which meant that the next signal ahead ( signal 100) was displaying Red. 
4.2.2.  The next sig nal ahead was displaying Red because the sig naller had set a route for the Upper 
Hutt train, which would cross ahead of the relay train.  The cross -over point was approximately 
43 m  ahead of signal 100 which was showing Red. 
4.2.3.  In line with  signal 100 , on the opposite side of the track,  was signal 99.  The signaller had pre -
set signal 99 to Green in anticipation of routing the Waikanae train that was  still sitting at 
Platform 8 taking passengers on board.  
4.2.4.  Instead of stopping his train at the Red signal 100 on his left, the driver of the relay train 
mistook the Green signal 99 on his right as being for his train and continued pas t it.  Both 
signals had a placard with a white arrow on a black background pointing towards the track to 
which they applied  (see Figure 4) .  However, the arrow s are not illuminated or reflective and are 
difficult to see in the dark and the rain.  
4.2.5.  Additionally, the signal required to get from the platform to the storage yard would be a ‘Red 
over Red light with a Low Speed Yellow light ’, so the driver should not have taken a ‘Green 
Proceed ’ indication on either signal (see Figure 10).

 Final Report RO -2016 -101  
Figure 10 
A low speed light below two Red lights  
4.2.6.  The driver quickly realised his error and stopped his train 12 m short of the cross -over point s, 
thereby narrowly averting a collision w ith the Upper Hutt train, which passed through the cross -
over 13 seconds later.  
4.2.7.  No conversation is reported to have taken place between the relay driver and the TXO once in 
the cab  of the relay train , so the TXO ’s presence  in the cab  did not directly contribute to the 
incident .  While in the cab, the TXO could have helped prevent the incident  had he been calling 
the signals . 
4.2.8.  The relay train driver had completed similar relay movements before and was familiar with the 
signals that were applicable to th e possible  route s.  Evidence of this was his immediate 
recogni tion of his error as he passed the Red signal.   
4.2.9.  In human factor terms the driver’s mistake is considered a lapse, possibly attributable to him 
being past the end of his shift late at night, with a less heightened sense of awareness because 
he was performi ng the additional task of storing  an empty train for the night.  
4.2.10.  The incident highlights the importance of having checks or defences in a system to counteract 
the known risk of human error.  This is di scussed in more detail in the following sections.  
4.3. Suitab ility of the track layout facilitating a modern timetable  
Safety issue – There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington 
Station because limited space mak es the track layout congested . 
4.3.1.  The track layout and associated control system between Wellington Station platforms, and the 
lines into and out of Wellington and those to the surrounding storage yards or maintenance 
depots, have remain ed relatively unchanged since 1937  (see Appendix 2) .  
4.3.2.  The c ontrol of the various signals and points in this area is achieved by operating the  lever 
mechanism s inside the Wellington Signalbox .  Mechanical interlocks7 prevent the signaller from 
being able to se t conflicting train movements.  
4.3.3.  A number  of signals  and points around New Zealand are controlled via Computer Based 
Interlocking  from the National Train Control Centre  within Wellington Station .  This system links 
signals and points by using software interlocking to prevent possible conflicting train 
                                                        
7 Interlocking is an arrangement of  signal apparatus tha t prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of 
tracks such as at junctions or crossings.  

 
Final Report RO -2016 -101 
<< Page 11 >>
 movem ents.  Computer Based Interlocking  allows complex logic to be implemented, whereas 
this is considerably more difficult  for lever and relay based interlocking . 
4.3.4.  The Wellington Signalbox  controlled area is based on 1930s ’ vintage signalling principles and 
the associated interlocking is appropriate for a lever based system of this vintage, and remains 
fit for purpose , although it does not meet modern design standards8. The fundamental 
principles are the same as those deploy ed today with the exception that more modern computer 
based interlocking equipment allows more complex logic to be developed.   The existing layout 
means there are no safety  overlaps9 designed into this area and few fail -safe back -up systems 
in place in the event of a SPAD.  The current  system is highly reliant on drivers always stopping 
at a Red light.  
4.3.5.  However, c hanging control of the area from the Wellington Signalbox to a National Train Control 
Centre  would not have prevented thi s incident.  The issue is with the congested layout of the 
track and signalling system . 
4.3.6.  Any increases in commuter train services into and out of Wellington through this tight track 
layout increases the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increase s the underlying risk 
of relying on train drivers to stop at Red lights.  
4.3.7.  Between the 2001/ 02 and 2015/16 financial years there has been a 26% increase in 
patronage on the Wellington commuter network (see Figure 11).  To meet this demand there 
has to be  a corresponding increase in the length of trains or an increased service frequency, 
which has  therefore increas ed the pressure on this congested  area.  
4.3.8.  Using longer trains to accommodate an increase in patronage does not increase  the likelihood  
of collisions , but the potential consequence is elevated.  Alternatively , a more frequent service 
means the likelihood  of collisions  is increase d, but the potential consequence is not.

4.3.9.  Compar ing the relatively modern 2010 Britomart Auckland  design  to the 1930s ’-design ed 
Wellington Signalbox controlled area shows some similarities and differences between the two .  
Both are terminating station s and have the highest patronage in their respective areas.  
4.3.10.  Operationally , Britomart Auckland has five platforms fed from two tracks compared to 
Wellington ’s four tracks fe eding nine platform s.  Additionally , Britomart has maintenance 
depots located some distance away, there are no requirement s for relays, the signals and 
                                                        
8 Modern design features could include safety overlaps, Automatic Train Protection and the European Train 
Control System.  
9 Safety overlap  is the distance beyond a signal that is still considered to be part of the track before the signal , and is the 
safety buffer in which a SPAD train could stop where no other train should be.

 Final Report RO -2016 -101 points  are controlled by the computerised  Train Control system, safety overlaps are built in, and 
the European Train Control System (ETCS )10 is installed , which can moderate train speeds 
approaching signals and automatically apply train brakes in the event of a SPAD.  
4.3.11.  By contrast , in Wellington the passenger train and freight maintenance depots are both located 
within the Wellington Signalbox controlled area.  Relays are required from platform -to-platform, 
and into and out of the storage yards  or maintenance depots, with all movements controlled by 
the electro -mechanical system in the signalbox.  To install an ETCS  type system in Wellington a 
substantial  remodel of the current layout to facilitate the required safety overlaps  would  be 
required . See Appendix 3 for  a tabular comparison between Auckland Britomart and the 
Wellington Signalbox controlled area s. 
4.3.12.  Currently, Greater Wellington Regional Council, in partnership with KiwiRail and Transdev , has 
developed and maintain s a Wellington Network Management Plan.  This is a three -yearly 
document used for budgeting and operational delivery within a 10 -year planning period.  The 
current planned signalling work programme addresses reliability issues and life -expired 
equipment . 
4.3.13.  Decongest ing and modernis ing the track and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will 
require significant resources, and is unlikely to occur in the near future.  However, with the 
increasing rail patronage and a  corresponding capacity -increase demand , the Commission is 
recommending that KiwiRail and Greater Wellington Regional Council develop a long -term 
strategy for the metropolitan rail system , with a view to addressing the issues described above.  
Meanwhile, there is a need to further mitigate the r isks that the current system poses , and t his 
issue is discussed in the following sections . 
4.4. Risk management  
Safety issue – There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further 
reduce the risk of trains colliding withi n the approaches  to Wellington Station, such as : 
providing better recognition of signals; standard procedures for signalling trains through the 
area; and better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.  
Signalling procedures  
4.4.1.  One way to reduce  the risk of trains colliding in the Wellington Station area is to develop 
signalling procedures that could reduce the number of potential conflicts or points of possible 
confusion for drivers.  
4.4.2.  For example, the  advantage in pre -setting signal  99 to Green f or the Waikanae bound train , so 
that only one lever movement was required to  release the Waikanae service for the whole 
movement  out of the Wellington Station  area , was offset by the increased risk of the relay train 
driver confusing it as his signal .  Signal 99 was the signal that the relay train driver mistook as 
applying to his train.  
4.4.3.  Another example is the relay train being signalled to depart the platform, knowing that it would 
likely only travel 150 m before needing to stop at signal 100 to allow  the passage of the Upper 
Hutt train through the cross -over.  In this scenario, probably the safest solution  would have 
been to keep the relay train at its platform until the Upper Hutt train had cleared the section, 
thereby eliminat ing the potential for c onflict.  
4.4.4.  It had become accepted practice for signallers to advance trains the short distance from the 
platforms up to signals  held at red.  T his helps clear trains  from the platforms more quickly and 
therefore contributes to keep ing services on schedule  at peak service times .  This incident 
occurred shortly after midnight, during a quiet period with fewer trains operating.  While there 
may be marginal time gains in some cases , such gains a re likely to be offset by there being few 
technical interventions for  preventing collisions should a driver fail to stop at a Red signal.  
                                                        
10 The ETCS alerts drivers to the status of signals  ahead, moderates approach speeds automatically for specific locations , 
and automatically applies train brakes in a SPAD ( it does not prevent SPADs but minimises the possible distance of a 
SPAD) . 
 
Final Report RO -2016 -101 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.4.5.  It had also become  accepted practice for signallers to pre-set part of the route ahead for a 
service and hold the train at the platform on  a Red signal to help spread the signaller ’s 
workload .  
4.4.6.  KiwiRail had  no written guidelines, instructions or procedures on how early  a signaller  can pre-
set part of the route prior to a planned departure . 
4.4.7.  Without procedures or guidelines , signallers can achieve the same movement multiple different 
ways .  There  is therefore a lack of consistency  about  how signalle rs should  signal and route  a 
given  movement . 
Communication  
4.4.8.  Good positive communication is the key to safe operational transport systems,  and train 
operation is no different from other modes of transport.  As mentioned earlier, the relay train 
driver boarded his train and moved off with no knowledge of what other movements might be 
affecting the movement of his train  or what the route to his destination would be . 
4.4.9.  The holding of a relay at the platform with a Red signal until the driver is on board and ready to 
depart would ensure the driver would need to call the signaller to request a light to depart.  This 
would give the signaller the opportunity to confirm with the driver his train’s destina tion, the 
route it will take and any priority constraints .  In this case, if it was deemed necessary to move 
the relay train off the platform  and up to signal  100, typical information could read ‘cleared to 
depart Platform 7 for the yard in accordance with  signals  – likely  hold at signal 100 for passage 
of the Upper Hutt Service departing Platform 5 ’.  Such communication would put the driver on 
alert that there was a conflicting movement in parallel and crossing his train.  
4.4.10.  KiwiRail’s ‘Local Instructions – Operating Procedures Tranz Metro Wellington’ (Rev 9 dated 
2/9/15) document states in section ‘5.4 Platform/Platform Relays’:  
Before taking a relay movement from the platform, the Locomotive Engineer must call A Box for the intended 
movement . 
It is unclear why th ere is a  requirement for a driver to interact with the signaller only for  
platform -to-platform relays and not for all relay train or unusual train movements . 
4.4.11.  The TXO was sitting in the driving cab of the relay train  for operational reasons .  He was allowed 
to be there provided he was directly involved in matters related to the running of the train.  The 
TXO was trained and experienced  in the various routes and signals within the Wellin gton Station 
area.  There was a lost  opportunity for him  to work with the driver by calling the relevant signals 
along the route.  It is feasible that had he been doing so, he would have prompted the driver to 
focus on the correct signal , thereby averting the incident.  
4.4.12.  Finally, when the signaller realised there  had been a SPAD , his spontaneous  reaction was to 
wave out of the window of the Wellington Signalbox to try and attract the attention of the relay 
train driver in the dark and rain .  A more eff ective  way to have communicated the problem 
would have been to use the available radio and call ‘stop, stop, stop ’, thereby stopping both 
trains . 
Signal definition  
4.4.13.  The potential for a driver to confuse  signals 99 and 100 was partially address ed in 2005 by the 
addition of non -reflective arrows  on the signal poles , pointing to the respective track the signal 
is controlling  (see Figure 12).  The arrows are e ffective  during daylight hours , but  they are not 
illuminated or reflective  and are difficult to see at night . 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -101  
Figure 12 
Track indication  arrows  
4.4.14.  In Figure 12, signal 100 controls the track depicted by the green  arrow, which is the track the 
relay train was travelling on .  Signal 99 controls the track to the right depicted by the yellow  
arrow, which was the track  the Waikanae  bound train was  scheduled to travel on . 
4.4.15.  Illuminating the arrows may have assisted the relay train driver in recognising which of the two 
signals applied to his train. The Commission has recommended that  the Chief Executive of 
KiwiRail  conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities they can to 
reduce the risk of unsafe train operations in the area . 
4.4.16.  In an automatic signalling area  like Wellington Station , if a train passes a  Red signal  the 
surrounding signals governi ng potential conflicting mov ements automatically change to Red as 
a safety feature.  This happens because the rogue  train has occupied  an unauthorised section 
of track beyond the Red signal , which then  activates the associated track circuits  to change all 
other signals to Red to  prevent a potential collision . 
4.4.17.  In this section  of Wellington Station the complexity of possible movements and the congested 
nature  of the area mean that the insulated joint11 where the track circuit detection happens i s 
not directly adjacent to signal 100.  The relay train proceeded 30 m pas t signal 100 and 
stopped 1 m short  of the insulated joint .  Consequently,  the signals for the Upper Hutt bound 
train remained Green even though the relay train had passed the Red signal by 30 m.  
4.4.18.  To allow simultaneous parallel train movements through  adjacent sets of point on adjacent 
lines with the relatively simple electro -mechanical logic system in the existing Wellington 
Signalbox, sections of track have been li nked to form zone s (see Figure 1 3).  This limits the 
sensitivity of the system  and was the reason why the insulated joint was not located 
immediate ly adjacent to signal 100 . 
                                                        
11 An insulated joint separates two adjacent pieces of rail t rack so that sensors can detect when a train moves from one 
section across the insulated joint to the other piece of track.

Figure 13 
Possible parallel movements and associated track zones  
4.4.19.  This meant that the signal for the Upper Hutt service , displaying a ‘Green – Proceed’ indication , 
did not revert to ‘All Red – Stop’ despite the incursion of the relay movement towards the same 
convergence of points.  It is debatable whether  the Upper Hutt  service would have had time to 
stop before colliding with the relay train if the relay had continued into the conflict area .  
However, had the signals for the Upper Hutt bound train reverted to Red as soon as the relay 
train passed the Red signal 100, the  driver of the Upper Hutt bound train would have had more 
opportunity to slow  his train before both trains reached the convergence point s. 
4.4.20.  A number of key signals in the Wellington Station area are fitted with signal trips12 (see Figure 
14).  However, t here  are no automatic signal trips fitted to signals 99, 100 or 101 , which would 
automatically engage the train brakes in the event of a SPAD .  The reason given for signal trips 
not being fitted to these signals is  that the  signals  are too close to the conflict zone for a train to 
stop before it occupies the points area.  However, in this case the driver was able to stop his 
train just short of the conflict zone and avoid a potential collision.  There may therefore be some 
safety benefi t from having such devices installed in some cases.  
                                                        
12 A signal trip is an arm which automatically raises when a signal is at ‘All Red – Stop’ .  It catches on the brake trip lever 
mount ed low on the side of a train and automatically applies the train brakes if the train passes a signal at  red.

 Final Report RO -2016 -101  
Figure 14 
A signal trip installed at Signal 39 (left) and the brake trip lever on a Matangi train (right)  
4.4.21.  KiwiRail has said that  the current mitigation actions against  train collisions and minimising 
damage to passengers and rolling stock in the event of a collision in this area are: 
 for the driver to always stop at an ‘All Red – Stop’ signal  
 a 20 kilometre -per-hour  speed restriction in the area to ensure any collision is at a 
relatively low speed  
 the crashworthiness of the various train vehicle designs to minimise impact damage 
and vehicle incursion into the passenger compartment  in the event of a train -to-train 
impact. 
Only one of the three measures would actually prevent a collision, and that measure relies 
solely on human performance.  The other two measures do not  preven t collision s, but minimis e 
the consequences instead .   
4.4.22.  There have been 10 recorded relay movem ent SPADs within the Wellington Signalbox controlled 
area  between Jan uary 2006 and May 2016 , so this area could  be considered a relatively high -
SPAD and high -risk area .  This incident has shown that more work is required by KiwiRail  to 
reduce the risk of train collisions within the Wellington Station area .  The Commission is 
recommending that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail liaise with Greater Wellington Regional 
Council to develop a long -term strategy for the metropolitan rail syste m, with a view to 
identifying and addressing the current safety issues with the track and signalling infrastructure 
in the Wellington Station area .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The empty relay train passed a signal at  Red (Stop) and nearly collided with  a loaded passenger 
train because  the driver of the relay train mistakenly thought  a Green signal that was adjacent 
to his Red signal was applicable to his train . 
5.2. Train drivers failing to stop their trains at Red signals is a known and foreseeable risk.  There  
should therefore have been check s or defence s built into the system to prevent this near  
collision when  the driver confused the two signals.  
5.3. The congested nature of the Wellington Station track layout  means there are fewer fail-safe 
back -up systems than would nor mally be associated with a modern track and signalling system.  
Consequently, there is an elevated risk of trains colliding  in the area  that will need to be 
managed in future . 
5.4. The measures relied on to mitigate the risk of trains colliding in the Wellingto n Station area did 
not reduce the risk as far as reasonably practicable . 
5.5. Better communication and sharing of information between the signaller who was controlling the 
trains and the train drivers involved could have prevented the incident occurring.

General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified by the 
Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation; and  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that would 
not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
 KiwiRail held  a Signal’s Sighting Committee r eview of signal s in this A Box controlled area  
(see Appendix 4)  
 Transdev Wellington has: 
o undertaken some re training of the relay driver   
o added the relay dr iver to the ‘at-risk register ’ for increased frequency of safety 
observations and supervision  
o reminded  all staff of the requirements of Rule 117  (October 2017 staff briefing – 
see Appendix 5).

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recom mendations have been issued to Kiw iRail, with notice of these 
recommendations given to  Greater Wellington Regional Council, New Zealand Transport Agency 
and Transdev Wellington . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that th ese recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Previous r ecommendations  to the NZ Transport Agency  
7.3. Good positive communication is key to the safety of the train operations.  In this  case, the relay 
train driver boarded his train and moved off with no knowledge of what other movements might 
be affecting the movement of his train.   This incident emphasises how important NTSs are in 
preventing incidents and accidents . 
In 2012, as part of Inquiry RO 2011 -101, the Commission issued a recommendation (002/12) 
to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that he require : the Executive of the National 
Rail System Standards (NRSS) to develop standards to ensure all rail participants meet a 
consistently high level of Crew Resource Management (now NTS) ; and communication to staff 
which  includes the use of standard rail phraseology.  
On 31 March 2017, the NZ Transport Agency updated the Commission  as follows : 
It is noted that the Commission is sued its most recent recommendation on non -
technical skills to the Transport Agency in 2012 and that this is still open. The 
recommendation required that the practice of non -technical skills be recognised in 
the National Rail System Standards. The Transpor t Agency continues to work with 
KiwiRail on this issue, and in December 2016 issued a Safety Improvement Plan 
Notice in accordance with section 36 of the Railways Act 2005 requiring KiwiRail to 
prepare a Safety Improvement Plan to address the implementatio n of non -technical 
skills into its rail operations.   
On 1 November 2017, the NZ Transport Agency updated the Commission as follows:  
The Transport Agency approved KiwiRail’s Safety Improvement Plan regarding non -
technical skills in April 2017. In their most  recent update on the Non –Technical 
Skills project KiwiRail reported that the project is on time, within budget and meeting 
the project specifications. As of 13 October 2017, the Transport Agency has also 
agreed to the integration of stabilised approach an d risk -triggered commentary 
driving into the scope of the Safety Improvement Plan requirements.    
Recommendations  made to KiwiRail   
7.4. There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
because limited available space makes the track layout congested.   The existing layout means 
there are few er safety overlaps  designed into this area and few er fail-safe back -up systems  in 
place in the event of a driver failing to stop at a red light.  
Any increases in commuter train servi ces into and out of Wellington through this tight track 
layout increases the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increases the underlying risk 
of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights . 
To decongest and modernise the track and signal infr astructure at Wellington Station will 
require significant resources, which is unlikely to occur in the near future.  However, the re will 
likely be future increase s in rail patronage and the system is already congested . 
 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -101 On 15 December  2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail 
liaise with Greater Wellington Regional Council to develop a long -term strategy for the 
metropolitan rail system , with a view to identifying and addressing the current  safety  issues with 
the track and signal ling infrastructure in the Wellington Station area .  [033/17] 
7.4.1.  On 23 January 2018 , the Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied:  
KiwiRail accepts the recommendation as presented and will be engaging with the 
Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) for develop ing a long -term strategy for 
improving the safety of the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington 
Station area.  
7.5. There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk 
of trains colliding within the approac hes to Wellington Station, such as : 
 providing better recognition of signals  
 standard procedures for signalling trains through the area  
 better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains . 
This incident has shown that more work is required of KiwiRail to further reduce the likelihood  
of train s colliding within the Wellington Station area.  
On 15 December  2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail 
conduct a review of  current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce 
the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer -term solution can be made .  
[034/17] 
7.5.2.  On 23 January 2018 , the Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied , in part : 
KiwiRail, GWRC and Transdev Wellington already co -operate closely on operating and 
strategic matters.  This is required by the Wellington Network Agreement and is 
supported by an MOU between the three organisations.  
KiwiRail  are in agreement to conduct a review of current arrangements in order to try 
to identify opportuniites for attempting to reduce the risk to train operations in the
