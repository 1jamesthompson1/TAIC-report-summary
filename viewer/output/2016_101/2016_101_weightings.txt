This indicates that fatigue and reduced alertness likely played a role in the incident.
","0.0","20.0","The analysis identified ineffective non-technical skills (NTS) between the driver, the TXO, and the signaller (4.1.2). There was ""no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed"" (4.2.1), and ""no conversation is reported to have taken place between the relay driver and the TXO once in the cab of the relay train"" (4.2.7). Better communication could have prevented the incident (5.5).
","0.0","0.0","There is insufficient information in the document to suggest that a lack of training or preparedness for emergency procedures contributed to the incident.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not indicate that maintenance procedures and compliance were factors in the incident.
","0.0","0.0","Fire detection and suppression systems were not relevant to the incident described.
","0.0","10.0","The Wellington Signalbox controlled area is based on 1930s' vintage signalling principles and does not meet modern design standards, lacking safety overlaps and fail-safe backup systems (4.3.4). The system is ""highly reliant on drivers always stopping at a Red light"" (4.3.4), indicating a need for better safety management.
","0.0","15.0","The driver mistook the Green signal 99 for his train instead of the Red signal 100 (4.2.4). This indicates a lack of situational awareness, which was a contributing factor to the incident.
","0.0","10.0","The arrows on the signals are ""not illuminated or reflective and are difficult to see in the dark and the rain"" (4.2.4), which contributed to the driver's confusion. The signal layout and associated control system have remained relatively unchanged since 1937 (4.3.1), indicating that equipment design and specifications are outdated and contributed to the incident.
","0.0","10.0","The incident highlights the importance of having checks or defenses in a system to counteract the known risk of human error (4.2.10). The congested nature of the track layout and the lack of modern safety features indicate insufficient risk management (4.3.3-4.3.5).

","0.0","0.0","There is no mention of structural integrity or material fatigue contributing to the incident.
","0.0","15.0","The driver's error in mistaking the signal and the lack of effective error management systems contributed to the incident (4.2.4, 4.2.8, 4.2.10). The system's reliance on human performance without adequate checks or defenses indicates a need for better error management (4.4.22).
","0.0","5.0","The lack of written guidelines, instructions, or procedures for signallers (4.4.6) and the accepted practice of advancing trains to signals held at red without technical interventions (4.4.4) suggest organizational influences that did not prioritize safety as much as necessary.
