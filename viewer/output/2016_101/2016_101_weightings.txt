This suggests that fatigue may have played a role in the incident, but it was not the sole contributing factor.
","0.0","23.333","The driver of the relay train mistook the Green signal 99 for his train instead of the Red signal 100, which was a human error (4.2.4). Additionally, ""the driver quickly realised his error"" (4.2.6), indicating that he had made an incorrect assumption about the signal. This human error was a direct cause of the near-miss.
","5.774","6.667","The relay train driver had completed similar relay movements before and was familiar with the signals (4.2.8), suggesting that training and competency were not significant factors in the incident.
","2.887","1.667","There is no evidence in the document suggesting that a lack of training or familiarity with equipment contributed to the incident.
","2.887","10.0","The standard of non-technical skills (NTS), formerly known as Crew Resource Management, between the driver, the TXO, and the signaller were ineffective (4.1.2). The TXO's presence in the cab did not directly contribute to the incident, but ""could have helped prevent the incident had he been calling the signals"" (4.2.7).
","0.0","13.333","The relay train driver should not have taken a 'Green Proceed' indication on either signal (4.2.5), and there were no written guidelines, instructions, or procedures on how early a signaller can pre-set part of the route prior to a planned departure (4.4.6). The lack of adherence to safety procedures and the absence of clear guidelines contributed to the incident.
","2.887","8.333","The document does not explicitly discuss organizational safety culture, but the lack of effective non-technical skills and the absence of written guidelines suggest that safety culture may not have been sufficiently robust to prevent the incident.
","2.887","10.0","There were ""a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding"" (4.1.2), indicating that risk management and analysis were not adequately applied to prevent the incident.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that regulatory oversight and compliance were factors in the incident.
","0.0","8.333","The driver's lapse in situational awareness led to the confusion between the two signals (4.2.4). The driver's ability to quickly realize his error (4.2.6) indicates that situational awareness was momentarily lost but not entirely absent.

","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document suggesting that maintenance and inspection regimes contributed to the incident.
","0.0","3.333","The Wellington Signalbox controlled area is based on 1930s' vintage signalling principles (4.3.4), and the lack of modern automated safety features like the European Train Control System (ETCS) contributed to the incident (4.3.12).
","2.887","5.0","The arrows on the signals are ""not illuminated or reflective and are difficult to see in the dark and the rain"" (4.2.4), indicating that weather conditions played a role in the driver's ability to correctly identify the signal.
","0.0","5.0","There had been no radio communication between the signaller and the relay driver before the relay train departed (4.2.1), and the lack of communication contributed to the incident.
