- name: Pilot Impairment Due to Substance Use
  explanation: 'Pilot impairment due to substance use is a critical safety theme in this accident. The pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre, which was likely the result of recent use of cannabis shortly before the flight and longer-term use that redistributed into his blood after death ("the pilot had a post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre. This was likely the result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the flight (considered highly likely), and residual THC from his having ingested cannabis over a longer term that redistributed into his blood after he died" (5.9)). The possibility that the pilot''s performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded, and the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot ("The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot. The possibility that the pilot''s performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded" (5.10)).'
- name: Inadequate Regulatory Oversight
  explanation: Inadequate regulatory oversight is another significant safety theme. The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public ("The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public" (5.12)). This theme is relevant because the oversight did not effectively address the safety risks associated with commercial ballooning, which could have contributed to the accident.
- name: Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules
  explanation: Non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules, which showed a disregard for complying with the rules ("The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules. This was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way, but it did show a disregard for complying with the rules" (5.8)). Although it did not directly contribute to the accident, this non-compliance indicates a broader issue of adherence to safety regulations.
- name: Lack of Private Balloon Licence Requirements
  explanation: The lack of private balloon licence requirements is a safety theme because there is no requirement for private ballooning in New Zealand to hold a licence, which is at variance with International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines and those of other countries with similarly developed histories of ballooning ("It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge or medical certificate can take non-paying passengers for a balloon flight" (5.13)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the potential risks associated with unregulated private ballooning activities.
- name: Pilot's Decision-making and Judgement
  explanation: The pilot's decision-making and judgement is a central safety theme in this accident. The pilot made several errors in judgement, such as allowing the balloon to descend below the level of power lines and attempting to out-climb the power lines instead of initiating an emergency descent ("The pilot allowed the balloon to descend below the level of power lines surrounding a paddock in which he did not intend to land" (5.2), "the pilot exercised poor judgement by attempting to out-climb the power lines, and the balloon collided with them" (5.4)). These errors were critical in the sequence of events that led to the accident.
- name: Emergency Procedures and Equipment Knowledge
  explanation: Emergency procedures and equipment knowledge is a safety theme because the passengers were not briefed on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines, which could have been crucial in the event of the pilot's incapacitation ("a balloon pilot would not normally brief passengers on the emergency equipment available or how to operate the control lines" (4.5.7)). This theme is relevant as it pertains to the preparedness of passengers to respond to emergency situations, which could potentially mitigate the severity of an accident.
