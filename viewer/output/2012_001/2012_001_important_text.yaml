  \ rates as the worst  single New Zealand aviation accident since the loss of \n\
  a DC10 aeroplane on Mount Erebus, Antarctica in 1979.  As at January 2012, i t was\
  \ also the \nsecond  worst single hot-air balloon accident  on record in the world\
  \ .19 \n4.1.2.  The flight started as a routine adventure flight .  The weather\
  \ was suitable for the flight and the  \ntake-off and early stages of  the flight\
  \  appeared to run routinely .  Communications between the \npilot and the ground\
  \ crew w ere normal and no ne of the witnesses  noticed anything unusual \nuntil\
  \ the  pilot yelled out shortly before the balloon  struck the power lines .   \n\
  4.1.3.  The Commission found several areas for concern regarding the maintenance\
  \ of the balloon, \nbut it found no defect with the balloon that could have contributed\
  \ to the accident.  \n4.1.4.  Although there was no obvious defect that contributed\
  \ to the accident, the issue of balloon \nmaintenance standards and the regulatory\
  \ oversight of those standards was a safety issue.  \n4.1.5.  The CAA's sy stem\
  \ for handling reported ARCs was reviewed.   Two ARCs had been  lodged with \nthe\
  \ CAA : one about the pilot an d one about the maintenance of the balloon ZK -XXF.\
  \  The \nCommission was unable to determine if the accident would have been prevented\
  \ had  the CAA \nproperly followed up these 2 ARCs.   Nevertheless, proper follow\
  \ -up of ARCs is important, so \nthis safety issue is discussed also.   \n4.1.6.\
  \  The focus of the following discussion is on how the balloon came to be at low\
  \ level above the \nsilage paddock and what caused it t o strike the power line.\
  \  Pilot performance is central to \nthat discussion.  \n4.2. What happened  \n\
  Landing site  \n4.2.1.  The pilot had told his ground crew that the landing would\
  \ probably be in the Somerset Road \narea.  Th e predicted landing location  would\
  \  have been an estimate only .  In light wind \nconditions t he direction of the\
  \ wind , and therefore the balloon's track,  can vary significantly as \na balloon\
  \ descend s through the  levels .  This was the case on 7 January .  ZK-XXF approached\
  \ \nthe anticipated landing area initially in a south -east direction and then \
  \ began drifting  north -\neast across Somerset Road before changing direction again\
  \ to drift south -west over the silage \npaddock toward s Somerset Road .  The report\
  \ by one of the witnesses on Somerset Road of \n\"an isolated  gust of wind\" from\
  \ the north was consist ent with the flight path of the balloon \nchanging to a\
  \ more southerly direction towards the farm track and dual -voltage power lines.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  After entering  the silage paddock the balloon descended to a few metres\
  \ above the ground , \nwhich was just above the water spray  from the sprinkler\
  \ system .  However, this paddock was \nunlikely to have been the pilot's intended\
  \ landing area .  There are  4 reasons  for this : \n1 The basket was not orientated\
  \ for a landing  in the direction  in which  the balloon was \ntravelling.  The\
  \ landing side with the runners (support beams)  was nearly 180  degrees  out \n\
  from the direction of flight  as it initially crossed the paddock  in a south -west\
  \ direction .   \n2 There  were several rows of sprinklers operating in the silage\
  \ paddock and the pilot would \nhave been unlikely to want either the passengers\
  \ or the balloon to get wet.  \n3 The passengers were not in their braced landing\
  \ positions and were still leaning over the \nsides of the basket  as it crossed\
  \ the silage paddock . \n                                                      \
  \  \n19 On 13 August 1989, 13 people were killed after their  balloon collided with\
  \ another near Alice Springs, \nAustralia.  On 26 February 2013, 19 people were\
  \ killed when their balloon caught fire over Luxor, Egypt.  \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n\
  \ Final report 12 -001 4 The pilot had acknowledged the ground crew's report of\
  \ the horse in another  paddock \nover the road.  If the pilot had intended to land\
  \ in the silage  paddock, th at would have \nbeen the time  to inform the ground\
  \ crew.  \n4.2.3.  The flight to this stage had take n nearly 45 minutes , and based\
  \ on historical records there \nshould have been ample fuel remaining to continue\
  \ flying for another 45 minutes before low \nfuel quantity became  a concern . \
  \ There was also no rush to land at this time as there were \nsuitable landin g\
  \ paddocks immediately across Somerset R oad and farther on. \n4.2.4.  If the pilot\
  \ did not intend to land in the silage paddock , there is the question of why he\
  \ let the \nballoon descend to below the level of the dual -voltage power lines.\
  \  These power lines not only \nran adjacent to the balloon's initial path, but\
  \ also ran across the Somerset Road border of the \npaddock.  The balloon always\
  \ therefore needed to climb over them before crossing Somerset \nRoad in search\
  \ of a better landing site.  \n4.2.5.  The pilot may have wanted to s tay at low\
  \ level to land immediately after crossing Somerset \nRoad.  However, allowing the\
  \ balloon to descend below the level of the power lines was not \nsafe practice.\
  \  There is a possibility that the pilot was giving the passengers  the experience\
  \ of \nflying  at low level across the paddock, but again, to do so at such a low\
  \ level would not have \nbeen  safe practice .  In any event, there was no evidence\
  \ of any obvious concern or distress by \nthe pilot, passengers or ground crew while\
  \ the balloon was heading in a south -west direction \nacross the silage paddock.\
  \  \n4.2.6.  Until the balloon changed to a southerly direction there was probably\
  \ ample time for the pilot \nto climb the balloon  over the power lines running\
  \ along Somerset Road .  Once the direction \nchanged more southerly towards the\
  \ power lines running adjacent to the farm track, there was \nless distance and\
  \ time for the balloon  to out-climb them.  It was at about this time that \nwitnesses\
  \ reported hearing the sustained operat ion of the burners .  The first indicatio\
  \ n of \nanything untoward with the flight was when the pilot was heard telling\
  \  his passengers  to duck \ndown .  When exactly the pilot stopped the burners\
  \ could not be confirmed , but it was probably \njust before the basket came into\
  \ contact with the first wire  and before the pilot 's warning to \nhis passenge\
  \ rs, because w itnesses described hearing this warning clearly rather than over\
  \ the \nroar of the burners.  \nDid the pilot see the power line ? \n4.2.7.  Wires\
  \ generally and power lines in particular are a well  known hazard for a ircraft\
  \ operating at \nlow level s.  Studies show they are also the single biggest cause\
  \ of injury accidents involving  \nballoons.   The safety material available for\
  \ balloonists emphasises the danger of wires and is \nconsistent in the message\
  \ that wires must be avoided.  The flight manual for the Cameron \nA210 balloon\
  \ devoted a section to contact with power lines.   The pilot should also  have been\
  \ \ncautious of power lines , having been involved in  a wire strike some 12 years\
  \ previously .  \n4.2.8.  Wires can be difficult to detect, especially single and\
  \ small -diameter wires.  The dulling of \nwires from exposure to the elements,\
  \ certain lighting conditi ons and the presence of material \nsuch as lichen can\
  \ act to camouflage wires.  Figure 7 shows example s of a power line  viewed  \n\
  from 2 different angles and demonstrates the potential difficulty in seeing wires.\
  \  The poles, \nhowever, remain clearly visible.  \n  \nFinal report 12 -001 \n\
  << Page 31 >>\n  \n \nFigure 7 \nPower lines  \n4.2.9.  Balloon p ilots should be\
  \ aware of these factors and are taught to look for poles as an \nindication of\
  \ the presence of wires.  Once a wire is sighted, the pilot should maintain a safe\
  \ \nheight above it or, if at very low level, start a climb early enough to clear\
  \ the obstacle with a \ngood safety margin.  \n4.2.10.  The pilot of ZK -XXF was\
  \ familiar with the local area with its numerous power lines and had \nflown over\
  \ the power line he later struck  only 2 or 3 minutes earlier .  A photograph taken\
  \ by a \npassenger at the time clearly showed the power lines below the basket.\
  \  The pilot had an \nunobstructed view ahead and, while he may have been facing\
  \ away from the power line s when \nhe operated the burners, he only had to turn\
  \ slightly to see them . \n4.2.11.  The power line s, with their  6 wires and regularly\
  \ spaced poles , should have been easily visible \nto the pilot as he crossed the\
  \ silage paddock.   For this and other reason s given above, it is \nhighly likely\
  \ that the pilot kne w of and saw the power lines along the side and at the end\
  \ of the \nsilage paddock before allowing the balloon to descend below them.  \n\
  \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Final report 12 -001 Post contact with the power lines \n4.2.12.\
  \  As the balloon rose from beneath the level of the power line s, the nearest wire\
  \ caught ove r the \ncorner lip of the basket at the pilot's end.  A second wire\
  \ then caught lower down the basket.  \nThe pilot had applied both burners to initiate\
  \ a climb .  The balloon continued to rise and drift \nacross the farm track, lifting\
  \ the 2 wires and sliding al ong them towards Somerset  Road as it \ndid so.  \n\
  4.2.13.  If contact with a power line is imminent , pilots are advised to initiate\
  \ a rapid descent so that \nany contact is with the envelope instead of with  the\
  \ basket.  This is the instruction given in the \nballoon flight manual , so as\
  \ to  reduce  the height of the basket above the ground and less en \nthe risk and\
  \ severity of any injury.  The accident would have been  potentially survivable\
  \ if an \nimmediate descent had been initiated when the pilot first realised that\
  \ the balloon  was likely \nto hit the power line s.  For some reason the pilot\
  \ decided to try to out-climb the  power lines  \ninstead.  It is possible  that\
  \ he thought there was sufficient time or distance to enable  the \nballoon to out-climb\
  \ the power lines.   If so, this comes  down to a simple error in judgement.  \n\
  4.2.14.  Once the balloon was caught on the power lines the occupants were in extreme\
  \  danger.  A \nrapid deflation of the envelope at that point might still have risked\
  \ an electric arc or shock to \nthe occupants , but it would have  been the  more\
  \ sensible option while ensuring  that no-one \ntouched the power  lines or other\
  \ metal objects.   Instead the occupants reportedly grabbed the \npower line and\
  \ tried to push it off the basket.  This was always going to be difficult as the\
  \ \nballoon wa s at that time still trying to climb.  The likelihood of serious\
  \ or fatal injury was almost \ncertain once the balloon caught fire, but once it\
  \ broke free and rapidly climbed the chances of \nsurvival were negligible . \n\
  4.2.15.  Another instruction given in the flight man ual is  to shut off the fuel\
  \ bottles and lines, and vent \nthe fuel lines  to reduce the risk of a fire.  \
  \ It was not possible to  determin e whether the pilot \nhad turned off the 2 cross\
  \ -feed valves as part of his normal fuel managemen t or in response \nto the impending\
  \ collision  with the power  lines .  However, flight manual advice was to operate\
  \ \nwith the cross -feed valves closed unless otherwise required.  The \"as-found\"\
  \ condition would \nbe consistent with this.  One of the LPG cylinders that would\
  \ otherwise nor mally have been  \nopen had been shut off and the other had not.\
  \  It is possible that the pilot was in the process \nof shutting the system down\
  \ but did not have time before the electrical arcing occurred .  As it \nturned\
  \ out , his action probably would have  made little difference because the arcing\
  \ ruptured \none of the fuel cylinders , thereby  providing fuel to a source of\
  \ ignition.  H eat from the ensuing \nfire caused  the pressure relief valves on\
  \ the other bottles to burst , adding more fuel to the fire.  \n4.2.16.  The intense\
  \ fire that develop ed below  the mouth of the envelope would have heated the air\
  \ \ninside it and increased the tendency for the balloon to climb.  The 2 passengers\
  \ jump ing from \nthe basket would have lightened the load and also caused a greater\
  \  tendency for the balloon \nto climb.  However, this was not considered a significant\
  \  factor in comparison with the \nsustained use of the burners and the effect of\
  \ the fire.  The speed of the balloon 's ascent \nonce it broke free of the power\
  \ lines was significa ntly higher  than would have been expected \nhad the load\
  \ lightened by 2 passengers  alone .  The wires were calculated to have 4 m of free\
  \ \nvertical movement before coming under strain.  The ultimate tensile strength\
  \ of the wires was \n36.5 kilo newtons . The fact that the balloon lifted 2 heavy\
  \ wires and one wire parted  confirm s \nthat the balloon was generating a large\
  \ amount of lift as it pull ed the wires upward.   The action \nof the 2 passengers\
  \ in jumping from the basket was understandable in the circumstances and \ndid not\
  \ alter the outcome of the accident.  \n4.2.17.  Once the balloon broke free of\
  \ the power line , it continued to rise and drift west  across the \nroad.  The\
  \ fire spread to the envelope , which ultimately lost its ability to support the\
  \ weight of \nthe balloon.  The en velope  collapsed and separated  from the basket\
  \  shortly before it hit the \nground . \n  \n  \nFinal report 12 -001 \n<< Page\
  \ 33 >>\n Findings  \n1. The weather conditions were suitable for the balloon flight\
  \ that morning.  \n2. The pilot allowed the balloon to descend below the level of\
  \ power lines \nsurrounding a paddock in which  he did not intend to land.   It\
  \ could not be \ndetermined whether that action was deliberate or not, but it unnecessarily\
  \ \ncompromised the safety of the flig ht. \n3. It was highly  likely that the pilot\
  \ knew the location of the power lines and had \nseen  them before allowing the\
  \ balloon to descend below their height.  \n4. A last -minute change in wind direction\
  \ carried the balloon towards power lines \nthat the loaded balloon  was probably\
  \ not capable of out -climbing.  In any event, \nthe pilot exercised poor  judgement\
  \  by attempt ing to out -climb the power line s, \nand the balloon  collided with\
  \ them.  \n5. Electrical arcing from the power lines punctured one of the balloon's\
  \ LPG fuel \ncylinders, causing an intense fuel -fed fire that consumed the basket\
  \ and \nincreased the air temperature in the balloon envelope.  \n6. The pilot's\
  \ initial application of the burners  caused the balloon to climb.  Heat \nfrom\
  \ the basket fire and to a lesser extent 2 of t he balloon passengers jumping \n\
  from the basket increased  the balloon 's lift  and caused  it to break the power\
  \ line  \nthat was restraining it.  It then  ascend ed rapidly and f ell to the\
  \ ground once the \nenvelope caught fire.  \n7. Once a collision with power lines\
  \ is imminent, the recommended action is for the \npilot to descend the balloon\
  \  rapidly .  Had he done so there would have been a \nbetter chance of survival\
  \ for the balloon 's occupants . \n4.3. Performance of the pilot  \nGeneral  \n\
  4.3.1.  The pilot had accumulated more than  1000 hours  of ballooning and had flown\
  \ commercial \nballoon flights from his base in Carterton for nearly 15 years. \
  \ He had also landed near the \naccident site, possibly even in the same silage\
  \ paddock, several times before.  He was \ntherefore experienced and famil iar with\
  \ the local area.   \n4.3.2.  The pilot's medical certificate had lapsed 6 weeks\
  \ before the accident.  He subsequently flew \n9 flights, not including the accident\
  \ flight, with an expired medical certificate.  CAA Rules \nrequire d pilots to\
  \ maintain current medic al certificate s as part of their licence s (CAA, 2011)\
  \ .  \nHe had previously been made aware that his certificate was about to expire\
  \ but there was no \nevidence found to show that the pilot was in the process of\
  \ renewing it.  Undertak ing the flight \nknowing tha t he did not have a current\
  \  Class 1  medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation \nRules displayed\
  \ a certain disregard for the authority of those Rules. \n4.3.3.  The pilot was\
  \ , however , considered to be healthy and not suffering from any ailment that \n\
  would have prevented him flying.  The medical examiner was aware that the pilot\
  \ suffered \nfrom  gout and he believed this would not have precluded him from issuing\
  \ a class 1 medical \ncertificate . \nCannabis  \n4.3.4.  Pilots, like other persons\
  \  in safety -critical roles in aviation and other transport modes, need to \nbe\
  \ able to discharge their duties free of performance -impairing substances , such\
  \ as those \ncontained in drugs and alcohol.  Cannabis is a known per formance -impair\
  \ ing substance.  The \nCommission obtained the test results for blood samples taken\
  \ from the balloon pilot.  The \n\n<< Page 34 >>\n Final report 12 -001 samples\
  \ were not optimal. They were taken 3.5 days after the time of death and included\
  \ a \nmixture of other body fluids.  The sample s obtained could not  therefore\
  \ be considered as \n\"whole blood \".  They were , however , good enough to analyse\
  \ for performance -impairing \nsubstances such as cannabis, provided the appropriate\
  \ caveats were  considered.  \n4.3.5.  The pilot's urine was also tested for the\
  \ p resence of cotinine, a substance found in the urine \nof tobacco smokers.  This\
  \ test was negative, showing that it was highly unlikely the pilot had \nsmoked\
  \ regular tobacco on the morning of the flight.  The pilot also was not known by\
  \ his \nfriends and colleagues to smoke regular tobacco.  \n4.3.6.  The active ingredient\
  \ of cannabis is THC.  The sample analysed revealed a THC level of 2 \nmicrograms\
  \ per litre of blood  (fluid obtained).  This was well above that normally considered\
  \ \npossible for passive ingestion (inad vertent ingestion by being in the same\
  \ room as others who \nare smoking cannabis , for example [Mason, 1983 and Morland\
  \ , 1985]).20  This indicates that \nthe pilot had deliberately consumed the drug\
  \ at some point prior to the accident.   \n4.3.7.  Three experts in forensi c toxicology\
  \ gave their opinions on the pilot's post -mortem toxicology \nresults.  ESR and\
  \ Dr Robertson  gave their opinions based on the pilot being an occasional \nuser\
  \ of cannabis, and the Police expert based his opinion on the assumption that the\
  \ pilot was \na \"chronic\" user of cannabis , which was an assumption he made from\
  \ the information he was \ngiven, that the pilot was a \"long -term regular\" user\
  \ of cannabis.  It is not clear whether the \nterms \"chronic user\" and \"long\
  \ -term regular user\" mean the same thing.  In fact, it is a \nsubjective assessment\
  \  as to how much cannabis a person needs to consume , and how often , \nfor the\
  \ label of \"chronic user \" to apply .  \n4.3.8.  Under \"normal smoking conditions\
  \ \", a blood THC level of 2 micrograms per litre 70 -80 \nminutes after use would\
  \ be possible, based on an infrequent user smoking one or part of one \ncannabis\
  \ cigarette.21  On this basis, the level shown in the tests was consistent with\
  \ the pilot \nsmoking the equi valent of one cannabis cigarette up to 4 -6 hours\
  \ before the accident.  \n4.3.9.  The Police expert said that if the pilot was a\
  \ regular \"chronic\" user of cannabis, such a level of \nTHC in the blood could\
  \  be reached due to the post-mortem redistribution of THC from bod y \nfatty tissue.\
  \  He said  that in that case it would be possible that the pilot had not ingested\
  \ \ncannabis on the morning of the flight.  \n4.3.10.  On reviewing the medical\
  \ opinions the Commission accepts the premise that the more often a \nperson smokes\
  \ cannabis , the hi gher the likelihood of post -mortem THC readings being \nattributed\
  \ to post -mortem redistribution.  That is because the more a person  smoke s cannabis\
  \ \ngreater will be the accumulat ion of THC  in the body fatty tissue before it\
  \ can be eliminated \nfrom the body th rough natural process es.  Therefore, if\
  \ the pilot was a frequent user of \ncannabis, it would be possible that such a\
  \ level would  have  remain ed from previous use. \nConversely, if the pilot was\
  \ an infrequent user of cannabis, such a level would indicate more \nrecent use.22\
  \  The test results could therefore be the result of both longer -term and recent\
  \ \nuse. \n4.3.11.  The pilot's friend reported that he had not observe d the pilot\
  \ smoking cannabis the night \nbefore the accident, nor was the pilot observed by\
  \ his partner smoking  cannabis at home the \nprevious evening or before  he left\
  \ home on the morning of the flight.  That is not to say that he \ncould not have\
  \ done so at some time on his own, but both his friend and his partner said that\
  \ \nhe had not displayed any signs of having s moked cannabis the evening before\
  \ the flight.  \n4.3.12.  The 2 ground crew  and the photographer, all of whom had\
  \ worked with the pilot for many \nyears, did not see the pilot smoking on the morning\
  \ of the flight.  Each agreed that there were \n                               \
  \                         \n20 The research papers suggest that to start showing\
  \ a positive result for THC the pilot would have n eeded to  \nbe in a small, unventilated\
  \ room or motor vehicle on the morning of the accident with several people who \n\
  were smoking cannabis.  \n21 The 70 - to 80 -minute timeframe is the time from when\
  \ the pilot was observed smoking on the balcony to \nthe time of d eath.  \n22 Police\
  \ expert's opinion, Appendix 3.  ESR and Dr Robertson's opinions Appendix 4.  \n\
  \  \nFinal report 12 -001 \n<< Page 35 >>\n occasions during the morning when  they\
  \ were not with the pilot.  It is possible therefore that \nthe pilot smoked cannabis\
  \ at some time that morning, unseen by them.  \n4.3.13.  One of the ground crew\
  \ and the photographer were nevertheless adamant that the pilot did \nnot smoke\
  \ before  the flight.  They believed this because they did not notice him being\
  \ under \nthe influence of cannabis and did not notice the distinctive smell of\
  \ cannabis on the pilot.  The \n3 were aware that the pilot socialised with a group\
  \ that regularly u sed cannabis.  One of the 3 \nhad seen the pilot use cannabis\
  \ in his presence, and another suspected he had used \ncannabis before.  However,\
  \ all 3 said it would have been out of character for the pilot to \nsmoke cannabis\
  \ before a flight, especially in view of the passengers and other people \nassembled\
  \ that morning.  \n4.3.14.  The pilot was not averse to flouting rules.  He had\
  \ continued to operate his commercial \nballoon venture despite  his medical certificate\
  \ having expired some 6 weeks previously.  There \nare 2 other consi derations that\
  \ could also have altered his normal behaviour:  \n\uF0B7 the pilot was about to\
  \ lose a significant portion of his income with the return of the \nballoon to its\
  \ owner.  While he reportedly accepted this, it was the first topic he raised \n\
  with the 2 ground  crew and the photographer on the morning of the flight, and he\
  \ was \nnot happy about it  \n\uF0B7 the pilot was known to suffer from gout, and\
  \ was seen to be limping that morning.  Gout \nwas a  condition that may have affected\
  \ his behaviour.  \n4.3.15.  The 2 witnesses who saw th e pilot smoking on the balcony\
  \ of the shed shortly before the flight \nmade their reports only after they became\
  \ aware  that the pilot had tested positive for THC.  \nOne of them was made aware\
  \ of the results at a Police briefing before the public release of \nthe Commission's\
  \ interim report on the accident.  She reported what she had seen to the \nPolice\
  \ immediately after the briefing.  \n4.3.4  The 2 witnesses did not know what the\
  \ pilot was smoking and both assumed he was smoking \na regular cigarette.  After\
  \  making their re ports, the 2 witnesses were interviewed separately, \ninitially\
  \ by the Police, then by the Commission.  \n4.3.16.  The 2 witnesses were standing\
  \ about 25 m from the pilot and had a clear view of him on the \nbalcony.  Their\
  \ observations  were consistent.  They saw the pilo t taking something to his \n\
  mouth and smoke then rising from it.  They did not see the pilot drinking from the\
  \ cup he held.  \nTests made of the pilot's urine were negative for the substance\
  \ of cotinine, which means that \nif the pilot was smoking, he was not sm oking\
  \ regular tobacco.  \n4.3.17.  It has not been possible  to determine with any certainty\
  \ how often the pilot used cannabis.  It \nis possible that he used it more than\
  \ \"occasionally\" as described by those 2 witnesses who \nwere close to him - the\
  \ partner and  the friend.  Neither could be emphatic on that point \nbecause neither\
  \ was with the pilot all of the time.  Similarly for the 2 ground crew and \nphotographer,\
  \ as none of the 3 was with the pilot all of the time.  \n4.3.18.  On the balance\
  \ of probabilities the THC level of 2 micrograms per litre of blood resulted from\
  \ \nboth longer -term and recent use.  On reviewing the evidence available, it was\
  \ highly likely that \nthe pilot smoked cannabis on the morning of the flight. \
  \ The pilot was only on the balcony for a \nlimited time, so it was possible that\
  \ he smoked part of a cigarette only.  These c onclusions are \nsupported by the\
  \ following 3 points:  \n\uF0B7 2 witnesses observed the pilot smoking on the balcony\
  \ shortly before the flight  \n\uF0B7 the pilot was not known to smoke regular cigarettes\
  \ and his urine tested negative for \ncotinine, which is normally found in t he\
  \ urine of someone who has smoked regular \ntobacco  \n\uF0B7 the pilot was known\
  \ to use cannabis, including in the company of others.  \n4.3.19.  It has been suggested\
  \ that subtle cognitive impairment could develop in chronic users over \nseveral\
  \ years. Solowij  et al examined cog nitive functioning in a group of 9 long-term\
  \ cannabis \n\n<< Page 36 >>\n Final report 12 -001 users (Solowij, 2008). Their\
  \ findings suggested that long -term cannabis use may impair the \nefficient processing\
  \ of information.  \n4.3.20.  Given that it was highly likely that it was cannabis\
  \ the 2 witnesses saw t he pilot smoking, it \nwas only about 25 minutes before\
  \ commencing the flight and about one hour and 35 minutes \nto the time he was landing\
  \  the balloon in the Somerset Road area.  These times are well within \nthe 1.5\
  \ -4 hours that the subjective symptoms of can nabis intoxication are known to last.\
  \  \n4.3.21.  The opinion of the Commission's expert was that cognitive impairment\
  \ at or around the time of \nthe accident, and its contribution to the cause of\
  \ accident, could not  be excluded.  ESR noted \nthat symptoms of cannabis int oxication\
  \ usually peak 10 -15 minutes after smoking cannabis \nand last 1.5 -4 hours.  The\
  \ degree of cognitive impairment cannot be determined as the effects \nvary from\
  \ person to person.  Nevertheless, cognitive impairment of the pilot could not \
  \ be \nexcluded giv en the carry -over effect of cannabis from both recent and longer\
  \ -term use.  The \nextent to which longer -term use could cause cognitive impairment\
  \ would depend on the \nfrequency of use.  \n4.3.22.  Studies have shown that the\
  \ greater the judgement and skills required in  performing a task, \nthe greater\
  \ would be the impairment.  Flying low level across the paddock; replying to a radio\
  \ \ncall; preparing to land in variable wind conditions; and dealing with a sudden\
  \ change in flight \npath would have all combined to put the pilot  under some pressure\
  \ to make quick and correct  \ndecisions.  \n4.3.23.  The sections above refer to\
  \ a number of errors in judgement by the pilot , namely:  \n\uF0B7 allowing the\
  \ balloon to descend over the silage paddock and continue at a height below the\
  \ \nlevel of the power lines  - rather than maintain a safe height  \n\uF0B7 his\
  \ reaction to the last -minute change of direction towards the adjacent power lines\
  \ , in not \ndescending and landing  \n\uF0B7 his response once the balloon had\
  \ collided with the power lines , in not initiating an \nemergency descent.  \n\
  4.3.24.  Cognitive impairment  could typically contribute to these types of error.\
  \  Although it cannot be \nconcluded definitively that the cause of the accident\
  \ was the pilot smoking cannabis, the \npossibility that it did contribu te to the\
  \ accident could not be excluded.  \n4.3.25.  Pilots, others involved in the aviation\
  \ industry and the public all need to be aware of the \ndangers associated with\
  \ the use of performance -impairing substances.  The same principle \napplies to\
  \ all transport modes an d activities involving complex tasks requiring attention\
  \ and \nmental co -ordination.  \nARCs relating to the pilot   \n4.3.26.  The CAA\
  \ had longstanding concerns about the handling of ARCs, and had undertaken several\
  \ \nreviews in the previous  3 years.  The latest independent  review of ARCs highlighted\
  \ a number \nof systemic issues.  The CAA accepted the findings of the review and\
  \ has initiated changes in \nthe management of ARCs.  The ARC lodged in February\
  \ 2010 claiming this balloon pilot had \nbeen  unfit to conduct a flight was e xamined\
  \ in depth by the review's author, who found that \nfollow -up enquiries made by\
  \ CAA staff had been  appropriate for the information received.  \n4.3.27.  It was\
  \ not possible to say whether a more rigorous follow -up of the concern by the CAA\
  \ would \nhave prevented the 7 January 2012 accident.  What the case emphasises,\
  \ h owever, is the \nimportance of the CAA responding to ARCs as quickly, completely\
  \ and robustly as possible.  \nARCs provide valuable information about risk, and\
  \ the CAA needs to e nsure that this \ninformation is acted upon, focusing particularly\
  \ on those commercial operations that may put \nthe lives of members of the public\
  \ at risk .  While the CAA -initiated independent review \nconcluded that the CAA\
  \ had acted appropriately, this case s erves as a strong reminder that \nthis must\
  \ be an area of ongoing focus for the CAA.  \n  \nFinal report 12 -001 \n<< Page\
  \ 37 >>\n 4.3.28.  Had the CAA undertaken a more prompt and co -ordinated response\
  \ to the February 2010 ARC \nit could have identified a potential safety risk and\
  \ a range of preventive actions.   \nOther accidents where performance -impairing\
  \ substances were  involved  \n4.3.29.  As noted in paragraph 3. 6.4, the Commission\
  \ has investigated 6 occur rences in the past 10 \nyears, including in the rail\
  \ and marine modes, where crew members were found to have taken \nperformance -impairing\
  \  substances in the hours or days leading up to the accident s.  The \naviation\
  \ accidents included another Part 119 adventure activity (TAIC, 2010), and a \n\
  commercial air transport flight (TAIC, 2005).  While substance impairment could\
  \ not be \nidentified as a primary cause in these accidents, the use of these substances\
  \ by personnel \nresponsible for performing safety -critical tasks is a transport\
  \ -wide safety issue.  \n4.3.30.  On 8 March 2011, in its report on a collision\
  \ between a jet boat and a jetski, (TAIC, 2009), the \nCommission made a recommendation\
  \ to the Secretary for Transport regarding substance \nimpairment in the maritime\
  \ sector.  The recommendation referenced persons in charge of any \ncraft, but the\
  \ same could apply to a person who has responsibil ities or duties to do with safety\
  \ -\ncritical activities within the rail and aviation industries .  The recommendation\
  \ and the reply on \nbehalf of the Secretary for Transport  are shown below:  \n\
  Until legislation is made setting limits for and testing of alcohol a nd other \n\
  performance impairing substances for recreational and commercial boat drivers, \n\
  the risk of alcohol -related accidents will be elevated.  \nIt is recommended that\
  \ the Secretary for Transport address  this safety issue by \npromoting appropriate\
  \ legislatio n to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and \nother performance\
  \ impairing substances for persons in charge of recreational \nand commercial craft,\
  \ and supporting legislation to allow testing for such levels in \nthese cases.\
  \ (005/11)  \n4.3.31.  On 16 March 2011 the Ma nager Maritime and Freight of  the\
  \ Ministry of Transport replied to \nthe recommendation:  \nThe recommendation is\
  \ that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to \nset limits and establish\
  \ a testing regime to address the risk of recreational and \ncommercia l boating\
  \ accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance -\nimpairing substances.\
  \  \nRecreational and commercial boating is one of three areas of transport activity\
  \ \nwhere no alcohol and drug limits or testing regime yet exists.  The introduction\
  \ of \nsuch a regime in any of these areas would be a major policy decision for\
  \ \ngovernment that would need to be informed by a thorough understanding of the\
  \ \nproblem and the policy options.  The Ministry therefore intends to develop a\
  \ \nreport to government on the feas ibility of a compulsory post -accident and\
  \ \nincident drug and alcohol testing regime for the aviation, maritime and rail\
  \ \ntransport sectors.  \nAccordingly, implementation of recommendation 005/11 would\
  \ only be \npracticable once the relevant policy work has been undertaken by the\
  \ Ministry, \nand then only if the results indicated that a drug and alcohol testing\
  \ regime is a \nfeasible option.  \n4.3.32.  The Commission notes that this proposed\
  \ action fell short of what the Commission  \nrecommended, namely, that legislation\
  \ should set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and \nother performance -impairing\
  \ substances.  Post -accident and -incident testing on its own will \nnot act as\
  \ a sufficient deterrent unless it can be backed up with potential enforcement \n\
  measures.   The Commission belie ves there should be a zero tolerance to impairment\
  \ by drugs \nand alcohol in the transport sector, and random or targeted testing\
  \ should be included in the \nrange of measures to promote safer work practices.\
  \  \n4.3.33.  On 22 March 2012 , in its report on a loss of control and crash involving\
  \ a skydiving plane at \nFox Glacier a erodrome (TAIC , 10-010), the Commission\
  \ made a nother  recommendation to the \nSecretary for Transport  as follows:  \n\
  \n<< Page 38 >>\n Final report 12 -001 The use of performance impairing substances\
  \ is known to have a detrimental \neffect on the ability of people to safely operate\
  \ in critical transport \nenvironments.   The Commission recommends that the Secretary\
  \ for Transport \npromotes the introduction of a drug and alcohol detection and\
  \ deterrence regime \nfor persons employed in safety  critical transport roles (011/12).\
  \  \n4.3.34.  On 3 May 2012 the General Manager Aviation and Maritime of the Ministry\
  \ of Transport \nreplied, in part:  \nI accept the specific recommendation 011/12\
  \ directed to the Secretary for \nTransport.  \nI also urge the Commission to note\
  \ the existing health and safety in employment \nregulatory regime, where drugs\
  \ and alcohol are specifically mentioned in the \ndefinition of \"hazard\". This\
  \ regime already places obligations on both employers \nand employees.  \nSince\
  \ the Fox Glacier accident th e Minister of Transport has approved a new Rule \n\
  Part 115 that entered into force in November 2011.   The Rule requires \nadventure\
  \ aviation operations to be certified by 1 May 2012.   Adventure aviation \norganisations,\
  \ including commercial parachuting, now face  the risk that their \nsafety certification\
  \ can be suspended and removed for safety violations. This \ngives such operators\
  \ a stronger incentive to ensure they address alcohol and \ndrug taking safety risks\
  \ in their organisations.  \nOver the next two years the Gov ernment will be considering\
  \ rule amendments \nthat would require aviation organisations to introduce safety\
  \ management \nsystems.   This would require certificated operators to assess and\
  \ mitigate all \nsafety risks relevant to their operation.   This risk of into xication\
  \ of personnel by \ndrugs and alcohol would clearly be a safety risk that we would\
  \ expect both \noperators and the Civil Aviation Authority (when certifying and\
  \ auditing aviation \norganisations) to be actively addressing under an SMS regime.\
  \   Decisions w ill \nalso be made in the near future to ensure that the Civil Aviation\
  \ Authority is \nresourced to transition to the ICAO -endorsed SMS approach which\
  \ has \nwidespread industry support.  \nWhilst recognising that where the illegal\
  \ use of drugs is involved, changing  \nindividual behaviour will be challenging,\
  \ the Ministry will encourage the Civil \nAviation Authority to step up its effort\
  \ to alert the aviation community through \neducation of the risks that drugs pose\
  \ to the safety operation of aviation \nundertakings.   This will require an on\
  \ -going effort.  \nAs you are aware, the Ministry has developed a Transport Regulatory\
  \ Policy \nStatement that specific rule changes may not always be the best interventions\
  \ to \nachieve desire d safety outcomes.   Non-regulatory interventions ca n often\
  \ be \nmore appropriate.   In this regard we appreciate the Commission's \nrecommendation\
  \ to promote a drug and alcohol detection and deterrence \nregime, rather than to\
  \ implement a regime.  \nThe Ministry of Transport has in the past sponsored an\
  \ inter -agency  Substance \nImpairment Group.   This looked at whether or not compulsory\
  \ random drug and \nalcohol testing, and specific breath alcohol limits, should\
  \ be required by \nregulation in the aviation, marine and rail transport modes.\
  \   In part because of a \nlack of dat a, we were not convinced at that time that\
  \ the costs would outweigh \nthe benefits.   We will, however, monitor international\
  \ experience in this regard \nand, in particular, the recent relevant changes in\
  \ the Australian aviation regime.  \n4.3.35.  The Commission notes with concern\
  \ the p ossibility  that performa nce-impairing substances \n(cannabi s) contributed\
  \ to this accident  - one of New Zealand's worst aviation disasters.  While \nacknowledging\
  \ the benefit s of some of the steps outlined above in response to previous \nrecommend\
  \ ations, the Commission firmly believes that the risk of performance -impairing\
  \ \nsubstances contributing to future transport accidents and incidents will remain\
  \ unacceptably \nhigh until legislation is introduced to deal properly with this\
  \ safety issue.   \n \n  \nFinal report 12 -001 \n<< Page 39 >>\n Findings   \n\
  8. The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation\
  \ \nRules.  This was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way ,\
  \ but  it did \nshow a disregard for complying with the rules.  \n9. The pilot had\
  \ a  post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre .  This was \nlikely\
  \ the result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis  shortly  before the flight\
  \  \n(considered highly likely) , and residual THC from hi s having ingested  cannabis\
  \ \nover a longer  term that redistributed into his blood after he died .  It was\
  \ not \npossible to determine if either  factor contributed more  or less to the\
  \  toxicology \nresult . \n10. The accident was caused by errors of judgement by\
  \ the pilot .  The possibility that \nthe pilot's performance was impaired as a\
  \ result of ingesting cannabis  cannot be \nexcluded.  \n11. The l ong-term and\
  \ recent ingestion of performance -impairing substances such as \ncannabis  by crew\
  \ of any transport vehicle is a serious safety issue that needs to \nbe addressed\
  \ as a matter of priority.  \n4.4. Balloon  maintenance  and performance  \n4.4.1.\
  \  Ballooning in New Zealand is a small -scale activity , with 74 balloons recorded\
  \ on the CAA \naircraft register, i ncluding numerous small 2 - and 4 -person balloons,\
  \ and some that have not \nflown for extended periods of time.   As a re sult ballooning\
  \ has attracted less attention from \nthe CAA, which had little in-house  expertise\
  \ in the maintenance of balloons  at the time of the \naccident .  The CAA had therefore\
  \ delegated the responsibility for the initial inspection for the \ncertificate\
  \ of airworthiness to more experienced maintenance engineers.  This was the case\
  \ \nwith the accident balloon  ZK-XXF and its predecessor ZK -EMB.  \n4.4.2.  The\
  \ delegation of balloon inspections still meant that the CAA retained the  responsibility\
  \ for \nensuring that the documentation submitted for approval and the issuing of\
  \ certificates was \ncorrect.   The documents submitted by the maintenance provider\
  \ for the accident balloon \ncontained er rors that had not been identified  by\
  \ the CAA.  Similar certification errors were \nfound with some other balloons \
  \ as well . \n4.4.3.  Balloons are obviously different from  other  aircraft  types;\
  \  nevertheless , they still need to be \nrigorously maintained .  The Commission\
  \ found no evidence of any mechanical or envelope \ndefect  that contributed to\
  \ the accident.  The flight proceeded normally.  The pilot reported no \nissues.\
  \  The burners were seen and heard to be operating and the balloon was seen to begin\
  \ \nclimbin g just before and after contact with the wires.  In spite of the fire\
  \ and impact damage, \nthe balloon was found to be in good working order.  \n4.4.4.\
  \  However, the maintenance performed on ZK -XXF, namely the documentation,  was\
  \ \nsubstandard .  T he Commission was concern ed that this could  have extended\
  \ to other \nballoons , so it  published an urgent recommendation to the Director\
  \ of Civil Aviation  to address \nthis safety issue. (Refer to section 7 , Recommendations\
  \ , and section 6, Safety actions ). \n4.4.5.  The ARC on the practices of t he\
  \ balloon maintainer, had it been followed through properly by \nthe CAA, should\
  \ have identified the need for the CAA to improve its oversight of that part of\
  \ the \nballoon industry much sooner than when this accident occurred.  However,\
  \ as stated earlier, \nnothing in the maintenance procedures for this balloon contributed\
  \ to the accident.  The \nsafety actions taken by the CAA in its handling of ARCs\
  \ has addressed that safety issue.  \n4.5. Balloon safety  \n4.5.1.  The Commission\
  \ examined the design and construction of balloons, and the emergency \nequipment\
  \ and procedures , and tested those factors against the survivability of this accident.\
  \  \n\n<< Page 40 >>\n Final report 12 -001 4.5.2.  Balloon envelope material has\
  \ improved with the introduction of increasingly stronger , tear -\nresistant fabrics\
  \ .  Envelopes can last longer, sust ain greater heat damage and better endure \
  \ \nthe effects of the sun and moisture  than previously .  There are required tests\
  \ to monitor the \ncondition and performance of the balloon envelope.   \n4.5.3.\
  \  The basket , meanwhile , has change d little, with c ane and wicker cont inuing\
  \ to be the princip al \nmaterials used in construction.  These materials are lightweight\
  \ and provide both strength and \nflexibility.  They are able to absorb the repeated\
  \ knocks o f a landing and sliding along the \nground and often tipping over.  The\
  \ drawb ack is that cane, which is normally  varnished, has \nlimited  fire-resistant\
  \ qualities.  Fire-resistant materials are usually a stipulation for enclosed \n\
  commercial transport vehicles where opportunit ies for passenger escape can be limited.\
  \  The \nconcept is to try to limit the spread of fire long enough to enable opportunities\
  \ for both fire -\nfighting and escape.  \n4.5.4.  In this case the electrical arcing\
  \ and the ensuing LPG -fed fire were intense.  There are not \nmany  materials available\
  \ that would be resistant to fires of that intensity and still be suitable \nfor\
  \ balloon baskets.  In these situations the primary defence against this type of\
  \ fire is first \navoiding the electrical arcing, and second starv ing the fire\
  \ of f uel.  LPG is highly flammable \nand the design of the fuel system was so\
  \ that the entire system could be closed off.  This \nsituation where one of the\
  \ LPG bottles was punctured by the electrical arcing was unusual .  \nThe ensuing\
  \ fire would have been almost unc ontainable, even if the basket had been \nconstructed\
  \ from fire -retardant material.  \n4.5.5.  The balloon  was required to be fitted\
  \ with a fire extinguisher and one was found in the \nwreckage with the safety pin\
  \ still in place, which indicated it had not been used.  P hotographs \ntaken on\
  \ the morning of the accident show that it had been  stowed centrally in the pilot's\
  \ \ncompartment next to the passenger compartments.  Passengers might  have been\
  \ able to \nreach  the extinguisher, but would have firstly needed to know it was\
  \ th ere and then  needed to \nlean over the basket partition to reach it . \n4.5.6.\
  \  The initial location and intensity of the fire may have prevented the occupants\
  \ reaching  the \nextinguisher.  Regardless, the New Zealand Fire Service investigator\
  \ who assisted the \nCommission  considered that the extinguisher would have had\
  \ little or no effect in containing \nthe very hot fuel -fed fire.   These types\
  \ of extinguisher were  designed to extinguish or contain \nsmaller fires.  In different\
  \ circumstances, having the basket constructed fro m fire -retardant \nmaterial\
  \ could have slowed the spread of a small fire and increase d the chance of the\
  \ balloon \noccupants extinguishing it.  Manufacturers of balloon baskets should\
  \ consider this when \ndesigning future baskets.  \n4.5.7.  The pilot g ave 2 briefings\
  \ to t he passengers before the flight.  The first was a general welcome \nwith\
  \ a  description of the balloon , the preparation for the flight and how to enter\
  \ and exit the \nbasket .  The second briefing was a safety briefing , which normally\
  \ included practi sing the \nlanding position  and where to place the hands , and\
  \ instructions to not attempt to vacate the \nbasket until instructed by the pilot.\
  \ According to experienced ballooning pilots in New Zealand \nand overseas, a balloon\
  \ pilot would not normally brief passengers o n the emergency \nequipment available\
  \ or how to operate the control lines.   It would be common, especially in \nsingle\
  \ -compartment baskets, to instruct passengers not to interfere with the control\
  \ lines , as \nthe incorrect use of the controls could be fatal.  \n4.5.8.  There\
  \ is an argument that had the pilot become incapacitated by the initial electrical\
  \ arcing , a \npassenger could have descended the balloon using the emergency deflation\
  \ cord had they \nbeen instructed in its use.  This would need to be balanced with\
  \ the risk o f a passenger \npanicking and pulling the cord at an inappropriate\
  \ time . \n4.5.9.  The Commission could identify no obvious improvements in the\
  \ design and operation of \nballoons in general that might have improved the chances\
  \ of surviva l of the balloon occupants \nin thi s accident.  \n4.5.10.  The emergency\
  \ services received multiple notifications of the accident and responded \npromptly,\
  \ reac hing the accident site within 6 minutes .  This was a good response.  A faster\
  \  \nresponse would not have improved the survivability of this accident.  \n  \n\
  Final report 12 -001 \n<< Page 41 >>\n 4.5.11.  There is no requirement to hold\
  \ a licence for private ballooning in New Zealand.  This was not \na factor in this\
  \ accident because the pilot was experienced and held a commercial balloon \nlicence.\
  \  However, the absence of a private balloon licence, with its associated requirements\
  \ \nfor theoretical and practical examinations and medical standards, is at variance\
  \ with \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization guidelines and those of other\
  \ countries with similarly \ndeveloped histor ies of ballooning.  Fort unately new\
  \ balloon pilots usually seek guidance and \ntraining from experienced pilots and\
  \ operate within an association of balloonists that provide s \nsome supervision.\
  \  The Director of Civil Aviation has issue d an NPRM  seeking to introduce a \n\
  mandatory priva te balloon licence and a balloon instructor rating, which should\
  \  address this \nsafety issue  (see section 6 for details) . \n4.5.12.  Civil Aviation\
  \ Rule Part 115 Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations came into effect\
  \ \non 10 November 2011, about 2 months befo re this accident.  Transitional arrangements\
  \ \nmeant that balloon operators were not required to comply until May 2012, about\
  \ 4 months \nafter the accident.  The Commission has concluded that , for the reason\
  \ s given in this section , \nthe regulatory oversight of the ballooning industry\
  \ was not sufficient for its size and the \npotential risk to the public, for both\
  \ private and commercial balloon operations.  The \nintroduction of Rule Part 115\
  \ should provide a good mechanism for balloon operators to \nimprove the safety\
  \  of operations, and for the CAA to maintain appropriate oversight of the \nindustry.\
  \  \nFindings   \n12. The r egulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New\
  \ Zealand was not \nsufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the\
  \ New Zealand public.  \n13. It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed\
  \ training, knowledge or \nmedical certificate can take non -paying passengers for\
  \ a balloon flight.   \n14. The basic design and safety of the balloon were  adequate\
  \ and improvements in \nthe design would not have alt ered the outcome of this accident.\
