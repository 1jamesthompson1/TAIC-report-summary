The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports shoul d be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any r ecommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
General  
1.1. At 063 9 on Saturday 7 January 2012, a Cameron Balloons Limited A210 hot -air balloon lifted 
off from near Carterton in the Wairarapa area for a commercial flight.  There were  one pilot 
and 10 passengers on board.  The weather conditions were fine with a light and variable wind, 
which was suitable for the flight.  The b alloon had been airborne for about 35 minutes when 
the pilot began to descend the balloon in preparation for landing in the Somerset Road area.  
1.2. The balloon changed direction several times as it descended to lower levels.  At about 072 0 
the balloon descende d to between 5 and 7 met res (m) from the ground as it drifted over a 
silage paddock.  The paddock was bounded on 2 sides by 33 -kilovolt (kV) power lines with an 
average height of about 9 m.  The balloon had earlier drifted near that paddock at a height of 
between 30 and 60 m , heading in the opposite direction.  
1.3. The balloon was drifting towards the power lines on the far road -end boundary when the wind 
changed and took it towards power lines closer to the adjacent boundary.  The pilot applied 
the burners to t ry to out-climb the power lines, but the basket of the balloon became 
entangled in the m. 
1.4. About 15 -30 seconds later , at 0722 , an intense electrical arcing occurred and fire erupted in 
the lower part of the basket.  One of the balloon’s liquefied petroleum g as (LPG) fuel cylinders 
was ruptured by the electrical arcing, and escaping fuel intensified the fire.  
1.5. Two of the passengers jumped wh ile the basket was still caught on the wires  and continuing to 
climb .  The height was about 20 m by this time and they die d from their injuries.  Heat from 
the fire further raised the air temperature in the balloon envelope to a point where it broke the 
wire that was restraining it.  The balloon rapidly ascended to a height of between 110 and 150 
m before the balloon envelope  caught fire and collapsed, and the balloon fell to the ground.  
The pilot and 8 remaining passengers died from their injuries.  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) concluded that the pilot had 
not intend ed to land in the paddock bo unded by the power lines and that it had been  an 
unsafe manoeuvre to allow the balloon to descend below the level of the power lines  and 
remain at low level as it crossed the paddock .  The Commission also concluded that when the 
balloon flew towards the po wer lines and collision was unavoidable , the pilot should have 
followed the balloon manufacturer’s advice and rapidly descended his balloon instead of 
making it climb.  Had he done so , the balloon occupants would have had a better chance of 
survival.  
1.7. Post-mortem toxicology tests revealed the pilot had a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) level of 2 
micrograms per litre  (µg/l) of blood .  THC is an active ingredient of cannabis.2  The 
Commission concluded that this THC level had been  caused by both long -term and  recent use 
of cannabis .  While it is difficult to say how much each  type of use  contributed to the result, 
cannabis is known to affect a person’s judgement and decision -making ability .  Poor 
judgement and poor decision -making were factors contributing to  this accident .  The 
Commission found that the pilot’s use of cannabis could not  be excluded as a factor 
contributing to his errors of judgement , and therefore to the accident .  
Recommendations  
1.8. The Commission has already made recommendations to  the Governme nt about passing  
legislation to address the safety issue of the use of performance -impairing substances in all 
transport modes.   The Commission makes a further recommendation on this matter.  
                                                        
2 Cannabis is a general term for the many different preparations of the drug.  Marijuana comes from the 
dried flowering to ps and leaves of the plant.  Hashish comes from the dried cannabis resin and compressed 
leaves.  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report 12 -001 1.9. The Commission also found that the practices of the maintenance provider for the balloon 
were not in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules .  An urgent r ecommendation w as made to the 
Director of Civil Aviation to address any maintenance issues with the balloon industry.  The 
Director has already taken sufficient action t o close that recommendation.   However, the 
investigation found no maintenance issues or mechanical defects with the balloon that 
contributed to the accident.   
1.10.  Although not relevant to this accident, the Commission also expresse d concern at the lack of 
regulation covering private ballooning.  The Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) has 
already issued a notice of proposed rule -making (NPRM) to address this safety issue.  
Key lessons  
1.11.  Both long -term and recent use of cannabis may significantly impair a person’s performance  of 
their duties , especially those involving complex tasks .  Under no circumstances should 
operators of transport vehicles , or crew  members and support crew with safety -critical roles , 
ever use it.  
1.12.  Power lines are a well recognised  critical hazard to hot -air balloon operations.  Balloon pilots 
should give them a wide margin and if they ever inadvertently encounter them, they should 
follow the balloon manufacturers ’ advice and best industry practice to mitigate the possible 
consequenc es.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The balloon struck power lines at 0722 on Saturday 7 January 2012.  The Rescue 
Coordination Centre and later the CAA notified the Commission of the accident at about 0800 
that same day.  The Commission immediately opened an in quiry into the accident under 
section 13(b) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an 
Investigator  in Charge.  The Commission assembled an investigation team in Carterton by 
midday that same day, with the remainder of the  team arriving later that afternoon.  
2.2. Because the balloon had been manufactured in the United Kingdom , the Commission asked 
the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) to appoint an Accredited 
Representative under Annex 13 to the Convention  on International  Civil Aviation .  The Air 
Accident s Investigation Branch appointed a non -travelling accredited representative  to 
participate in the inquiry . 
2.3. During  the following 5 days the investigation team conducted the site investigation and 
interviewed witnesses, including the ground crew for the operator.  
2.4. Once the site investigation was complete, the wreckage was removed and transported to the 
Commission’s secure workshop in Wellington for further examination.   The components of the 
basket s tructure were reconstructed at the workshop.  
2.5. The Commission liaised with the power lines  company (Powerco) and the grid operator 
(Transpower) to establish the sequence of events relating to the power outage caused by the 
balloon strike.  The severed and da maged section of power line was also taken to the 
Commission’s secure workshop in Wellington, where it was  examined together with the 
reconstructed balloon basket.   The New Zealand Fire Service also provided specialist advi ce 
on the characteristics of the fire. 
2.6. A global positioning system (GPS) was being used by the pilot of the balloon during the flight.  
This damaged GPS was sent to the Australian Transportation Safety Bureau (ATSB)  recorders 
laboratory, where data was successfully downloaded.  This data was cross -referenced with 
witness statements and photographs taken by witnesses and passengers on board the 
balloon to recreate the flight of the balloon.  
2.7. Records were obtained from the CAA, and from New Zealand Police, which was also 
conducting an investi gation for the Coroner.  Balloon maintenance records were reviewed and 
the maintenance provider and owner were interview ed. 
2.8. The initial enquiries into the balloon maintenance revealed a safety issue that urgently needed 
addressing, so o n 15 February 2012 the Commission made an urgent recommendation to the 
Director of Civil Aviation to address that safety issue . 
2.9. The Commission published an interim report on the accident on 10 May  2012, which included 
the facts that had been established up to that time, but n o analysis or findings.  
2.10.  Post-mortem and toxicology reports were obtained , and because the initial results showed that 
the pilot had tested positive for performance -impairing substances, the Commission engaged 
its own independent expert in the area of toxicology to review the report  and conclusions of 
the expert for the testing laboratory . 
2.11.  The Commission also considered the evidence of a third  expert in the area of to xicology who 
was engaged by New Zealand Police on behalf of the Coroner.  

<< Page 4 >>
 Final report 12 -001 2.12.  The Commission’s consultant medical specialist also assisted the Commission during its 
inquiry, particularly in terms of reviewing medical information, including post -mortem and 
toxic ology reports.3  
2.13.  Statements were taken from 2 witnesses following the release of the interim report.  On 21 
March 2013 t he same 2 witnesses appeared before the Commission to give their evidence in 
person.  As a result, the 3 experts who had provided commen t on the toxicology reports were 
requested to make additional comment.  
2.14.  On 5 June 2013  the Commission approved the draft final report to be circulated to “interested 
persons” for comment.   The Commission identified 11 “persons ” who should receive a copy of  
the draft report.  A closing date of 28 June 2013 was set for submissions on the draft report.  
This was extended to 5 July 2013 at the request of one of the recip ients. During  the next few 
days the recip ients and the next -of-kin of the passe ngers were co ntacted and updated on the 
progress o f the inquiry.   
2.15.  Submissions on the draft report were received from the following:  
 the 2 ground crew  
 the freelance photographer  
 the Police expert  
 the CAA 
 the AAIB, including comment by a balloon ing expert engaged by the AAIB 
 the Ministry of Transport.  
Those recipients who did not make submissions were contacted to ensure they had the 
opportunity to comment.   
2.16.  On 24 July 2013 the Commission reviewed all the submissions , and changes to the draft 
report  were made where appropriate.  The Commission also directed that a further 
investigation be undertaken on the relevance of the toxicology results fr om the pilot , and a s a 
result  a further 3 witnesses appeared before the Commission to give evidence in perso n.  
Additional changes were made to the draft report as a result of hearing the 3 witnesses.   
2.17.  The Commission approved the final report for publication on 9 October 2013 .  
2.18.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the ATSB  in the recovery of GPS data, and 
the A AIB in the co -ordinating of specialist advice from the balloon manufacturer, the British 
Balloon and Airship Club (BBAC) and a ballooning expert .  The Commission also acknowledges 
the specialist advice provided by Pow erco, Transpower  and the New Zealand Fire Service .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Saturday 7 January 2012, a Cameron Balloons A210 hot -air balloon4 (registration ZK -XXF) 
was booked to fly a local commercial adventure flight from Carterton.  At 0457 the pilot sent a 
text message to his 2 ground crew and a freelance photographer, asking  them to meet him at 
the shed where the balloon was stored by 0545.  The 3 had worked with the pilot for several 
years .  The pilot arrived at the shed on the northern outski rts of Carterton at about 052 5, with 
the others arriving between about 05 30 and 055 0.   
3.1.2.  At about 0540  the pilot  released a small helium -filled pilot balloon to check if the wind 
conditions were suitable for the flight.  The flight path of the small balloon  confirmed there 
was little or no wind present and the pilot decided  to make  the flight.  The balloon was then 
taken by trailer to a gate nearby that led to the launch area – a small mown area in an 
adjacent paddock.   
3.1.3.  The passengers started arriving from about 0545 and were met by the 2 ground crew 
members , and shortly after by the pilot who had walked from the shed.  The ground crew  gave 
each  arriving passenger  a breakfast order and passenger loading form to complete.  
Meanwhile the pilot went an d unlocke d a nearby building that had  toilet facilities for the 
passengers.   Shortly after wards  2 witnesses5 saw the pilot standing on a balcony of the 
building  between 20 m and  30 m from the assembly area .  They observed that he was 
smoking  but they thought nothing of it at the time.   (See paragrap hs 3.5.6 and 3. 5.7 for 
further comment.)  
3.1.4.  At about 0610 the pilot re-joined the group , stood on the side of the trailer and welcomed the 
10 passengers  and introduced the crew .  He then gave an initial briefin g on the balloon and 
the planned sequence of events.  The balloon was taken by trailer to the launch site, where it 
was offloaded and laid out on the grass in preparation for inflation.  Initially a  cold-air fan  was 
used to inflate the envelope, a process that one of the ground crew reported took a little 
longer than normal.  There was morning dew on the ground, which can hold  the envelope 
down , making it more difficult to inflate.  To complete the inflation and lift the envelope off the 
ground, hot air was  added  using the balloon’s burners. Several of the passengers assisted the 
pilot and ground crew with the inflation , which was a typical way of involving passengers with 
the flight preparation . 
3.1.5.  The freelance photographer recorded the inflation  of the balloon and wa s following his usual 
pattern of photographing the passengers and balloon during the preparation for the flight.  He 
would then  follow the flight of the balloon , taking photographs along the way.  
3.1.6.  At 0635 the passengers boarded the ba lloon and the pilot gave them a second briefing, 
primarily covering what the passengers should do when landing.   At 0638 the launch restraint 
or tie -off line attaching the basket to one of the support vehicles was released, the burners 
were operated to hea t the air in the envelope further , and the  balloon lifted off.  
3.1.7.  The pilot and ground crew had a set of 3 pre -arranged radio calls, called Check One, Check 
Two and Check Three.  As the balloon departed, the ground crew packed up the remaining 
equipment and t he crew chief made the Check One call, confirming that the launch site was 
clear and that they were leaving.  The pilot acknowledged the call, which meant that all was 
well with the balloon and passengers.  The 2 ground crew then drove the operator’s 2 veh icles 
to a local café where the orders for the post -flight breakfast were placed.  The ground crew 
were followed  by a group of relatives of 2 of the passengers on board the balloon.  
                                                        
4 For simplicity, ho t-air balloons are  hereafter referred to as balloons.  
5 The witnesses came forward with this information immediately after attending Police and Commission 
briefings in preparation for the release of the interim report, which included information that the p ilot had 
tested positive for cannabis.  

<< Page 6 >>
 Final report 12 -001 3.1.8.  The ground crew remained at the café and kept a watch on the progress of t he balloon.  The 
flight was also witnessed by the photographer, who travelled independently.   Local residents 
were familiar with the sight of the balloon flying around the area and some witnessed portions 
of the flight, as did several visitors to the area.   Witnesses described the balloon climbing to 
about 450 m in near -calm conditions, then drifting slowly south -east before moving in a 
northerly then an easterly direction.  Because of the near -calm conditions and the  slow, 
irregular movement of the balloo n, the ground crew remained near the café for about 20 
minutes before leaving.  The Check Two call was then made, advising the pilot that they were 
on the road following the balloon.  The chase vehicles initially moved to just north -east of 
Carterton and w aited in a car park by State Highway 2.  
3.1.9.  About 30 minutes after lift -off, the crew chief made the Check Three call, a reminder to the 
pilot of the time and to gain a n indication from the pilot of where the balloon might land .  The 
pilot acknowledged that ca ll and advised that the landing looked like being in the Somerset 
Road area.  The balloon was seen to descend about this time, crossing Somerset Road about 
100 m from State Highway 2 and drifting south -east.  The crew chief in the first chase vehicle 
start ed to move along Somerset Road to watch the balloon .  The balloon then  started to drift 
to the north -east, crossing Somerset Road again.   At about this time the pilot radioed the 
ground crew and told them to “hold there” as the balloon drifted farther away  from the road  
(see Figure 2). 
3.1.10.  The ground crew, photographer and following relatives kept a watch on the balloon’s progress.  
Several residents of Somerset Road and others who worked there saw the balloon after it 
descended and drifted slowly around their area.  One resident (“Witness A”) was inside her 
house immediately adjacent to where the balloon later entangled with power lines.  She heard 
the noise of the burners, so she went outside to the back of the house and watched as the 
balloon moved slowly pas t the house heading to the north -east.  Witness A was able to see the 
people in the basket and estimated that the balloon was not much higher than the top of 
nearby  tall trees as it drifted past.  These trees were about 20  m high.  Witness A then went 
back inside as she thought the balloon was going to land well to the north of her house , as it 
seemed to her to be holding about the same height.  
3.1.11.  Other w itnesses’ estimates of the height of the balloon as it drifted farther north  of Somerset 
Road  varied between 30  m and  60 m.6   
3.1.12.  About 400  m from Somerset Road, the flight path of the balloon changed again and it started 
drifting in a south -westerly direction back towards Somerset Road.  The pilot radioed the 
ground crew again and told them that the  landing place looked to be near Somerset Road.  
The second chase vehicle and the relatives stopped in Somerset Road and alighted from their 
vehicles to watch as the balloon started to drift towards the centre of a silage paddock7 near  
the property of Witness A.  The crew chief in the first chase vehicle did a U-turn and joined 
them .  At about 0720 the witnesses saw the balloon descend to between 5  m and 7  m as it 
crossed the silage paddock where several rows of irrigation sprinklers were operating .   
3.1.13.  A member of the group of relatives following the balloon later reported that after getting out of 
their vehicle, they felt a breeze blowing from their left (north) as they watched the balloon 
approach across the silage paddock.  The breeze was not consider ed strong and was 
described as being “an isolated gust of wind”.  The crew chief, thinking the pilot might cross 
the road and land in an adjacent paddock, walked along the road to check for access and 
obstacles for the pilot.  He radioed to the pilot askin g if he had seen the horse in a paddock  
over the road .  The pilot radioed back that he had seen the horse.  
3.1.14.  As the balloon approached Somerset Road , Witness A and members of the chase team and 
following group heard both  burners operating.  The balloon was s een to drift left towards 
power lines that ran along the side of the silage paddock and near Witness A’s house.  The 
balloon then slowly started to climb.  During this time the crew chief continued walking along

 Somerset Road and found an access gate on th e western side of the road.  As the crew chief 
returned to his vehicle he heard the pilot yell out , “Duck down”.  The crew chief turned around 
in time to see the balloon basket contact the top power line.  
3.1.15.  Witness A was near the kitchen window  facing the silage paddock .  She  saw the balloon 
approaching the power line s at low level  and ran outside and into the backyard in time to see 
the basket being caught under one of the wires.  She recalled that the burners had stopped 
operating by this time.

Accident site  
3.1.16.  The photographer, realising that the balloon was likely t o land before he could get to the 
landing site, stopped his vehicle  farther south along Somerset Road  so that he could continue 
to take  photograph s using a tele photo  lens.  These showed the balloon as it collided with the 
power line.  The photographs showed one of the wires caught over the pilot’s end of the 
basket.  The balloon was lifting the wire upwards, indicating that the balloon was trying to rise. 
Photographs also showed a second wire caught farther down the side of the basket at th e 
same end.  Witness A described some of the occupants trying to push the top wire off the lip of 
the basket.  
3.1.17.  As the balloon continued to r ise it also began to slide along the power line towards Somerset 
Road.  Based on photographic time stamp data, at bet ween 15 and 30 seconds after 
contacting the wires  an electrical arc  and substantial flash  occurred  in the vicinity of the 
basket .  A fire immediately erupted low down in the basket  and quickly  took hold .  The wire 
that had been caught lower down on the bas ket disentangled  and fell free.  Two of the 
passengers jumped from the burning basket while it was still about 20  m above the ground.

 Final report 12 -001 3.1.18.  The fire increased in intensity, engulfing the basket and eventually setting fire to  the envelope.  
The balloon continue d to climb but was still restrained by the remaining wire .  This wire 
eventually parted and fell to the ground. T he balloon continued to  ascend  rapidly to a height of 
between 110 and 1 50 m, at which point the envelope collapsed and the balloon fell to the 
ground .8  The time from the arc flash to when the wire finally separated from the basket was 
between 75 and 80 seconds .  The balloon continued to climb  for about  another 4 0 seconds 
before falling .  The balloon hit the ground  a total of 2 minutes and 5 seco nds after the start of 
the arcing .   
3.1.19.  Emergency services were alerted to the accident at 0723 and the first response vehicle from 
Carterton arrived on the scene at 0729.  This was shortly followed by other vehicles from 
Carterton, Greytown and Masterton.  Emergency staff took over the first aid efforts,  as well as 
extinguishing the still-burning wreckage.  T he balloon occupants , including the 2 who had 
jumped,  were found to have died at the scene.  
3.2. Site and impact information  
3.2.1.  The accident site was on Somerse t Road, one kilometre ( km) east of Carter ton.  The 
surrounding area was farmland, predominantly grassed for dairying.  Several  power lines 
crossed  the local area , including a line running alongside  Somerset Road.   
3.2.2.  The power line that the balloon struck ran perpendicular to Somerset Road and was part of a 
dual-voltage span with three 33 000 -volt (33  kV) wires strung at the top and three  11 000 -volt 
(11 kV) wires below.  The 33  kV wires were each 17 millimetres in diameter and part of the 
feeder line to Carterton.  The  33 kV wires were suspended 10  m above the ground at the 
poles, dropping to 8  m at the centre  of the 100  m span.  The 6.3-millimetre -diameter 11 kV 
wires were about 1 m below that.   The power line ran alongside the northern side of a farm 
track that bordered the silage paddock with the sprinklers .  A small paddock lay between the 
track  and the house occupied by W itness A.   The power line consisted mainly of single 
concrete poles, but there were 2 double poles at the Somerset Road end of the line where the 
span  finished and the line changed direction  to follow Somerset Road . 
3.2.3.  A preliminary examination of the 33  kV power line was completed before any repair work was 
started.  The wire closest to the silage paddock (the blue phase  wire)  was found broken and 
lying across the remaining 2 wires.   This was the wire that had been  caught across the top of 
the basket.   It displayed significant damage. The centre wire (the yellow phase  wire)  was still 
suspended from the poles and displayed some damage.  This was the wire seen caught near 
the bottom of the balloon basket.  The wire closest to the small paddock  (the red phase  wire) 
was still suspended from the poles and showed little damage.  
3.2.4.  The balloon wreckage was found concentrated in a paddock situated on the other side of 
Somerset Road , 150 m west of where the balloon first contact ed the power line .  The envelope 
had separated from the basket where the flying cables from the basket attach ed to the base 
tape at the mouth of the envelope, or at t he opposite end where they attached to the basket .  
The basket had struck  the ground almost  level .  The metal framing  of the basket , the burner 
frame and burners had collapsed downwards  with the impact and slightly away from the pilot’s 
end.  Two fuel cylinders had been thrown clear of the wreckage and lay near the envelope 
several metres away.  The wreckage had continued to burn on the ground  until extinguished 
by emergency services, with most of the wooden  wicker and cane construction  materia l 
destroyed.   Debris was scattered between the point of contact with the power line and the 
wreckage . 
3.2.5.  The 2 passengers  who jumped from the basket fell to the small paddock adjacent to Witness 
A’s house .  The other 8 passengers and the pilot were found in or next to the wreckage of the 
basket.

 3.2.6.  Emergency  personnel noted  that 3 of the LPG fuel cylinders  were empty when they arrived and 
that the fourth cylinder  was still venting gas .  This cylinder was moved away  from the main 
wreckage and cooled as a precaution  to protect personnel.   The New Zealand Fire Service 
advised that a combination of water and fire -retardant additive was used to extinguish the last 
of the fires, with some of the retardant being sprayed onto the envelope.  
Damage assessment  
3.2.7.  The balloon wreckage was first examined on site before being removed to Commission 
facilities , where a reconstruction of what was left of the basket was made (see Figure 2).  Two 
of the 3 power line wires  from the span that the balloon contacted were removed  and 
examin ed by investigators  with the assistance of staff from Powerco , the local lines company,  
and the New Zealand Fire Service.  
3.2.8.  An e xamination of the broken and damaged power line wires confirmed that the balloon had 
first contacted the wires about 85  m in from Somerset Road , before sliding along the line 
towards the road .  The damage to the power line wires included stress marks , mechanical 
damage, burn patterns and evidence of arcing.   
3.2.9.  Powerco reported that based on its experience and knowledge, “high  voltage electrical arcs 
comprise a cloud of ionised air plasma, with a temperature at the boundaries of approximately 
5000 degre es Celsius, and internal arc temperatures reaching 20 000 degrees Celsius” .  
Further, the rapid increase in temperature causes “an expansion of air and vaporisation or 
melting of solid material adjacent to, or surrounded by the arc.  The associated expansion in 
volume can spread molten metal over quite wide distances” .    
3.2.10.  The New Zealand Fire Service specialist fire investigator c onsidered that “the burn patterns 
were those that would  normally be associated with a high temperature fire such as LPG which 
burns at around 1950 degrees Celsius”.   
3.2.11.  The basket’s stainless steel  framing was severely distorted.  Evidence of electrical arci ng was 
found around the top of the basket piping frame  and on the wire around the bottom of the 
basket frame around the pilot’s compartment that also housed the LPG cylinders .  All but one 
of the support suspension cables running around the basket were  intact . That one cable  had 
indications of electrical arcing.  
3.2.12.  The fire specialist noted that the 4 fuel cylinders all “showed signs of extreme heat which had 
melted the aluminium fittings.  None of the cylinders showed signs of expansion due to 
internal pr essure .  This would indicate that the gas most probably vented th rough their 
pressure relief valves”.   One of the cylinders had a small hole near the base that looked as if it 
had been  caused by  electrical arcing. This was determined to be the origin of th e fire.  
3.2.13.  The lines company’s electrical protection trip records confirmed that the short circuiting and 
arcing occurred at 0722: 17.  The type of circuit trip also confirmed that the balloon basket 
had been part of the conduction path between 2 of the 33  kV wires.   
3.2.14.  All the fuel hoses and fittings to connect the cylinders to the burners were accounted for .  The 
lever -style tap fittings for each of the cylinders were dismantled to confirm the position s of the 
taps.  The taps of the 2 inboard LPG cylinders  closest to the centre of the basket were 
determined to be in the OFF or CLOSED position .  The cylinder that had the small puncture 
hole in it  was also CLOSED .  The tap of the fourth cylinder was determined to be OPEN. There 
were 2 cross -feed valves , one be tween the 2 burners and the second  between the 2 outboard 
cylinders .  Both  were found to be CLOSED.   
3.2.15.  The on-board fire extinguisher was found severely damaged with the handle/nozzle assembly 
broken off and the bottle depleted of its contents.  The release  pin was found still inserted into 
the activation handle.   Also found was the partially burnt aircraft flight manual, Issue 10 dated 
10 April 2006 , pre any amendments .

 Final report 12 -001 3.2.16.  The envelope was severely damaged by fire and heat, and possibly also by the retardant used 
to extinguish the fire s.  A balloon envelope is constructed of several types of material , and 
possibly different colours of the same material, all of which deteriorate at varying rates  with 
time, heat and exposure to the elements .  To obtai n an indication of the condition of the 
envelope prior to the fire, sev eral samples of the lesser damaged material  were removed from 
points around the envelope and examin ed.  The examination included checking the porosity9 
of the material using approved  equipment .  The samples generally performed well in strength 
and either exceeded or were close to the minimu m porosity specification s considered viable 
for flight.10

Weather  
3.2.17.  The weather conditions were described by witnesses as fine with little or no wind .  The ground 
crew members and other local balloonists spoken to thought  the conditions that morning were 
suitable for ballooning.   
3.2.18.  The weather data recorded at 6 weather stations positioned in vineyards located around 
Carterton was obtained.  At 10 -minute intervals t he weather stations recorded the 
temperature, rainfall, humidity, average wind direction and s peed and maximum wind strength 
during that 10 -minute period.  At 0600 the temperature recorded at the 6 stations varied 
between 9  and 13.1  degrees  Celsius and the humidity ranged from 81% to 100%.  At 0720 
the temperature s had increased to between 12. 6 and 14.1  degrees  Celsius.  The humidity 
also increased generally to between 86% and 100%.  
3.2.19.  Three of the stations recorded calm conditions for the duration of the flight.  Two of the 
stations recorded occasional “gusts” of between 0.9 and 5 km per hour.  The s ixth station 
recorded average winds of between 1.2 and 7.3 km per hour and gusts of 5.2 -11.4 km per

 hour.  The wind direction was mostly from the north -east but did swing around to the south 
and west occasionally.  
3.3. Operator information  
3.3.1.  Ballooning New Zealand Limited was owned by the pilot, who had a contract with Early 
Morning Balloons Limited  to fly ZK-XXF.  Ballooning New Zealand was therefore the operator of 
ZK-XXF.  The pilot was a director of Ballooning New Zealand  and he employe d the ground crew . 
The pilot was responsible for the safe management of the operation, staff and passengers.  
The pilot was also responsible for facilitat ing any routine and non-routine maintenance on the 
balloon.  The pilot  would normally inform the owner be fore any maintenance action was 
undertaken.  
3.3.2.  The pilot  had produced a range of company documentation for  Ballooning New Zealand .  
These included a  health and safety policy, a code of safe conduct , an employment job 
description and procedures for employees .  The pilot also had several local area maps  
showing areas to avoid and hazards, including power lines.   The maps  were typically used by 
the pilot to brief  other  pilots  attending the annual local  balloon fiesta , for which the pilot had 
previously been  the safety officer . 
3.3.3.  Crew members reported that the pilot  normal ly used the 2 inboard cylinders first and switch ed 
over to the 2 outboard cylinders when descending or about to descend in preparation for 
landing.  The cylinders were normally refilled after each flight.  Refuelling records showed that 
between 140 and 175 litres of fuel (LPG) had been  consumed on each of the previous  10 
flights , the actual usage being depend ent on the  duration of the flight , passenger load and 
ambient temperature.  The highe st fuel usage was no ted for  flights where between 8 and 10 
passengers were carried.  
3.3.4.  The owner of ZK -XXF had in the few weeks preceding the accident discussed with the pilot the 
possib ility of expanding the owner’s  business interests  On  the Friday before the accident  the 
owner had contacted  the pilot again  by email and advised that they were  planning to take 
back possession of the balloon . Refer to paragraph 3. 5.2 for further comment.  
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The pilot  was 53 years old.  He  held commercial helicopter and commercial balloon pilot 
licences.  He  ran 2 logbooks, one for his helicopter flying and a second  for his balloon flying.  
His first balloon logbook could not be located, but a witness thought he had started his 
balloon flyi ng in the mid -1980s.  CAA records show ed he had obtained his commercial pilot 
licence (balloon) on 23 June 1995.  The pilot’s current balloon logbook had commenced  on 17 
May 2006, by which time it record ed that he had accumulated 677 hours flying balloons.   
3.4.2.  The pilot had started flying commercial balloon flights for the o wner in about 1997, initially 
flying ZK -EMB, a Thunder and Colt 160A balloon.11  In 2001 he had started flying ZK -XXF and 
by 7 January 201 2 had accumulated about 215 hours on this balloon.  He also flew 7 hours 
on another Cameron Balloons A210 balloon  while ZK -XXF was undergoing maintenance work.   
At the time of the accident the pilot had accumulated a total of 1286 flying hours, comprising 
226 hours flying helicopters and 1060 hours flying balloons.   
3.4.3.  The pilot typically flew about 70 hours per year, concentrated around the January to April 
period.  He had flown 7 balloon flights in December 2011, including 3 flights in ZK -XXF on 24, 
27 and 28 December  with 7 or 8 passengers .  The pilot had last flown  ZK-XXF on 3 January 
2012  on a local flight with 7 passengers .  The following day he had flown  3 passengers in a 
smaller balloon , landing near a road  2 km to the north -east of Somerset Road.   The most 
recent  flight with 11 persons on board had been  on 28 August 2011.   
3.4.4.  The pilot’s logbook recorded that on 5 occasions since August 2006 the landing location had 
been  Somerset Road;  the most recent had been on  23 September 2011.   
                                                        
11 See section 3.7 for more information about balloons a nd the different types.  

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report 12 -001 3.4.5.  The Commission recei ved information that t he pilot had been  on board a balloon that 
contacted  power lines  in about 1999 .  The C AA advised that it had n o record or knowledge  of 
the alleged incident .  Powerco records confirmed  that a balloon had struck 11  kV wires near 
Masterton on 26 March 1999, and the pilot of ZK -XXF was one of the occupants of the 
balloon.  Further enquiries confirmed  that the incident had taken  place during a balloon fiesta 
in Wairarapa and that the pilot had been  a passenger.   During take -off a win d gust had pushed 
the small 2-person balloon onto a nearby power line.  As the balloon lifted free of the wires 
there had been  an arcing that caus ed a “small burn ma rk on the side of the basket”.  
3.4.6.  The pilot’s most recent biennial flight review had been  on 1 4 January 2010  and his  last Class 
1 medical certificate had been  issued on 25 November 2010.  A Class 1 medical certificate 
would normally have  a valid ity period of  6 months for pilots aged 40 years and over (CAA, 
2007).  However, certain commercial activities, including sightseeing flights in hot -air balloons 
by day, were exempted from being classified  as commercial transport operations (CAA, 2008).  
The pilot’s medical certificate for ballooning had therefore been valid for one year, until 25 
Novemb er 2011.  This meant  that his medical certificate had expired 6 weeks before the 
accident.   
3.4.7.  The medical examiner who had completed the certificate said that as part of his call -up 
system he had contacted the pilot before his medical certificate was due to  expire.  The 
medical examiner recalled making an appointment that he thought the pilot  later cancelled.  
He had not follow ed this up because he  thought the pilot may have completed his examination 
elsewhere , which  had occasionally happened.  
3.4.8.  The medical questionnaire completed by the pilot on 18 November 2010 as part of his 
examination contained a section title d “Medical History: Have you ever experienced any of the 
following? ”.  For the question on “Use of legal or illegal recreational drugs or substances”, the 
pilot had circled N for No .  For the section on smoking the pilot had recorded that he had 
smoked for 3 years but not within the previous  12 months.   
3.4.9.  Medical evidence was provided that the pilot suffered from  gout.  Gout is a joint inflamm ation 
(arthritis) and often affects parts of the foot .  Gout can cause sudden bouts of pain and 
swelling.  The medical examiner was aware that the pilot suffered from gout, but otherwise 
considered he was a very fit person.  This assessment was supported b y the pilot’s general 
practitioner and others who knew him.  On the morning of the accident the pilot was seen by 
the ground crew and s everal witnesses to be hobbling slightly.  Those who knew him thought 
this was caused by the gout.  The pilot was not kno wn to  have any medical condition that 
should have affected his ability to pilot a balloon.  
3.5. Toxicology  
3.5.1.  On 11 January 2012 the pathologist sent blood12 and urine samples taken from the pilot ’s 
body to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR) for analysis  as part 
of the post -mortem .  On 16 March 2012 a report was received  from ESR  showing a positive 
result for THC  with a reading of 2 µg/l of blood .  THC is a constituent of cannabis.   As a 
consequence of the findings in the ESR rep ort, the pilot’s 24 -hour history before the flight was 
reviewed.  
24-hour history  
3.5.2.  The pilot, i n addition to his flying duties, was also a local truancy officer .  Because of the 
school holidays he was not working in this capacity in the days before the accid ent.  On the 
morning before the accident the owner of ZK -XXF sent a follow -up email  to the pilot , again 
advising that they were planning to expand their own business interests.  As part of that 
expansion they intended to take possession of the balloon, pos sibly towards the end of May.  
The pilot met with his partner later that day and discussed the possibility of purchasing a 
replacement balloon.  The freelance photographer was also present for part of the discussion. 
The pilot and his partner again discuss ed the subject after returning home at about 1715.   
                                                        
12 See Appendix 4 regarding comment on the quality of the blood sample examined by ESR.  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 13 >>
 3.5.3.  At about 1 830 on 6 January 2012, the pilot visited a friend to discuss matters around the 
purchase of a replacement balloon.  He returned home at about 2000, had dinner, and at 
about 2100 went to bed in preparation for the early morning flight.  The pilot’s partner and the 
friend he visited both commented that the pilot had been  positive about continuing the 
ballooning business and , while he may have had a couple of drinks, he had not been 
intoxicated.  Both were also adamant that he had not smoke d any substance in their presence 
or display ed any signs of having recently consumed cannabis.   
3.5.4.  At about 0520  on 7 January 2012 , the pilot left his home for the shed where the balloon was 
located, arriving there about 5 minutes later.  The 2 ground crew arrived there after and , with 
the pilot , went about their duties preparing for the flight.  The pilot discussed the probable 
return of the balloon to its owner with the ground crew  and photographer .  Two of those 
persons said that the pilot  was not happy about returning the balloon but  appeared positive 
about continuing with ballooning.  The 3 stated that the pilot  showed no signs of having 
consumed cannabis  that morning .  The times recorded above are approximate but there was 
nothing reported to be untoward or unusual in the pilot’s behaviour on the morning of the 
accident.  
3.5.5.  At about 0605  the pilot was observed standing on a balcony of a building by 2 witnesses who 
had gathered with the passengers betwe en 20 m and 30 m away.  Behind the balcony was a 
staff room with toilets at the back.  The pilot was the only person present that morning who 
had a key to the building and the code to disable the security system.  Company records 
show ed that the security s ystem was disabled at 0602 and reset at 0608.  Two passengers 
were seen exiting the building, and it was the noise of the door closing behind them that 
attracted the attention of the 2 witnesses.   
3.5.6.  The 2 witnesses who saw the pilot on the balcony were inte rviewed separately, initially by the 
Police, then by a Commission investigat or and on 21 March 2013 by the Commission .  The 2 
witnesses had both  known the pilot by sight and were able to identify him  clearly  from their 
position about 25 m away.  They indep endently confirmed that he had had something in his 
right hand that he put to his mouth.  Smoke was then seen rising from his mouth or head 
area.  The witnesses were confident that it was smoke and not water vapour as no -one had 
seen vapour being emitted from the people present that morning.  The pilot had what 
appeared to be a cup in his left hand, but did not take it to his mouth.  A clipboard or 
something similar was seen under his left arm.  The 2 witnesses both thought the pilot was 
having a regular c igarette , so thought nothing more of it and did not continue to observe him.  
3.5.7.  As a result of receiving the draft report a further 3 witnesses took issue with the testimony of 
the first 2 witnesses.  The further 3 witnesses did not believe the pilot had been  smoking on 
the balcony.  The Commissioners conducted interviews with these other 3 witnesses as well.  
Toxicology  reports  
3.5.8.  Following receipt of the initial ESR report , further testing of the pilot’s urine sample showed a 
THC-acid level of 120 -130 micrograms per litre.  The updated report, dated 23 May 2012, was 
then provided to the Commission.  The ESR report s by the forensic toxicologist (ESR 
toxicologist) had been  peer reviewed.  The full ESR report can be found in Appendix 1.   
3.5.9.  The ESR report  stated that:  
Under normal conditions a blood THC level of 2 micrograms per litre would be 
consistent with [the pilot]  smoking the equivalent of a single cannabis cigarette 
within 5 hours prior to death.  Blood THC levels may remain elevated for a longer 
period if cannabis is used frequently.   
3.5.10.  The ESR report further stated that no medicinal drugs that affect the mind, al ter mood or 
cause sleep were detected in the blood, and no common analgesic medication was detected.  
Also there was no evidence of the use of amphetamine -type stimulants, opiate -type drugs or 
cocaine.  An alcohol reading of 5 milligrams per 100 millilitre s of urine was found, but no 
alcohol was detected in the blood .  The report stated that: “Low levels of alcohol may be due 
to means other than deliberate ingestion ” [principally decomposition] . 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final report 12 -001 3.5.11.  In commenting on the results, the ESR report stated:  
Cannabis cannot be easily classified as a sedative or stimulant since it can have 
different effects in different people and its effects generally vary over time.  Its main 
psychological and behavioural effects are euphoria and rela xation, an impairment of 
perception and cognition, and loss of motor coordination.    
Subjective symptoms of cannabis intoxication usually peak 10 to 15 minutes after 
smoking cannabis and last 1.5 to 4 hours.  
Blood THC levels produced by smoking a cannabis cigarette and the rate at  which 
the levels decrease vary widely between individuals and are dependent  on a number 
of factors.  These factors include frequency of use, smoking technique and 
experience, and size and potency of the cannabis cigarette.   
Blood THC levels are generally  a poor indicator of cannabis intoxication.  It is not 
usually possible to determine whether a subject was intoxicated based on blood 
levels alone.  Because of the degree of trauma sustained I cannot be confident that 
the level of THC detected in the blood  sample accurately reflects the level present 
immediately prior to death.  However, a level of 2 micrograms per litre indicates 
recent use and it is possible that [the pilot] was affected by the drug at the time of 
the crash.  
Peak levels of THC -acid occur in the urine within 6 hours after smoking cannabis.  
Because THC is absorbed into the fatty tissues and slowly excreted as THC -acid, high 
levels of THC -acid may be detected in the urine of frequent users for several days.  
3.5.12.  The Commission sent the ESR toxico logy report and autopsy report to Dr Shelley Robertson, an 
expert in forensic medicine and pathology in Melbourne, Australia , for an independent review.  
After reviewing the ESR and autopsy reports  and other information , Dr Robertson  expressed 
the followin g written opinion:   
In general I agree with the comments regarding interpretation of the results of 
toxicological analysis made by [name deleted] of ESR Laboratories.  She states 
“Because of the degree of trauma sustained I cannot be confident that the level of 
THC detected i n the blood sample accurately reflects the level present immediately 
prior to death.”  Interpretation of THC levels in post-mortem  blood specimens is 
problematic, particularly (as in the present case) if the specimen is suboptimal (ie 
cavity blood from an extensively traumatised body).  Other factors include the 
possible post -mortem redistribution of THC in blood (from tissue stores of the 
compound).  The finding of a level, however of 2 μg/l [2 micrograms per litre ] in 
blood, strongly suggests recent use o f cannabis by the deceased in the hours prior 
to the accident.  This is supported by the presence of THC -acid in the urine.   
The effects of cannabis use in an individual are extremely variable and include such 
factors as history of usage (that is, chronic as opposed to ‘one -off’).  Some research 
suggests that a blood level of 5 μg/l and above causes cognitive impairment 
however blood levels of THC tend to decline quite rapidly after use (several hours) 
whilst studies have shown (specifically flight simulato r studies in pilots) that 
cognitive deficits can persist at least up to 24 hours following cannabis use (the 
‘carry -over effect’).  This leads to the conclusion that direct correlation of cognitive 
impairment with blood levels of THC is also problematic.  
The testing of the blood and urine specimens obtained from the deceased, [name 
deleted] by ESR Labora tories was directed at the active metabolite of cannabis, that 
is ∆9 -THC.  Levels of this compound give the best indication of recent usage, unlike 
the inac tive metabolite,  11-nor-∆-tetra hydrocannabinol -9-carboxylic acid (THC acid) 
which  can persist in blood and urine for days following cannabis use and has not 
been demonstrated to correlate with cognitive impairment at all.  
3.5.13.  In conclusion Dr Robertson  wrote:   
In co nclusion, the pilot of this hot -air balloon, which crashed resulting in the death of 
all persons on board, was shown to have the active metabolite of cannabis in blood 
at a level  of 2 μg/l .  Whilst this level may not accurately reflect the actual blood level 
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 15 >>
 at the time of death, it strongly suggests recent cannabis use (4 -6 hours prior to 
death).  This in turn suggests that at the time of use (within the 4 -6 hour time -frame) 
the blood leve ls of THC would have been much higher and the likelihood of cognitive 
impairment also high.  Cognitive impairment at or around the time of the accident 
cannot be excluded, given the ‘carry -over’ effect of cannabis.  
The testing of the specimens by ESR Labor atories and the report issued including 
the comments by [name deleted] appear to be entirely appropriate.   
3.5.14.  Dr Robert son’s full opinion can be found in Appendix 2.  
3.5.15.  The pilot was reported to be a “social drinker” only and, with the exception of a cigar at 
Christmas, did not smoke tobacco.  He was known by 2 people close to him to smoke the 
“occasional ” cannabis cigarette.  Those 2 people also acknowledged that they could only 
comment on what they knew about.  As neither of the 2 spoken to were with the pilot all of the 
time, they were unwilling  to say how often he smoked cannabis in any one day, or how many 
days in a typical week  or weeks .  They both thought that he would not smoke cannabis so 
soon before flying as to cause concern.  They considered he was a r esponsible pilot who would 
not fly while under the influence of the drug.  Both spoken to had known the pilot for a long 
time.  
3.5.16.  New Zealand Police, on behalf of the Coroner , sought independen t advice from another 
forensic pathologist with expertise in forensic toxicology  (hereafter refe rred to as the “Police 
expert ”).  The Police also requested ESR to conduct additional testing .  The second ESR report 
can be found in Appendix 1.  The Commission obtained a copy of  the Police expert ’s report , 
which can be found in Appendix 3 .  The Police expert was working on the information given to 
him by the Police that the pilot was a regular user of cannabis and had been for a long period 
of time.  The Police expert  took that to mean  that the pilot was a “chronic” cann abis user and 
based his opinion on that assertion.  The following are relevant excerpts  from his report:  
Opinion  
1. The information as provided supports the fact that [ the pilot] was a chronic 
user of cannabis  
2. The information provided can not  prove or exclude that [the pilot]  had 
ingested cannabis in the hours prior to the balloon crash.  
3. The information can not prove the notion that [the pilot]  was under the 
influence of cannabis at the time of the crash.  
When interpreting  post-mortem toxicolo gy you must consider whether the person is a 
naïve user, intermittent  [user] or chronic user of the drug.  When looking at a value 
of 2 micrograms per litre (that is 2 parts per million) of THC in such a sample under 
these conditions, you cannot draw a fir m conclusion of acute exposure in a person 
known to be a chronic user of cannabis, as was [the pilot].  The 2 micrograms may 
well be stored THC from previous exposures that redistributed and/or leached from 
fat stores during decomposition.  It is entirely possible that if a blood sample was 
drawn from [the pilot] minutes before he lifted off that morning, it may have shown 
levels of THC less than 2 micrograms per litre in his blood.  
You could infer that it represents recent use in a person known not to take  cannabis, 
or take it on an infrequent basis.   You simply cannot infer that it represents recent 
use in a chronic user.  The THCCOOH in urine is known to be detectable for many 
days after the last exposure in a chronic user, up to 10 -13 days after the last  use. 
Their suggestions [ESR ’s and the Commission’s independent forensic toxicologists] 
cannot be disproven beyond scientific and medical certainty due to the problematic 
delay between the [accident] and the recovery of the post -mortem samples.  In the 
four days between the incident and retrieval of the blood sample upon which the 
toxicity is based,  the vital information that may have answered this pivotal question 
was irr etrievably lost.  
In order to address the allegation that [the pilot] was smoking ei ther a cigarette or 
something else just before the balloon took off, I requested that cotinine (found in 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final report 12 -001 urine of tobacco smokers) be looked for in his urine and this proved negative, 
supporting the assertion that [the pilot] did not smoke tobacco.  
Conclus ions:   
 
The toxicology results from the  decomposing samples taken from [the pilot] three 
days after the balloon crash support the established fact that he was a chronic 
smoker of cannabis (THCCOOH in urine) and he did not smoke tobacco.  The results 
do not  prove that he smoked cannabis on the morning of the flight.  It is entirely 
probable that he did not smoke cannabis for several days prior to the incident .  
There is no definitive evidence to suggest he was under the influence of THC at the 
time of the in cident and the THC found may well have resulted from post -mortem 
redistribution.  The THC does not prove recent use in a chronic user (i.e. within a 4 -6 
hour timeframe).  
If there is still a question as to whether [the pilot] smoked cannabis in full view of  
ground crew and customers that morning then these results cannot disprove it 
beyond doubt.  
Toxicology review    
3.5.17.  On 2 April 2013 the Commission invited the 3  experts  to review the toxicology results and their  
reports, given that their reports had been prepared without knowing  that the pilot was seen 
smoking some 20 -25 minutes before commencing the flight and that it “was highly likely ” to 
have been cannabis  that he was smoking .  The conclusions  by ESR and Dr Robertson  are 
summarised in the following par agraphs.  Their full responses  can be found in Appendix 4.  
The Police expert  declined to provide any further comment on the results.    
3.5.18.  ESR’s opinion was that the  level found would normally indicate recent use of the drug, 
anywhere from 0.5 to 5 hours, and  could be consist ent with the pilot smoking cannabis 90 
minutes prior to his death.  However, the use of cannabis at an earlier time could not  be ruled 
out. 
3.5.19.  Dr Robertson said  that although  “the actual blood level of the sample used for analysis cannot 
be clearly determined  by this result , the facts remain that the pilot was a cannabis user and 
cognitive impairment at or around the time of the accident and it s contribution to the cause of 
the accident, cannot be excluded, given the  ‘carry -over’ effect of ca nnabis ”.      
3.6. Performance -impairing substances  
3.6.1.  Civil Aviation Rule 19.7 stated that:  
No crew member while acting in his or her official capacity shall be in a state of 
intoxication or in a state of health in which his or her capacity so to act would be 
impaired by reason of his or her having consumed or used any intoxicant, sedative,  
narcotic, or stimulant drug or preparation . (CAA, 2010)  
3.6.2.  In 2004 the A TSB completed a study of cannabis and its effects on pilot performance (ATSB, 
2004).  The executive sum mary to the study stated that:  
Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug, which has widespread effects 
within the body.  Smoking is the most common form of administration.  The adverse 
effects of cannabis on behaviour, cognitive function and psychomot or performance 
are dose -dependent and related to task difficulty.  Complex tasks such as driving or 
flying are  particularly sensitive to the performance impairing effects of cannabis . 
Chronic cannabis use is associated with a number of adverse health effects, and 
there is evidence suggesting the development of tolerance to chronic use as well as 
a well -defined withdrawal syndrome.  There is also evidence that the residual effects 
of can nabis can last up to 24 hours.  Significantly, the modern dose of cannabis is 
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 17 >>
 much more potent than in the past, when the majority of the research was 
conducted.  As such, the reported adverse health effects may be conservative.13   
Although only a limited number of studies have exami ned the effects of cannabis on 
pilot performance, the results overall have been consistent.  Flying skills deteriorate, 
and the number of minor and major errors committed by t he pilot increase, while at 
the same time the pilot i s often unaware of any performance problems.  Cannabis 
use in a pilot is therefore a significant flight safety hazard.   
3.6.3.  The ATSB study made reference to numerous other studies and reference material.  Some of 
the key findings contained in the study are id entified below.  
Cannabis contains over 400 chemical compounds, including over 60 
pharmacological active constituents known as cannabinoids.  The most potent and 
psychoactive of these is Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9 -THC).  Cannabinoids act on 
those parts of the brain related to cognitive processes, memory, pain perception and 
psychomotor coordination.  
Cannabis produces a wide range of effects and shares some of the properties of 
alcohol and other drugs such as tranquillisers and opiates.  Some of the effects 
include perceptual alterations like colour, tastes, smell and time distortion, impaired 
attention and learning, increased reaction time and difficulty in concentration.  The 
ability to perform complex tasks requiring attention and mental coordination were 
“particularly sensitive to the effects of marijuana”.  
The smoking of cannabis, in addition to being the most common form of 
administering the drug, promotes the rapid onset of symptoms, with the effects of 
THC becoming perceptible after a few seconds and fully apparent in minutes.  The 
impairment of performance and skills was at a maximum in the first 4 hours after 
taking cannabis.  The residual adverse effects of cannabis were shown to last 
between 12 and 24 hours, even after as little as a single dose.  The more complex 
the tasks, the more pronounced were the effects, especially on cognitive function.  A 
study in the United States using aircraft simulators supported this finding (Leirer, 
1989).   
3.6.4.  The Commission has investigated 6 occur rences in the past 1 0 years, including in the rail and 
marine modes, where crew members and others in safety -critical roles were found to have 
taken performance -impairing  substances in the hours or days leading up to the accident s 
(TAIC, 2002 , 2009 , 2011 and 2012 ).  The aviation occur rences included another Part 119 
adventure activity (TAIC, 2010) and a commercial air transport flight (TAIC, 2005).  While 
substance impairment could not be identified as a primary cause in any of these occurrences , 
the Commission s ees the use of these substances by personnel responsible for performing 
safety -critical tasks as a transport -wide safety issue.  
3.6.5.  The Commission has made several recommendation s relating to drug and alcohol detection 
and deterrence regime s for persons employed in safety -critical transport roles.  More 
information on these recommendations is given in the analysis section of this report.  
3.7. Aircraft information  
3.7.1.  A complete balloon comprises the envelope, the basket and the fuel and burner assembly.  A 
single company can manufacture all the components and offer them as a complete set or, if 
within the performance or type certificate limits for the balloon, the  manufacturer  may permit 
alternative components to be used.  In New Zealand, the CAA registration is held agains t the 
enve lope.  
3.7.2.  ZK-XXF was a Cameron Balloons A210 balloon envelope, serial number 4300, manufactured 
in the United Kingdom in 1997 and first registered there in 1998 as G -BXXF.  The designation 
A210 referred to the conventional shape of the envelope and its capacity of 2 10 000 cubic 
feet (about 6000 cubic metres).  The manufacturer advised that the envelope was similar to 
                                                        
13 The potency of cannabis has increased by as much as 15 times in the past 30 years ( Aldington, ND) . 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final report 12 -001 the Z -210, which measured 25  m in height and had a diameter of 23.5  m.  The envelope was 
purchased by its New Zealand owner in 2001 to replace the Thund er and Colt14 160A.   
3.7.3.  The Thunder and Colt 160A envelope  had been  manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1989 
as a complete balloon – envelope, basket, 2 primary burners, one commercial liquid fire 
burner and 4 approximately 46-kilogram ( kg) capacity LPG fue l cylinders .  Th at balloon  was 
given serial number 1377 and  sold to a Canadian operator in 1989 and registered as C -FFEV.  
A photograph of it is shown in Figure 1 .  In 1996 t he complete balloon was imported into  New 
Zealand and registered as ZK -EMB.  When the envelope reached the end of its economic life 
in 2001, it was replaced with the Cameron Balloons A210 envelope and registered as ZK -
XXF.15 
3.7.4.  The basket measured 2.6  m long, 1.52  m wide and 1.125  m high  (see Figure 4).  The pilot’s 
compartment was at one end and contained the fuel cylinders , fuel hoses, fittings , 
instruments, a 1 kg powder fire extinguisher and other equipment.  The equipment carried in 
ZK-XXF met the requirements specified in the balloon  flight manua l.  Other equipment 
included a n emergency lighter should the pilot lights for the burners extinguish , and a drop -
line that could be dropped to persons on the ground to  pull the balloon to a safe area should it 
become becalmed near obstacles.   The pilot had  also installed a small aluminium platform  to 
provide eas y access to the burner controls.  
3.7.5.  The pilot’s compartment  was at the head of  a “T” shaped divider that ran along the cent re of 
the basket , dividing the passenger area into 2 sections.  The basket was of conventional cane 
and wicker construction with a metal frame and a heavy -duty plywood floor supported by 
runners and steel wire .  The steel wire  looped under  the basket  and was a ttach ed through 4 
support rods to the burner or “load” frame  above the occupants .  The envelope was attached 
to the burner frame through “flying cables” that ran from the envelope down to karabiners on 
the frame.  Rope handles were located inside the basket for passengers to hold on  to during 
landing.  Some pilots w ore harness es to ensure they remained on  board should the basket tip 
over on landing.  Harnesses were not mandatory and n o harness was carried on ZK -XXF.   
3.7.6.  Padd ing was fitted to the top of the basket , allowing occupants  to lean on it for a better view 
and to help entry to and exit  from  the basket  using steps located at each end .  Padding also 
covered the 4 support rods  attaching the basket to the burner frame .  The burners were 
mounted within the frame and were connected to the fuel cylinders  by flexible hoses that ran 
down 2 of the support rods  to the 4 fuel cylinders  located on 2 sides  of the pilot’s 
compartment.   Connectors and 2  cross -feed valves  allowed the burners to be supplie d from 
any one or a combination of cylinders .  Fuel flow from  the cylinders  could be shut off using a  
single -action tap located on the top of each cylinder .  Any fuel remaining in the lines after the 
tap had been turned off was vented through the burners.  (See Figure 4 .) 
3.7.7.  The envelope was fitted with vents around the  sides  to turn the balloon in either direction .  
The vents were controlled by green and black coloured ropes or lines running down to the 
pilot’s compartment .  Th e vents  enable d the pilot to rotate the balloon and orientate the 
basket correctly for landing.  The basket was fitted with 2 runners or support beams along one 
side to strengthen that side should the basket tip over on landing , which was a  not uncommon 
occurrence for balloon s, even in light winds.  In preparation for landing the pilot would  rotate 
the balloon to face the side with the runners in the direction of flight.  The o peration of the 
turning vents released hot air from the envelope and therefore  reduced lift and caused the 
balloon  to descend.  According to the owner, between 20 and 3 0 seconds were needed to 
rotate the balloon through 360  degrees .   
3.7.8.  A “parachute valve ” in the top of the envelope was able to be opened  to release  hot air and  
descend the balloon.  Th e valve wa s controlled by a red -and-white -coloured line connected to 
the pilot’s end of the basket .  The balloon was also fitted with a rapid deflation system , which , 
as the name suggests, enabled the rapid deflation of the envelope in an emergency descent 
                                                        
14 Thunder and Colt was purchased by Cameron Balloons in 1995.  
15 The type certificate and registration applied to the envelope only.  Different equipment, including baskets, 
burners and gas bottles, could be fitted if approved by the type certificate for the envelope.  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 19 >>
 or after landing in strong winds.  The rapid deflation system was operated by pulling on a red -
coloured rope  commonly called a rip line .  The flight manual  stated that “use of the rip line is 
not permitted at heights greater than 2  m (6  ft) above ground level, except in an emergency” . 
3.7.9.  ZK-XXF had a certificated maximum ta ke-off mass of 1905  kg.  As part of the most recent  
annual maintenance check, the weight of the balloon, including full gas cylinders , had been  
calculated at 708 kg.  The passenger load sheet for the accident f light recorded the passenger 
weights.  When  combined with the estimated  weight of the pilot , they  gave a total load figure 
of 791  kg and therefore a take -off weight of 1499  kg.   
 
 
Figure 4 
Basket attached to ZK -XXF 
3.7.10.  On 7 January 2012, for the average  air temperature of 11  degrees  Celsius recorded by local 
vineyards and a launch site elevation of 85  m above sea level, the maximum permitted lift for 
the balloon was determined, using the manufacture r’s performance and load calculator , to be 
1727 kg.  This gave a spare lift capacity of 228  kg for the assumed conditions on the day.  
3.7.11.  Section 3 of the flight manual contained e mergency procedures for the balloon (Cameron 
Balloons, 2010).  Paragraph 3.3 of this section was titled “Contact with Electric Power Lines ” 
and included the following:  
   Contact with electric power wires is ext remely dangerous and can result  in serious or  
fatal injuries.  It should be avoided at all costs.  
   If contact with power wires cannot be avoided, initiate a rapid descent so the contact  
with wires will be made by the envelope instead of the basket assembly.  
   Shut off all fuel supplies at the cyli nder valves and vent the fuel hoses before 
contact.  
   If the balloon is caught in the power wires, do not touch any metallic parts.  
   If the basket is not in contact with the ground remain in  it, if possible, until the  
electrical power is shut off.  
   If it is necessary to leave the basket, do not place the body in contact with the 
ground and any part of the balloon at the same time.  
   Do not attempt to recover the balloon until the electricity authority has been   
contacted, and had indicated that it is  safe to do so.

 Final report 12 -001 3.7.12.  Aircraft records showed that at the time of the accident the ZK -XXF envelope had accrued a 
total of 520 flight hours.  The balloon was required to undergo a maintenance check  every 
100 flight hours or an “Annual Review of Airworthiness” – whichever occurred first.  Records 
showed the balloon had flown about 30 -40 hours each year.  The most recent  combined 
annual and 100-hour check had been  recorded as undertaken on 14 September 2011 when 
the envelope had accrued 512 flight hours.  
3.7.13.  The combin ed check  included the standard Cameron Balloons inspection schedule and the 
CAA’s Review of Airworthiness “Check List Report – Hot Air Balloon”.  The Check List Rep ort 
correctly recorded the manufacturer of the envelope and the model type and serial number.  
The type certificate was erroneously recorded as being B2GL, which was only applicable to 
Cameron Balloons balloons manufactured in the United States  with serial  numbers 5000 and 
higher.  The Cameron Balloons A210  balloon , serial number 4300, had been  manufactured 
against United Kingdom type certificate BB12.  With the inception of the European Aviation 
Safety Agency (EASA), the United Kingdom type certificate BB1 2 was changed to 
EASA.BA.013, and this should have been recorded as the type certificate for  ZK-XXF.  The type 
certificate determined how the aircraft was to be maintained.  This error had continued since 
the envelope was first registered in New Zealand.  Both the basket and burners were recorded 
as being Cameron Balloons products, but they had been  produced by Thunder and Colt.  
Maintenance  
3.7.14.  When first asked about the maintenance schedule for the balloon , the maintenance engineer 
produced  Issue 7 of the manu facturer’s “Flight and Maintenance Manual”, dated 1992.  After 
Issue 7 the manual had been split into 2 separate documents titled “Flight Manual” and 
“Maintenance Manual”.  The maintenance  manual that was current when the most recent 
maintenance had been d one on 14 September 2011 was Issue 10.  The maintainer later 
submitted that he did not hold copies of the maintenance manual and that in preparation for 
any scheduled maintenance he would download the latest issue directly from the 
manufacturer’s website.  However, the aircraft logbook recorded that the inspection on 14 
September 2011 had been done in accordance with the manufacturer’s “Flight and 
Maintenance Manual”, a title not used since Issue 7.  
3.7.15.  Anomalies found in the maintenance logbook includ ed incorr ectly identified components such 
as the basket and burner, and no reference to 4 airworthiness directives .  In 2008 the 4 fuel 
cylinders  had been tested by a local certified gas company, but there was no associated entry 
in the aircraft logbook by a licens ed aircraft engineer that approved the use of the tested 
cylinders  on the balloon . 
3.7.16.  At an initial  interview , the maintenance engineer demonstrated that he had not used the 
prescribed  method , referred to  by the manufacturer as a “grab test” , for testing the strength of 
the envelope fabric .  The prescribed method  involved clamping 2 sections of fabric and pulling 
them apart using a calibrated spring gauge to measure the force applied.  A minimum pull of 
30 pounds (13.6 k g) was required to confirm the serviceab ility of the fabric.  The engineer 
showed how he used his hands to determine the strength of the fabric.  He later advised that 
if there was any doubt about the strength of the fabric he would use the correct equipment.  
The maintenance engineer later subm itted that “at all times, when required, the grab test is 
carried out using the correct tool and calibrated scales in accordance with the approved 
instructions”.  
3.7.17.  The maintenance engineer was the same person who had completed the initial certificate of 
airworthiness inspections of ZK -EMB and ZK -XXF in 1996 and 2001 respectively.  These 
inspections had been  done under a CAA delegation .  A maintenance engineer, when 
performing an airworthiness inspection, must  refer to the aircraft type certificate to ensure 
that the inspection is correctly carried out.  The inspection documentation for both ZK -EMB 
and ZK -XXF did not include  the type certificate  in the allocated space  on the form .  The 
documentation contained other anomalies, including the incorrect model and s erial numbers 
for the burners.  The incorrect and incomplete  documentation had not been identified by the 
CAA when the forms were submitted for  the issue of airworthiness certificate s.

 3.7.18.  The aircraft flight manual found in the wreckage, Issue 10 dated 10 April 2006, was the 
incorrect version.  The version current at the time of the accident was Issue 10 , Amendment 9, 
dated 2 March 2011 .  As part of an Annual Review of Airworthiness, the inspecting authority, 
in this case the maintenance en gineer , was required to confirm that the correct flight manual 
was carried on board the balloon.  On the 14 September 2011 inspection form the 
maintenance engineer had written “Y” [yes] in the box titled “Current?” for the aircraft flight 
manual.  
3.7.19.  In Decemb er 2011 several of the envelope panels on ZK -XXF had been  damaged and 
subsequently repaired.  The repair had been  completed by the owner of the balloon , who had 
previously undertaken  a Cameron Balloons repair course and was therefore permitted to 
undertake  the repair.  Civil Aviation Rule 43.69 “Maintenance records” directed that an entry 
be made in the aircraft logbook describing any damage, what had been  done to rectify the 
damage, what approved technical data had been  followed, and who had performed the repair.  
The logbook entry was to be made by a licensed maintenance engineer  with the appropriate 
rating.   The aircraft logbook for ZK -XXF contained no reference to the damage  or the  
subsequent repair.  
3.7.20.  As a result of its initial enquiries into  the maintenance system for the balloon, the Commission 
made an urgent safety recommendation to the Director of Civil Aviation to address these 
maintenance issues .  See section 7 of this report for the full text and the Director’s response.   
See also section 6 on subsequent safety actions completed by the CAA. 
3.7.21.  The maintenance records held by the CAA for 8 other Cameron balloons were reviewed.  Of the 
8 balloons , 7 had no type certificate number s entered on the initial certificate of airworthiness 
inspection documentation.  A number of the balloons were missing type certificate numbers 
on their early Annual Review of Airworthiness forms and one was incorrectly entered on the 
aircraft register as being manufactured by Cameron Balloons United States when it was a 
United Kingdom product.  The review showed that in the previous  3 years the level of attention 
to detail on the inspection forms had increased significantly, with no anomalies noted after 
2009. 
3.8. Recorde d data  
3.8.1.  The pilot had attached a GPS unit to the basket t o record the track and timing of each balloon 
flight .  The unit was severely damaged during the accident .  It was sent to the ATSB in 
Canberra for examination.  The ATSB was able to locate the memory chip  and extract data for 
some 31 track plots  from the last flight , commencing from take -off.  However, because of the 
way the GPS unit processed and stored data , about the last 10 minutes of the flight  were  not 
recoverable.   
3.8.2.  The GPS track followed the flight  path  shown in Figure 5.  After lift -off the balloon averaged a 
groundspeed of about 10  km per hour as it climbed steadily to an altitude of about 47 0 m.  At 
0709,  as the balloon a pproach ed State Highway 2 , the balloon descended to about 244 m .  
During  the next 2 minutes , as the balloon passed near the intersection of State Highway 2 and 
Somerset Road, it climbed to about 594 m .  The last record ed data  was at 0711:07 near the 
intersection of State Highway 2 and Somerset Road.  Shortly after that the balloon was seen to 
start descending in a s outh -easterly direction  close to  Somerset Road and towards the 
accident area  (see Figures 5 and 6).  The remainde r of the flight path was calculated from 
witness accounts and photographic evidence.  
3.8.3.  In addition to the photographs taken by the freelance photographer, photographs from a 
passenger’s camera were recovered.  These latter photographs recorded the preparatio n and 
inflation of the balloon prior to take -off and portions of the flight until less than a minute 
before the basket struck the power line.  
3.8.4.  The photographs revealed  nothing untoward occurr ing in the basket during the flight.  Both 
sets of photographs showed that the balloon was rotated  or turned  as it crossed Somerset 
Road and flew north -east before turning  back south -west towards Somerset Road.  As the 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report 12 -001 balloon entered the silage paddock, t he runners16 on the landing side of the basket faced east 
towards t he power line it later struck.   This placed the pilot at the front end of the basket 
closest to the power line running along  Somerset Road.

 3.9. Balloon ing information  
3.9.1.  There are 2 main types of balloon: gas balloons, which use gases l ike hydrogen and helium, 
and hot -air balloons .  ZK-XXF was a hot -air balloon.  Hot -air balloons  are most efficient in 
cooler temperatures, where less heat has to be generated to lift a given weight.  Calm 
conditions are also preferred during the take -off and landing phases of flight.  Ballooning 
therefore mostly takes place in the early morning and to a lesser extent in the evening.   
3.9.2.  The m ovement of a balloon over the ground is dictated by the direction taken by the mass of 
air it is in at the time;  that is, the wind at th at height.  B y applying heat to the envelope , the  
pilot of a hot -air balloon can  climb in an attempt to find air that is moving faster or in a 
different direction.  Similarly, by letting the air in the envelope cool, the balloon w ill descend.  A 
pilot therefore has limited control over the direction of flight.   
3.9.3.  The a ctivation of the burners does not cause a balloon to climb  immediately .  A number of 
factors can delay a climb .  These  include the rate at which heat is applied  (one or 2 burners) , 
the load carried and the ambient temperature.  The delay can be in the tens of seconds .  It 
also takes more energy and time to overcome descent inertia before the balloon start s to 
climb .  In other words, if the balloon is descending when the pilot applies the burners, it will 
take more time to arrest the descent before the ballo on begins to climb.  If the ambient 
(outside) air temperature increases later in the morning, more energy will be required to 
increase the temperature of the air inside the envelope to maintain the temperature 
difference required for the balloon to fly .  
3.9.4.  The balloon is descended  by allowing the air in the envelope to cool .  However, a more rapid 
descent can be initiated using  the venting system, for example the parachute valve.  In stable 
flight pilots will therefore generally apply short bursts of heat to either maintain level or hold 
steady climbs and descents.  
3.9.5.  Most balloons, especially those with large baskets, ha ve vents fitted to the side of the 
envelope s that permit the balloon s to be rotated for landing , as described in paragraph 3. 7.7.  
A pilot might also  rotate a balloon in order to get a clear view ahead  or to rotate a n advertising 
logo towards a crowd.   For some envelopes the turning vents are located close together , and if 
activated simultaneously  they can propel the balloon  forward , albeit a t a slow speed.  
However, any venting will  also cause the envelope to lose lift and descend.  
3.9.6.  In calm or very light wind conditions the ba sket normally stay s upright  during the  landing .  
However , in stronger winds the basket can tip over and possibly drag a long the ground.   If that 
happen s the pilot might  activate the rip line to collaps e the envelope  and stop any further 
dragging . 
3.9.7.  The last fatal ballooning accident in New Zealand was on 19 October 1995, when a Cameron 
A210 balloon was overtaken by a squall line and ditched into the sea near North New 
Brighton, Christchurch  (TAIC, 1995) .  Three passengers were drowned.   The Commission has 
since investigated 3 other balloon occurrences, all involving contact with power lines , none of 
which result ed in injuries .17  
3.9.8.  A review of ballooning accidents internationally s howed  that the majority of fatal and serious 
injury accidents involve d power lines.  A United States study reviewed the records of 495 hot -
air balloon crashes between 1964 and 1995 .  The crashes  resulte d in 92 fatalities  and 384 
serious injuries . A further  1057 individuals were either uninjured or received minor injuries  
(JAMA, 1998).  The study showed  that 27.7% of all crashes involved power lines and 
accounted for 44.6% of fatalities , and noted that “The odds of a fatality were more than 13 
times greater when contacting a power line than when hitting the ground”.  
3.9.9.  A later study in the United States looked at 86 balloon crashes between 2000 and 2004 , in 
which there were  5 fatalities  (ASEM, 2006) .  Power line strikes were involved in 34% of the 
crashes.  The study determined that the baskets suffered  “so little damage in accidents where

 Final report 12 -001 passengers are seriously injured  [that the]  strength of the balloon appears to need little 
improvement”.  
3.9.10.  A United Kingdom  study of ballooning accidents between January 1976 and January 2004 
found that the majority of accident s (83%) occurred during the approach and landing phase of 
flight ( Hasham , 2004).  Further, “power line collisions occurred in 34 accidents (35%) but 
adverse weather conditions accounted for only 8 of these”.  The study made reference to an 
article in The American Journal of Sports Medicine that stated that “collisions while the pilot is 
deflating the balloon have been associated with a significantly reduc ed risk of serious injury 
and death” (Marcus, 1981).  
3.10.  The regulator  
3.10.1.  On 10 November 2011 the initial issue of Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 Adventure Aviation – 
Certification and Operations came into effect to regulate  activities such as commercial 
ballooning  (CAA, 2011a)  (see section 6,  Safety actions .  However, transitional arrangements 
meant that balloon operat ors were not required to comply until 1 May 2012.  In the meantime 
balloon pilots were required to conform with Part 91 General Operating and Flight Rules (CAA, 
2011b) .  If conducting  commercial operations they had to comply with Part 61 , Pilot Licences 
and Ratings (CAA, 2011c).   
3.10.2.  Every pilot was required to operate their balloon in accordance with the operating limitations 
specified in the flight manu al or approved equivalent.  Pilots were  to ensure that safety 
briefing s were  given to passengers before each  flight.  Guidance on the content of the 
briefing s was given in the flight manual and focused on entry to the basket,  the landing 
position and the use of the holding ropes.  Passengers were not to hold on  to “hoses, valves or 
control lines”.  Civil Aviation Rule  Part 91  required pilot s to ensure that passengers were 
briefed on the procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency landing.   
3.10.3.  The AAIB and the BBAC were asked to comment on passenger briefing.  The BBAC provided a 
typical operations manual for a company flying large balloons , and extracts from the B BAC 
training manual used by most private balloon pilots  in the United Kingdom .  The con tent was 
similar to that referred to in the previous paragraph, including the direction that passengers 
were not to interfere with the controls.  One difference was that commercial balloon pilots 
were required to wear harness es.  Although “pilot incapacity  through illness” was mentioned in 
the BBAC list of briefing topics, it advised that this was never  actually discussed.  
Licen sing requirements  
3.10.4.  All commercial balloons are required to be registered  and have type certificate s issued .  They 
are required  to be maintained in accordance with their approved maintenance schedule s.  
Commercial balloon pilots are required to hold commercial pilot licence s (balloon)  and current 
class 1 medical certificate s and me et the currency requirement of 3 take -offs and landings in 
the preceding 90 days.  They also need to complete 2 -yearly flight test s.   
3.10.5.  In New Zealand, p ilots engaged in private or non -commercial flights are not required to hold 
licence s.  This lat ter group is therefore not subject to any form of competency or c urrency 
requirement s despite being potentially able to carry the same number of passengers as 
commercial operator s.  There is also no rating to cater for differences in balloon sizes and 
handling characteristics.    
3.10.6.  In contrast , balloon pilots in Australia  are required to hold student, private or commercial pilot 
licence s, and endorsement s depending on the size of the envelope and passenger capacity.  
In the United Kingdom pilots are required to hold either private or commercial pilot licence s.  
There is no  size or rating endorsement  for private pilots, but there is for commercial pilots .  In 
the United States pilots are also required to hold private or commercial pilot licence s, and also 
endorsement s depending on size of the balloon.

 Aviation -related concer ns 
3.10.7.  Aviation -related concern (ARC) is the term used by the CAA for a category of information 
regarding an aviation -related activity that may have implications for safety.  A concern can be 
raised by anyone and reported t o the CAA through its website, or by email or telephone.  For 
example , a person may allege or have  witnessed low flying, improper maintenance  or a near 
accident and is sufficiently concerned to let the CAA know.   
3.10.8.  ARCs are a safety net to catch information on activities that might  not be repo rted under Civil 
Aviation Rule Part 12 Accidents, Incidents, and Statistics .  At the time of the accident, o nce an 
ARC had been reported it was logged in the CAA’s management information system , given a 
reference number an d allocated to a CAA staff member for investigation .  Regardless of the 
potential severity of the ARC, each concern was to be investigated and either closed  off or 
referred to the most appropriate unit within the CAA for action.  For example , a low flying 
complaint could  be closed  off as u nproven or the incident referred to the enforcement unit for 
consideration of a  prosecution.   On 22 February 201 2 CAA staff drew the Commission’s 
attention to 2 ARCs  that they thought might be relevant to the Commission’s investigation .  
The 2 ARCs  are described below.  
3.10.9.  On 16 November 2009, an ARC had been  raised regarding “inadequate balloon testing”  of 
another balloon flown by the pilot and maintained by the maintainer of ZK -XXF.  The concern 
stated  that the annual inspection was not being correctl y carried out owing to a lack of proper 
equipment  and that b oth the pilot and the maintainer were aware of this.   Specifically, the 
maintenance action called for the completion of a porosity check using the manufacturer’s 
porosity tester.  It was alleged t hat the maintainer did not have access to or use the required 
piece of equipment.  
3.10.10.  The CAA records for this ARC noted  that the initial review identified  potential breaches of Civil 
Aviation Rules, including Part 43 General Maintenance Rule  and Part 91  Gener al Operating 
and Flight Rules .  On 30 September 2010 an entry was logged against the ARC stating that , 
given the serious nature of the allegation , a “coordinated approach/visit” was suggested.  The 
following entries referred to an unrelated ARC that had be en incorrectly entered into the file.  
The final entry , made on 11 November 2011, stated  “Assessed”  but there was no close -off 
action recorded nor was the originating ARC referred to another unit for follow -up action.  
3.10.11.  On 8 February 2010 a different  ARC concerning  the pilot had been  raised.  The ARC stated 
that a balloon passenger had been told that their  planned flight was cancelled because the 
pilot “appeared too ‘pissed and/or high ’18 to perform his piloting duties for that flight ”.  The 
ARC file record ed that by the following day  3 CAA staff members had been  assigned to look 
into the ARC.  
3.10.12.  The next file  entry on 25 August 2011 stated that the pilot and a crew member had been 
spoken to and both were “adamant that the incident never occurred” , and  that “co nsidering 
the level of accusations within the ballooning community against certain individuals it seems 
likely that this incident may not be genuine.  No further action required”.  The status of the 
ARC was  changed to “Assessed ” but there was no record of it being closed off . 
Review of ARC processes  
3.10.13.  In view of the 2 ARCs lodged concerning the pilot and the balloon maintenance  company, the 
Commission enquired into the CAA system for processing ARCs.  T he CAA advised th at there 
had been a longstanding internal concern about its  ARC management and process es.  In 
particular the CAA was concerned about the initial recording of ARCs, the allocation of 
appropriate resources and the ad -hoc manner in which they were managed to logical 
conclusion s.  In 2010 a review of ARCs was initiated and a report produced  titled “Aviation 
Related Concerns: Review of Processes and Procedures ”, dated 29 June 2010 .  The review 
found there was “a systemic failure in the CAA’s internal management systems”.  The 
                                                        
18 “Pissed” is understood to mean intoxicated or drunk.  “High” is understood to mean under the influence of 
drugs.    

<< Page 28 >>
 Final report 12 -001 treatment of ARCs varied and valuable information could  be missed. A lack of resources was 
also identified.  
3.10.14.  A follow -on discussion paper, titled  “The Processing of Aviation Related Concerns”  was 
produced on 22 June 2011 .  The discussion paper identified that organisational change was 
needed to address the issues raised in the earlier report as well as recommendations from  the 
Office of the Auditor -General on ARC processes.  The draft recommendations contained in the 
discussion paper were subsequently supersede d by the CAA’s Regulatory Operating Model , 
produced in late February 2012.  This in turn  resulted in a new executive management policy 
on ARCs titled “Responding to Aviation Related Concerns” being released on 6 March 2012.   
3.10.15.  The new ARC policy created a centralised management system for ARCs.  Information received 
by the CAA was to be directed to the Intelligence, Safety and Risk Analysis Unit for recording 
and the creati on of an ARC work request.  A dedicated position ha d since been established 
with that  person being  responsible for co -ordinating and managing all ARCs.  
3.10.16.  Following this accident, t he CAA initiated  an independent  review of the ARC process generally, 
and used  the 2 ARCs related to the pilot and  the balloon maintainer  as test cases.  T he final 
report was passed to the Commission  on 19 December 2012.  
3.10.17.  In summary, t he review found numerous systemic issues with the control and management of 
ARCs.  The investigation of ARCs was supplementary to staff members ’ normal work  and the 
number of ARCs received had continued to increas e steadily, from 347 in 2009 to 897 in 
2011.  There had been no compensating increase in resources to help manage  this increase  
and staff members allocated to ARC investigations were not given training on how to process 
an ARC to an effective conclusion.   
3.10.18.  The lack of resources and training had resulted in different standards of treatment of ARCs.  In 
regard to the 2 ARCs related to this accident, the review found that the ARCs could have or 
should have been more thoroughly investigated.   
3.10.19.  For the maintenance -related ARC, the review found that the lack of action between November 
2009 and June 2010 had resulted from “work pressures” but this had not been recorded.  
The opportunity to inform audit staff in preparation for their  next audit of the maintenance 
provider had not been exercised because of a breakdown in communication.  Further, the staff 
members concerned had not been aware of the linking function on the ARC computer 
management program that would have allowed them to view information about the 
maintenance provider and possibly adjust the scope of their audit accordingly . 
3.10.20.  The review identified that the second ARC relat ing to pilot performance  had initially been 
based on hearsay information and, according to a CAA staff member,  the ballooning 
community “was rife with rumour and personality issues”.  Follow -up enquiries had been  made 
with the Police but there had been  nothing of substance to validate the ARC.  The CAA  had 
found that  witnesses were reluctant to come forward  and make statement s so , following 
several informal interviews, and considering the quality of the information available, it had 
decided not to continue the investigation.  
3.10.21.  In conclusion the review noted that concerns previously identified had “been amply 
demonstrated with regard to the two ARCs considered”.   The underlying issues of co -
ordination, management, resource s and recordkeeping in respect of ARCs are being 
addressed, helped by the organisational changes made within the CAA, including additional 
staff.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  This balloon accident rates as the worst  single New Zealand aviation accident since the loss of 
a DC10 aeroplane on Mount Erebus, Antarctica in 1979.  As at January 2012, i t was also the 
second  worst single hot-air balloon accident  on record in the world .19 
4.1.2.  The flight started as a routine adventure flight .  The weather was suitable for the flight and the  
take-off and early stages of  the flight  appeared to run routinely .  Communications between the 
pilot and the ground crew w ere normal and no ne of the witnesses  noticed anything unusual 
until the  pilot yelled out shortly before the balloon  struck the power lines .   
4.1.3.  The Commission found several areas for concern regarding the maintenance of the balloon, 
but it found no defect with the balloon that could have contributed to the accident.  
4.1.4.  Although there was no obvious defect that contributed to the accident, the issue of balloon 
maintenance standards and the regulatory oversight of those standards was a safety issue.  
4.1.5.  The CAA’s sy stem for handling reported ARCs was reviewed.   Two ARCs had been  lodged with 
the CAA : one about the pilot an d one about the maintenance of the balloon ZK -XXF.  The 
Commission was unable to determine if the accident would have been prevented had  the CAA 
properly followed up these 2 ARCs.   Nevertheless, proper follow -up of ARCs is important, so 
this safety issue is discussed also.   
4.1.6.  The focus of the following discussion is on how the balloon came to be at low level above the 
silage paddock and what caused it t o strike the power line.  Pilot performance is central to 
that discussion.  
4.2. What happened  
Landing site  
4.2.1.  The pilot had told his ground crew that the landing would probably be in the Somerset Road 
area.  Th e predicted landing location  would  have been an estimate only .  In light wind 
conditions t he direction of the wind , and therefore the balloon’s track,  can vary significantly as 
a balloon descend s through the  levels .  This was the case on 7 January .  ZK-XXF approached 
the anticipated landing area initially in a south -east direction and then  began drifting  north -
east across Somerset Road before changing direction again to drift south -west over the silage 
paddock toward s Somerset Road .  The report by one of the witnesses on Somerset Road of 
“an isolated  gust of wind” from the north was consist ent with the flight path of the balloon 
changing to a more southerly direction towards the farm track and dual -voltage power lines.  
4.2.2.  After entering  the silage paddock the balloon descended to a few metres above the ground , 
which was just above the water spray  from the sprinkler system .  However, this paddock was 
unlikely to have been the pilot’s intended landing area .  There are  4 reasons  for this : 
1 The basket was not orientated for a landing  in the direction  in which  the balloon was 
travelling.  The landing side with the runners (support beams)  was nearly 180  degrees  out 
from the direction of flight  as it initially crossed the paddock  in a south -west direction .   
2 There  were several rows of sprinklers operating in the silage paddock and the pilot would 
have been unlikely to want either the passengers or the balloon to get wet.  
3 The passengers were not in their braced landing positions and were still leaning over the 
sides of the basket  as it crossed the silage paddock . 
                                                        
19 On 13 August 1989, 13 people were killed after their  balloon collided with another near Alice Springs, 
Australia.  On 26 February 2013, 19 people were killed when their balloon caught fire over Luxor, Egypt.  

<< Page 30 >>
 Final report 12 -001 4 The pilot had acknowledged the ground crew’s report of the horse in another  paddock 
over the road.  If the pilot had intended to land in the silage  paddock, th at would have 
been the time  to inform the ground crew.  
4.2.3.  The flight to this stage had take n nearly 45 minutes , and based on historical records there 
should have been ample fuel remaining to continue flying for another 45 minutes before low 
fuel quantity became  a concern .  There was also no rush to land at this time as there were 
suitable landin g paddocks immediately across Somerset R oad and farther on. 
4.2.4.  If the pilot did not intend to land in the silage paddock , there is the question of why he let the 
balloon descend to below the level of the dual -voltage power lines.  These power lines not only 
ran adjacent to the balloon’s initial path, but also ran across the Somerset Road border of the 
paddock.  The balloon always therefore needed to climb over them before crossing Somerset 
Road in search of a better landing site.  
4.2.5.  The pilot may have wanted to s tay at low level to land immediately after crossing Somerset 
Road.  However, allowing the balloon to descend below the level of the power lines was not 
safe practice.  There is a possibility that the pilot was giving the passengers  the experience of 
flying  at low level across the paddock, but again, to do so at such a low level would not have 
been  safe practice .  In any event, there was no evidence of any obvious concern or distress by 
the pilot, passengers or ground crew while the balloon was heading in a south -west direction 
across the silage paddock.  
4.2.6.  Until the balloon changed to a southerly direction there was probably ample time for the pilot 
to climb the balloon  over the power lines running along Somerset Road .  Once the direction 
changed more southerly towards the power lines running adjacent to the farm track, there was 
less distance and time for the balloon  to out-climb them.  It was at about this time that 
witnesses reported hearing the sustained operat ion of the burners .  The first indicatio n of 
anything untoward with the flight was when the pilot was heard telling  his passengers  to duck 
down .  When exactly the pilot stopped the burners could not be confirmed , but it was probably 
just before the basket came into contact with the first wire  and before the pilot ’s warning to 
his passenge rs, because w itnesses described hearing this warning clearly rather than over the 
roar of the burners.  
Did the pilot see the power line ? 
4.2.7.  Wires generally and power lines in particular are a well  known hazard for a ircraft operating at 
low level s.  Studies show they are also the single biggest cause of injury accidents involving  
balloons.   The safety material available for balloonists emphasises the danger of wires and is 
consistent in the message that wires must be avoided.  The flight manual for the Cameron 
A210 balloon devoted a section to contact with power lines.   The pilot should also  have been 
cautious of power lines , having been involved in  a wire strike some 12 years previously .  
4.2.8.  Wires can be difficult to detect, especially single and small -diameter wires.  The dulling of 
wires from exposure to the elements, certain lighting conditi ons and the presence of material 
such as lichen can act to camouflage wires.  Figure 7 shows example s of a power line  viewed  
from 2 different angles and demonstrates the potential difficulty in seeing wires.  The poles, 
however, remain clearly visible.

Power lines  
4.2.9.  Balloon p ilots should be aware of these factors and are taught to look for poles as an 
indication of the presence of wires.  Once a wire is sighted, the pilot should maintain a safe 
height above it or, if at very low level, start a climb early enough to clear the obstacle with a 
good safety margin.  
4.2.10.  The pilot of ZK -XXF was familiar with the local area with its numerous power lines and had 
flown over the power line he later struck  only 2 or 3 minutes earlier .  A photograph taken by a 
passenger at the time clearly showed the power lines below the basket.  The pilot had an 
unobstructed view ahead and, while he may have been facing away from the power line s when 
he operated the burners, he only had to turn slightly to see them . 
4.2.11.  The power line s, with their  6 wires and regularly spaced poles , should have been easily visible 
to the pilot as he crossed the silage paddock.   For this and other reason s given above, it is 
highly likely that the pilot kne w of and saw the power lines along the side and at the end of the 
silage paddock before allowing the balloon to descend below them.  


<< Page 32 >>
 Final report 12 -001 Post contact with the power lines 
4.2.12.  As the balloon rose from beneath the level of the power line s, the nearest wire caught ove r the 
corner lip of the basket at the pilot’s end.  A second wire then caught lower down the basket.  
The pilot had applied both burners to initiate a climb .  The balloon continued to rise and drift 
across the farm track, lifting the 2 wires and sliding al ong them towards Somerset  Road as it 
did so.  
4.2.13.  If contact with a power line is imminent , pilots are advised to initiate a rapid descent so that 
any contact is with the envelope instead of with  the basket.  This is the instruction given in the 
balloon flight manual , so as to  reduce  the height of the basket above the ground and less en 
the risk and severity of any injury.  The accident would have been  potentially survivable if an 
immediate descent had been initiated when the pilot first realised that the balloon  was likely 
to hit the power line s.  For some reason the pilot decided to try to out-climb the  power lines  
instead.  It is possible  that he thought there was sufficient time or distance to enable  the 
balloon to out-climb the power lines.   If so, this comes  down to a simple error in judgement.  
4.2.14.  Once the balloon was caught on the power lines the occupants were in extreme  danger.  A 
rapid deflation of the envelope at that point might still have risked an electric arc or shock to 
the occupants , but it would have  been the  more sensible option while ensuring  that no-one 
touched the power  lines or other metal objects.   Instead the occupants reportedly grabbed the 
power line and tried to push it off the basket.  This was always going to be difficult as the 
balloon wa s at that time still trying to climb.  The likelihood of serious or fatal injury was almost 
certain once the balloon caught fire, but once it broke free and rapidly climbed the chances of 
survival were negligible . 
4.2.15.  Another instruction given in the flight man ual is  to shut off the fuel bottles and lines, and vent 
the fuel lines  to reduce the risk of a fire.   It was not possible to  determin e whether the pilot 
had turned off the 2 cross -feed valves as part of his normal fuel managemen t or in response 
to the impending collision  with the power  lines .  However, flight manual advice was to operate 
with the cross -feed valves closed unless otherwise required.  The “as-found” condition would 
be consistent with this.  One of the LPG cylinders that would otherwise nor mally have been  
open had been shut off and the other had not.  It is possible that the pilot was in the process 
of shutting the system down but did not have time before the electrical arcing occurred .  As it 
turned out , his action probably would have  made little difference because the arcing ruptured 
one of the fuel cylinders , thereby  providing fuel to a source of ignition.  H eat from the ensuing 
fire caused  the pressure relief valves on the other bottles to burst , adding more fuel to the fire.  
4.2.16.  The intense fire that develop ed below  the mouth of the envelope would have heated the air 
inside it and increased the tendency for the balloon to climb.  The 2 passengers jump ing from 
the basket would have lightened the load and also caused a greater  tendency for the balloon 
to climb.  However, this was not considered a significant  factor in comparison with the 
sustained use of the burners and the effect of the fire.  The speed of the balloon ’s ascent 
once it broke free of the power lines was significa ntly higher  than would have been expected 
had the load lightened by 2 passengers  alone .  The wires were calculated to have 4 m of free 
vertical movement before coming under strain.  The ultimate tensile strength of the wires was 
36.5 kilo newtons . The fact that the balloon lifted 2 heavy wires and one wire parted  confirm s 
that the balloon was generating a large amount of lift as it pull ed the wires upward.   The action 
of the 2 passengers in jumping from the basket was understandable in the circumstances and 
did not alter the outcome of the accident.  
4.2.17.  Once the balloon broke free of the power line , it continued to rise and drift west  across the 
road.  The fire spread to the envelope , which ultimately lost its ability to support the weight of 
the balloon.  The en velope  collapsed and separated  from the basket  shortly before it hit the 
ground . 
  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 33 >>
 Findings  
1. The weather conditions were suitable for the balloon flight that morning.  
2. The pilot allowed the balloon to descend below the level of power lines 
surrounding a paddock in which  he did not intend to land.   It could not be 
determined whether that action was deliberate or not, but it unnecessarily 
compromised the safety of the flig ht. 
3. It was highly  likely that the pilot knew the location of the power lines and had 
seen  them before allowing the balloon to descend below their height.  
4. A last -minute change in wind direction carried the balloon towards power lines 
that the loaded balloon  was probably not capable of out -climbing.  In any event, 
the pilot exercised poor  judgement  by attempt ing to out -climb the power line s, 
and the balloon  collided with them.  
5. Electrical arcing from the power lines punctured one of the balloon’s LPG fuel 
cylinders, causing an intense fuel -fed fire that consumed the basket and 
increased the air temperature in the balloon envelope.  
6. The pilot’s initial application of the burners  caused the balloon to climb.  Heat 
from the basket fire and to a lesser extent 2 of t he balloon passengers jumping 
from the basket increased  the balloon ’s lift  and caused  it to break the power line  
that was restraining it.  It then  ascend ed rapidly and f ell to the ground once the 
envelope caught fire.  
7. Once a collision with power lines is imminent, the recommended action is for the 
pilot to descend the balloon  rapidly .  Had he done so there would have been a 
better chance of survival for the balloon ’s occupants . 
4.3. Performance of the pilot  
General  
4.3.1.  The pilot had accumulated more than  1000 hours  of ballooning and had flown commercial 
balloon flights from his base in Carterton for nearly 15 years.  He had also landed near the 
accident site, possibly even in the same silage paddock, several times before.  He was 
therefore experienced and famil iar with the local area.   
4.3.2.  The pilot’s medical certificate had lapsed 6 weeks before the accident.  He subsequently flew 
9 flights, not including the accident flight, with an expired medical certificate.  CAA Rules 
require d pilots to maintain current medic al certificate s as part of their licence s (CAA, 2011) .  
He had previously been made aware that his certificate was about to expire but there was no 
evidence found to show that the pilot was in the process of renewing it.  Undertak ing the flight 
knowing tha t he did not have a current  Class 1  medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation 
Rules displayed a certain disregard for the authority of those Rules. 
4.3.3.  The pilot was , however , considered to be healthy and not suffering from any ailment that 
would have prevented him flying.  The medical examiner was aware that the pilot suffered 
from  gout and he believed this would not have precluded him from issuing a class 1 medical 
certificate . 
Cannabis  
4.3.4.  Pilots, like other persons  in safety -critical roles in aviation and other transport modes, need to 
be able to discharge their duties free of performance -impairing substances , such as those 
contained in drugs and alcohol.  Cannabis is a known per formance -impair ing substance.  The 
Commission obtained the test results for blood samples taken from the balloon pilot.  The 

<< Page 34 >>
 Final report 12 -001 samples were not optimal. They were taken 3.5 days after the time of death and included a 
mixture of other body fluids.  The sample s obtained could not  therefore be considered as 
“whole blood ”.  They were , however , good enough to analyse for performance -impairing 
substances such as cannabis, provided the appropriate caveats were  considered.  
4.3.5.  The pilot’s urine was also tested for the p resence of cotinine, a substance found in the urine 
of tobacco smokers.  This test was negative, showing that it was highly unlikely the pilot had 
smoked regular tobacco on the morning of the flight.  The pilot also was not known by his 
friends and colleagues to smoke regular tobacco.  
4.3.6.  The active ingredient of cannabis is THC.  The sample analysed revealed a THC level of 2 
micrograms per litre of blood  (fluid obtained).  This was well above that normally considered 
possible for passive ingestion (inad vertent ingestion by being in the same room as others who 
are smoking cannabis , for example [Mason, 1983 and Morland , 1985]).20  This indicates that 
the pilot had deliberately consumed the drug at some point prior to the accident.   
4.3.7.  Three experts in forensi c toxicology gave their opinions on the pilot’s post -mortem toxicology 
results.  ESR and Dr Robertson  gave their opinions based on the pilot being an occasional 
user of cannabis, and the Police expert based his opinion on the assumption that the pilot was 
a “chronic” user of cannabis , which was an assumption he made from the information he was 
given, that the pilot was a “long -term regular” user of cannabis.  It is not clear whether the 
terms “chronic user” and “long -term regular user” mean the same thing.  In fact, it is a 
subjective assessment  as to how much cannabis a person needs to consume , and how often , 
for the label of “chronic user ” to apply .  
4.3.8.  Under “normal smoking conditions ”, a blood THC level of 2 micrograms per litre 70 -80 
minutes after use would be possible, based on an infrequent user smoking one or part of one 
cannabis cigarette.21  On this basis, the level shown in the tests was consistent with the pilot 
smoking the equi valent of one cannabis cigarette up to 4 -6 hours before the accident.  
4.3.9.  The Police expert said that if the pilot was a regular “chronic” user of cannabis, such a level of 
THC in the blood could  be reached due to the post-mortem redistribution of THC from bod y 
fatty tissue.  He said  that in that case it would be possible that the pilot had not ingested 
cannabis on the morning of the flight.  
4.3.10.  On reviewing the medical opinions the Commission accepts the premise that the more often a 
person smokes cannabis , the hi gher the likelihood of post -mortem THC readings being 
attributed to post -mortem redistribution.  That is because the more a person  smoke s cannabis 
greater will be the accumulat ion of THC  in the body fatty tissue before it can be eliminated 
from the body th rough natural process es.  Therefore, if the pilot was a frequent user of 
cannabis, it would be possible that such a level would  have  remain ed from previous use. 
Conversely, if the pilot was an infrequent user of cannabis, such a level would indicate more 
recent use.22  The test results could therefore be the result of both longer -term and recent 
use. 
4.3.11.  The pilot’s friend reported that he had not observe d the pilot smoking cannabis the night 
before the accident, nor was the pilot observed by his partner smoking  cannabis at home the 
previous evening or before  he left home on the morning of the flight.  That is not to say that he 
could not have done so at some time on his own, but both his friend and his partner said that 
he had not displayed any signs of having s moked cannabis the evening before the flight.  
4.3.12.  The 2 ground crew  and the photographer, all of whom had worked with the pilot for many 
years, did not see the pilot smoking on the morning of the flight.  Each agreed that there were 
                                                        
20 The research papers suggest that to start showing a positive result for THC the pilot would have n eeded to  
be in a small, unventilated room or motor vehicle on the morning of the accident with several people who 
were smoking cannabis.  
21 The 70 - to 80 -minute timeframe is the time from when the pilot was observed smoking on the balcony to 
the time of d eath.  
22 Police expert’s opinion, Appendix 3.  ESR and Dr Robertson’s opinions Appendix 4.  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 35 >>
 occasions during the morning when  they were not with the pilot.  It is possible therefore that 
the pilot smoked cannabis at some time that morning, unseen by them.  
4.3.13.  One of the ground crew and the photographer were nevertheless adamant that the pilot did 
not smoke before  the flight.  They believed this because they did not notice him being under 
the influence of cannabis and did not notice the distinctive smell of cannabis on the pilot.  The 
3 were aware that the pilot socialised with a group that regularly u sed cannabis.  One of the 3 
had seen the pilot use cannabis in his presence, and another suspected he had used 
cannabis before.  However, all 3 said it would have been out of character for the pilot to 
smoke cannabis before a flight, especially in view of the passengers and other people 
assembled that morning.  
4.3.14.  The pilot was not averse to flouting rules.  He had continued to operate his commercial 
balloon venture despite  his medical certificate having expired some 6 weeks previously.  There 
are 2 other consi derations that could also have altered his normal behaviour:  
 the pilot was about to lose a significant portion of his income with the return of the 
balloon to its owner.  While he reportedly accepted this, it was the first topic he raised 
with the 2 ground  crew and the photographer on the morning of the flight, and he was 
not happy about it  
 the pilot was known to suffer from gout, and was seen to be limping that morning.  Gout 
was a  condition that may have affected his behaviour.  
4.3.15.  The 2 witnesses who saw th e pilot smoking on the balcony of the shed shortly before the flight 
made their reports only after they became aware  that the pilot had tested positive for THC.  
One of them was made aware of the results at a Police briefing before the public release of 
the Commission’s interim report on the accident.  She reported what she had seen to the 
Police immediately after the briefing.  
4.3.4  The 2 witnesses did not know what the pilot was smoking and both assumed he was smoking 
a regular cigarette.  After  making their re ports, the 2 witnesses were interviewed separately, 
initially by the Police, then by the Commission.  
4.3.16.  The 2 witnesses were standing about 25 m from the pilot and had a clear view of him on the 
balcony.  Their observations  were consistent.  They saw the pilo t taking something to his 
mouth and smoke then rising from it.  They did not see the pilot drinking from the cup he held.  
Tests made of the pilot’s urine were negative for the substance of cotinine, which means that 
if the pilot was smoking, he was not sm oking regular tobacco.  
4.3.17.  It has not been possible  to determine with any certainty how often the pilot used cannabis.  It 
is possible that he used it more than “occasionally” as described by those 2 witnesses who 
were close to him – the partner and  the friend.  Neither could be emphatic on that point 
because neither was with the pilot all of the time.  Similarly for the 2 ground crew and 
photographer, as none of the 3 was with the pilot all of the time.  
4.3.18.  On the balance of probabilities the THC level of 2 micrograms per litre of blood resulted from 
both longer -term and recent use.  On reviewing the evidence available, it was highly likely that 
the pilot smoked cannabis on the morning of the flight.  The pilot was only on the balcony for a 
limited time, so it was possible that he smoked part of a cigarette only.  These c onclusions are 
supported by the following 3 points:  
 2 witnesses observed the pilot smoking on the balcony shortly before the flight  
 the pilot was not known to smoke regular cigarettes and his urine tested negative for 
cotinine, which is normally found in t he urine of someone who has smoked regular 
tobacco  
 the pilot was known to use cannabis, including in the company of others.  
4.3.19.  It has been suggested that subtle cognitive impairment could develop in chronic users over 
several years. Solowij  et al examined cog nitive functioning in a group of 9 long-term cannabis 

<< Page 36 >>
 Final report 12 -001 users (Solowij, 2008). Their findings suggested that long -term cannabis use may impair the 
efficient processing of information.  
4.3.20.  Given that it was highly likely that it was cannabis the 2 witnesses saw t he pilot smoking, it 
was only about 25 minutes before commencing the flight and about one hour and 35 minutes 
to the time he was landing  the balloon in the Somerset Road area.  These times are well within 
the 1.5 -4 hours that the subjective symptoms of can nabis intoxication are known to last.  
4.3.21.  The opinion of the Commission’s expert was that cognitive impairment at or around the time of 
the accident, and its contribution to the cause of accident, could not  be excluded.  ESR noted 
that symptoms of cannabis int oxication usually peak 10 -15 minutes after smoking cannabis 
and last 1.5 -4 hours.  The degree of cognitive impairment cannot be determined as the effects 
vary from person to person.  Nevertheless, cognitive impairment of the pilot could not  be 
excluded giv en the carry -over effect of cannabis from both recent and longer -term use.  The 
extent to which longer -term use could cause cognitive impairment would depend on the 
frequency of use.  
4.3.22.  Studies have shown that the greater the judgement and skills required in  performing a task, 
the greater would be the impairment.  Flying low level across the paddock; replying to a radio 
call; preparing to land in variable wind conditions; and dealing with a sudden change in flight 
path would have all combined to put the pilot  under some pressure to make quick and correct  
decisions.  
4.3.23.  The sections above refer to a number of errors in judgement by the pilot , namely:  
 allowing the balloon to descend over the silage paddock and continue at a height below the 
level of the power lines  – rather than maintain a safe height  
 his reaction to the last -minute change of direction towards the adjacent power lines , in not 
descending and landing  
 his response once the balloon had collided with the power lines , in not initiating an 
emergency descent.  
4.3.24.  Cognitive impairment  could typically contribute to these types of error.  Although it cannot be 
concluded definitively that the cause of the accident was the pilot smoking cannabis, the 
possibility that it did contribu te to the accident could not be excluded.  
4.3.25.  Pilots, others involved in the aviation industry and the public all need to be aware of the 
dangers associated with the use of performance -impairing substances.  The same principle 
applies to all transport modes an d activities involving complex tasks requiring attention and 
mental co -ordination.  
ARCs relating to the pilot   
4.3.26.  The CAA had longstanding concerns about the handling of ARCs, and had undertaken several 
reviews in the previous  3 years.  The latest independent  review of ARCs highlighted a number 
of systemic issues.  The CAA accepted the findings of the review and has initiated changes in 
the management of ARCs.  The ARC lodged in February 2010 claiming this balloon pilot had 
been  unfit to conduct a flight was e xamined in depth by the review’s author, who found that 
follow -up enquiries made by CAA staff had been  appropriate for the information received.  
4.3.27.  It was not possible to say whether a more rigorous follow -up of the concern by the CAA would 
have prevented the 7 January 2012 accident.  What the case emphasises, h owever, is the 
importance of the CAA responding to ARCs as quickly, completely and robustly as possible.  
ARCs provide valuable information about risk, and the CAA needs to e nsure that this 
information is acted upon, focusing particularly on those commercial operations that may put 
the lives of members of the public at risk .  While the CAA -initiated independent review 
concluded that the CAA had acted appropriately, this case s erves as a strong reminder that 
this must be an area of ongoing focus for the CAA.  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 37 >>
 4.3.28.  Had the CAA undertaken a more prompt and co -ordinated response to the February 2010 ARC 
it could have identified a potential safety risk and a range of preventive actions.   
Other accidents where performance -impairing substances were  involved  
4.3.29.  As noted in paragraph 3. 6.4, the Commission has investigated 6 occur rences in the past 10 
years, including in the rail and marine modes, where crew members were found to have taken 
performance -impairing  substances in the hours or days leading up to the accident s.  The 
aviation accidents included another Part 119 adventure activity (TAIC, 2010), and a 
commercial air transport flight (TAIC, 2005).  While substance impairment could not be 
identified as a primary cause in these accidents, the use of these substances by personnel 
responsible for performing safety -critical tasks is a transport -wide safety issue.  
4.3.30.  On 8 March 2011, in its report on a collision between a jet boat and a jetski, (TAIC, 2009), the 
Commission made a recommendation to the Secretary for Transport regarding substance 
impairment in the maritime sector.  The recommendation referenced persons in charge of any 
craft, but the same could apply to a person who has responsibil ities or duties to do with safety -
critical activities within the rail and aviation industries .  The recommendation and the reply on 
behalf of the Secretary for Transport  are shown below:  
Until legislation is made setting limits for and testing of alcohol a nd other 
performance impairing substances for recreational and commercial boat drivers, 
the risk of alcohol -related accidents will be elevated.  
It is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address  this safety issue by 
promoting appropriate legislatio n to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and 
other performance impairing substances for persons in charge of recreational 
and commercial craft, and supporting legislation to allow testing for such levels in 
these cases. (005/11)  
4.3.31.  On 16 March 2011 the Ma nager Maritime and Freight of  the Ministry of Transport replied to 
the recommendation:  
The recommendation is that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to 
set limits and establish a testing regime to address the risk of recreational and 
commercia l boating accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance -
impairing substances.  
Recreational and commercial boating is one of three areas of transport activity 
where no alcohol and drug limits or testing regime yet exists.  The introduction of 
such a regime in any of these areas would be a major policy decision for 
government that would need to be informed by a thorough understanding of the 
problem and the policy options.  The Ministry therefore intends to develop a 
report to government on the feas ibility of a compulsory post -accident and 
incident drug and alcohol testing regime for the aviation, maritime and rail 
transport sectors.  
Accordingly, implementation of recommendation 005/11 would only be 
practicable once the relevant policy work has been undertaken by the Ministry, 
and then only if the results indicated that a drug and alcohol testing regime is a 
feasible option.  
4.3.32.  The Commission notes that this proposed action fell short of what the Commission  
recommended, namely, that legislation should set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and 
other performance -impairing substances.  Post -accident and -incident testing on its own will 
not act as a sufficient deterrent unless it can be backed up with potential enforcement 
measures.   The Commission belie ves there should be a zero tolerance to impairment by drugs 
and alcohol in the transport sector, and random or targeted testing should be included in the 
range of measures to promote safer work practices.  
4.3.33.  On 22 March 2012 , in its report on a loss of control and crash involving a skydiving plane at 
Fox Glacier a erodrome (TAIC , 10-010), the Commission made a nother  recommendation to the 
Secretary for Transport  as follows:  

<< Page 38 >>
 Final report 12 -001 The use of performance impairing substances is known to have a detrimental 
effect on the ability of people to safely operate in critical transport 
environments.   The Commission recommends that the Secretary for Transport 
promotes the introduction of a drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regime 
for persons employed in safety  critical transport roles (011/12).  
4.3.34.  On 3 May 2012 the General Manager Aviation and Maritime of the Ministry of Transport 
replied, in part:  
I accept the specific recommendation 011/12 directed to the Secretary for 
Transport.  
I also urge the Commission to note the existing health and safety in employment 
regulatory regime, where drugs and alcohol are specifically mentioned in the 
definition of “hazard”. This regime already places obligations on both employers 
and employees.  
Since the Fox Glacier accident th e Minister of Transport has approved a new Rule 
Part 115 that entered into force in November 2011.   The Rule requires 
adventure aviation operations to be certified by 1 May 2012.   Adventure aviation 
organisations, including commercial parachuting, now face  the risk that their 
safety certification can be suspended and removed for safety violations. This 
gives such operators a stronger incentive to ensure they address alcohol and 
drug taking safety risks in their organisations.  
Over the next two years the Gov ernment will be considering rule amendments 
that would require aviation organisations to introduce safety management 
systems.   This would require certificated operators to assess and mitigate all 
safety risks relevant to their operation.   This risk of into xication of personnel by 
drugs and alcohol would clearly be a safety risk that we would expect both 
operators and the Civil Aviation Authority (when certifying and auditing aviation 
organisations) to be actively addressing under an SMS regime.   Decisions w ill 
also be made in the near future to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority is 
resourced to transition to the ICAO -endorsed SMS approach which has 
widespread industry support.  
Whilst recognising that where the illegal use of drugs is involved, changing  
individual behaviour will be challenging, the Ministry will encourage the Civil 
Aviation Authority to step up its effort to alert the aviation community through 
education of the risks that drugs pose to the safety operation of aviation 
undertakings.   This will require an on -going effort.  
As you are aware, the Ministry has developed a Transport Regulatory Policy 
Statement that specific rule changes may not always be the best interventions to 
achieve desire d safety outcomes.   Non-regulatory interventions ca n often be 
more appropriate.   In this regard we appreciate the Commission’s 
recommendation to promote a drug and alcohol detection and deterrence 
regime, rather than to implement a regime.  
The Ministry of Transport has in the past sponsored an inter -agency  Substance 
Impairment Group.   This looked at whether or not compulsory random drug and 
alcohol testing, and specific breath alcohol limits, should be required by 
regulation in the aviation, marine and rail transport modes.   In part because of a 
lack of dat a, we were not convinced at that time that the costs would outweigh 
the benefits.   We will, however, monitor international experience in this regard 
and, in particular, the recent relevant changes in the Australian aviation regime.  
4.3.35.  The Commission notes with concern the p ossibility  that performa nce-impairing substances 
(cannabi s) contributed to this accident  – one of New Zealand’s worst aviation disasters.  While 
acknowledging the benefit s of some of the steps outlined above in response to previous 
recommend ations, the Commission firmly believes that the risk of performance -impairing 
substances contributing to future transport accidents and incidents will remain unacceptably 
high until legislation is introduced to deal properly with this safety issue.   
 
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 39 >>
 Findings   
8. The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation 
Rules.  This was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way , but  it did 
show a disregard for complying with the rules.  
9. The pilot had a  post-mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre .  This was 
likely the result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis  shortly  before the flight  
(considered highly likely) , and residual THC from hi s having ingested  cannabis 
over a longer  term that redistributed into his blood after he died .  It was not 
possible to determine if either  factor contributed more  or less to the  toxicology 
result . 
10. The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot .  The possibility that 
the pilot’s performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis  cannot be 
excluded.  
11. The l ong-term and recent ingestion of performance -impairing substances such as 
cannabis  by crew of any transport vehicle is a serious safety issue that needs to 
be addressed as a matter of priority.  
4.4. Balloon  maintenance  and performance  
4.4.1.  Ballooning in New Zealand is a small -scale activity , with 74 balloons recorded on the CAA 
aircraft register, i ncluding numerous small 2 - and 4 -person balloons, and some that have not 
flown for extended periods of time.   As a re sult ballooning has attracted less attention from 
the CAA, which had little in-house  expertise in the maintenance of balloons  at the time of the 
accident .  The CAA had therefore delegated the responsibility for the initial inspection for the 
certificate of airworthiness to more experienced maintenance engineers.  This was the case 
with the accident balloon  ZK-XXF and its predecessor ZK -EMB.  
4.4.2.  The delegation of balloon inspections still meant that the CAA retained the  responsibility for 
ensuring that the documentation submitted for approval and the issuing of certificates was 
correct.   The documents submitted by the maintenance provider for the accident balloon 
contained er rors that had not been identified  by the CAA.  Similar certification errors were 
found with some other balloons  as well . 
4.4.3.  Balloons are obviously different from  other  aircraft  types;  nevertheless , they still need to be 
rigorously maintained .  The Commission found no evidence of any mechanical or envelope 
defect  that contributed to the accident.  The flight proceeded normally.  The pilot reported no 
issues.  The burners were seen and heard to be operating and the balloon was seen to begin 
climbin g just before and after contact with the wires.  In spite of the fire and impact damage, 
the balloon was found to be in good working order.  
4.4.4.  However, the maintenance performed on ZK -XXF, namely the documentation,  was 
substandard .  T he Commission was concern ed that this could  have extended to other 
balloons , so it  published an urgent recommendation to the Director of Civil Aviation  to address 
this safety issue. (Refer to section 7 , Recommendations , and section 6, Safety actions ). 
4.4.5.  The ARC on the practices of t he balloon maintainer, had it been followed through properly by 
the CAA, should have identified the need for the CAA to improve its oversight of that part of the 
balloon industry much sooner than when this accident occurred.  However, as stated earlier, 
nothing in the maintenance procedures for this balloon contributed to the accident.  The 
safety actions taken by the CAA in its handling of ARCs has addressed that safety issue.  
4.5. Balloon safety  
4.5.1.  The Commission examined the design and construction of balloons, and the emergency 
equipment and procedures , and tested those factors against the survivability of this accident.  

<< Page 40 >>
 Final report 12 -001 4.5.2.  Balloon envelope material has improved with the introduction of increasingly stronger , tear -
resistant fabrics .  Envelopes can last longer, sust ain greater heat damage and better endure  
the effects of the sun and moisture  than previously .  There are required tests to monitor the 
condition and performance of the balloon envelope.   
4.5.3.  The basket , meanwhile , has change d little, with c ane and wicker cont inuing to be the princip al 
materials used in construction.  These materials are lightweight and provide both strength and 
flexibility.  They are able to absorb the repeated knocks o f a landing and sliding along the 
ground and often tipping over.  The drawb ack is that cane, which is normally  varnished, has 
limited  fire-resistant qualities.  Fire-resistant materials are usually a stipulation for enclosed 
commercial transport vehicles where opportunit ies for passenger escape can be limited.  The 
concept is to try to limit the spread of fire long enough to enable opportunities for both fire -
fighting and escape.  
4.5.4.  In this case the electrical arcing and the ensuing LPG -fed fire were intense.  There are not 
many  materials available that would be resistant to fires of that intensity and still be suitable 
for balloon baskets.  In these situations the primary defence against this type of fire is first 
avoiding the electrical arcing, and second starv ing the fire of f uel.  LPG is highly flammable 
and the design of the fuel system was so that the entire system could be closed off.  This 
situation where one of the LPG bottles was punctured by the electrical arcing was unusual .  
The ensuing fire would have been almost unc ontainable, even if the basket had been 
constructed from fire -retardant material.  
4.5.5.  The balloon  was required to be fitted with a fire extinguisher and one was found in the 
wreckage with the safety pin still in place, which indicated it had not been used.  P hotographs 
taken on the morning of the accident show that it had been  stowed centrally in the pilot’s 
compartment next to the passenger compartments.  Passengers might  have been able to 
reach  the extinguisher, but would have firstly needed to know it was th ere and then  needed to 
lean over the basket partition to reach it . 
4.5.6.  The initial location and intensity of the fire may have prevented the occupants reaching  the 
extinguisher.  Regardless, the New Zealand Fire Service investigator who assisted the 
Commission  considered that the extinguisher would have had little or no effect in containing 
the very hot fuel -fed fire.   These types of extinguisher were  designed to extinguish or contain 
smaller fires.  In different circumstances, having the basket constructed fro m fire -retardant 
material could have slowed the spread of a small fire and increase d the chance of the balloon 
occupants extinguishing it.  Manufacturers of balloon baskets should consider this when 
designing future baskets.  
4.5.7.  The pilot g ave 2 briefings to t he passengers before the flight.  The first was a general welcome 
with a  description of the balloon , the preparation for the flight and how to enter and exit the 
basket .  The second briefing was a safety briefing , which normally included practi sing the 
landing position  and where to place the hands , and instructions to not attempt to vacate the 
basket until instructed by the pilot. According to experienced ballooning pilots in New Zealand 
and overseas, a balloon pilot would not normally brief passengers o n the emergency 
equipment available or how to operate the control lines.   It would be common, especially in 
single -compartment baskets, to instruct passengers not to interfere with the control lines , as 
the incorrect use of the controls could be fatal.  
4.5.8.  There is an argument that had the pilot become incapacitated by the initial electrical arcing , a 
passenger could have descended the balloon using the emergency deflation cord had they 
been instructed in its use.  This would need to be balanced with the risk o f a passenger 
panicking and pulling the cord at an inappropriate time . 
4.5.9.  The Commission could identify no obvious improvements in the design and operation of 
balloons in general that might have improved the chances of surviva l of the balloon occupants 
in thi s accident.  
4.5.10.  The emergency services received multiple notifications of the accident and responded 
promptly, reac hing the accident site within 6 minutes .  This was a good response.  A faster  
response would not have improved the survivability of this accident.  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 41 >>
 4.5.11.  There is no requirement to hold a licence for private ballooning in New Zealand.  This was not 
a factor in this accident because the pilot was experienced and held a commercial balloon 
licence.  However, the absence of a private balloon licence, with its associated requirements 
for theoretical and practical examinations and medical standards, is at variance with 
International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines and those of other countries with similarly 
developed histor ies of ballooning.  Fort unately new balloon pilots usually seek guidance and 
training from experienced pilots and operate within an association of balloonists that provide s 
some supervision.  The Director of Civil Aviation has issue d an NPRM  seeking to introduce a 
mandatory priva te balloon licence and a balloon instructor rating, which should  address this 
safety issue  (see section 6 for details) . 
4.5.12.  Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 Adventure Aviation – Certification and Operations came into effect 
on 10 November 2011, about 2 months befo re this accident.  Transitional arrangements 
meant that balloon operators were not required to comply until May 2012, about 4 months 
after the accident.  The Commission has concluded that , for the reason s given in this section , 
the regulatory oversight of the ballooning industry was not sufficient for its size and the 
potential risk to the public, for both private and commercial balloon operations.  The 
introduction of Rule Part 115 should provide a good mechanism for balloon operators to 
improve the safety  of operations, and for the CAA to maintain appropriate oversight of the 
industry.  
Findings   
12. The r egulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not 
sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public.  
13. It is a safety issue that a person without any prescribed training, knowledge or 
medical certificate can take non -paying passengers for a balloon flight.   
14. The basic design and safety of the balloon were  adequate and improvements in 
the design would not have alt ered the outcome of this accident.  
 
  

<< Page 42 >>
 Final report 12 -001 5. Findings  
5.1. The weather conditions were suitable for the balloon flight that morning.  
5.2. The pilot allowed the balloon to descend below the level of power lines surrounding a paddock 
in which  he did not intend to land.  It could not be determined whether that action was 
deliberate or not, but it unnecessarily compromised the safety of the flight.  
5.3. It was highly  likely that the pilot knew the location of the power lines and had seen  them 
before allowing the balloon to descend below their height.    
5.4. A last -minute change in wind direction carried the balloon towards power lines that the loaded 
balloon was probably not capable of out -climbing.  In any event, t he pilot exercised poor 
judgement  by attempt ing to out -climb the power li nes, and the balloon collided with them.  
5.5. Electrical arcing from the power lines punctured one of the balloon’s LPG fuel cylinders, 
causing an intense fuel -fed fire that consumed the basket and increased the air temperature 
in the balloon envelope.  
5.6. The pilot’s initial application of the burners  caused the balloon to climb.   Heat from the basket 
fire and to a lesser extent 2 of the balloon passengers jumping from the basket increased the 
balloon ’s lift and caused it to break the power line that was restra ining it.  I t then  ascend ed 
rapidly and f ell to the ground once the envelope caught fire.  
5.7. Once a collision with power lines is imminent, the recommended action is for the pilot to 
descend the balloon  rapidly .  Had he done so there would have been a better chance of 
survival for the balloon ’s occupants.  
5.8. The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules.  This 
was unlikely to have contributed to this accident in any way , but  it did show a disregard for 
complying with the  rules.  
5.9. The pilot had a post -mortem THC blood level of 2 micrograms per litre.  This was likely the 
result of 2 factors: the pilot smoking cannabis shortly  before the flight  (considered highly 
likely) , and residual THC from his having ingested  cannabis ove r a longer  term that 
redistributed into his blood after he died.  It was not possible to determine if either factor 
contributed more or less to the toxicology result.  
5.10.  The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot .  The possibility that the pilot’s 
performance was impaired as a result of  ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded.  
5.11.  The l ong-term and recent ingestion of performance -impairing substances such as cannabis by 
crew of any transport vehicle is a serious safety issue that needs to be addressed as a matter 
of priority.  
5.12.  The r egulatory oversight of commercial ballooning in New Zealand was not sufficient to ensure 
a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public.  
5.13.  It is a safety issue that a person without a ny prescribed training, knowledge or medical 
certificate can take non -paying passengers for a balloon flight.   
5.14.  The basic design and safety of the balloon were  adequate and improvements in the design 
would not have altered the outcome of this accident.  
  
Final report 12 -001

 6. Safety a ctions  
6.1. General  
6.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
a. safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that resulted in an urgent safety recommendation 
or would otherwise have result ed in the Commission issuing a recommendation  
b. safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
6.1.2.  Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Maintenance  
6.2.1.  As a result of the urgent safety recommendation described in section 7, on 21 February 2012 
a safety inspection team from the CAA commenced an inspection of the 5 maint enance 
providers approved to work on balloons, star ting with the maintainer for ZK -XXF.  The 
inspection team found that while most balloon maintenance providers were adhering to good 
maintenance pract ices and generated no concerns, there were “various levels of performance 
in respect of adherence to the manufacturer’s maintenance manual and [Civil Aviation 
Rules]” . The CAA report said that one maintenance provider in particular had not appeared to 
meet  the required standards.  The reasons cited included:  
a. a lack of direct supervision of maintenance being performed by unapproved repair and 
test agencies prior to certification of that maintenance in the maintenance records  
b. an incorrect application of  the “grab test”.  This was mitigated in part by the provider’s 
knowledge and experience  
c. incorrect records stating that a porosity check had been completed  
d. the incorrect technique used for the fuel system inspection.  
 The CAA report made 2 recommenda tions in respect of the above maintenance provider: 
firstly, “that a further in depth inspection/audit is conducted”; and secondly, that 
“consideration be given to whether re -inspection is required to validate the aspects of 
maintenance that have not been conducted in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
maintenance manual”.  
6.2.2.  As a result of the inspection, the Inspection Authorisation document for the princip al of the 
maintenance provider was suspended until the completion of a “ section 15a investigation ”.  
This referred to section 15a of the Civil Aviation Act 1990 and the “Power of the Director to 
investigate holder of aviation document… if the Director believes, on reasonable grounds, that 
it is necessary in the interests of civil aviation safety and securi ty”.  
6.2.3.  On 6 March 2012 , at the request of the Director of Civil Aviation, an investigation team was 
formed to gather information regarding the exercise of the privileges of the personal aviation 
documents held and the maintenance practices carried out by th e maintainer.  The team 
found that:  
While most of the issues identified during the investigation were not seen as 
individual  safety risks, the number and variety of issues is concerning.  
Common themes are a lack of discipline in completing records, a lack of checking  
of records prior to signing the release to service and a lack of checking the 
resulting  loose leaf entry records.  

<< Page 44 >>
 Final report 12 -001  At about this time the Inspection Authorisation for the maintenance provider’s princip al 
expired and was not renewed.  As a resul t the CAA required the maintenance provider to put in 
place a number of changes and quality management initiatives.  
6.2.4.  On 27 June 2012 a safety audit of the maintenance provider was undertaken .  The audit team 
identified 2 minor and 2 major findings.  The maj or findings related to an expired part and 
fluid, and missing documentation for another part, all held in the bond store.  Other than 
recommending a “thorough audit” of the bond store items, no additional action was 
recommended.  
6.3. Drugs and alcohol  
6.3.1.  On 5 Octo ber 2012 the CAA issued NPRM 13 -01 regarding the establishment of a specific 
drug and alcohol programme for adventure aviation operators.  The notice called for 
submissions on the proposed changes .  Three written submissions were received.  
6.3.2.  On 12 November 2012 the Minister of Transport approved the changes  to Part 115 Adventure 
Aviation – Certification and Operations, including the addition of new Rule 115.62 Drug and 
Alcohol Programme.  The new Rule require d an adventure aviation operator certificate 
applicant to:  
   Establish a drug and alcohol programme for monitoring  and managing the  
 risks  relating to the use of any drug, or consumption of alcohol by - 
 
   (1)  any crew member ; 
   (2)  a tandem master ; 
   (3) a ground crew member ; 
   (4) any other person whose work directly affects the safety of an  
   adventure aviation operation.  
6.3.3.  Adventure aviation operator certificate applicants are also required to include within their 
exposition s the details of the ir drug and alcohol programme s, and the means of ensuring that 
adventure aviation operation s did not take place were people  referred to above found to be 
impaired by such substances.  The new Rules applied to new certificate applicants, while 
current certificate holders as at 15 December 2012 were required to amend their exposition s 
by 15 March 2013.  In the meantime all certificate holders were required to have available the 
details required by the new Rules.  
6.4. Ballooning    
6.4.1.  On 29 November 2012 the CAA issued NPRM 09 -02, Part 61 Pilot Licences and Ratings, 
Docket  4/CAR/4 .  The NPRM included the introduction of a private pilot licence (balloon) and 
a balloon instructor rating.  The final date for submissions on the NPRM was 11 January 2013.  
The new ballo on licence and rating were proposed to be in effect within 12 months of the new 
Rule being approved.  
6.4.2.  On 22 April 2013 the CAA issued a new flight test standards guide for the commercial pilot 
licence (balloon) and biennial flight reviews for licen sed ballo on pilots.   These brought  
commercial balloon pilots in  to line with other commercial licence holders.  
6.5. ARCs  
6.5.1.  The CAA advised the Commission that in response to the review of ARCs a range of actions 
had been taken to address “underlying issue s of coordination, management, resource 
allocation and record keeping”.  These include d: 
 Additional fulltime dedicated resource assigned for the management and 
coordination of ARC investigation;  
 Additional resources allocated to the oversight of adventure avia tion, including 
commercial ballooning, and General Aviation sport and recreation activity;  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 45 >>
  Enhancement of safety analysis capability to support intelligence led, risk based 
interventions across the CAA;  
 The development and promulgation of the CAA Regulator y Operating Model and 
the supporting Regulatory Tools Policy to provide clear and consistent direction to 
all staff on priorities for safety interventions and to support decision making on 
these. Collectively these support a more proactive and focused appr oach to 
identifying and managing safety risk — one that is intelligence led and risk -based.  
They also support the use of a broader regulatory toolkit to influence safety 
outcomes — the right tools used in the right way at the right time ; 
 The development o f enhanced policies to support the consistent and coordinated 
management of ARCs across the CAA that reflect the Regulatory Operating Model 
and the Regulatory Tools Policy;  
 Restructuring has resulted in what was the General Aviation Group now sitting 
withi n the Operations and Airworthiness Group (previously the Airlines Group) to 
support a more consistent approach to management decision making and 
performance management;  
 Intensive training has been provided to managers to support professional 
performance ma nagement practices. This includes training on setting 
performance objectives and is designed to improve the quality of staff 
performance objectives. Further support as required in the form of refresher 
training and one -on-one coaching for managers has been  undertaken by senior 
Human Resources staff, and improved documentation for 2012/13 Performance 
Review and Development agreements was developed.  
More generally in respect of the adventure aviation sector the following 
developments and activities have occur red since January 2012 that contribute to 
enhanced levels of safety in that sector:  
 The introduction of Civil Aviation Rule Part 115 - Adventure Aviation – 
Certification and Operations . This came into effect in late 2011 and resulted in 
all adventure aviation operations involving hot air balloons, hang gliders, 
paragliders, tandem parachuting, and parachute drop aircraft to be certificated 
by 1 May 2012. Microlight aircraft adventure op erations required certification 
from1 Nov 2012 and those involving gliders must be certificated by 1 May 2013. 
The rule requires operators to have appropriate management systems, 
structures, and operating procedures in place to ensure compliance with the 
relevant safety standards, employees are appropriately qualified, and trained, 
equipment is appropriate to the task and properly maintained, and key people 
are fit and proper to undertake their responsibilities ; 
 Audits of all Part 115 Operators on their com pliance with existing obligations they 
have under the Health and Safety in Employment (HSE) Act 1992 to manage 
hazards posed by a drug or alcohol impaired employee;  
 Amendments to Rule Part 115 to add specific requirements for Operators to 
manage the hazard s posed by substance impairment.

 Final report 12 -001 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues . 
7.2. In the interests of  transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents . 
Recommendations  
7.3. On 15 February 2012 the Commission made the following urgent safety recommendation:  
The Commission re commends that the Director of Civil Aviation:  
  (a) conduct an urgent check on all maintenance organisations and licensed   
  engineers approved to maintain hot -air balloons to ensure that their balloon  
  maintenance practices fully comply with Civil Aviati on Rules, and  
  (b) satisfy himself that all New Zealand -registered hot -air balloons are airworthy . 
  (001/12)  
7.4. On 17 February 2012 the Director of Civil Aviation replied in part:  
I accept the thrust and intent of the recommendations made by the Commission.   
However, with respect to recommendation (b), I cannot accept it as it is written, as it 
goes beyond the scope of my responsibilities as Director of Civil Aviation under the 
Civil Aviation Act.  The Act is clear about the respective responsibilities and 
accountabilities of participants: in particular for those who operate aircraft.  Those 
individuals are responsible and accountable for ensuring aircraft are airworthy.  
Notwithstanding my comments above about recommendation  (b) I can advise the 
following:  
The CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] initiated a safety investigation into the maintenance 
practices associated with balloon ZK -XXF on 15 February 2012  
The CAA investigation will also examine maintenance practices associated with other 
balloons maintained by t he maintenance provider of ZK -XXF 
The CAA investigation will identify any other issues associated with the maintenance 
practices, and thus airworthiness, of balloons in New Zealand  
The CAA investigation is being undertaken as a matter of urgency, with an i nitial 
report from the investigation team due on 29 February in relation to the first bullet 
point.  
The CAA views the issues identified by the Commission very seriously and will act 
swiftly to address any deficiencies found in maintenance practices that pl ace in 
doubt the airworthiness of hot air balloons operated in New Zealand.  As a 
consequence of the advice received from the Commission, the CAA has amended 
the Terms of Reference for its investigation to more expressly address the 
maintenance and airwort hiness issues of all hot air balloons as the third stage of the 
investigation.  
7.5. On 11 October 2013  the Commission made the following recommendation to the Secretary for 
Transport:  
The post -mortem toxicology results for the pilot in the Carterton hot air bal loon showed that he 
had a positive result for tetrahydrocannabinol (a constituent of cannabis).  It was likely that 
this was due to 2 factors : first, the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the accident flight ; 
and, second, residual tetrahydrocannabinol , from ingesting cannabis over a longer term, 
redistributing in the pilot’s blood after his death.   
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 47 >>
  
The Commission found that the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot.  It 
also found that it could not exclude the possibility that the p ilot’s performance had been 
impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis.  
 
This is not the first time that the Commission has inquired into occurrences w here persons 
operating aircraft , vessels or rail vehicles, or where persons performing functions directly  
relevant to the operation of these, have tested positive for performance -impairing substances 
such as illicit drugs and alcohol.  The Commission is increasingly seeing more occurrences 
where the use of performance -impairing substances is a feature.   
 
Unless this safety issue is properly addressed , further occurrences where the use of 
performance -impairing substances is a contributing factor will occur.  Legislative or regulatory 
reform in this area is necessary.  
 
The Commission, therefore, recommends that  the Secretary for Transport complete, as a 
matter of priority, all necessary work that will support the introduction of appropriate 
legislation or rules that will:  
 prescribe allowable maximum levels for alcohol  
 prohibit persons from operating an aircraft,  vessel or rail vehicle if they are impaired by 
drugs  
 require operators to implement drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regimes , 
including random testing  
 prescribe post -occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol.  
 
This legislation or the se rules should apply:  
 across the aviation, maritime and rail transport modes  
 to persons operating an aircraft or a marine craft for recreational purposes.   (012/13 ) 
7.6. On 21 October 201 3, the Secretary for Transport replied:  
Below is the Ministry’s response to the final recommendation, noting at this date 
that I have not seen the final report.   
I wish to note that the determination of the need for legislation or rules is a matter 
for the Minister of Transport, rather than the  Secretary for Transport. The Ministry’s 
response to the recommendation is prepared with this in mind.   
I also note that the inquiry’s findings conclude that the accident was caused by 
errors of judgement by the pilot, but include the possibility that the pilot may not 
have been impaired. Before I respond to the recommendation I would like to take 
this oppor tunity to comment on relevant work in the transport sector.  
Drug and alcohol impairment in the aviation, maritime and rail sectors  
Alcohol and drug impairment in the transport sector is an issue that the Ministry 
takes very seriously. Impairment in drivin g is one of the largest causes of serious 
road crashes in New Zealand, contributing to about a third of all road deaths every 
year.  
The impact of drug and alcohol impairment on the aviation, rail and maritime sectors 
has been an area of focus for the Mini stry. Following the review of safety practices 
within the adventure and outdoors commercial sectors conducted by the previous 
Department of Labour, in August 2012 the Government agreed to amendments to 
aviation and maritime rules to improve safety in these  sectors. These amendments 
are now in force and include a requirement for adventure activity operators to 
include a description of how they will manage the safety risks associated with drug 
or alcohol impairment in their relevant safety plans (Organisation al Management 
Systems for aviation and Safe Operational Plans for maritime).  
 

<< Page 48 >>
 Final report 12 -001 To assist maritime operators, Maritime New Zealand has produced safety guidelines 
for managing risks related to alcohol and other drugs for raft and jet boat operators. 
The Mari time Transport Amendment Bill 2013, which has had its third reading and 
will come into force in the next few weeks, will implement the internationally 
applicable alcohol limit for merchant seafarers established by the 2010 
amendments to the International C onvention on Standards of Training, Certification 
and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1995 (STCW).  
The Civil Aviation Authority has worked closely with adventure aviation operators to 
support the development and implementation of drug and alcohol management 
policies that include testing. A detailed advisory circular for adventure aviation 
operators outlines the expectations for drug and alcohol monitoring and 
management, and what acceptable policies should include.   
Many transport operators, particularly thos e involved in transporting members of the 
public, already have drug and alcohol management policies in place in the 
workplace. Operators regard this as good business practice and meeting the duties 
of employers and employees set out in the Health and Safet y in Employment Act 
1992. Some operators that are involved in safety sensitive activities, such as Air 
New Zealand, Qantas, KiwiRail and Maersk Line have also introduced drug and 
alcohol policies involving testing regimes.  
Statistics from the New Zealand Drug Detection Agency show that the number of 
workplace drug tests carried out in New Zealand increased 31 percent between 
2011 and 2012, with an increase in alcohol tests of 32 percent over the same 
period. These results suggest that employers in safety s ensitive areas, including 
transport, are taking workplace safety very seriously.   
Drug testing on the road  
The drug driving regime has been in force for just under four years. The Ministry has 
a project on its work programme to investigate developments in  drug screening and 
testing technologies (and associated issues) that have occurred over this time. This 
work is due to take place during 2014.     
Post accident testing  
Aviation, maritime, and rail legislation does not currently provide for transport 
agen cies, the Commission, or Police (except in relation to the STCW alcohol regime 
for international or large domestic vessels) to conduct toxicological tests following an 
accident. Only when a fatality occurs can a Coroner test for the presence and level of 
drugs and alcohol in the deceased as part of the post mortem investigation.  
As a result there is a lack of New Zealand data to quantify the extent of alcohol and 
drug use in the aviation, maritime, and rail sectors, and its links to accidents and 
incidents.  In comparison, the road sector’s drug and random alcohol testing regime 
provides the necessary data to develop an understanding of the links between drug 
and alcohol use and accidents and incidents.   
Compulsory post accident testing would provide valuable  data on alcohol and drug 
use within the aviation, maritime and rail sectors in New Zealand. Aggregated data 
from the test results would inform future policy options, including the potential 
introduction of maximum limits and testing requirements, as noted  in the 
Commission’s recommendation.  
In order to establish whether there is a case for a compulsory post accident drug and 
alcohol testing regime, the Ministry has commissioned the New Zealand Institute of 
Economic Research (NZIER) to investigate and repor t on: 
 criteria to determine which accidents (and incidents) should be covered  
 who should be tested  
 the agency responsible for undertaking the testing  
 the testing procedures to be used (with reference to current national and 
international standards) in orde r to safeguard the integrity and accuracy of 
the testing  
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 49 >>
  an offences and penalties regime for refusing to be tested or interfering 
with test results or samples  
 the agency responsible for the data collection  
 the cost of implementing a compulsory regime  
 the legislative changes required to give effect to a compulsory regime.  
Once we have the NZIER report, we will brief the Minister of Transport on the options. 
We expect to be able to do this in December 2013. The Minister may then need to 
take a paper to Cabinet regarding any further work.  
Response to recommendation  
This bri ngs me to the Ministry response to your recommendation that the Ministry 
completes the work necessary to support the introduction of legislation or rules that 
will: 
1. Prescribe allowable maximum levels for alcohol;  
2. Prohibit persons from operating an aircraft , vessel or rail vehicle if they are 
impaired by drugs;  
3. Require operators to implement drug and alcohol detection and 
deterrence regimes, including random testing; and  
4. Prescribe post occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol.  
The completion of the first three parts of the recommendation is dependent on the 
fourth, prescribing post occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol. As I 
have discussed earlier in this letter, the Ministry of Transport is already undertaking 
work, as a matter o f priority, to determine the case for a compulsory post accident 
testing regime.  
We will be able to confirm the next steps for post accident testing once the Minister 
has considered our advice. Of course we will keep the Commission informed of the 
progress  of the post accident testing proposal, as well as any other work that relates 
to the Commission’s recommendation.  
Finally, like the Commission, the Ministry also believes there should be zero 
tolerance of operator impairment where members of the public ar e being 
transported by sea, rail and air. We feel very deeply for the families of those who lost 
their lives in this accident.

 Final report 12 -001 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Both long -term and recent use of cannabis may significantly impair a person’s performance  of 
their duties, especially those involving complex tasks .  Under no circumstances should 
operators of transport vehicles , or crew  members and support crew with safety -critical roles , 
ever use it.  
8.2. Power lines are a well-recognised critical hazard to hot -air balloon operations.  Balloon pilots 
should give them a wide margin and if they ever inadvertently encounter them, they should 
follow the balloon manufacturers ’ advice and best industry practice to mitigate the  possible  
consequences.

ANALYSIS  
The blood and urine were analysed for the presence of alcohol.  This analytical 
technique will also detect other volatile compounds  including those associ ated with 
decomposition.  
The blood was analysed for the presence of the majority of medical drugs that affect the 
mind, alter mood or cause sleep.  
The blood was analysed for a range of common analgesic medication.  
The urine was screened for evidence of the  use of amphetamine type stimulants, opiate 
type drugs, cocaine and cannabis.  
The blood samples were analysed for the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the 
active constituent of cannabis.  
The urine samples were analysed to determine the levels of THC -acid, the main 
metabolite formed after cannabis use.  
RESULTS and INTERPRETATION  
Alcohol  
TOX121281/1  Blood  Not detected  
TOX121281/3  Urine  5 milligrams per 100 millilitres  
Low levels of alcohol may be due to means other than deliberate ingestion.  
Volatile c ompounds associated with decomposition were also detected.  It is therefore 
possible that any blood and urine alcohol concentration existing at the time of death 
was changed by microbial action prior to sampling.  Microbial action can cause 
increases or de creases in blood and urine alcohol concentrations.  
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  
TOX121281/1  Blood  Approximately 2 micrograms per litre  
TOX121281/2  Blood  2 micrograms per litre  
Under normal conditions a blood THC level of 2 micrograms per litre would be consistent 
with [the pilot] smoking the equivalent of a single cannabis cigarette within 5 hours prior 
to death.  Blood THC levels may remain elevated for a longer period if canna bis is used 
frequently.

 Final report 12 -001 THC-acid (the main metabolite of THC)  
TOX121281/3  Urine  130 micrograms per litre  
TOX121281/4  Urine  120 micrograms per litre  
THC-acid is an inactive  metabolite of THC.  Urine levels can not  be used to indicate any 
degree of intoxication.  
Urinary levels of drugs cannot be interpreted by themselves because the levels can be 
significantly affected by the amount of fluid a person drinks and when they last urinated.  
The period of time that THC -acid can be detected in urine varies from days to weeks and 
depends on the frequency of the use of cannabis.  
No medical drugs that affect the mind, a lter mood or cause sleep were detected in the 
blood.  
No common analgesic medication was detected.  
There was no evidence in the urine for the use of amphetamine type stimulants, opiate 
type drugs or cocaine.  
The urinary screening test indicated the possible use of cannabis.  This is consist ent 
with the presence of THC in the blood.  
COMMENTS  
Tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)  
 Cannabis cannot be easily classified as a sedative or stimulant since it can have 
different effects in different people and its effects generally vary over time.  Its main 
psychological and behavioural effects are euphoria and relaxation, an impai rment of 
perception and cognition, and loss of motor coordination.   
Subjective symptoms of cannabis intoxication usually peak 10 to 15 minutes after 
smoking cannabis and last 1.5 to 4 hours.  
Blood THC levels produced by smoking a cannabis cigarette and th e rate at which the 
levels decrease vary widely between individuals and are dependent on a number of 
factors.  These factors include frequency of use, smoking technique and experience, and 
size and potency of the cannabis cigarette.   
Blood THC levels are generally a poor indicator of cannabis intoxication.  It is not usually 
possible to determine whether a subject was intoxicated based on blood levels alone.  
Because of the degree of trauma sustained I cannot be confident that the level of THC 
detected in the blood sample accurately reflects the level present immediately prior to 
death.  However, a level of 2 micrograms per litre indicates recent use and it is possible 
that [the pilot] was affected by the drug at the time of the crash.  
Peak levels of THC -acid occur in the urine within 6 hours after smoking cannabis.  
Because THC is absorbed into fatty tissues and slowly excreted as THC -acid, high levels 
of THC -acid may be detected in the urine of frequent users for several days.

ANALYSIS,  RESULTS and INTERPRETATION  
The blood and urine were analysed for evidence of the use of tobacco by the presence 
of nicotine, the main active component of tobacco, and the presence of cotinine, the 
main metabolite of nicotine.  
No nicotine or cotinine were  detected in the blood or urine.  
Nicotine levels in blood are generally low even immediately after smoking and levels 
drop rapidly.  Nicotine has a plasma half life of 24 to 84 minutes (average 40 minutes).  
The half life of a drug is the time it takes for  the level in the blood or plasma to drop by 
half. 
I would not expect to detect nicotine in the blood unless it was at a level that might be 
associated with toxicity.  
Cotinine has a longer plasma half life than nicotine, ranging from 14 to 21 hours 
(averag e 16 hours).  I don’t know if I would detect cotinine in blood after use of a single 
cigarette, but I would expect to detect it in the blood of a regular tobacco smoker.  
Levels of nicotine and cotinine in the urine of regular tobacco smokers is higher than  
blood levels.  I would expect to detect both components in the urine of a person who has 
recently smoked  tobacco.  Cotinine can also be detected in the urine of people passively 
exposed to tobacco smoke.

of forensic medici ne and pathology in the Coroner’s Court, Magistrate’s, County and 
Supreme Courts of Victoria and other states.  I undertake teaching of medicine, 
pathology, law and aviation related  subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.  
On June  4, 2012, at the  request of Dr Robin Griffiths, I reviewed the following materials 
relating to the accident:  
1. National News Report dated 7/1/2012 covering Hot Air Balloon crash in which 
there were 11 fatalities, Wairarapa, New Zealand.  
2. Report of Toxicological analysis perf ormed on specimens obtained from [the 
pilot] prepared by [ESR toxicologist].  
3. Report  of autopsy carried  out on Unidentified Male, DVI number 01 -0601 by 
[Forensic Pathologist] at Wellington Hospital, 10 January 2012.  
4. Supplementary report identifying Unknown Male DVI no. 01 -06-01 as [the pilot].  
5. Electronic communication from Dr Rob Griffiths stating further analysis of urine 
sample of [the pilot] showed THC level of 120 -130µg/l  [micrograms per litre] .   
On the basis of the above materials, I make the following  comments:  
1. Summary of Circumstances  
The deceased, [ name deleted ], was the pilot of a Hot air Balloon which departed for a 
sight -seeing flight from an area near Carterton, New Zealand on the 7/1/2012 with 11 
persons (pilot and 10 passengers) on board.  Appr oximately 45 minutes later, the 
balloon was seen to collide with powerlines, catch fire and crash to the ground, killing all 
eleven persons.  The bodies of the deceased were recovered and Disaster Victim  
Identification procedures undertaken.  The remains o f the pilot, [name deleted], were 
autopsied by forensic pathologist [name deleted] and cause of death was given as 
“Multiple blunt force and thermal injuries”.  Toxicological analysis was performed on 
specimens from the deceased, [name deleted], collected at autopsy and the results 
from ESR Laboratories showed the presence of THC (active cannabis metabolite) in 
blood at a level of 2 µg/l.  No other drugs or alcohol were identified in blood.  A very low 
level of ethanol was detected in urine along with other  volatile compounds which 
suggest post -mortem alcohol production as part of the process of decomposition rather 
than ingestion of ethanol.  Subsequent testing of urine sample from the deceased 
showed a THC level of 12 —130 µg/l.  
 
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 57 >>
 2. Opinion  
In general I agree with the comments regarding interpretation of the results of 
toxicological analysis made by [name deleted] of ESR Laboratories.  She states 
“Because of the degree of trauma sustained I cannot be confident that the level of THC 
detected in the blood sample accurately reflects the level present immediately prior to 
death.”  Interpretation of THC levels in post -mortem blood specimens is problematic, 
particularly (as in the present case) if the specimen is suboptimal (ie cavity blood from 
an extensively traumat ised body).  Other factors include the possible post -mortem 
redistribution of THC in blood (from tissue stores of the compound).  The finding of a 
level, however of 2 μg/l (2 micrograms per litre) in blood, strongly suggests recent use of 
cannabis by the d eceased in the hours prior to the accident.  This is supported by the 
presence of THC -acid in the urine.  
The effects of cannabis use in an individual are extremely variable and include such 
factors as history of usage (that is, chronic as opposed to ‘one -off’).  Some research 
suggests that a blood level of 5 μg/l and above causes cognitive impairment however 
blood levels of THC tend to decline quite rapidly after use (several hours) whilst studies 
have shown (specifically flight simulator studies in pilots ) that cognitive deficits can 
persist at least up to 24 hours following cannabis use (the ‘carry -over effect’).  This 
leads to the conclusion that direct correlation of cognitive impairment with blood levels 
of THC is also problematic.  
The testing of the b lood and urine specimens obtained from the deceased, [name 
deleted] by ESR Laboratories was directed at the active metabolite of cannabis, that is 
∆9-THC.  Levels of this compound give the best indication of recent usage, unlike the 
inactive metabolite, 11 -nor-∆-tetra hydrocannabinol -9-carboxylic acid (THC acid) which 
can persist in blood and urine for days following cannabis use and has not been 
demonstrated to correlate with cognitive impairment at all.  
3. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the pilot of this hot -air balloon, which crashed resulting in the death of all 
persons on board, was shown to have the active metabolite of cannabis in blood at a 
level of 2 μg/l.  Whilst this level may not accurately reflect the actual blood level at the 
time of death, it strongl y suggests recent cannabis use (4 -6 hours prior to death).  This 
in turn suggests that at the time of use (within the 4 -6 hour time -frame) the blood levels 
of THC would have been much higher and the likelihood of cognitive impairment also 
high.  Cognitive impairment at or around the time of the accident cannot be excluded, 
given the ‘carry -over’ effect of cannabis.  
The testing of the specimens by ESR Laboratories and the report issued including the 
comments by [name deleted] appear to be entirely appropriat e.

REQUEST  
At the request of [the Police], I have reviewed the post -mortem toxicology results for [the 
pilot] who was the pilot of a hot air balloon that crashed killing all 11 people on board on 
the 7th of January 2012.  I h ave been asked to give an opinion on the significance / 
meaning of the finding of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in [the pilot’s] blood and THC -acid 
(THCCOOH) in his urine.  
DOCUMENTS REVIEWED TO FORM THIS OPINION  
1. The autopsy report of [the pilot] carried out by [the pathologist] on the 10th of 
January 2012.  
2. The photographs taken at the time of the autopsy.  
3. The toxicology reports from [ESR], dated 14th of March and 23rd of May 2012.  
4. An opinion provided by Dr Shelly Robertson of Forensair dated the 4th of June 2 012.  
5. A job sheet entitled “Operation Enoka” from [the Police] dated the 31st of July 2012  
SPECIFIC INFORMATION PROVIDED BY [THE POLICE]   
1. [The pilot] was known to smoke cannabis on a regular basis and has done so for a 
prolonged period of time (i.e. more than months).  
2. [The pilot] was not known to smoke cigarettes.  
3. [The pilot] was an experienced balloon pilot and had an impeccable safety record 
over 10 years.  
4. A witness has stated that she saw [the pilot] smoking what looked like a cigarette 
shortly before t he balloon took off.  
REVIEW OF AUTOPSY REPORT AND AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS   
The salient points taken from the autopsy report by [the pathologist] and the review of 
the autopsy photographs were that [the pilot] suffered multiple blunt force traumas with 
extensiv e tissue disruption and burns.  The body was in a moderate state of 
decomposition and had abundant  post-mortem larvae activity.

influence of cannabis at the time of the crash.  
COMM ENT 
The subject of post -mortem toxicology is a specialized area of forensic toxicology in 
where the rules and assumptions that apply to the principles of pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics in the living require special precaution and interpretation.  Mo st, if 
not any, of these assumptions cannot be applied to post -mortem interpretation.  To give 
a full and complete review of the subject with extended medical and scientific 
explanation and references would require the production of a voluminous thesis abo ve 
and beyond that required for a Ph.D.  This report will attempt to capture the main issues 
in layman’s language.  
Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs worldwide.  Like alcohol, it is known to 
have a plethora of effects and affects on the human bo dy (this is called 
pharmacodynamics) with some people showing euphoria and docile states to some who 
become paranoid and aggressive.  Chronic use, similar to alcohol, can induce a degree 
of tolerance but unlike alcohol, chronic cannabis use results in metabolites (when taken 
the body  causes chemical changes to assist in eliminating it from the body, this is called 
pharmacokinetics) accumulating within various tissues of the body.  Cannabis is known 
to be lipophilic (that is to say it dissolves better in  fat than it does water).  The more you 
ingest cannabis, the more that becomes sequestered within fat stores of the body.  
Cannabis is metabolised to several compounds but mainly to forms called Δ9 -
tetrahydrocannabinol or THC (has pharmacological activity) and 11 -nor- Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol or THCCOOH (has no pharmacological activity).  
If I was to recommend one scientific paper that gives some insight into the complexities 
associated with interpreting cannabis and its metabolites in living humans, I would 

<< Page 60 >>
 Final report 12 -001 suggest a paper co -authored by Martin Huestis etal. (1). Work is currently underway, and 
has been for sometime, in Australia by Prog Olaf Drummer on the post -mortem changes 
to cannabis (personal communication with Prof Drummer).  This work is finding simila r 
variations with cann abis in post -mortem samples under much more controlled 
conditions that what we have in this case.  Huestis et al’s paper clearly demonstrates 
that when known chronic users are sequestered into a clinical environment and 
deprived of ca nnabis for seven days, their blood and urine levels of THC and THCCOOH 
vary considerably including an apparent increase, despite a bstinence.  Similarly 
Drummer et al. have looked at Cannabis in post -mortem samples and have found a 
similar oscillation in bl ood values from the same patient over 48 -72 hours (personal 
communication).  
The essences of this paper, and others that are out there, compel you to be cautious 
when considering the post -mortem result.  
After death the human body undergoes a process of decomposition which involves 
breaking -down of tissues resulting in the release of stored metabolites (for some drugs 
and not all).  This is particularly relevant to lipophilic compounds and THC is one such 
metabolite.  Given the fact that [the pilot’s] remains lay for two days in the summer sun 
exposed to the elements, the sample that is labelled blood cannot be considered 
anything near to whole blood as you may understand the term blood.  It was a sample 
consisting of an admix of blood, fat, proteins, and decompositional fluid among under 
substances (as given by the toxicology results under volatiles).  
As pointed out above under “Critical Points to Consider when Interpreting Post -mortem 
Toxicology”, you must  consider whether the person is a naïve user, intermittent or 
chronic user of a drug.  When looking at a value of 2 micrograms per litre (that is 2 parts 
THC per million) of THC in such a sample under these conditions, you can not draw a 
firm conclusion of  acute exposure in a person known to be a chronic user of cannabis, 
as was [the pilot].  The 2 micrograms may well be stored THC from previous exposures 
that re -distributed and / or leached from fat stores during decomposition.  It is entirely 
possible tha t if a blood ample was drawn from [the pilot] minutes before he lifted off 
that morning, it may have shown  levels of THC less than 2 micrograms per litre in his 
blood.  
You can infer that it represents recent use in a person known not to take cannabis or to  
take it on an infrequent basis.  You simply cannot infer that it represents recent use in a 
chronic user.  The THCCOOH in the urine is known to be detectable for many days after 
the last exposure in a chronic user, up to 10 -13 days after last use.  
The sug gestion, by Dr Shelley Robertson in her conclusions, that the level of 2 
micrograms of THC in [the pilot’s] blood strongly suggests recent cannabis use and that 
in turn this suggests that his blood levels would have been much higher in 4 -6 hours 
before dea th is erroneous and fails to take into consideration critical facts (i.e. [the pilot] 
was a chronic user).  
Equally the suggestion by [ESR] in her report that the result of 2 micrograms per litre 
suggests recent use has no scientific reliance  (a fact sh e points out).  
Their suggestions cannot be disproven beyond scientific and medical certainty due to 
problematic delay between the incident and the recovery of the post -mortem samples.  
In the four days between the incident and retrieval of the blood sample on which the 
toxicity is based, the vital information that may have answered this pivotal question was 
irretrievably lost.  
In order to address the allegation that [the pilot] was smoking either a cigarette or 
something else just before the balloon took off, I  requested that cotinine (found in urine 
of tobacco smokers) be looked for in his urine and this proved negative supporting the 
assertion that [the pilot] did not smoke tobacco.  Therefore it remains to be considered 
that if [the pilot] was smoking cannabi s (pure cannabis) that morning, was he such a 
cavalier character that he would have openly smoked cannabis in full view of his ground 
crew let alone his passengers immediately prior to take off?

 CONCLUSIONS  
The toxicology results from the decomposing sam ples taken from [the pilot] three days 
after the balloon crash support the established fact that he was a chronic smoker of 
cannabis (THCCOOH in urine) and he did not smoke tobacco.  The results do not prove 
that he smoked cannabis on the morning of the fl ight.  It is entirely probable that he did 
not smoke cannabis for several days prior to the incident.  There is no definitive 
evidence to suggest he was under the influence of THC at the time of the incident and 
the THC found may well have resulted from po st-mortem redistribution.  The THC does 
not prove recent use in a chronic user (i.e. within a 4 -6 hour timeframe).  
If there is still a question as to whether [the pilot] smoked cannabis in full view of ground 
crew and customers that morning then these resu lts cannot disprove it beyond doubt.  
The other circumstances, context and established behaviours of [the pilot] that morning 
may prove decisive as these results may simply reflect the known fact that [the pilot] 
was a chronic smoker of cannabis.

 Final report 12 -001 Appendix 4: Review of toxicology report results  
The ESR provided further comment as follows;  
Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, the active constituent of cannabis, was 
found in [the pilot’s] blood sample at a level of 2 micrograms per litre.  11 -Nor-9-
carboxy -Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC -acid, the main urinary metab olite 
of THC, was detected in [the pilot’s] urine sample at a level of 120 to 130 micrograms 
per litre. THC -acid is an inactive metabolite, it has no effect on a person.  
These findings could be consistent with [the pilot] smoking cannabis 90 minutes prior  to 
his death.  However, use of cannabis at an earlier time cannot be ruled out.  
Under normal circumstances, a blood THC level of 2 micrograms per litre would indicate 
recent use of the drug, anywhere from 0.5 to 5 hours of the sample being taken, if a 
single fairly low potency cannabis cigarette had been smoked.  Levels may be expected 
to remain elevated for longer if more than the equivalent of a single cigarette is smoked, 
if the cannabis is more than average potency or if cannabis is used frequently.  
THC is a lipophilic drug.  It moves rapidly from a watery medium like blood, to tissues 
that contain fat.  When cannabis is smoked, blood THC levels peak during the time the 
cigarette is being smoked.  The levels drop rapidly as the THC is distributed into the 
tissues.   
There have been many studies conducted on THC levels following smoking cannabis.  
Most of the reported smoking studies have analysed plasma rather than whole blood.  
The plasma/blood ratio of THC is between 1.5 and 2. That means a THC plasma  level of 
2 micrograms per litre is equivalent to 1 to 1.3 micrograms of THC per litre in whole 
blood.   
The length of time THC may be detected depends, among other things, on the potency of 
the cannabis.  These smoking studies involved smoking cannabis wi th potencies of 
1.75% and 3.55%, which are likely to be lower than the current average potency of 
cannabis.  These studies also used volunteers who had no THC in their plasma prior to 
smoking.  A number of studies, summarised in a paper by the same author found that 
THC plasma levels declined below 2 micrograms per litre within 6 hours (equivalent 1 to 
1.3 micrograms per litre of whole blood).  Considering the results of nine separate 
smoking studies a level of 2 micrograms of THC per litre of blood could o ccur anywhere 
from 0.5 to 5 hours after smoking.   
New Zealand drivers who have been found impaired due to cannabis use, and failed to 
satisfactorily complete an impairment test conducted by Police, had THC blood levels 
ranging from 0.2 to 36 micrograms pe r litre (average 5.8 micrograms per litre).   
If cannabis is smoked frequently, such as daily, THC will accumulate in the body tissues.  
How much accumulates will depend on how frequently the drug is used and the potency 
of the cannabis.   
In this case, th e blood sample provided for analysis had been taken at autopsy from the 
body cavity, 3.5 days after the time of death.  Due to the time delay and the degree of 
trauma, it is likely that the analytical sample was not representative of the blood 
immediately prior to death.  Some decomposition and mixing with other body fluids is 
likely to have occurred.  
Decomposition and/or the mixing of blood with other body fluids may have resulted in 
an increase or decrease in the THC level as detected in the sample analys ed compared 
with the level in the blood immediately prior to death.  The possible effect that any 
decomposition and mixing with other body fluids might have had on the level of THC 
detected, will depend on how often [the pilot] smoked cannabis.   
If he was  an infrequent user of the drug, less than once a week, I would not expect THC 
to accumulate in the body tissue.  Therefore, there would not be THC from previous use 
in the body tissue to be released into the body cavity fluid during the degradation of 
tissue following death.     
  
Final report 12 -001 
<< Page 63 >>
 If he used the drug more frequently, I can’t rule out the possibility that THC stored in 
tissue from previous use has resulted in elevation of the THC level in the sample 
analysed.   
The level of THC -acid in [the pilot’s] urine ind icates that it is possible he used cannabis 
more than infrequently.  If [the pilot] was an infrequent user of cannabis, and had not 
used cannabis in the previous week, he should not have had a significant residue of 
THC-acid in his urine.   
Peak levels of THC-acid in the urine don’t usually occur until at least 3 hours after use 
[11, 12].  A level of 120 micrograms of THC -acid per litre of urine is high for very recent 
use of cannabis by someone with no THC -acid already present in the urine.  In an ESR 
cann abis smoking study, THC -acid urine levels remained below 50 micrograms per litre, 
even after 7 hours, in those participants whose urine was drug free prior to smoking.  
Those participants whose urine was not drug free prior to smoking, achieved higher THC -
acid urine levels within an hour, some comparable to [the pilot’s] THC -acid urine level.   
Urinary THC -acid levels are of limited use because urine is always changing in 
concentration.  For example, if someone drinks a lot of fluid, their urine would be mo re 
dilute than someone who drinks less fluid.  If urine is dilute, any drug levels will be lower. 
To take this into account, the urine strength can be measured by the amount of 
creatinine present.  Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism found i n human 
urine.  Creatinine is excreted at a fairly constant rate, that is, about the same amount of 
creatinine is expelled from the body every day and this amount is relatively independent 
of the amount of fluid intake.   
Drug levels can be adjusted to tak e into account the urine strength.  The adjusted 
results are called “normalised levels for THC -acid”.  The normalised level is the ratio of 
the THC -acid level over the creatinine level.   
[The pilot’s] creatinine level was 926 micrograms per litre, therefo re a level of 120  
micrograms of THC -acid per litre of urine would be normalised to 130 micrograms per 
litre.   
In a reported study of the urinary excretion profiles of frequent and infrequent cannabis 
users, infrequent users were found to have THC -acid le vels above 100 micrograms per 
litre for up to two days after use.  Frequent users maintain THC -acid levels over 100 
micrograms per litre for four or more days.   
If [the pilot] was a very infrequent user of cannabis, use less than once a week, I would 
not expect such a high level of THC -acid in his urine so quickly after use.  Such a level 
may be expected if there was already THC -acid in the urine from previous use.  And if he 
had used cannabis frequently enough for THC -acid to be present in his urine prior  to his 
most recent use of the drug, it is possible THC was present in his tissues which may 
have elevated the level found in the cavity blood.   
Dr Robertson  commented as follows:  
At the time of compiling my original opinion regarding this case I was unaw are that the 
deceased, [the pilot was likely to have been a chronic user of cannabis. As I stated 
originally “Interpretation of THC levels in post -mortem blood specimens is problematic, 
particularly (as in the present case) if the specimen is suboptimal (i e cavity blood from 
an extensively traumatised body).  Other factors include the possible post -mortem 
redistribution of THC in blood (from tissue stores of the compound)”.  If in fact he was a 
chronic user, the issue of post -mortem redistribution of THC is  very likely to influence the 
blood level of THC determined at post -mortem and recent use may not necessarily be 
implied.   
I was also unaware of the witnessed account of the deceased smoking prior to the flight.  
I agree that the urine negativity for nico tine and cotinine strongly suggests that what was 
being smoked was not tobacco.   
In summary, I conclude that an active metabolite of cannabis (THC) was detected in the 
blood of the deceased, [the pilot] and whilst the actual blood level prior to the accid ent 
and the time of usage cannot be clearly determined by this result, the facts remain that 
the deceased was a cannabis user and cognitive impairment at or around the time of
