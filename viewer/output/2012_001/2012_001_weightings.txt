","0.0","30.0","The pilot made several errors in judgment, such as allowing the balloon to descend below the level of power lines and attempting to out-climb the power lines instead of initiating an emergency descent (5.2, 5.4, 5.7). ""The accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot"" (5.10). These actions directly contributed to the collision with the power lines and the subsequent accident.
","0.0","0.0","The pilot was experienced with over 1000 hours of ballooning and familiarity with the local area (4.3.1). There is no indication that a lack of training or competency contributed to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence to suggest that the pilot's training or familiarity with the balloon equipment contributed to the accident (4.3.1, 4.4.3).
","0.0","0.0","The accident involved a single pilot, and there is no mention of crew resource management issues contributing to the accident.
","0.0","20.0","The pilot did not have a current medical certificate as required by Civil Aviation Rules, showing a disregard for compliance with safety rules (5.8). Additionally, the pilot's decision to try to out-climb the power lines instead of descending rapidly as recommended in the event of an imminent collision with power lines indicates a failure to adhere to safety procedures (5.7).
","0.0","15.0","The pilot's behavior, including flying without a current medical certificate and the likelihood of smoking cannabis before the flight, suggests issues with the safety culture (5.8, 5.9, 5.10). The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning was also not sufficient to ensure a safe industry (5.12).
","0.0","1.667","There is no specific mention of a failure in risk management and analysis contributing to the accident, although the lack of regulatory oversight could be indirectly related (5.12).
","2.887","11.667","The regulatory oversight of commercial ballooning was not sufficient to ensure a safe and sustainable industry for the New Zealand public (5.12). The pilot's operation without a current medical certificate also indicates a lack of compliance with Civil Aviation Rules (5.8).
","2.887","8.333","The pilot's situational awareness may have been compromised, as evidenced by the decision to descend below the power lines and the failure to initiate an emergency descent after the collision with the power lines (5.2, 5.7).
","2.887","5.0","Although the emergency services responded promptly, the nature of the accident and the intense fire meant that a faster response would not have improved survivability (4.5.10). The pilot's failure to initiate an emergency descent also indicates a lack of preparedness for such a situation (5.7).
","0.0","3.333","While no mechanical or envelope defect contributed to the accident, the maintenance documentation for the balloon was substandard, indicating potential issues with maintenance and inspection regimes (4.4.3, 4.4.4). However, this did not directly contribute to the accident.
","2.887","0.0","The accident did not involve issues related to the use of automation.
","0.0","0.0","The weather conditions were suitable for the balloon flight that morning, and there is no indication that weather conditions played a role in the pilot's decision-making (5.1).
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence of communication breakdown contributing to the accident. Communication between the pilot and ground crew was normal (4.1.2).
","0.0","5.0","The pilot's potential impairment due to cannabis use is a factor that does not fit neatly into the predefined safety themes but is significant enough to warrant its own category. ""The possibility that the pilot's performance was impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis cannot be excluded"" (5.10). This could have affected the pilot's cognitive functions and decision-making abilities.","0.0","true","N/A"
