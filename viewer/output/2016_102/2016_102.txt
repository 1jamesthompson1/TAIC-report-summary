The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the cir cumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a pers on or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 25 October 2016 , a fully loaded coal train  had routed  from t he North Island Main Trunk line  
to a steep climb  on the Mission Bush Branch line at Paerata .  The train  suffered from wheelslip 
and stalled about 1.5 kilometres into the climb.  
1.2. The train driver radioed train control for assistance.  Train control arranged for a Mission Bush -
based pilot to guide the train as it reversed (set back) to Paerata , to attain more speed for a 
second attempt at the climb.  
1.3. To set back to Paerata the train had to pas s two signals.  Both of these signals were displaying 
red ('Stop') to protect another train that was passing through Paerata on the North Island Main 
Trunk line.  Both the pilot and the driver belie ved that the train controller had set these two 
signals to  green for their train to set back to Paerata.  
1.4. The train driver was driving from the locomotive at the front of the reversing train, from where 
he was unable to see the first of the two signals.  The pilot was positioned further down the 
track behind the t rain, from where he too was unable to see the first signal.  The train then 
reversed past the signal  at 'Stop '. 
1.5. The pilot then saw that the second signal near Paerata was display ing red and radioed the 
driver to stop the train.  The train stopped  with its rear-most wagon about 420 metres short of 
Signal 6RA and the North Island Main Trunk line.  The other train passed through Paerata just 
as the train came to a stop.  The potential for a collision between the two trains was high.  
1.6. The Transport Accident Inve stigation Commission  (the Commission)  found  that the train 
controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedures for reversing a stalled train, which contributed 
to the incident.  It also found that neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot 
was familiar with the correct procedure for setting back  a stalled train at Paerata.  
1.7. The Commission identified four safety issues : 
 the setback movement was not planned and carried out in accordance with the 
operating rules a nd procedures  
 KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff the replac ement  of an old 
procedure for recovering stalled trains at Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 
124(d) 
 the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a share d 
understanding of the limit for the setback authority, or of  the method of protecting 
the movement  
 the train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was directly involved in 
the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post -incident drug a nd alcohol test . 
1.8. The Commission has made two recommendation s to KiwiRail : to review its change 
management process to ensure that changes in policies, procedures and rules are 
communicated effectively to staff ; and to ensure  that all personnel directly involved in an 
accident and/or operating incident are asked to submit to drug and alcohol testing . 
1.9. Key safety lesson s arising from this incident are : 
 it is important that rail participants are familiar with and follow the approved 
rules and procedures that have been put in place to achieve safe railway 
operations  
 it is important that all staff involved in a railway operation have  a common 
understanding of what the plan is and how it will be carried out  safely , which is 
an essential aspect of non -technical skills .

 Final Report RO -2016 -102 2. Conduct of the inquiry   
2.1. On Tuesday 25 October  2016 , the NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission ( the Commission) of the  incident.   The Commission opened an inquiry 
under section 13(1) b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to 
determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence , and appointed an investigator in 
charge . 
2.2. Commission  investigators interviewed t he train controller on Tuesday 1 November  2016.  
2.3. The investigators travelled to Paerata the next day to conduct a site examination and to carry 
out a re -enactment of the setback movement  with a similarly  loaded scheduled coal tra in.  The 
exercise had to be  cancelled when  the scheduled coal train stalled near the same location 
where Train 140 (the train) had stalled on 25 October 2016.   
2.4. On 3 November 2016 , the investigators interviewed the train driver and the person who had 
piloted the train during the setback movement .  
2.5. The Commission obtained the following documents and records for analysis:  
 the Safe Working Authority form issued by the train controller for the  setback movement   
 KiwiRail's current instructions for setting back t rains on the mainline  
 the train control diagram and train control voice recording s of the setback movement   
 the train  control voice recordings for three similar setback movements on the Mission Bush 
line  
 the signal log output data for the movement of the train  through Paerata   
 the download data from the train's event recorder  
 witness statements  
 the training records for the train driver, the pilot1 and the train controller  
 the post -incident drug and alcohol test results for t he train driver and the pilot   
 the load schedule for trains operating on the Mission Bush Branch line (Mission Bush line)  
 the records of other  train stalls on the Mission Bush line  
 the track inspection and track maintenance records for the Mission Bush line . 
2.6. On 28 June 2017 , the Commissioners considered a draft report and approved it to be sent to 
interested persons for comment .  
2.7. Two written submissions were received.  The Commission considered the submissions, and 
changes as a result of those submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.8. On 24 August 2017 , the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 25 October 2016 , the train  was conveying 22 loaded coal wagons .  The route  was set for the 
train to travel from the North Island Main Trunk line (NIMT) to the Mission Bush  line via the Link 
Road2 at Paerata (see Figure 1). 
3.1.2.  The weather was overcast when  the train entered the Link Road at 08 43.  The Link Road track 
alignment was a tight  radius curve  with a rising gradient of 1 in 50 .  Trains were  restricted to a 
maximum line speed of 50 kilometres per hour  (km/h) through the Link Road .   
 
Figure 1 
Location of the incident  
 
3.1.3.  The train was travelling at 45 km/h3 when it entered the Link Road .  As the train travelled 
across Bridge 2 t he locomotive developed wheelslip4 and sand was applied automatically5 to 
improve  traction  (see Figure 2) .  The train driver made a brake application  and progressively 
reduc ed the power demand  from the maximum notch 8 to notch 6  to maintain traction . 
3.1.4.  The train stopped  at 0846 with the locomotive at  about the 1.5 kilometre (km)  mark on the 
Mission Bush line, some 100 m from the top of the incline .  The train driver then made two 
unsuccessful attempts to move the stalled train . 
3.1.5.  At 08 48 the train driver radioed  train control .  He reported that his train  had stalled at about the 
1.5 km mark on the Mission Bush line and requested assistance.  The train controller said that 
he would call a rail operator (pilot)  from the Mission Bush Terminal to pilot the train back on to 
the NIMT  at Paerata  via the Branch Main.   This was a procedure that had been used on 
numerous occasions when trains stalled on this gradient.  By setting back along the Branch 
                                                        
2 The Link Road is the direct connection track used by trains travelling between the northbound line of the 
NIMT and the Mission Bush line.  
3 Information on train speed and handling was sourced from the train event recorder.  
4 Wheelslip is a condition wher e the rotational speed of a locomotive wheel exceeds that of the actual 
directional speed of the locomotive.    
5 When wheelslip is detected, sand from a reservoir is automatically deposited onto the rail head in front of 
the driving wheels.  


<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -102 Main , the t rain could attain a higher speed and thus more momentum to climb the gradient.  
The pilot was required to act as the 'eyes' for the driver, because the driver was in the 
locomotive at the head of the train and unable to see the track and signals behind the  train as it 
reversed.   
 
Figure 2 
Location w here the train stalled  (not to scale)  
 
3.1.6.  The pilot drove to a location where he could see number 11 points6 at Paerata  (the points) .  He 
had telephoned and asked him  to have the train driver select local radio channel 45 so they 
could communicate.  On arrival, he carried out a radio check with the train driver , then informed 
him that he was in position for a setback movement.  He also confirmed that the points were 
correctly set for the setback movement to the Branch Main.  
3.1.7.  At 0921 the train driver switched radio channels to communicate with train control.  He 
reported that the pilot was in position, confirmed his location and requested authority to set  
back.  The train controller issued verbal instructions to the driver , who recorded them on a Safe 
Working Authority form.  At 0925 t he train controller acknowledge d that the driver had read 
back those instructions correctly.  The authority authorised the driver to set  back from the  
1.5 km mark on the Mission Bush line in accordance with fixed signals to Paerata.  The train 
controller said that [signal] blocking had  been applied to prevent any conflicting movements.  
Analysis of the signal log output data showed that signal blocking had not been applied before

from the Mission Bush line to the Link Road.  

  
Final Report RO -2016 -102 
<< Page 5 >>
 the train controller authorised the setback movement.  See Appendix 1 : Safe Working Authority 
Number 1711, a s recorded by the driver.  
3.1.8.  The driver then switched back to the local radio channel to communicate with the pilot.  He told 
the pilot that he had been issued with the authority to set  back.  They agreed on a radio 
protocol,  where  the pilot would transmit ev ery 10 seconds during the setback movement and 
the driver had to  stop the train if those radio transmission s ceased . 
3.1.9.  On 19 September 2012 , KiwiRail issued Special Bulletin 624 , Hazard Alert - Rail Bridges , that 
required all rail personnel to avoid walking on rail bridge/viaduct sleepers  and only use 
designated walkways and footways.  Bridge 2 on the Mission Bush line had not been fitted with 
such footways, and for safety reasons field staff had been instructed by local management not 
to walk across this bri dge.   
3.1.10.  The train driv er released the automatic brake  and the setback movement started at 0927:10.   
The train gradually picked up speed and at 0929:33 it was travelling at 16 km/h when the rear 
wagon passed Signal 10R , which was  displayi ng a red aspect ( 'Stop') (see Figure 3) .   
 
Figure 3 
Signal 10R at 'Stop ' 
3.1.11.  Signal 10R was displaying red because an empty northbound passenger train was approaching 
Paerata on the NIMT.  The coal train was required to stop at Signal 10R.  However, because of 
the curve in the track the driver was not  able to see  the signal from his driving position at the 
head of the train.  The pilot was also not able to see  from where he was positioned  beside 11 
points that Signal 10R was displaying a 'Stop' indica tion (see Figure 4).

Figure 4  
The pilot's view looking back towards the reverse side of Signal 10R from 11 points  
3.1.12.  Once the reversing train came into his view , the pilot  relocated to the eastern end of the Branch 
Main, where he saw that the next signal, Signal 6R B, was displaying a red aspect.  He 
immediately radioed the driver shouting,  'STOP, STOP, STOP '.  The train stopped at 0931:19 , 
with the front of the locomotive some 80 m past Signal 10R  and the  rear-most wagon about 
420 m short of Signal 6R B. 
3.1.13.  Meanwhile, t he train controller  noticed on his  display that the track past Signal 10R was now 
occupied.  He checked on another computer screen and saw that the train was movi ng.  He 
immediately made a radio broadcast to the train driver but the call was not responded to.  He 
made a further attempt, this time stating , 'Urgent, urgent , one, four, zero, one, four , zero, 
receiving ?'.  Again there was no response from the train driver.  
3.1.14.  The n orthbound empty passenger train was travelling on the adjacent NIMT line and was 
passing Signal 6R A at the exact time that the setback train stopped (see Figure 5).

 3.2. Drug and alcohol testing  
3.2.1.  KiwiRail had introduced its post -incident drug and alcohol testing policy and associated 
procedures during 2009 , with agreement from  the Rail and Maritime Transport Union.  The 
policy required employees directly  involved in serious accident s and/or operating incident s to 
be asked to submit to testing .   
3.2.2.  The KiwiRail n ational train control centre  had a supporting d ocument , Train Control, Traction 
Control and Signal Box Mandatory Relief and Support Matrix , which  described  the action to be 
taken when a train controller/traction controller/signaller's action or inaction could have been a 
contributing factor in an occurrence.  The matrix included a requirement for the train controller 
to undergo a drug and alcohol t est when a train was authorised to set  back without the correct 
authority.   
3.3. Key personnel  
 The train driver  
3.3.1.  The Te Rapa -based driver  had gained certification to drive freight trains on 17 July 2015.   
On 22 August 2016 , he had sat and passed seven separate theory revalidation papers , each 
with 10 multi -choice questions .   
3.3.2.  His most  recent  safety observation assessments had been  carried out on 27 July 2016 and  
19 September 2016.  The observer had recorded  the following comment at the conclusion of 
the latter  assessment : 
 … [he] has a very cautious approach to signals at Stop, calls all signals.   
3.3.3.  The train driver said that he had not previously stalled a train on the Mission Bush line, but he 
was familiar with the setbac k procedure .  He was aware that coal wagons were not fitted with  
safe riding position s, but thought that  the pilot had been  stationed to ensure the safety of the 
setback movement .  
3.3.4.  The train driver had been  off duty on Saturday 22 October 2016.  He had worked a 9.25  hour 
shift from 0200 the next day , finishing at 1115 .  At 0200 on 24 October  he had received a text 
message from the drivers' roster centre asking him to phone back.  He had done  so and been  
told that his 0400  start shift had been cancelled , but he had been  requested  to start work as 
soon as possible to relieve the driver of a late -running train.  He had been  at work by  0230 and 
had worked a 13.25  hour shift, finishing at 1545.   
3.3.5.  He said that he had been  feeling a bit tired when he was woken by his alarm at 0315  to prepare 
for his scheduled 9.75  hour shift starting at 0400  on 25 October 2016 . 
3.3.6.  He underwent a KiwiRail post -incident drug and alcohol test, which returned a negative result.  
The pilot 
3.3.7.  The pilot was qualified to carry out piloting duties.  His initial training for the Automatic 
Signalling Rules and Track Safety Rules had been  provided  on 10 April 2011 .  He  had passed 
the respective theory examinations the same day.  
3.3.8.  KiwiRail could not provide the records for his two -yearly theory revalidation s, which had been  
due before April 2013 and April 2015 . 
3.3.9.  He had been trained  to pilot trains that had stalled on the Mission Bush line.  During the 
practical training h e had been instructed to not cross Bridge 2  because there were no handrails 
fitted.    
3.3.10.  The pilot  said that he had piloted trains  on 20 -30 previous occasions , assisting  drivers of stalled 
trains to set back  from about the 1.5 k m mark along  the Branch Main  to the northbound line of 
the NIMT.  He had always positioned himself beside the points before the  train setback

The train controller  
3.3.12.  The train controller 's certification was current.  He had gained his initial certification on the East 
Coast Main Trunk line train control desk on 22 July 2010.  On 7 June 2011 , he had 
demonstrated  competency to operate the Waikato  and Taumarunu i desk , which  included the 
Mission Bush line.  He had gained further certification to operate  the Auckland metropolitan 
train control desk  in mid-2012 .  
3.3.13.  His most recent desk observation assessment had been  carried out on 13 September 2016.  
He had  undergon e a desk handover assessment on 21 September 2016.  No areas of concern 
had been  identified during these  assessment s. 
3.3.14.  KiwiRail did not arrange for the train controller to undergo  a post -incident drug and alcohol test .  
Train control managers had determined that there was no evidence that the train controller's 
actions had breached any operating procedures .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Although t here are commercial considerations for repeated train stallings on the Mission Bush  
line, a train stalling does not compromise  safety provided there are good , safe procedures to 
effect a recovery and those procedures are adhered to.  
4.1.2.  The following analysis outlines  what happened  and then discusses four safety issues that have 
implications for rail safety : 
 the setback movement  was not planned and carried out  in accordance with the operating 
rules and procedures   
 KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff about the replac ement  of an old 
procedure for recovering stalled t rains at Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 124 (d) 
 the train controller , the train driver  and the pilot  did not hav e a shared  understanding of 
the limit for the setback authority , or of  the method for protecting the movement  
 the train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was directly involved in the 
incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post -incident drug and alcohol test . 
4.2. What happened  
Train stalling  
4.2.1.  Trains can stall for a number  of reasons : train overload ing; locomotive perform ance ; driver 
skills ; and low-adhesion track  conditions.  Low -adhesion track  conditions are likely to occur 
when there is a combination of wet , windy weather and leaf drop onto the railhead  
(see Figure 6).  These conditions were present on the morning of this occurrence.   
 
Figure 6  
Overhanging vegetation near the 1 km  mark  
4.2.2.  KiwiRail operate s three coal trains per weekday from Rotowaro  to the Mission Bush Terminal.  
Each  train consist s of a single DL -class locomotive hauling 22 wagons.  T he tonnage hauled by 
a single DL -class locomotive from Paerata to Mission Bush  was restricted to a maximum  of 
1,520 tonnes .   


<< Page 10 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.2.3.  The declared weight for the train was 1 ,470 tonnes, within 3% of the maximum  allowable 
tonnage.  The train was made up of three separate classes of wagon, each class with its own 
tare and maximum gross weight.  An average gross wagon weight had to be used in the  
calculation of the train weight because there was no weighbridge for the wagons to pass over 
before departing.  The actual gross wagon weight could  vary due to the moisture level of the 
coal and the height to which each wagon was loaded , so the true train weight could not be 
determined accurately.  
4.2.4.  There had been 33 reported train stallings on the Mission Bush line between 12 April 2015 and 
25 October 2016, of which 26 had occurred within the first 2 km  of the line .  Further analysis 
showed that 23 of the 26 trains that had stalled were the first train s of the day.  
4.2.5.  KiwiRail reviewed the event recorder downloads from a number of trains that had stalled on the 
Mission Bush line.  A common theme was that drivers had been  maintaining notch 8 (maximum 
power demand) for too long.  
4.2.6.  Following trials on the Mission Bush line in mid-2016, KiwiRail had developed and documented 
an optimum driving method for the DL -class , locomotive -hauled coal trains  for best adhesion 
control under poor rail -adhesion conditions.  This optimum driving method required a driver to 
make a b rake application when the train speed fell to 30 km/h,  then select a lower power 
demand at predetermined speeds as the train slowed further . 
4.2.7.  A copy of the optimum driving method had been  distributed by local management on an 
informal basis , without discuss ion and without conducting a formal safety assessment . 
4.2.8.  The event recorder for the train involved in this in cident  showed that the driver entered the Link 
Road at the prescribed 45 km/h , then generally followed the optimum  driving technique .  He 
made a brake application when the train speed dropped to 44 km/h  before reducing power 
demand as the train speed continued to fall.  
4.2.9.  Driver technique is therefore unlikely to have contributed to the stall.  I t was likely that the train 
weight  exceeded the  capability of the locomotive in the track -adhesion  conditions.   
4.2.10.  Following this incident KiwiRail reduced the maximum number of wagons permitted to be 
hauled by a single DL -class locomotive on the Mission Bush  line from 22 wagons to 20.  Since 
then there have been no further reports of train stallings  (see paragraph  6.3). 
Train recovery  
4.2.11.  The train controller had three options for manag ing the recover y of the train : 
 attach a n additional  locomotive to the head of the train  
 attach an additional  locomotive to the rear of the train  
 authorise the train to set  back along the Branch Main to the northbound line of the NIMT , 
under controlled conditions , before signalling its return on  the longer and more gentle 
gradient on the Branch Main .  
4.2.12.  There were  no other locomotives available , so the train controller decided to  authoris e a train 
setback movement.  He knew that operating staff on duty at the Mission Bush  Terminal w ere 
appropriately qualified and that they had assisted drivers of stalled trains many times before .   
  
 
 
 
  
Final Report RO -2016 -102 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.3. Procedure  for setting back at P aerata on the NIMT towards Papakura  
Safety issue - the setback movement was not planned and carried out  in accordance with the 
operating rules and procedures . 
4.3.1.  On 7 February 2012 , KiwiRail  had issued Semi -Permanent Bulletin  69, which  deleted the Local 
Network Instruction , Section L1.1, Clause 6.1.4, Setting back at Paerata on the NIMT towards 
Papakura .  A KiwiRail risk assessment  had found that this and numerous other local 
instructions for setting back were adequately covered by the current Operating Rule 124, 
Propelling of Vehicles on Main Line . 
4.3.2.  Special Bulletin 624 , effective from 19 September 2012,  required all rail personnel to a void 
walking on rail bridge/ viaduct sleepers  and only use dedicated walkways and footways .  With no 
dedicated footway fitted to Bridge 2, local operational management had interpreted the Bulletin 
to mean rail personnel were not to walk over this bridge and  field staff were instructed 
accordingly.  The pilot was position ed beside 11 points when the setback movement started 
and from that location could not see the 'Stop ' indication displayed on Signal 10R .   
4.3.3.  Trains stalling before reaching the 2 km  mark on th e Mission Bush  line was not uncommon.  
More than 30 trains had stalled on that section of track in the 18 mont hs before this incident .  
4.3.4.  Operating Rule 124 stated in part:  
(a) A locomotive may propel a train or vehicle upon the main line when:  
(ii) a train is  stalled and has to set back  
4.3.5.  The coal wagons on the stalled train were not fitted with safe riding positions.  Under such 
conditions setback movements are carried out in accordance with Operating Rule 124(d)  that 
require s the train controller, the driver and the pilot to carry out a number of checks before the 
train controller authoris es the setback movement, including:  
 all three confirming the access route to the feature that require d protection with the pilot  
 the train controller establishing contact with the driver and pilot and agree ing the 
feature/location to which the movement would  set back (which could  be a level crossing, 
points, signal, metrage, board, structure, etc)  
 the train controller advising the tr ain driver  of the estimated setting back distance to the 
agreed feature/location.  
In this case, none of these checks was carried out before the movement authority was issued.  
From the train controller's perspective  
4.3.6.  The train controller issued the movement authority as shown in Appendix 1.  T he Safe Working  
Authority  form , in part, instructed the train driver to:  
 set back  from 1.50 km on the Mission Bush  line in accordance wi th fixed signals to 
Paerata  
 call 'clear and complete of  block section '. 
4.3.7.  The train controller's instruction . 'in accordance with fixed signals ' contained in the movement 
authority , required that either the driver or the pilot sight all the signals , including Signal 10R .   
4.3.8.  The train controller did not identify the feature /location when he stated  the limit for the setback 
movement.  'Paerata ' covered a wide area and therefore could not be considered  a clearly 
identif ied feature or location for the purpose of this setback movement.   
4.3.9.  The train controller had already given priority to the northbound empty passenger train through 
Paerata on the NIMT.  In doing so, the signalling system had prevented him placing Signal 10R 
at 'proceed '. 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.3.10.  At that time the re were only two options available to the train controller  if the KiwiRail 
procedures were to be followed.  The first was to set  back  the train to Signal 10R, being the only 
clearly distinguishable feature.  The second was to wait for the passenger train to clear the 
section so that  he could change Signal 10R to green , at which time the train could  set back to 
another clearly distinguishable feature within the Paerata area.  
4.3.11.  An analysis of the signal logs showed that the train controller did not block any signals to 
prevent conflicting movements  before he issued the movement authority , but he did so some 
four minutes after the train passed Signal 10R at stop and  two minutes after the train had 
stopped .  Instead he authorised the passenger train to enter the section of the NIMT that the 
coal train would have occupied had the pilot not seen the red aspe ct on Signal 6R B.  It is a 
concern that the train controller told the driver that he had applied blocking to the signals when 
he had not.  
4.3.12.  Had the train controller authorised  the limit of the setback authority a s Signal 10R, he would 
have needed the train driver to identify the precise location of the front of the stalled train  so he 
could determine the distance of the intended setback movement .  However, the distance from 
the rear of the stalled train to Signal 10R was only 401 m , so there was minimal  benefit in doing 
this.  
4.3.13.  Had the train controller stepped through the required procedure, it is highly likely that he would 
have realised that waiting  until the passenger train had cleared Paerata would have been the 
logical choice.  Had h e done so, the incident would not have happened .  Once the passenger 
train had passed , the train controller would have been able to set Signals 10R and 6 RB to 
'proceed ', thereby enabling  the stalled train to set  back in one continuous movement  past 
Paerata  Station entry board number 1 (a clearly distinguishable feature ) on the northbound line 
of the NIMT.  
4.3.14.  Following the incident the train controller had difficulty recalling the specific requirements of 
Operating Rule 124 (d) to the Commission investigators .  The train controller had not undergone 
any special t raining in or assessment on Operating Rule 124 (d) after the Automatic Signalling 
Regulations were introduced . 
From  the train driver 's perspective  
4.3.15.  Operating Rule 124(d) required the train driver to carry o ut a number of actions , which  includ ed: 
 confirming the estimated distance to the feature/location with train control  
 setting the head -end counter for the distance to the next agree d feature/location.  
4.3.16.  The train driver and the train controller did not  agree  on a clearly distinguis hable feature to 
which the setback movement would be  authorised.  As a consequence , the distance to that 
feature was not provided by the train controller , and the train driver could not  enter  a parameter  
into the locomotive distance  counter . 
4.3.17.  The train driver was expecting  to have green signals for the entire setback movement to Paerata 
for two reasons.  The train controller had told the driver that he  had applied blocking on  the 
signals to prevent any conflicting movements  and that h e was required to call 'train control ' 
when the train was clear and complete of the block section .  The driver  said that this was the 
first time that he had made the setback movement  on the Mission Bush line and he had been 
told by other drivers that the setback movement never started without first having authority to 
pass Signal 10R.   
4.3.18.  The driver displayed limited knowledge of the requirements of Operating Rule 124 (d).  He had 
only been driving for about 1 7 months at the time of the incident  and had not dr iven a train that 
had stalled  before .   
  
Final Report RO -2016 -102 
<< Page 13 >>
 From the pilot's perspective  
4.3.19.  According to the KiwiRail procedure , the pilot should have been issued with a radio capable of 
working on the train control frequencies.  However, t he pilot had been issued with a hand -held 
radio only capable of receiving and transmi tting on the local channel.  Consequently , he could 
not listen to  the train controller issuing the authori ty for the setback movement  over the 'open' 
radio channel  or have radio communication with them .  The procedure as described in 
Operating Rule 124(d) required the train controller, the driver and the pilot to agree on the 
procedure and the feature or location where the setback movement would terminate.   This non -
adherence to the procedure resulted in a  lost opportunity for the incident to be prevented 
through the intervention of the pilot.  
4.3.20.  Like the train driver, the pilot had assumed that the signals would be clearly displaying 
'proceed ' (green) for the entire setback movement.  This was the first time  out of about 30 that 
he had piloted such a movement when the the setback train had been required to stop at Signal 
10R. 
4.3.21.  His knowledge of Operating Rule 124(d) was limited , similar to the train controller and the 
driver .  His perception was that all signals  would be displaying green for the entire setback 
movement, which was a situation that he was  used to.  It could not be established whether he 
had been assessed for his knowledge of Operating Rule 124 (d), as KiwiRail was unable to 
produce the records of hi s most recent assessments, which is a concern.  
From KiwiRail's perspective  
Safety issue - KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff the replac ement  of an old 
procedure for recovering stalled trains at Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 124 (d). 
4.3.22.  Neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with 
KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124 (d), which had replaced the withdrawn local procedure for setting 
trains back at Paerata.  When a change is made within an or ganisation, it is important that it is 
communicated  effectively  and checks are made to ensure  it has been fully implemented.  
4.3.23.  It is generally not sufficient to make a change, broadcast it by way of a Bulletin, and then 
assume that all staff will have read and fully understood what is required . This is  particular ly if it 
involves a change to a long -established procedure, and one that has implications for transport 
safety.  
4.3.24.  This incident is an indication that KiwiRail's system for change  management could benef it from 
a review.  A recommendation has been made to KiwiRail to address this issue.   Since this 
incident , KiwiRail has revised its procedures to ensure  that pilots are equipped with radios 
capable of transmitting and receiving on the open train control fr equencies . 
4.3.25.  After  this incident, KiwiRail issued a Special  Bulletin on  3 November 2016 , stating in part:  
Trains stopping on the Mission Bush Branch between 0.00 km (Paerata) and 
11.80km (Glenbrook) MUST NOT setback/change direction.  
Note; this is an interim instruction until a review is completed.  
This Special Bulletin was still  curren t at the time this report was published . 
4.3.26.  The three safety actions taken by KiwiRail have effectively eliminated the risk s posed by a train 
stalling and setting back on the Branch Main .  Reducing the tonnage of the coal trains has 
reduced the frequency of trains stalling on the Mission Bush line.  Prohibiting the setback 
procedure at that location has eliminated the hazards a ssociated with piloting trains at a 
location where pilots have had difficulty positioning themselves where they can be  the 'eyes' for 
the train driver s.  Issuing  the pilots with radio s capable of receiving and transmitting on the train 
control frequencies will enhance communication between pilots, train control lers and train 
driver s in any operation s requiring pilot s.

 Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.4. Non-technical skills  
Safety issue  - the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have  a shared 
understanding of the procedure  that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority .  
4.4.1.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board of Great Britain define non-technical skills as, 'the 
cognitive, social and person al resource  skills that complement technical skills and contribute to 
safe and efficient task performance '.  While technical skills describe what you need to do and 
know for a given safety -critical task, non -technical skills describe how you do that task. The non -
technical skill components can be broken down further to sub -categories that include 
situational awareness, conscientiousness, communication, decision -making and action, co -
operati on and working with others, workload management and self -mana gement.   
4.4.2.  Analyses of incident and accident reports within the rail industry conducted by the Rail Safety 
and Standards Board showed that most  errors that occur red relate d to people at the frontline 
(63%) , rather than management (30%) and design factors (7%).  Making mistakes is inevitable , 
but the use of non -technical skills has been shown to help mitigate and manage these errors.  
For example, Queensland Rail reported that trainee drivers who did not complete non -technical 
skills training were more than twice as like ly to pass a  signal at danger within their first month 
than  those who had received the training.  Similarly, Canadian Pacific Railway reported a 46% 
reduction in human -caused incidents following non -technical skills training.   
4.4.3.  To carry out the train recov ery movement in a safe manner  at Paerata , all participants were 
required to have a common understanding  and shared mental model  of all aspects of the 
setback movement , but t his was not the case.  
4.4.4.  While the train driver was aware generally of the recovery procedure, he had not previously  
stalled a train at that location, so  relied on the instructions given to him by the train controller . 
4.4.5.  The train controller was clear in his mind that he had authorised the setback movemen t for the 
train to be carried out in accordance with fixed signals, and that was initially only to Signal 10R .   
4.4.6.  The train driver had recorded on his movement authority that , 'Blocking has been applied to 
prevent conflicting movements '.  This led him to believ e that he had been given  the authority to 
set back to the northbound line of the NIMT.    
4.4.7.  The train driver, after advising the pilot that he held a valid setback authority and agree ing on 
radio protocols, thought that the pilot was near  the rear of the train and able to see all facing 
signals.  In reality, n either of them was able to observe the displayed aspect. However, the 
driver had already discounted the possibility that the train controller had placed Signal 10R at 
'Stop'.  
4.4.8.  A review of the train control voice recordings from the previous four train stallings on the 
Mission Bush line showed that the movement authorit ies had been to Station Entry Board 1 on 
the NIMT , as both the driver and the pilot were  expecting on this occas ion.  It is essential that all 
parties are aware of, fully understand and comply with operating procedures when undertaking 
train recovery movements.   
4.4.9.  Although the train controller had been cer tified on the Waikato desk for more than five years, he 
had no t undertaken a site visit to the Paerata triangle and surrounds.  He therefore had a 
limited understanding of the environment and challenges under which the field staff were 
working during the setback movem ent.  Had he been more aware, he may have waited u ntil the 
empty passenger train had passed through Paerata before authorising the setback movement .  
4.4.10.  The Commission has raised the issue of non -technical skills training in three recent rail 
occurrence reports that are ready for publication.  All these reports include a reference to an 
open recommendation made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Ag ency during 2012.  
The recommendation required the pra ctice of non-technical skills to be recognised within the 
National Rail System Standards.  
  
Final Report RO -2016 -102 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.4.11.  On 3 April 2017 , the NZ Transport Agency stated that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail on 
this issue.  It added that it had issued a safety improvement plan notice during December 2016 
in accordance with section 36 of the Railways Act 2005 , requiring KiwiRail to prepare a safety 
improvement plan to addres s the implementation of non -technical skills in its stan dard rail 
operations.  
4.4.12.  At the time of publication the recommendation remains 'open' . 
4.5. Drug  and alcohol testing  
Safety issue - the train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was directly involved 
in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post -incident drug and alcohol test.  
4.5.1.  KiwiRail policy is that  staff must  present for  work free from the influence of drugs  and/or 
alcohol, including prescription and over -the-counter drugs.  KiwiRail conducts d rug and alcohol 
testing : pre-employme nt; when staff transfer from non -critical to safety -critical roles ; following 
accidents and incidents;  for reasonable cause ; and on a random  basis.  
4.5.2.  KiwiRail requires al l personnel directly involved in accident s or incident s to submit to drug and 
alcohol test procedure s.  Personnel are required to sign forms consenting to the tests.  T he 
alcohol test is to be conducted within one hour of an occurrence and a urine sample collected 
for the drug test within three hours  of it. 
4.5.3.  In this case , the train driver an d the pilot  were tested  and found to be clear .  However, the train 
controller was not asked to submit to drug and alcohol testing, even though he was directly 
involved in the incident  and was performing a safety -critical role.  
4.5.4.  It will not always be immedia tely apparent whether a person 's actions or inactions have 
contributed to an occurrence.  It sometimes only becomes apparent during  an investigation.  For 
this reason , manager s should not be able to exercise discretion  about  whether their staff are 
asked to submit to drug and alcohol testing .  All safety -critical staff involved in the 
circumstances of an accident or incident should be tested.  A recommendation has been made 
to KiwiRail to address this issue .  
  

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report RO -2016 -102 5. Findings  
5.1. It is likely that the train stalled on the Mission Bush line because the train was too heavy for the 
locomotive to haul it up the gradient in the track -adhesion conditions present at the time.  
5.2. The coal train would have been able to set back  safely  from the  Mission Bush line to the NIMT  
line at Paerata if the KiwiRail procedure for doing so had been adhered to.  
5.3. The train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedure as described in Operating Rule 124(d) 
for undertaking the setback movement for the coal train.  His n ot doing so was a contributing 
factor in the incident.  
5.4. Neither the train driver nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 
124(d) for setting  back  a train to questio n the train controller's plan to recover the stalled coal 
train.  
5.5. The KiwiRail system of change management was not effective in communicating to staff a 
change in procedures for setting back trains at Paerata and ensuring  that the change was fully 
implement ed. 
5.6. The train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not share the same concept of the plan for 
recovering the stalled train.  Consequently , a number of errors and erroneous assu mptions that 
contributed to the incident went unchallenged.  
5.7. KiwiRail's  procedures required the  train controller  to undergo a  mandatory  post-incident drug 
and alcohol test  as he was directly involved in the recovery operation, but the procedure was 
not adhered to.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified by the 
Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission issuing a 
recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the re gulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that would 
not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 3 Nov ember 2016 , KiwiRail issued Special Bulletin  785, which  stated in part:  
Commencing forthwith and continuing until further advised the following 
instruction will operate;  
Trains stopping on the Mission Bush Branch between 0.00km (Paerata) and 
11.80km (Glenbrook) MUST NOT  setback/change direction.  
Note; this is an interim instruction until a review is completed.  
 This Special Bulletin is current.  
6.3. On 4 November 2016 , KiwiRail reduced the maximum number of loaded coal wagons permitted 
to be hauled by a single DL -class locomotive on the Mission Bush line from 22 wagons to 20.  
There have been no train stallings recorded on the Mission Bush line since the load schedule 
was reduced.   
6.4. On 11 April 2017 , KiwiRail confirmed that:  
 Mission Bush  line pilots had been issued with train control portable radio s to ensure  that 
they were  included in and aware of setback arrangements  
 comprehensive site inductions at Paerata for all Mission Bush  line staff undertaking  
piloting duties were  underway and due to b e completed by 30 June 2017  
 train performance trials had been completed to establish preferred driving techniques to 
reduce the likelihood of stalling.    
6.5. On 3 August 2017 , the NZ Transport Agency stated that it had required KiwiRail to develop a 
safety im provement plan to raise the standard of no -technical skills training to its 'at risk ' staff.   
The reason for the safety improvement plan requirement was that the NZ Transport Agency did 
not believe that KiwiRail was making sufficient effort to meet a remed ial action that was issued 
from a non -compliance  the lack of non -technical skills training discovered in the 2015 ordinary 
safety assessment.  
6.6. KiwiRail has agreed and presented the NZ Transport Agency with an integrated non -technical 
skills training and development plan for implementation by the end of 2018.

 Final Report RO -2016 -102 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to KiwiRail  with notice of these 
recommendations given to the NZ Transport Agency . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety , it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar acc idents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendation s to KiwiRail  
7.3. Neither the train controller,  nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with 
KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124 (d), which had replaced a withdrawn local procedure for s etting  
back  trains at Paerata.  When change is made within an organisation, it is important that it is 
effectively communicated and checks  are made to ensure it has been fully implemented.  
It is generally not sufficient to make a change, broadcast it by way of a Bulletin , and then 
assume that all staff will have read and fully understood what is required . This is  particular ly if it 
involves a change to a long -established procedure and one th at has implications for transport 
safety.  
On 24 August 2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review 
its change management processes to ensure  that changes in policies, procedures and rules are 
communicated effectively to sta ff and appropriate procedures are in place to measure 
compliance with the changes . (024/17)   
7.3.1.  On 13 September 2017, KiwiRail replied, in part:  
We confirm that KiwiRail will implement these recommendations.  
The proposed review will address the effectiveness of the current change 
management process in terms of ensuring required operating knowledge will 
effectively reach the appropriate individuals, and that assurance processes are 
established to ensure that any introduced changes are being fully complied with.  
7.4. The train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was directly involved in the 
incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post -incident drug and alcohol test.  
It will not always be immediately apparent whether a person 's actions or inactions have 
contributed to an occurrence.  It sometimes only becomes apparent after an investigation.  For 
this reason , managers should not be able to exercise discretion  about  whether their staff are 
asked to undergo testing.  All safety -critical staff involved in the circumstances of an accident or 
incident should be tested.  
On 24 August 2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive  of KiwiRail review 
its post -incident drug and alcohol policy to ensure  that all personne l directly involved in an 
accident and/or operating incident are aske d to submit to testing.  ( 025/17) 
7.4.1.  On 13 September 2017, KiwiRail replied, in part:

drug and alcohol te sting to ensure all personnel involved in an incident are 
requested to submit to testing.

 Notice given to the NZ Transport Agency  of the following recommendation s made to KiwiRail  
7.5. Neither the train controller,  nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with 
KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124 (d), which had replaced a withdrawn local procedure for setting  
back  trains at Paerata.  When change is made within an organisation, it is important that  it is 
effectively communicated and checks  are made to ensure  it has been fully implemented.  
It is generally not sufficient to make a change, broadcast it by way of a Bulletin , and then 
assume that all staff will have read and fully understood what is required . This is  particular ly if it 
involves a ch ange to a long -established procedure and one that has implications for transport 
safety.  
On 24 August 2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review 
its change management processes to ensure changes in policies, procedures and  rules are 
effectively communicated to staff and appropriate procedures are in place to measure 
compliance with the changes.  
7.6. The train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was directly involved in the 
incident, yet he was not asked to under go a post -incident drug and alcohol test.  
It will not always be immediately apparent whether a person 's actions or inactions have 
contributed to an occurrence.  It sometimes only becomes apparent after an investigation.  For 
this reason , managers should no t be able to exercise discretion about  whether their staff are 
asked to undergo testing.  All safety -critical staff involved in the circumstances of an accident or 
incident should be tested.  
On 24 August 2017 , the Commission recommended that the Chief Exec utive  of KiwiRail review 
its post -incident drug and alcohol policy to ensure  that all personnel directly involved in an 
accident and/or operating incident are asked to submit to testing.
