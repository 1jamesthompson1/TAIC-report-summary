- The setback movement was not planned and carried out in accordance with the operating rules and procedures.
- KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff the replacement of an old procedure for recovering stalled trains at Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 124 (d). Neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124 (d), which had replaced the withdrawn local procedure for setting trains back at Paerata.
- the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the procedure that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority.
- The train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test.
