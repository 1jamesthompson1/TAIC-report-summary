- name: Non-adherence to Operating Procedures
  explanation: Non-adherence to operating procedures is a safety theme that is highly relevant to this accident. The report indicates that the train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedure as described in Operating Rule 124(d) for undertaking the setback movement for the coal train, which was a contributing factor in the incident ("The train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedure as described in Operating Rule 124(d) for undertaking the setback movement for the coal train. His not doing so was a contributing factor in the incident" (5.3)). Additionally, the train controller, the train driver, and the pilot did not share the same concept of the plan for recovering the stalled train, leading to errors and erroneous assumptions that contributed to the incident ("Consequently, a number of errors and erroneous assumptions that contributed to the incident went unchallenged" (5.6)).
- name: Inadequate Communication and Training
  explanation: Inadequate communication and training is another safety theme related to this accident. The report highlights that neither the train controller, the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124(d), which had replaced the withdrawn local procedure for setting trains back at Paerata ("Neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot was sufficiently familiar with KiwiRail's Operating Rule 124(d)" (4.3.22)). This lack of familiarity suggests that the change in procedures was not effectively communicated or that staff were not adequately trained on the new rule, which is a safety issue because it involves a change to a long-established procedure with implications for transport safety ("It is generally not sufficient to make a change, broadcast it by way of a Bulletin, and then assume that all staff will have read and fully understood what is required" (4.3.23)).
- name: Deficient Risk Management
  explanation: Deficient risk management is a safety theme that emerges from the report, as it was found that the system of change management at KiwiRail was not effective in communicating to staff a change in procedures for setting back trains at Paerata and ensuring that the change was fully implemented ("The KiwiRail system of change management was not effective in communicating to staff a change in procedures for setting back trains at Paerata and ensuring that the change was fully implemented" (5.5)). This indicates a broader issue with how the organization manages and mitigates risks associated with procedural changes.
- name: Lack of Shared Understanding Among Crew
  explanation: A lack of shared understanding among the crew is a safety theme identified in the report. The train controller, train driver, and pilot did not have a shared understanding of the procedure that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority, which contributed to the incident ("the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the procedure that was to be followed and the limit for the setback authority" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). This lack of shared understanding led to miscommunication and incorrect assumptions during the recovery operation.
- name: Inadequate Post-Incident Procedures
  explanation: Inadequate post-incident procedures are highlighted as a safety theme in the report. Specifically, the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test as required by KiwiRail's procedures ("the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test" (4.5)). This omission suggests a failure to adhere to established post-incident protocols, which are designed to ensure safety and accountability.
- name: Insufficient Non-Technical Skills Training
  explanation: Insufficient non-technical skills training is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The report discusses the importance of non-technical skills, such as situational awareness, communication, and decision-making, for safe and efficient task performance in safety-critical roles ("The Rail Safety and Standards Board of Great Britain define non-technical skills as, 'the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance'" (4.4.1)). The lack of non-technical skills training for the train controller, train driver, and pilot may have contributed to the incident, as evidenced by the errors and miscommunications that occurred during the recovery operation.
