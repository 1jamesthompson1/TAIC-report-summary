  \ are commercial considerations for repeated train stallings on the Mission Bush\
  \  \nline, a train stalling does not compromise  safety provided there are good\
  \ , safe procedures to \neffect a recovery and those procedures are adhered to.\
  \  \n4.1.2.  The following analysis outlines  what happened  and then discusses\
  \ four safety issues that have \nimplications for rail safety : \n\uF0B7 the setback\
  \ movement  was not planned and carried out  in accordance with the operating \n\
  rules and procedures   \n\uF0B7 KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff\
  \ about the replac ement  of an old \nprocedure for recovering stalled t rains at\
  \ Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 124 (d) \n\uF0B7 the train controller\
  \ , the train driver  and the pilot  did not hav e a shared  understanding of \n\
  the limit for the setback authority , or of  the method for protecting the movement\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the train controller was performing a safety -critical role and was\
  \ directly involved in the \nincident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post -incident\
  \ drug and alcohol test . \n4.2. What happened  \nTrain stalling  \n4.2.1.  Trains\
  \ can stall for a number  of reasons : train overload ing; locomotive perform ance\
  \ ; driver \nskills ; and low-adhesion track  conditions.  Low -adhesion track \
  \ conditions are likely to occur \nwhen there is a combination of wet , windy weather\
  \ and leaf drop onto the railhead  \n(see Figure 6).  These conditions were present\
  \ on the morning of this occurrence.   \n \nFigure 6  \nOverhanging vegetation near\
  \ the 1 km  mark  \n4.2.2.  KiwiRail operate s three coal trains per weekday from\
  \ Rotowaro  to the Mission Bush Terminal.  \nEach  train consist s of a single DL\
  \ -class locomotive hauling 22 wagons.  T he tonnage hauled by \na single DL -class\
  \ locomotive from Paerata to Mission Bush  was restricted to a maximum  of \n1,520\
  \ tonnes .   \n\n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.2.3.  The declared\
  \ weight for the train was 1 ,470 tonnes, within 3% of the maximum  allowable \n\
  tonnage.  The train was made up of three separate classes of wagon, each class with\
  \ its own \ntare and maximum gross weight.  An average gross wagon weight had to\
  \ be used in the  \ncalculation of the train weight because there was no weighbridge\
  \ for the wagons to pass over \nbefore departing.  The actual gross wagon weight\
  \ could  vary due to the moisture level of the \ncoal and the height to which each\
  \ wagon was loaded , so the true train weight could not be \ndetermined accurately.\
  \  \n4.2.4.  There had been 33 reported train stallings on the Mission Bush line\
  \ between 12 April 2015 and \n25 October 2016, of which 26 had occurred within the\
  \ first 2 km  of the line .  Further analysis \nshowed that 23 of the 26 trains\
  \ that had stalled were the first train s of the day.  \n4.2.5.  KiwiRail reviewed\
  \ the event recorder downloads from a number of trains that had stalled on the \n\
  Mission Bush line.  A common theme was that drivers had been  maintaining notch\
  \ 8 (maximum \npower demand) for too long.  \n4.2.6.  Following trials on the Mission\
  \ Bush line in mid-2016, KiwiRail had developed and documented \nan optimum driving\
  \ method for the DL -class , locomotive -hauled coal trains  for best adhesion \n\
  control under poor rail -adhesion conditions.  This optimum driving method required\
  \ a driver to \nmake a b rake application when the train speed fell to 30 km/h,\
  \  then select a lower power \ndemand at predetermined speeds as the train slowed\
  \ further . \n4.2.7.  A copy of the optimum driving method had been  distributed\
  \ by local management on an \ninformal basis , without discuss ion and without conducting\
  \ a formal safety assessment . \n4.2.8.  The event recorder for the train involved\
  \ in this in cident  showed that the driver entered the Link \nRoad at the prescribed\
  \ 45 km/h , then generally followed the optimum  driving technique .  He \nmade\
  \ a brake application when the train speed dropped to 44 km/h  before reducing power\
  \ \ndemand as the train speed continued to fall.  \n4.2.9.  Driver technique is\
  \ therefore unlikely to have contributed to the stall.  I t was likely that the\
  \ train \nweight  exceeded the  capability of the locomotive in the track -adhesion\
  \  conditions.   \n4.2.10.  Following this incident KiwiRail reduced the maximum\
  \ number of wagons permitted to be \nhauled by a single DL -class locomotive on\
  \ the Mission Bush  line from 22 wagons to 20.  Since \nthen there have been no\
  \ further reports of train stallings  (see paragraph  6.3). \nTrain recovery  \n\
  4.2.11.  The train controller had three options for manag ing the recover y of the\
  \ train : \n\uF0B7 attach a n additional  locomotive to the head of the train  \n\
  \uF0B7 attach an additional  locomotive to the rear of the train  \n\uF0B7 authorise\
  \ the train to set  back along the Branch Main to the northbound line of the NIMT\
  \ , \nunder controlled conditions , before signalling its return on  the longer\
  \ and more gentle \ngradient on the Branch Main .  \n4.2.12.  There were  no other\
  \ locomotives available , so the train controller decided to  authoris e a train\
  \ \nsetback movement.  He knew that operating staff on duty at the Mission Bush\
  \  Terminal w ere \nappropriately qualified and that they had assisted drivers of\
  \ stalled trains many times before .   \n  \n \n \n \n  \nFinal Report RO -2016\
  \ -102 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.3. Procedure  for setting back at P aerata on the NIMT\
  \ towards Papakura  \nSafety issue - the setback movement was not planned and carried\
  \ out  in accordance with the \noperating rules and procedures . \n4.3.1.  On 7\
  \ February 2012 , KiwiRail  had issued Semi -Permanent Bulletin  69, which  deleted\
  \ the Local \nNetwork Instruction , Section L1.1, Clause 6.1.4, Setting back at\
  \ Paerata on the NIMT towards \nPapakura .  A KiwiRail risk assessment  had found\
  \ that this and numerous other local \ninstructions for setting back were adequately\
  \ covered by the current Operating Rule 124, \nPropelling of Vehicles on Main Line\
  \ . \n4.3.2.  Special Bulletin 624 , effective from 19 September 2012,  required\
  \ all rail personnel to a void \nwalking on rail bridge/ viaduct sleepers  and only\
  \ use dedicated walkways and footways .  With no \ndedicated footway fitted to Bridge\
  \ 2, local operational management had interpreted the Bulletin \nto mean rail personnel\
  \ were not to walk over this bridge and  field staff were instructed \naccordingly.\
  \  The pilot was position ed beside 11 points when the setback movement started\
  \ \nand from that location could not see the 'Stop ' indication displayed on Signal\
  \ 10R .   \n4.3.3.  Trains stalling before reaching the 2 km  mark on th e Mission\
  \ Bush  line was not uncommon.  \nMore than 30 trains had stalled on that section\
  \ of track in the 18 mont hs before this incident .  \n4.3.4.  Operating Rule 124\
  \ stated in part:  \n(a) A locomotive may propel a train or vehicle upon the main\
  \ line when:  \n(ii) a train is  stalled and has to set back  \n4.3.5.  The coal\
  \ wagons on the stalled train were not fitted with safe riding positions.  Under\
  \ such \nconditions setback movements are carried out in accordance with Operating\
  \ Rule 124(d)  that \nrequire s the train controller, the driver and the pilot to\
  \ carry out a number of checks before the \ntrain controller authoris es the setback\
  \ movement, including:  \n\uF0B7 all three confirming the access route to the feature\
  \ that require d protection with the pilot  \n\uF0B7 the train controller establishing\
  \ contact with the driver and pilot and agree ing the \nfeature/location to which\
  \ the movement would  set back (which could  be a level crossing, \npoints, signal,\
  \ metrage, board, structure, etc)  \n\uF0B7 the train controller advising the tr\
  \ ain driver  of the estimated setting back distance to the \nagreed feature/location.\
  \  \nIn this case, none of these checks was carried out before the movement authority\
  \ was issued.  \nFrom the train controller's perspective  \n4.3.6.  The train controller\
  \ issued the movement authority as shown in Appendix 1.  T he Safe Working  \nAuthority\
  \  form , in part, instructed the train driver to:  \n\uF0B7 set back  from 1.50\
  \ km on the Mission Bush  line in accordance wi th fixed signals to \nPaerata  \n\
  \uF0B7 call 'clear and complete of  block section '. \n4.3.7.  The train controller's\
  \ instruction . 'in accordance with fixed signals ' contained in the movement \n\
  authority , required that either the driver or the pilot sight all the signals ,\
  \ including Signal 10R .   \n4.3.8.  The train controller did not identify the feature\
  \ /location when he stated  the limit for the setback \nmovement.  'Paerata ' covered\
  \ a wide area and therefore could not be considered  a clearly \nidentif ied feature\
  \ or location for the purpose of this setback movement.   \n4.3.9.  The train controller\
  \ had already given priority to the northbound empty passenger train through \n\
  Paerata on the NIMT.  In doing so, the signalling system had prevented him placing\
  \ Signal 10R \nat 'proceed '. \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.3.10.\
  \  At that time the re were only two options available to the train controller \
  \ if the KiwiRail \nprocedures were to be followed.  The first was to set  back\
  \  the train to Signal 10R, being the only \nclearly distinguishable feature.  The\
  \ second was to wait for the passenger train to clear the \nsection so that  he\
  \ could change Signal 10R to green , at which time the train could  set back to\
  \ \nanother clearly distinguishable feature within the Paerata area.  \n4.3.11.\
  \  An analysis of the signal logs showed that the train controller did not block\
  \ any signals to \nprevent conflicting movements  before he issued the movement\
  \ authority , but he did so some \nfour minutes after the train passed Signal 10R\
  \ at stop and  two minutes after the train had \nstopped .  Instead he authorised\
  \ the passenger train to enter the section of the NIMT that the \ncoal train would\
  \ have occupied had the pilot not seen the red aspe ct on Signal 6R B.  It is a\
  \ \nconcern that the train controller told the driver that he had applied blocking\
  \ to the signals when \nhe had not.  \n4.3.12.  Had the train controller authorised\
  \  the limit of the setback authority a s Signal 10R, he would \nhave needed the\
  \ train driver to identify the precise location of the front of the stalled train\
  \  so he \ncould determine the distance of the intended setback movement .  However,\
  \ the distance from \nthe rear of the stalled train to Signal 10R was only 401 m\
  \ , so there was minimal  benefit in doing \nthis.  \n4.3.13.  Had the train controller\
  \ stepped through the required procedure, it is highly likely that he would \nhave\
  \ realised that waiting  until the passenger train had cleared Paerata would have\
  \ been the \nlogical choice.  Had h e done so, the incident would not have happened\
  \ .  Once the passenger \ntrain had passed , the train controller would have been\
  \ able to set Signals 10R and 6 RB to \n'proceed ', thereby enabling  the stalled\
  \ train to set  back in one continuous movement  past \nPaerata  Station entry board\
  \ number 1 (a clearly distinguishable feature ) on the northbound line \nof the\
  \ NIMT.  \n4.3.14.  Following the incident the train controller had difficulty recalling\
  \ the specific requirements of \nOperating Rule 124 (d) to the Commission investigators\
  \ .  The train controller had not undergone \nany special t raining in or assessment\
  \ on Operating Rule 124 (d) after the Automatic Signalling \nRegulations were introduced\
  \ . \nFrom  the train driver 's perspective  \n4.3.15.  Operating Rule 124(d) required\
  \ the train driver to carry o ut a number of actions , which  includ ed: \n\uF0B7\
  \ confirming the estimated distance to the feature/location with train control \
  \ \n\uF0B7 setting the head -end counter for the distance to the next agree d feature/location.\
  \  \n4.3.16.  The train driver and the train controller did not  agree  on a clearly\
  \ distinguis hable feature to \nwhich the setback movement would be  authorised.\
  \  As a consequence , the distance to that \nfeature was not provided by the train\
  \ controller , and the train driver could not  enter  a parameter  \ninto the locomotive\
  \ distance  counter . \n4.3.17.  The train driver was expecting  to have green signals\
  \ for the entire setback movement to Paerata \nfor two reasons.  The train controller\
  \ had told the driver that he  had applied blocking on  the \nsignals to prevent\
  \ any conflicting movements  and that h e was required to call 'train control '\
  \ \nwhen the train was clear and complete of the block section .  The driver  said\
  \ that this was the \nfirst time that he had made the setback movement  on the Mission\
  \ Bush line and he had been \ntold by other drivers that the setback movement never\
  \ started without first having authority to \npass Signal 10R.   \n4.3.18.  The\
  \ driver displayed limited knowledge of the requirements of Operating Rule 124 (d).\
  \  He had \nonly been driving for about 1 7 months at the time of the incident \
  \ and had not dr iven a train that \nhad stalled  before .   \n  \nFinal Report\
  \ RO -2016 -102 \n<< Page 13 >>\n From the pilot's perspective  \n4.3.19.  According\
  \ to the KiwiRail procedure , the pilot should have been issued with a radio capable\
  \ of \nworking on the train control frequencies.  However, t he pilot had been issued\
  \ with a hand -held \nradio only capable of receiving and transmi tting on the local\
  \ channel.  Consequently , he could \nnot listen to  the train controller issuing\
  \ the authori ty for the setback movement  over the 'open' \nradio channel  or have\
  \ radio communication with them .  The procedure as described in \nOperating Rule\
  \ 124(d) required the train controller, the driver and the pilot to agree on the\
  \ \nprocedure and the feature or location where the setback movement would terminate.\
  \   This non -\nadherence to the procedure resulted in a  lost opportunity for the\
  \ incident to be prevented \nthrough the intervention of the pilot.  \n4.3.20. \
  \ Like the train driver, the pilot had assumed that the signals would be clearly\
  \ displaying \n'proceed ' (green) for the entire setback movement.  This was the\
  \ first time  out of about 30 that \nhe had piloted such a movement when the the\
  \ setback train had been required to stop at Signal \n10R. \n4.3.21.  His knowledge\
  \ of Operating Rule 124(d) was limited , similar to the train controller and the\
  \ \ndriver .  His perception was that all signals  would be displaying green for\
  \ the entire setback \nmovement, which was a situation that he was  used to.  It\
  \ could not be established whether he \nhad been assessed for his knowledge of Operating\
  \ Rule 124 (d), as KiwiRail was unable to \nproduce the records of hi s most recent\
  \ assessments, which is a concern.  \nFrom KiwiRail's perspective  \nSafety issue\
  \ - KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff the replac ement  of an old\
  \ \nprocedure for recovering stalled trains at Paerata with the existing Operating\
  \ Rule 124 (d). \n4.3.22.  Neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor\
  \ the pilot was sufficiently familiar with \nKiwiRail's Operating Rule 124 (d),\
  \ which had replaced the withdrawn local procedure for setting \ntrains back at\
  \ Paerata.  When a change is made within an or ganisation, it is important that\
  \ it is \ncommunicated  effectively  and checks are made to ensure  it has been\
  \ fully implemented.  \n4.3.23.  It is generally not sufficient to make a change,\
  \ broadcast it by way of a Bulletin, and then \nassume that all staff will have\
  \ read and fully understood what is required . This is  particular ly if it \ninvolves\
  \ a change to a long -established procedure, and one that has implications for transport\
  \ \nsafety.  \n4.3.24.  This incident is an indication that KiwiRail's system for\
  \ change  management could benef it from \na review.  A recommendation has been\
  \ made to KiwiRail to address this issue.   Since this \nincident , KiwiRail has\
  \ revised its procedures to ensure  that pilots are equipped with radios \ncapable\
  \ of transmitting and receiving on the open train control fr equencies . \n4.3.25.\
  \  After  this incident, KiwiRail issued a Special  Bulletin on  3 November 2016\
  \ , stating in part:  \nTrains stopping on the Mission Bush Branch between 0.00\
  \ km (Paerata) and \n11.80km (Glenbrook) MUST NOT setback/change direction.  \n\
  Note; this is an interim instruction until a review is completed.  \nThis Special\
  \ Bulletin was still  curren t at the time this report was published . \n4.3.26.\
  \  The three safety actions taken by KiwiRail have effectively eliminated the risk\
  \ s posed by a train \nstalling and setting back on the Branch Main .  Reducing\
  \ the tonnage of the coal trains has \nreduced the frequency of trains stalling\
  \ on the Mission Bush line.  Prohibiting the setback \nprocedure at that location\
  \ has eliminated the hazards a ssociated with piloting trains at a \nlocation where\
  \ pilots have had difficulty positioning themselves where they can be  the 'eyes'\
  \ for \nthe train driver s.  Issuing  the pilots with radio s capable of receiving\
  \ and transmitting on the train \ncontrol frequencies will enhance communication\
  \ between pilots, train control lers and train \ndriver s in any operation s requiring\
  \ pilot s. \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2016 -102 4.4. Non-technical skills\
  \  \nSafety issue  - the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not\
  \ have  a shared \nunderstanding of the procedure  that was to be followed and the\
  \ limit for the setback authority .  \n4.4.1.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board\
  \ of Great Britain define non-technical skills as, 'the \ncognitive, social and\
  \ person al resource  skills that complement technical skills and contribute to\
  \ \nsafe and efficient task performance '.  While technical skills describe what\
  \ you need to do and \nknow for a given safety -critical task, non -technical skills\
  \ describe how you do that task. The non -\ntechnical skill components can be broken\
  \ down further to sub -categories that include \nsituational awareness, conscientiousness,\
  \ communication, decision -making and action, co -\noperati on and working with\
  \ others, workload management and self -mana gement.   \n4.4.2.  Analyses of incident\
  \ and accident reports within the rail industry conducted by the Rail Safety \n\
  and Standards Board showed that most  errors that occur red relate d to people at\
  \ the frontline \n(63%) , rather than management (30%) and design factors (7%).\
  \  Making mistakes is inevitable , \nbut the use of non -technical skills has been\
  \ shown to help mitigate and manage these errors.  \nFor example, Queensland Rail\
  \ reported that trainee drivers who did not complete non -technical \nskills training\
  \ were more than twice as like ly to pass a  signal at danger within their first\
  \ month \nthan  those who had received the training.  Similarly, Canadian Pacific\
  \ Railway reported a 46% \nreduction in human -caused incidents following non -technical\
  \ skills training.   \n4.4.3.  To carry out the train recov ery movement in a safe\
  \ manner  at Paerata , all participants were \nrequired to have a common understanding\
  \  and shared mental model  of all aspects of the \nsetback movement , but t his\
  \ was not the case.  \n4.4.4.  While the train driver was aware generally of the\
  \ recovery procedure, he had not previously  \nstalled a train at that location,\
  \ so  relied on the instructions given to him by the train controller . \n4.4.5.\
  \  The train controller was clear in his mind that he had authorised the setback\
  \ movemen t for the \ntrain to be carried out in accordance with fixed signals,\
  \ and that was initially only to Signal 10R .   \n4.4.6.  The train driver had recorded\
  \ on his movement authority that , 'Blocking has been applied to \nprevent conflicting\
  \ movements '.  This led him to believ e that he had been given  the authority to\
  \ \nset back to the northbound line of the NIMT.    \n4.4.7.  The train driver,\
  \ after advising the pilot that he held a valid setback authority and agree ing\
  \ on \nradio protocols, thought that the pilot was near  the rear of the train and\
  \ able to see all facing \nsignals.  In reality, n either of them was able to observe\
  \ the displayed aspect. However, the \ndriver had already discounted the possibility\
  \ that the train controller had placed Signal 10R at \n'Stop'.  \n4.4.8.  A review\
  \ of the train control voice recordings from the previous four train stallings on\
  \ the \nMission Bush line showed that the movement authorit ies had been to Station\
  \ Entry Board 1 on \nthe NIMT , as both the driver and the pilot were  expecting\
  \ on this occas ion.  It is essential that all \nparties are aware of, fully understand\
  \ and comply with operating procedures when undertaking \ntrain recovery movements.\
  \   \n4.4.9.  Although the train controller had been cer tified on the Waikato desk\
  \ for more than five years, he \nhad no t undertaken a site visit to the Paerata\
  \ triangle and surrounds.  He therefore had a \nlimited understanding of the environment\
  \ and challenges under which the field staff were \nworking during the setback movem\
  \ ent.  Had he been more aware, he may have waited u ntil the \nempty passenger\
  \ train had passed through Paerata before authorising the setback movement .  \n\
  4.4.10.  The Commission has raised the issue of non -technical skills training in\
  \ three recent rail \noccurrence reports that are ready for publication.  All these\
  \ reports include a reference to an \nopen recommendation made to the Chief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport Ag ency during 2012.  \nThe recommendation required the pra\
  \ ctice of non-technical skills to be recognised within the \nNational Rail System\
  \ Standards.  \n  \nFinal Report RO -2016 -102 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.4.11.  On 3 April\
  \ 2017 , the NZ Transport Agency stated that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail\
  \ on \nthis issue.  It added that it had issued a safety improvement plan notice\
  \ during December 2016 \nin accordance with section 36 of the Railways Act 2005\
  \ , requiring KiwiRail to prepare a safety \nimprovement plan to addres s the implementation\
  \ of non -technical skills in its stan dard rail \noperations.  \n4.4.12.  At the\
  \ time of publication the recommendation remains 'open' . \n4.5. Drug  and alcohol\
  \ testing  \nSafety issue - the train controller was performing a safety -critical\
  \ role and was directly involved \nin the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo\
  \ a post -incident drug and alcohol test.  \n4.5.1.  KiwiRail policy is that  staff\
  \ must  present for  work free from the influence of drugs  and/or \nalcohol, including\
  \ prescription and over -the-counter drugs.  KiwiRail conducts d rug and alcohol\
  \ \ntesting : pre-employme nt; when staff transfer from non -critical to safety\
  \ -critical roles ; following \naccidents and incidents;  for reasonable cause ;\
  \ and on a random  basis.  \n4.5.2.  KiwiRail requires al l personnel directly involved\
  \ in accident s or incident s to submit to drug and \nalcohol test procedure s.\
  \  Personnel are required to sign forms consenting to the tests.  T he \nalcohol\
  \ test is to be conducted within one hour of an occurrence and a urine sample collected\
  \ \nfor the drug test within three hours  of it. \n4.5.3.  In this case , the train\
  \ driver an d the pilot  were tested  and found to be clear .  However, the train\
  \ \ncontroller was not asked to submit to drug and alcohol testing, even though\
  \ he was directly \ninvolved in the incident  and was performing a safety -critical\
  \ role.  \n4.5.4.  It will not always be immedia tely apparent whether a person\
  \ 's actions or inactions have \ncontributed to an occurrence.  It sometimes only\
  \ becomes apparent during  an investigation.  For \nthis reason , manager s should\
  \ not be able to exercise discretion  about  whether their staff are \nasked to\
  \ submit to drug and alcohol testing .  All safety -critical staff involved in the\
  \ \ncircumstances of an accident or incident should be tested.  A recommendation\
  \ has been made \nto KiwiRail to address this issue .  \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
