- name: Compliance with Track Warrant Conditions
  explanation: 'Compliance with track warrant conditions is a critical safety theme in this accident. The track warrant control method of protection relies on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions ("Safety issue: The track warrant control method of protection was reliant on the addressee (the holder of the track warrant) complying with all instructions" (3.6)). In this incident, the track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed the specified location before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track, leading to the collision ("The track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed Limeworks Road public level crossing before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track and in the path of the approaching train" (4.4)).'
- name: Effective Use of Crew Resource Management
  explanation: Effective use of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles is another safety theme related to this accident. The train controller did not apply CRM principles effectively by not providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road ("When issuing the track warrant to the track ganger, the train controller did not apply Crew Resource Management principles by providing up-to-date information on the location of the next train approaching Limeworks Road" (4.3)). This lack of communication contributed to the track ganger's incorrect assumption about the train's location and subsequent unsafe actions.
- name: Verification of Train Movements
  explanation: Verification of train movements before authorizing track occupancy is a crucial safety theme. The track warrant system requires that certain conditions be met before a warrant becomes valid, such as verifying the passage of another train. In this case, the track ganger overlooked the requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the specified mark before the track warrant became valid ("The requirement to verify that Train 932 had passed the 429 km mark before the track warrant became valid was overlooked entirely" (3.21)). This oversight directly led to the hi-rail vehicle being on the track at the time of the collision.
- name: Adherence to Operating Rules and Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to operating rules and procedures is a safety theme that was not followed, contributing to the accident. The train controller issued the track warrant in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures, but the track ganger failed to adhere to these rules by not ensuring the departing train had cleared the area ("The train controller issued a track warrant to the track ganger conditional on the departure of Train 932 from Limeworks Road, in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures" (4.2)). This non-adherence to procedures resulted in the hi-rail vehicle being in the path of the oncoming train.
- name: Decision-Making in Emergency Situations
  explanation: Decision-making in emergency situations is a safety theme that played a role in the severity of the accident. The train driver chose to apply full-service braking instead of emergency braking, which would have reduced the train's speed more rapidly and possibly lessened the severity of the impact ("The train driver decided to make a full-service brake application rather than apply the emergency brakes, and as a result the train struck the hi-rail vehicle at a higher speed and took longer to stop than it would have had the emergency brake been applied" (4.5)). The driver's decision-making in this emergency situation affected the outcome of the accident.
- name: Technological Defenses Against Human Error
  explanation: The lack of technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The track warrant control system relies on compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms, and the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses ("however, the track warrant control system is reliant on the level of compliance by addressees with all the conditions written on track warrant forms and read back to train controllers. the issue and read-back process has no additional technological defenses to mitigate the risk of human error" (3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This reliance on human compliance without technological backup increases the risk of accidents due to human error, as seen in this incident.
