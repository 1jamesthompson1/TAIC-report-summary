  \  is used on lines carrying relatively low numbers of train \nmovements per day\
  \  to protect trains , equipment and personnel operating on the main  \nline (including\
  \ the main line within station limits ). This is achieved by train control \nissuing\
  \ written instructions (track warrant s) to 'addressees ', authorising the occupancy\
  \ \nof defined section s of track . Track warrants are numbered consecutively ,\
  \ from one, at \nthe start of each day.  \n3.2 Safe operations under tr ack warrant\
  \ control are achieved by permitting only one \nmovement to occupy  a defined section\
  \ of the main line at one time, except where the \nregulations make special provision\
  \ for shared occupancy.  No such special provisions \nwere in place at the time\
  \ of this accident.   \n3.3 Train controllers use TWACS12, a computer -based system,\
  \ to ensure that no conflicting \nwarrants are issued . However, the track warrant\
  \ control system is reliant on  the level of \ncompliance by addressees with  all\
  \ the conditions  written on  track warrant form s and \nread back to train controller\
  \ s. The issue and read -back process has no additional \ntechnological defences\
  \ to mitigate the risk of human error.   \n3.4 Although the likelihood of a collision\
  \ between a train and a hi -rail vehicle within track -\nwarrant -controlled territory\
  \ is low , the consequences can be severe . \n3.5 The following section analyses\
  \ the circumstances surrounding the event to identify \nthose factors that increased\
  \ the likelihood of the event occurring . It also examines the \nactivatio n of\
  \ the emergency train brake as  a non-contributory safety issue  that had the \n\
  potential to reduce the severity of the accident .  \nThe track warrant form  and\
  \ its clauses  \nSafety issue: The t rack warrant control method of protection \
  \ was reliant on the addressee ( the \nholder of the track warrant ) complying with\
  \ all  instructions .  \nThe train controller copy  of the track warrant  (Mis.\
  \ 87 form , see Figure 7) and the addressee's \ncopy (Mis . 88 form , see  \n3.6\
  \ Figure 8) are identical , except that the train controller's  copy has a space\
  \ to insert \ndetails of when and through whom a track warrant has been relaye d.\
  \ In this case, track \nwarrant 60 was issued  direct ly from the train controller\
  \ to the operator of  hi-rail vehicle \n36783 (its radio call sign).  See Appendix\
  \ 2  for track warrant 60 as recorded .  \n \n12 Track Warrant Assisted Computer\
  \ System. A computer -based system used by train controllers to prepare and \nissue\
  \ track warrants safely. It does so by checking against previous prepares, issues\
  \ and cancellations to ensure \nthat conflicts do no t exist.  \n \nFinal Report\

  \ warrant 60 was issued on Friday 24 April to the driver of hi-rail vehicle 36783\
  \ at \n429.00 km Main South l ine. \n3.9 Clause 1 is used only when it is necessary\
  \ to alter the instructions  contained in a track \nwarrant  before the limits of\
  \ that warra nt have been cleared.  \n3.10 Clause 2 is used when a movement is authorised\
  \ behind a departing train or when a \nmovement must not take place until an incoming\
  \ movement has arrived.  In either case \nthe relevant phrase \"after departure/\
  \ arrival of \u2026 from/at \" must be completed . \n3.11 Clause 4 is used for work\
  \ or for a movement that may need to work in either direction \nwithin the limits\
  \ of the warrant . Clause 4 can also be used with c lause 2 to allow for a \nmovement\
  \ to take place after the arrival of an opposing train.  \n3.12 Either clause 6\
  \ or clause 7 must be used on every track warrant  issued . Clause 7 must \nbe used\
  \ when the last  occupancy of all the area covered by the track warrant was by \n\
  the movement referred to in clause 2.   \n3.13 Clause 8 must be used whenever clause\
  \ 2 (after arrival/departure) is used on a track \nwarrant for an addressee . \n\
  3.14 Clause 12 (other instructions) must be used when it is necessary to include\
  \ additional \ninstructions not provided for in clauses 1 to 11.  These include\
  \ details  that provide  safe \nworking , such as the \"at location\" of the addressee.\
  \  \n3.15 The KiwiRail Rail Operating Rules , issue 7, effective from 6 October\
  \ 2019 , section 4, \ntrack warrant control rule 402 , state d in part:  \n3. Conditional\
  \ -  All cases  \n \nA track warrant which specifies that a movement or work  is\
  \ authorised \"after\"  a \nmovement, may only be issued  when:  \n\u2022 the addressee\
  \ is at the location at which the train is to arrive at or depart \nfrom, \n\u2022\
  \ the movement after which the movement is to take place has bee n \nauthorised\
  \ to proceed in one direction only, and  \n\u2022 is due at that location within\
  \ the next 15 minutes.  \n5. Conditional  - After departure of   \nWhen the movement\
  \ is to be carried out after the depa rture of a train , the addressee must \nensure\
  \ that the departing train  has cleared the area far enough for the movement or\
  \ work \nto be safely performed.  \n \n3.16 The KiwiRail Rail Operating Procedures,\
  \ section 10.1  - Operating Instructions for Train \nControl , clause 13.8.8  [Rule\
  \ 402 (c)] that provided instructions  to train controllers stated \nin part : NOTE:\
  \  It is not possible for a train to be issued with a track warrant conditional\
  \ upon \nthe arrival or departure of a Hi -Rail Vehicle or MTMV [Motor Trolley Maintenance\
  \ \nVehicle].  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020- 102 \n<< Page 12 >>\n \n The purpose\
  \ of this \"after \" provision is to save time by giving Train Control the \nopportunity\
  \ of issuing a track warrant while the movement is waiting for an opposing train\
  \ \nor the track warrant for that train is still in effect.  However the issue of\
  \ such track warrants \ntoo far in a dvance of the arriving  or departing train\
  \ should be avoided and generally \nshould not be more than 15 minutes in advance\
  \ . \nA train which is to arrive or depart before the movement for which a track\
  \ warrant is being \nissued takes place, must be the next train at the time of issue.\
  \  \n3.17 Clause 13.8.9 [Rule 402(d) and (e)] of th ese same  operating instructions\
  \ also stated in \npart: \nClause 8 is used to reinforce the requirement for the\
  \ track warrant addressee to  check and \nensure the previous movement has cleared\
  \ the \"at\"  location . \nTrain Control must apply Crew Resource Management[13]\
  \ principles to provide train \nlocation information by use of T rain Control radio\
  \ call to the train if necessary and/or use \nof GPS position reporting.   \n3.18\
  \ The train controller issued track warrant 60 to the driver of hi -rail vehicle\
  \ 36783 in an \naccurate manner , except for at first  stating in clause 2, \"after\
  \ the departure of Train \n924\".  During the COVID -19 Alert L evel 4 lockdown,\
  \ KiwiRail ran  a reduced freight \nschedule and the usual Train 924 was assigned\
  \ a revised train number and operated as  \nTrain 932.  The train controller  recogn\
  \ ised and  corrected this error immediately , before \nmoving to the next clause\
  \ confirming  the work -between locations as  Henley and \nBenhar shown in clause\
  \ 4.  \n3.19 When track warrant 60 was issued  at 1501 , conditional on the departure\
  \ of northbound \nfreight Train 932  from  429 k m (the Limew orks Road public level\
  \ crossing) , the next \ntrain scheduled to pass over that location was  southbound\
  \ freight Train 937 . Train 937 \nwas expected to reach Limeworks Road public level\
  \ crossing at about 1740, some  150 \nminutes lat er.  \n3.20 The workload for the\
  \ train controller at th at time was not excessive, with only two \nother  active\
  \ train movements  for the area they were managing . It took the train \ncontroller\
  \ three minutes to complete the issuing of track warra nt 60.  Therefore, when \n\
  combined with a low  level of rail activity in the area , there were  minimal operational\
  \ \nbenefits  from the train controller issuing  a conditional track warrant to\
  \ the hi -rail \nvehicle operator before the train had passed the 429 km mark .\
  \ Once  the track warrant \nwas issued , the responsibility for the safe operation\
  \ rested solely with the addressee to \nfollow all the instructions  in order to\
  \ achieve a safe outcome. Placing that responsibility \non an addr essee, rather\
  \ than a train controller who has more up -to-date information \navailable regarding\
  \ the location s of trains , can set up a situation for potential  human \nerror.\
  \  \n3.21 The track  ganger  stated during interview that he believed Train 932\
  \ had already passed \nthe 42 9 km  mark  at the time the track warrant was read\
  \ back correctly at 1501 , but \ncould offer  no factual evidence as to why  he\
  \ thought that was the case . The \nrequirement to verify that Train 932 had passed\
  \ the 429 km mark before the track \nwarrant became valid was overlooked  entirely\
  \ . The track ganger had not considered \nthe broader issue  as to why the train\
  \ controller  had issue d a conditional track warrant \nwhen the train had passed\
  \ their  location already . The track ganger  had a device \n \n13 KiwiRail's frame\
  \ work for non -technical skills  including situational awareness, conscientiousness,\
  \ \ncommunication, decision -making and action, co -operation and working with others,\
  \ workload management \nand self -management.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020- 102 \n\
  << Page 13 >>\n \n available with a software program known as GeVis . This program\
  \ enables the user to \nsee the approximate location s of all trains on the network.\
  \  Had the track ganger  \nchecked the device immediately after taking the track\
  \ warrant , the train would have \nbeen shown as still on approach to 429 km.  \
  \ \n3.22 In not providing train location information to the track ganger, the train\
  \ controller did \nnot apply Crew Resource Management principles effectively . Had\
  \ the train controller \nstated Train 932  was near Milton , it would have been\
  \ a further cue to the track ganger  \nto wait trackside until the train had passed\
  \ .  \n3.23 Issuing track warrants to infrastructure staff , hi-rail vehicle s and\
  \ trolley users  that are \nconditional on the departure of trains from an \" at\
  \ location \" presents a r isk to th ese \ngroups if  they do not adhere to a warrant\
  \ 's conditions . KiwiRail took immediate action  \nin response to this incident\
  \  by publishing  a special bulletin to suspend the issue of \nclause 2  (i.e. conditional)\
  \  track warrants to these groups . This has since been followed  \nby a semi- permanent\
  \ bulletin with this same restriction on clause 2 warrants  (refer \nsection  5).\
  \ The Commission welcome this safety action and consider it to have \naddresse d\
  \ the issue identified.  \nNon-contributory factor : the emergency train brake \
  \ \n3.24 The train driver  controlled  the train on the approach to Limeworks Road\
  \ public level \ncrossing (429 km) in accordance with  the Driver Advisory System\
  \ 's14 recommended \nspeed . It was not until the train was about  200 metres  from\
  \ the level crossing that the \ndriver realised the hi -rail vehicle was in the\
  \ train's collision path. The train driver then \napplied the automatic train brake\
  \ to full-service  braking , and in doing so reduc ed the \ntrain speed from 57\
  \ to 44 kilometres -per-hour at impact .  \n3.25 The train driver expressed  concern\
  \ about using emergency braking due to the \npossibility of locking the wheels ,\
  \ which  could damage the running  surfaces of the \nwheels. However, by using emergency\
  \ braking there is less chance of wheels locking \nup due to locomotive s applying\
  \ sand  to the rail head automatically .  \n3.26 The use of the emergency brake\
  \ does not increase train braking force when compared \nto a full- service brake\
  \ application. However , by full venting  of brake pipe air pressure  - \nrather\
  \ than its  controlled  reduction  - emergency brak ing applies  this braking force\
  \ \nmore rapidly  than full -service brak ing. This reduced  delay in braking for\
  \ ce build -up \ntime subsequently reduces the stopping distance.   \n3.27 During\
  \ an emergency brake application s and is  automatically  applied to the rail head\
  \  to \nimprove  wheel -rail adhesion, and the locomotive  sends an emergency radio\
  \ call to \ntrain control once the brake pipe pressure falls below 200 kilopascals.\
  \  Usually  this \noccurs  after about 20 seconds  but varies with the type(s) of\
  \ wagons being hauled  and \nincreases with train length.  \n3.28 A post-accident\
  \ train simulation was carried out at KiwiRail's training centre  using the \nsame\
  \ train profile, track alignment , and gradient profile  to determine the operational\
  \ \nbenefits of making an emergency brake application. A train consist of 2  DX-class\
  \ \n \n14 A computer touch -screen mounted in the locomotive cab that is connected\
  \ to the locomotive power supply, \nglobal positioning system and cellular antennae\
  \ and provides a visual output of topographical and network \ndata along with suggested\
  \ speeds and operating modes.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020- 102 \n<< Page 14 >>\n\
  \ \n locomotives  and 32 wagons , with a total mass of 1865 tonnes and length of\
  \ 559 \nmetres , was loaded into the simulator . \n3.29 In summary , the first simulat\
  \ ion run was with a full -service brake application and \nindependent brake applied\
  \ at the same train speed and distance from Limeworks Road  \npublic level crossing.\
  \  The output from th is simulat ion run was consistent with the \ndownload data\
  \ from the Train 932 's event recorder , in that the impact speed showed a \nvariation\
  \ of 1 kilometre -per-hour  and the stopping distance was within 1 metre of the\
  \ \nactual (34 1 versus  340metres ). \n3.30 The second simulation run was carried\
  \ out using the emergency  brake . This output \ndata showed the loaded train would\
  \ have stopped 258 metres  from where  the \nemergency brake application was made.\
  \  This was a  reduction of  83 metres in stopping \ndistance when compared w ith\
  \ the full- service and independent braking  simulation \ndescribed above. Correspondingly,\
  \ the train speed at impact was lowered  28 \nkilometre s-per-hour  when using the\
  \ emergency brake.  \n3.31 While the application of the emergency brake would not\
  \ have prevented the collision , \nthe impact speed would have been lowered significantly\
  \ , and as a result the  impact \ndamage  to both the hi -rail vehicle and  the\
  \ locomotive  would have been less severe .  \n \nFinal Report RO -2020- 102 \n\
