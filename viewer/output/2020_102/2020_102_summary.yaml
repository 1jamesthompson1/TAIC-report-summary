- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The accident was significantly influenced by human error and assumptions. The track ganger assumed that Train 932 had already passed the 429 km mark without verifying this fact, which led to the hi-rail vehicle being placed on the track in the path of the approaching train (3.21). Additionally, the train controller issued a track warrant without effectively applying Crew Resource Management principles, failing to provide up-to-date information on the location of the next train (3.22, 3.23). These errors and assumptions directly contributed to the unsafe conditions that resulted in the accident.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The adherence to safety procedures was a critical factor in the accident. The track warrant control method relied on the addressee complying with all instructions (3.5). The track ganger did not verify the passing of Train 932, which was a condition of the track warrant, leading to the hi-rail vehicle being placed on the track prematurely (3.21). This lack of adherence to the safety procedures was a direct contributor to the accident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Crew Resource Management (CRM) was not effectively applied by the train controller when issuing the track warrant, as they did not provide the track ganger with up-to-date information on the location of the next train (3.22). The train controller's failure to use CRM principles effectively contributed to the track ganger's incorrect assumption about the train's location, which was a factor in the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While the document does not explicitly state that there was a lack of training or competency, the fact that the track ganger did not verify the train's location suggests a potential gap in understanding or applying the procedures correctly (3.21). This indicates that training and competency may have played a role in the accident.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The track ganger's situational awareness was compromised as they did not verify the actual location of Train 932, despite having the means to do so with the GeVis software program (3.21). This lack of situational awareness was a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There was a communication breakdown between the train controller and the track ganger. The train controller did not effectively communicate the location of Train 932, which could have prompted the track ganger to verify the train's location before proceeding (3.22). This breakdown in communication contributed to the unsafe conditions.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The train controller issued the track warrant in accordance with KiwiRail's operating rules and procedures (4.2). However, the train controller's failure to provide location information as part of CRM principles (3.22) suggests a potential issue with compliance to the full extent of the procedures, which may have contributed to the accident.
