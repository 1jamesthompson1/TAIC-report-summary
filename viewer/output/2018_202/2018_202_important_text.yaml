  \ a serious event.  Ships are necessarily designed with a number \nof high -fire-hazard\
  \ machinery and electrical installations in close proximity to \naccommodation and\
  \ cargo spaces, each with its own fire risk.  These fire risks are \nmanaged through:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 fire-resistant design and construction  \n\uF0B7 fire-detection  and\
  \ warning systems  \n\uF0B7 firefighting appliances and systems  \n\uF0B7 firefighting\
  \ procedures.  \n3.2. In this case the fire occurred while the ship was in port,\
  \ where shore -based firefighting \nresources were av ailable11.  However, because\
  \ ships spend the majority of  their time at \nsea, remote from shore assistance,\
  \ ship firefighting systems are designed around self -\nsufficiency when it comes\
  \ to managing the risk s and consequences of fire.  \n3.3. The following analysis\
  \ con siders each of these aspects in relation to the fire on board the \nDong Won\
  \ 701, and discusses two safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 some aspects of the crew response\
  \ to the fire did not meet industry good practice  \n\uF0B7 safety issues identified\
  \ included that inconsistencies in the  application of Maritime \nRules Part 40D:\
  \ Design, Construction and Equipment - Fishing Ships  may have \nresulted in up\
  \ to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not \ncomplying  fully\
  \ with the relevant safety standards . A further 50 fishing vess els have \nbeen\
  \ afforded grandparent rights 12 that will allow them  to operate indefinitely \
  \ \nwithout meeting contemporary safety standards  under the current Maritime Rules.\
  \  \nCause of the fire  \n3.4. Due to the intensity and duration of the fire and\
  \ the consequent damage to the \naccommodation structure, it was not possible to\
  \ determine conclusively the cause of the \nfire. \n3.5. Based on the observed burn\
  \ patterns and the nature of the damage that occurred, the \narea of origin was\
  \ determined to be the first engineer's cabin o n the officers' deck.  This \nhypothes\
  \ is is supported by witness accounts, particularly those of the engine room \n\
  rating who first discovered the fire, and the crew member on the deck below, who\
  \ was \nable to confirm that initially there was no fire in the cabi n directly\
  \ below the first \nengineer's cabin, or anywhere else on that deck.  \n3.6. Figure\
  \ 11 shows a plan of the first engineer's cabin, reconstructed from the ship's plans\
  \ \nand according to interviews with crew.  It shows multiple potential sources\
  \ of ignition, \nmainly electrical sources.  \n                                \

  \ be at or just above the floor level beside the \nrubbish bin, next to the first\
  \ officer's desk. The burn patterns on the ceiling and the \nwarping of the steel\
  \ plate where the cabin bulkheads13 were fastened support ed this \nconclusion,\
  \ as did the accounts of those who entered the cabin during the initial \nfirefighting\
  \ effort.  \n \n \nFigure 11: Plan layout drawing of first engineer's cabin  \n\
  Fire detection and alarm  \n3.8. The Dong Won 701 was fitted with an automatic fire\
  \ -alarm and fire -detection system for \nthe accommodation spaces.  The system\
  \ had been installed on board between 2015 and \n2016.  \n3.9. Each cabin was fitted\
  \ with a photoelectric -type smoke detector connected to a fire alarm \npane l installed\
  \ on the bridge.  The smoke detector sen t a signal to the fire alarm panel \nwhen\
  \ smoke was detected.  The fire alarm panel display ed the location of the fire\
  \ and \nautomatically trigger ed a general alarm throughout the ship.  \n3.10. Smoke\
  \ detectors of the t ype installed in the cabins could  detect smoke at an early\
  \ stage, \neven before it bec ame obviously visible.  \n3.11. The e arly detection\
  \ of fire is critical to the safety of ship and crew.  Early detection allows \n\
  crew to respond immediately and extinguish the fire b y direct attack before it\
  \ escalates \nbeyond control.  \n                                              \
  \          \n13 Vertical partitions in a vessel that divide the interior into compartments.\
  \  \n\nFinal Report MO -2018 -202 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 3.12. During this fire the fire\
  \ -detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general \nalarm.  Due to\
  \ the damage caused by the severity and duration of the fire, it was not \npossible\
  \ to determine why it d id not function automatically.  \n3.13. Fire-detection \
  \ and alarm systems are critical systems that would normally be routinely \ntested\
  \ in accordance with manufacturers' instructions.  As the on -board maintenance\
  \ \nrecords were destroyed in the fire, it was not possibl e to check these for\
  \ compliance with \nsuch instructions.  \n3.14. The crew responsible for testing\
  \ the fire alarm system explained that the fire alarms were \n\"tested \", but they\
  \ were unable to describe anything that resembled a routine regime for \nchecking\
  \ that all com ponents of the fire alarm system were functional.  \n3.15. Possible\
  \ reasons for the system not activating include:  \n\uF0B7 a fault with the smoke\
  \ detector in the cabin  \n\uF0B7 an interruption in power supply to the system\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the system being left in manual mode . \n3.16. An interruption in power\
  \ supply was unlikely, as the system ha d a dual power supply to it \nand there\
  \ had been  no reported power supply issues prior to the fire.  A fault with a \n\
  single detector was also unlikely, as other detectors should have activated the\
  \ alarm as \nthe smoke spread to other areas ; this did not happen.  \n3.17. The\
  \ system having been left in manual test mode could not be ruled out  as the crew\
  \ \nregularly left the alarm system in manual mode to avoid nuisance alarms triggered\
  \ by \nexhaust fumes, hot work e tc. The manual mode is not designed to be used\
  \ as the \nprimary operation mode. In manual mode the audible fire alarm could only\
  \ be heard on \nthe bridge and required the officer on watch to investigate and\
  \ raise a general alarm if \nnecessary.   \n3.18. Regardless of w hy the system\
  \ did not activate automatically, there were manual push -\nbutton alarms located\
  \ on every deck  that would have bypassed the automation and \nactivated the fire\
  \ alarm throughout the ship.  Pushing one of these buttons would have \nbeen the\
  \ best method  of raising the alarm for everyone on board.  None of the crew \n\
  pushed a manual button.  \nFirefighting procedures and equipment  \nSafety issue:\
  \ Some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not follow industry good practice.\
  \  \n3.19. Containing and extinguishing a fire quickly and effectively is critical\
  \ for preserving life \nand property.  Once the initial individual direct attacks\
  \ on the fire prove unsuccessful, the \nresponse would normally focus on containing\
  \ the fire and using all ava ilable resources to \nextinguish it.  \n3.20. The crew\
  \ of the Dong Won 701  had all received approved shore -based firefighting \ntraining.\
  \  They were all required to be current with the vessel's firefighting procedures.\
  \  \nThis would normally have been achieved during th e crew induction on board\
  \ and fire \nand emergency drills, which according to the operator's (DW New Zealand\
  \ Limited 's) \nmaritime transport operator plan14 were scheduled to happen four\
  \ times each year.  \n                                                        \n\
  14 A maritime operator's written description of their safety system; this is a requirement\
  \ under Maritime \nRules.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -202 3.21.\
  \ DWNZ had different checklists for responding to a fire wh en out at sea and when\
  \ \nalongside. When out at sea, t he Dong Won 701 's Emergency Checklist for Fire/Explosion\
  \ \nrequired the crew to take a number of actions on discovering a fire.  The checklist\
  \ was \nbroadly compliant with industry good practice.  However, there was no mention\
  \ of \nholding a crew muster to account for everyone on board. DWNZ's Vessel Emergency\
  \ \nAlongside checklist required the crew to evacuate the vessel and muster at an\
  \ \nunspecified must er station. However, the crew did not evacuate the vessel until\
  \ ordered \nto do so by FENZ, and the master was unable to confirm that all his\
  \ crew were safely off \nthe vessel. Emergencies that occur in port are problematic\
  \ in that regard, because not all \ncrew will necessarily be on board.  In this\
  \ case only nine of the 44 crew members were on \nboard to initially contain and\
  \ fight the fire.  Several important procedures were not \nfollowed, of which some\
  \ were  likely attributable to so few crew being available to \nrespond.  \n3.22.\
  \ An important aspect of containing a fire is to deprive it of oxygen.  The s tandard\
  \ \nprocedure for achieving this is to close all doors and openings to the space\
  \ where the \nfire is located.  After the retreat from the initial attempts to make\
  \ a direct  attack on the \nfire, the cabin door was left open - so too was the\
  \ door leading from the passageway to \nthe open deck.  Also, the ventilation flaps\
  \ supplying fresh air to the accommodation were \nleft open.  \n3.23. With a free\
  \ flow of oxygen to the fire, it quickly s pread from the first engineer's cabin\
  \ to \nengulf the accommodation spaces within a matter of minutes.  \n3.24. The\
  \ master's designated position in an emergency was on the bridge.  However, by the\
  \ \ntime he was alerted to the fire the bridge was rapidly becoming engulf ed in\
  \ fire.  \nConsequently the master was unable to use the communication equipment\
  \ to summon \nhelp.  \n3.25. The master went to the open deck aft15 of the bridge\
  \ , where a number of crew had \nmustered and attempted to organise a full muster\
  \ and form teams to fight the fire.  \nHowever, several crew  members took their\
  \ own course s of action, with some proceeding \nto the engine room to manage the\
  \ ammonia risk and others re -entering the \naccommodation space to continue attacking\
  \ the fire on an individual basis.  \n3.26. This unco ordinat ed response to the\
  \ fire continued until FENZ arrived and took command \nof the scene, having been\
  \ called by a member of the public.  \n3.27. Some crew members attempted to initiate\
  \ firefighting by preparing fire hoses on the \nport and starboard side s of the\
  \ upper deck .  However, they were unable to work the \nportable emergency fire\
  \ pump to pressurise the fire hoses.  \n3.28. In summary, the delay in all crew\
  \ being alerted to the fire was a missed opportunity to \nextinguish it using portable\
  \ firefighting equipment before it escala ted out of control.  \nThen, because the\
  \ immediate and surrounding areas were not shut down, the fire was \nable to spread\
  \ rapidly throughout the accommodation space before an effective \nfirefighting\
  \ effort could be mustered.  \nFire-resistant design and construct ion \nSafety\

  \ dparent rights that will allow them \nto operate indefinitely without meeting\
  \ contemporary safety standards under the current \nMaritime Rules.  \n3.29. Fishing\
  \ ships entered into the Fishing Vessel Register under the Fisheries Act 1996 (the\
  \ \nFisheries Act) are required  to meet applicable design , construction and equipment\
  \ rules \nin Rule 40D.  Rule 40D prescribes the minimum requirements for the design,\
  \ construction \nand equipment of New Zealand fishing ships, which include standards\
  \ for structural fire \nprotection.  Rule 4 0D came into force in 2000.  \n3.30.\
  \ The application of some parts of Rule 40D depends on the date when a ship was\
  \ \nconstructed or 'converted to' a fishing ship.  Rule 40D states that fishing\
  \ ships \nconstructed before 27 May 2004 (pre -2004 ships) are not required to meet\
  \ some \nstandards of design , construction and equipment contained in Rule 40D.\
  \  Fishing ships \nconstructed after 27 May 2004 (post -2004 ships) are required\
  \ to meet all of Rule 40D.  \n3.31. Under the Fisheries Act, either a New Zealand\
  \ -registered fishing ship or a  foreign -\nregistered fishing ship issued with\
  \ an exemption under section 103A(1) of the Fisheries \nAct c an apply to be registered\
  \ in the Fishing Vessel Register.  In around 2016 changes to \nthe Fisheries Act\
  \ meant that all foreign -registered fishing ships had to be registered as \nNew\
  \ Zealand fishing ships to remain on the Fishing Vessel Register.  \n3.32. Around\
  \ that period the owners of many foreign -registered fishing ships began \nregistering\
  \ them as New Zealand fishing ships.  For each ship this meant determining \nwheth\
  \ er it was  a pre -2004 ship or a post-2004 ship for the purposes of Rule 40D,\
  \ and \nthere was some inconsistency among surveyors in how this was done.  \n3.33.\
  \ In 2017 Maritime New Zealand discussed its interpretation of pre - and post -2004\
  \ vessels \nwith surveyors.  Maritime New Zealand's view was  that vessels constructed\
  \ outside New \nZealand that had been  first entered into the Fishing Vessel Register\
  \ in New Zealand after \n27 May 2004 were considered post -2004 vessels, and therefore\
  \ were required to meet all \nthe applic able standards of Rule 40D.  \n3.34. The\
  \ Dong Won 701  had been  constructed in Japan in 1971 and registered in South \n\
  Korea .16  In 2000  the Dong Wong 701  had been  entered into the Fishing Vessel\
  \ Register \nas an exempt ship, and entered into the New Zealand safe ship ma nagement\
  \ system.  As \nit had been  both constructed and entered  in the New Zealand system\
  \ prior to 2004, it \nwas considered to be a pre -2004 ship, and as such was 'grandparent\
  \ ed' and deemed \ncompliant with Rule 40D.  \n3.35. 'Grandparent  rights' is a\
  \ common regulatory tool used internationally in recognition of \nthe difficulty\
  \ in applying modern shipbuilding safety standards to old shipbuilding \ntechniques,\
  \ where often the cost of meeting new standards outweighs the benefits.  \n3.36.\
  \ An adverse effect of applying grandparent  rights to older standards is that the\
  \ crews are \nnot afforded the same level of safety  as, and therefore are more\
  \ at risk than those on  \nnewer vessels constructed to newer standards.  \n3.37.\
  \ For example, the corridor bulkheads in the accommodation spaces of a new ship\
  \ m ust be \nconstructed of non -combustible material.  The standard stairwells\
  \ on newer ships are \n                                                        \n\
  16 In 2016 the Dong Won 701  changed its registry to New Zealand.  \n \n\n<< Page\
  \ 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -202 required to have B -class17 self-closing door\
  \ s at one end to slow the spread of fire \nbetween decks.  \n3.38. The internal\
  \ corridor bulkheads and cabin doors on the Dong Won 70 1 were of \nhardboard or\
  \ similar wood -product construction and suffered complete combustion in \nthe fire.\
  \ The stairwells on the Don won 701  had no doors fitted between decks.  \nConsequently\
  \ the fire spread rapidly to the decks above.  \n3.39. It is highly likely that\
  \ a similar fire on board the Dong Won 701  while at sea, with more \ncrew and no\
  \ ability to step ashore, would have had more severe consequences.  This \nmade\
  \ it all the more important that fire-detection  systems were  working and that\
  \ th e fire \nresponse was fast and effective with all firefighting equipment working\
  \ properly.  \n3.40. Given the health and safety implications for crew working on\
  \ older grandparent ed \nfishing vessels, the Commission sought information from\
  \ Maritime New Zealand  about \nthe status of the New Zealand fleet.  This revealed\
  \ potential inconsistencies in the \napplication of Rule 40D. This was because it\
  \ was not clear from the rule that ships \nentering the system after 2004 should\
  \ have been made to comply  fully with Rule 40D, \nuntil Maritime New Zealand issued\
  \ its guidance to surveyors in 2017.  Consequently, \nprior to 2017, operators and\
  \ surveyors were applying Rule 40D inconsistently.  \n3.41. As of June 2018 there\
  \ were 63 active commercial fishing vessels , over 24 metres in \nlength,  register\
  \ ed in New Zealand. Of the 63  fishing vessels , 60 had been  constructed or \n\
  registered outside New Zealand.  \n3.42. Of these, 50 had been  first entered into\
  \ the Fishing Ship Register prior to 27 May 2004 \nand were therefore surveyed as\
  \ pre -2004 ships , in accordance w ith Rule 40D.  \n3.43. The remaining 13 commercial\
  \ fishing vessels had been  entered into the Fishing Ship \nRegister after 27 May\
  \ 2004.  Twelve of these vessels had been  constructed at various \ndates before\
  \ 2004 and as such, according to the Maritime New Zealand guidance issued \nin 2017,\
  \ should have been surveyed as post -2004 vessels and fully compl ied with the \n\
  standards in Rule 40D . \n3.44. Maritime New Zealand was unable to estab lish from\
  \ records whether these remaining 12 \nfishing vessels were correctly surveyed as\
  \ post -2004 vessels.  \n3.45. It is likely that some of these fishing vessels are\
  \ not fully meeting the applicable design , \nconstruction and equipment standards\
  \ prescribed in Rule 40D, depending on their year \nof construction and the applicable\
  \ foreign rules  according  to which they were built.  In \nsome respects they are\
  \ no different from the other 50 vessels that were afforded \ngrandparent  rights\
  \ prior to 2004.  As with the 12 post -2004 fishing vessels, the safety \nstandards\
  \ will vary depending on their year of construction and the applicable foreign \n\
  rules  according  to which they were built.  \n3.46. All grandparented fishing vessels\
  \ can remain in the system indefinitely, because there \nwas no ti me limit placed\
  \ on the grandparent  rights.  \n3.47. A useful variation to the grandparent  rights\
  \ in future would be to put a cap on the year \nof construction applicable to the\
  \ rule to prevent very old vessels entering the system \nand/or limit the number\
  \ of years a ve ssel is allowed to operate before it is either \nupgraded to meet\
  \ modern standards or withdrawn from the system.  Otherwise, there is \na risk that\
  \ over time the average age of fishing vessels in the New Zealand Fishing Vessel\
  \ \n                                                        \n17 Bulkheads so constructed\
  \ as to be capable of preventing the passage of flame to the end of the first \n\
  one half -hour of the standard fire test.  \nFinal Report MO -2018 -202 \n<< Page\
  \ 15 >>\n Regist er will increase and , poten tially, safety standards will fall\
  \ further behind \ncontemporary standards.   \n3.48. The Commission has made recommendations\
  \ to the director of Maritime New Zealand \nto address this issue.  \n  \n \n\n\
