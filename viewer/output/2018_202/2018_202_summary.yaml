- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The crew of the Dong Won 701 had received approved shore-based firefighting training and were required to be current with the vessel's firefighting procedures (3.20). However, the crew's response to the fire did not comply fully with company procedures and good industry practice (4.3), indicating a gap in the application of their training to the actual emergency situation. This suggests that while training was provided, the competency in applying that training was lacking, contributing to the accident.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The crew's response to the fire did not comply fully with company procedures and good industry practice (4.3). Several important procedures were not followed, such as closing all doors and openings to the space where the fire was located to deprive it of oxygen (3.22), and the crew did not evacuate the vessel until ordered to do so by FENZ (3.21). This lack of adherence to safety procedures allowed the fire to spread rapidly and contributed significantly to the accident.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The fire-detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm (3.12), and the crew did not push a manual button to raise the alarm (3.18). The uncoordinated response to the fire continued until FENZ arrived and took command (3.26). The delay in alerting all crew to the fire was a missed opportunity to extinguish it before it escalated out of control (3.28). These factors indicate a lack of preparedness for an emergency response, which contributed to the accident.
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The fire-detection and alarm systems are critical systems that should be routinely tested (3.13), but the crew responsible for testing the fire alarm system could not describe a routine regime for checking that all components were functional (3.14). This suggests that maintenance and inspection regimes were not adequately followed, which contributed to the failure of the fire-detection system during the incident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The crew regularly left the alarm system in manual mode to avoid nuisance alarms (3.17), and the crew did not activate the alarm manually on detecting the fire (4.2). This indicates a culture where convenience was prioritized over strict adherence to safety protocols, contributing to the accident.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards (3.3, 4.5). The Dong Won 701 was considered a pre-2004 ship and was 'grandparented' and deemed compliant with Rule 40D, despite not meeting contemporary safety standards (3.34). This regulatory oversight and lack of compliance with modern safety standards contributed to the rapid spread of the fire (3.38).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The crew's response to the fire was uncoordinated (3.26), with several crew members taking their own courses of action (3.25). This lack of effective crew resource management, where the crew did not work together cohesively or support each other in decision-making processes, contributed to the ineffective response to the fire.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The crew's inability to work the portable emergency fire pump to pressurize the fire hoses (3.27) and the failure to close doors and ventilation flaps (3.22) can be attributed to human error and incorrect assumptions about the state of the equipment and the procedures to follow during the emergency. These errors contributed to the accident.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The lack of effective risk management is evident in the failure to ensure that the fire-detection system was functional (3.12-3.15) and in the absence of a crew muster to account for everyone on board (3.21). This contributed to the accident by delaying the response and allowing the fire to spread.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no specific mention in the document of a failure in situational awareness contributing to the accident. The crew were aware of the fire but failed to respond appropriately due to other factors.

    '
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not provide information suggesting that the use of automation or over-reliance on automated systems was a contributing factor to the accident.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions are not mentioned as a contributing factor to the fire or the crew''s response to it in the document.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that communication breakdown among the crew or with external parties was a contributing factor to the accident.

    '
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that fatigue management or issues related to crew fatigue contributed to the accident.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: While there were issues with the use of firefighting equipment (3.27), these are more directly related to emergency response preparedness and crew resource management rather than a lack of training and familiarity with the equipment itself.
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the accident outside of those predefined.
