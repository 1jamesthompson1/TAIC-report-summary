Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Fire-related issues: The report highlights the seriousness of fires on board ships and the need for effective fire-resistant design, construction, detection, and alarm systems. The cause of the fire in this case could not be conclusively determined, but the report discusses the area of origin and potential sources of ignition. It also points out that the fire-detection system did not function automatically, and possible reasons for this are explored.

2. Crew response and firefighting procedures: The report identifies that some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice. It mentions the importance of containing the fire and depriving it of oxygen, but notes that doors, openings, and ventilation flaps were left open, allowing the fire to spread rapidly. The delay in alerting all crew members to the fire and the uncoordinated response are also highlighted.

3. Inconsistencies in safety standards: The report raises concerns about inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D, which resulted in some fishing vessels not fully complying with relevant safety standards. It mentions the use of grandparent rights, which allow older vessels to operate without meeting contemporary safety standards. The potential risks and implications of these inconsistencies are discussed, and recommendations are made to address the issue.
