Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Fire-related risks and management: The report highlights the serious nature of fires on board ships and the need for effective fire-resistant design, fire-detection systems, firefighting appliances, and procedures. It also mentions the potential consequences of inconsistencies in the application of safety standards.

2. Failure of fire detection and alarm system: The report identifies that the fire-detection system on the Dong Won 701 did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm. Possible reasons for this include faults with the smoke detector, interruption in power supply, or the system being left in manual mode.

3. Inadequate crew response: The report points out that some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice. It mentions the lack of a crew muster, failure to close doors and openings to contain the fire, and uncoordinated actions by crew members. These factors contributed to the rapid spread of the fire and delayed firefighting efforts.

4. Inconsistencies in safety standards: The report highlights inconsistencies in the application of safety standards for fishing vessels. It mentions that up to 12 fishing vessels may not fully comply with the relevant safety standards, and that older vessels are allowed to operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards.

5. Structural fire integrity: The report states that the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701, although compliant with the relevant Maritime Rule, did not meet contemporary standards. This contributed to the speed and intensity with which the fire spread.

6. Need for regulatory improvements: The report suggests the need for improvements in the application of safety standards and regulations. It recommends putting a cap on the year of construction applicable to the rule and limiting the number of years a vessel is allowed to operate without meeting modern standards. This is to prevent older vessels from entering the system and to ensure that safety standards do not fall behind contemporary standards.
