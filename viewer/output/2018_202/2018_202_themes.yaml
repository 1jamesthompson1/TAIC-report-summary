- name: Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
  explanation: The fire detection and alarm systems are a critical safety theme in this accident because they failed to detect the fire and sound the general alarm, which delayed the firefighting response. The document states that "the fire-detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm" (3.12) and that "the crew responsible for testing the fire alarm system explained that the fire alarms were 'tested', but they were unable to describe anything that resembled a routine regime for checking that all components of the fire alarm system were functional" (3.14). This indicates that the fire detection and alarm systems, which are supposed to alert the crew early to enable a swift response, did not operate as intended, contributing to the severity of the incident.
- name: Crew Response and Firefighting Procedures
  explanation: The crew's response to the fire and the firefighting procedures they followed are another safety theme, as some aspects of the crew's response did not meet industry good practice. The report highlights that "some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice" (3.3) and that "the crew's response to the fire did not comply fully with company procedures and good industry practice" (4.3). This suggests that the crew's actions, or lack thereof, were not in line with established protocols, which could have mitigated the fire's impact had they been followed correctly.
- name: Fire-Resistant Design and Construction
  explanation: Fire-resistant design and construction is a safety theme because the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701 did not meet contemporary standards, which was a factor in the rapid spread of the fire. The report indicates that "the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701, although complying with the relevant Maritime Rule, did not meet contemporary standards" (4.4) and that "the internal corridor bulkheads and cabin doors on the Dong Won 701 were of hardboard or similar wood-product construction and suffered complete combustion in the fire" (3.38). This lack of contemporary fire-resistant design and construction allowed the fire to spread more quickly and intensely.
- name: Application of Maritime Rules
  explanation: 'The application of Maritime Rules, specifically Rule 40D, is a safety theme because inconsistencies in its application may have resulted in vessels not fully complying with the relevant safety standards. The report states that "inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D: Design, Construction and Equipment - Fishing Ships may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards" (3.3) and that "due to the inconsistency of how maritime rules part 40d was applied to ships entered into the new zealand fishing ship register after 2004, there are up to 12 ships that likely do not meet the standards required of the rule" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This indicates that the inconsistent application of safety rules could lead to vessels being less safe than intended.'
- name: Grandparent Rights and Vessel Age
  explanation: Grandparent rights and the age of vessels are a safety theme because older vessels are allowed to operate without meeting contemporary safety standards, potentially putting crews at greater risk. The document mentions that "a further 50 fishing vessels have been afforded grandparent rights that will allow them to operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards under the current maritime rules" (3.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)) and that "an adverse effect of applying grandparent rights to older standards is that the crews are not afforded the same level of safety" (3.36). This suggests that the practice of grandparent rights may compromise safety by permitting outdated safety standards to persist.
- name: Emergency Preparedness and Training
  explanation: Emergency preparedness and training is a safety theme because, despite the crew having received approved shore-based firefighting training, their actions during the emergency suggest that training and preparedness were insufficient. The report notes that "the crew of the Dong Won 701 had all received approved shore-based firefighting training" (3.20), yet "several important procedures were not followed" (3.21) and "this uncoordinated response to the fire continued until FENZ arrived and took command of the scene" (3.26). This indicates that the crew's training did not translate into effective action during the actual emergency.
