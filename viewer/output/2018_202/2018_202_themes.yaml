- name: Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
  explanation: The theme of fire detection and alarm systems is highly relevant to this accident because the automatic fire-alarm and fire-detection system installed on the Dong Won 701 failed to detect the fire and sound the general alarm. "During this fire the fire-detection system did not detect the fire or sound the general alarm" (3.12). This failure delayed the firefighting response, which is critical for the safety of ship and crew, as early detection allows for immediate response and potential extinguishment of the fire before it escalates (3.11). The reasons for the system's failure to activate could include a fault with the smoke detector, an interruption in power supply, or the system being left in manual mode (3.15). The crew also did not use manual push-button alarms to raise the alarm for everyone on board (3.18).
- name: Crew Response and Firefighting Procedures
  explanation: The crew's response to the fire and their adherence to firefighting procedures is a significant safety theme because the crew's actions did not meet industry good practice. "Some aspects of the crew response to the fire did not meet industry good practice" (3.3). The crew did not follow the vessel's emergency checklists appropriately, did not evacuate the vessel until ordered by the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ), and failed to account for all crew members (3.21). Additionally, after initial attempts to fight the fire, the crew left doors and ventilation flaps open, allowing the fire to spread rapidly (3.22-3.23). The uncoordinated response continued until FENZ took command (3.26).
- name: Fire-Resistant Design and Construction
  explanation: Fire-resistant design and construction is a pertinent safety theme because the structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701 did not meet contemporary standards, which contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. "The structural fire integrity of the Dong Won 701, although complying with the relevant Maritime Rule, did not meet contemporary standards" (4.4). The vessel was considered a pre-2004 ship and was 'grandparented,' meaning it was deemed compliant with Rule 40D without meeting modern safety standards (3.34). This resulted in features such as corridor bulkheads and cabin doors made of combustible materials and stairwells without fire-resistant doors, which allowed the fire to spread quickly (3.37-3.38).
- name: Maritime Rules and Regulatory Consistency
  explanation: "The theme of maritime rules and regulatory consistency is relevant to this accident due to inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D, which may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels not fully complying with the relevant safety standards. \"Inconsistencies in the application of Maritime Rules Part 40D: Design, Construction and Equipment \u2013 Fishing Ships may have resulted in up to 12 fishing vessels operating under the New Zealand Flag not complying fully with the relevant safety standards\" (3.3). The lack of clarity in the rules and inconsistent application by surveyors prior to 2017 led to a situation where older vessels could operate indefinitely without meeting contemporary safety standards (3.40-3.46)."
- name: Training and Safety Drills
  explanation: Training and safety drills are a critical safety theme because, despite the crew of the Dong Won 701 having received approved shore-based firefighting training, their response to the actual fire did not fully comply with company procedures or good industry practice. "The crew of the Dong Won 701 had all received approved shore-based firefighting training" (3.20), yet they did not follow the vessel's firefighting procedures during the emergency (3.21). Regular training and drills are intended to ensure that crew members are prepared to respond effectively in an emergency, but this incident demonstrates a gap between training and actual performance.
- name: Vessel Age and Modern Safety Standards
  explanation: The age of the vessel and adherence to modern safety standards is a safety theme because the Dong Won 701, being an older vessel, was allowed to operate without meeting newer safety standards due to 'grandparent rights.' "An adverse effect of applying grandparent rights to older standards is that the crews are not afforded the same level of safety" (3.36). This discrepancy in safety standards between older and newer vessels poses a risk to crew safety, as older vessels may not have the same fire-resistant features and may not be equipped with the latest fire detection and suppression technologies (3.37-3.39).
