- name: Weight and Balance Management
  explanation: Weight and balance management is a critical safety theme as it directly affects the performance capabilities of an aircraft. In this accident, the helicopter was "loaded by an estimated 30 kilograms above the maximum permitted weight of 2,250 kilograms, with its longitudinal centre of gravity an estimated up to 3.0 centimetres forward of the maximum permissible limit" (5.3). This overloading and improper balance likely contributed to the helicopter operating "at or close to the performance limit for an out-ground-effect hover" (5.4), which in turn may have led to the initial sink on the landing approach as the airspeed reduced. The use of standard loading configurations that use standard passenger weights was deemed inappropriate for operations close to permissible limits (5.7), highlighting the importance of accurate weight and balance calculations in flight safety.
- name: Helicopter Performance Understanding
  explanation: Understanding the performance capabilities of the helicopter is essential for safe flight operations, especially during high-risk activities such as heli-skiing. The accident highlighted the importance of pilots' pre-flight planning to ensure that helicopters will have sufficient performance to conduct intended flights safely (4.3.48). The pilot in this accident did not estimate the total weight accurately and therefore would not have known accurately the combined effect of the total weight, the air temperature, and the pressure altitude (4.3.25). The helicopter began an uncommanded descent during the final phase of the landing, likely because it was approaching an out-of-ground-effect hover with minimal performance capability at that weight, altitude, and temperature (4.3.50).
- name: Seatbelt Usage and Passenger Restraint
  explanation: Proper use of seatbelts and passenger restraint is a safety theme that emerged from this accident. It was found that "several of the passengers' seatbelts were not securely adjusted" (5.11), which increased the likelihood of passengers being ejected from the aircraft during the accident. The investigation revealed that the lap belts for some seats were found at or near full extension, which would have given a very loose fit around the waist (4.6.8). This loose fitting of seatbelts could have contributed to the ejection of passengers from the helicopter during the crash.
- name: Pilot Training and Competency
  explanation: Pilot training and competency are crucial for ensuring that flight operations are conducted safely, particularly in specialized and high-risk operations like heli-skiing. The pilot involved in the accident was trained in accordance with the operator's training standards and was experienced in heli-ski operations (5.9). However, the Commission noted a lack of formal recording of issues relating to the pilot's performance (4.4.9), and it was suggested that it would have been good practice for the pilot to undergo a specific heli-ski assessment flight for what is acknowledged as a high-risk operation (4.4.8). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of thorough and well-documented training, especially for operations that involve additional risks.
- name: Operational Culture within the Helicopter Sector
  explanation: The operational culture within the helicopter sector is a safety theme that has broader implications beyond the individual accident. There are indications that a culture exists among some helicopter pilots in New Zealand of operating their aircraft beyond the published and placarded limits (5.10). Such a culture can adversely affect the safety performance of the helicopter sector and has the potential to contribute to accidents. This theme is relevant to the accident as it reflects on the wider practices and attitudes that can influence pilot decision-making and risk assessment.
- name: Emergency Preparedness and Response
  explanation: Emergency preparedness and response are critical for minimizing the consequences of an accident once it has occurred. In this case, the helicopter was fitted with a 406-megahertz emergency locator transmitter, which activated upon impact and alerted the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (4.6.14). The injured guide was also able to alert another helicopter pilot within minutes of the accident. The prompt alert and response likely aided in the timely rescue of the survivors. This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of having effective emergency response protocols and equipment in place, which can be crucial for the survival and recovery of accident victims.
