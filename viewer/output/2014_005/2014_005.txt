The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blam e or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be bala nced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and co -ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organis ations overseas.  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of the occurrences with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency or to pursue (o r to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Saturday 16 August 2014 , the weather was fine and clear with light variable winds in the 
Mount Aspiring National Park area.  The Helicopter Line was using several AS350 -B2 (Squirrel) 
helicopters to  ferry heli -ski groups to the top of various ski runs in the area.  
1.2. One of the helicopters was on its fourth heli -ski flight for the morning, ferrying a group of five 
skiers and their ski guide to a ridgeline close to the summit of Mount Alta.  On the appro ach to 
the landing site the helicopter began to descend below the pilot's intended angle of approach.  
The pilot discontinued  the approach by turning the helicopter away from the ridgeline and 
down the mountain.  However, the pilot was unable to avoid the terrain and  the helicopter 
struck the steep, snow -clad slope heavily and rolled 300 metres down the mountain.  
1.3. The cabin structure broke apart and five of the seven occupants were ejected from the 
helicopter as it rolled down the mountain.  Two passengers r emained strapped to their seats.  
One of the passengers was trapped under the helicopter and died from his injuries.  The 
remaining six occupants received moderate to serious injuries.  The helicopter was destroyed.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the  total  weight of 
the helicopter was about  30 kilograms  over the maximum permissible weight , and the centre 
of gravity was about  3.0 centimetres ahead of the forward limit .  The helicopter was operating 
at or close to  the limit of its performance capability to maintain a hover outside of 'ground 
effect' at that weight and at the temperature and altitude of the landing site .  This was a likely 
factor in the pilot not achiev ing a safe landing . 
1.5. The Commission was unable t o make a conclusive finding on whether the helicopter was 
affected by a phenomenon known as 'vortex ring state '. 
1.6. The Commission found  no mechanical reason for the accident.  The engine was delivering high 
power and the helicopter was controllable.  The pilot was experienced and had received 
training in mountain flying and heli-ski operations.  
1.7. Two safety issues  were identified during this inquiry.  The  first was that the operator's 
standard operating procedures did not require its pilots to routinely calculat e the performance 
capabilit ies of their helicopters for the intended flights . 
1.8. The second was that there was a risk of not knowing an aircraft's cap ability when using 
standard passenger weights , and therefore of pilots operating close to the limits of the ir 
aircraft's performance.  
1.9. This accident and others are suggestive of  a third safety issue , which is some New Zealand 
helicopter pilots may have a culture  of operating their aircraft beyond the manufacturers' 
published and placarded limits , with the possibility that such a culture has become 
normalised.  
1.10.  The importance of pilots knowing the performance capabilit ies of their aircraft and of 
observing p ublished limitations is well known.  For example, the  Civil Aviation Authority  has 
commented:  
Take -off, landing and hovering are all potentially risky phases of helicopter flight.  The more 
that we can do as pilots to minimise these risks - especially when  operating at high gross 
weights, from challenging sites, with high density altitudes - the safer we will be . 
Most performance -related accidents can be prevented, provided that the pilot maintains a 
good awareness of the surrounding conditions, knows the performance limitations of the 
helicopter, always does a power check before committing to a marginal situation, and is 
disciplined enough to "give it away early" if the odds are stacking up against getting the job 
done safely.  (CAA, 2012, p. 33)  
1.11.  A number of safety actions  were taken in respect  of these safety issues.   

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 1.12.  The Commission made t hree  recommendations  to the Director of Civil Aviation to address the 
safety issues.  
1.13.  The key lessons  arising from this inquiry  are: 
● flying in mountainous terrain places additional demands on a pilot's skills and an 
aircraft's performance.  Both could be at or near the limits of their capabilities.  Operators 
need to ensure that their safety management systems address the additional risks 
associated with flying in such an environment  
● the use of 'standard' or 'assessed' passenger weights is not a licence to exceed an 
aircraft's permissible weight and balance parameters.  Any aircraft being operated 
outside the permissible range will have a higher risk of having an accident, particularly 
when being operated near the margins of aircraft performance capability  
● it is important for operators to keep comprehensive, formal records of all pilot training.  
Historical training records provide the basi s for ongoing performance monitoring  and 
professional development , particularly given natural attrition as safety and training 
managers move through the industry  
● seatbelts are only effective in preventing or minimising injury if they are fastened and 
prope rly adjusted.  Aircraft operators must ensure that passengers and crew fasten their 
seatbelts and adjust them to fit tightly across their hips  
● vortex ring state is a known hazard for helicopters.  To avoid the hazard, pilots must:  
a.  remain alert to the c onditions conducive to the formation of vortex ring state  
b.  closely monitor the airspeed and rate of descent during the final approach  
c.  initiate recovery action at the first indication that they may be approaching vortex 
ring state.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On the afternoon of Saturday 16 August 2014, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (the Commission)  of the accident.  The 
Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accid ent Investigation 
Commission Act 1990, and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 16 August 2014 the Commission notified the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) of 
France, which was the State of Manufacture for the helicopter and the engine.  In accorda nce 
with Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, France appointed a BEA 
investigator as its Accredited Representative to participate in the investigation.  
2.3. Three of the Commission's  investigators arrived in Queenstown on the afternoon o f 17 August 
2014 and conducted an initial survey of the accident site from a helicopter.  The investigators 
conducted a full site examination on 18 August 2014.  The wreckage was removed later that 
day and transported to the Commission's technical facility  in Wellington for further detailed 
examination.  
2.4. In the following three days, witnesses and first responders to the accident were interviewed.  
The maintenance records for the helicopter were obtained by the Commission and relevant 
engineering personnel we re interviewed.  The helicopter was not fitted with any equipment to 
record data, and no other source of recorded data was obtained from the accident flight.  
2.5. On 25 and 26 August 2014 the investigator in charge interviewed the surviving passengers.  
The inv estigation reviewed the CAA files concerning The Helicopter Line (the operator) and the 
pilot.  On 3 September 2014 the operator's general manager and chief pilot were interviewed.  
2.6. On 14 November 2014, at the request of the Commission, the helicopter manu facturer, Airbus 
Helicopters, completed an analysis of relevant helicopter performance data.  
2.7. On 28 January 2015, once the snow had melted, a team searched the accident site for any 
unrecovered items.  The search team recovered some items from the helicopte r. 
2.8. Between December 2014 and February 2015 , the Commission obtained additional 
information through BEA concerning the helicopter seats and seatbelts.  
2.9. On 19 October 2015 the engine was examined by Turbomeca at its maintenance facility in 
Sydney, Australia.   The Australian Transport Safety Bureau appointed an Accredited 
Representative to the Commission's inquiry to supervise the examination on behalf of the 
Commission.  On 29 October 2015 the Australian Transport Safety Bureau provided the 
Commission with a report on the engine examination.  
2.10.  On 27 January 2016 three investigators from BEA and a senior investigator from Airbus 
Helicopters travelled to New Zealand and examined the wreckage of the helicopter at the 
Commission's technical facility.  
2.11.  On 24 August 20 16 the Commission approved the circulation of the draft report to interested 
persons for comment  and received submissions from four interested persons.   
2.12.  In response to the submissions received, the Commission undertook further independent 
enquiries , which included a review of all the primary evidence and information it had received 
from all sources.  The Commission also sought the opinion of an expert who had a long 
association with heli -skiing operations in Canada as a helicopter pilot, a regulator  and an 
independent accident investigator.  
2.13.  On 24 May 2017  the Commission approved the circulation of a revised draft report to 
interested persons affected by the changes .  Substantive submissions were received from 
three interested persons , including the o perator and the regulator  (CAA) .  The Commission 
requested further information concerning those submissions . 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 2.14.  On 23 August 2017  the Commission approved the circulation of a 2nd revised  draft report to 
interested persons for their  comment.   Further submissions were received and these were 
considered in the preparation of the final report.  
2.15.  On 25 October 2017, the Commission deferred publication of its final report due to 
prosecution proceedings the CAA and the operator were parties to, and w hich was proceeding 
to trial in November. The Commission wanted to ensure its report did not affect the fair 
administration of justice.  
2.16.  On 16 November 2017, the Commission approved publication of its final report following 
notification the prosecution pro ceedings were not proceeding to trial.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On the evening of Friday 15 August 2014, the pilot and the heli -skiing co -ordinator for the 
operator discussed the plan for the next day.  There were three skiing groups3 with whom the 
pilot would be flying the next day.  
3.1.2.  The heli -skiing was initially organised through an associated company (the heli -ski provider), 
which had taken the bookings and organised guides for each group.4  Five of the operator's 
helicopters were to  be used to support heli -skiing groups during the day, mainly in the 
mountains between Mount Aspiring National Park and Lake Wanaka.  
16 August 2014  
3.1.3.  At 0754 on Saturday 16 August 2014, the pilot took off from Queenstown in an AS350 -B2 
helicopter and took a group of passengers to the Cardrona snow park. He then continued to 
Wanaka where he delivered the helicopter to the maintenance provider.  The pilot then picked 
up another AS350 -B2 helicopter, the one involved in the accident (the helicopter).  The 
operato r had recently imported the helicopter from the United States, and this was to be its 
first commercial flight in New Zealand.  
3.1.4.  The pilot met with the engineer who had supervised the maintenance check and fitting of 
equipment to the helicopter.  Together the y transferred the ski basket  and other equipment, 
checked the documentation and conducted a visual inspection of the helicopter.  The pilot 
then flew the helicopter back to Queenstown to meet up with the ski groups.  
3.1.5.  At 1002 the pilot landed back at Queenst own and the three groups were  given their helicopter 
safety briefing in preparation for the day's activities.  A heli -ski guide loaded  the first group of 
five, group A, and their gear onto the helicopter.  Group A was to be flown to the Phoebe Creek 
staging area  in the lower Matukituki Valley west of Wanaka (see Figure 1) , while groups B and 
C travelled by road . 
3.1.6.  When the pilot boarded the helicopter he  noted that the passengers in group A were all males 
of about medium build.  The guide told the pilot  that he did not know what the passenger 
weights were .  The pilot spoke with one of the passengers, who confirmed that they had not 
been individually weighed but that they each weighed about 85 kilograms ( kg).  The pilot 
thought this was a reasonable estim ate that he would use when calculating his fuel loads for 
the loaded flights to the high -altitude drop -off points for the rest of the day.  At 1014 the 
helicopter departed for Phoebe  Creek .  
3.1.7.  The pilot fuelled the helicopter at Phoebe Creek while the groups were briefed by their 
allocated guides on mountain safety and the day's activities.  The guides were equipped with 
radios to communicate with their respective pilots on a common frequency.  
3.1.8.  The helicopter, like most of the operator's other helicopters, was configured with a dual front 
seat to the left of the pilot and four seats across the rear of the cabin.  The pilot asked a 
smaller member of the group to occupy the front centre seat next to him.  This was a company 
procedure to minimise t he risk of exceeding the weight and balance limits of the helicopter , 
and to minimise the risk of a passenger's arm obstructing the pilot's use of the collective 
lever5 located between them.  
3.1.9.  Group A and their guide then boarded the helicopter and were flow n to the top of their first ski 
run - known as Tony's Run.  The pilot returned to the staging area and repeated the exercise 
                                                        
 
3 The three groups are i dentified as groups A, B and C.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 with group B.  On returning to uplift group C the pilot refuelled the helicopter to nearly 60% 
capacity.  
3.1.10.  The pilot then flew group  C to the top of Tony's Run and descended to the bottom of the run to 
uplift group A for their next run, which was to be from near the summit of Mount Alta.  The 
smaller passenger returned to his allocated front -centre seat .  The guide sat in the front -left 
seat and donned a headset to talk to the pilot and discuss the next run.  The pilot then flew 
the helicopter in a climbing left -hand orbit around Mount Alta to enable the pilot and guide to 
assess the conditions.  The pilot and guide agreed to land group s A and B at a designated 
landing site on a flat ridge near the summit and group C further down the mountain.6

 3.1.11.  The weather conditions were nearly calm with a very light southerly wind.  The pilot elected to 
approach the landing site from the northwest, into the light southerly wind.  A length of orange 
ribbon on a cane pole had previously been pl aced close to the landing site to act as a wind 
marker  for pilots.  As the helicopter neared the landing site the pilot was unable to see the 
wind marker, because it was below a small snowbank.  He was not sure wh ere the wind was 
from  and considered the po ssibility that there was a tailwind, so he maintained his airspeed 
and overflew the ridge.  
3.1.12.  After passing over the ridge, t he pilot and guide saw the wind marker  below the ridgeline .  The 
wind marker indicated a light southerly breeze, so the pilot overfle w the landing site a second 
time and repositioned the helicopter on the north side of the ridge for an approach (see 
Figures 2 and 3).

3.1.13.  The pilot said he made a relatively shallow approach to the landing site.  His last check of the 
engine torque gauge showed a power demand that he thought was appropriate for an 
approach at that  altitude .7  At a point the pilot later estimated to have been 10 to 20 m etres 
(m) from the landing site , he noticed that the helicopter' s rate of descent  had increased ; he 
described it as "a bit of a sink ".  The pilot  raised the collective lever slightly in an attempt to 
maintain his preferred approach angle .  The guide recalled that the helicopter appeared to be  
"almost stopped " when it was about 30 m from the site  and 2 to 3 m above it .  At that point 
the pilot turned the helicopter left in the direction of his planned escape route  and d escended  
away from the ridgeline .  The pilot said that a s the helicopter turned downhill , he felt it sink 
rapid ly and unexpected ly.  Before he could  take any action to arrest the descent the helicopter 
struck the side of the slope heavily.  
3.1.14.  The helicopter tumbled forward then rolled down the steep slope, coming to rest 315 m below 
the ridgeline.  Five of the occupants were thrown from the fuselage as it rolled down the side 
of the mountain.  One of the five passengers was trapped underneath t he helicopter where it 
came to rest in an upright position.  He had died from his injuries.  The remaining two 
passengers were still restrained in their seats.  
3.1.15.  The guide had been restrained in his seat until the seatbelt attachment  broke and he was 
thrown from the helicopter.  He used his radio to call the guides of groups B and C and alert 
them to the accident.  T he pilot of another company helicopter in the area  heard of the 
accident and initiated the operator's emergency plan by informing the operator's Queenstown 
base staff and calling a halt to all other heli -skiing operations.  Meanwhile, one of the 
passenger s who had been thrown clear of the helicopter found the aircraft's first aid kit and 
moved down the mountain providing first aid to the other occu pants.  The pilot of the second 
helicopter uplifted two of his group's guides and flew them to the ridgeline landing site, from 
                                                        
 
7 The torque gauge is marked with a green arc up to 94% and a yellow ' caution ' range between 94% and 
100%.  The pilot  estimate d the torque was 95% of the green arc, or approximately 89% torque.

 where they descended the mountain, assessed the condition of the injured and assisted 
where possible.  
3.1.16.  During the next hour emerg ency helicopters with medical personnel arrived on the scene.  The 
more severely injured were winched off the mountain and flown to hospital in Dunedin.  Others 
were taken to Wanaka for treatment.  
3.2. Site examination  
3.2.1.  The accident site was on the northern slop e of Mount Alta, 25 kilometres (km)  northwest of 
Wanaka.  The mountain summit was at 2,339 m (7,674 feet) and the intended landing site 
was on a ridgeline of a shoulder extending to the west of the peak at about 2,300 m (7,545 
feet) .  The landing site was on a flat section of the ridgeline and was identified by a wind 
marker, a cane pole with an orange ribbon tied to it.  The marker  was located on the southern 
side of the ridgeline, still visible but below the crest of a small snowba nk.  The flat section of 
the ridgeline was long enough for up to three helicopters to land at the same time (see Figure 
4).  
3.2.2.  The landing site and main slopes were covered in snow, but exposed rock was visible about 
the summit and on some of the steeper slo pes.  The ground sloped steeply away from the 
landing area on both sides.  The northern face was the one down which the group intended to 
snowboard or ski and where the helicopter struck.  It had an initial slope of about 35º, 
reducing to about 30º further  down the mountain.  
3.2.3.  The first impact mark was a cut through the snow about 20 m below and 47 m from the 
intended landing site.  The cut extended for several metres and was adjacent to  a flattened or 
compressed area of snow and rock.  Paint transfer was fo und on some of the exposed rock s in 
this area.  The shape of the cut suggested  that one of the helicopter's skids had struck  first.  
The confused  nature of the following marks  in the snow and the paint transfer marks on the 
rocks w ere consistent with the fuselage having start ed to tumble immediately after the first 
impact.  
3.2.4.  The main rotor assembly, including the transmission and three main rotor blades, was found a 
further 45 m along the wreckage trail.  The number and pattern of rotor blade strikes in the 
snow and on the exposed rock were consistent with the main rotor blades having been turning 
at high speed (see Figure 5).

Initial impact site  
3.2.5.  The engine and part of the left skid were found about 35 m further down the slope.  The tail 
boom had separated from the fuselage and was found approximately 35 m from the engine, 
but about 20 m to the right of the path taken by the fuselage.  The tail rotor g uard had been 
bent upwards but there was little damage to the tail rotor assembly.  
3.2.6.  Marks in the snow showed that the fuselage had rolled at least 25 times before coming to rest 
about 300 m below the first impact point.  The direction of roll was to the lef t.8  The ski basket , 
with its contents still secured inside, was found a further 300 m down the slope.   
3.2.7.  The fuselage had come to rest upright.  The deceased passenger was found outside the 
fuselage, partially trapped underneath the right side of the helicopter belly.  This was on the 
uphill side of the fuselage.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 Wreckage examination  
3.2.8.  The structure around the cabin, including all the doors, roof and nose cowling, had separated, 
exposing the seats (see Figure 5).  The instrument panel had broken from its mounting but 
remained attached by wiring.  Both skids had broken in several locations.  The fuel tank was 
intact but a small amount of fuel was found leaking from the fuel line leading to the engine.  
The emerg ency locator transmitter had activated but the cable leading to the aerial had 
broken as a result of the tail boom separating.  The emergency locator transmitter was 
reported to have been turned off soon after rescue personnel arrived on -site. 
3.2.9.  The aircraft  seats remained attached to the aircraft with their cushions in place.  The pilot's 
seat back had broken but was retained by both shoulder straps that ran through guides on the 
back of the seat.  The back of the dual front seat was bent rearwards about 15º  and the rear 
bench seat was deformed in several places.  
3.2.10.  With the exception of two passengers having released themselves from their seats, there was 
no other known disturbance of the seatbelts before the arrival of the Commission's 
investigators.  Four seatbelts were found released, while the seatbelts for the pilot and a rear -
seat passenger remained buckled.  The metal tube framing that held the attachment for the 
front outboard passenger seat9 was broken.  The missing left lap belt was found a short 
distance up the slope along the wreckage trail.  
3.2.11.  The inertia reel units for the shoulder straps of all seven seatbelts functioned after the 
accident as intended.  The lap belts for the passengers were found extended to varying 
degrees, with some at near -full extension.  The pilot's lap belts were found in a position 
consistent with the belts being firm around the pilot's lap.  (See paragraphs 3.3.6 and 4. 6.4-
4.6.11 for a fuller description of the seatbelts.)  
3.2.12.  After the initial site examination , the wreckage was  removed to an assembly area, where the 
remaining fuel was removed and weighed.  A sample of the fuel was clean and of the correct 
type for the engine.  No fuel problems were reported by other users of the same fuel stock.  
3.2.13.  The ski basket  and its contents o f skis and snowboards were examined and weighed .  The 
wreckage was then transported to the Commission's technical facility in Wellington for more 
detailed examination.  
3.2.14.  All major components of the helicopter were accounted for and matched with logbook part 
descriptions and serial numbers.  No useful engine instrument readings could be obtained.   
3.2.15.  The continuity and correct operation of the main rotor cyclic10 and collective controls were 
confirmed from the pilot's controls to the engine deck, where the connec tions to the main 
rotor had separated during the accident sequence.  Correct tail rotor control functionality was 
confirmed from the tail rotor pedals to where the tail boom had separated from the fuselage, 
and from that point to the tail rotor.  
3.2.16.  The outer section of each main rotor blade displayed damage that indicated the main rotor 
had been operating at high speed when it struck the slope.  The three arms of the Starflex 
main rotor head displayed rotational damage.  The arms of the yellow and blue blades were 
fractured but the blades remained attached to the hub.11  The attachment for the red blade 
had fractured but not separated. The direction of the fractures was consistent with the blades 
having been under power at the time of impact.

 3.2.17.  The drive shaft and  coupling tube that connected the engine to the main transmission had 
separated at the two flexible couplings.  Scoring on the inside of the coupling tube was 
consistent with the engine having continued to rotate the drive shaft as the engine and 
transmiss ion separated from the fuselage.  The damage to the flexible couplings was 
consistent with this sequence and showed that the engine had continued to drive the 
freewheeling assembly12 as the helicopter started to disintegrate.  
Engine investigation  
3.2.18.  The engin e was shipped to the engine manufacturer's facility in Sydney, Australia for detailed 
examination under the supervision of the Accredited Representative for Australia, on behalf of 
the Commission.  
3.2.19.  A condensed version of the report prepared by the Australia n Accredited Representative is in 
Appendix 1.  The examination determined the following:  
● it was concluded that the engine was operating and capable of normal operation  
● the misalignment of the drive shaft was indicative of an engine delivering power at the 
time the helicopter struck the ridgeline. This movement of the drive shaft was 
associated with a torque spike attributed to power -train shock loads generated from a 
main rotor system strike.  
3.3. Aircraft information  
3.3.1.  ZK-HYO was a Eurocopter AS350 -B2 helicopter , serial number 3885, manufactured in 
November 2004.  Also known as the Écureuil or Squirrel, the AS350 was first developed by 
Aérospatiale of France in 1974.  The B2 was powered by one Arriel 1D1 engine and was a 
higher -gross -weight version of the origina l B1 model.  
3.3.2.  The helicopter had been imported to New Zealand from the United States in April 2014 and 
given the registration ZK -HYO.  For the helicopter to be issued with a New Zealand 
airworthiness certificate, the CAA had directed the owner to complete t he certification 
requirements prescribed by Civil Aviation Rules.13  The requirements had included, among 
other things, the completion of a 100 -hour inspection in accordance with the manufacturer's 
maintenance schedule, and an inspection of the helicopter a nd associated documents by a 
CAA airworthiness inspector.  The helicopter's documentation recorded that the required 
maintenance actions had been completed.   
3.3.3.  Additional work requested by the operator had included the fitting of a dual front seat,14 a 
guard  for the collective lever and attachments for a ski basket  on the left side of the 
helicopter.  These had been fitted in accordance with the relevant supplemental type 
certificate requirements.  The helicopter had been repainted and its empty  weight and 
balance determined .  
3.3.4.  One of the operator's senior pilots had completed a maintenance check flight on 5 August 
2014  and had considered  that the helicopter performed satisfactorily .  On 15 August 2014 
the helicopter had been issued with an airworthiness certificate in the Standard Category and 
placed on the operator's Operations Specifications.  At this time the helicopter had been 
recorded as having accrued a total of 3,214.7 fligh t hours.   
3.3.5.  The engine, serial number 9517, had entered service in May 1997 and been installed in the 
helicopter in April 2009.  It had accrued a total of 6,788.1 hours.  
                                                        
 
12 An assembly within the drive train that allows the main and tail rotors to continue to rotate should there be 
a power interruption.  
13 Specifically , Civil Aviation Rules Part 21 , Certification of Products and Parts, paragraph 21.191.  
14 The seat fitted was a Dart Aerospace seat, which did not have a weight limit.  Other dual seat types used 
by the operator were restricted to 154 kg.   

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 3.3.6.  The front seats consisted of the pilot's seat on the right side and a dual seat on the left side, 
each position with a four -point harness (lap belt and two shoulder straps) and a single inertia 
reel for the shoulder straps.  The four rear seats each had a three -point harness (lap belt and 
one shoulder strap) and an inertia reel.  The six pas senger seats were fitted with the standard 
'airline' type buckle, which required a flap to be lifted to release it.  To release the pilot's 
harness, a locking mechanism on the buckle had to be lifted before the buckle was rotated to 
release the straps.  
Weight and balance  
3.3.7.  The helicopter had a maximum certified take -off weight of 2,500 kg, but was limited to 2,250 
kg when the load was carried internally .  At 2,250 kg  the allowable centre of gravity range was 
between 3.210 m and 3.425 m aft of datum.15 
3.3.8.  The hel icopter's basic (empty) weight, determined on 2 August 2014, was 1,326.95 kg,16 with 
a centre of gravity 3.604 m aft of datum.  
3.3.9.  See paragraphs 4.3. 6-4.3.23 for a detailed examination of the weight and balance for the 
accident flight.  
3.4. The pilot  
3.4.1.  The pilot had completed his initial helicopter training in Australia and obtained his Australian 
commercial pilot licence (helicopter) in November 2002.  He had obtained grade 2 and grade 
1 instructor qualifications in 2003 and 2004 respectively.17  In November 2005 the pilot had 
been issued with a New Zealand commercial pilot licence (helicopter).  He had joined the 
operator in December 2007 as a full -time line pilot.   
3.4.2.  At the time of the accident the pilot had accrued 4,176 hours flying helicopters, including 
about 605 hours in the AS350.  He had also flown 1,493 hours in the AS355 helicopter, a 
twin-engine version of the AS350.  His previous annual competency check flight had been 
flown on 1 May 2014 and he had passed the associated theory examination the following day.    
3.4.3.  The pilot held a current Class 1 medical certificate valid until April 2015.  A requirement of his 
medical certificate was that he wear  distance -vision  spectacles .  At the time of the accident 
the pilot was wearing his prescription glasses.  The glasses were tinted to help protect against 
bright light.  The pilot said that he had slept well the night before the accident and was not 
suffering from any illness or fat igue.  In accordance with the operator's procedures, blood and 
urine samples were taken from him after the accident.  These were found to be negative for 
any performance -impairing substances.  
3.4.4.  A review of the pilot's activities in the seven days leading up to the accident identified nothing 
of note.  He had had two rostered days off but had otherwise averaged eight -hour working 
days.  He had flown a total of 4.3 hours in the preceding three days.  The remainder of his 
time had been spent undertaking his addi tional duties as the operator's quality assurance 
officer, a position he had held since September 2010.  
3.4.5.  According to the pilot's logbook and the operator's records, the pilot had been first considered 
for heli -skiing flights in July 2011. The pilot had completed the operator's ground training and 
then undergone an assessment flight, after which it had been determined that he did not  
meet the operator's required standards for heli -skiing flying.  During the assessment flight t he 
instructor  had not been comfo rtable with the pilot's approaches and  considered that he

17 These Australian qualifications were  equivalent to New Zealand Category B and Category A  instructor 
qualifications respectively.   
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005

 needed more training before  he flew heli -skiing operations , and that he needed to be re -
evaluated for heli -skiing in the future .  The operator had deferred further heli-ski training  for 
the pilot until the 2012  season, so he had continued with his normal flying duties , accru ing a 
further 290 hours of flying time.  
3.4.6.  On 2 May 2012, before the start of the heli -skiing season, the pilot  had completed a one -hour 
heli-skiing training flight  and assessment  with the same instructor who had assessed him in 
the previous season .  The instructor  recommended that the pilot work on aspects of his flight 
skills  and be reassessed in one month's time. On 7 June 2012 the pilot completed a  further  
1.6-hour training and assessment flight  with the same instructor .  The instructor  considered  
that the pilot was flying safe ly and conservatively and recommended  that he commence heli -
skiing operations under supervision and with restrictions. The pilot  repeated the ground 
training syllabus and was approved for heli -skiing operations with restrictions.  The restrictions 
included:  
● being under supervision  
● being limited to the Mot atapu Ridge, Black Peak and Fog Peak  A trails  
● a marker stake was to be present at each of th e landing sites  
● he was to be briefed on avalanche terrain and where to park the helicopter safely.  
3.4.7.  The operator's records show ed that the pilot had completed the avalanche safety training on 3 
July 2012.  He had then flown a total of 29 hours on heli -skiing operations during the 2012 
heli-skiing season , under the supervision of the operator's senior heli -skiing pilots.  On 30 
June 2013, at the start of the 2013 heli -skiing season, the pilot had been approved as a 
Category A  pilot.18  The pilot had then flown a total of 25 hours on heli -skiing operations during 
the 2013 winter season.  At the time of the accident he had accrued approximately 69 hours 
on heli -skiing operations in the Queenstown and Wanaka areas.  His logbook re corded that he 
had most recently landed at the Mount Alta landing site on 26 July 2014, three weeks before 
the accident.19 
3.4.8.  The operator advised that , unless otherwise stated , the appointment to Category A pilot 
removed any previous restrictions, including any restrictions for heli -skiing . The document 
approving the pilot as a Category A pilot had been signed off by the instructor and the chief 
pilot.  There were  no records of the process es that management had followed  prior to the 
appointment of the pilot as  a Category A pilot.    
3.4.9.  Notwithstanding the absence of documentation on the decision to upgrade the pilot, the 
operator considered that the pilot  met its standards of a Category A pilot  and could therefore 
fly without landing site restrictions . 
3.5. Meteorological information  
3.5.1.  On the day of the accident a large anticyclone covered the Tasman Sea with a ridge extending 
over the South Island.  
3.5.2.  The aviation forecast for the area that included Mount Alta was for wind from the southwest at 
10 knots (19 km per hour), increasing to 25 knots (46 km per hour) at 10,000 feet (3,050 m).  
The freezing level was forecast to be 6,000 feet (1 ,830 m) and the temperature at 7,000 feet 
(2,135 m) to be -1º Celsius.  The visibility was forecast to be 30 km, reducing to 2 km  in early -
morning fog.  Any low -level cloud was forecast to clear by late morning.  
3.5.3.  Witnesses said that the weather on the morning of the accident had been frosty and fine.  At a 
weather station near the Treble Cone ski field, 17 km south  of Mount Alta , the temperature at 
an elevation of 2,300 feet  (700 m)  was 9º Celsius at midday .  Other pilots who had been  flying 
in the general area of the accident site reported generally calm conditions with the occasional 
                                                        
 
18 A pilot authorised to act as pilot in command on any flight, unless a specific restriction is applied . 
19 The nature of heli -skiing meant that it was likely the pilot had landed on Mount  Alta several times that day.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 light breeze from the southwest.  A pilot of one of the helicopters involved in the rescue said 
that as he approached the landing site from the north he had felt "a puff of wind from behind ".   
3.6. Organisational and management information  
3.6.1.  The operator had been established in 1986 with the amalgamation of three helicopter 
companies, each with extensive alpine flying experience in the South Island.  The operato r's 
principal base of operations was Queenstown, with additional bases at Glentanner in Mount 
Cook National Park, Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier.  The operator held a Civil Aviation 
Rules Part 119 Air Operator's Certificate for Part 135 domestic helic opter operations involving 
the carriage of passengers and goods, including to remote areas.    
3.6.2.  At the time of the accident the operator had a fleet of 19 AS350 helicopters, which it 
considered was the most suitable type for the range of operations flown in  the mountains.  
3.6.3.  The operator appointed 'lead pilots' for each of the bases, but pilot training and competency, 
and quality assurance requirements were managed from the Queenstown base.  Both the 
operations manager20 and the chief pilot (training and compete ncy manager) would visit all 
bases  as required .  The operator's full -time pilots were paid salaries and part -time pilots paid 
a daily rate.  
3.6.4.  The operator and heli -ski provider were owned by the same parent company but operated as 
separate commercial identit ies.  The heli -ski provider promoted the heli -skiing element of the 
business, managed the bookings and provided experienced guides for each group.  It had an 
arrangement with the operator to provide helicopter support in the field.  Before the start of 
each season the operator and heli -ski provider ran combined training sessions that lasted up 
to two days.   
3.6.5.  The operator advised that in preparation for the 2014 heli -skiing season , available staff from 
both companies had attended this training on 28 and 29 J une 2014.  The training  had 
included a review of the lessons learnt in the previous season, but its main purpose had been  
to recertify some guides in first aid and helicopter loading , and to provide refresher training in 
transceiver use, avalanche awareness, and search and rescue.   Those involved in heli -skiing 
who had not been able to attend had been briefed and recertified at a later date.   It had not 
been a requirement for the pilot  to attend this training and he had already  received training in 
avalanche awareness and transceiver use .    
CAA auditing  
3.6.6.  As a routine part of the investigation the Commission reviewed the CAA's documents relating 
to the pilot, aircraft and operator.   
3.6.7.  In July 2013 the CAA had undertaken a five -yearly recertification audit of the operator prior to 
the renewal of the operator's Part 119 Air Operator's Certificate.  The audit team had made no 
adverse findings.  The audit report stated that  senior staff and  operational procedures were 
maintaining "high levels of operational safety ".  The audit report also stated  that a review of 
the CAA database "shows no significant safety issues or trends indicating systemic problems ".  
The certificate had been renewed on 16 October 2013.   
3.6.8.  Between  the renewal of its Air Operator's Certificate  and August 2014 , the operator had had 
two accidents involving its helicopters.  On 28 October 2013, while approaching to land  on a 
snowfield near Mount  Tyndall, a helicopter had collided with another helicopter that had

 already landed.  The airborne helicopter had then  become uncontrollable and crashed.  The 
pilot had been  seriously injured, and the passengers had received minor injuries.21   
3.6.9.  On 9 January 2014 a pilot from the operator' s Glentanner base had been on a local scenic 
flight when he  had reportedly experienced a loss of surface definition while landing on 
Richardson Glacier.  The helicopter had been moving sideways as it touched down , and rolled 
onto its side.  There had been  no injuries.22  During the recovery of the helicopter, a second 
helicopter's tail rotor guard had touched the snow while landing.23  There had been no 
damage.  
3.6.10.  On 30 May 2014, f ollowing the 9 January 2014  accident , two CAA staff had conducted a 'risk 
assessme nt' of the operator.  The risk assessment had been  a desk -based exercise that 
assessed the operator against predefined risk areas , and provided a grading of low, medium 
or high risk  for each area .  Its purpose had been  to guide auditors on areas  on which  to focus 
during scheduled  on-site audits .   
3.6.11.  The risk assessment was amended following  the Mount Alta accident . The risk assessment  
identified that the operator potentially fit ted a 'medium ' risk profile  in the following  areas :  
● organisational profile    
● people profile  
● incident and safety profile  
● specific group or unit safety initiatives  
● types of operation and other risks . 
3.6.12.  The risk profile generated as part of the assessment placed the operator in "the lowest of the 
CAA risk assessmen t bands for this document type", based on the overall assessment of the 
risk indicators.    
3.6.13.  On-site audits of the operator's Queenstown, Pūkaki  and Glentanner bases  were  undertaken in 
October 2014.  The auditors  made the following comments : 
● management structure had been reviewed and reporting lines clarified  
● the company had lost focus due to the diversity of the operation  
● although induction training was to a high standard, recurrent training was not following 
procedures  
● the company's written procedures for mountain recurrent training were weak  
● a new training manager  had recently been appointed and information and procedures 
were to be incorporated in the next exposition review, and follow the guidelines in A C 119-
3 (Mountain Training)24 
● the company lead p ilot was questioned on his responsibilities with reference to 
maintenance activities, and was not as knowledgeable as expected. Actions raised 
included that pilots be retrained on a regular basis.  
3.6.14.  While the auditors made some adverse comments , the routine audit programme for the 
operator was not  altered as a result of the risk assessment or the audit .  The auditors  also 
concluded that planned routine  audit s of the West Coast bases would be an opportunity to

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The accident occurred on the pilot's seventh flight for the day, the fourth heli -skiing flight.  The 
previous three heli -skiing flights had been without incident.  The pilot was in good health and 
there was no indication  of any personal or medical issues t hat might have contributed to the 
accident.  
4.1.2.  The weather conditions were suitable for the flight.  
4.1.3.  The intended landing site was one of many in the area used by the operator and could be 
approached from several directions.  The site was large enough to land up to three 
helicopters simultaneously if required.  The pilot had landed there before.  It was considered 
suitable for the conditions on the day.  
4.1.4.  The pilot said that he had been unable to maintain his intended angle of approach to the 
landing site, so he had elected to follow his escape path down the mountain slope.  However, 
he had been unable to prevent the helicopter descending rapidly and it struck the slope 
heavily.  
4.1.5.  The following analysis considers whether any of the following  factors affected  the intended 
flight path or contributed to the escape manoeuvre being unsuccessful : 
● the helicopter encountered 'sinking air ' 
● engine performance  
● the helicopter  performance  at the altitude of the landing site  
● a phenomeno n known as vortex ring state25  
● pre-flight planning  
● any combination of these factors . 
4.1.6.  The analysis also discusses two safety issues  and a potential  third  safety issue : 
● the operator's standard operating procedures did not require its pilots to routinely 
calculat e the performance capabilit ies of their helicopters for the intended flights  
● there was  a risk of not knowing an aircraft's capability when using standard passenger 
weights , and therefore of pilots operating close to the limits of the ir aircraft's performance  
● some New Zealand helicopter pilots  may have a culture of  operating  their aircraft beyond 
the manufacturers' published and placarded limits , with the possibility that such a culture 
has become normalised . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  When planning an approach and landing, a pilot needs to consider numerous factors to 
ensure that the manoeuvre is as safe as possible, especially when landing at a new or 
restrictive landing site.  For helicopter pilots many of these considerations are encapsulated 
in what is termed 'the Seven S 's': size, shape, slope, surface, surrounds, sun and select (the 
landing spot) ( Civil Aviation Safety Authority [Australia], 2012).  The specifics of each are 
described in Appendix 2.  A pilot also needs to consider the wind condi tions as part of the 
process.  
4.2.2.  Having taken all the factors into account, a pilot will determine the best approach path and 
where the termination point - hover or landing - will be.  The approach direction will

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 preferably be into the prevailing wind.  This minimises the power required during the 
approach, helps a pilot to avoid flying in the helicopter's own downwash and gives  them  time 
to manage the approach and terminat e in a hover or landing .  The approach angle is also 
crucial.  If it is too shallow or s teep there may be insufficient power available to transition to 
the hover.  When landing in a mountainous area, t he approach angle should also be above 
the 'demarcation' line where the wind changes from an updraught to a downdraught and 
where turbulence can be present.  
4.2.3.  A pilot should always have an escape route available in the event that something goes  wrong , 
for example having insufficient power to complete an approach safely.  For a pinnacle or 
ridgeline landing , the escape path may simply be to turn a way from the high ground.  For a 
helicopter such as the AS350, with a main rotor that turns clockwise ,26 a turn to the left may 
be preferable.27  A turn using left pedal requires less power than a right turn  using right pedal , 
and therefore more power would be available to the main rotor to generate rotor thrust or lift.  
4.2.4.  The power required to perform a manoeuvre, for example a hover, increases as density 
altitude28 or weight increases.  There is a point where the power required exceeds the power 
available.  This will determine how an approach is flown and a landing made. For example, 
there may be insufficient power available to terminate in a high or 'out of ground effect '29 
hover.  The pilot may therefore have to terminate in a low or 'in ground effect' hover , or land 
without hovering at all.  This is discussed in more detail in section  4.3. 
4.2.5.  The pilot needed to know  the total weight of the helicopter and to confirm t hat it had the 
performance capability to land at the site.  He also needed to assess the wind and 
temperature as accurately  as possible .  The variable light wind and obscured marker flag 
made it difficult initially for the pilot to choose the best approach  direction.  
4.2.6.  The pilot said that a s the helicopter was approaching to land , he had detected a slight sink  
that put the helicopter  below his intended approach path.  He  had raised the collective lever  
slightly  to increase the rotor thrust in an attempt to regain the desired approach profile.  The 
pilot had then decided that he could not achieve the landing site so he  had turned the 
helicopter to the left, his planned escape path , to fly away from the high groun d and down the 
northern face of the mountain.  However, the pilot said the  rate of descent  had then  
increased rapidly and unexpectedly . 
4.2.7.  The helicopter struck the steep slope heavily in a nose -down attitude.  The right skid 
collapsed under the force of the impact and the belly of the helicopter struck the slope.  The 
markings made in the snow indicated that this was likely followed by the tail rotor guard 
hitting the ground and the helicopter pitching forward.  When the main rotor struck the slope 
this cause d the helicopter to roll down the slope.  Five of t he occupants were thrown from  the 
helicopter as it rolled 300 m down the mountain.   
                                                        
 
26 Direction viewed from above.  
27 Because the main rotor rotates clockwise, the fuselage reacts by wanting to rotate anticlockwise.  Right 
pedal input is therefore required to counter this torque effect and keep the helicopter straight, which requires 
additi onal engine power.   
28 The pressure altitude corrected for any temperature difference from the temperature at that altitude in the 
International Standard Atmosphere.  
29 A helicopter is 'in ground effect' when the downwash from the main rotor strikes the sur face, stopping the 
downward wash and generating an increase in pressure, effectively a cushion of air that reduces the power 
required to maintain position.  The effect reduces as the helicopter moves higher, meaning more power will 
be required.  At a heigh t equivalent to the distance of half to one rotor diameter, the effect is considered to 
be nil and the helicopter is said to be 'out of ground effect'.

 4.3. Factors affecting the flight path  
Sinking air  
4.3.1.  It is unlikely that the helicopter encountered sinking air on the approach  to land .  There was 
little or no wind reported and therefore neither turbulence nor downdraughts were considered 
to have been a contributing factor.   However, variable wind conditions can be encountered in 
the mountain s.  Therefore,  the possibility of the  helicopter encountering downdraughts or 
sinking air could not be totally excluded.  
4.3.2.  In calm, sunny conditions, differential heating causes updraughts.  A steep slope exposed to 
the sun will heat up more than one that is not similarly exposed.  The heated a ir adjacent to 
the slope rises and generates an upslope wind called an anabatic wind.  Local paragliding 
pilots interviewed for the investigation advised that even in winter they had experienced 
anabatic wind off snow -covered slope s.  The wind would normal ly be light in strength and 
would quickly dissipate as the afternoon progressed.  
4.3.3.  At the time of the accident the northern slopes of Mount Alta would have been facing directly 
towards the sun.  The approach was being made from the side of the northern slope of Mount 
Alta, making it more likely that the air mass would be rising up the sl ope over which the pilot 
had chosen his escape path.  On the approach to land the helicopter was unlikely to have  
encountered sinking air.  
Engine performance  
4.3.4.  The possibility of a sudden power loss was examined in detail and discounted as a cause of 
the acc ident for a number of reasons. First, the pilot said there had been no power loss or 
engine problem and neither the pilot nor the guide, who was also on headset and familiar 
with helicopters, reported seeing or hearing any low engine or rotor RPM (revoluti ons per 
minute) warning indications.30  This was supported by other witnesses who indicated that the 
helicopter had been performing normally as it approached the intended landing area.  
4.3.5.  Secondly, rotor strike marks on the slope and the damage to the main rot or blades and 
Starflex main rotor head were consistent with the blades rotating at high speed when they 
struck the slope.  They were also consistent with the main rotor being driven by the engine 
when it struck the slope.  Thirdly, the witness marks on the  engine's fifth -stage module 
confirmed that the engine had been delivering power and , given the degree of misalignment, 
probably high power, at the time the helicopter struck the slope.  Fourthly, the scoring marks 
on the inside of the coupling tube showed that the engine had still been driving the main rotor 
transmission as the helicopter  tumbl ed down the hillside.  Finally, there was no pre -existing 
fault found and the damage sustained by the engine was consistent with the impact 
sequence.   
  
                                                        
 
30 A constant aural warning horn and associated warning light will activate when main rotor RPM reduces 
below the normal operating range.  A sudden engine failure will also result in a sudden yawing of the 
helicopter and a range of other instrument warning indications.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 Weight and balance  
Safety issue - the operator's standard operating procedures did not require i ts pilots to 
routinely calculat e the performance capabilit ies of their helicopters for the intended flights . 
Safety  issue - there was a  risk of not knowing an aircraft's capability when using standard 
passenger weights , and therefore of pilots  operating close to the limits of the ir aircraft's 
performance . 
4.3.6.  The Commission determined that at the time of the accident the helicopter was over its 
maximum permi tted weight  by approximately 3 0 kg, and the longitudinal centre of gravity for 
the helicopter was about  3.0 centimetres (cm) forward of the limit.  
4.3.7.  To ensure that an aircraft is flown within its design limits, Civil Aviation Rule 135.303 requires 
an operator to establish the weight of the c rew, passengers and baggage or goods for each 
flight (CAA, 2007).  A weight and balance check is to be completed to determine an aircraft 's 
weight and centre of gravity for the flight, and to provide a basis for performance calculations.  
The weight of the  passengers can be determined using one of three options:  
1. The operator conducts a survey to establish a standard passenger weight.  
2. The operator uses a passenger's declared weight with 4 kg added  to allow for the 
tendency of people to underestimate their we ight. 
3. The operator weighs each passenger.  
4.3.8.  The CAA issued an Advisory Circular (CAA, 2005) detailing the procedure an operator had to 
undertake in order to establish a standard passenger weight.  The operator had undertaken a 
passenger weight survey in 2010 , which resulted in an average passenger weight of 76.57 
kg.  This was rounded up to 80 kg to provide a more conservative and easier -to-use figure.  
The standard passenger weight of 80 kg was used for calculating helicopter weight and 
balance for most (tou rist) trips.  
4.3.9.  The Advisory Circular made the point that "there is no relief provided in the C ivil Aviation  
Rules  for an aircraft to operate overweight when using standard passenger weights ".  Civil 
Aviation  Rules also require air operators to adhere to the limitations set by the aircraft 
manufacturers.  
4.3.10.  For weight and balance calculations, the operator's pilots could  use the weight and balance 
calculator ,31 which included the details  for each helicopter , or use the operator's standard 
loading plan.  However, the helicopter was new to the fleet and this was the first day the 
operator had used it for  commercial operations .  The operator had not yet entered the  
helicopter's  weight and balance details into the calculator database.   This would have been  
unlikely to make  any difference on the day of this accident because t he operator's pilots 
normally used the standard loading configuration based on standard passenger weights 
instead.  Nevertheless, the weight and balance details should have been loaded into the 
calcu lator to allow the pilot the option of using it , particularly as the helicopter was new to the 
fleet . 
4.3.11.  The operator's procedures contained within its exposition32 stated that: "A Weight & Balance 
Calculation is NOT required for any flight that is loaded in c ompliance with a standard loading 
plan authorised by Ops Procedures 9. 1".  The standard loading plan form  described a range  
of passenger combinations  and guidance information.  For example, w hen there were two 
people in the dual front seat  the form stated , "the smallest person of all the passengers 
                                                        
 
31 A computer program usable for all of the operator's helicopters.  A pilot or designated person would enter 
the weight of each seat occupant, the fuel load and any cargo to determine the helicopter's all -up weight and 
centre -of-gravity position.  Alerts would be generated if the program calculated that the helicopter was 
outside any flight man ual weight and balance limit.  
32 The Helicopter Line Operations Manual 9.1, dated June 2014.  
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005

 present should be located in the inboard position ".  This would help to ensure that : any weight 
limit for the dual front seat was not exceeded ; the helicopter's centre of gravity was within 
allowable limits ; and the passenger's right arm was less likely to interfere with the pilot's use 
of the collective lever located between the two seats.33  The surveyed exposition weight of 80 
kg was to be used for each adult, with lesser weights used  for children and infants.   
4.3.12.  The standard loading plan applied to the majority of the operator's scenic operations.  For 
specialised activities, such as heli -rafting, heli-biking and heli-skiing, pilots were directed to 
the weight and balance calculator's 'Frequent Unique Activities ' page.34  The page contained 
standard loading configurations , which used a range of assumptions for each of these 
activities.  However, in June 2014, before the commencement of the heli -ski season, the 
operator  had issued an Operations Notice that took precedence.  This notice described the 
standard empty weight configuration for heli -ski flights  and includ ed standard pilot and 
passenger weights  (95 and 80 kg respectively) , 20% fuel load, 4 kg in the boot locker, no  
survival bags ,35 10 kg for empty lunch containers in the boot and the heaviest ski basket 
containing  42 kg of ski equipment, an 8 kg guide pack and 2 kg for other client gear.  
4.3.13.  The Commission calculated the helicopter's take -off weight and balance for the accident trip 
using each of the three options referred to in paragraph 4.3. 7.  A fuel load of 50% (270 litres 
weighing 216 kg) was used for each of the calculations.  This was based on the pilot having 
refuelled the helicopter to nearly 60% before loading group C and flying them to the top of 
Tony's Run, then descending and loading group A.  
4.3.14.  Using standard passenger weights.   In the operator's Operations Notice 261 for heli -skiing the 
following figures are used:  480 kg for the six passenger s, 95 kg for the pilot  and 4 kg for the 
pilot's bag .  For the  lunch  containers, 20 kg was used as the clients had yet to eat lunch .  The 
heaviest  ski basket at 43 kg contain ed a total of 52  kg of ski equipment and bags .  This gave 
a total weight of 2,2 37 kg on the  accident flight, 13 kg less than the maximum allowed 2,250 
kg.  The centre of gravity was calculated to be at the forward limit of 3.210 m . 
4.3.15.  The pilot's u se of declared passenger weights.   For the accident flight the pilot assumed that 
the five passengers weighed an average of 85 kg , which  was based on his observation of the 
group and a discussion with one of the passengers.  The pilot did not add the 4 kg allowance 
that was  required, beca use he thought 85 kg was a good approximation.36  The pilot recalled  
that the weight of the guide had been  78 kg and allowed 95 kg for the ski basket and 
equipment  and 20 kg for the lunches in the baggage compartment.  The pilot had known  his 
own weight to be 80 kg with another 5 kg for his bag.  The take-off weight for these conditions 
had been  calculated as  2,246 kg, 4 kg under the maximum permissible weight , and the 
centre of gravity at the forward limit.   Had the pilot added the mandatory 4 kg to each 
declared passenger weight , he would also have had to reduce the fuel load for each flight in 
order to prevent the helicopter 's weight exceed ing the maximum permissible .  
4.3.16.  Estimated weight.   The weights of the pilot, guide and passengers were obtained throug h 
interviews and medical records.  The ski basket  and contents  were  weighed  soon after the 
accident .  The pilot's weight was stated to be 80 kg .  The  combined  weight of the guide, 
passenger s and their  gear was estimated to be 603 kg. The pilot's bag weighed  5 kg, there 
was 2 kg of gear in the left locker,  and the ski basket weighed  36.5 kg.  The lunches were 
                                                        
 
33 A collective guard also helped to reduce the possibility of interference.  
34 The operator's 'standard operating procedures' for heli -skiing also directed pilots to follow these loading 
procedures.   
35 Survival bags were not carried because all occupants wore warm clothing and there were other helicopters 
in the vicinity that would be able to render immediate assistance.   
36 CAA Advisory Circular AC 119 -4 direct ed operators to determine a more indicative weight when a 
passenger's weight was "clearly greater than the exposition or standard weight ".  "The term 'clearly greater ' 
refers to a passenger whose weight can be readily assessed as being over the applicable expo sition or 
standard weight. "  To help describe this , the Advisory Circular used the example of a person being 34 kg over 
the standard weight, while for a person who weighed "less than 110 kg, the term 'clearly greater than ' is not 
applicable and a more indicative weight is not necessary ".   

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 estimated to weigh 20 kg.  With an estimated fuel load of 216 kg, the total weight of the 
helicopter at the start of the accident flight was estimated to have been 2,289.5 kg (about 39 
kg more than the maximum permi tted).  At th is weight, and using the known seating positions, 
the centre of gravity was determined to be up to 0.030 m (3.0 cm) ahead  of the forward limit  
(see Appendix 3).  The lateral  centre of gravity was determined to be within  the maximum 
permissible limits for each of the three calculations , at about 7 .1 cm left of centre.  The 
maximum distance allowed was 18 cm. 
4.3.17.  During  the accident some passengers ' ski apparel was  contaminated wit h fuel  and 
subsequently  discarded  by the passengers.  Therefore the Commission weighed a  range of 
commonly used skiing an d snowboarding apparel  and used these weights in its calculations .  
An allowance  was added for personal items such as cameras, cell phones , snacks and water .  
4.3.18.  Allowing  for about  9 kg of fuel used in the  climb up Mount Alta, the weight of the helicopter as 
it approached the landing site was estimated to have been 2,280 kg, which would have been  
30 kg over the maximum permitted weight . 
4.3.19.  Civil Aviation Rules allow t he use of standard passenger weights , in recognition  that it is not 
always  practical for all helicopter operations  to physically weigh every passenger carried .  
However, the rules are explicit that no aircraft  should be flown outside permissible weight and 
balance limits, regardless of the method used  to calculate weight and balance . 
4.3.20.  Heli-skiing is considered one of the riskiest type s of helicopter passenger operation.  It is 
conducted at high altitude in mount ainous terrain, with the  additional challenges that pilots 
face when landing in snow.  Also, the helicopters are often being operat ed with loads  that 
place them  at the margins of their performance capabilities . 
4.3.21.  It is not difficult to weigh every passen ger who is undertaking heli -skiing.  Every passenger 
passes through some point  where this could occur .  It is also not difficult to provide pilots with 
devices that enabl e them to calculate  accurately  the weight and balance of their helicopter s 
at any time  in the field should that be required . 
4.3.22.  There was considerable risk in an operator using a standard loading configuration  that 
assumed standard passenger weights for heli -skiing operations , particularly when two 
passengers were to occupy the dual front seat in the Squirrel helicopter .  In this case the use 
of a standard loading configuration and weights was not appropriate  because  the passengers 
could be loaded in such a way that the helicopter  was outside its weight and balance lim its. 
This had been the situation for some time and was not recorded in  CAA audits or the 
operator's own quality assurance processes .  The same would have applied to any Squirrel 
helicopter similarly configured and loaded using standard weights.  
4.3.23.  The pilot  attempt ed to  manag e the loading of his helicopter after he left the base.  However, 
he had no means of weigh ing the passengers.  H aving changed his weight calculation from 
using a standard loading plan to using  assessed weights, he was required to include  the 
additional 4 kg for each passenger .  Had he done so, he could have reduced his fuel load to 
keep the helicopter below the maximum all -up weight.  However, it was never going to be 
possible for him to  calculate the helicopter's longitudinal centre of g ravity  accurately without 
the aid of a weight and balance calculator.   The risk of inadvertently exceeding the limits was  
therefore  high.

 Helicopter performance  
4.3.24.  The need for pilots to understand the performance capabilit ies of their aircraft is well known.  
The CAA comments  in its Helicopter Performance  publication : 
Take -off, landing and hovering are all potentially risky phases of helicopter flight.  
The more that we can do as pilots to minimise these risks - especially when  
operating at high gross weights, from challenging sites, with high density altitudes - 
the safer we will be . 
Most performance -related accidents can be prevented, provided that the pilot 
maintains a good awareness of the surrounding conditions, knows the p erformance 
limitations of the helicopter, always does a power check before committing to a 
marginal situation, and is disciplined enough to "give it away early" if the odds are 
stacking up against getting the job done safely  (CAA, 2012, p. 33) . 
4.3.25.  To determine accurately an aircraft's performance capability, it is necessary to know the total 
aircraft weight, the pressure altitude37 and the air temperature  before the intended take -off 
and landing .  The pilot recognised that the helicopter would be heavy, but he did not estimate 
the total weight accurately.  Therefore  he would not have known accurately the combined 
effect of the total weight, the air temperature and the pressure  altitude.  The pilot  noted that 
at some point the outside air temperature gauge in the helicopter was reading about 0ºC.38  
4.3.26.  A landing onto a site like that on Mount Alta is usually made after a steady descent , the 
steepness of which  depend s on the excess power available and the wind strength.  The 
excess power, or power margin, decreases with increasing altitude or weight.  It is good 
practice to check the power required before landing by  flying at minimum power speed when 
in the vicinity of the landing si te.  However, t he pilot did not check the power until he was on 
the final approach  to the landing site .  He c onsidered  that the power being demanded at that 
point was not "excessively high" for the conditions . 
4.3.27.  A pinnacle landing site such as  Mount Alta would  not offer the benefit of a true ground 
effect ,39 because the ground would slope away too steeply in all directions.  Therefore 
operations at such a site should be planned on the basis of landing from an out -of-ground -
effect hover, which requires more power.  
4.3.28.  The helicopter flight manual performance charts showed that at the maximum permissible 
weight of 2,250 kg and an air temperature of 0ºC the helicopter had an out-of-ground -effect 
hover capability of up to 7,750 feet and an in-ground -effect hover ca pability of up to 9,500 
feet.  The charts also showed that the maximum altitude for an out -of-ground effect hover at 
the estimated  weight of 2,280 kg was about 7,300 feet.  T he altitude of the landing site was 
7,545 feet . 
4.3.29.  The performance charts were conservative, in that they  assum ed an engine that met  the 
minimum guaranteed p erformance .  The operator reported that the engine had been  
performing satisfactorily before the accident flight.   Airbus Helicopters advised that the 
operator's most recent engi ne performance data had indicated that the engine was "able to 
supply more than the minimum guaranteed engine power ".  However, the best way for a pilot 
to assess the likely capability was to check the power margin before landing .   
4.3.30.  The topography of the landing site was such that there would have been some ground effect 
available only if the  helicopter had reach ed the chosen landing site.  Helicopter performance 
                                                        
 
37 The altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere with the same pressure as the part of the 
atmosphere in question.      
38 0ºC was used in the following performance calculations.  
39 When hovering close to the ground, the ground acts as a cushion and reduces the p ower required to 
maintain position.  Moving higher reduces the effect of the cushioning , and the power required increases 
until about the equivalent of half of the rotor diamet er, when the effect is considered to be nil.   

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 charts indicated that there was a sufficient power margin available for an in-ground -effect 
hover at weights up to about 2,450 kg.  
4.3.31.  BEA (and Airbus Helicopters) advised that at the calculated centre of gravity, "the pilot would 
not have been able to observe  that he was outside the flight envelope defined by the flight 
manual ".  In other words, the position of the centre of gravity was not so extreme that a pilot 
would have noticed, and they would have had no difficulty controlling the helicopter.  A 
forward centre of gravity would assist a pilot to move forward or accelerate t he helicopter, 
provided there was sufficient terrain clearance to do so.  
4.3.32.  Before departing on the flight to the top of Mount Alta, the helicopter was over its maximum 
allowable weight by 39 kg.  It was also forward of it s centre of gravity limit by about  3.0 cm.  
The pilot said that the performance of the helicopter on lifting from the staging area, landing 
at the top of Tony's Run and uplifting group A from the bottom of Tony's Run , had been as 
expected and he had had no problem controlling the helicopter.40  The landing site at the top 
of Tony's Run was about 140 m lower than the Mount Alta landing site.   
4.3.33.  The first sign that the helicopter was not performing as the pilot expected was the unexpected 
slight sink  when approaching the landing site.  The pilot said that as he got close to the 
landing site he had been  focused outside the helicopter , managing the approach p ath, and 
had not paid close attention to the airspeed or power demand .  He had noticed that he was 
demanding about 90% of the normal operating range  before the sink occurred , after which he 
had immediately initiated his escape manoeuvre.  The guide  recalled  that the helicopter had 
"almost stopped " before it turned away to the left.  It was very likely that the helicopter's 
speed had red uced below that for translational41 lift and the power requirement was 
increasing with further speed reduction.  
4.3.34.  It is very unlikely that the helicopter entered into ground effect , because when the pilot turned 
the helicopter left it  had not reached the landing site and was moving over  ground that sloped 
steep ly away .  Therefore it was very likely that the helicopter had been  approaching an out -of-
ground -effect hover, and it may not have had sufficient performance to achieve that, even if 
the pilot ha d demanded all available power.  
4.3.35.  The last recollection the pilot had of the power he was demanding was about  90% of normal 
torque , which  he observed before he abandoned the approach.  It was unclear from the 
evidence whether the pilot increased the  power  demand after that , but the performance 
graphs indicate d that there may not have been sufficient power anyway.  The distance f rom 
the intended landing site to the first point of impact was 20 m vertically and 47  m 
horizontally.  If the helicopter was already operating beyond its performance capabilities and 
descending, any banked turn would have increased the rate of descent.  The greater the 
angle of bank , the greater the effect.  It is unclear whether the helicopter gained sufficient 
forward speed  to achieve translation al lift before striking  the slope.    
Vortex ring state  
4.3.36.  The previous section s have described how the approach was flown when the  helicopter was 
operating above  the limit of its performance  capability , which  resulted in a sink rate 
developing before it reached the landing site.  The initial sink rate was very unlikely to have 
been high, but occurred close enough and low enough to the terrain for the pilot to make  a 
deliberate turn in the direction of his plan ned escape path .   
                                                        
 
40 Controllability and the e stimated performance are checked against the amount of power being used 
(weight) and cyclic control (centre of gravity).  
41 Translation is the phase of flight when accelerating from a  hover to forward flight or back to a hover  
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005 
<< Page 27 >>
 4.3.37.  The pilot reported that an unexpected increase in the rate of descent had developed as he 
initiated his escape manoeuvre.  V ortex ring state42 is a phenomenon that can cause an 
increased and rapid rate of descent, so consideration was given to whether it could have 
been a factor at some point in the accident sequence .  Vortex ring state  occurs when a 
helicopter is descending in its own downwash at a very low airspeed and a moderately high 
rate of descent.  Any increase in power increases t he downwash and results in the helicopter 
descending faster.   Further information on vortex ring state is given in Appendix 4. 
4.3.38.  The pilot could not recall any of the symptoms  of incipient or established vortex ring state  as 
having occurred at any time during the accident  sequence .  Possible reasons are that the 
AS350 main rotor design has an anti -vibration feature that could have masked the onset of 
buffet.  If they were present, any  symptoms m ight have been assumed to be associated with 
the he licopter accelerating  through translation as the helicopter dived away . 
4.3.39.  The pilot initially assessed the wind at Mount Alta as almost calm or possibly from the south, 
so he approach ed towards the  south into the anticipated  wind.  However, during th at 
appro ach he could not be sure of the wind direction, so he turned and made a n approach 
from the south , heading north.  When he and the guide saw the wind indicator , he was 
satisfied that any wind was  light and from the south , which was consistent with the aviation 
forecast for the area .  It was unlikely that  there was a  northerly wind blowing over the landing 
area .  
4.3.40.  As mentioned above , a moderate rate of de scent through the air is one of the factors that can 
induce vortex ring state.  If a helicopter is des cending th rough updra ughting air it will need a 
lesser rate of descent relative to the ground before it encounters vortex ring state.  The sun 
was shining on the northern -facing slope area over which the helicopter was approaching to 
land.  Therefore  it was possible that a light anabatic wind was blowing up the side of the 
mountain .   
4.3.41.  Airbus Helicopters stated that the helicopter under the accident conditions  would not 
generally enter vortex ring state unless the rate of descent was in the order of 900 fe et per 
minute.43  The pilot said he  had commenc ed the escape manoeuvre immediately after the 
aircraft had begun a slight sink and not respond ed to the small increase in power  he had 
applied .  Therefore it was very unlikely that the helicopter would have encountered vortex ring 
state on the approach.  
4.3.42.  During the escape manoeuvre the pilot turned the helicopter left through about 90º.  The 
heading change would have altered the relative direction of any wind that was present, but as 
the strength of the prevai ling wind and any anabatic flow were both likely to have been light, 
their effect on the outcome of the manoeuvre was likely minimal.  
4.3.43.  When t he pilot turned the helicopter and flew it down the slope, i t was likely that the airspeed 
increased as a result, which would generally  have  cause d the helicopter to exit from the 
'envelope' in which vortex ring state could be encountered.44 
4.3.44.  When the helicopter was banked during the latter part of  the escape manoeuvre, the vertical 
component of the rotor thrust would h ave decreased.  The vertical  component balances the 
weight  of the helicopter , so any  reduction in that component will cause any rate of descent to 
increase .  Also, the pilot was actively trying to fly the helicopter down his intended escape 
path .  
                                                        
 
42 Sometimes called 'settling with power', the term 'vortex ring state ' is used in this report to avoid any 
confusion with 'over -pitching' and 'power settling', where a helicopter may have insufficient power to 
maintain a hover and subsequently settles onto the surface.  
43 A rate of descent of 300 feet per minute is often quoted as the upper limit in order to avoid approaching 
vortex ring state  (FAA, 2012).   The actual rate of descent depends on the specific helic opter type . 
44 Airbus confirmed that at the weight estimated for the flight, the vortex ring state envelope was bounded by 
an airspeed less than 20 k nots and an existing rate of descent of more than 900 feet per minute.    

<< Page 28 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 4.3.45.  The pilot said he was aware of the conditions required to enter vortex ring state , the 
characteristics of vortex ring state , and how to exit it.  He had therefore  been  surprised by the 
helicopter's behaviour.  
4.3.46.  The distance f rom the intended landing site to the first point of impact was only 20 m 
vertically and 47 m horizontally.  The pilot estimated  that the helicopter had been  close to and 
about 3 m higher than the landing site when he initiated his escape manoeuvre.  The 
helicopter was already sinking  at that point.  It is feasible that his perception of a rapid rate of 
descent was e xplained by any increase in the rate brought about by his manoeuvring the 
helicopter , and because  he was closing with the ridgeline to the right of his intended escape 
path, which w as where the helicopter first struck .  
4.3.47.  Based on the above analysis,  it is unlikely that vortex ring state was a significant contributing 
factor to the accident.  However, the description of the helicopter's flight path  in the seconds 
before the collision  was deduced from the recollection of the people involved, and could not  
be wholly substantiated by physical evidence .  It could therefore not be ruled out that the 
helicopter was affected to some degree by vortex ring state at some stage as the pilot carr ied 
out his escape manoeuvre.  
Summary  
4.3.48.  The accident highlight ed the importance of pilots ' pre-flight planning to ensure  that 
helicopter s will have sufficient performance to conduct intended flight s safely.  It also 
highlight ed the importance of pilots checking the performance capabilit ies of helicopter s 
while in flight.  
4.3.49.  The flight manual performance charts  showed that at a weight of 2,28 0 kg the helicopter 
could not have achieve d an out -of-ground -effect hover at the altitude of  the landing site and 
in an air temperature of 0 ºC.   
4.3.50.  The evidence show ed that it was very likely the helicopter began an uncommanded descent 
during the final phase of the landing , because it was approaching  an out -of-ground hover with 
minimal  performance capability to hover  at that weight, altitude and temperature.  The 
descent continued as the pilot executed his escape manoeuvre, likely exacerbated by the 
helicopter banking as the pilot turned it away from the landing site.  Although vortex r ing state 
could not be ruled out as having contributed to the helicopter's rate of descent in the 
moments before impact, this was considered unlikely . 
4.3.51.  Heli-ski operations are a high -risk activity.  The risk is too high to be relying on  standard 
loading pla ns with assumed standard passenger weights , when relatively small variations 
from the standards can put a helicopter outside its published maximum performance 
capability.  In addition,  pilots should not rely on ground effect to make successful landing s in 
confined or high -risk area s. 
4.3.52.  The operator has since amended its procedures to require  a calculation of the actual weight 
and balance for every flight.  Flexibility is provided for remote operations , where mobile 
devices  and declared weights plus 6 kg can be used.  
Findings  
1. The helicopter struck the face of the mountain heavily in a nose -down attitude 
with a high rate of descent.  
2. The engine was almost certainly operating normally and delivering a high level 
of power when t he accident occurred . 
3. The helicopter was loaded by an estimated  30 kilograms  over the maximum 
permitted weight of 2,250 kilograms , with its longitudinal centre of gravity an 
estimated up to 3.0 centimetres  forward of the maximum permissible limit 
when the accident occurred.   
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005 
<< Page 29 >>
 4. The helicopter's weight and the altitude at which it was being flown meant that 
it was operating at or close to the performance limit for  an out -ground -effect 
hover .  It is likely that the initial sink on the landing approach was a result of 
the helicopter moving into an out -of-ground -effect hover as the airspeed 
reduced . 
5. It is unlikely that vortex ring state was a significant factor contributing to the 
accident.  How ever, it could not be ruled out that the helicopter was affected to 
some degree by vortex ring state at some stage as the pilot carried out his 
escape manoeuvre . 
6. The use of  standard loading plans for Squirrel helicopter s fitted with dual front 
seats  was in appropriate , in that it was possible for pilots and ground staff to 
follow the plans and operate the helicopter s outside their  permissible limits.  
7. The use of standard loading configurations  that use standard passenger 
weights should not be permitted when aircraft are fully loaded and operating 
close to permissible limits . 
4.4. The operator 's training policies and procedures  
4.4.1.  The operator was one of the largest helicopter operators in New Zealand , with extensive 
experience of flying in the mountains around Queenstown  and Wanaka and further afield.  
The operator's pilots were experienced in this environment, with nearly all having more than 
3,000 hours of flying helicopters.  The pilot of the helic opter  involved in this accident had 
more than 4,000 hours.  
4.4.2.  The CAA, as part of its audit programme, had routinely audited the operator with no major 
concerns identified.  A more thorough five -yearly recertification audit had been undertaken in 
July 2013, 13 months before the accident.  That audit report  had made n o serious adverse 
findings and had been  overall complimentary about  the operator and management. In 
addition, while some adverse findings were made in audits of some of the operator's bases  in 
2014 , the CAA did not consider it necessary to alter the operator's audit programme, and the 
operator remained in the CAA's  lowest risk assessment band.    
4.4.3.  The operator's induction, training and competency programmes were tailored to alpine  
operations .  For example,  new pilot s were not allowed to make their first landing s at remote 
mountain site s.  These had to be undertaken by more qualified , senior pilot s, who would 
assess the landing site s and ensure that wind marker s were available.  The syllabus for this 
qualifi cation included subjects such as in -ground -effect and out -of-ground -effect approaches, 
escape routes, performance considerations and vortex ring state "assessment and recovery 
technique ". Following the M ount Alta accident, the operator reviewed its managem ent, 
supervision and training structure, resulting in a new management position and change of 
responsibilities and personnel.  
4.4.4.  The operator considered heli -skiing to be a specialised task to be undertaken by a restricted 
number of pilots only.  The operator  had written a standard operating procedure titled Heli -ski 
& Heli -hike Operations, which detailed the requirements, planning and procedures to be 
followed.  
4.4.5.  Pilots nominated for heli -skiing were required to undergo specific training and obtain approval 
before commencing any heli -skiing flights.  The training and assessment syllabus for heli -
skiing included a range of oral briefings and air exercises.  Once a pilot was approved for heli -
skiing operations , the operator continued to provide supervision through  more senior pilots 
and through feedback from experienced guides.  Guides were not allocated to one pilot and 
could therefore compare their performance as the heli -skiing season progressed.  
4.4.6.  The operator's general manager aviation commented that the risk of  vortex ring state was 
greater when flying in the mountains because of the variable conditions likely to be 
encountered , and because the terrain often necessitated a steep or downwind approach.  The 
operator's training programme addressed this risk by requ iring its pilots to undertake flight 

<< Page 30 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 instruction on vortex ring state.  The manager commented that they demonstrated vortex ring 
state in mountainous terrain , which made the rapid vertical acceleration and the height loss 
during recovery very apparent.  
The pilot's training  
4.4.7.  The pilot had been with the operator for nearly four years before he was considered for heli -
skiing.  He had been assessed in 2011, but the operator had considered  that he required 
more dedicated heli -ski training  and experience , so he had been held over until the following 
year. He had begun his dedicated heli -ski training  in June 2012.  Some areas for 
improvement had been identified, but these had later  been  signed off as being addressed 
before the pilot was allowed to begin heli -skiing operations under supervision .  He had then 
completed two seasons without incident and was considered competent in this role.  Neither 
the operator nor the guides spoken to had  any safety concerns about his performance as a 
heli-ski pilot.  
4.4.8.  The pilot said he considered his training to have equipped him well for the role of a heli -ski 
pilot.  Although the operator had been satisfied that the pilot was ready to become a Category 
A pilot (unrestricted), it would have been good practice for him to undergo a specific heli -ski 
assessment flight  for what is acknowledged as a high -risk operation.   The results of such a  
flight should have been  included  in his training record.  
4.4.9.  The Commissio n investigated an accident involving another of the operator's helicopters near 
Mount Tyndall in October 2013 (10 months prior to this accident).  Although the 
circumstances of that accident were different, the Commission noted a lack of formal 
recording o f issues relating to that pilot's performance . 
4.4.10.  It is important for operators to keep comprehensive , formal records of all pilot training.  
Historical training records provide the basis for ongoing performance monitoring, particularly 
given natural attritio n as safety and training managers move through the industry . 
4.4.11.  The operator's training policies and procedures received a thorough review in the course of 
this inquiry and that into the Mount Tyndall accident .45  Notwithstanding  the shortcomings in 
training record -keeping  found in both inquiries , the training each pilot  had received was 
broadly comparable with that of other New Zealand operators.  The Commission heard from a 
Canadian expert46 that the training was also broadly com parable with th at given by  Canadian 
heli-ski operators .  Nevertheless , this operator experienced three  serious landing accidents 
within three years.  
4.4.12.  The CAA  had raised no recent adverse findings against the operator's policies and procedures 
for training i ts pilots prior to these three accidents . 
Finding s 
8. The operator's policies and procedures for training its pilots were broadly 
comparable to those of other New Zealand operat ors and to those of heli -ski 
operators in Canada . 
9. The pilot was trained  in accordance with the operator's training standards  and 
was experienced in heli-ski operations.  
 
                                                        
 
45 See footnote 21.  
46 The expert had a long association with heli -skiing operations in Canada as a helicopter pilot, a regulator 
and an independent accident investigator .

 4.5. A potential sector -wide safety issue  
4.5.1.  New Zealand's helicopter accident rate is higher than that of other aviation sectors.47  There 
has been public  criticism of how helicopters are operated in New Zealand, including a culture 
of operating outside the manufacturers' published and placarded 'never exceed' limitations .  
Should this situation exist, there is a possibility that such a culture has become n ormalised.  
The core safety issue would therefore lie within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on 
effects to individual operators' safety systems.  
4.5.2.  The Commission's inquiries have not fully explored this potential wider issue.  However, the 
Commission is aware that the CAA is undertaking a review of the helicopter sector risk profile, 
and has recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation include the issue of operational 
culture in that review.   
Finding  
10. There are indications that a culture exists among some helicopter pilots  in New 
Zealand  of operating their aircraft beyond  the published and placarded limits.  
Such a culture adversely  affects  the safety performance of the helicopter 
sector.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 4.6. Survival  
Injuries  
4.6.1.  The injuries sustained by the deceas ed passenger were consistent with his having been 
struck by the broken right skid (see Figure 6), and being ejected from  the helicopter and 
caught between it and the snow -covered slope as the helicopter came to rest.  His injuries 
were unsurvivable. Three of the surviving occupants sustained serious injuries, including 
fractures, internal injuries and extensive bruising.  The remaining three occupants sustaine d 
minor to moderate injuries, predominantly extensive bruising and sprains.  
Safety briefing  
4.6.2.  As discussed in section 3.1, the briefing of passengers involved in heli -skiing was normally 
conducted in two separate briefings.  The first briefing was a general helicopter safety briefing 
given to passengers before commencing flying.  The second briefing concerned activities 
while skiing, for example avalanches and snow survival, and was normally given just prior to 
commencing heli -skiing.  
4.6.3.  The content of the first  briefing, which was detailed in the heli -skiing standard operating 
procedure, included  (among other things ) how to approach and depart the helicopter, no -go 
areas and emergency equipment carried on board.  The operation of seatbelts was to be 
discussed, w ith a requirement to ensure that the belts were fastened throughout the flight.  
There was, however, no mention of how tight the seatbelts were to be and this aspect was not 
raised during the briefing of any of the groups on the day of the accident.   
Seat belts  
4.6.4.  The seats and seatbelts fitted to the helicopter were of the usual type fitted to AS350 
helicopters and conformed with internationally agreed technical standards.48  However, the 
force experienced in the impact exceeded the design capability of the he licopter, its seats and 
likely also the seatbelts.49  Of the seven persons on board, two were retained in their seats 
and five were ejected from the helicopter, either during the initial impact or as the helicopter 
rolled down the mountain.  The following s ection reviews the accident sequence in terms of 
survivability and explains why two  people  were retained in their seats and five were not.  
Figure 6 and Table 1 describe the occupants' seat positions, seatbelt status and injuries.

49 The designed maximum loading for the seats was 6 g (longit udinal), 2  g (lateral) and 6  g (vertical).  The 
seatbelts were approved to 10  g (longitudinal).

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 4.6.5.  The two passengers who remained in their seats (positions B and F) were positioned about 
the centreline of the helicopter.  Therefore  as the helicopter rolled they would not have been 
subjected to the same centrifugal forces as those seated further outboar d.  Other factors that 
might explain why they were not ejected from the helicopter  are discussed below .  
4.6.6.  The three front seats (positions A, B and C) were all equipped with four -point harnesses - a 
lap belt and two shoulder straps.  The outboard lap belt a ttachment fitting for seat C  broke .  
Despite the seatbelt remaining buckled, the broken attachment effectively released the 
seatbelt and allowed the guide to be thrown out.  
4.6.7.  The pilot recalled tightening his seatbelt firmly before the flight and the latch r emained 
buckled during the accident sequence.  The forward section of the cabin floor was bent 
upwards when the nose of the helicopter struck the slope, probably after being pitched 
forward from the initial impact.  It was therefore almost impossible for h im to have 
'submarined'50 down and forwards out of his lap belt.  It is more likely that he was pulled 
upward between the two shoulder straps and the broken seat back.  The occupant in seat B 
was retained in his seat.  
4.6.8.  The four rear seats (positions D, E, F and G) were each fitted with a three -point harness 
comprising a lap belt and single shoulder harness.  The person in seat F, directly behind seat 
B, was retained in his seat.  The person to his right, in seat E, was thrown clear of the rolling 
helicopter d espite his seatbelt remaining buckled.  Both lap belt connections for this 
passenger were found to be nearly fully extended.  This would have given a very loose fit 
around the waist and, like the pilot, he most likely slipped up through his lap belt.  
4.6.9.  The s eatbelts for seats D and G were found to be released and both persons had been 
ejected from the helicopter as it rolled down the mountain.  Although it was possible that the 
buckles were deliberately released, it was more likely that something caught the b uckles 
while  the helicopter was  rolling down the slope and released the seatbelts.  The lap belts for 
seats D and G were found at or near full extension, which would have given a very loose fit 
around the waist.  
4.6.10.  The seatbelt catch mechanism was a common d esign found in most passenger aircraft 
around the world.  To release the belt, the lever had to be pulled up nearly 70º.  The lap belts 
being extended would have made it easier for the passengers to locate and fasten them after 
boarding.  However, if a bel t remains loose around the waist the chances of something 
inadvertently catching the semi -guarded release lever increase.  Therefore, after buckling up 
the straps the two lap belts should be pulled as tight as possible to minimise movement in 
the event of an accident.  It also reduces the possibility of the buckle being inadvertently 
released.  Only after landing, and when about to depart the aircraft, should the buckle be 
released.  
4.6.11.  On 20 November 2015 the operator issued a notice to all staff reminding the m that seatbelts 
were to be fitted "snug across the hips ". 
Other means of protection  
4.6.12.  Five of the seven occupants were wearing ski helmets during the flight.  However, this 
appears to have had little influence on survivability in this case.  The two occupants who were 
not wearing helmets survived.  Among the five who were wearing helmets, most had their chin 
straps either loose or undone.  While ski -type helmets are not designed for surviving a 
helicopter crash, in the event of an accident they could provide an additional level of safety, if 
worn properly.  
4.6.13.  The sudden and violent nature of the accident meant that none of the occupants had time to 
adopt a 'brace position' prior to the helicopter striking the slope.  The two occupants who 
                                                        
 
50 'Submarined' is a term used to describe a person being pulled downward by the impact forces, and 
potentially through their still -secure seatbelt.

 remained in the helicopter said that they had curled up as much as possible as it rolled down 
the mountain.  The remaining occupants were either immediately thrown clear or did not think 
to adopt the brace position.  The deceased passenger was wearing upper -torso protecti on, 
similar to that worn by motocross riders.  It was considered very unlikely that this would have 
prevented his adopting the brace position if he had wished or was able to do so.  Wearing 
additional body armour might have reduced the severity of injury d uring the crash.  However, 
it would not have provided any protection against the fatal injuries he received on this 
occasion.  
Emergency response  
4.6.14.  The helicopter was fitted with a 406 -megahertz emergency locator transmitter.  This activated 
as a result of th e impact and at 1251 the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand received 
an initial alert.  The injured guide was able to alert the pilot of another of the operator's 
helicopters within minutes of the accident.  If this had not been done, the guides of the  other 
groups would have raised the alarm when the helicopter did not return when expected.  A 
further back -up was provided by the operator's normal flight -following through its base in 
Queenstown.  
4.6.15.  There were no issues with the speed at which the relevant authorities learned of the accident 
and responded.  
Finding  
11. It is very likely that several of the passengers' seatbelts were not securely 
adjusted.  If seatbelts are loosely fitting, occupants are more likely to be 
ejected from an aircraft and the seatbelt s are more prone to inadvertent 
release during an accident.  
 
  

<< Page 36 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 5. Findings  
5.1. The helicopter struck the face of the mountain heavily in a nose -down attitude with a high rate 
of descent.  
5.2. The engine was almost certainly operating normally and delivering a high level of power when 
the accident occurred . 
5.3. The helicopter was loaded by an estimated 3 0 kilograms  above the maximum permitted 
weight of 2,250 kilograms , with its longitudinal centre of gravity  an estimated  up to  3.0 
centimetres  forward of the maximum permissible limit when the accident occurred.   
5.4. The helicopter's weight and the altitude at which it was being flown meant that it was 
operating at or close to the performance limit for  an out -ground -effect hover.  It is likely that 
the initial sink on the landing approach was a result of the helicopter moving into  an out-of-
ground -effect hover as the airspeed reduced . 
5.5. It is unlikely that vortex ring state was a significant factor contribu ting to the accident.  
However, it could not be ruled out that the helicopter was affected to some degree by vortex 
ring state at some stage as the pilot carried out his escape manoeuvre . 
5.6. The use of  standard loading plans for Squirrel helicopter s fitted with dual front seats was 
inappropriate , in that it was possible for pilots and ground staff to follow the plans and operate 
the helicopter s outside their  permissible limits.  
5.7. The use of standard loading configurations that use standard passenger wei ghts should not 
be permitted when aircraft are fully loaded and operating close to permissible limits.   
5.8. The operator's policies and procedures for training its pilots were broadly comparable to those 
of other New Zealand operators and  to those  of heli -ski operators in Canada.    
5.9. The pilot was trained in accordance with the operator's training standards and was 
experienced in heli -ski operations.  
5.10.  There are indications that a culture exists among some helicopter pilots in New Zealand of 
operating their aircraf t beyond the published and placarded limits.  Such a culture adversely 
affects the safety performance of the helicopter sector.  
5.11.  It is very likely that several of the passengers' seatbelts were not securely adjusted.  If 
seatbelts are loosely fitting, occup ants are more likely to be ejected from an aircraft and the 
seatbelts are more prone to inadvertent ly release during an accident.

 6. Safety actions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety actions addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 20 November 2015 the operator issued a notice to all staff reminding them that "the 
seatbelt must fit snug across the hi ps of passengers during the loading process.  Further, 
harnesses, where fitted, must be worn ". 
Safety actions addressing other safety issues  
6.3. In late 2014 the operator changed its standard pilot weight to 88 kg and amended procedures 
to require pilots to we igh passengers on scenic flights, including heli -skiing operations, when 
departing from base s equipped with weighing equipment.  
6.4. On 27 November 2015 the CAA issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive DCA/AS350/12851 
concerning operating limitations for AS350 h elicopters fitted with two -place front passenger 
seats (see Appendix 5).  A similar directive was issued for operators of AS355 helicopters, the 
twin-engine version of the AS350.  The directive required operators to ensure that the 
helicopter s were  within their weight and balance limits by calculating their longitudinal and 
lateral centre -of-gravity positions, and completing weight and balance data form s.   
 
 
  
                                                        
 
51 The directive was updated to DCA/AS350/128A, effective 14 December 2015 . 

<< Page 38 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any perso n or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been i ssued to the Director of Civil Aviation.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety, it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. Five of the seven occupants were ejected from the helicopter as it tumbled and rolled down 
the mountain.  One was fatally injured and three received serious injuries.  The injuries might 
have been reduced had the passengers'  seatbelts  been fitted  tightly a round their waists.  
Seatbelts can only be effective in preventing or minimising injury if they are fastened and 
properly adjusted.  Aircraft operators must ensure that passengers and crew fasten their 
seatbelts and adjust them to fit tightly across their h ips. 
On 25 October  2017  the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
use the key lessons arising from this report to remind aircraft operators and pilots of the 
importance of ensuring that aircraft occupants fasten and properly adju st their seatbelts at all 
times . (005/17 ) 
On 13 November 20717, Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The CAA will implement the recommendation by way of a Vector article.  We will 
advise  when the article will be published in due course.  
7.4. It is inconclusive to  what extent v ortex ring state  contributed to this accident.  Nevertheless, it  
is a known hazard for helicopters.  To avoid the hazard, pilots must:  
● remain alert to the conditions conducive to the formation of vortex ring state  
● closely monitor the airspeed  and rate of descent during the final approach  
● initiate recovery action at the first indication that they may be approaching vortex ring 
state.  
On 25 October  2017  the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he 
use the key lessons aris ing from this report to remind aircraft operators and pilots of 
helicopter performance and environmental conditions that can lead to vortex ring state, and of 
the need to be alert to the potential for it to occur, even in apparently benign conditions.  
(006/17) 
On 13 November 2017, Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
In a similar manner, the CAA will produce a Vector to remind operators and pilots of  
helicopter performance and environmental conditions that can lead to vortex ring 
state and the potential for i t to occur.  
7.5. New Zealand's helicopter accident rate is higher than that of other aviation sectors.  There has 
been public criticism of how helicopters are operated in New Zealand, including a culture of 
operating outside the manufacturers' published and placarded 'never exceed' limitations.  
Should this situation exist,  there is a possibility that such a  culture has become normalised .  
The core safety issue would therefore lie within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on 
effects to individual operators' safety systems.  
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005 
<< Page 39 >>
 7.6. The Commission is aware that the CAA is currently reviewing t he 'sector risk profil e' of 
commercial helicopter and small aeroplane operations, and that that work will take a 
structured approach to risk identification and mitigation .  
On 25 October 2017  the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation include 
the safety issu e of helicopter operational culture in its current  'sector risk profile' review . 
(032/17)  
  On 13 November 2017, Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
The Part 135 sector risk profile (SRP) published in 2015 identified culture as a risk.  
Over  the next two weeks workshops will confirm the 2015 risks and allocate 
treatment owners.  The CAA will monitor the implementation of the treatments, 
however it must be stressed that it will take some years to convert in the aviation 
sector.

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Flying in mountainous terrain places additional demands on a pilot's skills and an aircraft's 
performance.  Both could be at or near the limits of their capabilities.  Operators need to 
ensure that their safety management systems address the additional ris ks associated with 
flying in such an environment.  
8.2. The use of 'standard' or 'assessed' passenger weights is not a licence to exceed an aircraft's 
permissible weight and balance parameters.  Any aircraft being operated outside the 
permissible range will hav e a higher risk of having an accident, particularly when being 
operated near the margins of aircraft performance capability.  
8.3. It is important for operators to keep comprehensive, formal records of all pilot training.  
Historical training records provide the  basis for ongoing performance monitoring  and 
professional development , particularly given natural attrition as safety and training managers 
move through the industry.  
8.4. Seatbelts are only effective in preventing or minimising injury if they are fastened and  properly 
adjusted.  Aircraft operators must ensure that passengers and crew fasten their seatbelts and 
adjust them to fit tightly across their hips.  
8.5. Vortex ring state is a known hazard for helicopters.  To avoid the hazard, pilots must:  
● remain alert to th e conditions conducive to the formation of vortex ring state  
● closely monitor the airspeed and rate of descent during the final approach  
● initiate recovery action at the first indication that they may be approaching vortex ring 
state.

associated with engine detaching fr om airframe at time of accident.  
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005 
<< Page 43 >>
 Control cables disconnected from FCU, and both throttle and anticipator levers and shafts found to 
operate freely without binding or restrictions.  
1.5 Ignition / Ignitor system  
Summary: The engine ignition system was fou nd to be free of significant defects.  
Engine ignition system found to be present and complete - no detailed inspection or tests conducted as 
items were not in operation in flight .  
Ignitors  
Both ignitors found installed in combustor housing - no defects were visually evident . 
Ignitor box(s)   
High energy ignition units found to be mounted securely and free from external defects. One ignitor 
cable found deformed and detached from associated ignitor plug.  
1.6  Electrical / Power generation   
The starter gene rator was not installed. The mount adapter flange showed signs of damage associated 
with clamp deflection / release .  
Wiring loom and harnesses   
Some damage to electrical loom present in the form of abraded or severed wiring. The loom was 
otherwise complet e and fitted to the engine.  
1.7 Compressor / Gas generator turbine  
Summary: Some damage associated with rotational damage.  
The air path was littered with fine particles considered to originate from the airframe manufacturer 
supplied air intake trunk. The  size and shape of the particles appeared to have been ground by the axial 
compressor and distributed within the engine. Particles were found in the secondary cooling air path 
(inner combustion chamber liner) and noted to have entered the primary combustio n air path. These 
particles appeared to have melted in the engine hot section and deposited on downstream rotating and 
static turbine components.  
No specific tests were conducted to definitively identify the particles , however they bore the 
characteristic s of soft aluminium.  
The axial compressor blades bore signs of high and low energy strike marks and peel back of one blade. 
Not all blades were damaged. Compressor rotated freely and the nose cone showed signs of rotational 
scrape marks.  
No visible damag e to compressor turbine.  
Air intake and bleed valve  
The air intake (airframe supplied bellmouth) was not available for inspection.  
The bleed valve was found intact and securely mounted. Butterfly valve in open (normal) position and 
free to move.  
The bleed valve was further disassembled and a visual inspection did not reveal any apparent defects. 
No further testing of the bleed valve took place.  
Bleed valve filters and jets   
Evidence of white powder deposits on bleed valve finger filter leading to  partial blockage. Bleed valve 
operation considered to be unaffected by deposits.  
Compressor blades / stators / scrolls  
Eleven of the 13 blades suffered impact damage with variable loss of material and significant peel back 
of one blade. Damage attributed  to rotational forces and contact with unknown foreign objects.  
Gas generator turbine52 / NGV / stators  
The gas generator turbine was  intact with no apparent damage other than being coated in a rough layer 
of what appeared to be molten metal particles res ulting in a rough surface finish.  
Molten remnants were found to have coated the first stage gas generator turbine blade trailing edges, 
the second stage NGV and second stage wheel. The first stage NGVs were free from molten particles 
and this was attribut ed to the local temperature resulting in deposits on downstream, cooler operating, 
turbine stages. The coating was not considered to have a detrimental effect on engine operation.  
 
 
                                                        
 
52 Also known as the 'high pressure turbine' in this engine configuration.  

<< Page 44 >>
 Final Report AO -2014 -005 1.8 Power turbine  
The power turbine53 and associated guide vanes were also coated in a molten metal spray / spatter on 
the gas path surfaces. The coating was not considered to have a detrimental effect on engine operation.  
Power turbine blades and stators   
The power turbine was found to rotat e freely and was free from obvious defects other than the presence 
of a molten metal coating spattered on the blade surface. Stators were undamaged and free from major 
defects. Slight rub marks were present on several blades and reflected on the compressor  turbine 
shroud housing.  
1.9 Exhaust system  
The exhaust pipe was found crushed, with strike and deformation damage to the right side. The damage 
was attributed to the engine becoming detached from the airframe in the course of its movement down 
the slope.   
 
1.10  Engine monitoring  
Summary: No significant effects noted.  
All components associated with the engine monitoring system were fitted with the exception of the T4 
junction box that was not supplied with the engine. There was evidence that the junction  box became 
detached in the accident sequence. The T4 loom connecting to the box showed signs of tearing and 
wires had been pulled from connectors.  
Overspeed protection   
N2/NFT drives to FCU found intact and free to rotate. Gear shaft present.  
N1 drive to  FCU intact and consistent with engine operating. Rotated freely.  
Engine speed monitoring   
Both tacho generators found fitted and drive trains free to rotate. Tacho drive shafts intact and tachos 
free to rotate.  
Engine temperature monitoring / indicating  / thermocouples   
All thermocouples present and fitted to Module 3. Leads associated with the T4 junction box damaged 
and damage found consistent with forced removal.  
1.11  Gearboxes, drive train, bearings and cages  
All rotating shafts found to move freel y with no evidence of binding, abnormal noises or unusual play.  
Coking deposits on the compressor turbine rear bearing were considered normal.  
The M05 drive pinion retaining nut witness marks found to be misaligned, indicating that a significant 
torque spike had occurred. The misalignment is consistent with an engine delivering power and the 
drive train suffering from shock loading typically associated with a rotor strike.  
Output drives   
Freewheel unit: The freewheel unit came into contact with the engin e forward support evidenced by 
strike and scrape marks on the inside surface of the housing bellows. Five of the six free wheel unit 
front flange attach bolts were damaged - the heads of the fasteners were sheared off on contact with 
the front support hous ing.  
A run -out check of the free wheel shaft was performed after removal and the 'out of round' amount was 
measured at 1.84  mm. The allowable limit per the Turbomeca Arriel overhaul manual is 0.05  mm. The 
free wheel clutch keys inner race surface of the s haft was found impacted, with corresponding crush 
marks on the clutch keys . 
The tail rotor output shaft flector had failed at the attach flange.  
1.12  Engine externals  
As reported, the engine assembly became detached from the airframe at some point following the 
accident and suffered impact damage to casings, peripheral components, external plumbing and 
electrical loom.  
Plumbing  
The external plumbing was bent and defor med in various places and was attributed to the engine 
release . Casings and shrouds   
The M01 linking tube was deformed in the area of the rear engine mount - the rear mount was not 
available for assessment.  
                                                        
 
53 Also known as the 'free turbine' in this engine configuration.  
 
Final Report AO -2014 -005 
<< Page 45 >>
 The engine front support was missing the forward  mount flange and bore signs of material tearing 
associated with scrape marks provided by contact with the free wheel unit. Signs of power tool use 
(grind marks with local overheating) to free the front support remnants from the forward flange were 
present . 
Slight impact marks were visible on the combustion chamber housing (M03) in the area of the right 
ignitor plug boss.  
The M03 turbine shroud was deformed in several places and required to be cut from the module to 
facilitate removal.  
No penetrating defe cts were evident on the casings and castings of the various modules.  
 
1.13  Other  
Module assemblies: All engine modules were separated from the engine in the course of the engine 
assessment. Other than the damage to the exhaust pipe and M03 turbine shroud  that was required to 
be cut away, all the modules separated without difficulty using the standard or dedicated workshop 
tooling.  
The modules were further disassembled to access areas of interest.  
The power turbine nut was found to be over -torqued provid ing further indication of an engine torque 
spike associated with a main rotor system strike.  
2. Summary and conclusions  
2.1 Summary:  
• The engine assembly was found to be intact, without significant external damage.  
• Impact marks were found on the axial c ompressor blades and the exhaust pipe was crushed.  
• The engine gear train rotated freely with no signs of binding or unusual noise.  
• No significant defects were noted on the available external engine components . 
2.2 Conclusions:  
• It was concluded that the engine was operating and capable of normal operation.  
• The misalignment of the witness marks on the M05 drive pinion nut was indicative of an engine  
   delivering power at the time the helicopter impacted the ridgeline. The m ovement of the pinion nut  
   was associated with a torque spike attributed to power train shock loads generated from a main rotor  
   system strike.  
• The internal air path was littered with metallic particles that were also deposited on hot section 
rotati ng 
   and static components - indicative of an operating engine ingesting abrad ed material .

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 Appendix 2: Confined area - The Seven S 's 
Taken from the Royal New Zealand Air Force's Helicopter Training Syllabus  and the Australian Civil 
Aviation Safety Authority's Helicopter Flight Instructor Manual , Issue 3: March 2012, produced in 
conjunction with the CAA:  
Size.   The size of the area is large enough to safely land, or if need be, winch or 
enable a low hover to load or offload.   There should be sufficient distance from the 
main and tail rotors to allow for sudden or minor movement of the helicopter or 
surrounding vegetation.  
Shape.   The shape of a landing area may determine the final approach direction.  
This ma y also include objects on the landing area, for example people or freight.  
Consideration should also be given to vegetation at the side of the landing area, for 
example trees that may bend in the rotor downwash and alter the shape.  
Surrounds.   Consider th e surrounding obstacles, for example wires, aerials and 
houses.  This may alter the approach and departure directions, and escape route(s).  
The surrounds, along with the size, may also dictate the approach profile, for 
example coming to a high hover befor e descending vertically to land.  
Slope.   The ground is sufficiently level to permit a landing, or will a low hover be 
required.  
Surface.   What is the surface made of?  Dust or snow that may blow up and suddenly 
restrict visibility.  Or small stones and loo se items that may be hazardous if blown 
about.    
Sun.   The position of the sun may restrict visibility by being in the face of the pilot.  It 
may also generate shadows that hide hazards.  
Select the landing point.  Having considered all the above, along with wind strength 
and direction, identify the landing spot.  The combination of these factors will 
determine the approach direction, type of approach, termination, departure direction 
and escape route(s).  The pilot  will then confirm they have a sufficient power margin 
to be able to safely achieve the intended landing.  There may also be decision points 
along the approach that the pilot will use to decide whether to continue or initiate an 
escape.

 Appendix 3: Esti mated weight at start of accident flight  
The table  below  outlines the Commis sion's estimat e of the weight at the start of the accident flight , 
being 2 ,289.5 kg. The fuel used in flying to the landing site would have reduced the total weight by 
about 9  kg. 
The pilot 's and passengers' unclothed weights were obtained through interviews.54 Following the 
accident some passengers ' appare l was contaminated with fuel , discarded and not recovered. The 
Commission therefore had to estimate these weights based on a range of commonly used skiing and 
snowboarding apparel and boots, which were weighed by Commission i nvestigators .

 Final Report AO -2014 -005 Appendix 4: Vortex ri ng state  
When a helicopter is generating rotor thrust or lift, there will be some recirculation of air around the end 
of the blades or rotor disc.55  The recirculation is most pronounced at high power and low airspeed, as 
in a hover, and reduces as the heli copter moves forward.  Vortex ring state occurs when the tip vortex 
becomes more energised and a secondary inner vortex is established towards the centre of the rotor 
disc because the rate of descent exceeds the induced downward flow (see Figures 7 and 8).56

The onset of vortex ring state can be sudden, resulting in the helicopter descending at a very high rate.  
Any increase in rotor thrust in an attempt to reduce the high rate of descent energises the vortices 
further and increases the rate of descent.  Rates of descent of more than 3,000 feet per minute are not 
unusual .  A United States National Transportation Safety Board report into an AS350 -B2 accident cited 
rates of descent between 4,000 feet and 6,000 feet per minute (National Transportation Safety Board, 
2001).  This is significantly faster than the 1,500  to 2,000  feet per minute rate of descent experienced 
in an autorotation following a total power loss.  
The conditions required for the formation of vortex ring state are very limited.  The helicopter needs to 
be under power to generate the downwash that initiates t he tip vortices, and be descending in its own 
downwash to energise the vortices and help establish vortex ring state over the full disc.  The helicopter 
therefore needs to be slow and descending.  Flying in updraughting air may reduce the rate of descent 
required to induce vortex ring state.  
Airspeeds of 10 knots (19 km/hr) or less and a rate of descent of more than 300 feet (90 m) per 
minute57 or more may be required to initiate vortex ring state.  A steep downwind approach is often 
cited as a situation where power, low airspeed and a moderately high rate of descent can combine to 
create vortex ring state.  The entry to vortex ring state is typ ically characterised by a vibration, buffet and 
'twitching' of the fuselage from the turbulent air moving around the fuselage and through the main 
rotors.  Similar but milder characteristics may be observed when moving through translation, which is 
the pha se of flight when accelerating from a hover to forward flight or back to a hover.  
To exit vortex ring state, the direction of the airflow through and around the rotor disc needs to be 
changed.  A pilot can increase forward  airspeed to move clear of the downwash, or enter autorotation, 
                                                        
 
55 The 'rotor disc' is the area enclosed within the circle described by the rotor blade tips.  
56 For further information on vortex ring state, see the references in section 9.    
57 It is noted  that,  for the accident helicopter, Airbus confirme d the rate of descent required to enter vortex 
ring state as being  in excess of 900 feet per minute.

 which stops the air being accelerated down through the disc.58  Both actions will result in a significant 
height loss, more so when entering autorotation.  The most common exit strategy is ther efore to 
accelerate forward and away from the downwash.  All licensed helicopter pilots are taught about vortex 
ring state and how to recover from it.

immediate left lateral cyclic while simultaneously increasing collective and applying right pedal.
