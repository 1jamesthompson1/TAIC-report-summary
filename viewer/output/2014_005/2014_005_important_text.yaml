  \ on the pilot's seventh flight for the day, the fourth heli -skiing flight.  The\
  \ \nprevious three heli -skiing flights had been without incident.  The pilot was\
  \ in good health and \nthere was no indication  of any personal or medical issues\
  \ t hat might have contributed to the \naccident.  \n4.1.2.  The weather conditions\
  \ were suitable for the flight.  \n4.1.3.  The intended landing site was one of\
  \ many in the area used by the operator and could be \napproached from several directions.\
  \  The site was large enough to land up to three \nhelicopters simultaneously if\
  \ required.  The pilot had landed there before.  It was considered \nsuitable for\
  \ the conditions on the day.  \n4.1.4.  The pilot said that he had been unable to\
  \ maintain his intended angle of approach to the \nlanding site, so he had elected\
  \ to follow his escape path down the mountain slope.  However, \nhe had been unable\
  \ to prevent the helicopter descending rapidly and it struck the slope \nheavily.\
  \  \n4.1.5.  The following analysis considers whether any of the following  factors\
  \ affected  the intended \nflight path or contributed to the escape manoeuvre being\
  \ unsuccessful : \n\u25CF the helicopter encountered 'sinking air ' \n\u25CF engine\
  \ performance  \n\u25CF the helicopter  performance  at the altitude of the landing\
  \ site  \n\u25CF a phenomeno n known as vortex ring state25  \n\u25CF pre-flight\
  \ planning  \n\u25CF any combination of these factors . \n4.1.6.  The analysis also\
  \ discusses two safety issues  and a potential  third  safety issue : \n\u25CF the\
  \ operator's standard operating procedures did not require its pilots to routinely\
  \ \ncalculat e the performance capabilit ies of their helicopters for the intended\
  \ flights  \n\u25CF there was  a risk of not knowing an aircraft's capability when\
  \ using standard passenger \nweights , and therefore of pilots operating close to\
  \ the limits of the ir aircraft's performance  \n\u25CF some New Zealand helicopter\
  \ pilots  may have a culture of  operating  their aircraft beyond \nthe manufacturers'\
  \ published and placarded limits , with the possibility that such a culture \nhas\
  \ become normalised . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  When planning an approach\
  \ and landing, a pilot needs to consider numerous factors to \nensure that the manoeuvre\
  \ is as safe as possible, especially when landing at a new or \nrestrictive landing\
  \ site.  For helicopter pilots many of these considerations are encapsulated \n\
  in what is termed 'the Seven S 's': size, shape, slope, surface, surrounds, sun\
  \ and select (the \nlanding spot) ( Civil Aviation Safety Authority [Australia],\
  \ 2012).  The specifics of each are \ndescribed in Appendix 2.  A pilot also needs\
  \ to consider the wind condi tions as part of the \nprocess.  \n4.2.2.  Having taken\
  \ all the factors into account, a pilot will determine the best approach path and\
  \ \nwhere the termination point - hover or landing - will be.  The approach direction\
  \ will \n                                                        \n \n25 See paragraphs\
  \ 4.3.36-4.3.47 for an explanation of and discussion on vortex ring state.  \n\n\

  \  This minimises the power required during the \napproach, helps a pilot to avoid\
  \ flying in the helicopter's own downwash and gives  them  time \nto manage the\
  \ approach and terminat e in a hover or landing .  The approach angle is also \n\
  crucial.  If it is too shallow or s teep there may be insufficient power available\
  \ to transition to \nthe hover.  When landing in a mountainous area, t he approach\
  \ angle should also be above \nthe 'demarcation' line where the wind changes from\
  \ an updraught to a downdraught and \nwhere turbulence can be present.  \n4.2.3.\
  \  A pilot should always have an escape route available in the event that something\
  \ goes  wrong , \nfor example having insufficient power to complete an approach\
  \ safely.  For a pinnacle or \nridgeline landing , the escape path may simply be\
  \ to turn a way from the high ground.  For a \nhelicopter such as the AS350, with\
  \ a main rotor that turns clockwise ,26 a turn to the left may \nbe preferable.27\
  \  A turn using left pedal requires less power than a right turn  using right pedal\
  \ , \nand therefore more power would be available to the main rotor to generate\
  \ rotor thrust or lift.  \n4.2.4.  The power required to perform a manoeuvre, for\
  \ example a hover, increases as density \naltitude28 or weight increases.  There\
  \ is a point where the power required exceeds the power \navailable.  This will\
  \ determine how an approach is flown and a landing made. For example, \nthere may\
  \ be insufficient power available to terminate in a high or 'out of ground effect\
  \ '29 \nhover.  The pilot may therefore have to terminate in a low or 'in ground\
  \ effect' hover , or land \nwithout hovering at all.  This is discussed in more\
  \ detail in section  4.3. \n4.2.5.  The pilot needed to know  the total weight of\
  \ the helicopter and to confirm t hat it had the \nperformance capability to land\
  \ at the site.  He also needed to assess the wind and \ntemperature as accurately\
  \  as possible .  The variable light wind and obscured marker flag \nmade it difficult\
  \ initially for the pilot to choose the best approach  direction.  \n4.2.6.  The\
  \ pilot said that a s the helicopter was approaching to land , he had detected a\
  \ slight sink  \nthat put the helicopter  below his intended approach path.  He\
  \  had raised the collective lever  \nslightly  to increase the rotor thrust in\
  \ an attempt to regain the desired approach profile.  The \npilot had then decided\
  \ that he could not achieve the landing site so he  had turned the \nhelicopter\
  \ to the left, his planned escape path , to fly away from the high groun d and down\
  \ the \nnorthern face of the mountain.  However, the pilot said the  rate of descent\
  \  had then  \nincreased rapidly and unexpectedly . \n4.2.7.  The helicopter struck\
  \ the steep slope heavily in a nose -down attitude.  The right skid \ncollapsed\
  \ under the force of the impact and the belly of the helicopter struck the slope.\
  \  The \nmarkings made in the snow indicated that this was likely followed by the\
  \ tail rotor guard \nhitting the ground and the helicopter pitching forward.  When\
  \ the main rotor struck the slope \nthis cause d the helicopter to roll down the\
  \ slope.  Five of t he occupants were thrown from  the \nhelicopter as it rolled\
  \ 300 m down the mountain.   \n                                                \
  \        \n \n26 Direction viewed from above.  \n27 Because the main rotor rotates\
  \ clockwise, the fuselage reacts by wanting to rotate anticlockwise.  Right \npedal\
  \ input is therefore required to counter this torque effect and keep the helicopter\
  \ straight, which requires \nadditi onal engine power.   \n28 The pressure altitude\
  \ corrected for any temperature difference from the temperature at that altitude\
  \ in the \nInternational Standard Atmosphere.  \n29 A helicopter is 'in ground effect'\
  \ when the downwash from the main rotor strikes the sur face, stopping the \ndownward\
  \ wash and generating an increase in pressure, effectively a cushion of air that\
  \ reduces the power \nrequired to maintain position.  The effect reduces as the\
  \ helicopter moves higher, meaning more power will \nbe required.  At a heigh t\
  \ equivalent to the distance of half to one rotor diameter, the effect is considered\
  \ to \nbe nil and the helicopter is said to be 'out of ground effect'.  \n \nFinal\
  \ Report AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 21 >>\n 4.3. Factors affecting the flight path\
  \  \nSinking air  \n4.3.1.  It is unlikely that the helicopter encountered sinking\
  \ air on the approach  to land .  There was \nlittle or no wind reported and therefore\
  \ neither turbulence nor downdraughts were considered \nto have been a contributing\
  \ factor.   However, variable wind conditions can be encountered in \nthe mountain\
  \ s.  Therefore,  the possibility of the  helicopter encountering downdraughts or\
  \ \nsinking air could not be totally excluded.  \n4.3.2.  In calm, sunny conditions,\
  \ differential heating causes updraughts.  A steep slope exposed to \nthe sun will\
  \ heat up more than one that is not similarly exposed.  The heated a ir adjacent\
  \ to \nthe slope rises and generates an upslope wind called an anabatic wind.  Local\
  \ paragliding \npilots interviewed for the investigation advised that even in winter\
  \ they had experienced \nanabatic wind off snow -covered slope s.  The wind would\
  \ normal ly be light in strength and \nwould quickly dissipate as the afternoon\
  \ progressed.  \n4.3.3.  At the time of the accident the northern slopes of Mount\
  \ Alta would have been facing directly \ntowards the sun.  The approach was being\
  \ made from the side of the northern slope of Mount \nAlta, making it more likely\
  \ that the air mass would be rising up the sl ope over which the pilot \nhad chosen\
  \ his escape path.  On the approach to land the helicopter was unlikely to have\
  \  \nencountered sinking air.  \nEngine performance  \n4.3.4.  The possibility of\
  \ a sudden power loss was examined in detail and discounted as a cause of \nthe\
  \ acc ident for a number of reasons. First, the pilot said there had been no power\
  \ loss or \nengine problem and neither the pilot nor the guide, who was also on\
  \ headset and familiar \nwith helicopters, reported seeing or hearing any low engine\
  \ or rotor RPM (revoluti ons per \nminute) warning indications.30  This was supported\
  \ by other witnesses who indicated that the \nhelicopter had been performing normally\
  \ as it approached the intended landing area.  \n4.3.5.  Secondly, rotor strike\
  \ marks on the slope and the damage to the main rot or blades and \nStarflex main\
  \ rotor head were consistent with the blades rotating at high speed when they \n\
  struck the slope.  They were also consistent with the main rotor being driven by\
  \ the engine \nwhen it struck the slope.  Thirdly, the witness marks on the  engine's\
  \ fifth -stage module \nconfirmed that the engine had been delivering power and\
  \ , given the degree of misalignment, \nprobably high power, at the time the helicopter\
  \ struck the slope.  Fourthly, the scoring marks \non the inside of the coupling\
  \ tube showed that the engine had still been driving the main rotor \ntransmission\
  \ as the helicopter  tumbl ed down the hillside.  Finally, there was no pre -existing\
  \ \nfault found and the damage sustained by the engine was consistent with the impact\
  \ \nsequence.   \n  \n                                                        \n\
  \ \n30 A constant aural warning horn and associated warning light will activate\
  \ when main rotor RPM reduces \nbelow the normal operating range.  A sudden engine\
  \ failure will also result in a sudden yawing of the \nhelicopter and a range of\
  \ other instrument warning indications.  \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report AO -2014\
  \ -005 Weight and balance  \nSafety issue - the operator's standard operating procedures\
  \ did not require i ts pilots to \nroutinely calculat e the performance capabilit\
  \ ies of their helicopters for the intended flights . \nSafety  issue - there was\
  \ a  risk of not knowing an aircraft's capability when using standard \npassenger\
  \ weights , and therefore of pilots  operating close to the limits of the ir aircraft's\
  \ \nperformance . \n4.3.6.  The Commission determined that at the time of the accident\
  \ the helicopter was over its \nmaximum permi tted weight  by approximately 3 0\
  \ kg, and the longitudinal centre of gravity for \nthe helicopter was about  3.0\
  \ centimetres (cm) forward of the limit.  \n4.3.7.  To ensure that an aircraft is\
  \ flown within its design limits, Civil Aviation Rule 135.303 requires \nan operator\
  \ to establish the weight of the c rew, passengers and baggage or goods for each\
  \ \nflight (CAA, 2007).  A weight and balance check is to be completed to determine\
  \ an aircraft 's \nweight and centre of gravity for the flight, and to provide a\
  \ basis for performance calculations.  \nThe weight of the  passengers can be determined\
  \ using one of three options:  \n1. The operator conducts a survey to establish\
  \ a standard passenger weight.  \n2. The operator uses a passenger's declared weight\
  \ with 4 kg added  to allow for the \ntendency of people to underestimate their\
  \ we ight. \n3. The operator weighs each passenger.  \n4.3.8.  The CAA issued an\
  \ Advisory Circular (CAA, 2005) detailing the procedure an operator had to \nundertake\
  \ in order to establish a standard passenger weight.  The operator had undertaken\
  \ a \npassenger weight survey in 2010 , which resulted in an average passenger weight\
  \ of 76.57 \nkg.  This was rounded up to 80 kg to provide a more conservative and\
  \ easier -to-use figure.  \nThe standard passenger weight of 80 kg was used for\
  \ calculating helicopter weight and \nbalance for most (tou rist) trips.  \n4.3.9.\
  \  The Advisory Circular made the point that \"there is no relief provided in the\
  \ C ivil Aviation  \nRules  for an aircraft to operate overweight when using standard\
  \ passenger weights \".  Civil \nAviation  Rules also require air operators to adhere\
  \ to the limitations set by the aircraft \nmanufacturers.  \n4.3.10.  For weight\
  \ and balance calculations, the operator's pilots could  use the weight and balance\
  \ \ncalculator ,31 which included the details  for each helicopter , or use the\
  \ operator's standard \nloading plan.  However, the helicopter was new to the fleet\
  \ and this was the first day the \noperator had used it for  commercial operations\
  \ .  The operator had not yet entered the  \nhelicopter's  weight and balance details\
  \ into the calculator database.   This would have been  \nunlikely to make  any\
  \ difference on the day of this accident because t he operator's pilots \nnormally\
  \ used the standard loading configuration based on standard passenger weights \n\
  instead.  Nevertheless, the weight and balance details should have been loaded into\
  \ the \ncalcu lator to allow the pilot the option of using it , particularly as\
  \ the helicopter was new to the \nfleet . \n4.3.11.  The operator's procedures contained\
  \ within its exposition32 stated that: \"A Weight & Balance \nCalculation is NOT\
  \ required for any flight that is loaded in c ompliance with a standard loading\
  \ \nplan authorised by Ops Procedures 9. 1\".  The standard loading plan form  described\
  \ a range  \nof passenger combinations  and guidance information.  For example,\
  \ w hen there were two \npeople in the dual front seat  the form stated , \"the\
  \ smallest person of all the passengers \n                                     \
  \                   \n \n31 A computer program usable for all of the operator's\
  \ helicopters.  A pilot or designated person would enter \nthe weight of each seat\
  \ occupant, the fuel load and any cargo to determine the helicopter's all -up weight\
  \ and \ncentre -of-gravity position.  Alerts would be generated if the program calculated\
  \ that the helicopter was \noutside any flight man ual weight and balance limit.\
  \  \n32 The Helicopter Line Operations Manual 9.1, dated June 2014.  \n \nFinal\
  \ Report AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 23 >>\n present should be located in the inboard\
  \ position \".  This would help to ensure that : any weight \nlimit for the dual\
  \ front seat was not exceeded ; the helicopter's centre of gravity was within \n\
  allowable limits ; and the passenger's right arm was less likely to interfere with\
  \ the pilot's use \nof the collective lever located between the two seats.33  The\
  \ surveyed exposition weight of 80 \nkg was to be used for each adult, with lesser\
  \ weights used  for children and infants.   \n4.3.12.  The standard loading plan\
  \ applied to the majority of the operator's scenic operations.  For \nspecialised\
  \ activities, such as heli -rafting, heli-biking and heli-skiing, pilots were directed\
  \ to \nthe weight and balance calculator's 'Frequent Unique Activities ' page.34\
  \  The page contained \nstandard loading configurations , which used a range of\
  \ assumptions for each of these \nactivities.  However, in June 2014, before the\
  \ commencement of the heli -ski season, the \noperator  had issued an Operations\
  \ Notice that took precedence.  This notice described the \nstandard empty weight\
  \ configuration for heli -ski flights  and includ ed standard pilot and \npassenger\
  \ weights  (95 and 80 kg respectively) , 20% fuel load, 4 kg in the boot locker,\
  \ no  \nsurvival bags ,35 10 kg for empty lunch containers in the boot and the heaviest\
  \ ski basket \ncontaining  42 kg of ski equipment, an 8 kg guide pack and 2 kg for\
  \ other client gear.  \n4.3.13.  The Commission calculated the helicopter's take\
  \ -off weight and balance for the accident trip \nusing each of the three options\
  \ referred to in paragraph 4.3. 7.  A fuel load of 50% (270 litres \nweighing 216\
  \ kg) was used for each of the calculations.  This was based on the pilot having\
  \ \nrefuelled the helicopter to nearly 60% before loading group C and flying them\
  \ to the top of \nTony's Run, then descending and loading group A.  \n4.3.14.  Using\
  \ standard passenger weights.   In the operator's Operations Notice 261 for heli\
  \ -skiing the \nfollowing figures are used:  480 kg for the six passenger s, 95\
  \ kg for the pilot  and 4 kg for the \npilot's bag .  For the  lunch  containers,\
  \ 20 kg was used as the clients had yet to eat lunch .  The \nheaviest  ski basket\
  \ at 43 kg contain ed a total of 52  kg of ski equipment and bags .  This gave \n\
  a total weight of 2,2 37 kg on the  accident flight, 13 kg less than the maximum\
  \ allowed 2,250 \nkg.  The centre of gravity was calculated to be at the forward\
  \ limit of 3.210 m . \n4.3.15.  The pilot's u se of declared passenger weights.\
  \   For the accident flight the pilot assumed that \nthe five passengers weighed\
  \ an average of 85 kg , which  was based on his observation of the \ngroup and a\
  \ discussion with one of the passengers.  The pilot did not add the 4 kg allowance\
  \ \nthat was  required, beca use he thought 85 kg was a good approximation.36  The\
  \ pilot recalled  \nthat the weight of the guide had been  78 kg and allowed 95\
  \ kg for the ski basket and \nequipment  and 20 kg for the lunches in the baggage\
  \ compartment.  The pilot had known  his \nown weight to be 80 kg with another 5\
  \ kg for his bag.  The take-off weight for these conditions \nhad been  calculated\
  \ as  2,246 kg, 4 kg under the maximum permissible weight , and the \ncentre of\
  \ gravity at the forward limit.   Had the pilot added the mandatory 4 kg to each\
  \ \ndeclared passenger weight , he would also have had to reduce the fuel load for\
  \ each flight in \norder to prevent the helicopter 's weight exceed ing the maximum\
  \ permissible .  \n4.3.16.  Estimated weight.   The weights of the pilot, guide\
  \ and passengers were obtained throug h \ninterviews and medical records.  The ski\
  \ basket  and contents  were  weighed  soon after the \naccident .  The pilot's\
  \ weight was stated to be 80 kg .  The  combined  weight of the guide, \npassenger\
  \ s and their  gear was estimated to be 603 kg. The pilot's bag weighed  5 kg, there\
  \ \nwas 2 kg of gear in the left locker,  and the ski basket weighed  36.5 kg. \
  \ The lunches were \n                                                        \n\
  \ \n33 A collective guard also helped to reduce the possibility of interference.\
  \  \n34 The operator's 'standard operating procedures' for heli -skiing also directed\
  \ pilots to follow these loading \nprocedures.   \n35 Survival bags were not carried\
  \ because all occupants wore warm clothing and there were other helicopters \nin\
  \ the vicinity that would be able to render immediate assistance.   \n36 CAA Advisory\
  \ Circular AC 119 -4 direct ed operators to determine a more indicative weight when\
  \ a \npassenger's weight was \"clearly greater than the exposition or standard weight\
  \ \".  \"The term 'clearly greater ' \nrefers to a passenger whose weight can be\
  \ readily assessed as being over the applicable expo sition or \nstandard weight.\
  \ \"  To help describe this , the Advisory Circular used the example of a person\
  \ being 34 kg over \nthe standard weight, while for a person who weighed \"less\
  \ than 110 kg, the term 'clearly greater than ' is not \napplicable and a more indicative\
  \ weight is not necessary \".   \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Final Report AO -2014 -005 estimated\
  \ to weigh 20 kg.  With an estimated fuel load of 216 kg, the total weight of the\
  \ \nhelicopter at the start of the accident flight was estimated to have been 2,289.5\
  \ kg (about 39 \nkg more than the maximum permi tted).  At th is weight, and using\
  \ the known seating positions, \nthe centre of gravity was determined to be up to\
  \ 0.030 m (3.0 cm) ahead  of the forward limit  \n(see Appendix 3).  The lateral\
  \  centre of gravity was determined to be within  the maximum \npermissible limits\
  \ for each of the three calculations , at about 7 .1 cm left of centre.  The \n\
  maximum distance allowed was 18 cm. \n4.3.17.  During  the accident some passengers\
  \ ' ski apparel was  contaminated wit h fuel  and \nsubsequently  discarded  by\
  \ the passengers.  Therefore the Commission weighed a  range of \ncommonly used\
  \ skiing an d snowboarding apparel  and used these weights in its calculations .\
  \  \nAn allowance  was added for personal items such as cameras, cell phones , snacks\
  \ and water .  \n4.3.18.  Allowing  for about  9 kg of fuel used in the  climb up\
  \ Mount Alta, the weight of the helicopter as \nit approached the landing site was\
  \ estimated to have been 2,280 kg, which would have been  \n30 kg over the maximum\
  \ permitted weight . \n4.3.19.  Civil Aviation Rules allow t he use of standard\
  \ passenger weights , in recognition  that it is not \nalways  practical for all\
  \ helicopter operations  to physically weigh every passenger carried .  \nHowever,\
  \ the rules are explicit that no aircraft  should be flown outside permissible weight\
  \ and \nbalance limits, regardless of the method used  to calculate weight and balance\
  \ . \n4.3.20.  Heli-skiing is considered one of the riskiest type s of helicopter\
  \ passenger operation.  It is \nconducted at high altitude in mount ainous terrain,\
  \ with the  additional challenges that pilots \nface when landing in snow.  Also,\
  \ the helicopters are often being operat ed with loads  that \nplace them  at the\
  \ margins of their performance capabilities . \n4.3.21.  It is not difficult to\
  \ weigh every passen ger who is undertaking heli -skiing.  Every passenger \npasses\
  \ through some point  where this could occur .  It is also not difficult to provide\
  \ pilots with \ndevices that enabl e them to calculate  accurately  the weight and\
  \ balance of their helicopter s \nat any time  in the field should that be required\
  \ . \n4.3.22.  There was considerable risk in an operator using a standard loading\
  \ configuration  that \nassumed standard passenger weights for heli -skiing operations\
  \ , particularly when two \npassengers were to occupy the dual front seat in the\
  \ Squirrel helicopter .  In this case the use \nof a standard loading configuration\
  \ and weights was not appropriate  because  the passengers \ncould be loaded in\
  \ such a way that the helicopter  was outside its weight and balance lim its. \n\
  This had been the situation for some time and was not recorded in  CAA audits or\
  \ the \noperator's own quality assurance processes .  The same would have applied\
  \ to any Squirrel \nhelicopter similarly configured and loaded using standard weights.\
  \  \n4.3.23.  The pilot  attempt ed to  manag e the loading of his helicopter after\
  \ he left the base.  However, \nhe had no means of weigh ing the passengers.  H\
  \ aving changed his weight calculation from \nusing a standard loading plan to using\
  \  assessed weights, he was required to include  the \nadditional 4 kg for each\
  \ passenger .  Had he done so, he could have reduced his fuel load to \nkeep the\
  \ helicopter below the maximum all -up weight.  However, it was never going to be\
  \ \npossible for him to  calculate the helicopter's longitudinal centre of g ravity\
  \  accurately without \nthe aid of a weight and balance calculator.   The risk of\
  \ inadvertently exceeding the limits was  \ntherefore  high.  \n  \n \nFinal Report\
  \ AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 25 >>\n Helicopter performance  \n4.3.24.  The need for\
  \ pilots to understand the performance capabilit ies of their aircraft is well known.\
  \  \nThe CAA comments  in its Helicopter Performance  publication : \nTake -off,\
  \ landing and hovering are all potentially risky phases of helicopter flight.  \n\
  The more that we can do as pilots to minimise these risks - especially when  \n\
  operating at high gross weights, from challenging sites, with high density altitudes\
  \ - \nthe safer we will be . \nMost performance -related accidents can be prevented,\
  \ provided that the pilot \nmaintains a good awareness of the surrounding conditions,\
  \ knows the p erformance \nlimitations of the helicopter, always does a power check\
  \ before committing to a \nmarginal situation, and is disciplined enough to \"give\
  \ it away early\" if the odds are \nstacking up against getting the job done safely\
  \  (CAA, 2012, p. 33) . \n4.3.25.  To determine accurately an aircraft's performance\
  \ capability, it is necessary to know the total \naircraft weight, the pressure\
  \ altitude37 and the air temperature  before the intended take -off \nand landing\
  \ .  The pilot recognised that the helicopter would be heavy, but he did not estimate\
  \ \nthe total weight accurately.  Therefore  he would not have known accurately\
  \ the combined \neffect of the total weight, the air temperature and the pressure\
  \  altitude.  The pilot  noted that \nat some point the outside air temperature\
  \ gauge in the helicopter was reading about 0\xBAC.38  \n4.3.26.  A landing onto\
  \ a site like that on Mount Alta is usually made after a steady descent , the \n\
  steepness of which  depend s on the excess power available and the wind strength.\
  \  The \nexcess power, or power margin, decreases with increasing altitude or weight.\
  \  It is good \npractice to check the power required before landing by  flying at\
  \ minimum power speed when \nin the vicinity of the landing si te.  However, t he\
  \ pilot did not check the power until he was on \nthe final approach  to the landing\
  \ site .  He c onsidered  that the power being demanded at that \npoint was not\
  \ \"excessively high\" for the conditions . \n4.3.27.  A pinnacle landing site such\
  \ as  Mount Alta would  not offer the benefit of a true ground \neffect ,39 because\
  \ the ground would slope away too steeply in all directions.  Therefore \noperations\
  \ at such a site should be planned on the basis of landing from an out -of-ground\
  \ -\neffect hover, which requires more power.  \n4.3.28.  The helicopter flight\
  \ manual performance charts showed that at the maximum permissible \nweight of 2,250\
  \ kg and an air temperature of 0\xBAC the helicopter had an out-of-ground -effect\
  \ \nhover capability of up to 7,750 feet and an in-ground -effect hover ca pability\
  \ of up to 9,500 \nfeet.  The charts also showed that the maximum altitude for an\
  \ out -of-ground effect hover at \nthe estimated  weight of 2,280 kg was about 7,300\
  \ feet.  T he altitude of the landing site was \n7,545 feet . \n4.3.29.  The performance\
  \ charts were conservative, in that they  assum ed an engine that met  the \nminimum\
  \ guaranteed p erformance .  The operator reported that the engine had been  \n\
  performing satisfactorily before the accident flight.   Airbus Helicopters advised\
  \ that the \noperator's most recent engi ne performance data had indicated that\
  \ the engine was \"able to \nsupply more than the minimum guaranteed engine power\
  \ \".  However, the best way for a pilot \nto assess the likely capability was to\
  \ check the power margin before landing .   \n4.3.30.  The topography of the landing\
  \ site was such that there would have been some ground effect \navailable only if\
  \ the  helicopter had reach ed the chosen landing site.  Helicopter performance\
  \ \n                                                        \n \n37 The altitude\
  \ in the International Standard Atmosphere with the same pressure as the part of\
  \ the \natmosphere in question.      \n38 0\xBAC was used in the following performance\
  \ calculations.  \n39 When hovering close to the ground, the ground acts as a cushion\
  \ and reduces the p ower required to \nmaintain position.  Moving higher reduces\
  \ the effect of the cushioning , and the power required increases \nuntil about\
  \ the equivalent of half of the rotor diamet er, when the effect is considered to\
  \ be nil.   \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Final Report AO -2014 -005 charts indicated that\
  \ there was a sufficient power margin available for an in-ground -effect \nhover\
  \ at weights up to about 2,450 kg.  \n4.3.31.  BEA (and Airbus Helicopters) advised\
  \ that at the calculated centre of gravity, \"the pilot would \nnot have been able\
  \ to observe  that he was outside the flight envelope defined by the flight \nmanual\
  \ \".  In other words, the position of the centre of gravity was not so extreme\
  \ that a pilot \nwould have noticed, and they would have had no difficulty controlling\
  \ the helicopter.  A \nforward centre of gravity would assist a pilot to move forward\
  \ or accelerate t he helicopter, \nprovided there was sufficient terrain clearance\
  \ to do so.  \n4.3.32.  Before departing on the flight to the top of Mount Alta,\
  \ the helicopter was over its maximum \nallowable weight by 39 kg.  It was also\
  \ forward of it s centre of gravity limit by about  3.0 cm.  \nThe pilot said that\
  \ the performance of the helicopter on lifting from the staging area, landing \n\
  at the top of Tony's Run and uplifting group A from the bottom of Tony's Run , had\
  \ been as \nexpected and he had had no problem controlling the helicopter.40  The\
  \ landing site at the top \nof Tony's Run was about 140 m lower than the Mount Alta\
  \ landing site.   \n4.3.33.  The first sign that the helicopter was not performing\
  \ as the pilot expected was the unexpected \nslight sink  when approaching the landing\
  \ site.  The pilot said that as he got close to the \nlanding site he had been \
  \ focused outside the helicopter , managing the approach p ath, and \nhad not paid\
  \ close attention to the airspeed or power demand .  He had noticed that he was\
  \ \ndemanding about 90% of the normal operating range  before the sink occurred\
  \ , after which he \nhad immediately initiated his escape manoeuvre.  The guide\
  \  recalled  that the helicopter had \n\"almost stopped \" before it turned away\
  \ to the left.  It was very likely that the helicopter's \nspeed had red uced below\
  \ that for translational41 lift and the power requirement was \nincreasing with\
  \ further speed reduction.  \n4.3.34.  It is very unlikely that the helicopter entered\
  \ into ground effect , because when the pilot turned \nthe helicopter left it  had\
  \ not reached the landing site and was moving over  ground that sloped \nsteep ly\
  \ away .  Therefore it was very likely that the helicopter had been  approaching\
  \ an out -of-\nground -effect hover, and it may not have had sufficient performance\
  \ to achieve that, even if \nthe pilot ha d demanded all available power.  \n4.3.35.\
  \  The last recollection the pilot had of the power he was demanding was about \
  \ 90% of normal \ntorque , which  he observed before he abandoned the approach.\
  \  It was unclear from the \nevidence whether the pilot increased the  power  demand\
  \ after that , but the performance \ngraphs indicate d that there may not have been\
  \ sufficient power anyway.  The distance f rom \nthe intended landing site to the\
  \ first point of impact was 20 m vertically and 47  m \nhorizontally.  If the helicopter\
  \ was already operating beyond its performance capabilities and \ndescending, any\
  \ banked turn would have increased the rate of descent.  The greater the \nangle\
  \ of bank , the greater the effect.  It is unclear whether the helicopter gained\
  \ sufficient \nforward speed  to achieve translation al lift before striking  the\
  \ slope.    \nVortex ring state  \n4.3.36.  The previous section s have described\
  \ how the approach was flown when the  helicopter was \noperating above  the limit\
  \ of its performance  capability , which  resulted in a sink rate \ndeveloping before\
  \ it reached the landing site.  The initial sink rate was very unlikely to have\
  \ \nbeen high, but occurred close enough and low enough to the terrain for the pilot\
  \ to make  a \ndeliberate turn in the direction of his plan ned escape path .  \
  \ \n                                                        \n \n40 Controllability\
  \ and the e stimated performance are checked against the amount of power being used\
  \ \n(weight) and cyclic control (centre of gravity).  \n41 Translation is the phase\
  \ of flight when accelerating from a  hover to forward flight or back to a hover\
  \  \n \nFinal Report AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 27 >>\n 4.3.37.  The pilot reported\
  \ that an unexpected increase in the rate of descent had developed as he \ninitiated\
  \ his escape manoeuvre.  V ortex ring state42 is a phenomenon that can cause an\
  \ \nincreased and rapid rate of descent, so consideration was given to whether it\
  \ could have \nbeen a factor at some point in the accident sequence .  Vortex ring\
  \ state  occurs when a \nhelicopter is descending in its own downwash at a very\
  \ low airspeed and a moderately high \nrate of descent.  Any increase in power increases\
  \ t he downwash and results in the helicopter \ndescending faster.   Further information\
  \ on vortex ring state is given in Appendix 4. \n4.3.38.  The pilot could not recall\
  \ any of the symptoms  of incipient or established vortex ring state  as \nhaving\
  \ occurred at any time during the accident  sequence .  Possible reasons are that\
  \ the \nAS350 main rotor design has an anti -vibration feature that could have masked\
  \ the onset of \nbuffet.  If they were present, any  symptoms m ight have been assumed\
  \ to be associated with \nthe he licopter accelerating  through translation as the\
  \ helicopter dived away . \n4.3.39.  The pilot initially assessed the wind at Mount\
  \ Alta as almost calm or possibly from the south, \nso he approach ed towards the\
  \  south into the anticipated  wind.  However, during th at \nappro ach he could\
  \ not be sure of the wind direction, so he turned and made a n approach \nfrom the\
  \ south , heading north.  When he and the guide saw the wind indicator , he was\
  \ \nsatisfied that any wind was  light and from the south , which was consistent\
  \ with the aviation \nforecast for the area .  It was unlikely that  there was a\
  \  northerly wind blowing over the landing \narea .  \n4.3.40.  As mentioned above\
  \ , a moderate rate of de scent through the air is one of the factors that can \n\
  induce vortex ring state.  If a helicopter is des cending th rough updra ughting\
  \ air it will need a \nlesser rate of descent relative to the ground before it encounters\
  \ vortex ring state.  The sun \nwas shining on the northern -facing slope area over\
  \ which the helicopter was approaching to \nland.  Therefore  it was possible that\
  \ a light anabatic wind was blowing up the side of the \nmountain .   \n4.3.41.\
  \  Airbus Helicopters stated that the helicopter under the accident conditions \
  \ would not \ngenerally enter vortex ring state unless the rate of descent was in\
  \ the order of 900 fe et per \nminute.43  The pilot said he  had commenc ed the\
  \ escape manoeuvre immediately after the \naircraft had begun a slight sink and\
  \ not respond ed to the small increase in power  he had \napplied .  Therefore it\
  \ was very unlikely that the helicopter would have encountered vortex ring \nstate\
  \ on the approach.  \n4.3.42.  During the escape manoeuvre the pilot turned the\
  \ helicopter left through about 90\xBA.  The \nheading change would have altered\
  \ the relative direction of any wind that was present, but as \nthe strength of\
  \ the prevai ling wind and any anabatic flow were both likely to have been light,\
  \ \ntheir effect on the outcome of the manoeuvre was likely minimal.  \n4.3.43.\
  \  When t he pilot turned the helicopter and flew it down the slope, i t was likely\
  \ that the airspeed \nincreased as a result, which would generally  have  cause\
  \ d the helicopter to exit from the \n'envelope' in which vortex ring state could\
  \ be encountered.44 \n4.3.44.  When the helicopter was banked during the latter\
  \ part of  the escape manoeuvre, the vertical \ncomponent of the rotor thrust would\
  \ h ave decreased.  The vertical  component balances the \nweight  of the helicopter\
  \ , so any  reduction in that component will cause any rate of descent to \nincrease\
  \ .  Also, the pilot was actively trying to fly the helicopter down his intended\
  \ escape \npath .  \n                                                        \n\
  \ \n42 Sometimes called 'settling with power', the term 'vortex ring state ' is\
  \ used in this report to avoid any \nconfusion with 'over -pitching' and 'power\
  \ settling', where a helicopter may have insufficient power to \nmaintain a hover\
  \ and subsequently settles onto the surface.  \n43 A rate of descent of 300 feet\
  \ per minute is often quoted as the upper limit in order to avoid approaching \n\
  vortex ring state  (FAA, 2012).   The actual rate of descent depends on the specific\
  \ helic opter type . \n44 Airbus confirmed that at the weight estimated for the\
  \ flight, the vortex ring state envelope was bounded by \nan airspeed less than\
  \ 20 k nots and an existing rate of descent of more than 900 feet per minute.  \
  \  \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Final Report AO -2014 -005 4.3.45.  The pilot said he was\
  \ aware of the conditions required to enter vortex ring state , the \ncharacteristics\
  \ of vortex ring state , and how to exit it.  He had therefore  been  surprised\
  \ by the \nhelicopter's behaviour.  \n4.3.46.  The distance f rom the intended landing\
  \ site to the first point of impact was only 20 m \nvertically and 47 m horizontally.\
  \  The pilot estimated  that the helicopter had been  close to and \nabout 3 m higher\
  \ than the landing site when he initiated his escape manoeuvre.  The \nhelicopter\
  \ was already sinking  at that point.  It is feasible that his perception of a rapid\
  \ rate of \ndescent was e xplained by any increase in the rate brought about by\
  \ his manoeuvring the \nhelicopter , and because  he was closing with the ridgeline\
  \ to the right of his intended escape \npath, which w as where the helicopter first\
  \ struck .  \n4.3.47.  Based on the above analysis,  it is unlikely that vortex\
  \ ring state was a significant contributing \nfactor to the accident.  However,\
  \ the description of the helicopter's flight path  in the seconds \nbefore the collision\
  \  was deduced from the recollection of the people involved, and could not  \nbe\
  \ wholly substantiated by physical evidence .  It could therefore not be ruled out\
  \ that the \nhelicopter was affected to some degree by vortex ring state at some\
  \ stage as the pilot carr ied \nout his escape manoeuvre.  \nSummary  \n4.3.48.\
  \  The accident highlight ed the importance of pilots ' pre-flight planning to ensure\
  \  that \nhelicopter s will have sufficient performance to conduct intended flight\
  \ s safely.  It also \nhighlight ed the importance of pilots checking the performance\
  \ capabilit ies of helicopter s \nwhile in flight.  \n4.3.49.  The flight manual\
  \ performance charts  showed that at a weight of 2,28 0 kg the helicopter \ncould\
  \ not have achieve d an out -of-ground -effect hover at the altitude of  the landing\
  \ site and \nin an air temperature of 0 \xBAC.   \n4.3.50.  The evidence show ed\
  \ that it was very likely the helicopter began an uncommanded descent \nduring the\
  \ final phase of the landing , because it was approaching  an out -of-ground hover\
  \ with \nminimal  performance capability to hover  at that weight, altitude and\
  \ temperature.  The \ndescent continued as the pilot executed his escape manoeuvre,\
  \ likely exacerbated by the \nhelicopter banking as the pilot turned it away from\
  \ the landing site.  Although vortex r ing state \ncould not be ruled out as having\
  \ contributed to the helicopter's rate of descent in the \nmoments before impact,\
  \ this was considered unlikely . \n4.3.51.  Heli-ski operations are a high -risk\
  \ activity.  The risk is too high to be relying on  standard \nloading pla ns with\
  \ assumed standard passenger weights , when relatively small variations \nfrom the\
  \ standards can put a helicopter outside its published maximum performance \ncapability.\
  \  In addition,  pilots should not rely on ground effect to make successful landing\
  \ s in \nconfined or high -risk area s. \n4.3.52.  The operator has since amended\
  \ its procedures to require  a calculation of the actual weight \nand balance for\
  \ every flight.  Flexibility is provided for remote operations , where mobile \n\
  devices  and declared weights plus 6 kg can be used.  \nFindings  \n1. The helicopter\
  \ struck the face of the mountain heavily in a nose -down attitude \nwith a high\
  \ rate of descent.  \n2. The engine was almost certainly operating normally and\
  \ delivering a high level \nof power when t he accident occurred . \n3. The helicopter\
  \ was loaded by an estimated  30 kilograms  over the maximum \npermitted weight\
  \ of 2,250 kilograms , with its longitudinal centre of gravity an \nestimated up\
  \ to 3.0 centimetres  forward of the maximum permissible limit \nwhen the accident\
  \ occurred.   \n \nFinal Report AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 29 >>\n 4. The helicopter's\
  \ weight and the altitude at which it was being flown meant that \nit was operating\
  \ at or close to the performance limit for  an out -ground -effect \nhover .  It\
  \ is likely that the initial sink on the landing approach was a result of \nthe\
  \ helicopter moving into an out -of-ground -effect hover as the airspeed \nreduced\
  \ . \n5. It is unlikely that vortex ring state was a significant factor contributing\
  \ to the \naccident.  How ever, it could not be ruled out that the helicopter was\
  \ affected to \nsome degree by vortex ring state at some stage as the pilot carried\
  \ out his \nescape manoeuvre . \n6. The use of  standard loading plans for Squirrel\
  \ helicopter s fitted with dual front \nseats  was in appropriate , in that it was\
  \ possible for pilots and ground staff to \nfollow the plans and operate the helicopter\
  \ s outside their  permissible limits.  \n7. The use of standard loading configurations\
  \  that use standard passenger \nweights should not be permitted when aircraft are\
  \ fully loaded and operating \nclose to permissible limits . \n4.4. The operator\
  \ 's training policies and procedures  \n4.4.1.  The operator was one of the largest\
  \ helicopter operators in New Zealand , with extensive \nexperience of flying in\
  \ the mountains around Queenstown  and Wanaka and further afield.  \nThe operator's\
  \ pilots were experienced in this environment, with nearly all having more than\
  \ \n3,000 hours of flying helicopters.  The pilot of the helic opter  involved in\
  \ this accident had \nmore than 4,000 hours.  \n4.4.2.  The CAA, as part of its\
  \ audit programme, had routinely audited the operator with no major \nconcerns identified.\
  \  A more thorough five -yearly recertification audit had been undertaken in \n\
  July 2013, 13 months before the accident.  That audit report  had made n o serious\
  \ adverse \nfindings and had been  overall complimentary about  the operator and\
  \ management. In \naddition, while some adverse findings were made in audits of\
  \ some of the operator's bases  in \n2014 , the CAA did not consider it necessary\
  \ to alter the operator's audit programme, and the \noperator remained in the CAA's\
  \  lowest risk assessment band.    \n4.4.3.  The operator's induction, training\
  \ and competency programmes were tailored to alpine  \noperations .  For example,\
  \  new pilot s were not allowed to make their first landing s at remote \nmountain\
  \ site s.  These had to be undertaken by more qualified , senior pilot s, who would\
  \ \nassess the landing site s and ensure that wind marker s were available.  The\
  \ syllabus for this \nqualifi cation included subjects such as in -ground -effect\
  \ and out -of-ground -effect approaches, \nescape routes, performance considerations\
  \ and vortex ring state \"assessment and recovery \ntechnique \". Following the\
  \ M ount Alta accident, the operator reviewed its managem ent, \nsupervision and\
  \ training structure, resulting in a new management position and change of \nresponsibilities\
  \ and personnel.  \n4.4.4.  The operator considered heli -skiing to be a specialised\
  \ task to be undertaken by a restricted \nnumber of pilots only.  The operator \
  \ had written a standard operating procedure titled Heli -ski \n& Heli -hike Operations,\
  \ which detailed the requirements, planning and procedures to be \nfollowed.  \n\
  4.4.5.  Pilots nominated for heli -skiing were required to undergo specific training\
  \ and obtain approval \nbefore commencing any heli -skiing flights.  The training\
  \ and assessment syllabus for heli -\nskiing included a range of oral briefings\
  \ and air exercises.  Once a pilot was approved for heli -\nskiing operations ,\
  \ the operator continued to provide supervision through  more senior pilots \nand\
  \ through feedback from experienced guides.  Guides were not allocated to one pilot\
  \ and \ncould therefore compare their performance as the heli -skiing season progressed.\
  \  \n4.4.6.  The operator's general manager aviation commented that the risk of\
  \  vortex ring state was \ngreater when flying in the mountains because of the variable\
  \ conditions likely to be \nencountered , and because the terrain often necessitated\
  \ a steep or downwind approach.  The \noperator's training programme addressed this\
  \ risk by requ iring its pilots to undertake flight \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2014 -005 instruction on vortex ring state.  The manager commented that they\
  \ demonstrated vortex ring \nstate in mountainous terrain , which made the rapid\
  \ vertical acceleration and the height loss \nduring recovery very apparent.  \n\
  The pilot's training  \n4.4.7.  The pilot had been with the operator for nearly\
  \ four years before he was considered for heli -\nskiing.  He had been assessed\
  \ in 2011, but the operator had considered  that he required \nmore dedicated heli\
  \ -ski training  and experience , so he had been held over until the following \n\
  year. He had begun his dedicated heli -ski training  in June 2012.  Some areas for\
  \ \nimprovement had been identified, but these had later  been  signed off as being\
  \ addressed \nbefore the pilot was allowed to begin heli -skiing operations under\
  \ supervision .  He had then \ncompleted two seasons without incident and was considered\
  \ competent in this role.  Neither \nthe operator nor the guides spoken to had \
  \ any safety concerns about his performance as a \nheli-ski pilot.  \n4.4.8.  The\
  \ pilot said he considered his training to have equipped him well for the role of\
  \ a heli -ski \npilot.  Although the operator had been satisfied that the pilot\
  \ was ready to become a Category \nA pilot (unrestricted), it would have been good\
  \ practice for him to undergo a specific heli -ski \nassessment flight  for what\
  \ is acknowledged as a high -risk operation.   The results of such a  \nflight should\
  \ have been  included  in his training record.  \n4.4.9.  The Commissio n investigated\
  \ an accident involving another of the operator's helicopters near \nMount Tyndall\
  \ in October 2013 (10 months prior to this accident).  Although the \ncircumstances\
  \ of that accident were different, the Commission noted a lack of formal \nrecording\
  \ o f issues relating to that pilot's performance . \n4.4.10.  It is important for\
  \ operators to keep comprehensive , formal records of all pilot training.  \nHistorical\
  \ training records provide the basis for ongoing performance monitoring, particularly\
  \ \ngiven natural attritio n as safety and training managers move through the industry\
  \ . \n4.4.11.  The operator's training policies and procedures received a thorough\
  \ review in the course of \nthis inquiry and that into the Mount Tyndall accident\
  \ .45  Notwithstanding  the shortcomings in \ntraining record -keeping  found in\
  \ both inquiries , the training each pilot  had received was \nbroadly comparable\
  \ with that of other New Zealand operators.  The Commission heard from a \nCanadian\
  \ expert46 that the training was also broadly com parable with th at given by  Canadian\
  \ \nheli-ski operators .  Nevertheless , this operator experienced three  serious\
  \ landing accidents \nwithin three years.  \n4.4.12.  The CAA  had raised no recent\
  \ adverse findings against the operator's policies and procedures \nfor training\
  \ i ts pilots prior to these three accidents . \nFinding s \n8. The operator's policies\
  \ and procedures for training its pilots were broadly \ncomparable to those of other\
  \ New Zealand operat ors and to those of heli -ski \noperators in Canada . \n9.\
  \ The pilot was trained  in accordance with the operator's training standards  and\
  \ \nwas experienced in heli-ski operations.  \n \n                             \
  \                           \n \n45 See footnote 21.  \n46 The expert had a long\
  \ association with heli -skiing operations in Canada as a helicopter pilot, a regulator\
  \ \nand an independent accident investigator . \n \nFinal Report AO -2014 -005 \n\
  << Page 31 >>\n 4.5. A potential sector -wide safety issue  \n4.5.1.  New Zealand's\
  \ helicopter accident rate is higher than that of other aviation sectors.47  There\
  \ \nhas been public  criticism of how helicopters are operated in New Zealand, including\
  \ a culture \nof operating outside the manufacturers' published and placarded 'never\
  \ exceed' limitations .  \nShould this situation exist, there is a possibility that\
  \ such a culture has become n ormalised.  \nThe core safety issue would therefore\
  \ lie within the wider helicopter sector, with flow -on \neffects to individual\
  \ operators' safety systems.  \n4.5.2.  The Commission's inquiries have not fully\
  \ explored this potential wider issue.  However, the \nCommission is aware that\
  \ the CAA is undertaking a review of the helicopter sector risk profile, \nand has\
  \ recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation include the issue of operational\
  \ \nculture in that review.   \nFinding  \n10. There are indications that a culture\
  \ exists among some helicopter pilots  in New \nZealand  of operating their aircraft\
  \ beyond  the published and placarded limits.  \nSuch a culture adversely  affects\
  \  the safety performance of the helicopter \nsector.  \n \n  \n               \

  \ Survival  \nInjuries  \n4.6.1.  The injuries sustained by the deceas ed passenger\
  \ were consistent with his having been \nstruck by the broken right skid (see Figure\
  \ 6), and being ejected from  the helicopter and \ncaught between it and the snow\
  \ -covered slope as the helicopter came to rest.  His injuries \nwere unsurvivable.\
  \ Three of the surviving occupants sustained serious injuries, including \nfractures,\
  \ internal injuries and extensive bruising.  The remaining three occupants sustaine\
  \ d \nminor to moderate injuries, predominantly extensive bruising and sprains.\
  \  \nSafety briefing  \n4.6.2.  As discussed in section 3.1, the briefing of passengers\
  \ involved in heli -skiing was normally \nconducted in two separate briefings. \
  \ The first briefing was a general helicopter safety briefing \ngiven to passengers\
  \ before commencing flying.  The second briefing concerned activities \nwhile skiing,\
  \ for example avalanches and snow survival, and was normally given just prior to\
  \ \ncommencing heli -skiing.  \n4.6.3.  The content of the first  briefing, which\
  \ was detailed in the heli -skiing standard operating \nprocedure, included  (among\
  \ other things ) how to approach and depart the helicopter, no -go \nareas and emergency\
  \ equipment carried on board.  The operation of seatbelts was to be \ndiscussed,\
  \ w ith a requirement to ensure that the belts were fastened throughout the flight.\
  \  \nThere was, however, no mention of how tight the seatbelts were to be and this\
  \ aspect was not \nraised during the briefing of any of the groups on the day of\
  \ the accident.   \nSeat belts  \n4.6.4.  The seats and seatbelts fitted to the\
  \ helicopter were of the usual type fitted to AS350 \nhelicopters and conformed\
  \ with internationally agreed technical standards.48  However, the \nforce experienced\
  \ in the impact exceeded the design capability of the he licopter, its seats and\
  \ \nlikely also the seatbelts.49  Of the seven persons on board, two were retained\
  \ in their seats \nand five were ejected from the helicopter, either during the\
  \ initial impact or as the helicopter \nrolled down the mountain.  The following\
  \ s ection reviews the accident sequence in terms of \nsurvivability and explains\

  \ remained in their seats (positions B and F) were positioned about \nthe centreline\
  \ of the helicopter.  Therefore  as the helicopter rolled they would not have been\
  \ \nsubjected to the same centrifugal forces as those seated further outboar d.\
  \  Other factors that \nmight explain why they were not ejected from the helicopter\
  \  are discussed below .  \n4.6.6.  The three front seats (positions A, B and C)\
  \ were all equipped with four -point harnesses - a \nlap belt and two shoulder straps.\
  \  The outboard lap belt a ttachment fitting for seat C  broke .  \nDespite the\
  \ seatbelt remaining buckled, the broken attachment effectively released the \n\
  seatbelt and allowed the guide to be thrown out.  \n4.6.7.  The pilot recalled tightening\
  \ his seatbelt firmly before the flight and the latch r emained \nbuckled during\
  \ the accident sequence.  The forward section of the cabin floor was bent \nupwards\
  \ when the nose of the helicopter struck the slope, probably after being pitched\
  \ \nforward from the initial impact.  It was therefore almost impossible for h im\
  \ to have \n'submarined'50 down and forwards out of his lap belt.  It is more likely\
  \ that he was pulled \nupward between the two shoulder straps and the broken seat\
  \ back.  The occupant in seat B \nwas retained in his seat.  \n4.6.8.  The four\
  \ rear seats (positions D, E, F and G) were each fitted with a three -point harness\
  \ \ncomprising a lap belt and single shoulder harness.  The person in seat F, directly\
  \ behind seat \nB, was retained in his seat.  The person to his right, in seat E,\
  \ was thrown clear of the rolling \nhelicopter d espite his seatbelt remaining buckled.\
  \  Both lap belt connections for this \npassenger were found to be nearly fully\
  \ extended.  This would have given a very loose fit \naround the waist and, like\
  \ the pilot, he most likely slipped up through his lap belt.  \n4.6.9.  The s eatbelts\
  \ for seats D and G were found to be released and both persons had been \nejected\
  \ from the helicopter as it rolled down the mountain.  Although it was possible\
  \ that the \nbuckles were deliberately released, it was more likely that something\
  \ caught the b uckles \nwhile  the helicopter was  rolling down the slope and released\
  \ the seatbelts.  The lap belts for \nseats D and G were found at or near full extension,\
  \ which would have given a very loose fit \naround the waist.  \n4.6.10.  The seatbelt\
  \ catch mechanism was a common d esign found in most passenger aircraft \naround\
  \ the world.  To release the belt, the lever had to be pulled up nearly 70\xBA.\
  \  The lap belts \nbeing extended would have made it easier for the passengers to\
  \ locate and fasten them after \nboarding.  However, if a bel t remains loose around\
  \ the waist the chances of something \ninadvertently catching the semi -guarded\
  \ release lever increase.  Therefore, after buckling up \nthe straps the two lap\
  \ belts should be pulled as tight as possible to minimise movement in \nthe event\
  \ of an accident.  It also reduces the possibility of the buckle being inadvertently\
  \ \nreleased.  Only after landing, and when about to depart the aircraft, should\
  \ the buckle be \nreleased.  \n4.6.11.  On 20 November 2015 the operator issued\
  \ a notice to all staff reminding the m that seatbelts \nwere to be fitted \"snug\
  \ across the hips \". \nOther means of protection  \n4.6.12.  Five of the seven\
  \ occupants were wearing ski helmets during the flight.  However, this \nappears\
  \ to have had little influence on survivability in this case.  The two occupants\
  \ who were \nnot wearing helmets survived.  Among the five who were wearing helmets,\
  \ most had their chin \nstraps either loose or undone.  While ski -type helmets\
  \ are not designed for surviving a \nhelicopter crash, in the event of an accident\
  \ they could provide an additional level of safety, if \nworn properly.  \n4.6.13.\
  \  The sudden and violent nature of the accident meant that none of the occupants\
  \ had time to \nadopt a 'brace position' prior to the helicopter striking the slope.\
  \  The two occupants who \n                                                    \
  \    \n \n50 'Submarined' is a term used to describe a person being pulled downward\
  \ by the impact forces, and \npotentially through their still -secure seatbelt.\
  \    \n \nFinal Report AO -2014 -005 \n<< Page 35 >>\n remained in the helicopter\
  \ said that they had curled up as much as possible as it rolled down \nthe mountain.\
  \  The remaining occupants were either immediately thrown clear or did not think\
  \ \nto adopt the brace position.  The deceased passenger was wearing upper -torso\
  \ protecti on, \nsimilar to that worn by motocross riders.  It was considered very\
  \ unlikely that this would have \nprevented his adopting the brace position if he\
  \ had wished or was able to do so.  Wearing \nadditional body armour might have\
  \ reduced the severity of injury d uring the crash.  However, \nit would not have\
  \ provided any protection against the fatal injuries he received on this \noccasion.\
  \  \nEmergency response  \n4.6.14.  The helicopter was fitted with a 406 -megahertz\
  \ emergency locator transmitter.  This activated \nas a result of th e impact and\
  \ at 1251 the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand received \nan initial alert.\
  \  The injured guide was able to alert the pilot of another of the operator's \n\
  helicopters within minutes of the accident.  If this had not been done, the guides\
  \ of the  other \ngroups would have raised the alarm when the helicopter did not\
  \ return when expected.  A \nfurther back -up was provided by the operator's normal\
  \ flight -following through its base in \nQueenstown.  \n4.6.15.  There were no\
  \ issues with the speed at which the relevant authorities learned of the accident\
  \ \nand responded.  \nFinding  \n11. It is very likely that several of the passengers'\
  \ seatbelts were not securely \nadjusted.  If seatbelts are loosely fitting, occupants\
  \ are more likely to be \nejected from an aircraft and the seatbelt s are more prone\
  \ to inadvertent \nrelease during an accident.  \n \n  \n\n<< Page 36 >>"
