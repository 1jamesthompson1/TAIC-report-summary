Fatigue management does not appear to have been a contributing factor.
","0.0","8.333","The pilot's decision to continue the approach despite being unable to maintain the intended angle and then to follow an escape path suggests a possible human error in judgment under challenging conditions (4.1.4). Additionally, the assumption that the helicopter could land safely despite being over the maximum permitted weight may have contributed to the accident (5.3).
","2.887","11.667","The pilot was trained in accordance with the operator's training standards and was experienced in heli-ski operations (5.9). However, the report also notes the importance of keeping comprehensive, formal records of all pilot training for ongoing performance monitoring and professional development (8.3). The lack of a specific heli-ski assessment flight for the pilot, which is acknowledged as a high-risk operation, indicates a potential gap in ensuring the pilot's preparedness for the specific challenges of the flight (4.4.8).
","5.774","3.333","While the pilot was experienced and trained according to the operator's standards (5.9), the report suggests the importance of ensuring pilots are fully prepared for the specific challenges of each flight, including familiarity with the equipment and the environment (8.3).
","2.887","0.0","The report does not provide information suggesting that crew resource management was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","16.667","The helicopter was loaded by an estimated 30 kilograms above the maximum permitted weight, with its longitudinal center of gravity an estimated up to 3.0 centimeters forward of the maximum permissible limit when the accident occurred (5.3). This indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures regarding weight and balance limits, which are critical for helicopter performance, especially in mountainous terrain (5.4).
","5.774","13.333","The use of standard loading plans for Squirrel helicopters fitted with dual front seats was inappropriate, as it allowed for the operation of helicopters outside their permissible limits (5.6). This suggests an organizational safety culture that did not adequately prioritize adherence to weight and balance limitations, which are fundamental to safe helicopter operations (5.7).
","2.887","10.0","The report highlights the importance of flying in mountainous terrain, which places additional demands on a pilot's skills and an aircraft's performance, both of which could be at or near the limits of their capabilities. Operators need to ensure that their safety management systems address the additional risks associated with flying in such an environment (8.1).
","0.0","8.333","The CAA issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive concerning operating limitations for AS350 helicopters fitted with two-place front passenger seats, requiring operators to ensure that the helicopters were within their weight and balance limits (6.4). This action indicates that regulatory oversight and compliance were factors in addressing the safety issues identified in the accident.
","2.887","5.0","The pilot's inability to maintain the intended angle of approach and the decision to follow an escape path down the mountain slope suggest a potential loss of situational awareness during the critical phase of landing (4.1.4). Maintaining situational awareness is essential for avoiding accidents, especially during landing in mountainous terrain (8.1).
","0.0","0.0","There were no issues with the speed at which the relevant authorities learned of the accident and responded (4.6.15). Therefore, emergency response preparedness did not contribute to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The engine was almost certainly operating normally and delivering a high level of power when the accident occurred (5.2). There is no indication in the report that maintenance and inspection regimes were a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The report does not mention any issues related to the use of automation as a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","3.333","The weather conditions were suitable for the flight (4.1.2), and there is no indication that weather conditions played a significant role in the decision-making process that contributed to the accident.
","2.887","0.0","The report does not indicate that communication breakdown was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","20.0","The report indicates that there are indications of a culture among some helicopter pilots in New Zealand of operating their aircraft beyond the published and placarded limits (5.10). This culture, if present, could have contributed to the decision to operate the helicopter beyond its weight and balance limits, thus contributing to the accident.","25.981","true","N/A"
