  \ at State Highway 26/Piako Road was commissioned by \nWaka Kotahi  to improve the\
  \ safety features of the road/rail inter face. The intersection \nitself was challenging\
  \ to road users , as three separate  100 km/h roads joine d in the \nvicinity of\
  \ the rail crossing . This encouraged  road users to concentrate on being \nprepared\
  \ to follow give-way rules to avoid road accident s, rather  than focus on the \n\
  crossing , which was also a potential danger.  \n3.2 The roadwork activity at the\
  \ time of the accident  included the crossing. Receiving a go \nsignal from the\
  \ traffic controller  likely led the car driver to believe that they had \nclearance\
  \ through the entire area of activity , whereas the traffic controllers on duty\
  \ \nreported that they had the expectation that road users would stop if required\
  \ for any \nlevel crossing alarms.  \n3.3 The car driver held a learner's licence\
  \ but was described by family members as a \nconfident and competent driver . The\
  \ Transport Accident Investigation Commission \n(Commission) found no evidence \
  \ that the driver's level of experience  contributed  to \nthe safety fact ors identified\
  \ in this report.  \n3.4 The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding\
  \ the event to identify \nthose factors that increased the likelihood of the event\
  \ occurring or increased the \nseverity of its outcome. It also examines any safety\
  \ issu es that have the potential to \nadversely affect future operations.  \nSafety\
  \ issue : The TMP did not fully identify the risk s to road and rail vehicles approaching\
  \ the \ncrossing . \n3.5 The roadwork s being conducted were  part of an upgrade\
  \ to the crossing at that \nlocation and were  being controlled by traffic controllers\
  \ with stop/go signs.  \n3.6 Road traffic was diverted into a single lane to provide\
  \ a safe working area for road \nmarking contractors, and the traffic controllers\
  \ were present to ensure there were no \nconflicting movements of cars in the single\
  \ lane. There was a temporary speed limit of \n30 km/h in place within the area\
  \ of the roadwork activity.  \n3.7 The work had been approved by means of a TMP,\
  \ which had been signed off b y \nHiggins on behalf of Waka Kotahi in September\
  \  2019  (see Figure  4).  \n3.8 The TMP included information regarding the positioning\
  \ of  warning signs, road cones \nand traffic controllers  in relation to the proposed\
  \ work.  \n3.9 The TMP approved by the contractor under delegated authority from\
  \ Waka Kotahi did \nnot identify  the rail corridor and crossing within the work\
  \ area . This was contrary to the \nadvice in Waka Kotahi's own publication , Traffic\
  \  Control Devices Manual  Part 9 (NZ \nTransport Agency, 20 12), which stated in\
  \ part:  \nWhenever both rail and road corridors are within a work site, any traffic\
  \ management plan \nmust consider implications of the work and associated controls\
  \ on the safe operation of \neach corridor . \nIt is essential that critical featur\
  \ es such as railway lines and traffic control devices (such as \nflashing light\
  \ assemblies) are include d on plans. This will ensure those involved in the \n\
  \ \nFinal Report RO -2019 -108 |  \n<< Page 7 >>\n \n design and approval of the\
  \ plans fully consider the implications of the work on all traffic \n(including\
  \ road and rail vehicles) through the site as required by CoPTTM  [the Code of \n\
  Practice for Temporary Traffic Management ]4. \n \n \nFigure 4: Approved TMP  \n\

  \ \n3.10 Although required by the  TMP approving authority , the absence of any\
  \ reference to \nthe rail corridor meant that the planning of the proposed work\
  \ did not consider  the \ndanger to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing,\
  \ and subsequently no added \nprotection was required  to be put in place while\
  \ the work was being carried out . \n3.11 Vehicles were signalled through the roadwork\
  \ s area towards the crossing . Specific  \nprotection had not been put in place\
  \  to ensure  that road users would comply with \ncrossing alarm warning devices\
  \ as they normally would in the absence of any roadwork \nactivity.   \n3.12 A lack\
  \ of specific pro tection for the crossing within the work area increased the risk\
  \ to \nroad and rail vehicles .  \n3.13 The Commission has made a recommendation\
  \ to address this issue  in section 6 .  \nSafety issue : Work within the rail corridor\
  \  was undertaken without  a permit to do so being \nobtained.  As a result , potential\
  \ risk -mitigation actions that were required prior to the issue of \nthe permit\
  \ were not completed. Not  obtaining a permit increased  the risk to road and rail\
  \ users  \napproaching  the crossing .  \n3.14 PTEs were  granted by the National\
  \ Corridor Permit Manager , who was the KiwiRail \nofficial responsible for reviewing\
  \  requests by outside agencies needing to work within \nfive metres of the railway\
  \ corridor.  \n \n4 Waka Kotahi is responsible for setting the requirements for\
  \ the safe and efficient management and operation of \ntemporary traffic management\
  \ on all roads in New Zealand. CoPTTM is the best-practice guideline for \ntemporary\
  \ traffic management in New Zealand.   \nrailway line (not shown  on \nplan) in\

  \ was granted, a series of checks was to be  made to ensure there was no \nunacceptable\
  \ risk to KiwiRail assets  and users of the rail corridor.  \n3.16 On this occasion,\
  \ the contractor requested th at an existing  PTE granted for  a different \nlocation\
  \  be exte nded to cover the State Highway 26/Piako Road crossing.  \n3.17 The National\
  \ Corridor Permit Manager  questioned the request , as it did not follow the \n\
  correct protocol . After a period  of correspondence  on the matter , communication\
  \ \nceased . The request was not followed through  and a PTE was not issue d for\
  \ the \ncrossing.  \n3.18 The work requiring a PTE was the painting of yellow road\
  \ markings (hatching) that \ndenoted the danger area for road users close to the\
  \ crossing. This work went ahead \ndespite a PTE not having been issued  (see Figure\
  \ 5) . \n \nFigure 5: Painted hatching  at the crossing  \n(Credit: KiwiRail , modified\
  \ by Transport Accident Investigation Commission ) \n \n3.19 The RPO contracted\
  \ by the road markers contacted train control5 to request blocking6 \nfor the area\
  \ for the duration of the work. Due to the time of the evening  there was little\
  \ \nrail activity  and therefore, a lthough the work was not on a plan , it was\
  \ treated as a  \nroutine  ad hoc request for blocking and was granted by train\
  \ control.  \n3.20 Once the work had been  completed , the RPO contacted train control\
  \ to remove the \nblocking . At this point they were no longer required for protection\
  \ duties so  they \ndeparted the site hours before the accident occurred.  \n3.21\
  \ The work taking place within five metres of the railway corridor without a permit\
  \ had \nalready been completed at the time of, and therefore did not contribute\
  \ to , the \naccident . However , it is of concern to the Commission that an opportunity\
  \ was lost for \nKiwiRail to have oversight of the pla nned work , had the contractor\
  \ obtained a PTE . \n \n5 Train control is situated in Wellington Railway Station\
  \  and is responsible for track authorisations and the safe \nmovement of rail traffic.\

  \ that any risk -mitigation actions \nKiwiRail deemed necessary  (for example, \
  \ temporarily lowering the speed of trains \nthrough the crossing  or promulgating\
  \ the work site on the daily information bulletin ) \ncould not  be considered .\
  \ \n3.23 A further opportunity was los t in that by reviewing the planned work \
  \ KiwiRail may have \ndeduced from the TMP that there had been  an insufficient\
  \ consideration of the risk s \nposed by the crossing.  \n3.24 KiwiRail has provided\
  \ the Commission with documentation  on actions it has  taken \nsince the incident.\
  \ The documentation  include s alerts to industry  of the obligations  for \nappropriate\
  \ TMPs and the need for PTEs, and for updated checklist s to be completed \nbefore\
  \ PTE s are granted  (see Appendix 2). \n3.25 KiwiRail has also instituted a new\
  \ requirement for an  RPO to be in place where a TMP \nor work activity impacts\
  \ any of the warning devices on a crossing, or as otherwise \ndetermined necessary\
  \ in the c ircum stances.  The RPO will communicate directly with \nthe traffic\
  \ controllers.  \n3.26 The Commission welcomes th ese actions. However, rail access\
  \ provider s are only able \nto provide additional  protections if they are aware\
  \ in advance of the work taking place . \nThe current process , which place s the\
  \ onus on  contractors  to apply for PTEs after TMPs \nhave  been approved , increase\
  \ s the risk of work going ahead without rail access \nproviders ' knowledge or\
  \ approval.  \n3.27 The Commission has made a reco mmendation to address this issue\
  \ in section 6.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2019 -108 |  \n<< Page 10 >>"
