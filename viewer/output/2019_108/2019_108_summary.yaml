- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The accident was influenced by the driver's assumption that receiving a go signal from the traffic controller meant clearance through the entire area, including the rail crossing. "Receiving a go signal from the traffic controller likely led the car driver to believe that they had clearance through the entire area of activity" (3.2). This assumption contributed to the accident by affecting the driver's decision-making process.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing, which is a deviation from the safety procedures outlined in Waka Kotahi's Traffic Control Devices Manual Part 9. "The TMP approved by the contractor under delegated authority from Waka Kotahi did not identify the rail corridor and crossing within the work area" (3.9). This lack of adherence to safety procedures significantly contributed to the accident by failing to provide specific protection for the crossing within the work area (3.11, 3.12).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The TMP's failure to consider the rail corridor and crossing within the work area indicates a lack of risk management and analysis. "The absence of any reference to the rail corridor meant that the planning of the proposed work did not consider the danger to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.10). This lack of risk analysis increased the likelihood of the accident occurring.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The work within the rail corridor was undertaken without obtaining a permit, which is a failure in regulatory oversight and compliance. "Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.13). This failure to comply with regulatory requirements meant that potential risk-mitigation actions were not completed, increasing the risk to road and rail users (3.22, 3.23).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The organizational safety culture of the contractor and the oversight authority may have been lacking, as evidenced by the failure to include the rail corridor in the TMP and the failure to obtain a PTE. "The TMP approved by the contractor under delegated authority from Waka Kotahi did not identify the rail corridor and crossing within the work area" (3.9) and "the contractor requested that an existing PTE granted for a different location be extended to cover the State Highway 26/Piako Road crossing" without following the correct protocol (3.16, 3.17). This indicates a culture that may not prioritize safety considerations and compliance with procedures.
