- The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing.
- Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained. As a result, potential risk-mitigation actions that were required prior to the issue of the permit were not completed. Not obtaining a permit increased the risk to road and rail users approaching the crossing.
