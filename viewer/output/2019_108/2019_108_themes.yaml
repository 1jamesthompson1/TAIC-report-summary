- name: Inadequate Traffic Management Plan (TMP)
  explanation: 'The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing, which is a significant safety theme as it directly relates to the planning and management of the roadwork activity. The TMP approved by the contractor did not include the rail corridor and crossing within the work area, contrary to Waka Kotahi''s own guidelines that state "any traffic management plan must consider implications of the work and associated controls on the safe operation of each corridor" ("safety issue: the tmp did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.9 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This oversight in the TMP meant that no added protection was put in place for the crossing during the roadwork activity, increasing the risk to road and rail vehicles ("Safety issue: The TMP did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.10-3.12)).'
- name: Lack of Permit to Work within Rail Corridor
  explanation: 'Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without obtaining a permit, which is a critical safety theme as it bypasses the necessary risk-mitigation actions required prior to the commencement of such work. The absence of a Permit to Enter (PTE) meant that the contractor did not complete the series of checks to ensure no unacceptable risk to KiwiRail assets and users of the rail corridor ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.14-3.17)). This lack of oversight meant that KiwiRail could not consider necessary risk-mitigation actions, such as temporarily lowering the speed of trains through the crossing or promulgating the work site on the daily information bulletin ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.22-3.23)).'
- name: Miscommunication and Protocol Deviation
  explanation: 'The miscommunication between the contractor and the National Corridor Permit Manager, as well as the deviation from the correct protocol for extending a PTE, highlights a safety theme related to communication and adherence to established procedures. The contractor''s request to extend an existing PTE for a different location did not follow the correct protocol, and after a period of correspondence, communication ceased without a PTE being issued for the crossing ("Safety issue: Work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.16-3.17)). This breakdown in communication and protocol adherence contributed to the lack of proper oversight and risk mitigation for the work being conducted near the rail corridor.'
- name: Insufficient Consideration of Crossing Risks
  explanation: 'The TMP''s insufficient consideration of the risks posed by the crossing is a safety theme that reflects a lack of comprehensive risk assessment in the planning phase. KiwiRail may have deduced from the TMP that there had been an insufficient consideration of the risks posed by the crossing if they had been given the opportunity to review the planned work ("safety issue: work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.23 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant because it indicates a systemic issue where the potential dangers associated with the level crossing were not adequately addressed in the TMP, leading to increased risks during the roadwork activity.'
- name: Inadequate Protection for Road and Rail Vehicles
  explanation: 'The lack of specific protection for the crossing within the work area is a safety theme that underscores the failure to implement additional safety measures during roadwork activities. Vehicles were signaled through the roadworks area towards the crossing without specific protection being put in place to ensure that road users would comply with crossing alarm warning devices as they normally would ("safety issue: the tmp did not fully identify the risks to road and rail vehicles approaching the crossing" (3.11 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant as it highlights the absence of proactive safety measures to protect both road and rail vehicles at the crossing during the upgrade works.'
- name: Contractor's Responsibility and Oversight
  explanation: 'The current process placing the onus on contractors to apply for PTEs after TMPs have been approved is a safety theme related to the responsibility and oversight of contractors. This process increases the risk of work going ahead without rail access providers'' knowledge or approval, as evidenced by the fact that rail access providers can only provide additional protections if they are aware in advance of the work taking place ("safety issue: work within the rail corridor was undertaken without a permit to do so being obtained" (3.26 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This theme is relevant because it points to a gap in the system where contractors may proceed with work without the necessary permits and oversight, potentially compromising safety.'
