At the sea of about 470miles southeast from 
DUNEDIN port, New Zealand  
 
   A. The facts  
At 1000 hrs(UTC+12hrs, New Zealand local time) on 14th August in 2010, the O -Yang 
No.70 left the port of DUNEDIN, New Zealand for pollack trawl fishing with a crew of 51 
including the master BBB and a vacancy of a second officer. At 2140 hrs on 15th of the  
same month, the vessel arrived at the sea of 470 miles southeast from the DUNEDIN port, 
New Zealand and started its fishing job.  
As the fish catches were high at the sea arrived, the vessel stayed at the point for three 
days casting and hauling nets three  times. At 0300 hrs on 18th of the same month, it 
began forthly hauling nets when the chief officer CCC was handed over the watchkeeping 
duty from the master BBB.  
When winding up the rope of nets that were still in the water, the chief officer recognized 
that the fish catches in the net were remarkably heavy. Considering the difficulty of hauling 
job, the first officer requested the master who was sleeping to command the hauling 
operation by telephone at 0305 hrs on the same day and the master BBB came up t o the 
wheelhouse and commanded the hauling job,  
While the master BBB came up to the wheelhouse and command the hauling job, the nets 
were being raised to the upper deck. The boatswain DDD on the upper deck reported the 
master BBB that the amount of fish ca tches were too much and part of them had to be 
abandoned by opening the net in the sea water, therefore the master allowed to do so. 
Under the master's direction, the boatswain DDD abandoned about 20 tons out of 85 tons 
of fish catches at the sea around th e stern and continued hauling operation, but he did not 
tie the rope of the net which was equipped to prevent the nets from being listed to one 
side.  
At 0340 hrs on the same day, the nets hauled slanted to the left during the hauling 
operation and the hull  of the vessel listed 4~5 ° to port, which caused the flowing backward 
of sea water to the fish handling space as the check valve of the drains did not work. The 
fish handling manager JJJ who was working in the space found that the drains at the stern 
emitt ed foam letting the sea water flow backward to the space, so that he asked the first 
engineer EEE, who was on duty in the engine room, to adjust the heeling of the hull. 
Therefore, the first engineer EEE began moving the fuel oil from portside to starboard  
through the fuel transfer pump installed at the bottom of the engine room.  
At 0355 hrs of the same day, the hauling job was completed under the condition that the 
nets were gathered to the left and the hull heeled about 15 ° to portside when all nets were 
almost raised on the upper deck. When the nets were open to put the fish catches inside 
of the nets into the fishpond hatch, it was found that the fishes were attached each other 
due to the heavy weight of the total fish catches in the net, so they failed to be poured into 
the fishpond hatch smoothly. Moreover, as the hull heeled to port continually with the 
influence of the sea water flowing backward, the hauled nets on the upper deck also 
slanted to port more and more.  
As the hull heeled to port letting the hauled nets slanted to port, the master BBB tried to 
turn the hull through hard -a-port considering that the heeling of the hull could be recovered 
by using the external heeling while turing the hull. However, the internal heeling occurred 
at the early time of the hull turning and made it increased, which caused that a large 
amount of sea water flooded into the fish handling space through the drains and the hole 
for filth. After all the water went into the engine room through the door open at that time.  
As the sea water invaded into the engine room, the heeling of the hull was worsened and 
the master BBB directed all crew members to be ready for leaving the vessel at 0400 hrs 
on the same day. While the hull heeled continually and the sea water came into t hrough 
the fishpond hatch of the upper deck, at 0420 hrs on the same day the master BBB judged 
that it was not possible to recover the situation and directed all crew members to leave the 
ship, hence, all crew members excluding the master who was sending d istress signals left 
the vessel by life rafts, etc. At 0457 hrs on the same day, the vessel completely capsized 
and sank on position Lat. 48 °00'00"N, Long. 179 °44'00"E.  
At 0610 hrs on the same day, 45 crew members of the O -Yang No.70 who were drifting on 
7 life rafts were rescued by the New Zealand fishing vessel AMALTAL ATLANTIS, which 
listened the distress signals of the O -Yang No.70 and came for rescue. Three members 
drawn were found and another three including the master BBB were missing.  
At the time o f the accident, the weather was clear and the sea was also calm without wind 
and wave, but it was very cold.  
 
 
   B. Structure, equipment and the condition of the O-Yang No.70  
The Korea(Busan) -registered steel deep -sea trawl vessel O-Yang No.70  is 1,598.6 7 
G/T(L74.45 x B12.6 x D8.00m) with a 2,794 ㎾ diesel engine and was built and launched by 
Yamanishi Co., Ltd in Japan. She underwent the special survey by the Korean Register of 
Shipping and achieved a ship inspection certificate valid from 23 December 2009  until 22 
December 2014.  
The wheel -house of this vessel is located at the bow and there are trawl winch, derrick and 
a hole for throwing fish on the upper deck while the freezing room, temporary fish hold, fish 
handling space, etc are located under the upp er deck. The two fish holds no.1 and no.2 
are at the lowest space with the engine room.  
A sea water pump(10ton/hr) for washing fish is connected to sixteen washing valves(2.5 ㎝ 
of diameter) through sea water pipe(15 ㎝ of diameter) at the fish handling space.  Four 
drains(diameter 200 ㎜ x 2units, 150 ㎜ x 1 unit, 125 ㎜ x 1unit) with check valves for 
discharging treated wastewater are on the starboard and portside respectively. However, 
the drainage facilities are not inspected and maintained properly, so that the c heck valve 
of the drain does not function. Therefore, the vessel was in a dangerous situation that sea 
water could flow backward to the fish handling space under the heel angle of more than 
4.5°. 
There is a sewage outlet(800 x 500 ㎜) at about 300 ㎜ high from the bottom in the fish 
handling space for discharge smashed filth remained after handling fish out of the vessel. 
Although the outlet is usually closed with its watertight door, it was open at the time of the 
accident. In short, the vessel was i n a situation that sea water might have flooded into the 
fish handling space if had heeled more than 9.1 °.   
The passage from the engine room to the fish handling space was equipped with a 
watertight door on the portside and the door should be closed all t he time of sailing. 
Nevertheless, the door was being open at the time as the crew members had to often pass 
the passage as checking the condition of fishing equipments, freezing condition, etc.  
At 2140((UTC+12hrs, New Zealand local time, the same as above)  on 15th August 2010, 
the O -Yang No.70 arrived at the sea about 470miles southeast from DUNEDIN port of 
New Zealand and conducted fishing job three times as casting and hauling nets for three 
days.  
While the vessel was hauling nets fourthly at 0300 hrs on  18th of the same month, 3000 
boxes(approx. 78tons) of fish that had been caught were handled and stored at the fish 
holds and 200 pans(approx. 2.6tons) of fish was being handled at the fish handling space, 
She was also carrying about 520 tons of fuel oil( Bunker B oil) and 10 tons of other oil such 
as lubricant.  
   C. Consideration of the stability  
     1) Fish  
Among the fish caught, ① 3000 boxes(approx. 78tons) of dressed fish were stacked in 
fish holds and ② 200 pans(approx. 2.6tons) of fish that were caught at the third hauling 
operation were being dressed. Detailed information of the fish stacking condition is as 
shown in the Table 1 below.

     9) The required metacenter value of the O -Yang No.70 according to the stability 
regulation  
According to the stability provisions, the required metacenter of the vessel at the time of 
the accident was  
 GoM=0.04B+a ×B/D-ß 
 (GoM:  metacenter value,  B: width of the vessel(12.600), D: depth of the vessel(5.600)  
 a: 0.54 in case of steel vessel, ß depends on the F/D value)  
   0.04B= 0.04 ×12.600=0.504m  
   a×B/D=0.54×12.6/5.600=1.215  
Freeboard=Df(Freeboard Depth) -Mean draft  
Df(Freeboa rd Depth)  
= Moulded depth(Dm) of amidships +Bar Keel+Keel F.B+Deck Stringer+Keel    Plate  
= 5.600+0.174+0.012+0.007+0.014=5.807M  
F=Df(Freeboard Depth) -mean draft=5.807 -4.284=1.523  
Therefore, F/D=1.523/5.600=0.272  
ß is 1.081 according to the F/D value,  
Therefore, GoM=0.504+1.215 -1.081=0.638m  
     10) Conclusion  
As being considered above, it is estimated that the O -Yang No.70 conducted its fishing job 
with 0.560m of metacenter height at the time of the accident, which was not satisfied the 
standard metacenter height of 0.638m required by the stability provision.  
 
2. Causes  
The Article 2.1.A, B and D of the 「the Marine Accident investigation and Tribunal Act 」shall 
be applied to this submersion accident.  
   A. Consideration of causes  
     1) Stability of the O -Yang No.70  
At the time of the accident, the metacenter he ight of the O -Yang No.70 was 0.560m, which 
did not satisfied the standard metacenter value 0.638m of the vessel required by the 
stability regulation. While conducting the fishing job without securing enough stability, the 
vessel hauled the nets excessively  full of fishes by force, which caused heeling. In result, 
sea water flooded into the drains of the fish handling space and was not recovered.  
     2) Heeling caused by the hauling nets  
If the fish catches(about 76 tons) hauled list to port on the upper d eck, 
  GoM=[(w x d)/ △] x (1/tanθ), therefore,  
  w=moving weight(ton)  
  d=moving distance(Estimate a movement of 3m from amidships to port)  
  △=Displacement  
  0.560=[(65 x 3)/2228.4] x (1/tan Ø) 
  Ø≒8.9° 
According to the calculation, approximately 8.9 ° of heeling occurs, however, it needs to 
consider that the stability would be much worse if 65 tons of fish catches are hauled on the 
upper deck and the heeling becomes bigger than the value of the calculation.  
     3) Conditions for flowing backward to the dra ins of the fish handling space  
When the O -Yang No.70 heeled 8.9 ° to port, the drains of the fish handling space which 
was located about 0.5m height from the sea water surface becomes approx. 0.5m lower 
than the sea water surface. In this condition, the dra ins cannot prevent the sea water from 
flowing backward, so the water floods into the fish handling space, which causes the 
decrease of stability of the vessel and the hull heels to port.  
     4) Consideration of the improper sailing  
The master BBB put the helm hard a port to adjust the heeling hull as the hauling nets 
listed to port increasing the RPM of the main engine. However, it is estimated that those 
actions taken at that time facilitated the submersion by letting the hull list toward the 
turning side (internal heeling).  
According to the hull movement principles, the hull heels to the inward of the turning 
circle(internal heeling) and then to the outward of the turning(external heeling) when a 
steady turning becomes possible with a certain degree of tur ning angular speed, not 
heeling to the constant side during the turning.  
That is, the hull heels to the inward of the turning circle at the beginning of the turning and 
then heels to the outward of the circle due to the centrifugal force afterwards. These are 
referred to internal heeling and external heeling respectively.    
According to the basic knowledge of the hull movement principles, if the helm puts at large 
angle when the hull proceeds forward straight, there will be a force(MOMENT) to heel 
towards the side where the helm turned to(the listed side in this case). This is because the 
hull receives the water pressure(Fluid force) in proportion to the size of the turning angle of 
the helm while proceeding forward, so the advanced speed of the hull decrea ses due to 
the rudder force.  
The rudder force increases in proportion to the angle of the helm and the speed while the 
longitudinal factors of the rudder force decreases the speed of the vessel and the 
transverse factors causes heeling of the hull toward t he side where the helm turned to.  
Afterwards, the centrifugal force occurs as the turning speed of the hull increases, which 
makes the hull hell to the opposite side of the turning direction. As the heeling occurs 
outward, that is, the opposite of the tur ning direction(the center of the turning), it is referred 
to external heeling.    
   B. The causes of the accident  
This submersion accident occurred as the inspection and maintenance for the drain 
facilities of the fish handling space in the O -Yang No.70 w ere not conducted, so that the 
function for preventing sea water from flowing backward did not work while the hull heeled 
as the fishing nets listed to port during the hauling job under the insufficient stability, which 
caused the flooding of sea water int o the vessel through the drains of the fish handling 
space increasing the hull heeling, and, therefore, led to capsizing and submersion of the 
vessel.  
 
3. Lessons learned  
   A. In case of a trawl fishing vessel, the drains on the side of the fish handling space is 
equipped with the facility for preventing sea water from flowing backward, so discharging 
from inside to outside is possible but the reverse is prevented. However , the function does 
not work when the inspection and maintenance are negligent, which lets the sea water 
flow into the fish handling space and lose the stability, hence the vessel might capsize and 
sink. 
   B. When the nets are hauled on the upper deck wit h insufficient stability in a trawl 
fishing vessel, the nets can be listed to a side, which may cause a severe heeling.
