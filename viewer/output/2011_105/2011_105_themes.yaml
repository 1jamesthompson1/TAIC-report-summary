- name: Human Error and Error Detection
  explanation: Human error is a significant safety theme in this accident, as the train controller made critical mistakes that led to the wrong-routing of the freight train onto a closed track. The report states, "The train controller made errors that resulted in his wrong-routing the freight train from the open southbound track across to the closed northbound track" (4.1.1). Furthermore, the errors could have been detected and prevented if there had been a system in place for cross-checking with the person-in-charge that control blocking was in place (4.1.3). The lack of such a system allowed the train controller's errors to go unnoticed for over two hours (5.2).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  explanation: Crew resource management is another safety theme related to this accident, as it involves the use of all available resources within a group to improve safety. The report highlights that the train driver had an opportunity to avert the incident by voicing his concerns when he noticed the discrepancy in the routing but did not challenge the train controller's instructions (4.4.4). This indicates a need for better crew resource management practices, where all participants are aware of the plan and use all available resources to execute it safely (4.4.1).
- name: Communication and Challenge Culture
  explanation: Communication and the culture of challenging authority when safety is concerned are crucial safety themes. The train driver was reluctant to challenge the train controller's instruction, which he thought was incorrect (4.1.5). The report suggests that if the train driver had challenged the train controller, the potential collision might have been averted (4.4.4). This highlights the importance of fostering an environment where crew members feel empowered to speak up and question decisions for the sake of safety.
- name: Clarity of Safety Documentation
  explanation: The clarity and presentation of safety documentation is a safety theme that played a role in this accident. The special work bulletin, which contained critical information for the operation, was not presented in a clear and logical format, making it difficult for stakeholders like train drivers and controllers to understand the operational arrangements (4.5.4). The report finds that "The special bulletin outlining the plan for the major infrastructure and maintenance work did not present information to maintenance and operational staff in a clear and logical format" (5.4).
- name: Safety Protocols and Procedures
  explanation: Safety protocols and procedures are a theme as the accident revealed gaps in KiwiRail's safety rules. Specifically, the rules did not require a cross-check confirmation that appropriate blocking had been applied to protect the section of track closed for maintenance work (4.1.5). The absence of this requirement in the rules meant that the train controller's error went undetected, leading to the incident (4.3.5, 5.2).
- name: Distractions in the Work Environment
  explanation: Distractions in the work environment constitute a safety theme, as the presence of unauthorized visitors in the train control cubicle could have distracted the train controller from conducting a final check of the train control diagram before authorizing the final movement (4.2.7). Although their presence did not influence the initial error, it is concerning that such visits were allowed contrary to company rules, indicating a potential safety risk (4.2.7).
