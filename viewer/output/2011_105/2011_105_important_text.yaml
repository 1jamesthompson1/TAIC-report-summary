  \  The train controller made error s that resulted in his wrong -routing the freight\
  \ train from  the open \nsouthbound track across to the closed northbound track\
  \ , which  was obstructed by the mobile \ncrane . \n4.1.2.  Transport systems should\
  \ be de signed to mitigate the risk of h uman error .  Human error  is not \nsomething\
  \ tha t can be totally eliminated.  \n4.1.3.  In this case  the train controller's\
  \ error s could have been detected if in the first instance he had \nused control\
  \ blocking of the signals that protected  the closed section of track, and in the\
  \ second \ninstance if he had been required to  cross -check  with the person -in-charge\
  \ that control blocking was \nin place . \n4.1.4.  The train driver also had the\
  \ opportunity to avert the incident.  He was aware that his train should \nhave\
  \ been continuing to Westfield on the southbound track , but he did not voice his\
  \ concern to the \ntrain controlle r when the train controller told him that the\
  \  route  ahead had been set for  his train to \ncross back onto the northbound\
  \ track . \n4.1.5.  The following analysis discusses the reasons for the train controller's\
  \ error s, and raises 3 safety \nissues:  \n\uF0B7 the KiwiRail rules did  not require\
  \ a cross -check confirmation that appropriate blocking had \nbeen applied to protect\
  \ the section of track closed for maintenance work  \n\uF0B7 the train driver was\
  \ reluctant to, and did not , challenge the train controller when he was given \n\
  an instruction that he thought was not correct  \n\uF0B7 the information provided\
  \ in special work bulletins was not clear.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The\
  \ handover between the 2 train controllers was uneventful and the track closu re/wrong\
  \ -line-\nrunning detail was acknowledged verbally during the process.  The train\
  \ controller was made fully \naware during the handover that the work area on the\
  \ northbound track  extended from Papakura to \nWestfield.  \n4.2.2.  KiwiRail procedures\
  \ for train control stated that before starting duty each train controller must\
  \ read \nand understand all bulletins, instructions and information relevant to\
  \ the shift.  The train \ncontrollers were to show that they had done this  by signing\
  \ the train control diagram when  they \ntook over the shift6.  The train controller\
  \ signed the train control diagram when he accepted the \nshift.  At that time the\
  \ work area extending from Papakura to Westfield  had already been marked  in \n\
  coloured pencil  on the train control diagram . \n4.2.3.  When the train controller\
  \ issued the permit7 closing the section of the northbound track  between \nPapakura\
  \ and Westfield, he correctly marked in pen  the limits on the train control diagram\
  \ , as he \nwas required to do .  This was 2 hours and 20 minutes before he marked\
  \  the in tended route for the \nfreight train up to  Wiri Junction  only. \n  \n\
  \                                                        \n6  KiwiRail procedures\
  \ for Tr ain Control, Section 3.0 Duties of train controllers . \n7 Rule 24, Mis\
  \ .60 procedures . \n  \nFinal report  11-105 \n<< Page 9 >>\n 4.2.4.  At some time\
  \ during that 2 hours and 20 minutes the train controller developed a mind -set\
  \ that the \nwork area and closed section of track ended at Wiri Junction , instead\
  \ of Westfield.  The train \ncontroller mentioned that he had been on duty during\
  \ a similar major work occupation the previous \nweekend.  On that occasion the\
  \ work area ended at Wiri Junction.  It is possible that this could \nhave influenced\
  \ his thinkin g on the day.  Nevertheless, had he been monitoring his train control\
  \ \ndiagram as he was required to do, he would have seen that the closure extended\
  \ to Westfield on \nthis occasion.  \n4.2.5.  The special work bulletin covering\
  \ the work closure also referred to Westfie ld as the northern lim it \nof the work\
  \ area.  However,  it was not clea rly expressed and required interpretation by\
  \ the reader \nto establish the overall limits.  This safety issue is discussed\
  \ in a following section . \n4.2.6.  The Commission considered whether the unaut\
  \ horised visitors in train control could have been a \ndistracting influence. \
  \ The train controller had already made preparations for the freight train to re\
  \ -\njoin the closed track  at Wiri Junction before receiving the unauthorised visitors\
  \ in the train contro l \ncubicle.  Their presence therefore is unlikely to have\
  \ influenced his thinking that the work area \nextended only as far as Wiri Junction\
  \ . \n4.2.7.  However, the visitors  were present while he was authorising  the\
  \ freight train to pass  signals and \nblock entry boards shortly before informing\
  \  the driver that his train was routed across to the closed \ntrack  at Wiri Junction.\
  \  Their presence could have prevented him from conducting a final check of \nthe\
  \ train control diagram before authorising the final movement .  Regardles s of\
  \ their influence on \nthe incident, it is of concern that family and members of\
  \ the public were allowed to visit train \ncontrol contrary to  company rules. \
  \ \n4.3. Protection of work area  - Control blocking  \nSafety issue: KiwiRail's\
  \ general rule for track closure permits did not require a cross -check \nconfirmation\
  \ between a train controller and a person in charge of a work site that control\
  \ blocking \nprotection  for the work area  had been applied .  \n4.3.1.  KiwiRail\
  \ 's rules require train controllers to protect a gainst rail vehicles inadvertently\
  \ entering a \nwork area when a track closure permit is issued.  Rule 24 stated\
  \ in part that:  \nTrain control must arrange for signals at the entrance to the\
  \ affected section to be \nheld at Stop during the period the permit is i n operation.\
  \  If the panel is a computer \nbased system, a control tag must be entered for\
  \ the signal or station concerned.  \n4.3.2.  For some reason the controller  did\
  \ not apply blocking to any of the signals controlling entry  to the \nwork area.\
  \  Instead he applied bl ocking on the 2 signals controlling the exit from the work\
  \ area at \nPapakura and Westfield .  This meant that protection was applied to\
  \ prevent vehicles within the \nwork area from leaving at these 2 points, but not\
  \ against trains entering the work area.  \n4.3.3.  The third  entry point at Wiri\
  \ Junction was not protected either way.   This failure to apply any kind of \n\
  blocking to the points at Wiri Junction would normally be  consistent with a mind\
  \ -set that the work \narea only extended as far as Wiri Junction.  However, at\
  \ the same time that the train controller \nshould have applied control blocking\
  \ at Wiri Junction, he had applied control blocking at Westfield, \nalbeit in the\
  \ wrong direction.  The train controller was at a loss to explain these lapses .\
  \ \n4.3.4.  The KiwiRail \"900 serie s of track protection rules \" had been revised\
  \ in November 2008  to include \nthe requirement for the persons in charge of smaller\
  \ work areas to cross -check with train control \nthat the signals protecting their\
  \ work area had been blocked.  The 900 series of rul es was typically \nused for\
  \ smaller work areas that were within the local Channel one radio coverage.  \n\
  4.3.5.  However, Rule 24 outlined  protection arrangements for larger work areas\
  \ like the one involved in \nthis incident .  It had not been revised in the same\
  \ way.  C onsequently, there was no requirement \nfor the person in charge of the\
  \ work area between Papakura and Westfield , and th e train controller , \nto confirm\
  \ that the required signals /points  had been blocked.  This was a serious oversight.\
  \  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report 11 -105 4.3.6.  The oversight meant that\
  \ an error made by one person ( the train controller) went undetected for \nmore\
  \ than 2 hours until the incident occurred.  Following this inci dent KiwiRail immediately\
  \ \namend ed Rule 24 to require the same cross -check required of the 900 series\
  \ of rules (refer t o \nSafety action s section of this report).  \nFindings:  \n\
  1. The potential collision between the freight train and a mobile crane was the\
  \ result of \nthe train controller making  2 errors:  \n\uF0B7 he thought that the\
  \ limits of the work area and closed section of track \nextended only as far as\
  \ Wiri Junction because he did not check his train \ncontrol diagram  \n\uF0B7 he\
  \ did not apply the required control blocking to  signals preventing trains \nfrom\
  \ entering the work area.  \n2. The train controller's error s went unnoticed for\
  \ more than 2 h ours because KiwiRail's \nrules for track closure permits did not\
  \ require the person -in-charge to confirm with the \ntrain controller that control\
  \ blocking had been applied to protect the work area . \n4.4. Crew resource management\
  \  \nSafety issue: The train driver did not challenge the train controller when\
  \ told by him that his train \nwas routed to cross over onto what he had known was\
  \ a section of track closed for maintenance \nwork . \n4.4.1.  KiwiRail described\
  \ its crew resource management practices as \"using available staff within a group\
  \ \ninvolved with a specific task or operation to improve safety .  A safe and efficient\
  \ operation is one \nwhere all participants (the crew) are aware of the plan and\
  \ then use all available resources to \nexecute it safely and efficiently \".  Plans\
  \ can and do change, which should not be  an issue  as long \nas those involved\
  \ are aware of the change.  \n4.4.2.  In this case the plan was described in the\
  \ special bulletin.  The train controller, the people involved \nin protecting the\
  \ work area and the train dr iver all read and understood the operating \narrangements\
  \ around the work area.  There were no changes to that original plan.  \n4.4.3.\
  \  The train driver said later that he was \"alarmed\" when he was told by the train\
  \ controller that the \nroute had been set for his train  to cross over to the northbound\
  \ track  at Wiri Junction.  He was \nalarmed because he was expecting to continue\
  \ on the open southbound track  to Westfield, which \nhad just been verified by\
  \ the rail protection officer 5 minutes befor ehand , when he had stopped h is \n\
  train at the compulsory stop board.  \n4.4.4.  The driver later said that he did\
  \ not challenge the train controller because he knew him to be a \nsenior and experienced\
  \ controller who had authority to amend the plan.  A challenge at th at point \n\
  could well have influe nced the train controller to check his train control diagram\
  \  and other \ndocuments .  The potential collision would have been averted.  \n\
  4.4.5.  The Commission has been alerting the rail industry for several years about\
  \ the need to fully \nembrace and promote the concept  of crew resource management\
  \ , including good communication , \nas a means of improving safety  across the\
  \ rail industry . \n  \n  \nFinal report  11-105 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.4.6.  The most\
  \ recent was o n 28 March 2012, when the Commission made a recommendation8 to the\
  \ \nChief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that  the National Rail System Standard\
  \  executive \ndevelop standards to ensure that all rail participants meet a consistently\
  \ high level of crew \nresource management and  communication that includes the\
  \ use of standard rail phraseology .  A \nstandard has yet to be developed.  Consequently\
  \ the safety recommendation still has an open \nstatus at the time this report was\
  \ published . \nFinding:  \n3. The train driver had the opportunity to avert the\
  \ potential collision between his train \nand the mobile crane by challenging the\
  \ trai n controller's information that the route \nwas set for his train to cross\
  \ over to the northbound track  (to enter the closed work \narea ). \n4.5. Presentation\
  \  of bulletins  \nSafety issue : The special bulletin outlining the plan for the\
  \ major infrastructure and maintenance \nwork did not present information to maintenance\
  \ and operational staff in a clear and logical \nformat.  \n4.5.1.  KiwiRail defined\
  \ a bulletin, including special bulletins, as a document containing supplementary\
  \ \ninformation to documented rules and regulation s, such as some of its track\
  \ safety rules in this \ninstance.  \n4.5.2.  KiwiRail had  standards for the format,\
  \ content, layout and the inclusion or otherwise of information \nin bulletins.\
  \  KiwiRail s tated  that bulletins must be clearly set out, readily understood\
  \ and not over -\npadded with information already contained in rules and regulations.\
  \  \n4.5.3.  This special bulletin contained a lot of information for several different\
  \ stakeholders:  \n\uF0B7 track maintenance staff (i ncluding maintenance vehicle\
  \ operators and contractors)  \n\uF0B7 work site protection staff  \n\uF0B7 train\
  \ controllers  \n\uF0B7 train drivers . \n4.5.4.  The instructions were not intuitive\
  \ for train drivers and train controllers.  The train driver said that \nhe had\
  \ to read the special bulletin  several times before he understood how his train\
  \ would be \naffected  because information relevant to train operations between\
  \ Papakura and Westfield \"was \nnot all together ; was across several pages; and\
  \ didn't flow\".  \n4.5.5.  For the train controller the information related to\
  \ the wrong -line-running of trains between \nPapakura and Westfield was contained\
  \ on several pages.  The relevant instructions were on the \nbottom of \n<< page\
  \ 2 >>\n and the top of \n<< page 4 >>\n ( highlighted in Appendix 1).   Information\
  \ specific to \nsignalling arrang ements at Wiri and Wiri Junction was repeated\
  \ 4 times on the first 4 pages of the \nbulletin.  Without careful reading, it would\
  \ be feasible for a train controller to mistake the limits of \nthe work area as\
  \ Wiri rather than Westfield.  \n4.5.6.  In such cases it would b e helpful to have\
  \ a section dedicated to each of the stakeholders to avoid \nany confusion or ambiguity.\
  \  \n  \n                                                        \n8 Commissi on\
  \ report 11 -101 Papakura -Wiri, Recommendation 002/12.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n\
  \ Final report 11 -105 4.5.7.  On 5 September 2011 risk and safety management solution\
  \ consultan ts produced a report that \nKiwiRail had commissioned on the matter\
  \ of rail construction , safety and efficiency.   The \nconsultancy report concluded\
  \ by recommending that KiwiRail reviews and updates the processes \nand technology\
  \ used in preparing and distributing the bulletins issued by the network control\
  \ \ncentre in Wellington.  \n4.5.8.  On 26 October 201 2 the Commission made a recommendation\
  \ to the Chief Executive  of the NZ \nTransport Agency in its Tamaki rail inquiry9\
  \ report that he ensures bulletins that convey critical \ninformation to rail participants\
  \ are presented in a clear and unambiguous way.  \n4.5.9.  The NZ  Transport Agency\
  \ accepted the recommendation.  Joint KiwiRail and NZ Transport Agency \nmeetings\
  \ held during  2013 acknowledged that there was \"a lot of information given out\
  \ to staff \nthat don't need it (such as train drivers) and it is important that\
  \ information is targeted to the \naudience\".  \n4.5.10.  Following this incident\
  \  KiwiRail took some safety action with its bulle tin processes (refer to Safety\
  \ \nactions section of this report).  At the time of publication of this report\
  \ the Commission's \nrecommendation still had an \"open \" status.  \nFinding: \
  \ \n4. The special bulletin outlining the plan for the major infrastructure and\
  \ maintenance \nwork did not present information to maintenance and operational\
  \ staff in a clear and \nlogical format.  \n   \n                              \
