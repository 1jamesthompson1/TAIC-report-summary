  \ be a safe pilot, a person needs to possess both ability and skill .25 There are\
  \ a range  \nof traits that underpin this, including:  \n\u2022 attention to detail\
  \  - small mistakes can make a big impact , be it a checklist \nitem or knowing\
  \ what the wind is doing  \n\u2022 self-confidence  - the willingness and ability\
  \ to take  control of a situation  and \nnot let it get further out of control ,\
  \ but not be over -confi dent, allied with the \nability to remain calm under pressure\
  \  \n\u2022 situational awareness  - an accurate understanding of what is going\
  \ on  and \nprojecting forward  \n\u2022 humility  - knowing one's limitations ,\
  \ admitting mistakes  and that there's \nalways room for improvement  \n\u2022 good\
  \ communication skil ls - the ability to accurately and clearly transmit and \n\
  receive information  \n\u2022 knowledge and the d esire to lear n - knowledge of\
  \ the aircraft being flown, \nthe operating rules and t he willingness to continue\
  \ improv ing personal \nknowledge and skills .26  \n3.2. Many of these characteristics\
  \ relate to personal attitudes  and abilities  that may be \nchallenging  to change\
  \ . However, through training and experience a pilot should gain \nknowledge and\
  \ become increasingly  skilful  and safe.  \n3.3. This accident occurred on what\
  \ would be described as a good day for flying. It also \ninvolved a newly qualified\
  \ private pilot in the early stages of their flying experience. \nPilot experience\
  \ has often been equated to the number of flying hours a pilo t has \nflown. This\
  \ ignores the quality aspect of the flight time.  Pilot qualification s are \ntherefore\
  \ both competency - and experience -based. A pilot must not only a ccrue a \nminimum\
  \ number of hours for a particular licence or rating, but also demonstrate to a\
  \ \nflight examiner that they have the competency to safely fly an aircraft in accordance\
  \ \nwith the rules and limitations, both aircraft and personal . \n3.4. The following\
  \ analyses the circumstances surrounding the event , including pilot \nexperience,\
  \ to identify those factors  that increased the likelihood of the event \noccurring\
  \ or increased the severity of its outcome. It also examines any safety issues \n\
  that have the potential to adversely affect future operations.  \nWhat happened\
  \  \n3.5. The purpose of the flight was for the pi lot to fly the ir family and\
  \ a friend from near \nRangiora to  Kekerengu for lunch and return. The weather\
  \ was suitable for the flight , \n \n25 Abilities are inherent or inherited  characteristics\
  \ that enable a person to accomplish or perform a given action . \nSkills are activities\
  \ that have been either learnt or acquired  and result in a predictable  and often\
  \ better outcome .  \n26 Qualities identified by a range of organisations , including\
  \ the United States Airc raft Owners and Pilots \nAssociation and S kybrary.  \n\
  \ \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2020 -003  with essentially clear skies and\
  \ a light -to-moderate northe asterly onshore  wind . The \nflight north proceeded\
  \ without incident until approaching  Kekerengu . \n3.6. Approaching Kekerengu ,\
  \ the pilot positioned the helicopter out to se a before turning  \nleft to place\
  \ the intended landing area on the right side of the helicopter.  This would \n\
  have enable d the pilot to have  an unrestricte d view of the landing area, to check\
  \ it was \nsuitable and clear.  \n3.7. As the pilot continued the turn back towards\
  \ the shore a second time, the helicopter \nslowed  and started to yaw to the left.\
  \ The rate of yaw increased  and the helicopter \ndescended rapidly , crashing into\
  \ the beach in a steep nose -down attitude. The three \nchildren on board suffered\
  \ moderate -to-serious injuries , but the pilot and the second \nadult in the rear\
  \ seat did not survive.    \nMechanical and medical factors  \n3.8. Witness es described\
  \ the helicopt er suddenly and rapidly yawing to the left as it \napproached the\
  \ beach. This was not normal and indicates that there was a loss of \ncontrol, \
  \ possibly  because of either a mechanical problem or pilot incapacitation.   \n\
  Mechanical  \n3.9. The damage to the airframe was consistent with the helicopter\
  \ crashing onto the \nbeach nose first, stopping the rotation of the main rotor\
  \ and transmission  and severely \ndistorting the cabin . The damage to the main\
  \ rotor blades, rotor head and the tip \nweight  of one of the blades puncturing\
  \ a hole in the bridge guardrail some 230 m \naway all confirm that the main rotor\
  \ was operating at high speed when it struck the \nbeach.  \n3.10. The above evidence\
  \ is supported by the analysis of the video recordings , which  \ncaptured b oth\
  \ main rotor and tail rotor speeds. These confirm that both were \noperating at\
  \ their designed speeds as the helicopter descended and crashed onto the \nbeach.\
  \  \n3.11. Immediately after the main rotor blades struck the beach , the engine\
  \ continued to try \nto drive th e transmission, resulting in the coupling between\
  \ the two breaking. The \nunrestrained engine then oversped . This resulted in the\
  \ high -pitched noise , the \ntransmission coupling displaying evidence of overheating\
  \ and the light-coloured \nsmoke observed by the wi tnesses immediately after impact.\
  \  \n3.12. The absence of damage to the rear of th e helicopter , in particular\
  \ the  tail rotor blades , \ndoes not indicate there was a problem with the tail\
  \ rotor. The sudden stoppage of the \nmain rotor combined with the mass of the still\
  \ turning tail rotor caused the tail rotor \ndrive shaft from the transmission to\
  \ break . The score marks inside the tail boom show \nthat the tail rotor and the\
  \ section of connected  drive shaft  conti nued to rotate for \nseveral revolutions\
  \ after the initial impact of the main rotor.  The direction of the break \nand\
  \ score marks support this sequence of events.  \n3.13. There was no evidence of\
  \ a pre -existing fault that may have contributed to the loss of \ncontrol . The\
  \ flight controls, including the tail rotor controls , function ed as designed.\
  \  \n3.14. The position  of the left front seat  (nearly fully aft ) and tail rotor\
  \ pedals (fully  forward) \nmeant that it was exceptionally unlikely  that the occupant\
  \ of this seat could have \ninterfered with the controls.  \n   \n  Final Report\
  \ AO -2020 -003 \n<< Page 17 >>\n Medical  \n3.15. There was no evidence of any\
  \ form of pilot incapacit ation. Wreckage evidence , autopsy \nresults, toxicology\
  \  and w itness accounts, including from survivors , indicate it was very \nlikely\
  \  that the pilot was operating the flight control s at the time of impact.  However,\
  \ \nsome form of partial  incapacitation  in the final seconds could not be fully\
  \ excluded.  \n3.16. The possibility of a bird strike affecting the pilot or helicopter\
  \ was considered \nexceptionally unlikely . There was no evidence found of a bird\
  \ strike  and no witnesses \nor survivors reporting seeing birds close to the helicopter.\
  \ The slow speed of the \nhelico pter as it approached the beach the second time\
  \ was considered too slow for a \nbird strike  that could cause an y damage or injury.\
  \ \n3.17. Pilot age is discussed further in paragraph 3.56.   \nHelicopter design\
  \  \n3.18. The unique advantage o f a helicopter is its ability to operate in remote\
  \ and confined \nlanding sites. However, helicopter design and performance vary\
  \ significantly  between \ndifferent types , resulting in a wide range of handling\
  \ or operating characteristics.  \n3.19. The EC120 -B, like the  Cabri the pilot\
  \ initially trained on,  was fitted with a Fenestron tail \nrotor . The Fen estron\
  \ is a multi -bladed ducted fan placed in the tail of a helicopter. The \nFenestron\
  \ offers  some a dvantages over a conventional tail rotor, including : \n\u2022\
  \ increased safety  - the tail rotor blades are surrounded by ducting or a fairing\
  \ \nthat provides i ncrease d protection and safety on or near the ground  \n\u2022\
  \ increase d efficiency  - the fairing reduces tip vort ices on the ends of the\
  \ blades \nand increases the slipstream  effect of the tail during cruise   \n\u2022\
  \ reduced noise levels  - the larger number of blades27 at different s pacings \n\
  spread and reduce noise levels.   \n3.20. The Fen estron also has some disadvantages\
  \ , including:  \n\u2022 increase d weight  and drag  - the ducted fan is heav ier\
  \ and larger than a \nconventional two- or four -bladed  tail rotor   \n\u2022 increased\
  \ cost  - a Fenestron is  more expensive to construct    \n\u2022 more power required\
  \  at low speeds  - this is particularly so in the hover.  \n3.21. Regardless of\
  \ which design pilots fly, tail rotor input is still required for changes in \n\
  airspeed and power  to counter the main rotor to rque effect.  \n3.22. From a pilot's\
  \ perspective , the designed differences between a Fenestron tail rotor and \na\
  \ conventional tail rotor are most noticeable in the tail rotor peda l inputs required\
  \  as a \nhelicopter is accelerated  from a hover  to cruise flight and back to\
  \ a hover. For a \nconventional tail rotor , the relationship between tail rotor\
  \ pedal input and tail rotor \nthrust is near linear. By comparison, when a Fenestron\
  \  equippe d helicopter  is slowed to \nthe hover , a pilot needs to apply a larger\
  \ amount of tail ro tor pedal for the same \namount of tail rotor thrust  (see figure\
  \ 7 ). \n \n27 ZK-HEK was fitted with eight tail rotor blades.  \n \n\n<< Page 18\
  \ >>\n Final Report AO -2020 -003  3.23. The helicopter starting to yaw left as\
  \ it fl ew towards the beach a second time was \nsymptomatic of insufficient tail\
  \ rotor thrust , and not enough right pedal being applied \nto counter the torque\
  \ effect of the main rotor as the helicopter slowed .  \nAccidents related to Fenestron\
  \ tail rotors  \n3.24. The accidents d escribed in appendix 2 are examples of unanticipated\
  \ yaw  that \noccurred as the helicopters were moving very slowly , often when approaching\
  \ land . In \naddition to the accidents described, there have been numerous other\
  \ accident s \ninvolving Fenestron  equipped helicopters.  \n3.25. The investigation\
  \ reports for the unanticipated yaw accidents involving Fenestron  tail \nrotors\
  \ identi fied a range of causes. These included pilots who had previously flown\
  \ \nhelicopters with a main rotor that turned in the opposition d irection and as\
  \ a result \nhad subconsciously applied the incorrect pedal as the helicopter was\
  \ slowed. There \nwere accidents where pilots had not anticipated the requirement\
  \ for more right pedal \ninput as they slowed down. As a result,  the helicopter\
  \ s started  yawing left and the \npilots possibly became  disorientated and/or\
  \ did not apply a full right pedal  to counter \nthe yaw.  \n3.26. In the investigation\
  \ of an unanticipated yaw accident in 2015 involving an EC130 \nhelicopter ,28 the\
  \ BEA conducted a simulation to determine  the effectiveness of the tail \nrotor\
  \ in recovering from the situation. The report stated:  \nA flight on a helicopter\
  \ of the same type under similar conditions but at an \naltitude  of 500 ft was\
  \ used to evaluate the effect of the Fenestron tail rotor on \nthe yaw rate. At\
  \ an angular rate to the left of 100 degrees per second (when the \npilot begins\
  \ to decrease the collective pitch to land the aircraft), pushing the \nright rudder\
  \ pedal to  70% of its travel stops the yaw rotation of the aircraft in \nthree\
  \ seconds.29    \n3.27. The video recording of ZK-HEK shows that the rate of yaw\
  \ increased  from when it first \nstarted to turn  and continued until it descended\
  \ from view behind b ushes. The yaw \nrate fo r the first full turn was determined\
  \ to average about 90\xB0 per second , increasing \nto over 120\xB0 per second \
  \ for the second full turn . The yaw rate was approaching 180 \xB0 \nper second\
  \ for the last h alf turn before the helicopter went from  view.   \nDownwind approaches\
  \  \n3.28. It is preferable to land any aircraft into wind , as this assists in\
  \ the control of the aircraft . \nMany of the accidents described the helicopters\
  \ approaching the landing areas either \ndownwind or crosswind30. This had the potential\
  \ to affect the h elicopters in several \nways.  For a downwind approach,  a helicopter's\
  \ airspeed would be less than its \ngroundspeed. This would result in more power\
  \ required earlier in the approach . An \nincrease in power causing an increase\
  \ in main rotor torque would result in  the \nhelicopter yawing.  If pilot s were\
  \ not prepared for this, perhaps by not using the \navailable visual cues , it could\
  \ catch them un awares .   \n3.29. A second effect of  not approaching a landing\
  \ site directly into wind  is direction al \ncontrol.  As a helicopter slows and\
  \ airspeed reduces, the slipstream design of a \n \n28 Similar to the EC120 -B,\
  \ but larger . \n29 BEA Investigation Report 0647: Accident involving Airbus Helicopter\
  \ EC130 B4 registered F -GOLH on 24 \nOctober  2015 at Meg \xE8ve (74) . \n30 Wind\
  \ direction from the side.  \n   \n  Final Report AO -2020 -003 \n<< Page 19 >>\n\
  \ helicopter will result in it trying to turn into the prevailing wind if no pilot\
  \ action is \ntaken .  \n3.30. For an out -of-wind approach, t he requirement for\
  \ increased power  and directional \nstabi lity can occur simultaneously. This can\
  \ result in a helicopter suddenly yawing , \nstartling a pilot. This startle effect\
  \ was cited in several investigations where there \nappeared to be no recovery action\
  \ taken after the initial yaw.  In this accident, there was \nno obvious recovery\
  \ action initiated and the  rate of yaw continued to increase  as the \nhelicopter\
  \ descended . It therefore indicates that the pilot was very likely  startled by\
  \ \nthe initial sudden left yaw.31 \n3.31. Out-of-wind approaches, however, can\
  \ offe r some advantages. For a helicopter with a \nmain rotor that turns clockwise,\
  \ like ZK -HEK, approaching a landing area with the wind \non the right side of\
  \ a helicopter can reduce the power required for an approach . As the \nhelicopter\
  \ is slowed, it will attempt to yaw right into the prevailing wind. This results\
  \ in \na pilot needing to use left pedal to continue to align the helicopter with\
  \ the approach \npath. Left pedal reduces the power demand on the engine. It also\
  \ ensures there is \nsufficient right pedal availabl e when power is increased approach\
  \ ing the hover  (see \nfigure  8). \n3.32. However, pilots need to be careful when\
  \ performing this manoeuvre. If directional \ncontrol is not maintained, a helicopter\
  \ could yaw left sufficiently to then place the wind \non its left side. This would\
  \ cause the yaw rate to suddenly increase  further .  \nResponse of m anufacturer\
  \ s  \n3.33. Emergency training is an integral part of gaining a pilot licence qualification\
  \ and \naircraft type training . For helicopters , this includes various tail rotor\
  \ emergences that \nmight occur , such as jammed pedals or loss of tail rotor thrust.\
  \ The incidence of \nunanticipated yaw accidents , including those involving Fenestron\
  \ tail rotors , resulted  in \nmanufacturers , regulators and safety organisations\
  \ providing safety notices  and \neducational and training material , to help better\
  \ prepare pilots for this eventuality  \nshould it occur . The manufacturers of\
  \ the Cabri and EC120 -B types of helicopter s were \nno different.  See paragra\
  \ phs 2.58 to 2.65 . \n3.34. The investigation into this accident determined it\
  \ was very likely  the pilot of ZK -HEK \nwas informed and trained in various tail\
  \ rotor emergencies, including unanticipated \nyaw scenarios. The training included\
  \  the pilot need ing to anticipate the requirement of \nright pedal as power was\
  \ increased when a helicopter  took off or approached land ing. \nAlso, should an\
  \ unanticipated yaw event occur, the pilot should apply full right pedal \nand,\
  \ if possible , reduce power and/or fly away.  \n \n31 For further information on\
  \ the startle effect see https://skybrary.aero/  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report\
  \ AO -2020 -003   \nFigure 8: Tail rotor control  \n(Credit:  Airbus Helicopters\
  \ ) \n3.35. However, to be able to safe ly escape an unanticipated yaw event, a\
  \ pilot also needed \nto be able to recognise it and react immedi ately and appropriately.\
  \  Early in a pilot's \nflying, the response was likely  to be very mechanical ,\
  \ which  meant  that they would \nfirst need to recognise the yaw before determining\
  \ what action was required and then \napplying right pedal. With training and experience,\
  \ this would become more intuitive , \nwith a pilot anticipating the need for pedal\
  \ input.  For further information on the \nFenestron tail rotor, see the Citations\
  \  section .  \nPilot training  \nQualifications  \n3.36. The pil ot of ZK -HEK\
  \ held a private pilot licence and at the time of the accident had \nflown  a total\
  \ of 1 69.5 hours, including 32 hours on the EC120 -B. The pilot was \ntherefore\
  \ deemed legally able  to fly the helicopter  but was still in the early stages\
  \ of \ngaining experience. However , as discussed in paragraph  3.3, flying hours\
  \ alone do not \ntell the full story.  \n3.37. To obtain the private pilot licence\
  \  (helicopter) , the pilot was required  to have flown a \ntotal of at least 50\
  \ hours . This includ ed 20 hours o f dual instruct ion, 15 hours solo  and \nfive\
  \ hours of mountain flying .32 The pilot then needed to complete a flight te st\
  \ with an \n \n32 CAA Advisory Circular AC61-3 Pilot Licences  and Ratings - Private\
  \ pilot licence .  \n\n   \n  Final Report AO -2020 -003 \n<< Page 21 >>\n appropriately\
  \ qualified instructor or flight examiner. The pilot met these requirements \nwith\
  \ a total of 84.5 hours. The next flight  after the flight test , nearly two weeks\
  \ later , \nwas with an instructor and included training  on several more advanced\
  \ manoeuvres.   \n3.38. The pilot, after obtaining their licence, flew a further\
  \ 85 hours before the accident. This \nincluded some 42 hours after completing the\
  \ type rating on the EC120 -B. The 42 hours \nwere spread over about 24 flights\
  \ and included cross -country flights with passengers, \noften to off -aerodrome\
  \ landing sites, and additional advanced training with instructors. \nThe pilot\
  \ had recently ha d the second set of flight controls installed in anticipation\
  \ of \nfurther training.  \n3.39. To obtain the type rating on the EC120 -B type\
  \ helicopter, the pilot was required to  \npass a 'basic turbine knowledge examination',\
  \ show  satisfactory technical knowledge of \nthe aircraft , fly one hour of instruction\
  \ a nd demonstrate appropriate pilot skills.33 The \npilot obtained their type rating\
  \ after having flown 7.7 hours  with an instructor . The \npilot then flew a further\
  \ 4.3 hours  with the instructor before completing their fi rst flight \nas pilot-in-command.\
  \ The pilot's logbook records that the 4.3 hours  included  heavy -\nweight , high-altitude\
  \ landings  and mountain flying . \n3.40. The number of hours the pilot flew before\
  \ obt aining their  licence and type rating \nexceeded the minimum requirement.\
  \ However, this was not considered to be a \nconsequence of  the pilot's ability\
  \  or skill. Rather , it reflected the pilot's availability to \nundertake training\
  \ and , according to those who were involved in the training, their \nwish to be\
  \ competent  and safe .   \nTraining  \n3.41. The pilot's instructor and flight\
  \ examiner both described the pilot as a good  or average \nprivate pilot. They\
  \ considered the pilot to be conscientious, had listened to advice and \nwas keen\
  \ to learn. Evidence was provided that soon after obtaining their licence, the \n\
  pilot was considering purchasing an AS350 Squirrel helicopter . The training provider\
  \ \ndissuaded the pilot from this, recommend ing that it would be \"very benefi\
  \ cial to get \nexperience before going to a bigger machine .\" The pilot subsequently\
  \ trialled the \nsmaller EC120 -B a month later.    \n3.42. The pilot's training\
  \ records  and l ogbook recorded that they received instruction on , \namong other\
  \ topics, crosswind operations, wind awareness, confined areas, mountain \noperation\
  \ s, cross -country , hazards and emergencies.  The logbook record ed that the \n\
  pilot had not landed at Kekerengu before , but had flown past it on at least four\
  \ \noccasions.  The most recent time was two months before the accident flight.\
  \  The \ntraining provider advised that the pilot was competent in cross -country\
  \ flying and \noperating into remote , but easily accessible , landing sites.  \n\

  \ During helicopter training  for remote, confined -area34 or off -aerodrome operations\
  \ , \npilots are instructed to conduct  reconnaissance or recce passes to determine\
  \ that the \nsite is suitable to approac h and land. Pilot s will typically use\
  \ the acronym of the '7 Ss' \nto help in the assessment.35 These are:  \n\u2022\
  \ Size - is it big eno ugh (subject to experience) ? \n\u2022 Shape  - does the\
  \ shape favour an approach from a particular direction  (wind)? \n\u2022 Slope \
  \ - is the ground level enough for landing?  \n\u2022 Surface  - what is the surface\
  \ of the area ? are there any hidden hazards  or \ncould the surface be a hazard,\
  \ such as dust or snow?  \n\u2022 Surrounds  - is the area around the landing site\
  \ free of hazards, including \napproach and departure paths  (wires)? \n\u2022 Sun\
  \ - might t he sun  restrict visibility on final approach or hide  hazards lurking\
  \ \nin the shadows ? \n\u2022 Select  - choose the touchdown spot.36 \n3.44. Early\
  \ in a helicopter pilot's training, the assessment of the intended landing sit e\
  \ would \nbe performed over several  passes, typically referred to as an initial\
  \ or high rec ce and a \nlow recce . With experience and competence, the number\
  \ of passes may be reduced . \nWind  \n3.45. Fundamental to the assessment is knowing\
  \ the wind direction . There was amp le \nopportunity for the pilot of ZK -HEZ to\
  \ be able to assess  the wind conditions during the \nflight north.37 The approach\
  \ and departure paths the pilot flew at their home base and \nRangiora were all\
  \ flown into the same north easterly wind.  \n3.46. The northerly onshore wind was\
  \ constant along the coast . The pilot would likely  have \nhad good indications\
  \ of this , either visually or by comparing indicated  airspeed \nreadings  with\
  \ the various navigation groundspeed  displays available  as the flight \nprogressed\
  \ n orth.  \n3.47. Approaching Kekerengu, the wind was strong eno ugh to generate\
  \ white -caps, and \nvery likely  other indications  on the water or bushes . There\
  \ was also a dark -coloured \nflag on a pole above the caf\xE9 building. The presence\
  \ of white -caps indicates  a wind \nvelocity of between 10 and 15 knots was present\
  \ . These potential indicators should \nhave left the pilot in no doubt about  the\
  \ wind direction at the landing site.  \n3.48. The optimal approach to the landing\
  \ area in the conditions would have been directly \nfrom the south. This would have\
  \ kept the flightpath clear of the road and building s. It \nwould also have placed\
  \ the wind to the front right of the helicopter , possibl y slightly to \nthe right\
  \ , thereby ensuring th at there  was ample power and pedal con trol available .\
  \  \n \n34 A 'confined area ' is a site where the flightpath of a helicopter is\
  \ limited by terrain and/or obstructions.   \n35 CASA Australia and CAA New Zealand\
  \ Helicopter Flight Instructor Manual , Issue 3, March  2012.  \n36 For aeroplane\
  \ s an eighth  'S' could apply - Stock  (cattle or sheep grazing on a grass airstrip)\
  \ . \n37 Such indicators might include the Christchurch terminal weather report\
  \ broadcast over the radio, windsocks  at \nRangiora  and possibl y smoke or dust\
  \ along the route . \n   \n  Final Report AO -2020 -003 \n<< Page 23 >>\n Pilot\
  \ intentions    \n3.49. In preparation for the flight the pilot had contacted staff\
  \ at the caf\xE9 to confirm the \nweather conditions were suitable  for it, which\
  \ they were. The pilot had flown past \nKekerengu before , but never landed there.\
  \ So, a fter reaching the area the pilot  \npositioned out to sea, turned left and\
  \ completed one pass of the intended landing \narea. The helicopter was being turned\
  \ back towards the beach  a second time when it \nsuddenly commenced yawing left.\
  \ The video recordings show the helicopter was nose \nlow as it started to yaw.\
  \ A nose -down attitude is an indicator  of a helicopter being \naccelerated into\
  \ forward flight  (see figure 9) .  \n3.50. It was therefore considered very likely\
  \  that the pilot was undertaking a second low -\nlevel reconnaissance of the landing\
  \ site when the helicopter  started to yaw . The pilot \nlikely  intend ed to fly\
  \ to the south for a short distance before reversing the turn and \napproaching\
  \ the landing area into the prevailing wind .  \n \nFigure 9: Helicopter attitude\
  \  \n(Credit: Airbus Helicopters)  \n3.51. The left turn towards the beach resulted\
  \ in  the helicopter flying  downwind . The result \nof the helicopter's airspeed\
  \ combined with the tailwind component  should have \ngenerated an increase in the\
  \ groundspeed compared with flying into wind . However, i f \na pilot is not alert\
  \ to this, there can be a n unintentional influence to maintain the same \nvisual\
  \ movement over the ground and so allow the airspeed to reduce . This is \nespecially\
  \ important  when flying at low levels  as the safety margins are reduced.  \n3.52.\
  \ In this case, t he tracking data shows the helicopter slowing as it turned downwind\
  \ . This \nwas indicative of the pilot not monitor ing the airspeed -groundspeed\
  \ relationship  by \nlooking at the airspeed indicator on the instrument panel.\
  \ It was therefore considered \nvery likely  that as the helicopter was turned towards\
  \ the beach the pilot was focused \non looking outside at the intended landing area\
  \  to confirm it was still suitable  and was \nnot aware of the reducing airspeed.\
  \  The reducing airspeed requir ed more power to \nremain level.  \n\n \n\n<< Page\
  \ 24 >>\n Final Report AO -2020 -003  3.53. The pilot  lowered the nose and increased\
  \ power to  accelerate away. This increase in \npower (and therefore torque ), combined\
  \ with the low airspeed and already high  power \nsetting, was sufficient to start\
  \ the helicopter yawing. The helicopter only had to yaw left \nthrough about 20\
  \ \xB0 before the wind started to come from the rear left side of the \nhelicopter.\
  \ Once the wind was on the left side , the rate of yaw would speed up further. \
  \ \nThis yaw, along with the nose of the helicopter rising up and then down as it\
  \ yawe d \nsuddenly and rapidly  about the rotor , would  have been sufficient to\
  \ startle and \ndisorientat e the pilot. As discussed in paragraph 3.30, this was\
  \ considered to be very \nlikely .   \n3.54. There was very likely  insufficient\
  \ height available for the pilot to reorientate \nthemselves and recover  by: \n\
  \u2022 levelling the attitude of the helicopter and  applying full right pedal \
  \ \n\u2022 lowering the collective  lever  to reduce the power and therefore the\
  \ rotation  \n\u2022 cyclic-ing away38 and increasing the forward speed of the helicopter\
  \ and \nslipstream effect  \n\u2022 a combination of the above.     \n3.55. The\
  \ pilot , instead of flying the left-hand pattern  out to sea, could have flown\
  \ a right -\nhand pattern  around the caf\xE9. This would have placed the  intended\
  \ la nding area on \nthe pilot's right , the side they were seated, while flying\
  \ into wind. Th e lower \ngroundspeed  would have given  the pilot more time to\
  \ assess the conditions . However, \nthe pilot may not have considered this practical\
  \ in the sit uation because of the steep \nterrain j ust west of the landing area\
  \ and it  would have resulted in the helicopter flying \nclose  to hous es and people.\
  \  \nPilot age  \n3.56. The pilot was aged 60  and started flying 18 months earlier.\
  \  While cognitive function \nmay decline with age, likely owing to a decrease in\
  \ working memory, there are many \nother human factors that can also affect pilot\
  \ performance , with  pilot attitude being a \nsignificant factor.  There was no\
  \ evidence that the pilot's age was a contributing factor \nto this accident.39\
  \ The pilot was considered by their instructor and training organisation \nto be\
  \ a diligent and keen student . This was demonstrated  by the pilot undertaking\
  \ \nadditional training  before and after obtaining their licence , listening to\
  \  the advice not \nto purchas e a large r AS350 helicopter  and planning further\
  \ training.         \nSurvivability  \n3.57. All five occupants were retained in\
  \ their seats following the helicopter crashing on the \nbeach.  Three children\
  \  survived the a ccident. The pilot seated in the front right  and the \nadult\
  \  seated in the rear left did not.  \n3.58. The force and angle of impact resulted\
  \ in the cabin being severely deformed. This \nreduced the survivable space available,\
  \ especially for the two adults . Also, the higher \nmass of the pilot , when compared\
  \ to the other occupants, resulted in greater distortion \n \n38 Moving the cyclic\
  \ control, normally forward, to accelerate the helicopter.  \n39 The Commission\
  \ investigated the role of pilot age in Inquiry 11 -007: Descent below instrument\
  \ approach \nminima, Christchurch International Airport, 29  October  2011.  \n\

  \ that the deceleration was not able to be absorbed by the \nseat to the same degree\
  \ .  \n3.59. The smaller physical size of the children meant that the disruption\
  \ to th e cabin was \nalso not as critical. There was still survivable space available.\
  \ Also , the smaller mass of \nthe three children meant that their seats were able\
  \ to better absorb the impact forces . \nNevertheless , they still sustained a range\
  \ of moderate -to-seriou s injuries.  The prompt \naction of the witnesses and emergency\
  \ services a ssisted in  managing  their injuries.   \n3.60. Airbus Helicopters'\
  \ a nalysis of the damage  determined that t he impact forces were  well \nbeyond\
  \ the level of crash protection for aircraft , including  for helicopter s, \nrecommended\
