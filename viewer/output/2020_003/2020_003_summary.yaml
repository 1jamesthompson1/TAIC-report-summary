- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 30
  explanation: The pilot "did not adequately monitor the performance of the helicopter, in particular the airspeed-groundspeed relationship, resulting in the helicopter slowing at a critical phase of the flight" (4.9 (invalid formatted quote)). This indicates a lapse in the pilot's judgment and situational awareness, which is a form of human error. The pilot's assumptions about the aircraft's performance during the critical phase of flight without adequate monitoring contributed to the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The pilot was "qualified, was in the early stages of gaining experience and skill" (4.1) and "was still in the early stages of gaining experience" (3.36). Although the pilot had completed the necessary training and had the required qualifications, their relative lack of experience likely contributed to the accident by affecting their ability to respond effectively to the unexpected yaw.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The pilot's situational awareness was compromised as they "were unable to regain control before the helicopter struck the beach" (4.5 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and they likely "were not aware of the reducing airspeed" as the helicopter was turned towards the beach (3.52). The loss of situational awareness was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot's actions during the flight suggest a deviation from optimal safety procedures, such as the decision to turn downwind towards the beach, which is not the preferred approach for landing (3.28, 3.51). This deviation from safety procedures likely contributed to the accident.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'While there is no direct mention of CRM issues in the document, the pilot''s ability to manage the resources available, including their own skills and the helicopter''s capabilities, may have been a factor. The lack of an effective response to the uncontrolled yaw suggests a potential shortfall in CRM practices.

    '
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'The pilot''s decision-making and actions reflect the safety culture of the organization and their training. The pilot''s relative inexperience and the potential lack of emphasis on certain safety aspects during training could be indicative of organizational safety culture influences.

    '
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's lack of experience and the decision to fly downwind for a landing approach suggest that there may have been inadequate risk management and analysis regarding the flight's approach and landing phase (3.28, 3.51).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Weather was not a contributing factor as "the weather was suitable for the flight" (4.1), and there is no indication that weather conditions directly influenced the pilot's decision-making process leading to the accident.
- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fatigue being a factor in the accident, and there is insufficient information to suggest that fatigue management played a role.

    '
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The pilot had completed training and was familiar with the equipment, having flown "32 hours on the EC120-B" (3.36), so this theme does not appear to be a contributing factor to the accident.
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no indication in the document that regulatory oversight and compliance were issues in this accident.

    '
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The accident was not related to emergency response preparedness, as the issue was the loss of control before impact, not the response after the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There were "no mechanical issues identified that may have contributed to the loss of control" (4.8 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), indicating that maintenance and inspection were not factors in the accident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not suggest that automation played a role in the accident, as the loss of control was due to pilot actions and not automated systems.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence of communication breakdown contributing to the accident, as the issue was related to the pilot''s control of the helicopter.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the accident outside of those already listed.
