Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of situational awareness: The crew member's reduced situational awareness of their own safety led to them stepping too close to the mooring winch and getting trapped between the rope and the winch drum.

2. Operational limitation of the mooring winch: The mooring winch had not been operated as recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and this increased the risk of injury to the crew operating the winch. The presence of transverse bars on the winch reduced the clearance and increased the risk of the rope getting stuck.

3. Inadequate risk assessment for unmooring operations: The risk assessment for mooring and unmooring operations on board the vessel did not comply with the company's safety management system. There was a lack of sufficient personnel, blind spots on the mooring deck, and a lack of training and experience that were not properly mitigated.

4. Lack of proper communication and coordination: The crew did not conduct a proper toolbox meeting to discuss hazards and mitigation strategies before commencing the unmooring operation. This led to a lack of communication between the winch operator and the crew handling the ropes, increasing the risk of accidents.

5. Inadequate implementation and auditing of the safety management system: The safe job analysis for mooring operations deviated from the intent of the safety management system, indicating that there were control measures lacking or insufficiently mitigating the identified risks. This suggests a need for improvement in internal and external audits of the safety management system.

6. Insufficient planning and coordination of unmooring operations: The forward mooring team did not sufficiently plan the unmooring operations to mitigate the risk of crew members operating in blind spots. A proper toolbox meeting may have identified the need for changes in the unmooring plan to address the reduction in crewing available on the forward mooring deck.
