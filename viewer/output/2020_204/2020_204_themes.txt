Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of situational awareness: The crew member's reduced situational awareness of their own safety led to them stepping too close to the mooring winch and getting trapped between the rope and the winch drum.

2. Operational limitation of the mooring winch: The mooring winch had not been operated as recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and this increased the risk of injury to the crew operating the winch. The presence of transverse bars on the winch reduced the clearance and increased the risk of the rope getting stuck.

3. Inadequate risk assessment for unmooring operations: The risk assessment for mooring and unmooring operations on board the vessel did not comply with the company's safety management system. There were blind spots on the mooring deck, lack of sufficient personnel, and a lack of proper toolbox meetings to address hazards and mitigate risks.

4. Lack of supervision and communication: The responsible person in charge of the forward mooring team was also the winch operator, which compromised their ability to supervise the team members and communicate effectively. This increased the risk of accidents.

5. Inadequate implementation and auditing of the safety management system: The safe job analysis for mooring operations deviated from the intent of the safety management system, indicating that there were control measures lacking or insufficiently mitigating the identified risks. This suggests a need for improvement in internal and external audits of the safety management system.

6. Lack of training and experience: The crew member involved in the accident had limited experience and had only recently started working as an OS. The mitigation measures for lack of training and experience were not effectively implemented.
