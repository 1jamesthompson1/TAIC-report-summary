The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission  may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 26 November 2016 the commercial passenger fishing charter vessel Francie  was 
operating a charter out of Kaipara Harbour with the skipper and 10 passengers on board.  
1.2. The skipper decided to cross the Kaipara Harbour b ar and fish in an a rea of deeper water off 
the coast.   By the time the Francie  attempted to re -enter Kaipara Harbour, a forecast 
developing swell and the influence of an ebbing tide had caused the waves over the Kaipara  
Harbour  bar to increase in height, steepen and break  from several directions.  
1.3. The Francie  was struck from behind by a large breaking wave, then capsized and sank.  Eight 
of the 11 people on board died.  Only three people were  wearing lifejacket s when the Francie  
capsized.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that the conditions on 
the Kaipara Harbour bar when the Francie  attempted to return were predictably unsuitable 
for the Francie  to cross, and indications were that the skipper had a propensity for crossing 
the Kaipara  Harbour  bar in adverse conditions.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that it is virtually certain that everyone on board would have had 
a better chance of survival if they had been wearing a lifejacket, and virtually certain that 
more people would have survived had those lifejackets been fitted with crotch straps.  The 
Commission noted  that people  have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing 
lifejacket s that are well fitted and of type s appropriate to the location s and conditions where 
they will be used . 
1.6. The Commission identified three key safety issues:  
 Some people are using the accident and incident reporting process to raise safety 
concerns because there is currently no dedicated , formal process within Maritime New 
Zealand where members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports 
on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected 
breaches of maritime legislation  
 maritime rules that sp ecify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels 
are based only on how far the vessel s are permitted to travel from the coast.  The rules 
do not  consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours 
and on exposed co astlines, where higher -specification lifejacket s would be more 
appropriate  
 there are indications that  people may not have a sufficient understanding of the design 
and capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or of the importance of 
wearing a lifejacket  of the correct size and type for  any situation where there is a risk of 
people ending up in the water.  
1.7. The Commission made four recommendations to Maritime New Zealand to address these 
issues and noted the actions already being taken to addres s one of the safety issues.  
1.8. Key lessons  arising from this inquiry were : 
 extreme caution must be exercised when crossing bars because sea conditions can 
change for the worse in a very short time.  Waves can come from more than one 
direction and are usually larger  and steeper than surrounding waters and often 
breaking  
 wearing a lifejacket will significantly improve the chances of survival if a person  
unexpectedly find s themselves in the water  
 when a person  wearing a lifejacket unexpectedly find s themselves in  the water, their 
chances of surviving are significantly improved if the lifejacket is of the appropriate type 
for the conditions and size of the person, and is fitted with a crotch strap to prevent 
their losing it when it rides up and over their head  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206  the Maritime New Zealand website has useful information  about selecting a proper 
lifejacket that best suits a person's  maritime activity, and how and when it should be 
worn  
 if a person  has concerns about the safety of any maritime activity, they should not 
hesitate to report them  to the appropriate maritime regulator.  This could help prevent 
accidents and save lives in.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. At 1609 on 26 November 2016, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) received notification  from Maritime New Zealand  that a 12 -metre (m) fishing 
vessel with 11  persons on board  had capsized and foundered crossing the Kaipara  Harbour  
bar2. 
2.2. The same day the Commission opened a n inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation  Commission  Act 1990 , and appointed an investigator  in charge.  
2.3. On 27 November two investigators travelled to Auckland for site investigation.  
2.4. On 29 November another two investigators join ed the investigation team on  site. The site 
investigation team return ed to Wellington on Friday 2 December.  
2.5. On 15 December two investigators travelled to Auckland to conduct an interview and attend 
a multi -agency debrief  into the incident response.  
2.6. On 17 October 2017 two investigators travelled to Auckland to conduct an interview . 
2.7. On 21 March 2018 the Commission approved the draft report for circulation to four 
interest ed persons . 
2.8. A submission was received from one of the interest ed person s and any changes as a result 
of that submission have been included in this final re port. 
2.9. On 23 May 2018  the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The Francie  was owned and operated by the skipper on the day of the accident.  The skipper 
did not survive the accident.  The following sequence of events and observations are based 
on interviews with the three surviving passengers , records  of the Royal New Zealand 
Coastguard  (Coastguard), and information from other sources as appropriate . 
3.1.2.  This report frequently refers to personal floatation devices and buoyancy aids, and the 
various types and their use.  There are many terms used to describe the various devices, and 
they are often referred to generically as 'lifejackets'.  For clarity, unless stated otherwise, the 
term 'lifejacket ' is used to describe all those safety devices that might otherwise be referred 
to as personal floatation devices or buoyancy aids.  
3.1.3.  The two types of lifejacket most relevant to this report are the type 401 and type 402 
lifejackets.   Table 1 gives a description of each type and its use.  The type 401 inflatable 
lifejacket and the type 402 lifejacket are shown with crotch straps, which are desig ned to 
prevent the lifejacket s riding up and in extreme cases slipping over the head s of the wearer s.  
A description is also given for the type 403 personal flo atation device . 
Name and type of lifejacket  Example  
Open waters type 401 - inflatable  
 Achieves buoyancy by  either  a: 
o water -activated switch , or a  
o manual pull cord  
 May include a mouthpiece  
 Designed to keep the wearer vertical during 
unconsciousness  
 Comfortable and convenient to wear at all times  
Must provide 150 newtons3 of buoyancy   
Open waters type 401 - semi -rigid 
 Achieves buoyancy by a semi -rigid foam  
 Designed to keep the wearer vertical during 
unconsciousness  
 Minimum buoyancy rating of 100 newtons (adult size)  
 Not suitable for continuous wearing on pleasure craft  
Best suited for emergencies  
 
                                                        
3 A newton is a unit of force, in this case used to describe the magnitude of buoyancy provided by a 
lifejacket . 

 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 5 >>
 Inshore waters type 402 
 Must have a buoyant collar  
 Not designed to keep an unconscious person's face 
above water  
 Provides at least 71 newtons of buoyancy (adult size)  
 Comfortable and convenient to wear at all times  
 Compatible with a crotch strap  
 Not suitable for rough conditions   
Specialist lifejackets and personal flo atation devices type 403 
 No collar  
 Lower buoyancy rating when compared to other 
lifejackets  
 Lower levels of support and safety compared to other 
models  
 No reflective or bright material s 
 Necessary for some aquatic sports  
Must have at least 53 newtons of buoyancy (adult size)

Description of lifejacket types  
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  At approximately  0600 on the morning of 26 November 2016 , the Francie  departed its berth 
in Helensville  en route to  Parakai wharf  (see Figure 1). At about 0630 the Francie , crewed 
solely by the skipper , arrived at Parakai wharf , where 10 passengers boarded.   
3.2.2.  The skipper  welcomed the passengers aboard and showed them where the lifejacket s and 
toilet were.  Three  of the passengers had brought their  own lifejacket s, which they were 
wearing as the Francie  departed the berth.  T he skipper  and the remaining seven 
passengers we re not wearing lifejackets . 
3.2.3.  At about 0645 the skipper  used VHF ( very high frequency ) radio to make a trip report to the 
Royal New Zealand Coastguar d (Coastguard) , reporting the number of people on board and 
that the destination was Kaipara Harbo ur.  Shortly before 0700 the Francie  departed 
Parakai wharf  bound for K aipara Harbour  with 11 people on board . 
3.2.4.  Kaipara Harbour is a 'bar harbour', which means that across its entrance it has a large and , 
in this case , complex arrangement of sand bars with chann els of deeper water.  The 
skipper's preferred fishing area was in the deeper water outside4 the bar.   
3.2.5.  Reach ing the skipper's  preferred fishing ground on the 'outside' of the harbour required the 
Francie  to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar.  The decision to cross the bar was dependent on 
environmental conditions , and the skipper  would not have made  it until he had observed the 
conditions on the bar as he approached the entrance to what was locally known as the 
'South Channel '. If the skipper  had decided against crossing the bar , the intention would 
have been  to fish in an area known locally as 'The Graveyard ' and other fishing grounds 
within Kaipara Harbour  (see Figure 1).

<< Page 6 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206 3.2.6.  At about 0920, a s the Francie  approached the entrance to the South Chann el, the state of 
the tide  was about one hour after high water .  The skipper  considered the sea conditions at 
the bar  acceptable  and made the decision to cross  and head  out toward s the favoured 
fishing grounds.   
3.2.7.  At about 0931 the skipper  used the VHF radio to request a bar watch5 from Coastguard 
Radio while he transited the Kaipara Harbour bar.  
3.2.8.  Witnesses described the sea conditions crossing the bar as calm .  At about 0957, o nce 
safely clear of the bar , the skipper  instructed  Coastguard using VHF radio to close the bar 
watch .   
3.2.9.  The Francie  continued motoring in a westerly direction for about 45 minutes until it reached 
the 50  m contour line6,  where it stopped and the passengers  began fishing . The sea 
conditions during this period were described as calm.  
3.2.10.  After 45 minutes ' fishing the passenger s had caught their  quota and the fishing gear was 
recovered i n preparation for returning to Kaipara  Harbour  to continue fishing for other 
species . 
3.2.11.  The skipper  steered  the Francie  towards the inbound entrance of the South Channel leading 
across the Kaipara Harbour bar. As the Francie  neared the bar the wave  and swell  height 
increased significantly ; survivors describ ed the waves as "monsters ".  The skipper  had 
difficulty  controlling the direction and speed of the vessel, and the Francie  was pushed to 
the south of the channel entrance  (see Figure 1).   
3.2.12.  After about one hour the skipper  abandoned his attempt to reach the South C hannel  
because he had missed the entrance  to th e channel . He turned  the Francie  around and 
headed back out to sea. About 45 minutes later , after reach ing calmer water again , the 
skipper  turned the Francie  around and began a second attempt at crossing the bar  by using 
the same South Channel .  
3.2.13.  As the Francie  approached the bar a  passenger suggested to the skipper that he call 
Coastguard  and request a bar watch.  At about 1402 the skipper used VHF radio to request 
a 60 -minute bar watch for the Kaipara Harbour bar - South Channel.  Coastguard replied but  
recommended a 30 -minute check call , to which the skipper agreed.  As he stowed the VHF 
radio microphone , a breaking wave struck  the Francie  from the port quarter7, rolling the 
vessel heavily to starboard8 and causing it to capsize.   
3.2.14.  At the time of the ca psize there were three or four people, including the skipper, in the 
wheelhouse ; the remainder of the passengers were outside on the aft9 deck.   
3.2.15.  By about 1503 Coastguard had not been able to make contact with the Francie to close the 
bar watch, so it init iated a full search and rescue operation.  
3.2.16.  Of those who were on the aft deck, one was wearing his own type 403 personal floatation 
device, but he was seen to be struggling to remain afloat and eventually sank.  His body was 
recovered later.  A type 403 personal floatation device later recovered from the beach was 
highly likely his.
                                                        
5 A monitoring service offered by Coastguard. A vessel's crew informs Coastguard that the vessel is about to 
cross the bar and Coastguard logs their intention. The two parties agree to a time period for the vessel to 
cross the bar. If, within that time period, the crew has not informed Coastguard that the vessel has safely 
crossed the bar, Coastguard begins its follow -up process, potentially leading to search and rescue 
procedures.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 3.2.17.  One of the three on deck who survived was wearing a lifejacket supplemented with flotsam10 
to help remain afloat.  A second  survivor used only flotsam to remain afloat while they waited 
to be rescued.  They were both found at about 1603, and airlifted to safety by about 1616.  
3.2.18.  The third survivor  was in the wheelhouse  at the time of the capsize.  He managed  to escape  
and when  he came to the surface he found two of the Francie 's lifejacket s floating nearby , 
which he used to help  keep  him afloat.  He found that the lifejacket s were too small for him 
to wear , so he placed an arm through each neck  hole and used a piece of timber  found 
floating nearby  for additional buoyancy before swimming  toward s the beach.  He was found 
by rescuers at about 1740 as he made his way to dry land . 
3.2.19.  The bodies of the eight  deceased were recovered by emergency services over the following 
nine days.   One of those was  the third person known to have been wearing a lifejacket.  He 
was wearing an inflatable type 401 lifejacket that was not fitted with a crotch strap.  The 
lifejacket was later found separate ly from his body, uninflated.  
3.3. The Francie   
3.3.1.  The Francie  was an 11.9  m charter fishing vessel constructed in steel and built in New 
Zealand. It had been  launched and commenced operating on the Hauraki Gulf in 2003 .  In 
2010 the vessel had been  purchased and transported to Kaipara Harbour  where it 
continue d operating as a chart er fishing vessel.  
3.3.2.  The skipper owned two companies : Francie  Charters  Limited , which had purchased the 
Francie  in early 2014  and was a fully owned trading subsidiary of Kaipara Marine 
Engineering Limited, the other  business owned solely by the skipper .  Francie Charters was 
based in an d operated out of Helensville . 
3.3.3.  The Francie  had under gone  a survey11  comprising  an in -water inspection in June 2015 , 
followed by an out -of-water inspection in July.  The survey  had been  completed in early 
August .  A certificate of survey  (Fit for Purpose  Certificate ) had been  issued on 17 August 
2015  and imposed four conditions:  
 vessel to be operated in accordance with any plan approval conditions  
 vessel to be operated with all due care and attention to wind, waves, and weather 
conditions  
 vessel to be operated over west coast bars in favourable conditions only  
 when operating within west coast limits, this vessel must be operated with a clear 
weather window for the expected time of the voyage . 
3.3.4.  The Fit for Purpose Certificate also stated  that:  
 [lifejacket s] are to be worn when crossing bars in adverse conditions or any time at 
the instruction of the skipper . 
3.3.5.  The Francie  was cate gorised as a passenger vessel for tourist and charter fishing activities .  
The m aximum number  of passengers was 20 and the minimum number of crew was one .  
3.3.6.  The Francie  was certified to operate  within restricted limits (inshore).  This meant  that the 
Francie 's operating area included Kaipara Harbour and from 12 nautical miles (nm)  north of 
Hokianga  Harbour heads to 12 nm south of Raglan Harbour heads  within 12 nm of the shore  
(see Figure 2).

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 3.3.7.  Figure 1 shows an excerpt of the Kaipara Harbour chart , with various features pertinent to 
the Francie 's operation.  Kaipara Harbour  is a large estuary, and the bar at its entrance is 
the largest in New Zealand. The bar is 2-3 nm wide and extends approximately 12  nm across 
the entrance  of Kaipara Harbour  to approximately  4 nm offshore.  
3.3.8.  The chart shows two channels at the northern end of the bar : the Northern Channel and the 
Southern Channel. The Northern Channel is rarely used  as it runs predominantly parallel to 
the swell and can be difficult to navigate . The Southern Channel is more regularly used but is 
also vulnerable to inclement sea conditions.  
3.3.9.  Another channel cross es the bar farther to the south ; it is known locally as the 'South 
Channel ' or the 'Dog-leg'. It is not marked on the chart because its location is prone to 
move ment  over time. It is reported to be c almer  and easier to use  than the other channels , 
and was  the preferred channel for several skippers , including the Francie 's.  
3.4. The Francie 's Marine Transport Operator Plan  
3.4.1.  Maritime Rules Part 19 Maritime Transport Operator - Certification and Responsibilities 
require s maritime transport operators to develop  and operate in accordance with safety 
systems that are specific and appropriate to their mariti me transport operation s. The rule  
also govern s the  Maritime Operator Safety System (MOSS ), which  is regulated by M aritime 
New Zealand . 
3.4.2.  To enter MOSS, an operator must develop a Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP) and 
submit it for a desktop review and site visit by Maritime New Zealand .  When Maritime New 
Zealand  is satisfied  that the MTOP complies with Rule s Part 19, it issue s a Maritime 
Transport Operator Certificate to the operator.  The Maritime Rules require that the MTOP  
include provision s to: 
 identif y and manage the safety risks involved in the maritime transport operation  
 address all reasonably foreseeable hazards associated with the  operation.  
3.4.3.  The Francie 's MTOP included a vessel manual that provided  details about operating the 
Francie , inclu ding equipment lists, safe operating procedures, emergency procedures, the 
hazard register, and a section covering records and plans.   The MTOP  identified that a 
significant risk for the operation was crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar and fishing on the 
ocean side .   
3.4.4.  The relevant extracts from the MTOP 's safe operating procedures  in respect of  the Francie 's 
operation are provided  below.  
The safe operating procedures pr escribed general operational limits with respect to weather 
and sea conditions :  
 no trip to  proceed when wind speed is predicted  to be above 30 knots  
 no trip will proceed where there is forecast greater than a 3-metre swell or greater 
than a 2 -metre swell with a 1 -metre cross chop.  This will be further modified for 
when there is wind against ti de/current and any degree of breaking water  
 fishing in areas where there are conditions of onshore wind and onshore swell is to 
be avoided where practicable . 
3.4.5.  The safe operating procedures also included a section on 'bar crossing '. The section 
reflect ed good practices described in the National Code of Practice for Bar Crossings (see 
Appendix 1). The opening paragraph s of that section are  taken verbatim from the code: 
Extreme caution must be exercised when crossing bars. Conditions prevailing on a 
bar or i n river approaches may cause unusually sudden steep and often breaking 
seas. Conditions change quickly and unpredictably. The skipper 's experience and 
the vessel type should be taken into account when a bar crossing is considered. 
However, no amount of exp erience or boat type makes crossing a bar SAFE when 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 11 >>
 the conditions are marginal or adverse. No situation warrants taking the risk, so if in 
doubt "STAY OUT" . 
The second paragraph states:  
Before leaving harbour the skipper must assess conditions on the bar.  The skipper 
must be aware that a rapid change in conditions might prevent a safe return to 
harbour and if in doubt, should not leave port. Adequate reserve fuel must be 
available to enable the vessel to divert to another port or safe haven should adverse 
bar conditions prevail on their return.  
3.4.6.  The M TOP also states that skippers should be aware that:  
 all bars have areas of broken water containing air, which can severely reduce the 
stability and handling of a vessel  
 vessels attempting to cross a bar at or ne ar low water are more likely to experience 
adverse conditions than at high water . 
3.4.7.  The bar crossing section of the MTOP provides  a list of prompts for skipper s to address  
before crossing a bar: 
 check the weather, tide and bar conditions  
 contact Coastguard or maritime radio immediately prior to crossing  
 ensure adequate stability  
 batten down12 
 make sure lifejackets are worn and everyone on board is alert  
 approach at moderate speed  
 post a lookout to monitor sea conditions astern  
 avoid ebb tide13 
 if in doubt - don't cross  
 communicate your successful crossing to Coastguard or Maritime Radio.  
3.4.8.  Additionally , with respect to  lifejacket s, the vessel 's standing orders stated : 
 all passengers and crew must wear lifejackets at all times, unless expressly given 
permission by  the skipper.  
3.5. The owner  and skipper  
3.5.1.  The skipper had worked in various roles throughout his career , including as relief crew on 
sand extraction barges on Kaipara Harbour . 
3.5.2.  He was also the sole owner of Kaipara Marine Engineering , based in Helensville, which 
owned the Francie  and also provided repair and maintenance services for other recreational 
and commercial vessels.  
3.5.3.  When the owner  purchased the Francie  he had not  held an appropriate skipper 's 
qualification , so he  had employed  a licensed skipper . The owner had begun  using the 
Francie  for charter fishing operations in early 2014. Th e licensed skipper  had subsequently  
resigned , after which  the owner had begun  acting as skipper.   
3.5.4.  On 15 September 2014 Maritime New Zealand  had become aware that the owne r was not 
qualified to be skipper of the Francie .  Maritime New Zealand  had issued a notice of 
                                                        
12 Close and secure all openings through which water could enter the vessel.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 imposition against the vessel that the Francie  could not be operated commercially unless 
the person acting as skipper was qualified to do so. 
3.5.5.  The owner had employed another appropriately qualified person to act as skipper for charter 
fishing trips until he obtained his Skipper Restricted Limits qualification in November 2014, 
following which he had resumed responsibilities as skipper of the Francie .  Skipper 
Restricted Limits is a command certificate that allows a person to perform skipper duties on 
passenger and non -passenger ships of less than 12 m length overall  (the Francie  was 11.9 
m long) . 
3.5.6.  The skipper died in the accident and hi s body w as recovered.  The p ost-mortem examination 
revealed that he had died by drowning.  Post -mortem toxicology was carried out, which 
showed he was free from any performance -impairing substances.  
3.6. Environmental  conditions  
3.6.1.  MetService is New Zealand 's national wea ther authority ; it provides a weather information 
service. The MetService weather forecast for 26 November 2016 was:  
Issued: 26 -NOV-2016 04:39 [two hours before the Francie  left the wharf ] 
Valid to: 26 -NOV-2016 23:59  
KAIPARA 6  
Northwest 15 knots rising to 25 knots this evening. Sea becoming rough. 
Southwest swell rising to 3 metres. Northwest swell 2 metres easing. Fair 
visibility in showers this afternoon and evening.  
OUTLOOK FOLLOWING 3 DAYS: Westerly 25 knots with rough sea,  easing 
Monday southwest 15 knots. Southwest swell becoming heavy Sunday, easing 
Monday.  
3.6.2.  Coastguard broadcasts real -time marine weather information and forecasts. Its forecast s are 
updated and broadcast every 20  minutes  via VH F radio and the Coastguard  mobile phone 
app. On aggregate the forecast for 26 November gave  an average wind speed of 10-25 
knots with wind gusts of 15-35 knots , and for a southwest  swell to rise to 3 m throughout the 
day. 
3.6.3.  The Coastguard crew attending the rescue reported that the wave height on the bar was 
between  4 m and  8 m on the afternoon of the accident.  
3.6.4.  For 26 November the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research 's Tide 
Forecaster14 predicted the time of high water for the Kaipara Harbour bar at 0826 , and a 
height of 2.76  m above 'lowest possible tide'.  The time of l ow water was predicted for 1432 , 
with a height of 0.85m above lowest possible tide.  
3.6.5.  The Francie  entered the South Channel outbound at about 0930 , and was clear of the bar at 
about 1000 , having crossed the bar on the ebb tide close to one  hour after high water .  
3.6.6.  At about 1200  the Francie  began its first inbound attempt to reach the South Channel and 
cross the bar  on an ebb tide about 2.5 hours before low water. The  second attempt was 
made  at about 1400 , 30 minutes before low water .  
3.7. Lifejacket s  
3.7.1.  It was not possible to establish exactly how many lifejackets were carried on the day of the 
accident.  However, t he Francie  was required to carry at least 22 lifejackets of the 71-
newton type 402 , and at least three 40-newton  child -sized lifejacket s.

Zealand . 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 13 >>
 3.7.2.  The Maritime Rules required that the lifejackets comply with New Zealand Standard  (NZS)  
5823  (amended in 1989, 2001  and 2005 ).  NZS 5823 defines the specifications for 
lifejackets and marine safety harnesses.   
3.7.3.  NZS 5823 required that lifejackets carry  appropriate warnings. The warning required by NZS 
5823 for type 402 lifejacket s was:  
 when worn, this PFD [personal floatation device] will improve a wearer's chances 
of survival, but its use does not gu arantee [the]  safety and ultimate rescue of the 
wearer, but will afford support in the water for an extended period  
 the use of this PFD may not hold your head above water if unconscious  
 the effectiveness of your PFD is greatly increased if a crotch strap i s fitted to 
prevent it riding up over your head  
 the effectiveness of a personal flo atation device is considerably reduced in rough 
water, breaking seas, and surf.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Crossing a sand bar is a high -risk activity , so much so that Maritime New Zealand has 
produced a National Code for Bar Crossing s (see Appendix 1).  Crossing a bar is dangerous 
because  the sea conditions can change quickly and unpredictably , resulting in  unusually  
large and  steep, and often confused , breaking waves . 
4.1.2.  Sand bars  form  at the entrance to a harbour when  debris from the inner harbour and its 
tributaries is carried out by fast -flowing currents and tides to be deposited near the harbour 
entrance.  Just like on a beach, o cean waves increase in height and steepness as th ey move 
into shallower water over the  sand bar . 
4.1.3.  There is often a complex system of deeper channels carved out through a sand bar by the 
significant tidal flow s into and out of the harbour.  These  tidal flow s can further amplify the 
already rising steep wav es and even confuse the ir direction .  This effect is accentuated when 
the tidal flow is acting in the opposite direction to the ocean waves and wind, especially 
around low tide when the depth of water over the bar is less  than at any other time . 
4.1.4.  The follow ing analysis discusses what happened to the Francie  and how it came to be 
outside the Kaipara Harbour bar in adverse conditions.  
4.1.5.  The analysis  also discusses  three  safety issues : 
 some people are using the accident and incident reporting process to raise safety 
concerns because there is currently no dedicated , formal process within Maritime New 
Zealand where members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports 
on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected 
breaches of maritime legislation  
 maritime rules that specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels are 
based only on how far the vessel s are permitted to travel fr om the coast.  The rules do 
not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on 
exposed coastlines, where higher -specification lifejacket s would be more appropriate  
 there are indications that  people may not have a suffic ient understanding of the design 
and capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or of the importance of wearing 
a lifejacket  of the correct size and type for  any situation where there is a risk of people 
ending up in the water.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The skipper's preferred fishing ground was in the deeper water seaward of the Kaipara 
Harbour bar, which meant leaving the shelter of the harbour and crossing the bar, and 
having to cross the bar again to re -enter the harbour.  When  the Francie  reached the  
entrance to the South Channel the sea conditions over the bar were reasonably calm .  
However,  it was close to high tide and the tide had only just begun to ebb .  Based on what he 
observed , the skipper decided to cross the bar.  
4.2.2.  By the time  the Francie  appr oached the bar on the return journey , the predicted southwest 
swell had likely increased and was interacting with the already present low northwest swell.  
The tide was much lower , meaning the depth of water over the bar had decreased .  A 
predicted increas e in wind speed from the northwest may also have contributed to the state 
of the sea over the bar . 
4.2.3.  Eye witnesses and Coastguard  crew who took part in the search and rescue operation 
estimated  that the wave heights were between 4 m and 8 m. 
4.2.4.  Having decided t o make a second attempt to cross the bar, the skipper was no more 
prepared than he had been  for the first attempt.  From interviews with the survivors, it 
appears likely that o nly three of the 11 people on board were wearing lifejackets .  It was 
reported that the skipper  only register ed a bar watch with Coastguard  when prompted by one 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 15 >>
 of the passengers.  The National Code of Practice for Bar Crossing s refers to the importance 
of posting a watch behind to warn the helmsman of dangerous waves.   The skipper was 
reportedly distracted with registering the bar watch when the Francie  was struck from behind 
by the large breaking wave  that caused the vessel to capsize.  
4.3. Decision to cross the Kaipara  Harbour  bar 
4.3.1.  The wave conditions that developed over t he Kaipara  Harbour  bar while the Francie  fished in 
deeper water were entirely predictable given the forecast conditions and the change in the 
tide. 
4.3.2.  The MetService forecast was for n orthwest wind 15 knots rising to 25 knots in the evening, 
with the sea beco ming rough.  A southwest swell  was predicted to develop and rise to 3 m. 
The prevailing 2 m northwest swell was predicted to ease .  Conditions were predicted to 
worsen in the following  few days . 
4.3.3.  The skipper was known to check weather forecasts routinely and had cancelled charter 
fishing trips due to adverse forecast s before.  It could not be established whether he had 
obtained the weather forecast on this occasion, but it is about as likely as not that he had.  
4.3.4.  The Francie 's MTOP acknowledge d that "Extreme caution must be exercised when crossing 
bars" and that "Before leaving harbour the skipper must assess conditions on the bar [and] 
be aware that a rapid change in conditions might prevent a safe return to harbour and if in 
doubt, should not leave port ". 
4.3.5.  The MTOP also stated:  
 … no trip [across the bar] will proceed where the wind speed is predicted (taking 
into account meteorological surface pressure maps) to be above 30 knots  
 … no trip will proceed where there is forecast greater than a 3 metre swell or 
greater than a 2 -metre swell with a one-metre cross chop.  This will be further 
modified for when there is wind against tide/current and any degree of breaking 
water.  
4.3.6.  The National Code of Practice for Bar Crossing s gives some learned  advice that "no amount  
of experience or boat type makes crossing a bar SAFE when the conditions are marginal or 
adverse. No situation warrants taking the risk, so if in doubt 'STAY OUT '", and " adequate 
reserve fuel must be available to enable the vessel to divert to another por t or safe haven 
should adverse bar conditions prevail on their return ".  This advice was included in the 
Francie 's MTOP.  
4.3.7.  There was feasibly  no viable alternative for the Francie  to enter a safe harbour.  There were 
other harbours to the south and north, bu t these would have taken some time to reach and 
they too were both bar harbours , likely with wave conditions  similar  to those encountered 
over the Kaipara Harbour bar. 
4.3.8.  The Francie  was set up for day charters only, so the option of staying outside the bar 
overnight , with 10 passengers on board  and with inclement weather forecast , would have 
been  a difficult decision for the skipper to make.  
4.3.9.  His decision to persevere with a second attempt at enter ing over the bar, in  spite of the 
difficulties encountered wit h the first attempt , was possibly a result of this lack of 
alternatives .   
4.3.10.  This accident highlights the importance of fully understanding the risks involved with 
crossing harbour bars and the various factors that can make them so unpredictable and 
subject to rapidly changing sea conditions.  For an operation such as the Francie  fishing 
charters, a trip begins and ends i nside Kaipara Harbour.  Because of the limited options 
once out over the bar, t he biggest risk is more about what factors are going to affec t the 
ability to get back in.  

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206 4.3.11.  In this case, indications are that the skipper was deceived by the relatively benign conditions 
for the outbound bar crossing and either did not consider that they would likely change for 
the inward journey or did not fully ap preciate the risks involved.  This latter point is discussed 
in the following section.  
Finding s 
1. The forecast weather conditions , in combination with the state of the tide , were 
not suitable for the Francie  to head out over the Kaipara  Harbour  bar and make a 
safe return . 
2. The Francie  capsized when it was struck by a large breaking wave from behind 
while the skipper was distracted by making a radio call.  
 
4.4. Risk 
4.4.1.  When the skipper first purchased the Francie  he had engaged a surveyor to inspect the 
vessel  and issue a Fit for Purpose Certificate. The surveyor confirmed that the skipper had 
conducted all of the work on the vessel that he had advised,  and that he had been  careful to 
do as the surveyor requested with respect to systems and equipment.  Engineering systems  
were the skipper 's area of expertise.  
4.4.2.  Regarding marine operations, the skipper demonstrated repeated non -compliance with the 
Maritime Rules .  One reason for this could have been his  low experience.  Another reason 
could have been  his having a too high acceptance of risk.   
4.4.3.  The Commission compared the Francie 's MTOP to those of other charter fishing vessels and 
found  that its written procedures around operational limits and bar crossing s were 
exemplary. The skipper himself had researched and written the MTOP, and it reflected the 
best practi ce described by aforementioned authorities on bar crossing s.  On paper he 
demonstrated an understanding of the dangers of bar crossing.  
4.4.4.  But t he skipper's decision to cross the bar in the forecast weathe r conditions is an indication 
that either  he did not understand the risk he was taking or that the risk had become 
normalised over time and therefore not considered to be high .  Other people who had 
previously sailed on the Francie described the skipper as  being 'comfortable' crossing the 
bar in adverse conditions . 
4.4.5.  The person who had first skippered  the Francie  had been  hired by the owner to operate the 
Francie  and provide some training for when the owner obtained his own skipper's certificate.  
After about one month the employed skipper  had resigned  because the Francie 's owner 
would reportedly not listen to his advice or take instruction.  
4.4.6.  The comments made by the two other skippers  are supported by other data.  The 
Commission obtained all of the trip and bar reports made to Coastguard  for the previous two 
years and obtained historical weather forecast data for the same period.   An analysis of this 
data revealed that the Francie  had often crossed the Kaipara Harbour bar in forecast poor 
weather cond itions, when other commercial operators remained fishing within Kaipara 
Harbour.  
4.4.7.  When compared to all other operators, the Francie 's stood out as one of two operators who 
routinely crossed the Kaipara  Harbour  bar in adverse weather conditions.  
4.4.8.  After his skipper had resign ed, the Francie 's owner had acted as skipper  even though  he did 
not possess  the required qualification.   It is highly likely that the owner had been  aware that 
he was not complying with the M aritime Rules in doing so.  
4.4.9.  An identified compla inant  had notified Maritime New Zealand  that the owner was acting as 
skipper without the required qualification.  Maritime New Zealand  subsequently conducted 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 17 >>
 an inspection of the Francie  and found  that the unqualified owner had acted  as skipper.  It 
issued a Notice of Imposition of Condit ions against the vessel , which stated that the Francie  
was "not to be op erated commercially unless the m aster is the holder of a  Skipper Restricted 
Limit s certificate ". 
4.4.10.  The process of bringing the vessel into survey had taken  around 18 months ; however , during 
that time the surveyor had come  to feel that the Francie 's owner did not a ppreciate the high 
level of risk involved in crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar.  As a result the surveyor  had 
imposed conditions on the vessel's Fit for Purpose Certificate in an attempt to en sure that 
the Francie  was operated safely:  
 vessel to be operated with all due care and attention to wind, waves, and weather 
conditions  
 vessel to be operated over west coast bars in favourable condit ions only  
 when operating within west coast limits, this vessel must be operated with a clear 
weather window for the expected time of the voyage . 
4.4.11.  The evidence suggests that the skipper had a tendency to not adhere strictly to the rules .  
This was also demon strated on the day  of the accident , when h e decided to cross the bar 
when the forecast weather conditions would  have prevented him doing so had he been 
complying strictly with the requirements of his Maritime Transport Operator Certificate and 
the associat ed MTOP, which he had written.  
4.5. Reporting safety related concerns  
Safety issue - Some people are using the accident and incident reporting pr ocess to raise 
safety concerns because  there is currently no dedicated , formal process within Maritime 
New Zealand where members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports 
on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected 
breaches of maritime legislation.  
4.5.1.  Anecdotal evidence re ceived by the Commission indicated  that some members of the 
maritime community recognised the danger posed by the skipper 's risk-taking behaviour.   
4.5.2.  Maritime New Zealand received four notifications regarding the Francie  from three people , 
which included operating without an appropriately qualified skipper.  Maritime New 
Zealand 's response was to intervene, audit the operation , and ensure  that the offence  was 
not repeated.  
4.5.3.  Although Maritime New Zealand does have  a formal accident and incident notification 
system, it is intended for use by operators  or vessel s' crew  for notifying Maritime New 
Zealand  of accident s and incident s involving vessel s.  
4.5.4.  The Civil Aviation Authority  has a dedicated process for anyone to report an aviation safety or 
security concern,  which  may include complaints or allegations of suspected breaches of civil 
aviation legislation.  The first point of contact with the regulator is a dedicated phone 
number and email address, and any issue raised automatically triggers a follow -up. 
4.5.5.  Maritim e New Zealand  does receive some information via its general enquiries contact point 
and also via its maritime officers ' engagement with the community .  However, there would 
be some added benefit if there were  a similar process to that operated by the C ivil Aviation 
Authority for people to report  safety and security concerns .   
4.5.6.  The Commission has made a recommendation to the Director of Maritime New Zealand that 
he consider providing and promoting a process for members of the public and the maritime 
comm unity to report safety and security concerns , including complaints and allegations of 
suspected breaches of maritime legislation.  

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206 Finding s 
3. Indications are that the skipper had a propensity to accept a high level of risk 
when deciding whether to cross the K aipara Harbour bar. 
4. The skipper  had a  propensity for crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar in high -risk 
conditions , which  was known to but not reported by others in the industry and 
community.  
5. A system is needed for people to make report s of safety -related concerns to 
Maritime New Zealand to provide the regulator with more opportunity to 
intervene before accidents happen.  
 
4.6. Survivability  
Lifejackets on board the Francie  
4.6.1.  Post-mortem examination s were  conducted of five of the recovered bodies.  The cause of 
death was not ascertained for one of them.  For the other four, drowning was identified as 
the very likely cause of death.  
4.6.2.  In a capsize situation, wearing a lifejacket is no guarantee of survival.  People trapped  inside 
a capsized vessel can sustain injuries that prevent their escape, regardless of whether 
lifejacket s are worn.  
4.6.3.  Of the 11 people aboard the Francie , it is very likely that only three of the passengers were 
wearing lifejackets  of some type , and these were their own personal lifejackets.  Two of the 
three passengers who were wearing their own lifejackets died.  One of the deceased had 
been wearing a type 401  inflatable lifejacket , but it was later recovered uninflat ed and 
separate from his body.  
4.6.4.  Another  was wearing a lifejacket15 but he was seen to struggle with staying afloat.  This 
lifejacket was also later recovered separate ly from his body.  This shows that wearing a 
lifejacket will not automatically guarantee survival for people who are thrown clear into the 
water.  There are other factors to be considered, such as the lifejacket being of the correct 
size and type for the situation , and properly fitted .  These factors are considered further 
below.  
4.6.5.  Neither of the lifejackets referred to above was fitted with a crotch strap.  A crotch strap can 
be attached to a l ifejacket to prevent the lifejacket riding up over the head of the survivor 
and potentially being lost. The crotch strap is attached at the back of the lifejacket and it 
passes between the wearer 's legs to attach at the front , as shown in Figure 3.

4.6.6.  In the case of the passenger wearing his own type 401 inflatable lifejacket, if that had been 
fitted with a crotch strap it very likely would have saved his life.  The other deceased 
passenger was wearing a personal flo atation device that was not specifically suitable for 
supporting a person in rough breaking waters.  This was the passenger seen by  survivors to 
be struggling to stay afloat in spite of his wearing such a device.  It is likely that he eventually 
slipped out of the personal flo atation device, which would not have happened had it been 
fitted with a crotch strap.  In his case his chances  of survival would have increased if a 
crotch strap had been fitted.  
4.6.7.  Although Maritime New Zealand  recommends the use of crotch straps , it does not require 
them to be fitted other than to children's lifejackets.  
4.6.8.  Notwithstanding the limitations of lifejacke ts, there is no doubt that wearing one will 
increase the chances of someone surviving in the water .  It is likely that more people would 
have survived this accident had everyone been wearing a suitable lifejacket .  This is a key 
lesson arising from this in quiry.  
4.6.9.  Maritime Rules 40A prescribes the type and number of lifejacket s that a commercial vessel 
such as the  Francie  should  carry, but does not prescribe when they should be worn.  The 
actual use of the lifejacket s is subject to the operator's  risk assessment process and 
resultant procedure s covered in their MTOP.  
4.6.10.  The Francie 's MTOP reflect ed the good practice of having all aboard  wear lifejackets when 
crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar. The section  on bar crossing required lifejackets to be  
worn, and the standing orders stated: "All passengers and crew must wear lifejackets at all 
times, unless expressly given permission by the skipper ". 
4.6.11.  However, according to survivors the skipper did not require everyone on board to wear a 
lifejacket when cross ing the bar.  He was not wearing one himself.  
4.6.12.  A survey of the other vessels operating fishing charters on Kaipara Harbour revealed that the 
practice of skippers not requiring people  to wear lifejackets was not un usual.   This issue is 
discussed further in t he following section.  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206 Use of suitable l ifejackets  
Safety issue - There are indications that people may not have a sufficient understanding of 
the design and capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or of the importance of 
wearing a lifejacket of the correct size and type for any situation where there is a risk of 
people ending up in the water.  
4.6.13.  There is a broader cultural issue underlying the failure of the people aboard the Francie  to 
wear lifejackets.  Survivors described a reluctan ce themselves to wear lifejackets and 
described this as their normal behaviour . 
4.6.14.  During an interview the survivor who described his friend struggling to stay afloat diminished 
the importance of lifejackets by saying , "He was wearing a lifejacket and he died  anyway ".   
4.6.15.  However, the deceased person was not wearing a 'lifejacket ' as described by NZS 5823 ; he 
was wearing a personal floatation device and there is a substantial difference in 
performance.  The survivor was unable to differentiate between t he variou s types of 
lifejacket.  T o him they were basically all the same.  
4.6.16.  Recognised recreational boating practices can be used as an indication of how the b roader  
public treats  the issue of wearing lifejacket s. The New Zealand Safer Boating Forum16 has 
identified that a failure to wear lifejacket s is overrepresented in fatalities .  
4.6.17.  Maritime New  Zealand  has recognised the failure to wear lifejacket s as a safety issue. It has  
conducted policy work for smaller craft, and a significant educational campaign t o increase 
the wearing  of lifejacket s.  Its program me also target s communities where the message 
about the importance of wearing lifejackets has not had  a good response.  
4.6.18.  'Lifejacket ' has a specific technical meaning, but it is widely used by the public as a generic 
term to describe any safety device worn by an individual to help them float when they are in 
the water. There are other generic terms such as 'personal floatation device ' and 'buoyancy 
aid' that tend to be used to describe the same thing.  
4.6.19.  Similarly, there are many types of lifejacket within  those generic terms. The primary 
differences are the ir size, the performance of the buoyancy they provide, and their intended 
use.  
4.6.20.  A Commission survey of the Kaipara Harbour fishing charter fleet showed  some lack of 
awareness of the types and names of lifejackets.  However, that lack of awareness is 
indicative of a broader misunderstanding of the  types and names of lifejackets in New 
Zealand.  This confusion was recognised as an issue in NZS 5823:2005 , which state d in its 
foreword:  
This revision was initiated in response to concerns being raised in the sector that 
existing lifejackets were not always accompanied by enough information to ensure 
the purchasers were able to select the most appropriat e devic e for their intended 
use. 
4.6.21.  In New Zealand, a primary source of information on lifejackets is Maritime New Zealand.  The 
Maritime New Zealand website contains a section titled 'Lifejackets' , which provides 
educational material on lifejackets, in cluding a sum mary of each type and an example image 
(see Appendix 2 for full details). The following is  a list of their names and types:  
 open waters type 401 - inflatable  
 open waters type 401 - semi -rigid 
 inshore waters type 402 (a semi -rigid was the type carried on the Francie ) 
                                                        
16 The New Zealand Safer Boating Forum was establishe d to co -ordinate and implement recreational 
boating safety initiatives. It is made up of government agencies, local government, water safety and 
recreational organisations, and the marine industry.  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 21 >>
  specialist lifejackets and personal floatation devices type 403 
 buoyancy aid and wetsuit type 404 
 buoyancy garment type 405 
 specialist personal floatation device  type 406 . 
4.6.22.  The webpage also includes a video that gives a comprehensive overview of lifejackets , 
including the types and their uses . It also encourages users to understand the differences 
and choose their lifejacket s carefully.  
4.6.23.  Some of the differences between the types of lifejacket are subtle, but some describe  critical 
differences in performance.   In particular, a type 401 lifejacket  (as initially worn by one of the 
deceased)  has significantly more buoyancy than other types and will maintain an 
unconscious person's face above water.  NZS 5823:2005 makes a distinction between a 
type 401 lifejacket and all the other types for that reason.  
4.6.24.  Given t he circumstances of this accident, which indicate  that not even some commercial 
operators have got the message about lifejackets; the comments from the survivors of t his 
accident; and the general boating fatality statistics it is clear  that the general public and the 
boating community have some way to go before they fulfil their responsibility to their clients, 
families and friends to resolve this safety issue.  The in formation is there to be found and the 
message is clear from the maritime regulators.  Normally the Commission would mak e a 
recommendation to address such a safety issue, but the efforts of Maritime New Zealand 
and other boating forums arguably go far enou gh to address the issue in the long term.  
4.7. Vessel operating limits and required lifejacket s 
Safety issue  - Maritime rules that specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial 
vessels are based only on how far the vessel s are permitted to travel from the coast.  The 
rules do not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours 
and on exposed coastlines, where higher -specification lifejacket s would be more 
appropriate . 
4.7.1.  It is almost certain that the lifejackets required to be provided on board  the Francie  were not 
being worn  by anyone on board while  the Francie  cross ed the Kaipara  Harbour  bar.  
Notwithstanding this , the Commission considered whether the types of lifejacket provided on 
board were suita ble for the conditions on the Kaipara  Harbour  bar that day.  
4.7.2.  The Francie  had been  surveyed and approved to operate within restricted limits (inshore).  In 
practice this meant that the Francie 's operating area included Kaipara Harbour, outside the 
harbour up  to 12 nm from the shore, and to designated north and south limits  (shown in 
Figure 2).  The operating area included the Kaipara  Harbour  bar, therefore the Francie  was 
approved  to cross the bar as part of its normal operations.  
4.7.3.  The Maritime Rules require a restricted -limits vessel to carry  type 402 lifejacket s for its 
passengers and crew.  NZS 5823 classes type 402 lifejacket s as "in-shore waters personal 
floatation devices " and states  that lifejackets are "anticipated for use on inshore waters 
where early  rescue may be expected ".  The presence of Coastguard , with its  reporting and 
search and rescue systems , does increase the chance of early rescue, but only provided the 
reporting systems are used and a distress message is able to be made.  
4.7.4.  Also, this accide nt demonstrates how quickly people can succumb in rough breaking seas 
over a sand bar, which arguably is where an emergency is most likely to occur.   Although the 
available type 402 lifejackets  would have increas ed the chances of people  surviving  in 
breaking seas , they were not the type  recommended for those conditions.  Wearer s would no t 
have been provided with the full 71  newtons of buoyancy  that the lifejackets were  capable of 
in calm water, due to  the breaking aerated water  over the bar at the time. 
4.7.5.  Additionally, the lifejackets were not, and not required to be, fitted with crotch strap s.  Even 
the higher -specification type 401 lifejacket s are not required to be fitted with crotch strap s.  

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -206 One of the passengers who died in this accident was wear ing his own inflatable type 401 
lifejacket, but it was not fitted with a crotch strap.  It is highly likely that upon entering the 
water he slipped straight out of his lifejacket before he could inflate it.   His lifejacket was 
later found uninflated.  
4.7.6.  The C ommission is of the view that for commercial operations in exposed open waters, 
particularly when vessel s are approved to operate out of bar harbours, the minimum 
requirement should be a type 401 lifejacket, and it should be required to have a crotch strap  
fitted.   For the same reasons , Maritime New Zealand should place some emphasis in its 
safety campaigns on recommending that recreational users adopt a similar standard when 
intending to cross bar harbours or venture into exposed coastal waters.  
4.7.7.  A recommen dation has been made to the Director of Maritime New Zealand to address this 
safety issue . 
Findings  
6. It is very likely that only three of the 11 people on board the Francie  were wearing 
lifejacket s of some description when the Francie  capsized while crossing the 
Kaipara  Harbour  bar.  No -one was wearing a lifejacket provided on board  in 
accordance with the M aritime Rules. 
7. It is virtually certain that everyone on board would have had a better chance of 
survival if they had been wearing a  lifejacket, and virtually certain that more 
people would have survived had the lifejackets been fitted with crotch straps.  
8. People have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing a lifejacket that is 
well fitted and of a type appropriate to the location and conditions where it will be 
used.  
9. The lifejackets on board the Francie  that were approved for use under  the 
Maritime Rules were not of a type appropriate for the nature of the Francie  
operation, which included crossing the Kaipara  Harbour  bar and operating off an 
exposed coastline.  
 
  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 23 >>
 5. Findings  
5.1. The forecast weather conditions , in combination with the state of the tide , were not suitable 
for the Francie  to head out over the Kaipara Harbour bar and make a safe return.  
5.2. The Francie  capsized when it was struck by a large breaking wave from behind while the 
skipper was distracted by making a radio call.  
5.3. Indications are that the skipper had a propensity to accept a high level of risk when deciding 
whether to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar. 
5.4. The skipper  had a propensity for crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar in high -risk conditions , 
which  was known to but not reported by others in the industry and community.   
5.5. A system is needed for people to make reports on safety -related concerns to Mariti me New 
Zealand to provide the regulator with more opportunity to intervene before accidents 
happen.  
5.6. It is very likely that only three of the 11 people on board the Francie  were wearing lifejacket s 
of some description when the Francie  capsized while crossin g the Kaipara Harbour bar.  No -
one was wearing a lifejacket provided on board in accordance with the M aritime Rules.  
5.7. It is virtually certain that everyone on board would have had a better chance of survival if 
they had been wearing a lifejacket, and virtua lly certain that more people would have 
survived had the lifejackets been fitted with crotch straps.  
5.8. People  have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing a lifejacket that is well fitted 
and of a type appropriate to the location and conditions where  it will be used.  
5.9. The lifejackets on board the Francie  that were approved for use under the Maritime Rules 
were not of a type appropriate for the nature of the Francie  operation, which included 
crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar and operating off an exposed coastline.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 6. Safety issues  
6.1. Some people are using the accident and incident reporting pr ocess to raise safety concerns 
because there is currently no dedicated , formal process within Maritime New Zealand where 
members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports on safety and 
security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected breaches of maritime 
legislation.  
6.2. Maritime rules t hat specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels are 
based only on how far the vessel s are permitted to travel from the coast.  The rules do not 
consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on 
expo sed coastlines, where higher -specification lifejacket s would be more appropriate . 
6.3. There are indications that people may not have a sufficient understanding of the design and 
capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or of the importance  of wearing a 
lifejacket of the correct size and type for any situation where there is a risk of people ending 
up in the water.  
 
 
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 25 >>
 7. Safety a ctions  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues 
that would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2.1.  Maritime New Zealand provides comprehensive advice, guidance and videos aimed at both 
commercial and recreational skippers on crossing bars, wearing lifejackets and being a safe 
skipper.   It also use s the Maritime N ew Zealand  and Safer Boating Facebook pag es and 
Twitter.  
7.2.2.  Maritime New Zealand provided funding for, and adv ertises on , MetService's marine weather 
app, on which both commercial and recreational skippers use to check the weather.   The 
app has 200,000 users a month and  includes advertisements that  remind boaties to wear 
lifejacket s and take VHF radio s.   
7.2.3.  Maritime New Zealand's lifejacket campaign has run on television  and in  print and digital 
media since 2011. The campaign has increased the number of boaties who say they carry 
lifejackets to more th an 90 %, and those who say they wear lifejackets all or most of the time 
to 76 %. 
7.3. Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3.1.  Shortly after the Francie  accident, Maritime New Zealand officers engaged personally with 
the eight commercial operators known to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar.  Included in that 
direct engagement were discussions about each operator's procedures and processes to 
ensure they met best practices on bar crossings .

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or 
organisation that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, 
depending on whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the 
wider transport sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to Maritime New 
Zealand.  
8.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Recommendatio ns 
8.2.1.  Maritime New Zealand receive s some information via its general enquiries contact point and 
also via its maritime officers' engagement with the community.  However, there would be 
some added benefit if there were  a similar process to that operated by the Civil Aviation 
Authority for people to report safety and security concerns . 
On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand 
develop , implement and advertise a process where members of the public and the maritime 
community can submit reports on maritime -safety -related concerns . (012/18)  
On 18 June 2018  Maritime New Zealand replied:  
Maritime NZ already has a system in place to receive, record and act upon reports 
relating to maritime -safety -related concerns from various public sources.  We also 
receive some information via our maritime officers' engagement with the community.  
Information so received, and its sources, are protected as far as possible, subject to 
the requiremen ts of the Privacy Act and Official Information Act.  As previously noted, 
without the appropriate legal provisions Maritime NZ's ability to operate a 
confidential reporting process similar to that operated by the Civil Aviation Authority 
is constrained.  
However, Maritime NZ is committed to continuing to implement and advertise its 
existing process where members of the public and the maritime community can 
submit reports on maritime -safety -related concerns.  We will actively promote the 
availability of this reporting process and look for opportunities to improve it where 
possible.  
8.2.2.  The Commission is of the view that for commercial operations in exposed open waters, 
particularly when vessel s are approved to operate out of bar harbours, the minimum 
requirement should be a type 401 lifejacket, and it should be required to have a crotch strap 
fitted.  For the same reasons , Maritime New Zealand should place some emphasis in its 
safety campaigns on recommending  that recreational users adopt a similar standard when 
intending to cross bar harbours or venture into exposed coastal waters . 
On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended  that the Director of Maritime New Zealand 
review the current requirements for the carriage of lifejackets on commercial restricted -limit 
vessels, and use an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the required lifej ackets are of an 
appropriate type for the type and place of operation . (013/18)  
On 18 June 2018 , Maritime New Zealand replied:  
I can confirm that Maritime NZ is prepared to undertake a review of the current 
requirements for the carriage of lifejackets on c ommercial restricted -limit vessels, to 
ensure that these produce the best safety outcomes.  This work will need to be 
prioritised against other work streams underway to improve boating safety, including 
ongoing efforts to promote the wearing of lifejackets  of an appropriate size and type 
by recreational and commercial boat users.  This will continue to be a focus of 
Maritime NZ's work.   
I am in the process of assigning responsibility for the review to an appropriate 
Maritime NZ work programme.  Once this h as been done, the first step will be a 
scoping exercise for the review, which I anticipate will take about a year to complete.  
 
Final Report MO -2016 -206 
<< Page 27 >>
 On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand 
use an appropriate mechanism to make it manda tory for crotch straps  to be fitted to 
lifejackets required on board commercial vessels that operate out of bar harbours and off 
exposed coastlines, (014/18) 
On 18  June 2018 , Maritime New Zealand replied:  
Maritime NZ will undertake a review of the current requirements for the carriage of 
lifejackets on commercial restricted -limits vessels.  This review will include analysis 
of the advantages and disadvantages, in terms of safety outcomes, of wearing 
lifejackets fitted with crotch straps.  Variou s issues to be considered relating to the 
use of crotch straps attached to lifejackets are canvassed in my letter of 9 May.  
Pending the outcome of the review, Maritime NZ is not in a position to indicate a 
timeframe for further action regarding the mandato ry fitting of crotch straps.  
Should the review ultimately conclude that crotch straps on lifejackets will improve 
safety outcomes, consideration could be given to making this a mandatory 
requirement.  This would require legislative change and would be a de cision for 
Ministers.  A recommendation to Ministers would need to be pursued through the 
Ministry of Transport.  
Meanwhile, Maritime NZ will continue to actively promote its safety messages to 
skippers of commercial vessels advocating the wearing of lifeja ckets of an 
appropriate type by every person on board during bar crossings.  
On 23 May 2018  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand 
continues to  emphasise to recreational boat users the benefits of having crotch straps fitted 
to their lifejackets.  (015/18) 
On 18 June 2018 , Maritime New Zealand replied:  
Maritime NZ confirms that it will continue to emphasise to recreational boat users 
the benefits of having crotch straps fitted to their lifejackets.  Promoting the use of 
lifejacke ts appropriate to the type and place of operation is one of the key safety 
messages of Maritime NZ's public boating safety campaign.  As noted in my 9 May 
letter, the Lifejackets Fact Sheet  available on the Maritime NZ website recommends 
the use of crotch straps to stop lifejackets riding up for situations other than very 
calm water, and points out that crotch straps are mandatory of all lifejackets work by 
children.  We will continue to draw attention to this important safety message.

 Final Report MO -2016 -206 9. Key l essons  
9.1 Extreme caution must be exercised when crossing bars  because s ea conditions can change 
for the worse in a very short time .  Waves can come from more than one direction and are 
usually larger  and steeper  than surrounding waters  and often breaking.  
9.2 Wearing a lifejacket will significantly improve the chances of survival if a person  
unexpectedly find s themselves in the water.  
9.3 When a person  wearing a lifejacket unexpectedly find s themselves in the water, their 
chances of surviving are significantly improved if the lifejacket is of the appropriate type for 
the conditions and size of the person, and is fitted with a crotch strap to p revent  their losing 
it when it rides up and over their head . 
9.4 The Maritime New Zealand website has useful information about selecting a proper lifejacket 
that best suits a person's  maritime activity, and how and when it should be worn .  
9.5 If a person  has concerns about the safety of any maritime activity, they should not hesitate 
to report them  to the appropriate maritime regulator.  This could help prevent accidents and 
save lives .
