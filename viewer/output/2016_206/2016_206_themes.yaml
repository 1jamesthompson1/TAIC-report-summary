- name: Decision to Cross the Kaipara Harbour Bar
  explanation: The decision to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar was a critical safety theme in this accident. The skipper chose to cross the bar despite the forecasted weather conditions and the state of the tide, which were not suitable for a safe return. The report states, "The forecast weather conditions, in combination with the state of the tide, were not suitable for the Francie to head out over the Kaipara Harbour bar and make a safe return" (5.1). Additionally, the skipper's decision-making process was flawed, as he had a propensity to accept a high level of risk when deciding whether to cross the bar, which was known but not reported by others in the industry and community (5.3, 5.4).
- name: Use of Lifejackets
  explanation: The use and type of lifejackets were significant safety themes in this accident. It is very likely that only three of the 11 people on board were wearing lifejackets of some description when the Francie capsized, and no one was wearing a lifejacket provided on board in accordance with the Maritime Rules (5.6). The report also highlights that people have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing a lifejacket that is well fitted and of a type appropriate to the location and conditions where it will be used (5.8). Furthermore, the lifejackets on board the Francie that were approved for use under the Maritime Rules were not of a type appropriate for the nature of the Francie operation, which included crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar and operating off an exposed coastline (5.9).
- name: Risk Perception and Acceptance
  explanation: The skipper's perception and acceptance of risk were central safety themes. The report indicates that the skipper had a propensity to accept a high level of risk when deciding whether to cross the Kaipara Harbour bar (5.3). This acceptance of risk was also evident in the skipper's history of crossing the bar in adverse conditions, which was known within the industry and community but not reported (5.4). The skipper's decision to cross the bar in the forecast weather conditions is an indication that he did not understand the risk he was taking or that the risk had become normalized over time and therefore not considered to be high (4.4.4).
- name: Reporting of Safety-Related Concerns
  explanation: The lack of a formal process for reporting safety-related concerns within Maritime New Zealand was a safety theme identified in the report. Some people were using the accident and incident reporting process to raise safety concerns because there was no dedicated, formal process for submitting reports on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected breaches of maritime legislation (4.5). This theme is critical as it suggests that there were missed opportunities for intervention that could have prevented the accident (5.5).
- name: Vessel Operating Limits and Required Lifejackets
  explanation: The vessel's operating limits and the types of lifejackets required by Maritime Rules were a safety theme. The Francie was approved to operate within restricted limits, which included crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar, but the lifejackets on board were not of a type appropriate for the conditions encountered (4.7.1, 4.7.2). The Maritime Rules did not consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours and on exposed coastlines, where higher-specification lifejackets would be more appropriate (4.7). This theme is relevant because it highlights a regulatory gap that affected the survivability of the Francie's passengers and crew (5.9).
- name: Safety Culture and Training
  explanation: The safety culture and training within the Francie's operation were underlying safety themes. The skipper's non-compliance with Maritime Rules and his low experience were factors that contributed to the accident (4.4.2). Additionally, the skipper's own written procedures around operational limits and bar crossings were exemplary on paper, but his actions did not reflect this understanding (4.4.3). The report also mentions that the skipper did not require everyone on board to wear a lifejacket when crossing the bar, which was not unusual among other skippers operating fishing charters on Kaipara Harbour (4.6.11, 4.6.12). This theme is relevant as it points to a discrepancy between written safety procedures and actual practices, as well as a broader issue of non-compliance and inadequate safety culture within the maritime community.
