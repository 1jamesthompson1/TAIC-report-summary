2016_206,013/18,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand review the current requirements for the carriage of lifejackets on commercial restricted-limit vessels, and use an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the required lifejackets are of an appropriate type for the type and place of operation.","The Commission is of the view that for commercial operations in exposed open waters, particularly when vessels are approved to operate out of bar harbours, the minimum requirement should be a type 401 lifejacket, and it should be required to have a crotch strap fitted. For the same reasons, Maritime New Zealand should place some emphasis in its safety campaigns on recommending that recreational users adopt a similar standard when intending to cross bar harbours or venture into exposed coastal waters.

On 23 May 2018 ","Some people are using the accident and incident reporting process to raise safety concerns because there is currently no dedicated, formal process within Maritime New Zealand where members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports on safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected breaches of maritime legislation.
