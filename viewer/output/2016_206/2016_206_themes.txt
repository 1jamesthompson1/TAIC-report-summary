Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Bar Crossing Risks: Crossing a sand bar is a high-risk activity due to quickly changing and unpredictable sea conditions, resulting in large and steep breaking waves. Sand bars form at the entrance to harbors and can amplify wave heights and confuse wave direction. The report emphasizes the dangers and complexities of crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar.

2. Risk Acceptance and Non-Compliance: The skipper of the Francie demonstrated a propensity for accepting a high level of risk and repeatedly non-complied with maritime rules. The skipper's decision to cross the bar in adverse weather conditions indicates a lack of understanding of the risks involved or a normalization of risk-taking behavior. The report also highlights the skipper's non-compliance with qualifications and regulations.

3. Lack of Safety Reporting Process: The report identifies a safety issue regarding the absence of a dedicated and formal process within Maritime New Zealand for members of the public and the maritime community to report safety and security concerns. This lack of reporting process hinders the ability to address safety concerns and intervene before accidents occur.

4. Insufficient Understanding of Lifejackets: There are indications that people may not have a sufficient understanding of the design and capability of different types of lifejackets, as well as the importance of wearing a properly fitted lifejacket for any situation with a risk of ending up in the water. The report highlights confusion and low appreciation for the importance of wearing lifejackets, as well as the need for education and awareness on lifejacket types and usage.

5. Inadequate Vessel Operating Limits: The maritime rules specifying the types of lifejackets to be carried on commercial vessels are based solely on the distance from the coast and do not consider environmental factors such as operating in bar harbors and exposed coastlines. The report suggests that higher-specification lifejackets should be required for vessels operating in such conditions.

6. Survivability Factors: The report emphasizes the importance of wearing lifejackets and the potential impact of crotch straps in increasing survivability. It highlights that not everyone on board the Francie was wearing a lifejacket, and those who were did not have crotch straps. The report also mentions the need for a better understanding of lifejacket types and their performance in different conditions.
