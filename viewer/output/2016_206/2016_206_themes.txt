Themes/causes present in the report:

1. High-risk activity of crossing a sand bar: Crossing a sand bar is a dangerous activity due to the quickly changing and unpredictable sea conditions, resulting in large and steep breaking waves.

2. Lack of understanding and appreciation for the risks involved: The skipper demonstrated a propensity for accepting a high level of risk and did not fully understand the risks involved in crossing the bar. There was also a broader cultural issue where people had a low appreciation of the importance of wearing lifejackets and did not understand the design and capability of different types of lifejackets.

3. Inadequate safety measures and regulations: The maritime rules specifying the types of lifejackets to be carried on commercial vessels were based solely on distance from the coast and did not consider environmental factors such as operating out of bar harbors and exposed coastlines. There was also a lack of a dedicated formal process for reporting safety concerns to Maritime New Zealand.
