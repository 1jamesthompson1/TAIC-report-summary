  \  \n4.1.1.  Crossing a sand bar is a high -risk activity , so much so that Maritime\
  \ New Zealand has \nproduced a National Code for Bar Crossing s (see Appendix 1).\
  \  Crossing a bar is dangerous \nbecause  the sea conditions can change quickly\
  \ and unpredictably , resulting in  unusually  \nlarge and  steep, and often confused\
  \ , breaking waves . \n4.1.2.  Sand bars  form  at the entrance to a harbour when\
  \  debris from the inner harbour and its \ntributaries is carried out by fast -flowing\
  \ currents and tides to be deposited near the harbour \nentrance.  Just like on\
  \ a beach, o cean waves increase in height and steepness as th ey move \ninto shallower\
  \ water over the  sand bar . \n4.1.3.  There is often a complex system of deeper\
  \ channels carved out through a sand bar by the \nsignificant tidal flow s into\
  \ and out of the harbour.  These  tidal flow s can further amplify the \nalready\
  \ rising steep wav es and even confuse the ir direction .  This effect is accentuated\
  \ when \nthe tidal flow is acting in the opposite direction to the ocean waves and\
  \ wind, especially \naround low tide when the depth of water over the bar is less\
  \  than at any other time . \n4.1.4.  The follow ing analysis discusses what happened\
  \ to the Francie  and how it came to be \noutside the Kaipara Harbour bar in adverse\
  \ conditions.  \n4.1.5.  The analysis  also discusses  three  safety issues : \n\
  \uF0B7 some people are using the accident and incident reporting process to raise\
  \ safety \nconcerns because there is currently no dedicated , formal process within\
  \ Maritime New \nZealand where members of the public and the maritime community\
  \ can submit reports \non safety and security concerns, including complaints and\
  \ allegations of suspected \nbreaches of maritime legislation  \n\uF0B7 maritime\
  \ rules that specify the types of lifejacket to be carried on commercial vessels\
  \ are \nbased only on how far the vessel s are permitted to travel fr om the coast.\
  \  The rules do \nnot consider environmental factors such as vessels operating out\
  \ of bar harbours and on \nexposed coastlines, where higher -specification lifejacket\
  \ s would be more appropriate  \n\uF0B7 there are indications that  people may not\
  \ have a suffic ient understanding of the design \nand capability of the various\
  \ types of lifejacket available, or of the importance of wearing \na lifejacket\
  \  of the correct size and type for  any situation where there is a risk of people\
  \ \nending up in the water.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The skipper's preferred\
  \ fishing ground was in the deeper water seaward of the Kaipara \nHarbour bar, which\
  \ meant leaving the shelter of the harbour and crossing the bar, and \nhaving to\
  \ cross the bar again to re -enter the harbour.  When  the Francie  reached the\
  \  \nentrance to the South Channel the sea conditions over the bar were reasonably\
  \ calm .  \nHowever,  it was close to high tide and the tide had only just begun\
  \ to ebb .  Based on what he \nobserved , the skipper decided to cross the bar.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  By the time  the Francie  appr oached the bar on the return journey\
  \ , the predicted southwest \nswell had likely increased and was interacting with\
  \ the already present low northwest swell.  \nThe tide was much lower , meaning\
  \ the depth of water over the bar had decreased .  A \npredicted increas e in wind\
  \ speed from the northwest may also have contributed to the state \nof the sea over\
  \ the bar . \n4.2.3.  Eye witnesses and Coastguard  crew who took part in the search\
  \ and rescue operation \nestimated  that the wave heights were between 4 m and 8\
  \ m. \n4.2.4.  Having decided t o make a second attempt to cross the bar, the skipper\
  \ was no more \nprepared than he had been  for the first attempt.  From interviews\
  \ with the survivors, it \nappears likely that o nly three of the 11 people on board\
  \ were wearing lifejackets .  It was \nreported that the skipper  only register\
  \ ed a bar watch with Coastguard  when prompted by one \n \nFinal Report MO -2016\
  \ -206 \n<< Page 15 >>\n of the passengers.  The National Code of Practice for Bar\
  \ Crossing s refers to the importance \nof posting a watch behind to warn the helmsman\
  \ of dangerous waves.   The skipper was \nreportedly distracted with registering\
  \ the bar watch when the Francie  was struck from behind \nby the large breaking\
  \ wave  that caused the vessel to capsize.  \n4.3. Decision to cross the Kaipara\
  \  Harbour  bar \n4.3.1.  The wave conditions that developed over t he Kaipara \
  \ Harbour  bar while the Francie  fished in \ndeeper water were entirely predictable\
  \ given the forecast conditions and the change in the \ntide. \n4.3.2.  The MetService\
  \ forecast was for n orthwest wind 15 knots rising to 25 knots in the evening, \n\
  with the sea beco ming rough.  A southwest swell  was predicted to develop and rise\
  \ to 3 m. \nThe prevailing 2 m northwest swell was predicted to ease .  Conditions\
  \ were predicted to \nworsen in the following  few days . \n4.3.3.  The skipper\
  \ was known to check weather forecasts routinely and had cancelled charter \nfishing\
  \ trips due to adverse forecast s before.  It could not be established whether he\
  \ had \nobtained the weather forecast on this occasion, but it is about as likely\
  \ as not that he had.  \n4.3.4.  The Francie 's MTOP acknowledge d that \"Extreme\
  \ caution must be exercised when crossing \nbars\" and that \"Before leaving harbour\
  \ the skipper must assess conditions on the bar [and] \nbe aware that a rapid change\
  \ in conditions might prevent a safe return to harbour and if in \ndoubt, should\
  \ not leave port \". \n4.3.5.  The MTOP also stated:  \n\uF0B7 \u2026 no trip [across\
  \ the bar] will proceed where the wind speed is predicted (taking \ninto account\
  \ meteorological surface pressure maps) to be above 30 knots  \n\uF0B7 \u2026 no\
  \ trip will proceed where there is forecast greater than a 3 metre swell or \ngreater\
  \ than a 2 -metre swell with a one-metre cross chop.  This will be further \nmodified\
  \ for when there is wind against tide/current and any degree of breaking \nwater.\
  \  \n4.3.6.  The National Code of Practice for Bar Crossing s gives some learned\
  \  advice that \"no amount  \nof experience or boat type makes crossing a bar SAFE\
  \ when the conditions are marginal or \nadverse. No situation warrants taking the\
  \ risk, so if in doubt 'STAY OUT '\", and \" adequate \nreserve fuel must be available\
  \ to enable the vessel to divert to another por t or safe haven \nshould adverse\
  \ bar conditions prevail on their return \".  This advice was included in the \n\
  Francie 's MTOP.  \n4.3.7.  There was feasibly  no viable alternative for the Francie\
  \  to enter a safe harbour.  There were \nother harbours to the south and north,\
  \ bu t these would have taken some time to reach and \nthey too were both bar harbours\
  \ , likely with wave conditions  similar  to those encountered \nover the Kaipara\
  \ Harbour bar. \n4.3.8.  The Francie  was set up for day charters only, so the option\
  \ of staying outside the bar \novernight , with 10 passengers on board  and with\
  \ inclement weather forecast , would have \nbeen  a difficult decision for the skipper\
  \ to make.  \n4.3.9.  His decision to persevere with a second attempt at enter ing\
  \ over the bar, in  spite of the \ndifficulties encountered wit h the first attempt\
  \ , was possibly a result of this lack of \nalternatives .   \n4.3.10.  This accident\
  \ highlights the importance of fully understanding the risks involved with \ncrossing\
  \ harbour bars and the various factors that can make them so unpredictable and \n\
  subject to rapidly changing sea conditions.  For an operation such as the Francie\
  \  fishing \ncharters, a trip begins and ends i nside Kaipara Harbour.  Because\
  \ of the limited options \nonce out over the bar, t he biggest risk is more about\
  \ what factors are going to affec t the \nability to get back in.  \n\n<< Page 16\
  \ >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -206 4.3.11.  In this case, indications are that the\
  \ skipper was deceived by the relatively benign conditions \nfor the outbound bar\
  \ crossing and either did not consider that they would likely change for \nthe inward\
  \ journey or did not fully ap preciate the risks involved.  This latter point is\
  \ discussed \nin the following section.  \nFinding s \n1. The forecast weather conditions\
  \ , in combination with the state of the tide , were \nnot suitable for the Francie\
  \  to head out over the Kaipara  Harbour  bar and make a \nsafe return . \n2. The\
  \ Francie  capsized when it was struck by a large breaking wave from behind \nwhile\
  \ the skipper was distracted by making a radio call.  \n \n4.4. Risk \n4.4.1.  When\
  \ the skipper first purchased the Francie  he had engaged a surveyor to inspect\
  \ the \nvessel  and issue a Fit for Purpose Certificate. The surveyor confirmed\
  \ that the skipper had \nconducted all of the work on the vessel that he had advised,\
  \  and that he had been  careful to \ndo as the surveyor requested with respect\
  \ to systems and equipment.  Engineering systems  \nwere the skipper 's area of\
  \ expertise.  \n4.4.2.  Regarding marine operations, the skipper demonstrated repeated\
  \ non -compliance with the \nMaritime Rules .  One reason for this could have been\
  \ his  low experience.  Another reason \ncould have been  his having a too high\
  \ acceptance of risk.   \n4.4.3.  The Commission compared the Francie 's MTOP to\
  \ those of other charter fishing vessels and \nfound  that its written procedures\
  \ around operational limits and bar crossing s were \nexemplary. The skipper himself\
  \ had researched and written the MTOP, and it reflected the \nbest practi ce described\
  \ by aforementioned authorities on bar crossing s.  On paper he \ndemonstrated an\
  \ understanding of the dangers of bar crossing.  \n4.4.4.  But t he skipper's decision\
  \ to cross the bar in the forecast weathe r conditions is an indication \nthat either\
  \  he did not understand the risk he was taking or that the risk had become \nnormalised\
  \ over time and therefore not considered to be high .  Other people who had \npreviously\
  \ sailed on the Francie described the skipper as  being 'comfortable' crossing the\
  \ \nbar in adverse conditions . \n4.4.5.  The person who had first skippered  the\
  \ Francie  had been  hired by the owner to operate the \nFrancie  and provide some\
  \ training for when the owner obtained his own skipper's certificate.  \nAfter about\
  \ one month the employed skipper  had resigned  because the Francie 's owner \n\
  would reportedly not listen to his advice or take instruction.  \n4.4.6.  The comments\
  \ made by the two other skippers  are supported by other data.  The \nCommission\
  \ obtained all of the trip and bar reports made to Coastguard  for the previous\
  \ two \nyears and obtained historical weather forecast data for the same period.\
  \   An analysis of this \ndata revealed that the Francie  had often crossed the\
  \ Kaipara Harbour bar in forecast poor \nweather cond itions, when other commercial\
  \ operators remained fishing within Kaipara \nHarbour.  \n4.4.7.  When compared\
  \ to all other operators, the Francie 's stood out as one of two operators who \n\
  routinely crossed the Kaipara  Harbour  bar in adverse weather conditions.  \n4.4.8.\
  \  After his skipper had resign ed, the Francie 's owner had acted as skipper  even\
  \ though  he did \nnot possess  the required qualification.   It is highly likely\
  \ that the owner had been  aware that \nhe was not complying with the M aritime\
  \ Rules in doing so.  \n4.4.9.  An identified compla inant  had notified Maritime\
  \ New Zealand  that the owner was acting as \nskipper without the required qualification.\
  \  Maritime New Zealand  subsequently conducted \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -206\
  \ \n<< Page 17 >>\n an inspection of the Francie  and found  that the unqualified\
  \ owner had acted  as skipper.  It \nissued a Notice of Imposition of Condit ions\
  \ against the vessel , which stated that the Francie  \nwas \"not to be op erated\
  \ commercially unless the m aster is the holder of a  Skipper Restricted \nLimit\
  \ s certificate \". \n4.4.10.  The process of bringing the vessel into survey had\
  \ taken  around 18 months ; however , during \nthat time the surveyor had come \
  \ to feel that the Francie 's owner did not a ppreciate the high \nlevel of risk\
  \ involved in crossing the Kaipara Harbour bar.  As a result the surveyor  had \n\
  imposed conditions on the vessel's Fit for Purpose Certificate in an attempt to\
  \ en sure that \nthe Francie  was operated safely:  \n\uF0B7 vessel to be operated\
  \ with all due care and attention to wind, waves, and weather \nconditions  \n\uF0B7\
  \ vessel to be operated over west coast bars in favourable condit ions only  \n\uF0B7\
  \ when operating within west coast limits, this vessel must be operated with a clear\
  \ \nweather window for the expected time of the voyage . \n4.4.11.  The evidence\
  \ suggests that the skipper had a tendency to not adhere strictly to the rules .\
  \  \nThis was also demon strated on the day  of the accident , when h e decided\
  \ to cross the bar \nwhen the forecast weather conditions would  have prevented\
  \ him doing so had he been \ncomplying strictly with the requirements of his Maritime\
  \ Transport Operator Certificate and \nthe associat ed MTOP, which he had written.\
  \  \n4.5. Reporting safety related concerns  \nSafety issue - Some people are using\
  \ the accident and incident reporting pr ocess to raise \nsafety concerns because\
  \  there is currently no dedicated , formal process within Maritime \nNew Zealand\
  \ where members of the public and the maritime community can submit reports \non\
  \ safety and security concerns, including complaints and allegations of suspected\
  \ \nbreaches of maritime legislation.  \n4.5.1.  Anecdotal evidence re ceived by\
  \ the Commission indicated  that some members of the \nmaritime community recognised\
  \ the danger posed by the skipper 's risk-taking behaviour.   \n4.5.2.  Maritime\
  \ New Zealand received four notifications regarding the Francie  from three people\
  \ , \nwhich included operating without an appropriately qualified skipper.  Maritime\
  \ New \nZealand 's response was to intervene, audit the operation , and ensure \
  \ that the offence  was \nnot repeated.  \n4.5.3.  Although Maritime New Zealand\
  \ does have  a formal accident and incident notification \nsystem, it is intended\
  \ for use by operators  or vessel s' crew  for notifying Maritime New \nZealand\
  \  of accident s and incident s involving vessel s.  \n4.5.4.  The Civil Aviation\
  \ Authority  has a dedicated process for anyone to report an aviation safety or\
  \ \nsecurity concern,  which  may include complaints or allegations of suspected\
  \ breaches of civil \naviation legislation.  The first point of contact with the\
  \ regulator is a dedicated phone \nnumber and email address, and any issue raised\
  \ automatically triggers a follow -up. \n4.5.5.  Maritim e New Zealand  does receive\
  \ some information via its general enquiries contact point \nand also via its maritime\
  \ officers ' engagement with the community .  However, there would \nbe some added\
  \ benefit if there were  a similar process to that operated by the C ivil Aviation\
  \ \nAuthority for people to report  safety and security concerns .   \n4.5.6.  The\
  \ Commission has made a recommendation to the Director of Maritime New Zealand that\
  \ \nhe consider providing and promoting a process for members of the public and\
  \ the maritime \ncomm unity to report safety and security concerns , including complaints\
  \ and allegations of \nsuspected breaches of maritime legislation.  \n\n<< Page\
  \ 18 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -206 Finding s \n3. Indications are that the skipper\
  \ had a propensity to accept a high level of risk \nwhen deciding whether to cross\
  \ the K aipara Harbour bar. \n4. The skipper  had a  propensity for crossing the\
  \ Kaipara Harbour bar in high -risk \nconditions , which  was known to but not reported\
  \ by others in the industry and \ncommunity.  \n5. A system is needed for people\
  \ to make report s of safety -related concerns to \nMaritime New Zealand to provide\
  \ the regulator with more opportunity to \nintervene before accidents happen.  \n\
  \ \n4.6. Survivability  \nLifejackets on board the Francie  \n4.6.1.  Post-mortem\
  \ examination s were  conducted of five of the recovered bodies.  The cause of \n\
  death was not ascertained for one of them.  For the other four, drowning was identified\
  \ as \nthe very likely cause of death.  \n4.6.2.  In a capsize situation, wearing\
  \ a lifejacket is no guarantee of survival.  People trapped  inside \na capsized\
  \ vessel can sustain injuries that prevent their escape, regardless of whether \n\
  lifejacket s are worn.  \n4.6.3.  Of the 11 people aboard the Francie , it is very\
  \ likely that only three of the passengers were \nwearing lifejackets  of some type\
  \ , and these were their own personal lifejackets.  Two of the \nthree passengers\
  \ who were wearing their own lifejackets died.  One of the deceased had \nbeen wearing\
  \ a type 401  inflatable lifejacket , but it was later recovered uninflat ed and\
  \ \nseparate from his body.  \n4.6.4.  Another  was wearing a lifejacket15 but he\
  \ was seen to struggle with staying afloat.  This \nlifejacket was also later recovered\
  \ separate ly from his body.  This shows that wearing a \nlifejacket will not automatically\
  \ guarantee survival for people who are thrown clear into the \nwater.  There are\
  \ other factors to be considered, such as the lifejacket being of the correct \n\
  size and type for the situation , and properly fitted .  These factors are considered\
  \ further \nbelow.  \n4.6.5.  Neither of the lifejackets referred to above was fitted\
  \ with a crotch strap.  A crotch strap can \nbe attached to a l ifejacket to prevent\
  \ the lifejacket riding up over the head of the survivor \nand potentially being\
  \ lost. The crotch strap is attached at the back of the lifejacket and it \npasses\
  \ between the wearer 's legs to attach at the front , as shown in Figure 3.  \n\
  \                                                        \n15 Later found to be\
  \ a buoyancy aid.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -206 \n<< Page 19 >>\n \nCrotch strap\
  \ \nFigure 3 \nType 402 lifejacket showing crotch strap  \n \n4.6.6.  In the case\
  \ of the passenger wearing his own type 401 inflatable lifejacket, if that had been\
  \ \nfitted with a crotch strap it very likely would have saved his life.  The other\
  \ deceased \npassenger was wearing a personal flo atation device that was not specifically\
  \ suitable for \nsupporting a person in rough breaking waters.  This was the passenger\
  \ seen by  survivors to \nbe struggling to stay afloat in spite of his wearing such\
  \ a device.  It is likely that he eventually \nslipped out of the personal flo atation\
  \ device, which would not have happened had it been \nfitted with a crotch strap.\
  \  In his case his chances  of survival would have increased if a \ncrotch strap\
  \ had been fitted.  \n4.6.7.  Although Maritime New Zealand  recommends the use\
  \ of crotch straps , it does not require \nthem to be fitted other than to children's\
  \ lifejackets.  \n4.6.8.  Notwithstanding the limitations of lifejacke ts, there\
  \ is no doubt that wearing one will \nincrease the chances of someone surviving\
  \ in the water .  It is likely that more people would \nhave survived this accident\
  \ had everyone been wearing a suitable lifejacket .  This is a key \nlesson arising\
  \ from this in quiry.  \n4.6.9.  Maritime Rules 40A prescribes the type and number\
  \ of lifejacket s that a commercial vessel \nsuch as the  Francie  should  carry,\
  \ but does not prescribe when they should be worn.  The \nactual use of the lifejacket\
  \ s is subject to the operator's  risk assessment process and \nresultant procedure\
  \ s covered in their MTOP.  \n4.6.10.  The Francie 's MTOP reflect ed the good practice\
  \ of having all aboard  wear lifejackets when \ncrossing the Kaipara Harbour bar.\
  \ The section  on bar crossing required lifejackets to be  \nworn, and the standing\
  \ orders stated: \"All passengers and crew must wear lifejackets at all \ntimes,\
  \ unless expressly given permission by the skipper \". \n4.6.11.  However, according\
  \ to survivors the skipper did not require everyone on board to wear a \nlifejacket\
  \ when cross ing the bar.  He was not wearing one himself.  \n4.6.12.  A survey\
  \ of the other vessels operating fishing charters on Kaipara Harbour revealed that\
  \ the \npractice of skippers not requiring people  to wear lifejackets was not un\
  \ usual.   This issue is \ndiscussed further in t he following section.  \n\n<<\
  \ Page 20 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -206 Use of suitable l ifejackets  \nSafety\
  \ issue - There are indications that people may not have a sufficient understanding\
  \ of \nthe design and capability of the various types of lifejacket available, or\
  \ of the importance of \nwearing a lifejacket of the correct size and type for any\
  \ situation where there is a risk of \npeople ending up in the water.  \n4.6.13.\
  \  There is a broader cultural issue underlying the failure of the people aboard\
  \ the Francie  to \nwear lifejackets.  Survivors described a reluctan ce themselves\
  \ to wear lifejackets and \ndescribed this as their normal behaviour . \n4.6.14.\
  \  During an interview the survivor who described his friend struggling to stay\
  \ afloat diminished \nthe importance of lifejackets by saying , \"He was wearing\
  \ a lifejacket and he died  anyway \".   \n4.6.15.  However, the deceased person\
  \ was not wearing a 'lifejacket ' as described by NZS 5823 ; he \nwas wearing a\
  \ personal floatation device and there is a substantial difference in \nperformance.\
  \  The survivor was unable to differentiate between t he variou s types of \nlifejacket.\
  \  T o him they were basically all the same.  \n4.6.16.  Recognised recreational\
  \ boating practices can be used as an indication of how the b roader  \npublic treats\
  \  the issue of wearing lifejacket s. The New Zealand Safer Boating Forum16 has\
  \ \nidentified that a failure to wear lifejacket s is overrepresented in fatalities\
  \ .  \n4.6.17.  Maritime New  Zealand  has recognised the failure to wear lifejacket\
  \ s as a safety issue. It has  \nconducted policy work for smaller craft, and a\
  \ significant educational campaign t o increase \nthe wearing  of lifejacket s.\
  \  Its program me also target s communities where the message \nabout the importance\
  \ of wearing lifejackets has not had  a good response.  \n4.6.18.  'Lifejacket '\
  \ has a specific technical meaning, but it is widely used by the public as a generic\
  \ \nterm to describe any safety device worn by an individual to help them float\
  \ when they are in \nthe water. There are other generic terms such as 'personal\
  \ floatation device ' and 'buoyancy \naid' that tend to be used to describe the\
  \ same thing.  \n4.6.19.  Similarly, there are many types of lifejacket within \
  \ those generic terms. The primary \ndifferences are the ir size, the performance\
  \ of the buoyancy they provide, and their intended \nuse.  \n4.6.20.  A Commission\
  \ survey of the Kaipara Harbour fishing charter fleet showed  some lack of \nawareness\
  \ of the types and names of lifejackets.  However, that lack of awareness is \n\
  indicative of a broader misunderstanding of the  types and names of lifejackets\
  \ in New \nZealand.  This confusion was recognised as an issue in NZS 5823:2005\
  \ , which state d in its \nforeword:  \nThis revision was initiated in response\
  \ to concerns being raised in the sector that \nexisting lifejackets were not always\
  \ accompanied by enough information to ensure \nthe purchasers were able to select\
  \ the most appropriat e devic e for their intended \nuse. \n4.6.21.  In New Zealand,\
  \ a primary source of information on lifejackets is Maritime New Zealand.  The \n\
  Maritime New Zealand website contains a section titled 'Lifejackets' , which provides\
  \ \neducational material on lifejackets, in cluding a sum mary of each type and\
  \ an example image \n(see Appendix 2 for full details). The following is  a list\
  \ of their names and types:  \n\uF0B7 open waters type 401 - inflatable  \n\uF0B7\
  \ open waters type 401 - semi -rigid \n\uF0B7 inshore waters type 402 (a semi -rigid\
  \ was the type carried on the Francie ) \n                                     \
  \                   \n16 The New Zealand Safer Boating Forum was establishe d to\
  \ co -ordinate and implement recreational \nboating safety initiatives. It is made\
  \ up of government agencies, local government, water safety and \nrecreational organisations,\
  \ and the marine industry.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -206 \n<< Page 21 >>\n \uF0B7\
  \ specialist lifejackets and personal floatation devices type 403 \n\uF0B7 buoyancy\
  \ aid and wetsuit type 404 \n\uF0B7 buoyancy garment type 405 \n\uF0B7 specialist\
  \ personal floatation device  type 406 . \n4.6.22.  The webpage also includes a\
  \ video that gives a comprehensive overview of lifejackets , \nincluding the types\
  \ and their uses . It also encourages users to understand the differences \nand\
  \ choose their lifejacket s carefully.  \n4.6.23.  Some of the differences between\
  \ the types of lifejacket are subtle, but some describe  critical \ndifferences\
  \ in performance.   In particular, a type 401 lifejacket  (as initially worn by\
  \ one of the \ndeceased)  has significantly more buoyancy than other types and will\
  \ maintain an \nunconscious person's face above water.  NZS 5823:2005 makes a distinction\
  \ between a \ntype 401 lifejacket and all the other types for that reason.  \n4.6.24.\
  \  Given t he circumstances of this accident, which indicate  that not even some\
  \ commercial \noperators have got the message about lifejackets; the comments from\
  \ the survivors of t his \naccident; and the general boating fatality statistics\
  \ it is clear  that the general public and the \nboating community have some way\
  \ to go before they fulfil their responsibility to their clients, \nfamilies and\
  \ friends to resolve this safety issue.  The in formation is there to be found and\
  \ the \nmessage is clear from the maritime regulators.  Normally the Commission\
  \ would mak e a \nrecommendation to address such a safety issue, but the efforts\
  \ of Maritime New Zealand \nand other boating forums arguably go far enou gh to\
  \ address the issue in the long term.  \n4.7. Vessel operating limits and required\
  \ lifejacket s \nSafety issue  - Maritime rules that specify the types of lifejacket\
  \ to be carried on commercial \nvessels are based only on how far the vessel s are\
  \ permitted to travel from the coast.  The \nrules do not consider environmental\
  \ factors such as vessels operating out of bar harbours \nand on exposed coastlines,\
  \ where higher -specification lifejacket s would be more \nappropriate . \n4.7.1.\
  \  It is almost certain that the lifejackets required to be provided on board  the\
  \ Francie  were not \nbeing worn  by anyone on board while  the Francie  cross ed\
  \ the Kaipara  Harbour  bar.  \nNotwithstanding this , the Commission considered\
  \ whether the types of lifejacket provided on \nboard were suita ble for the conditions\
  \ on the Kaipara  Harbour  bar that day.  \n4.7.2.  The Francie  had been  surveyed\
  \ and approved to operate within restricted limits (inshore).  In \npractice this\
  \ meant that the Francie 's operating area included Kaipara Harbour, outside the\
  \ \nharbour up  to 12 nm from the shore, and to designated north and south limits\
  \  (shown in \nFigure 2).  The operating area included the Kaipara  Harbour  bar,\
  \ therefore the Francie  was \napproved  to cross the bar as part of its normal\
  \ operations.  \n4.7.3.  The Maritime Rules require a restricted -limits vessel\
  \ to carry  type 402 lifejacket s for its \npassengers and crew.  NZS 5823 classes\
  \ type 402 lifejacket s as \"in-shore waters personal \nfloatation devices \" and\
  \ states  that lifejackets are \"anticipated for use on inshore waters \nwhere early\
  \  rescue may be expected \".  The presence of Coastguard , with its  reporting\
  \ and \nsearch and rescue systems , does increase the chance of early rescue, but\
  \ only provided the \nreporting systems are used and a distress message is able\
  \ to be made.  \n4.7.4.  Also, this accide nt demonstrates how quickly people can\
  \ succumb in rough breaking seas \nover a sand bar, which arguably is where an emergency\
  \ is most likely to occur.   Although the \navailable type 402 lifejackets  would\
  \ have increas ed the chances of people  surviving  in \nbreaking seas , they were\
  \ not the type  recommended for those conditions.  Wearer s would no t \nhave been\
  \ provided with the full 71  newtons of buoyancy  that the lifejackets were  capable\
  \ of \nin calm water, due to  the breaking aerated water  over the bar at the time.\
  \ \n4.7.5.  Additionally, the lifejackets were not, and not required to be, fitted\
  \ with crotch strap s.  Even \nthe higher -specification type 401 lifejacket s are\
  \ not required to be fitted with crotch strap s.  \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report\
  \ MO -2016 -206 One of the passengers who died in this accident was wear ing his\
  \ own inflatable type 401 \nlifejacket, but it was not fitted with a crotch strap.\
  \  It is highly likely that upon entering the \nwater he slipped straight out of\
  \ his lifejacket before he could inflate it.   His lifejacket was \nlater found\
  \ uninflated.  \n4.7.6.  The C ommission is of the view that for commercial operations\
  \ in exposed open waters, \nparticularly when vessel s are approved to operate out\
  \ of bar harbours, the minimum \nrequirement should be a type 401 lifejacket, and\
  \ it should be required to have a crotch strap  \nfitted.   For the same reasons\
  \ , Maritime New Zealand should place some emphasis in its \nsafety campaigns on\
  \ recommending that recreational users adopt a similar standard when \nintending\
  \ to cross bar harbours or venture into exposed coastal waters.  \n4.7.7.  A recommen\
  \ dation has been made to the Director of Maritime New Zealand to address this \n\
  safety issue . \nFindings  \n6. It is very likely that only three of the 11 people\
  \ on board the Francie  were wearing \nlifejacket s of some description when the\
  \ Francie  capsized while crossing the \nKaipara  Harbour  bar.  No -one was wearing\
  \ a lifejacket provided on board  in \naccordance with the M aritime Rules. \n7.\
  \ It is virtually certain that everyone on board would have had a better chance\
  \ of \nsurvival if they had been wearing a  lifejacket, and virtually certain that\
  \ more \npeople would have survived had the lifejackets been fitted with crotch\
  \ straps.  \n8. People have a low appreciation of the importance of wearing a lifejacket\
  \ that is \nwell fitted and of a type appropriate to the location and conditions\
  \ where it will be \nused.  \n9. The lifejackets on board the Francie  that were\
  \ approved for use under  the \nMaritime Rules were not of a type appropriate for\
  \ the nature of the Francie  \noperation, which included crossing the Kaipara  Harbour\
  \  bar and operating off an \nexposed coastline.  \n \n  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016\
