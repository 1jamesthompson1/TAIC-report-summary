","0.0","20.0","The pilot assumed the points to the maintenance depot were set correctly because he saw the derailer and stop-disc in place, without verifying their actual position, leading to the wrong-routing of the locomotives (4.2.8). Additionally, the maintainer did not padlock the derailer in place, despite being trained to do so, which is a human error (4.2.5).
","0.0","10.0","Although the maintainer had been trained in the use of the derailer padlock, the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan did not document a requirement for the derailer to be padlocked in place, indicating a gap in training and competency regarding the importance of this safety procedure (4.2.5).
