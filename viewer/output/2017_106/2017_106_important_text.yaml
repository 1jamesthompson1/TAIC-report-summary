  \ of the locomotives occurred because the points had been incorrectly set for \n\
  the intended movement.  Once the locomotives diverted towards the maintenance depot,\
  \ the \nderailer device should have caused the lead locomotive to derail and prevented\
  \ its unintended \nentry to the maintenance depot.  \n4.1.2.  The following  analy\
  \ sis discusses the circumstances that led to the collision .  It also discusses\
  \ \nthe safety issue  whereby the level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill\
  \ Joint \nOperating Plan was not robust in detecting and address ing compliance\
  \ issues in the \nInvercargill yard , including : \n\uF0B7 procedures for the completion\
  \ of safety -critical tasks were either poor or missing  \n\uF0B7 there was poor\
  \ adherence to existing safety procedures . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The\
  \ maintainer  arrived at the Invercargill maintenance depot  and check ed the work\
  \ schedule \nfor the day .  A shunt  locomotive was scheduled  to arrive at the\
  \ depot later in the day  to have \nthe driver's seat  repair ed.  \n4.2.2.  While\
  \  working on the  freight wagon inside the  depot , the maintainer  received a\
  \ phone call \nadvising that  the shunt locomotive  would arrive at Invercargill\
  \ after midday . \n4.2.3.  The maintainer left the depot around midday to collect\
  \ welding gas  cylinders .  While away from \nthe depot  the maintainer received\
  \ a further phone call advising  that the shunt locomotive  had \narrived in Invercargill.\
  \  Rather than wait for the shunt locomotive to be delivered to the \nmaintenance\
  \ depot , the maintainer drove to where the shunt  locomotive was located , \nremoved\
  \ the driver's seat and took it back to the maintenance depot to repair it.  \n\
  4.2.4.  On return ing to the maintenance depot the maintainer noticed  that the\
  \ derailer and stop -disc \nhad been removed  by someone , most likely  in preparation\
  \ for bringing the shunt locomotive \ninto the maintenance depot , which was now\
  \ no longer required .  It could not be established \nwho had removed the protection\
  \ ; however , the maintainer was the only person authorised to \ndo so.  The maintainer\
  \ reinstated  the st op-disc and plac ed the derailer back on the track  \nwithout\
  \ padlocking it in place .   \n4.2.5.  The design of the derailer meant it could\
  \ be padlocked in place, and a padlock was provided \nfor this purpose.  The maintainer\
  \ had been trained in the use of the derailer padlock ; however, \nthe Invercargill\
  \ Joint Operating Plan  did not document a require ment for  the derailer to be\
  \ \npadlocked in place .  \n4.2.6.  The Invercargill Joint Operating Plan  detailed\
  \ how staff from KiwiRail Mechanical and KiwiRail  \nOperations worked together\
  \ in and around the maintenance depot.   While the maintainer was \nresponsible\
  \ for remo ving and reinstating  the derailer and stop -disc depot protection, \n\
  operations staff , in this case the pilot , were  responsible for setting the poin\
  \ ts correct ly.   \n4.2.7.  After completing the repair to  the driver's  seat,\
  \ the depot maintainer drove  back to the shunt \nlocomotive and refitted it . \
  \ The maintainer then r eturn ed to the maintenance depot and \nparked the  maintenance\
  \ truck on the track outside the doorway to the building.  \n4.2.8.  Meanwhile,\
  \ a djacent to the maintenance depot , the pilot and train driver were preparing\
  \ to \nmove  the locomotives to the refuelling area.  The pilot walked across and\
  \ confirmed  that the \npoints to the refuelling bay were set correctly , but did\
  \ not check that the points to the \nmaintenance depot were set  correctly .  The\
  \ pilot assumed that they were set correctly because \nhe saw  the d erailer and\
  \ stop -disc in place.  \n\n<< Page 8 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -106 4.2.9.  Once\
  \ the train driver was authorised to setback to the refuelling area, t he pilot\
  \ drove to the \nrefuelling bay  as the locomotives setback .  When  piloting from\
  \ a vehicle, Rule 4.2.1 of the New \nZealand Rail Operating Code states in part\
  \ that:  \n4.2.1 Range of Vision  \nMaintaining a Range of Vision when Piloting\
  \ by Quad bike or Vehicle  \no Travel a safe distance ahead of the movement immediately\
  \ adjacent to and clear \nof the intended route  \n4.2.10.  Due to the setback movement\
  \ being a relatively short distance, the pilot dr ove ahead to the \nrefuelling\
  \ area  in order to be in the desired place to call the rail movement to a halt\
  \ when the \nlocomotives arrived .  This was an accepted and normal action among\
  \  pilots.  However, b y not \ntravelling the inten ded route  just ahead and  clear\
  \ of the locomotives , the pilot missed the \nopportunity to observ e the locomotives\
  \ divert ing towards  the maintenance depot.  \n4.2.11.  A post -incident re -enactment\
  \ revealed that the derailer protruded sufficiently above the rail  to \nmake contact\
  \ with  the cowcatcher15 of the leading locomotive.  T he design specification \
  \ of the \nderailer permitted  it to have  a height of up to 120 millimetres  above\
  \ the top of the rail , while \nthe cowcatcher was permitted to have a height above\
  \ the rail as low as 100 millimetres .  As a \nresult the cowcatcher tore  the derailer\
  \ off its mounts before it could perform its purpose of \nderail ing the locomotives\
  \  (see Figure 8) .  KiwiRail is undertaking a review of the suitability of \nits\
  \ derailers for its current rolling stock.  \n \nFigure 8  \nDerailer (pictured\
  \ during post -incident re -enactment)  \n4.3. Rules and p rocedures  \nSafety issue\
  \ - The level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating\
  \ Plan were not \nrobust in detecting and  address ing compliance issues in the\
  \ Invercargill yard . \nProtection for the maintenance depot  \n4.3.1.  As previously\
  \ discussed, the procedures in the Joint Operating Plan specified that operations\
  \ \nstaff were responsible for all rail rolling stock movements and mechanical personnel\
  \ were \nresponsible for the placement  and removal of the derailer and stop -disc.\
  \ \n                                                        \n15 A strong , angled\
  \ metal plate, similar in appearance to a snow plough, fitted to the front and rear\
  \ of a \nlocomotive.  Its purpose is to reduce the risk of derailment in the event\
  \ of a collision between the locomotive  \nand a large obstacle on the track . It\
  \ is sometimes known as an obstacle deflector . \n\nFinal Report RO -2017 -106 \n\
  << Page 9 >>\n 4.3.2.  This split of responsibility required operations staff  to\
  \ liaise with mechanical staff to have  the \nmaintenance depot protection removed\
  \ before any rail movement s into or out of the \nmaintenance depot siding could\
  \ take place.  \n4.3.3.  The design of the derailer allo wed it to be padlocked\
  \ in place to prevent unauthorised \nremoval .  However, t he Joint Operating Plan\
  \ did not mention the need to use a padlock and \ntherefore the derailer was often\
  \ left unlocked.  In not using the padlock it was easy for any \nstaff to remove\
  \ the derailer for rail vehicle movements into and out of the depot.  Even when\
  \ it \nwas locked the key was easily accessible, which meant the  protection  could\
  \ be removed by \nanyone, including o perations personnel.   \n4.3.4.  The practice\
  \ of operational  staff removing a nd reinstating the depot protection was a violation\
  \ \nof the instructions in the Joint Operating Plan.  The practice had never been\
  \ identi fied by the \nsite management . \n4.3.5.  Rule 909 of the New Zealand Rail\
  \ Operating Rules and Procedures refers to w orking in non -\ninterlocked16 area\
  \ s, where the movement of a rail vehicle is controlled by manually operated \n\
  points and authorised by a pilot .  The rule states  (in part ): \nIf points can\
  \ be set to prevent entry into the track(s) being protected they must be \nlocked/spiked\
  \ or bolted in this position . \nThe Joint Operating Plan had not considered using\
  \ the points leading to the maintenance \ndepot building as part of the depot protection.\
  \   \n4.3.6.  Subsequent to this incident the use of the derailer has been discontinued\
  \ and the points \nleading to the maintenance depot siding are now set away from\
  \ the depot and padlocked in \nthis position.  The maintainer now controls the use\
  \ of the padlock key and the system now \ncomplies with Rule 909.  \nPiloting trains\
  \  \n4.3.7.  When piloting a rail vehicle , Rule 124 of the New Zealand Rail Operating\
  \ Rules and \nProcedures states in part that the pilot must:  \nCheck that any points\
  \ are correctly set between the train and the agreed \nfeature/location (destination)\
  \ . \n4.3.8.  As previously mentioned, the pilot did not fully c heck the setting\
  \ of the points to the \nmaintenance depot to ensure that they were set for the\
  \ intended movement , instead making \nan assumption that they were correctly set\
  \ based on the presence of the stop -disc and \nderailer protection.  \n4.3.9. \
  \ The Commission  noted t hat Rule 124 is titled ' Propelling of V ehicles on Main\
  \ Line', however it \nfound that  pilots are trained to apply this rule to all lines\
  \ including depots, terminals, yards \nand sidings.   In the field,  pilots actively\
  \ demonstrate  the principle of applying Rule  124 to all \nlines.  KiwiRail are\
  \ aware that  Rule 124's  wording is not aligned with current practice and are \n\
  working to updat e the rulebook . \nRefuelling procedures  \n4.3.10.  As the original\
  \ plan was for the locomotives to be taken  to the refuelling area  for refuelling,\
  \ the \nCommission sought to review the procedures for this task, but there were\
  \ no procedures .  \nRefuelling is a  task that has potential environmental and\
  \ safety risks.  Although not a factor \ncontributing to this incident, it  is another\
  \ example  of a system that would benefit from another \nlevel of audit and control\
  \ . \n                                                        \n16 Sidings where\
  \ points and signalling are hand operated and are not arranged to prevent conflicting\
  \ \nmovements.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -106 Summary  \n4.3.11.\
  \  The incident highlights the importance of having clear , documented procedures\
  \  in place that \nconform with any overarching rules and/or standards . It also\
  \ highlights the importa nce of  \nfollowing procedures  that are in place , namely:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 had the set of points leading to the maintenance depot been controlled\
  \ in accordance with \nRule 909, it is very likely that they would have been set\
  \ in the co rrect position for the \nmovement  \n\uF0B7 had the set of points to\
  \ the maintenance depot been checked before the locomotives \nentered the siding,\
  \ it is virtually certain that it would have been noticed that they were set  \n\
  incorrectly  \n\uF0B7 notwithstanding these first two points, had the moving locomotives\
  \ bee n within sight of the \npilot, it is about as likely as not that the wrong\
  \ -routing would have been noticed in time to \navoid a collision at the maintenance\
  \ depot  \n\uF0B7 had the incompatibility  between the design s of the derailer\
  \ and the cowcatcher on the lead \nlocomo tive been identified, it would have been\
  \ known that  without a redesign  the derailer \nwould not have performed its function\
  \ and derailed the lead locomotive before it reached \nthe maintenance depot . \n\
  4.3.12.  An effective check and audit regime ought to have identified  one or more\
  \ of these issues, and \nthe incident avoided.  Indications are that there was little\
  \ in the way of auditing the Invercargill \nJoint Operating Plan .  Consequently\
  \ the non -conformities and examples of non -compliance \nfound within the yard\
  \ went unchec ked. \n4.3.13.  KiwiRail has since undertaken safety action s to address\
  \ this safety issue at the Invercargill \nyard and to improve compliance  in other\
  \ yards throughout its New Zealand network .  \nFinal Report RO -2017 -106 \n<<\
