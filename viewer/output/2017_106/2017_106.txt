The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations t o improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domesti cally and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At 1503 o n Thursday 16 November 2017, two coupled  mainline locomotives were being 
moved from the main line to a refuelling area  at Invercargill .  However, the points  were not set 
for the intended route and the locomotives were instead diverted into the  rail maintenance 
depot . 
1.2. The locomotives collided wit h a truck that was parked outside  the maintenance depot, 
propelling it into a freight wagon that was parked in side the depot for repair work.  Both ends 
of the truck were damaged, but nobody was injured.  
1.3. A protective derailing device had been placed on to the rail outside the maintenance depot.  
The device was designed to derail any rail vehicle inadvertently entering the track that led to 
the depot.  However, the cowcatcher on the front of the lead locomotive dislodged the derailer  
and prevented it derailin g the locomotive.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found that the locomotives 
were wrong -routed off the intended route and  into the maintenance depot siding because the 
necessary checks to ensure that the points were set in the correct position for the movement 
were not made.  
1.5. The Commission also found  that the procedures in the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan for 
protecting the maintenance depot from unintended rail movements did not conform  fully with 
the KiwiRail rules, and that there were indications that staff were routinely not complying with 
the procedures set out in the plan. 
1.6. The level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan w as not 
robust in detecting and address ing compliance issu es within the Invercargill yard.  
1.7. The Commission identified one safety issue - that the level of audit and compliance testing of 
the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan w as not robust in detecting and address ing compliance 
issues within the Invercargill yard.  
1.8. KiwiRail Holdings Limited took a number of safety actions  to address th is safety issue .  
Consequently , the Commission has made no recommendations arising from this inquiry . 
1.9. Key lesson s arising from th is inquiry include : 
 it is important to ensure that documented rules, policies and procedures are compatible 
and consistent across all places of work in the rail network  
 a culture of non -compliance can quickly develop if staff are not prompted to follow the 
proper procedures when undertaking their duties, a nd do not  challenge their work 
colleagues if they observe them not following procedures.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  At approximately 1455 on 16 November 2017, a  freight train consisting of two locomotives 
and a number of freight wagons  arrived at Invercargill .  The driver contacted Train Control,  
cancell ed the track warrant4 and obtained a p roceed signal for a setback5 movement  onto the 
Bluff m ain line to disconnect the wagons .  The setback movement was under the control of a 
pilot.  The driver  radioed the p ilot and obtained  permission to setback . 
 
Figure 2 
Schematic of train movements  
 
3.1.2.  The train then setback onto the Bluff main line , where  the pilot disconnected  the wagons from 
the locomotives (position i in Figure 2) .  The pilot then told the driver to contact Train Control 
and request  a signal to move the locomotives  forward  past a set of  points that would give the 
locomotives access to the siding6 that branched into  the storage yard, the refuelling area and 
the maintenance depot.  The intention was to move the locomotive s into the refuelling area .  
When  the correct signal was obtained  the driver moved the locomotives forward and  stopp ed 
beyond the points (position ii in Figure 2 ). 
3.1.3.  With the locomotives clear of the points to the Bluff Main Line  (position ii in Figure 2) , the pilot 
was able to  set the points  and authoris e the locomotives to setback to  enter the siding for the 
refuelling area .  Once in the siding the locomotives had to pass through two more sets of 
points in order to reach the refuelling area .  The first set of points could  direct trains to the 
maintenance depot and the second set could direct  trains to either the storage yard or the 
refuelling area . 
3.1.4.  The pilot walked from the Bluff main  line, where the wagons had been disconnected,  directly 
to the second set of points to set them for the locomotives to enter  the refuelling area  (see 
Figure 3).   The pilot observed  that on the adjacent maintenance depot line a derailer7 and 
stop-disc8 were in place , protecting the maintenance depot .  In the pilot 's previous experience 
the presence of the depot protection meant that the first set of points was not directing rail 
vehicles  to the maintenance depot, so did not visually  check the setting of the points .

3.1.5.  The pilot advised the driver that the points were  set and authorised the driver  to setback 
towards  the refuel ling area .  However, the first set of points were  set for rail vehicles  to enter 
the maintenance depot (see Figure 4).  The driver  was positioned in the trail  locomotive9 so 
could not see ahead in the direction of travel , but proceeded to reverse  the locomotives at 
about  15km/h  under the instruction of the p ilot.  As the locomotives  setback , the pilot used a 
road vehicle  to drive approxi mately 150 metres to the refuelling area  to meet the locomotives  
and call a halt to the movement.

3.1.6.  As the locomotives reversed the driver noticed  they had diverted and were heading  toward s 
the maintenance depot instead of the refuelling area  (position iii in Figure 2 ).  The lead 
locomotive11 overcame  the maintenance depot protection  by knock ing the stop -disc flat and

3.1.7.  The driver applied the locomotive brakes and brought them  to a stop , but not before the lead 
locomotive had collided with a maintenance truck parked on the track outside  the depot.  
3.1.8.  The maintenance truck had been parked in neutral over the track leading  to the maintenance 
depot , with the handbrake  lightly applied.  The coupler12 at the rear of the locomotive s struck  
the maintenance truck . 
3.1.9.  The truck was propelled13 back approximately 15 metres and collided  with the coupler of a 
freight wagon that was chocke d14 inside the ma intenance facility (see Figure 6).  The 
maintainer  was in another room in the depot when the collision occurred .  The front and rear 
of the truck suffered  moderate  impact damage.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The wrong -routing of the locomotives occurred because the points had been incorrectly set for 
the intended movement.  Once the locomotives diverted towards the maintenance depot, the 
derailer device should have caused the lead locomotive to derail and prevented its unintended 
entry to the maintenance depot.  
4.1.2.  The following  analy sis discusses the circumstances that led to the collision .  It also discusses 
the safety issue  whereby the level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint 
Operating Plan was not robust in detecting and address ing compliance issues in the 
Invercargill yard , including : 
 procedures for the completion of safety -critical tasks were either poor or missing  
 there was poor adherence to existing safety procedures . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The maintainer  arrived at the Invercargill maintenance depot  and check ed the work schedule 
for the day .  A shunt  locomotive was scheduled  to arrive at the depot later in the day  to have 
the driver's seat  repair ed.  
4.2.2.  While  working on the  freight wagon inside the  depot , the maintainer  received a phone call 
advising that  the shunt locomotive  would arrive at Invercargill after midday . 
4.2.3.  The maintainer left the depot around midday to collect welding gas  cylinders .  While away from 
the depot  the maintainer received a further phone call advising  that the shunt locomotive  had 
arrived in Invercargill.  Rather than wait for the shunt locomotive to be delivered to the 
maintenance depot , the maintainer drove to where the shunt  locomotive was located , 
removed the driver's seat and took it back to the maintenance depot to repair it.  
4.2.4.  On return ing to the maintenance depot the maintainer noticed  that the derailer and stop -disc 
had been removed  by someone , most likely  in preparation for bringing the shunt locomotive 
into the maintenance depot , which was now no longer required .  It could not be established 
who had removed the protection ; however , the maintainer was the only person authorised to 
do so.  The maintainer reinstated  the st op-disc and plac ed the derailer back on the track  
without padlocking it in place .   
4.2.5.  The design of the derailer meant it could be padlocked in place, and a padlock was provided 
for this purpose.  The maintainer had been trained in the use of the derailer padlock ; however, 
the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan  did not document a require ment for  the derailer to be 
padlocked in place .  
4.2.6.  The Invercargill Joint Operating Plan  detailed how staff from KiwiRail Mechanical and KiwiRail  
Operations worked together in and around the maintenance depot.   While the maintainer was 
responsible for remo ving and reinstating  the derailer and stop -disc depot protection, 
operations staff , in this case the pilot , were  responsible for setting the poin ts correct ly.   
4.2.7.  After completing the repair to  the driver's  seat, the depot maintainer drove  back to the shunt 
locomotive and refitted it .  The maintainer then r eturn ed to the maintenance depot and 
parked the  maintenance truck on the track outside the doorway to the building.  
4.2.8.  Meanwhile, a djacent to the maintenance depot , the pilot and train driver were preparing to 
move  the locomotives to the refuelling area.  The pilot walked across and confirmed  that the 
points to the refuelling bay were set correctly , but did not check that the points to the 
maintenance depot were set  correctly .  The pilot assumed that they were set correctly because 
he saw  the d erailer and stop -disc in place.  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -106 4.2.9.  Once the train driver was authorised to setback to the refuelling area, t he pilot drove to the 
refuelling bay  as the locomotives setback .  When  piloting from a vehicle, Rule 4.2.1 of the New 
Zealand Rail Operating Code states in part that:  
4.2.1 Range of Vision  
Maintaining a Range of Vision when Piloting by Quad bike or Vehicle  
o Travel a safe distance ahead of the movement immediately adjacent to and clear 
of the intended route  
4.2.10.  Due to the setback movement being a relatively short distance, the pilot dr ove ahead to the 
refuelling area  in order to be in the desired place to call the rail movement to a halt when the 
locomotives arrived .  This was an accepted and normal action among  pilots.  However, b y not 
travelling the inten ded route  just ahead and  clear of the locomotives , the pilot missed the 
opportunity to observ e the locomotives divert ing towards  the maintenance depot.  
4.2.11.  A post -incident re -enactment revealed that the derailer protruded sufficiently above the rail  to 
make contact with  the cowcatcher15 of the leading locomotive.  T he design specification  of the 
derailer permitted  it to have  a height of up to 120 millimetres  above the top of the rail , while 
the cowcatcher was permitted to have a height above the rail as low as 100 millimetres .  As a 
result the cowcatcher tore  the derailer off its mounts before it could perform its purpose of 
derail ing the locomotives  (see Figure 8) .  KiwiRail is undertaking a review of the suitability of 
its derailers for its current rolling stock.

4.3. Rules and p rocedures  
Safety issue - The level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan were not 
robust in detecting and  address ing compliance issues in the Invercargill yard . 
Protection for the maintenance depot  
4.3.1.  As previously discussed, the procedures in the Joint Operating Plan specified that operations 
staff were responsible for all rail rolling stock movements and mechanical personnel were 
responsible for the placement  and removal of the derailer and stop -disc. 
                                                        
15 A strong , angled metal plate, similar in appearance to a snow plough, fitted to the front and rear of a 
locomotive.  Its purpose is to reduce the risk of derailment in the event of a collision between the locomotive  
and a large obstacle on the track . It is sometimes known as an obstacle deflector .

<< Page 9 >>
 4.3.2.  This split of responsibility required operations staff  to liaise with mechanical staff to have  the 
maintenance depot protection removed before any rail movement s into or out of the 
maintenance depot siding could take place.  
4.3.3.  The design of the derailer allo wed it to be padlocked in place to prevent unauthorised 
removal .  However, t he Joint Operating Plan did not mention the need to use a padlock and 
therefore the derailer was often left unlocked.  In not using the padlock it was easy for any 
staff to remove the derailer for rail vehicle movements into and out of the depot.  Even when it 
was locked the key was easily accessible, which meant the  protection  could be removed by 
anyone, including o perations personnel.   
4.3.4.  The practice of operational  staff removing a nd reinstating the depot protection was a violation 
of the instructions in the Joint Operating Plan.  The practice had never been identi fied by the 
site management . 
4.3.5.  Rule 909 of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures refers to w orking in non -
interlocked16 area s, where the movement of a rail vehicle is controlled by manually operated 
points and authorised by a pilot .  The rule states  (in part ): 
If points can be set to prevent entry into the track(s) being protected they must be 
locked/spiked or bolted in this position . 
The Joint Operating Plan had not considered using the points leading to the maintenance 
depot building as part of the depot protection.   
4.3.6.  Subsequent to this incident the use of the derailer has been discontinued and the points 
leading to the maintenance depot siding are now set away from the depot and padlocked in 
this position.  The maintainer now controls the use of the padlock key and the system now 
complies with Rule 909.  
Piloting trains  
4.3.7.  When piloting a rail vehicle , Rule 124 of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and 
Procedures states in part that the pilot must:  
Check that any points are correctly set between the train and the agreed 
feature/location (destination) . 
4.3.8.  As previously mentioned, the pilot did not fully c heck the setting of the points to the 
maintenance depot to ensure that they were set for the intended movement , instead making 
an assumption that they were correctly set based on the presence of the stop -disc and 
derailer protection.  
4.3.9.  The Commission  noted t hat Rule 124 is titled ' Propelling of V ehicles on Main Line', however it 
found that  pilots are trained to apply this rule to all lines including depots, terminals, yards 
and sidings.   In the field,  pilots actively demonstrate  the principle of applying Rule  124 to all 
lines.  KiwiRail are aware that  Rule 124's  wording is not aligned with current practice and are 
working to updat e the rulebook . 
Refuelling procedures  
4.3.10.  As the original plan was for the locomotives to be taken  to the refuelling area  for refuelling, the 
Commission sought to review the procedures for this task, but there were no procedures .  
Refuelling is a  task that has potential environmental and safety risks.  Although not a factor 
contributing to this incident, it  is another example  of a system that would benefit from another 
level of audit and control . 
                                                        
16 Sidings where points and signalling are hand operated and are not arranged to prevent conflicting 
movements.

 Final Report RO -2017 -106 Summary  
4.3.11.  The incident highlights the importance of having clear , documented procedures  in place that 
conform with any overarching rules and/or standards . It also highlights the importa nce of  
following procedures  that are in place , namely:  
 had the set of points leading to the maintenance depot been controlled in accordance with 
Rule 909, it is very likely that they would have been set in the co rrect position for the 
movement  
 had the set of points to the maintenance depot been checked before the locomotives 
entered the siding, it is virtually certain that it would have been noticed that they were set  
incorrectly  
 notwithstanding these first two points, had the moving locomotives bee n within sight of the 
pilot, it is about as likely as not that the wrong -routing would have been noticed in time to 
avoid a collision at the maintenance depot  
 had the incompatibility  between the design s of the derailer and the cowcatcher on the lead 
locomo tive been identified, it would have been known that  without a redesign  the derailer 
would not have performed its function and derailed the lead locomotive before it reached 
the maintenance depot . 
4.3.12.  An effective check and audit regime ought to have identified  one or more of these issues, and 
the incident avoided.  Indications are that there was little in the way of auditing the Invercargill 
Joint Operating Plan .  Consequently the non -conformities and examples of non -compliance 
found within the yard went unchec ked. 
4.3.13.  KiwiRail has since undertaken safety action s to address this safety issue at the Invercargill 
yard and to improve compliance  in other yards throughout its New Zealand network .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The locomotives were wrong -routed into the maintenance depot because the necessary 
checks to ensure that the points were set correctly for the movement were not made.  
5.2. The procedures in the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan  for protecting the maintenance de pot 
from unin tended rail movements did not conform with the KiwiRail rules. 
5.3. Indications are that staff were routinely not complying with the procedures set out in the 
Invercargill Joint Operating Plan . 
5.4. The level of audit and compliance testing of the Inver cargill Joint Operating Plan  were not 
robust in detecting and address ing compliance issues in the Invercargill yard.

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. In response to this  incident , and due to the recent high number of collisions in yards,  KiwiRail  
introduced a  maximum speed limit  of 15km/h  for all movements within yards, terminals and 
sidings.  
7.3. On 21 November 2017 KiwiRail held a one -hour safety stop meeting at each facility to discuss 
with all staff the reasons for shunting collisions occur ring and to identify ideas for preventing 
collisions.  A total of 472 pieces of feedback were  received, including  369 regarding  why 
collisions might be occurring and 72 ideas to prevent collisions.   
7.4. On 11 June 2018 a follow -up safety stop meeting was held to feed  back on progress made 
from the initial meeting and to share ideas across different teams and locations.  
7.5. The safety stop meetings were used to reinforce the New Zealand Rail Operating Code , 
Section 5.1, Shunting Procedures  - Rule 4.2.1 : 
4.2.1 Range of Vision  
Range of vision means that a member of the shunt crew must signal the movement 
from a position at or near the head of the movement in the direction of travel; this 
will ensure a clear view of the intended route.  
The range of vision will be influenced by things like weather, buildings, grade and 
time of day and may require significant movement on the part of the shunter in order 
to maintain range of vision.  
Maintaining a Range of Vision when Piloting by Quad bike or Vehicle  
o Travel a safe distance ahead of the movement immediately adjacent to and 
clear of the intended route  
o Pilot vehicles must be restricted to designated road vehicle route when 
piloting  
o The movement must be stopped and the way must be clear before driving 
across or fouling the track on which the vehicles are moving  
 When driving a quad bike approved hands -free equipment must be 
used if operati ng a radio or cell phone . 
7.6. Additionally, New Zealand Rail Operating Code , Section 5.1  - Rule 5.3.2 Radio Commands 
was reinforced:  
5.3.2 Radio Commands  
When shunting and piloting:  
o The pilot / shunter MUST maintain radio contact with the Locomotive Operator  
o The pilot / shunter MUST initiate radio communications at 10 second intervals  
o The movement is to be stopped if there is no communication, or 
communication is broken . 
The initial instruction to move must:  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -106 o Advise where the movement is to move from taking acc ount of position of the 
locomotive and where it is to end.  In other words the direction and distance to 
travel must be identified.  
o The person receiving the information must repeat it back to confirm the 
instruction is understood before the movement commen ces. 
o Where appropriate the actual road or siding name is to be used.  
o The Locomotive Operator must have a clear understanding of what direction to 
move in given their knowledge of the yard layout.  
The Locomotive Operator must be advised if the movement is i nto an empty or 
occupied road.  If the movement is into an occupied road the distance to the 
stationary vehicles must be called.  
The Pilot / Shunter must start calling lengths to go towards a ny stationary object 
with a wago n "countdown" as follows:  
10 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 1 - ½ - STOP  
(Repeat the command "STOP" several times until the Locomotive Operator has 
responded to the call.)  
Terms such as "Steady", "Stop", "Ease Up", and "Out Short" will apply when a 
member of the shunting gang is giving instructions to  the Locomotive Operator for 
example bogies to go . 
The other members of the gang are to maintain radio silence to enable the 
Locomotive Operator to hear the instructions.  
7.7. The protection of the Invercargill maintenance depot building was changed, with the use of the 
derailer discontinued and replaced by padlocking the points to the depot building siding.  The 
depot mechanical staff have sole control of the padlock key.  The Joint Operation Plan has 
been updated to document the new depot protection regime.  
7.8. Based on the design interference that led to the derailer being torn from its sleeper mounts by 
the locomotive cowcatcher during this incident, KiwiRail is undertaking a rev iew of the 
suitability of derailers for its current rolling stock.  
7.9. Based on the lack of formal review or auditing of the Joint Operating Plan at the Invercargill 
maintenance depot, KiwiRail's Zero Harm Assurance team ha s established a programme 
whereby the Joint Operating Plan  and associated documents, policies and procedures will be 
reviewed on a formal rolling basis to ensure they are fit for purpose and being adhered to in 
practice.  This is on top of the existing  five-year formal review of Joint Operati ng Plan s.

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   Due to the s afety actions taken by KiwiRail subsequent to this incident, no new 
recommendations have been made as a result of this inquiry . 
Recommendations  
8.2. Due to the safety actions taken by KiwiRail  subsequent to this incident, no new 
recommendations have been made as a result of this inquiry.

 Final Report RO -2017 -106 9. Key l essons  
9.1. It is important to ensure that  documented rules, policies and procedures are compatible and 
consistent across all places of work in the rail netw ork. 
9.2. A culture of non -compliance can quickly develop if staff are not prompted to follow the proper 
procedures when undertaking their duties, and do not  challenge their work colleagues if they 
observe them not following procedures.
