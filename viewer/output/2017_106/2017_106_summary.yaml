- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The pilot assumed the points to the maintenance depot were set correctly because he saw the derailer and stop-disc in place, without verifying their actual position, leading to the wrong-routing of the locomotives (4.2.8). Additionally, the maintainer did not padlock the derailer in place, despite being trained to do so, which is a human error (4.2.5).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The maintainer did not padlock the derailer as required, which is a deviation from safety procedures (4.2.5). The pilot also failed to check the points to the maintenance depot, which is not in line with the safety procedures that require checking all points for the intended movement (4.3.7, 4.3.8).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: Although the maintainer had been trained in the use of the derailer padlock, the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan did not document a requirement for the derailer to be padlocked in place, indicating a gap in training and competency regarding the importance of this safety procedure (4.2.5).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The incident indicates a lack of robust audit and compliance testing within the organization, which suggests a safety culture that did not effectively detect and address compliance issues (4.3.4, 4.4). The practice of operational staff removing and reinstating depot protection without being identified by site management also reflects on the organizational safety culture (4.3.4).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The procedures for protecting the maintenance depot from unintended rail movements did not conform with the KiwiRail rules, indicating issues with regulatory oversight and compliance (5.2).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The Joint Operating Plan did not consider using the points leading to the maintenance depot as part of the depot protection, which is a lapse in risk management and analysis (4.3.5).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The derailer was not padlocked in place, and the key was easily accessible, which indicates a lack of proper maintenance and inspection regimes to ensure that safety devices are correctly utilized and secured (4.3.3).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot did not observe the locomotives diverting towards the maintenance depot, missing the opportunity to prevent the wrong-routing, which indicates a failure in crew resource management (4.2.10).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's lack of situational awareness, by not observing the actual route of the locomotives and assuming the points were set correctly, contributed to the incident (4.2.10).
