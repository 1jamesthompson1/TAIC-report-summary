- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to safety procedures is a critical theme in this accident, as there was "poor adherence to existing safety procedures" (4.1.2). The pilot did not fully check the setting of the points to the maintenance depot, which led to the incorrect routing of the locomotives (4.3.8). This lack of adherence to procedures contributed to the accident, highlighting the importance of following established safety protocols.
- name: Audit and Compliance Testing
  explanation: The level of audit and compliance testing is another significant safety theme, as the report indicates that the "level of audit and compliance testing of the invercargill joint operating plan were not robust in detecting and addressing compliance issues in the invercargill yard" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of effective auditing allowed non-conformities and non-compliance to go unchecked, which directly contributed to the accident (4.3.12).
- name: Clarity and Availability of Procedures
  explanation: The clarity and availability of procedures are a safety theme because the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan did not have "procedures for the completion of safety-critical tasks" that were either adequate or existing (4.1.2). Additionally, the plan did not document a requirement for the derailer to be padlocked in place (4.2.5), which is a clear example of the lack of detailed procedures that could have prevented the accident.
- name: Equipment Compatibility and Design
  explanation: Equipment compatibility and design are relevant to this accident, as the derailer's design was not compatible with the cowcatcher on the lead locomotive, which resulted in the derailer being torn off before it could derail the locomotive (4.2.11). This incompatibility is a safety issue that should have been identified and addressed to ensure the derailer could perform its intended safety function.
- name: Division of Responsibilities
  explanation: The division of responsibilities between staff is a safety theme, as there was a split of responsibility that required operations staff to liaise with mechanical staff for removing maintenance depot protection (4.3.2). However, the practice of operational staff removing and reinstating depot protection was a violation of the Joint Operating Plan (4.3.4), indicating a breakdown in the understanding and execution of assigned responsibilities.
- name: Situational Awareness of Pilots
  explanation: Situational awareness of pilots is a theme because the pilot assumed the points were set correctly without verifying them, due to the presence of the derailer and stop-disc (4.2.8). This assumption and the subsequent lack of visual confirmation of the locomotives' path (4.2.10) demonstrate a lapse in situational awareness that is critical for safe rail operations.
