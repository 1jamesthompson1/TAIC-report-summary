  \  \n4.1.1.  An aerodrome controller's prime objective is  to maintain a safe flow\
  \ of air traffic within the \nvicinity of the aerodrome and to provide clearances,\
  \ instructions and information to pil ots in \norder to prevent collisions.  This\
  \ is generally achieved in standard circuit patterns by \nsequencing aircraft to\
  \ minimise speed differentials and allow pilots maximum time to identify \nand avoid\
  \ other aircraft.  \n4.1.2.  Any loss of  separation betw een aircraft is of concern,\
  \ but it is more so when ATC actions \nintended to prevent a collision are responsible\
  \ for creating the potential conflict . \n4.1.3.  The following safety issue s are\
  \ discussed : \n\u2022 the standard of team resource management  (TRM)  in the Hamilton\
  \ ATC \ntower did not match good industry practice  \n\u2022 changes in the size\
  \ and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted some \nVFR traffic congestion to prominent\
  \ points outside the zone , and likely \nincreased the risk of collision in those\
  \ areas  \n\u2022 some aerodrome controll ers are 'over -controlling ' VFR traffic\
  \ in and \naround the zone, which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies\
  \ \nand risks causing difficulties for inexperienced pilots and those for who m\
  \ \nEnglish is their second language.   \n4.1.4.  The Commission also considered\
  \ previous ly reported  airspace  incidents and  issues \nthat had been raised in\
  \  the CAA's  public consultation on a  review of the Hamilton \nairspace  for their\
  \  potential influence  on this incident .  The flight activity at Hamilton \nwas\
  \ the most intensive  in the country , with a high  number of airspace incident\
  \  \nnotifications .  It was not clear whether th e number of incidents was due\
  \ to a \ndiligent reporting culture among the flight training organisations, was\
  \ due to the \nvolume of air traffic , or reflected und erlying safety issues. \
  \  \n4.1.5.  The significant issues that ha ve been of concern to users of the Hamilton\
  \ airspace are \ndescribed in section 4.5 , along with action s that have been taken\
  \ to address them . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The controller arrived about\
  \ 30 minutes before the shift with the expectation that there would \nbe time to\
  \ discuss the assessment process with the assessor.  The assessor  arrived  five\
  \ \nminutes before the shift was due to start  and met the controller in the cab.\
  \  T he briefing was \nreduced to a short exchan ge in the cab as the controller\
  \ prepared for the handover.  The \nassessor made comments along the lines of  it\
  \ just being \" a normal day\" .  However, the other \ntwo aerodrome  controllers\
  \ in the cab were not part of this discussion, so the usual 'setting of \nthe scene'\
  \ and agreeing on team expectations were not achieved before the assessment \nbegan.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  The traffic remained moderate for the first 30 minutes,  with a constant\
  \ demand from aircraft \nwanting to enter the zone.   It then increased because\
  \ most IFR training aircraft had requested \ncircling approaches , which slowed\
  \ the circuit flow  and increased the controller's workload . \nCircuit training\
  \ was also taking place with up to four aircraft at a time.  \n4.2.3.  Soon after\
  \ accept ing the handover as aerodrome controller , there were  indicat ions that\
  \ the \ncontroller was not in total control of the situation.  The situation became\
  \ increasingly worse \nuntil the assessor relieved the controller.  The controller\
  \ had tried to accommodate all p ilot \nrequests, but in doing so had not achieved\
  \  an orderly flow , anticipated  conflict or managed  the \nnumber of aircraft\
  \ within the circuit. The controller had also been unable to keep  the flight \n\
  strips current  to reflect traffic in the circuits and  the instrument approach\
  \ . \n4.2.4.  The first incident began when the controller allow ed the Beechcraft\
  \  1900 to conduct a low \napproach and overshoot  in an already moderately busy\
  \ circuit . The Beechcraft  1900 pilot's  \n \nFinal Report AO -2015- 009 \n<< Page\
  \ 13 >>\n request could have been declined , which would have avo ided an unnecessary\
  \ increase  in the \ncontroller's workload  and a disruption to aircraft already\
  \ in the circuit .  The controller then \nomitted to advise two light aircraft following\
  \ the Beechcraft  1900 of the risk of wake \nturbulence.  \n4.2.5.  In the second\
  \ incident the controller issued instructions that brought the Katana and Robin\
  \ \nunnecessarily into conflict .  When the potential conflict was pointed out by\
  \ the planner, the \ncontroller reacted by issuing an instruction that further increased\
  \ the ri sk of a collision.  \n4.2.6.  In the third set of incidents the radar conflict\
  \ alert warnings were indicating that the  final \napproach area was congested.\
  \  T he controller  had approved consecutive  IFR aircraft to do \ncircling approaches\
  \ , then sequenced them too close t o each other .  The first one was circling \n\
  back to line up when the radar detected the potential conflict as the next one approached.\
  \  \n4.2.7.  An analysis of the ATC recordings revealed t he controller 's pace\
  \ of speech increas ing near to \nthe end of the assessment per iod.  The controller\
  \ also spoke more often in an effort to provide \ntraffic information to the pilots\
  \  of all the aircraft under control .  Trainee pilots had less time to \ncomprehend\
  \ and respond to the controller's instructions and others were  blocked from \n\
  transmitting.  \n4.2.8.  The fourth incident included two serious aspects.  The\
  \ first was a  loss of separation for an IFR \naeroplane under the controller's\
  \ instructions and the second was the non -standard  \ninstructions given to a VFR\
  \ student pilot who was on their  first solo  flight .  It was normal \nprotocol\
  \ at Hamilton for aerodrome controllers to provide a clear space around first solo\
  \ flights \nto allow the pilot s to concentrate on their flying.   The VFR student's\
  \ flight instructor had \nadvised the controller that this st udent was on their\
  \ first solo  flight  and the controller had \nacknowledged  this before the instructor\
  \ left the aircraft . \n4.2.9.  At this point t he assessor took over as aerodrome\
  \ controller  and cleared all aircraft from the \napproach area for the VFR student\
  \ pilot to be the first to land.  The second planner assisted \nthe assessor to\
  \ identify and resolve traffic conflicts and to re -establish an orderly flow. \
  \   \nRelated factors   \n4.2.10.  The controller had been working at the Hamilton\
  \ ATC unit for about 18 months. The controller \nhad been assessed multiple times\
  \ during the initial six -month validation training.  The most \nrecent assessment\
  \ had been the first during op erational duty at six months' experienc e, and \n\
  the assessment  on this day was  the second .  The controller had worked the afternoon\
  \ shift on \nthe day before without incident . The controller's actions on this\
  \ day were uncharacteristic.  \n4.2.11.  The weather conditions on the day were\
  \ fi ne, clear  and not a factor in this incident.  The \namount of traffic was\
  \ not out of the ordinary for Hamilton, nor was it unmanageable.  The \ncontroller\
  \ had managed situations like this safely before.  Shortly after the controller\
  \ was \nrelieved, the unit manager was c onfident that the less experienced second\
  \ planner could take \nover as a solo watch until a relief could be arranged . The\
  \ air traffic movement frequency \nremained  similar to that during the incident.\
  \  \n4.2.12.  The Monday and Tuesday before the incidents had been schedu led days\
  \ off for the controller , \nthen the controller  worked the Wednesday afternoon\
  \ shift.  The controller had received private \nflying lessons on Monday, Tuesday\
  \ and Wednesday morning.  The controller later admitted not \nfeeling the best at\
  \ the start of  the Thursday shift , but had felt well enough to not call in sick.\
  \ \nFor these reasons,  fatigue and illness were discounted as factors.  \n4.2.13.\
  \  However, t he controller was nervous about the assessment  and wanted  time to\
  \ discuss this \nwith the assessor before the assessment began .  When th e pre\
  \ -briefing was replaced with a \nshort exchange in the cab , the controller was\
  \ concerned .  The controller was anxious to \ndemonstrate proficiency.  The issue\
  \ of how the assessment was performed is discussed in  the \nfollowing sections.\
  \  \n4.2.14.  It was evident from the four incidents noted in this report  and the\
  \ written comments from the \nassessor that the controller was reacting to pilot\
  \ requests rather than being in control of \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report AO -2015-\
  \ 009 managing the traffic flow and the team.  The rapid issuing of traffic information\
  \ and increased \nrate of speech late in the assessment were both indicators that\
  \ the controller was feeling \nunder pressure  (EATCHIP, 1997, p. 31) . \n4.2.15.\
  \  The Commission engaged a clinical psy chologist16 to assist at interviews of\
  \ key participants \nand to analyse the controller's actions from a psychological\
  \ perspective.  The psychologist's \nassessment of the controller's actions stated,\
  \ in part:  \nThe controller appears to have experienced 'choking  under pressure',\
  \ a \nphenomen on defined as \"a critical deterioration in the execution of habitual\
  \ \nprocesses as a result of elevation in anxiety under perceived pressure, leading\
  \ to \nsubstandard performance\" (Mesagno, Harvey, & Janelle, 2012) .  The effect\
  \ is \ncommonly observed in athletes and students and characterised by levels of\
  \ \nperformance which are below those that would normally be expected.  While \n\
  such an event may be embarrassing rather than life -threatening in a sporting \n\
  event, its occurrence in an aviation context represents a potential risk to safety.\
  \ \n4.2.16.  For a number of reasons, the controller did not achieve  their  normal\
  \ standard of proficiency  on \nthat day .  However, one person's actions or inactions\
  \ should not result in accidents or \nincidents  if other preventive measures are\
  \ in place .  Properly followed policies  and procedures \nand, above all else,\
  \ teamwork should prevent an accident or incident occurring.  The following \nsections\
  \ discuss other  safety issues with the wider system in which the controller was\
  \ working.  \nFinding  \n1. The series of incidents occurred because the controller\
  \ became overwhelmed by the \ncircumstances on the day then lost situational awareness\
  \ of the aircraft within the control  \nzone .  \n \n4.3. The air traffic control\
  \ assessment process  \nProficiency expectations  \n4.3.1.  The ATC assessment \
  \ process includes 10 competencies that a n aerodrome  controller  must \ndemonstrate.\
  \ The top three core competencies are: apply situational awareness; manage the \n\
  traffic situatio n to achieve an orderly flow; and critically analyse traffic for\
  \ potential conflict \nand apply timely resolutions.  These core competencies provide\
  \ the foundation skills that an \naerodrome  controller needs  to manage air traffic\
  \  safely .  \n4.3.2.  An aerodrome controller  develops their primary situational\
  \ awareness by looking for aircraft \nout of a window and listening to local radio\
  \ frequencies.  Their main tool is t he flight progress \nboard with which they\
  \ track aircraft through sectors and stages of arrival and  departure.  They \n\
  can also use  the surveillance radar to confirm the identity of a distant visual\
  \ contact and to \ncheck on aircraft position s. \n4.3.3.  An aerodrome controller\
  \  also manage s the operational team's workload.   That is, they manage \ntheir\
  \ own performance and any interpersonal factors that might prevent the team performing\
  \ \nin a supportive manner.  In the broader sense, this means the aerodrome controller\
  \  must be \naware of each individual's workload and set the pace of traffic flow\
  \ to match the team \ncapacity.   \n                                           \
  \             \n \n \n16 Keith McGr egor, Personal Psychology NZ Ltd, Lower Hutt\
  \  \n \nFinal Report AO -2015- 009 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.3.4.  By the time a n aerodrome\
  \  controller has gained their licence, they will have progressed \nthrough a rigorous\
  \ training system with regular progress assessments and tests followed by a \nperiod\
  \ of on -the-job instruction.  After further check observations and simulated assessments,\
  \  \nthey are assessed for their licence.   By the time they are licensed , validated\
  \ and operational at  \nan active  ATC unit, they are considered to  be acting competently\
  \ and responsibly.  \n4.3.5.  Consequently, a  proficiency assessment  would normally\
  \ be  a routine process resulting in \nminor changes to improve  their  technique\
  \ .  It would therefore be unusual for an assessment \nto be terminated for operational\
  \ reasons . \n4.3.6.  Individual aerodrome controllers  may react differe ntly to\
  \ the same stimulus.  In order to \nconduct a fair assessment of proficiency, the\
  \ assessment process must not impose an \nartificial pressure on the person being\
  \ assessed  or the operational team.   The CAA Advisor y \nCircular AC65 -9 contains\
  \ a checklist of items against which an instructor is assessed to \nbecome an assessor.\
  \  The list covers for example, the instructor's ability : to conduct a pre -\n\
  assessment briefing17 with the person to be assessed  in an appropriate env ironment;\
  \ to \nreduce stress the person being assessed  may be feeling; and to advise others\
  \ who may be \naffected by the assessment that it is going to take place, including\
  \ any special requirements \nthe assessor may have for them.  \nThis assessment\
  \  \n4.3.7.  Due to the assessor 's time of arrival, the standard pre -assessment\
  \ briefing  was replaced by  a \nbrief conversation in  the cab , then  the assessment\
  \ started with the handover of ATC to the \ncontroller . The assessor did not  conduct\
  \ the required key de -stressing actions before the \nassessment  began  or determine\
  \ whether the controller was ready  to be assessed .  \n4.3.8.  The assessor noticed\
  \ a degree of tension in the cab upon arrival .  The assessor attributed the \n\
  tension to something between the three aerodrome controllers.  The oth er two aerodrome\
  \ \ncontrollers  in the cab were unaware until then that an assessment was to be\
  \ performed.  In \nthe absence of a formal briefing, the others were left to assume\
  \ what the assessor expected \nof them  during the assessment .  \n4.3.9.  The assessor\
  \ became  increasingly uncomfortable with the controller's performance during the\
  \ \nassessment , particularly the management of potential traffic conflicts .  The\
  \ assessor had been \ninvolved with the controller's training at the Hamilton ATC\
  \ unit and was familiar with t he \ncontroller's style.   It was clear to the assessor\
  \ that the controller was not operating normally or \nto the required standard,\
  \ but the assessor was unsure if the assessment could be terminate d \nearly.  \
  \ The assessor  intended to discuss  this with the unit m anager at  the next schedul\
  \ ed \nbreak.  \n4.3.10.  According to a  senior Airways ATC examiner at the air\
  \ traffic controller training centre , if a \nperson being assessed does not meet\
  \ any one of the 10 competencies, they are not \ncompetent to remain in control\
  \ and the assessment should be terminated.   The examiner also \nsaid that an  assessor\
  \ should not let a situation develop to an extent that an incident occurs  \nbut\
  \ acknowledged that it \" was a subjective judgement call \".  The examiner further\
  \ explained \nthat \" the aerodrom e environment is particularly tricky as things\
  \ happen so much more quickly \nand aeroplanes are much closer to each other \"\
  .  \n4.3.11.  Based on these comments from the examiner , it would have been good\
  \ practice  to stop the \nassessment or withdraw the controller from th eir active\
  \ position within the first 30 minutes . \nOther qualified aerodrome controllers\
  \ were present at the time to take over .  The unit manager \ncould also have been\
  \ signalled to go to the cab if required . \n                                  \
  \                      \n \n \n17 The assessment briefing is outlined in Appendix\
  \ C of AC65 -9 and the guidance provided in  the \nInternational Civil Aviation\
  \ Organization's Air Traffic Services Planning Manual (Doc 9426 -AN/924)   \n\n\
  << Page 16 >>\n Final Report AO -2015- 009 4.3.12.  Airways submitted that it  \"\
  will undertake a review of the assessment procedure to determine \nany further improvements\
  \ across Airways on how assessment should be carried out, including \nsteps to support\
  \ staff to make better judgement calls in such assessment situations \". \n4.3.13.\
  \  The circumstan ces of the assessment appear to have affected the team  dynamics\
  \  in the cab ; \nthis is addressed in the following section.   \n4.4. Team resource\
  \ management  \nSafety issue : The standard of team resource management in the Hamilton\
  \ ATC tower did not match \ngood industry p ractice .  \nOperational team work \
  \ \n4.4.1.  Airways say s that it operates with a 'just culture' in which  people\
  \ are encouraged to provide \nessential safety -related information. A just culture\
  \ is defined as:  \nOne where front line operators are not punished for actions,\
  \ omissions or \ndecisions taken by them which are commensurate with their experience\
  \ and \ntraining but where gross negligence, wilful violations and destructive acts\
  \ are not \ntolerated (EUROCONTROL, 2018) .  \n4.4.2.  The European Air Traffic\
  \ Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme18 has been co -\nordinating ATC\
  \ standards across Europe  for more than 20  years and has an extensive library\
  \ \non related human factors19. In 2009, EUROCONTR OL identified that teamwork was\
  \ one of the \ntop 10 priority areas for ATC that needed further work if it was\
  \  going to improve on the current \nlevel of safety.   It produced a guideline\
  \ for good TRM in ATC  (EUROCONTROL, 2015) .  The \nInternational Civil Aviation\
  \ Organization ( ICAO ) introduced a n associated framework , called \n'Threat and\
  \ Error Management' (ICAO, 2008) , to help ATC managers understand and manage \n\
  system and human performance in operational conte xts to enhance aviation safety.\
  \  \n4.4.3.  The aim of  TRM  is to provide a strategy for air navigation service\
  \ providers , such as Airways, to \nmake the best use of all available resources\
  \ (information, equipment and people) to optimise \nthe safety and efficiency of\
  \ air traffic services  (EUROCONTROL, 2007) .  In such an \nenvironment, a member\
  \ of an operational team should feel free to raise a safety concern with \nanother\
  \ member of the team during a situation  and that person should be able to accept\
  \ and \nuse that feedback to improve the team performance.   To be effective, the\
  \ team must also \nhave a clear vision of what behaviour is preferred and what is\
  \ unacceptable in terms of their \nprofessional responsibilities  and standards\
  \ .  The team members must also understand and \nput into practice the human factors\
  \ concepts that contribute to an efficient team  and \nteamwork . \n4.4.4.  Airways\
  \ trains aerodrome controllers to be competent in solo -watch position s.  Teamwork,\
  \ \ninterpersonal communication and other teamwork -related human factors are covered\
  \ in the \nbasic ATC course , then again through the aerodrome controller course\
  \  in Christchurch .  During \nthe on -the-job instruction phase in Palmerston North,\
  \ they learn to task share with planner s, \nbut this is specific to Pa lmerston\
  \ North.  During the validation training at Hamilton they are \ntaught the specific\
  \ task -sharing for that ATC unit.  However, task -sharing is not the same as \n\
  TRM or teamwork.  \n4.4.5.  The aerodrome controller  is in charge of the operational\
  \ team, which includ es a planner for \ndual watch periods and may include a flight\
  \ data assistant.   Both aerodrome controllers  are \n                         \
  \                               \n \n \n18 This was one o f the initiatives launched\
  \ in 1990 by the member states of the European Union to create a \nseamless European\
  \ ATC system.  \n19 Human factors is the application of psychological and physiological\
  \ principles to the (engineering and) \ndesign of products, processes,  and systems.\
  \ The goal of human factors is to reduce human error, increase \nproductivity, and\
  \ enhance safety and comfort with a specific focus on the interaction between the\
  \ human \nand the thing of interest.  \n \nFinal Report AO -2015- 009 \n<< Page\
  \ 17 >>\n qualified in each role and they usually swap roles during a shift.   Although\
  \ an assessor was \npresent for this incident, the assessor is not normally part\
  \ of the operational team.  However, \nin an emergency the assessor is able to perform\
  \ the aerodrome controller  or planner role and \nis a resource available to the\
  \ operationa l team.  The assessor's presence can also ha ve an \neffect on the\
  \ operational team dynamics.   \n4.4.6.  Airways had developed a training course\
  \ to improve teamwork and raise the professional \nstandards of controllers , but\
  \ at the time of this incident none of the Hamilt on controllers had \ncompleted\
  \ the course . \nTeam  resource management  in the cab  \n4.4.7.  Both planners\
  \ were familiar with the controller's style and recognised that the controller was\
  \ \nnot performing well  at the time.  The second planner was of the view that it\
  \ was the  \ncontroller's licence at sta ke and did not see that as a shared responsibility\
  \ .  The assessor had \nnot clarified with the two planners what was expected of\
  \ them during the assessment .  \n4.4.8.  There were some elements of co -operation\
  \ and some advice given to the controller , but overall \nthe circuit patterns were\
  \ regularly overloaded , which indicated that  the team had not \nmanage d the traffic\
  \ flow  well .  \n4.4.9.  At one point while on  a rest break at the rear of the\
  \ cab , the second planner observed  the \nemerging situation that resulted in the\
  \ second incident.  The second planner voiced their  \nconcern to  both  the first\
  \ planner and the assessor.   The first planner relayed th at concern to  \nthe\
  \ controller .  The controller then attempted to resolve the conflict  but was not\
  \ successful in \ndoing so .  \n4.4.10.  The second planner  said later that both\
  \ planners had suggested to the controller at different \ntimes that they land some\
  \ of the aeroplanes on circuit training  to ease the workload , but that \ndid not\
  \ happen .  Landing some of the c ircuiting aircraft was  a standard tool used by\
  \ \naerodrome controllers at Hamilton to relieve traffic congestion.   The planner\
  \ organise d aircraft \nwaiting to enter the zone so was  usually more in touch\
  \ than the aerodrome controller with the \nimmediate future traffic demand and able\
  \ to advise the controller  if a peak was due.  \n4.4.11.  When the assessor eventually\
  \ took control , the team dynamics suddenly changed .  The \nsecond planner immediately\
  \ became more co-operative and took proactive steps to assist the \nassessor to\
  \  reduce congestion in the zone.   There could have been several reasons for this\
  \ \nchange , such as the assessment having been terminated or the immediate risk\
  \ of further \nincidents.  However , it also emphasised how the team had not worked\
  \ during the assessment.  \n4.4.12.  The incident highlighted the importance of\
  \ working together as a team.  It also emphasised \nthe importance of setting the\
  \ scene for the team before an assessment.  Normally, regardless \nof who is in\
  \ control, it would be a team responsibility to manage traffi c in a zone.  This\
  \ should \nnot change when an assessment is being conducted.   Although an assessment\
  \ may be \nfocused on an individual's proficiency, it should also include the proficiency\
  \ of other members \nof that  team in support ing the team objectives.  \nTeam dynamics\
  \  at the  Hamilton ATC  unit \n4.4.13.  A well performing team needs to put personal\
  \ differences aside and work together.  However, \nsome of the interpersonal dynamics\
  \ at the ATC unit were likely to have influenced the \noperational team's performance\
  \ on this day.  \n4.4.14.  The unit manager had been in  the role  for just over\
  \ three years at the time  of these incidents \nand had  previous management training\
  \ and experience  as a manager  with Airways and other \nemployers.  The unit manager\
  \  said that Airways had provided  management s upport and \nguidance  in the current\
  \ role .  The unit manager was responsible for all activities within the ATC \n\
  unit, including operational standards,  training , recruiting and maintaining the\
  \ unit's business \nrelationships with other users and customers.  The unit manager\
  \ had attempted \nunsuccessfully to resolve personality conflicts between several\
  \ aerodrome controllers .  The \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report AO -2015- 009 last\
  \ measure  was to separate those aerodrome  controllers to some extent with roster\
  \ \nadjustments.  \n4.4.15.  Hamilton employ ed only qualified aer odrome controllers\
  \ , and most were recently licensed \nthrough the Airways ATC training system .\
  \  During an aerodrome controller's last stage of \ntraining at the Palmerston North\
  \ ATC unit, the unit manager there spent  a lot of time in the \ncab working with\
  \ the t rainees and offering mentoring advice and guidance.   The Hamilton ATC \n\
  unit manager was unable to provide this level of support in the cab , and relied\
  \ on other \nmethods of feedback to check on service delivery and team performance.\
  \  \n4.4.16.  The unit manager  had attempted to roster more experienced aerodrome\
  \ controllers to work \nalongside the new ones as unofficial mentors , but it had\
  \ not always  been  possible  with a high \nproportion of inexperienced  aerodrome\
  \  controllers working in the Hamilton ATC unit, nor had  it \nbeen effective .\
  \  For example, i n one situation, well  intended mentoring advice had led to \n\
  conflict .  \n4.4.17.  The Commission was informed repeatedly that the Hamilton\
  \ ATC unit was an undesirable \nplace for  aerodrome  controllers to work . This\
  \  was claimed to be mainl y associated with the \nheavy workload  at Hamilton compared\
  \ to other locations where aerodrome controllers had  the \nsame employment conditions\
  \ .  Consequently, staff  turnover  was high and tenure was short at \nHamilton\
  \ . Replacements proved difficult  to engag e and, overall, the workload had a \n\
  detrimental effect on staff.   The main source of replacements was the Airways training\
  \ centre , \nwhere graduates had little  choice for their first post ing.   \n4.4.18.\
  \  This default  influx of recent graduate s lower ed the average experience level\
  \ of aerodrome \ncontrollers at Hamilton.   Once qualified, a n aerodrome  controller\
  \ gains experience in the role \nbut will take time to develop judgement to handle\
  \ situations that are different from their \ntraining environments.   It was  difficult\
  \  for the unit manager to manage this risk when there \nwere  only eight aerodrome\
  \ controllers in the establishment and more than 50% had less than \ntwo years'\
  \ experience as licen sed aerodrome controller s.  The unit manager had employed\
  \ \naerodrome controllers fr om overseas at times in order to meet the unit's  minimum\
  \ -experience \ntarget.  \n4.4.19.  The aerodrome operator20 was concerned about\
  \ the relative inexperience of aerodrome \ncontrollers and their high turnover rate.\
  \ It  had recommended in its  aeronautical study in 2012  \n(refer to section 4.5.5\
  \ ) that Airways \"consider options associated with ensuring aerodrome \ncontroller\
  \ turnover is minimised \".  CTC Aviation Training (NZ) Limited ( CTC) , the major\
  \ flight \ntraining operator at Hamilton, had raised the risk rating for its  Hamilton\
  \ operations in \nDecember 2017 as a consequence of its concern about the average\
  \ experience of the \naerodrome controllers.  \n4.4.20.  The potential risk presented\
  \ by the la ck of experienced aerodrome controllers at Hamilton and \nthe predominance\
  \ of recent graduates appears to have reduced with the introduction of a \nmentoring\
  \ role.   This risk is well known and a focus point within the aerodrome safety\
  \ system.  \nAirways submitted that the relevant practices at the Hamilton unit\
  \ did not differ because of  the \nlevel of aerodrome controller experience.   However,\
  \ others operating at the aerodrome \ndisagreed .  As the existing aerodrome safety\
  \ systems have been further developed , this issue \ncan be managed at a local level.\
  \  For th is reason , a safety recommendation has not been \nissued  to Airways\
  \ .  \n4.4.21.  Actions taken by Airways , including an organisation al restructure\
  \ and training provided to the \nunit manager and aerodrome contro llers, is expected\
  \ to improve teamwork and free up some \nof the unit manager's time to raise service\
  \ delivery standards.  This has alleviated the need for \na safety recommendation\
  \  to Airways in relation to teamwork . \n                                     \

  \ AO -2015- 009 \n<< Page 19 >>\n Findings  \n2. The assessment that was being conducted\
  \ of the controller affected the normal team \ndynamics in the control tower , partly\
  \ because a standard pre -assessment briefing was not \nconducted  and the expectations\
  \ of the team during the assessment were not explained . \n3. During the assessment\
  \ there  was a breakdown in the team approach to managing the \ntraffic in the aerodrome\
  \ circuit, which was a significant factor contributing to th is series of \nincidents\
  \ .  \n4. Airways ' practice of posting a high proportion of recently qualified\
  \ aerodrome controllers \nwith limited experience to Hamilton aerodrome, one of\
  \ the busiest in the country, had the \npotential to raise  the risk profile of\
  \ the ATC unit . \n4.5. The wider safety issues for Hamilton aerodrome  \n4.5.1.\
  \  Participants in the aviation system are required by Civil Aviation Rules Part\
  \ 12 , Accidents, \nIncidents, and Statistics,  to notify the CAA of accidents and\
  \ certain incidents.  They are also \nrequired to investigate incidents that they\
  \ notif y and to provide the CAA with the results of \nthose investigations.  Hamilton\
  \ aerodrome  had a high rate of  incident notifications to the CAA.  \nThe CAA 's\
  \ involvement  with the aerodrome safety system had been  largely confined to \n\
  monitoring events, until it was  prompted to examine the aerodrome safety system\
  \ after a \nnear -collision i n 2013.  \n4.5.2.  The Commission had also been  monitoring\
  \ the incidence of airspace notifications at Hamilton .  \nThis inquiry provided\
  \ an opportunity for the Commission to examine  the underlying  issues in  \nthe\
  \ wider aerodrome safety system.  The more significant safety issues that were \
  \ of concern \nto participants at Hamilton aerodrome are described below . \nThe\
  \ aerodrome safety system  was ine ffective  \n4.5.3.  In 2005  CTC started up operations\
  \ at Hamilton aerodrome .  The high number of trainee pilots \ngreatly increased\
  \ the workload for aerodrome controllers. During 2015 CTC had about 15 \naircraft\
  \ in the air during the peak training period each day, with several in the circuit\
  \ at any \ntime.  \n4.5.4.  The CAA encourages t he creation of u ser groups  to\
  \ improve safety at aerodromes where there \nare multiple users , often  with different\
  \ airspace requirements.  Airways took the lead in setting \nup a user group at\
  \ Hamilton  and ran it until the aerodrome operator took over . \n4.5.5.  In 2011\
  \ , as a result of a safety concern , the CAA require d the aerodrome  operator\
  \ to conduct \nan aeronautical study21 under C ivil Aviation Rules Part 139, Aerodrome\
  \ -  Certification, \nOperation and Use .  The study wa s intended to review the\
  \ aerodrome and operations  to \nensure that appropriate  safety criteria were in\
  \ place .  The aerodrome  operator provided the \naeronautical study report to the\
  \ CAA in May 2012.  \n4.5.6.  The CAA used the incident data notified by aerodrome\
  \ participants in accordance with Civil \nAviation Rules Part 12  to prepare  statistical\
  \ safety performance data for each  aerodrome .  An \naerodrome operator needed\
  \ to know the relevant data and analyses in order to fulfil its \nresponsibilities\
  \ in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules Part 139.  Until 2014 the CAA had not\
  \ \nprovided aerodrome operators with this data .  The Hamilton aerodrome operator\
  \ had obta ined \n                                                        \n \n\
  \ \n21 An aeronauti cal study is defined in CAA Advisory Circular  AC139- 15. \n\
  \n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report AO -2015- 009 copies of th e information from Airways\
  \ .  The  CAA now sends monthly incident data report s to \nall Part 139 aerodrome\
  \ operators.  \n4.5.7.  In January 2013 the CAA investigated a near -collision \
  \ at Hamilton , which led to an \ninvestigation of wider issues related to the airspace\
  \ incidents22.  The safety investigation \nrevealed a strained relationship between\
  \ Airways and CTC  and a failure by participants to \nidentify the root causes \
  \ of th e incidents .  The CAA assisted the parties to resolve these issues \nand\
  \ in May 2013 conducted a two -day workshop at Hamilton with all users.   The parties\
  \ \nchanged their behaviour  and by the end of th at year the aerodrome  operator\
  \ had taken over \nits responsibility under Part 139 to lead the aerodrome  safety\
  \ system .  \n4.5.8.  The previous  user group was  disbanded and replaced with\
  \ a structured governance group with  \nsub-committees for aerodrome  management,\
  \  safety and operations . Meetings were held \nregular ly, and minutes  produced\
  \ with action items to complete for the next meeting.  Airways \nand CTC rebuilt\
  \  their damaged relationship and  were  foster ing their future co -operation .\
  \ \n4.5.9.  By 2017 aerodrome users were report ing that the aerodrome operator's\
  \ safety management \nsystem was an effective platform for resolving local safety\
  \ issues.  \nThe zone was too large and boundaries not clearly defined  \nSafety\
  \ issue - Changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted s ome\
  \ VFR traffic \ncongestion to prominent points outside the zone , and likely increased\
  \ the risk of collision in those \nareas . \n4.5.10.  The zone covered the aerodrome\
  \  and the instrument approach paths to  the north  and south .  \nVFR entry and\
  \ exit sectors were located on  the e astern and w estern sides.  It was  classified\
  \ as  \nClass D airspace , which required  ATC to provide separation between IFR\
  \ traffic and between \nIFR and special VFR traffic. VFR traffic was responsible\
  \ for its own separation.  \n4.5.11.  The size of the zone was claimed by some users\
  \ as  too large , because it resulted in one \naerodrome controller  having too\
  \ many aircraft to manage .  Another concern was that  the \nboundary of the zone\
  \ was  difficult to identify from the air .  There w as also criticism that  the\
  \ \nHamilton zone was depicted across  the edges  of adjacent navigation  charts\
  \ , which was a  \nchalleng e for novice pilots  as they swapped between charts\
  \ in busy airspace.  \n4.5.12.  The CAA conducted a review and public consultation\
  \ as part of its continuing airspace review \nconducted under Civil Aviation Rules\
  \ Part 71 , Design and Classification of Airspace .  In late \n2016  the zone was\
  \ redesigned and reduced in size .  The chart issue was still being \nconsidered\
  \ . \n4.5.13.  After these changes were promulgated, the rate of airspace occurrences\
  \ started to decrease. \nData for the 12 months following  the airspace changes\
  \ show ed a significant and sustained \ndrop in airspace occurrences at Hamilton.\
  \ \n4.5.14.  However, the changes had the effect of shifting congestion to uncontrolled\
  \ airspace , and \nsome features of the proposed circular flow in the circuit were\
  \ not implemented.  The crucial \nbenefit that the CAA expected from the airspace\
  \ changes was a more efficient circuit traffic \nflow, but this has not been achieved.\
  \  According to CTC, d epartures ha d improved , but arrivals \nare still directed\
  \ to join at the start of the downwind leg or late downwind , only to  be extended\
  \ \nfurther downwind.  This has led  to a concentration  of VFR aircraft just outside\
  \ the zone near  \neasily recognisable landmarks , and has likely increased the\
  \ risk of a collision near those \npoints . \n                                 \

  \  Consequently, t he airspace design around Hamilton and the traffic density have\
  \ created a \nhazard  in uncontrolled airspace.   The VFR arrival procedures described\
  \ in the Aeronautical \nInformation Publication  (AIP NZ)23 draw pilots to a reporting\
  \ area within a 300 -foot (91 -metre) \nheight band adjacent to the lower limit\
  \ of the 2, 000-foot  (609 -metre) control area above the \naerodrome.   This height\
  \ band is further limited if a pilot wishes to stay clear of the overhead \ncontrol\
  \ area with a self -imposed safety buffer.  Multiple VFR aircraft could be holding\
  \ in this \nnarrow band , with the pilots keeping a look out for other aircraft.\
  \  \n4.5.16.  There is no guidance for VFR pilots on  a safe approach procedure\
  \ to the zone while awaiting \nclearance to enter.  Nothing is mentioned in the\
  \ VFR arrival charts or documented in the \nHamilton control tower Local Unit Orders\
  \  for aerodrome controllers  to manage pote ntial \nqueues of aircraft hold ing\
  \ outside the zone .  Local users ha ve asked the CAA to produce a \n'Good Aviation\
  \ Practice ' booklet for the Hamilton area,  but one has not  yet been written .\
  \  Local \nusers mitigate this congestion through  their own operational pr ocedures,\
  \ but itinerant  users of \nthe aerodrome are unlikely to be aware of them and are\
  \ not bound by them .  \n4.5.17.  The airspace changes have reduced the rate of\
  \ incident reports in the zone , but it is apparent \nfrom user feedback obtained\
  \ in late 2017 for this investigation that not all issues have been \nresolved and\
  \ that the CAA needs to remain actively involved  with the aerodrome safety groups\
  \ .  \nA safety recommendation to the CAA has been made to this effect.  \nATC over\
  \ -controlling  and excessive traffic information  \nSafety issue - Some aerodrome\
  \ controllers are 'over -controlling ' VFR traffic in and around the zone, \nwhich\
  \ is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies and risks causing difficulties\
  \ for inexperienc ed \npilots and those for who m English is their second language.\
  \  \n4.5.18.  During 2010 a CAA audit of the Hamilton ATC unit found that it was\
  \ providing separation \nbetween  VFR aircraft inside the Class D airspace zone.\
  \  This was  not part of the required \nservice for C lass D airspace and it created\
  \ the possibility for pilots to misinterpret  what to \nexpect from ATC .  Users\
  \ also claimed  that ATC was often over -controlling.   \n4.5.19.  Over -controlling\
  \ was also found to be occurring by the CAA investigation in 2013 , which also \n\
  noted incidents of non -standard phraseology, overly long communications and ambiguous\
  \ \nmessages . The audio records reviewed during th is series of incidents in 2015\
  \ identified that \nthe aerodrome controllers were passing excessive traffic information\
  \ to  aeroplanes when  \nthere was no  need .  CTC continue d to raise similar concerns\
  \ about over -controlling in 2017 \nthrough the aerodrome safety system , and emphasise\
  \ d that protracted traffic information was  \na challenge for most trainees, including\
  \ those with English as their  first language .  \n4.5.20.  The majority of air\
  \ traffic in the  Hamilton zone is VFR , for which  ATC does not provide \nseparation\
  \ .  ATC is required to provide information or instructions to pilots within the\
  \ zone \nwhen necessary , to help them to avoid collisions  and to create a patterned\
  \ and sequenced \nflow.  Many of the aircraft in the Hamilton circuit patterns would\
  \ be irrelevant to a pilot about \nto join downwind for the left -hand circuit ,\
  \ when that pilot would just expect a sequence and to \nbe able to identify the\
  \ aerop lane ahead.  \n4.5.21.  The guidance provided in AIP NZ Gen 3.3 .1324 states\
  \ that traffic information is issued \" to alert \na pilot to other known or observed\
  \ air traffic that may be in proximity to the position or \nintended route of flight\
  \ and to help the pilot avoid a collision \". This is the same as the \ndefinition\
  \ for traffic information in Airways ' Manual of Air Traffic Services.  \n     \
  \                                                   \n \n \n23 AIPNZ AD 2 -  pages\
  \ 35.4 and 35.5.  \n24 Aeronautical Information Publication (AIPNZ), published by\
  \ the CAA.  \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report AO -2015- 009 4.5.22.  However, t he\
  \ text within Airways ' Manual of Air Traffic Services  has a broader interpretation\
  \  for \nwhen ATC is required to provide information .  It states25 that pilots\
  \ shall be advised of \"traffic \noperating in the 'vicinity of the aerodrome '\
  \ that may constitute a hazard to the aircraft \nconcerned \" and leaves it to the\
  \ judgement of the aerodrome controller  to determine when it is \nnecessary in\
  \ the interests of safety.  The ' vicinity ' of the aerodrome includes all aircraft\
  \ within \nthe circuit patterns and the zone.    \n4.5.23.  The CAA investigation\
  \ in 2013 found several anomalies between the interpretation of written \nprocedures\
  \ and  the requirements for A TC services in documents produced by the CAA, Airways\
  \ \nand ICAO. It also found that Airways ' Local Unit Orders for the Hamilton ATC\
  \ unit were the \nresponsibility of the unit manager , which opened the possibility\
  \ of different interpretations for \nthe same airs pace category around the country.\
  \  \n4.5.24.  As the issue of aerodrome controllers over -controlling and passing\
  \ excessive information is \nstill evident at Hamilton, the cause seems to be embedded\
  \ in the ATC training system and the \npredominance of inexperienced aerodr ome\
  \ controllers  at the Hamilton ATC unit, as referred to \nin previous sections.\
  \   A safety recommendation has been made to Airways to address this \nissue.  \n\
  Language barriers  \n4.5.25.  Most of the pilot trainees at Hamilton come from outside\
  \ New Zealand , and for many English \nis not their first language.  They have to\
  \ be able to communicate in English before they can \nstart training , but accents\
  \ remain strong. This can hinder communication with ATC and \nhighlights the importance\
  \ of standard phraseology  and pace of deliver y.  \n4.5.26.  Language was a concern\
  \ to Airways , but CTC considered that a  greater risk  was to ignore  the \ncultural\
  \ differences . Some cultures are reluctant to express  difference s of opinion\
  \ and some \npilot trainees may attempt to comply explicitly with ATC instructio\
  \ ns.  The concern was that \nsuch obedience could expose a pilot to exceeding their\
  \ own abilities or their aircraft's \ncapa bilities if an  ATC instruction  were\
  \ impractical.  \nIFR circling procedure  \n4.5.27.  The IFR training syllabus was\
  \  required to cover the circling pro cedure after an instrument \napproach .  The\
  \ l ocal arrangement  for this procedure required an IFR pilot to become visual\
  \ \nwith the runway and conduct a right -hand circle from the threshold  of Runway\
  \ 18 at 800 feet  \n(245 metres) above  sea level .  If traffic al lowed  they would\
  \ be sequenced as number one,  but \notherwise they would be required to extend\
  \ downwind at low level away from the threshold to \njoin with  a different  sequence.\
  \  \n4.5.28.  As an exercise, this local procedure  did not instil  the correct\
  \ procedure  for circli ng because the \npilot lost sight of  the runway  and then\
  \ came back to the same vector .  More importantly, as \nseen during these incidents,\
  \ the orbit in the final approach area  created congestion and a \ncollision risk\
  \ .  \n4.5.29.  The parties involved have since agreed on a more practical and realistic\
  \ method that positions  \naircraft into the normal active circuit pattern.  \n\
  Circuit booking system  \n4.5.30.  In order to help reduce the peak  number  of\
  \ aircraft doing circuit training, a booking sys tem \nwas established  to spread\
  \ circuit use  across the day .  CTC has three ' slots ' and Waikato \nAviation\
  \  one slot .  The slots are managed online , with aircraft being booked for half-hour\
  \ slots. \nWhen th e allotted  time is up, the pilot land s or leave s the circu\
  \ it pattern.   CTC and Waikato \n                                             \
  \           \n \n \n25 Manual of Air Traffic Services  RAC 4, section 4.1.2.  \n\
  \ \nFinal Report AO -2015- 009 \n<< Page 23 >>\n Aviation may  sometimes negotiate\
  \ more slots from  each other 's allocation , but four  aircraft in \nthe circuit\
  \ at once is the maximum available .  \n4.5.31.  Airways may reduce traffic density\
  \ by instructing a pilot  on circuit training  to land for a period .  \nThis allows\
  \ the aerodrome controller to clear the traffic peaks within  the zone.  \n4.5.32.\
  \  CTC agreed to fund a flight data assistant part -time in the tower to assist\
  \ the aerodrome \ncontrollers with administration tasks and managing the circuit\
  \  booking system.   This funding \nwas increased during 2017  to employ the flight\
  \ data assistant five days per week.  \nSummary conclusions  \n4.5.33.  Hamilton\
  \ aerodrome  has had many issues over many years that have caused acrimony \nbetween\
  \ users and led to airspace incident s.  By 2017 the aerodrome operator, Airways\
  \ and \nother users ha d made significant progress  in resolving those issues and\
  \ improving aerodrome \nsafety .  Some issues still remain , but these  can be managed\
  \ through the aerodrome safety \nsystem  with assistance from  the CAA.  \n4.5.34.\
  \  CAA statistical data indicate that there has been a significant safety improvement\
  \ at Hamilton \nsince late 2016, one year after the incident that initiated this\
  \ inquiry.  This improvement  is \ncoincident with changes introduced to the Hamilton\
  \ zone by the CAA and Airways.  \nFinding s \n5. Airspace incidents  within  the\
  \ Hamilton control zone  have reduced since airspace \nchanges , but not all user\
  \ concerns have been resolved and the risk of a conflict outsi de \nthe zone has\
  \ increased  as a result . \n6. Some aerodrome controllers at Hamilton were passing\
  \ more traffic information to pilots \nthan was necessary, which instead of improving\
  \ aviation safety was creating radio \ncongestion and difficulties for pilots, particul\
  \ arly those for whom English was their second \nlanguage . \n  \n\n<< Page 24 >>"
