The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropri ate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost  of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a  standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other acci dent investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector  and the public , both domestically and international ly, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Thursday 17 December 2015, an aerodrome controller (the controller) was undergoing an 
annual proficiency assessment in the Hamilt on air traffic control tower.  A two -person w atch 
was on duty in the tower and a ir traffic in the circuit  patterns was high but normal for the peak 
period of the day.  A planner was working with the controller , and an assessor sat behind to 
observe and record the controller's actions.  
1.2. During the asse ssment , a series of four incidents occurred that related to the controller's 
management of air traffic in the vicinity of the aerodrome.  Following the fourth incident, the 
assessor stopped the assessment and took over as the aerodrome controller to resolv e the 
situation.  There were no collisions and nobody was injured.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the incidents 
occurred because the controller became overwhelmed by the circumstances on the day and 
lost situational  awareness of the aircraft within the  control  zone .   
1.4. The Commission also found  that the usual briefing procedure before  conducting the 
assessment was not  fully followed, and that this likely affected the team dynamics in the 
control tower.  
1.5. At a broader le vel the Commission found  that Airways  Corporation of New Zealand Limited's 
tradition of posting  recently  qualified controllers with limited experience to Hamilton 
aerodrome , one of the busiest in the country, had the potential to raise the risk profile of the 
air traffic control unit . 
1.6. The Commission identified the following  safety issue s: 
• the standard of team resource management in the Hamilton air traffic control tower did 
not match good  industry practice   
• some aerodrome controllers are 'over -controlling' visual flight rules traffic in and around 
the control zone, which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies and risks  
causing difficulties for inexperienced pilots and those for whom English is thei r second 
language.  
1.7. The Commission also identified the following safety issue  in relation to the wider issues for 
Hamilton aerodrome : 
• changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton control zone have shifted some visual flight 
rules traffic congestion to prom inent points outside the control zone , and likely increased 
the risk of collision in those areas.  
1.8. A number of safety actions were taken and the Commission made two recommendations  to 
address key safety issues.  
1.9. The key lessons  arising from the inquiry were : 
• operational assessments in a team situation have the potential to alter the normal team 
dynamics.  It is essential that assessments are properly managed and that every team 
member is clear on their responsibilities and their involvement in the assessment process  
• clear , succinct and short radio communication between air traffic control and aircraft is 
pivotal to safe operations .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Introduction  
3.1.1.  On Thursday 17 December  2015 , a series of air traffic control (ATC) related incidents  occurred 
at Hamilton aerodrome while it was under the control of one aerodrome controller ( the 
controller) .  The last of these incidents happened a t 1213, when two light aircraft on training 
flights at Hamilton aerodrome were directed by the controller into a head -on converging path. 
The aircraft we re a Diamond DA42 Twin  Star (Twin  Star) conducting an instrument approach 
and a Diamond DA20 Katana (Katana) flown by a pilot on their first solo flight.  
3.1.2.  The aeroplanes were both sequenced to land  on R unway 18  Left1 (Runway 18 L).  The y were 
flying on  the final leg of the circuit (Figure 2) at about two nautical miles2 (nm) from the 
runway threshold3 and about 600 feet  (183 metres)  above ground  level . 
3.1.3.  Both pilots saw the other during this loss of separation occurrence and turned away to avoid a 
collision , but the ir aircraft  came within 0.5 nm of each other.  
3.1.4.  The controller was about one hour into an annual proficiency  assessment  (assessment)  at the 
time of the occurrence .  The assessor immediately relieved the controller  from duty  and took 
over as the aerodrome controller . 
3.2. Background information  
Hamilton aerodrome traffic  
3.2.1.  Hamilton aerodrome has the highest number of air traffic movements4 operating under visual 
flight rules5 (VFR) in the country, the highest number of movements operating under 
instrument flight rules6 (IFR) for a regional aerodrome, and the second -highest total number of 
movements for any aerodrome.  The average number of movements per year in 2014 and 
2015 was 100,000 VFR movements and  30,000 IFR  movements .  For comparison , there were 
about 1 50,000 total movements each year at Auckland International Airport during the same 
period.  
3.2.2.  Most of the a ir traffic  at Hamilton comprised training flights using light aircraft .  The rest was 
made up of: regular public transport ; agricultural operations;  private aircraft; and the 
occasional military aircraft . 
3.2.3.  A pilot operating under VFR  is responsible for their separation  from other aircraft , whereas 
under IFR, ATC provide s that  separation .  
3.2.4.  The main physical difference between air traffic landing under VFR and IFR rules  at this 
aerodrome was how they join ed the circuit pattern.   A VFR aeroplane  would usually fly a box 
pattern around the runway , with the pilot maintaining visual reference to the runway.  A  
suitably qualified IFR pilot would typically  conduct a straight -in approach using instruments 
and in accordance with a published procedure.   The IFR pilot  would pass a reporting point at

6 A flight conducted in accordance with the instrument flight rules,  during which an aircraft is piloted solely by 
reference to instruments and without external reference points. Visibility may be limited due to weather or 
time of day, or be suitable for a VFR flight . 

<< Page 4 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 about 12 nm out along the extended runway centreline , where they would expect to receive 
clearance  before continuing  to land .  
3.2.5.  IFR operations were often conducted at Hamilton when the weather was also suitable for VFR 
aircraft to be operating.  The aerodrome controller had to manage the mixed flow of IFR and 
VFR aircraft  safely . 
Hamilton ATC 
3.2.6.  In 2015  the Hamilton control  zone  (zone) covered an area 20 nm long and 8 nm wide centred 
over the runway (see Appendix 1).  The controlled airspace was classified as a Class D7 zone 
that extended from ground level up to 2 ,500 feet  (760 metres)  above mean sea level .  ATC 
was responsible for providing separation between IFR aircraft within the zone.  It was also 
responsible for managing  circuit traffic and join tly responsible with pilots for avoid ing 
collisions .  ATC would achieve this by providing traffic information to conflicting aircraft or 
issuing instructions to pilots.  
3.2.7.  During peak periods, up to three staff  could be working in the cab8.  An aerodrome controller 
would be responsible for controlling  the air traffic within the zone  and could be assisted by a  
planner , who would  also be a qualified aerodrome controller .  The planner would organise  
aircraft entering  the zone in to an orderly flow .  Aerodrome controllers and planners were 
tasked with working  as a team to keep traffic flowing at a safe rate that they could  both 
manage.   A flight data assistant could also be present to  assist the aerodrome controller  with 
related administration tasks and circuit booking9 during  peak periods.   
3.2.8.  The duty rosters were arranged so that each aerodrome controller rotated through  the 
aerodrome controller  and planner roles during each shift.  The shifts overlap ped to maintain a 
two-person watch during peak hours and allow a person being relieved to take a break before 
returning for the next period .  In off-peak periods, a single aerodrome controller  was on watch . 
3.2.9.  The primary tool used to manage the traffic within the zone was t he flight progress  board.  The 
details of each aircraft were displayed on a dedicated  flight strip .  The aerodrome controller  
would move these strips around the flight progress  board to help visualise where aircraft  were 
within the zone , and annotate them with progress details.  The aerodrome controller  also had 
two surveillance radar displays that were  usually set at different ranges to help identify aircraft 
positions.   
3.2.10.  Aerodrome c ontrollers in  the cab could talk directly to each other .  The y used a telephone-type 
handset to communicate over the radio or phone  and both radio channels were connected to 
loudspeakers.   
Proficiency  assessments  
3.2.11.  Each aerodrome controller was required to undergo an annual proficiency  assessment.  They 
had to  demonstrate their competence with a standard set  of performance indicators to retain 
their operational status .

Final Report AO -2015- 009 
<< Page 5 >>
 3.2.12.  Each assessment was  conducted by an assessor. Before they start ed, the assessor  was  
required  to follow the guidance provided in CAA Advisory Cir cular  AC65 -910, which include d 
carrying out a brief ing with  the aerodrome controller undergoing assessment .  The assessor 
was also to advise any others in the cab who could be affected by the assessment  that an 
assessment was  about to take place .  The Advisory Circular further advise d that the pre-brief 
should be conducted in an appropriate environment to help alleviate any pre -assessment 
stress and to allow time for the assessor  to determine if the people involved  were  ready for 
the assessment.    
3.2.13.  The a ssessor  was  not part of the operational team on duty at the time , but had the capability 
and currency to operate in the position being assessed.  The assessment would be conducted 
over a period of at least five hours.  The assessor would sit  behind the aerodrome controller to 
listen and observe and record how that person performed .  
3.2.14.  Some discussion could occur , but generally the aerodrome controller  was encouraged to act 
as if the assessor were not present .  If the assessor needed to comment about the ae rodrome 
controller's performance or suggest improvements to meet the standard , this would  normally 
be done  during a scheduled break period.  
3.2.15.  Assessors were selected from a pool of experienced ATC instructors11, then went through 
additional training to be as sessor s12.  They follow ed written guidelines for the process and 
assess ed aerodrome controllers ' performance against a standard set of competencies.  
3.2.16.  Generally, an assessment was simply a confirmation that a n aerodrome  controller was 
performing to the standard. It rarely resulted in their  being relieved of duty for not meeting the 
standard , but if it did , a specific training plan was developed to address any concerns and 
help that person to return to active duty  as soon as possible.  
3.3. Narrative  
Before the duty shift  
3.3.1.  The Hamilton tower was in operation with a two -person watch consisting of an aerodrome 
controller  and a planner  only.  Runway s 18L and 18  Right (18 R) were  in use with a left -hand 
circuit13.  The controller was scheduled to commence the shift in  the aerodrome controller  role 
at 1110, but  arrived early to allow time to meet the assessor.   The controller waited in the cab , 
listening to the  aerodrome  controllers and gaining an appreciation of the traffic in preparation 
for the shift.  
3.3.2.  The assessor arrived  just before the controller was due to start the shift and did not conduct 
the usual briefing before an  assessment , but mentioned to the controller something to the 
effect that it would just be like " a normal day ".  The assessor was a regular staff member at 
the ATC unit , so there was no need for personal introductions.  The  other aerodrome 
controllers  said later that they had realised an assessment  was about to take place when the 
assessor arrived , but th e assessor had not discuss ed the process with them .  
                                                        
 
 
10 CAA document AC65 -9 (CAA, 2016)  describes this requirement in terms of the performance criteria for ATC 
instructors. The docume nt is an 'Advisory Circular', which describes an acceptable means of compliance with 
the rules and legislation.  
11 ATC instructors are called Instructors (OJTI), for 'on the job training instruction'. The instructors are ATCs 
with rating s to carry out on -the-job training instruction . 
12 'Assessor' is the term used in this report, but the Airways term is Instructor (CHK) for 'instructor check'. The 
instructor has a rating to carry out proficiency assessments.

3.3.3.  A normal handover took place from the previous aerodrome controller  to the controller .  The 
assessor plugged into the controller's audio to listen to  radio and telep hone conversations , 
then sat behind to observe and record the controller's performance.  
3.3.4.  Traffic was moderate , with f our aircraft already in the circuit  and one other cleared to join the 
circuit from near Cambridge.  A helicopter was operating at low level within the zone near the 
start of the downwind leg.  Four IFR aircraft were under approach control , waiting to enter the 
zone.  A Beech craft  1900 twin -engine turboprop had returned from a local VFR test flight and 
was lining up from a right -hand circuit as number two to land  (see Figure 1 for photos of the 
aircraft and Figure 2  for the circuit pattern) .   
3.3.5.  The Beech craft  1900 pilot then made a request to  make  a "low approach and overshoot  if 
available " rather than cont inue to land .  The Beechcraft  1900  has higher operating speeds 
than light aircraft and is classified as a medium -weight aircraft .  The controller approved the 
request on the condition that the Beechcraft  1900 remain in the circuit.  
3.3.6.  The controller  then issued instructions to several other VFR aircraft in the circuit to 
accommodate  the Beechcraft  1900 pilot's request .  The controller was also required under 
these circumstances to warn following light aircraft of possible wake turbulence, but did not 
do so . 
The second incident (shift  start  plus five  minutes)  
3.3.7.  One light aircraft (a Katana ) had intended to depart to the east , but  been instructed to do a 
right -hand circuit  to make space for the Beechcraft  1900.  The controller then instructed the 
Katana to orbi t at Rukuhia14 and wait for a clearance to cross the runway to the east.  The 
Katana was  then instructed to leave the zone to the east by crossing overhead the tower  at 
circuit altitude , which put it  on a conflicting path with another light aircraft in the downwind leg 
of the left -hand circuit (a Robin) .  If the  aircraft  had maintained their headings , the Katana 
would have pass ed just behind the Robin.  
3.3.8.  This potential conflict was pointed out to the controller by the planner .  The pilot of the Robin 
also ask ed the controller's intentions for the approaching Katana.  The controller then 
instructed the Robin to orbit to the right,  which instead of resolving the potential conflict 
placed the two aircraft on a potential head -on collision course .  After a comment from the 
assessor, t he controller instruct ed the Robin to "turn left now and extend downwind until 
advised" . 
The third set of incidents  (shift start plus 45 minutes)  
3.3.9.  At this stage the previous aerodrome controller  had returned from a break and take n over the 
planner position (and is hereafter referred to as the 'second planner').  The surveillance radar 
system included a 'conflict alert' system to  alert aerodrome controller s if a projected path of 
two aeroplanes  was likely to lead to a collision.  Aerodrome controllers' task was  to sequence 
aircraft in a way that avoid ed such alerts.  Two conflict alerts occurred within a few minutes of 
each other as the controller sequenced separate pairs of IFR aeroplanes  on approach .  Both  
conflicts involved  an aeroplane approaching to land and one ahead  completi ng a circling 
manoeuvre.  A description of this manoeuvre is given in section 3.6 .3. 
The fourth  incident (shift start plus 58 to 64 minutes)  
3.3.10.  The controller was dealing with eight aircraft in three circui t patterns at this time.  Four  
aeroplanes were in the left -hand circuit , with  one of the  pilots  on their first solo  flight .  Two

Final Report AO -2015- 009 
<< Page 7 >>
 other aeroplanes were in a right -hand circuit  and a further t wo IFR aeroplanes  were on  an 
instrument approach .  A further 10 aircraft were holding outside the zone awaiting clearance 
to enter.  
3.3.11.  A Twin Star had been approved to land on Runway 18L and was turning right on  to final  after 
completing a circl ing manoeuvre .  A Katana flown by a pilot on  their first solo flight was 
estab lished on final at the same height as the Twin Star , sequenced to land behind it .  The 
controller then instructed the Twin Star  to extend downwind, which required it to  turn left , back  
towards the approaching Katana. Soon after wards the controller  had a chang e of mind and 
instructed the Twin Star  to continue with the right -hand orbit , then immediately instructed the 
Katana to orbit left  to avoid the Twin Star .  These two aircraft came within 0.5 nm of each 
other  on a near  head -on converging path .  At this  point t he assessor took control  and assumed 
the p osition of aerodrome controller . 
Resolution  
3.3.12.  The assessor and second planner worked together to resolve the conflicts  and called the unit 
manager to the cab to take over .  Soon after taking over, the unit ma nager was satisfied that 
the second planner could manage the traffic  alone , so the unit manager merged both 
positions and handed the solo  watch to the second planner until further relief could be 
arranged.  
3.3.13.  After discussing what had happened during the assessment , the unit manager  stood down the 
assessor and the controller . 
3.3.14.  Airways' policy does not require p ost-incident drug and alcohol testing for minor incident s.  
These incidents were initially classified as minor , so the controller and assessor were r eleased 
without being  tested.  Upon receipt of further information later in the day, the main incident 
was upgraded to major.  
3.4. Personnel information  
The controller  
3.4.1.  The controller  had gained high pass marks on all subjects at the Airways air traffic controller 
training centre in Christchurch . The basic training lasted  nine months  then the trainee 
controller  was posted to an operational training hub at Palmerston North for consolidat ion 
training and practical experience.     
3.4.2.  The Palmerston North ATC unit ha d a similar traffic composition as Hamilton but with fewer  
movements per year.  Trainees were first introduced to task -sharing and teamwork for the two -
person watch during their consolidation training.   The controller met the pr oficiency  standard 
to be licensed as an aerodrome controller , but had to remain a trainee until the minimum age 
of 21.   After gaining an ATC  licence and aerodrome controller  rating, the controller was posted 
to the Hamilton ATC unit .  
3.4.3.  A licensed aerodrome controller  must also have a validation for the ir ATC unit before being 
able to operate alone. Validation training at Hamilton took six months , during which time a 
new aerodrome controller  became familiar with the L ocal U nit Orders15, reporting points, 
arrival and departure sectors, instrument procedures and general aerodrome operations 
specific to the Hamilton  ATC unit.  This training  also included the Hamilton procedures for 
operating a two -person watch.  
3.4.4.  Once competent with operating at Hamilton, the contr oller went through the final proficiency  
assessment then  commenced a regular roster .  Newly validated aerodrome controllers at

 Final Report AO -2015- 009 Hamilton were reassessed a fter six month s, then join ed the standard annual assessment 
cycle .  The controller had a current ATC licence and had gained validation at Hamilton in May 
2014 , then  passed the six -month  reassessment on 19 December 2014.  These incidents 
occurred during the controller's second assessment after validation at Hamilton.  
3.4.5.  The controller had a current Class 3 medical certificate that was valid through to mid -2016 
with no restrictions, conditions or endorsements.  
The assessor  
3.4.6.  The assessor was a n air traffic controller with 10 years of experience  in several control towers 
in New Zealand and Australia.   The assessor had gained an initial on -the-job-instructor rating 
in 2009 and had been upgraded to a check  instructor rating in May 2014 .  The assessor had 
about 18 month s' experience as an assessor at the time of this assessment .  
3.4.7.  The assessor was the Hamilton ATC unit's senior air traffic controller and training manager.  
The first planner  
3.4.8.  The first planner started the early shift at 0540 and was due to finish at 1220.   The first 
planner remained in  position with the controller for th e first 30 minutes , then left the building 
soon after handing over to the second planner .     
3.4.9.  The first planner had about two and a half  years' experience as an aerodrome controller in 
Hamilton and about six months'  experience at Palmerston North.  
The second planner  
3.4.10.  The second planner started a shift at 0820. The second planner was in the aerodrome 
controller  position when the controller arrived , and handed over to the controller at 1110.   The 
second planner took a scheduled 30 -minute break then relieve d the first planner at 1140.   
3.4.11.  The second planner had about one year of experience at Hamilton as an aerodrome controller . 
3.5. Aircraft information  
3.5.1.  The aircraft involved in the final incident were a Diamond DA20 Katana single -engine trainer 
and a Diamond DA42 Twin Star  light twin -engine trainer.   
3.5.2.  The Beechcraft  1900 was the aircraft that did the low approach and overshoot .  The two 
aircraft that were directed into conflict with  each other in the downwind leg  were a  Robin and 
a Katana .

3.6. Aerodrome information  
 
Figure 2 
Standard left -hand circuit pattern  
(from CAA website ) 
3.6.1.  The zone at Hamilton  aerodrome  is shown in Appendix 1.  The runway s in use at the time were  
Runway 18L, which was sealed for 2, 059 metres, and the parallel Runway 18R , which was 
sealed for 630 metres.  
3.6.2.  The downwind leg  for the left -hand circuit started at point 4 in Figure 2 .  Aeroplanes following 
the visual circuit pattern would  normally turn onto final 1 -2 nm out from the threshold at point 
7.  IFR aircraft would also enter this circuit pattern  at point 7 after  a straight -in approach from 
a reporting point 12  nm out (off the bottom of Figure 2).  The right -hand circuit traffic would 
follow a mirror version of the left -hand circuit and also enter the final leg at point 7. 

 
Final Report AO -2015- 009 
<< Page 11 >>
 Circling procedure  
3.6.3.  Circling is a standard IFR procedure that may be used when the final  instrument approach 
track  does not align with the landing direction .  Circling is conducted so that the pilot keeps in 
sight the end of the runway that is to be used for landing .  The pil ot training syllabus for an 
instrument rating  includes practice in the circling manoeuvre .   
3.6.4.  The Hamilton flight training organisations and ATC had agreed to a non -standard circling 
procedure after an IFR straight -in approach .  An IFR training aeroplane would request a circling 
procedure on the flight plan .  The pilot would then reconfirm with the aerodrome controller  
during the approach that it was still acceptable.  
3.6.5.  The circling procedure followed a standard instrument approach from about 10 nm out.  At 
around point 7 on Figure 2 , at about 8 00 feet (245 metres) above sea level  and with the 
runway in sight , the pilot would overshoot and maintain that altitude to the runway threshold 
(point 1) , or another point nominated by the aerodrome controller, where they would 
commence a right -hand circle.  This would bring the aircraft back to point 7 for  a normal 
landing.  Usually the pilot would be cleared to land next , but they could also be instructed to 
extend downwind or reposition for a different sequence.  
3.6.6.  Although the circling manoeuvre was flown with visual reference to the ground, the aircraft  
was still an IFR flight .  ATC was required to provide separation between a n IFR aeroplane 
performing a  circling manoeuvre and other IFR traffic , and to advise IFR t raffic of the 
whereabouts of nearby VFR traffic .

 Final Report AO -2015- 009 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  An aerodrome controller's prime objective is  to maintain a safe flow of air traffic within the 
vicinity of the aerodrome and to provide clearances, instructions and information to pil ots in 
order to prevent collisions.  This is generally achieved in standard circuit patterns by 
sequencing aircraft to minimise speed differentials and allow pilots maximum time to identify 
and avoid other aircraft.  
4.1.2.  Any loss of  separation betw een aircraft is of concern, but it is more so when ATC actions 
intended to prevent a collision are responsible for creating the potential conflict . 
4.1.3.  The following safety issue s are discussed : 
• the standard of team resource management  (TRM)  in the Hamilton ATC 
tower did not match good industry practice  
• changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted some 
VFR traffic congestion to prominent points outside the zone , and likely 
increased the risk of collision in those areas  
• some aerodrome controll ers are 'over -controlling ' VFR traffic in and 
around the zone, which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies 
and risks causing difficulties for inexperienced pilots and those for who m 
English is their second language.   
4.1.4.  The Commission also considered previous ly reported  airspace  incidents and  issues 
that had been raised in  the CAA's  public consultation on a  review of the Hamilton 
airspace  for their  potential influence  on this incident .  The flight activity at Hamilton 
was the most intensive  in the country , with a high  number of airspace incident  
notifications .  It was not clear whether th e number of incidents was due to a 
diligent reporting culture among the flight training organisations, was due to the 
volume of air traffic , or reflected und erlying safety issues.   
4.1.5.  The significant issues that ha ve been of concern to users of the Hamilton airspace are 
described in section 4.5 , along with action s that have been taken to address them . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The controller arrived about 30 minutes before the shift with the expectation that there would 
be time to discuss the assessment process with the assessor.  The assessor  arrived  five 
minutes before the shift was due to start  and met the controller in the cab.  T he briefing was 
reduced to a short exchan ge in the cab as the controller prepared for the handover.  The 
assessor made comments along the lines of  it just being " a normal day" .  However, the other 
two aerodrome  controllers in the cab were not part of this discussion, so the usual 'setting of 
the scene' and agreeing on team expectations were not achieved before the assessment 
began.  
4.2.2.  The traffic remained moderate for the first 30 minutes,  with a constant demand from aircraft 
wanting to enter the zone.   It then increased because most IFR training aircraft had requested 
circling approaches , which slowed the circuit flow  and increased the controller's workload . 
Circuit training was also taking place with up to four aircraft at a time.  
4.2.3.  Soon after accept ing the handover as aerodrome controller , there were  indicat ions that the 
controller was not in total control of the situation.  The situation became increasingly worse 
until the assessor relieved the controller.  The controller had tried to accommodate all p ilot 
requests, but in doing so had not achieved  an orderly flow , anticipated  conflict or managed  the 
number of aircraft within the circuit. The controller had also been unable to keep  the flight 
strips current  to reflect traffic in the circuits and  the instrument approach . 
4.2.4.  The first incident began when the controller allow ed the Beechcraft  1900 to conduct a low 
approach and overshoot  in an already moderately busy circuit . The Beechcraft  1900 pilot's  
 
Final Report AO -2015- 009 
<< Page 13 >>
 request could have been declined , which would have avo ided an unnecessary increase  in the 
controller's workload  and a disruption to aircraft already in the circuit .  The controller then 
omitted to advise two light aircraft following the Beechcraft  1900 of the risk of wake 
turbulence.  
4.2.5.  In the second incident the controller issued instructions that brought the Katana and Robin 
unnecessarily into conflict .  When the potential conflict was pointed out by the planner, the 
controller reacted by issuing an instruction that further increased the ri sk of a collision.  
4.2.6.  In the third set of incidents the radar conflict alert warnings were indicating that the  final 
approach area was congested.  T he controller  had approved consecutive  IFR aircraft to do 
circling approaches , then sequenced them too close t o each other .  The first one was circling 
back to line up when the radar detected the potential conflict as the next one approached.  
4.2.7.  An analysis of the ATC recordings revealed t he controller 's pace of speech increas ing near to 
the end of the assessment per iod.  The controller also spoke more often in an effort to provide 
traffic information to the pilots  of all the aircraft under control .  Trainee pilots had less time to 
comprehend and respond to the controller's instructions and others were  blocked from 
transmitting.  
4.2.8.  The fourth incident included two serious aspects.  The first was a  loss of separation for an IFR 
aeroplane under the controller's instructions and the second was the non -standard  
instructions given to a VFR student pilot who was on their  first solo  flight .  It was normal 
protocol at Hamilton for aerodrome controllers to provide a clear space around first solo flights 
to allow the pilot s to concentrate on their flying.   The VFR student's flight instructor had 
advised the controller that this st udent was on their first solo  flight  and the controller had 
acknowledged  this before the instructor left the aircraft . 
4.2.9.  At this point t he assessor took over as aerodrome controller  and cleared all aircraft from the 
approach area for the VFR student pilot to be the first to land.  The second planner assisted 
the assessor to identify and resolve traffic conflicts and to re -establish an orderly flow.    
Related factors   
4.2.10.  The controller had been working at the Hamilton ATC unit for about 18 months. The controller 
had been assessed multiple times during the initial six -month validation training.  The most 
recent assessment had been the first during op erational duty at six months' experienc e, and 
the assessment  on this day was  the second .  The controller had worked the afternoon shift on 
the day before without incident . The controller's actions on this day were uncharacteristic.  
4.2.11.  The weather conditions on the day were fi ne, clear  and not a factor in this incident.  The 
amount of traffic was not out of the ordinary for Hamilton, nor was it unmanageable.  The 
controller had managed situations like this safely before.  Shortly after the controller was 
relieved, the unit manager was c onfident that the less experienced second planner could take 
over as a solo watch until a relief could be arranged . The air traffic movement frequency 
remained  similar to that during the incident.  
4.2.12.  The Monday and Tuesday before the incidents had been schedu led days off for the controller , 
then the controller  worked the Wednesday afternoon shift.  The controller had received private 
flying lessons on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning.  The controller later admitted not 
feeling the best at the start of  the Thursday shift , but had felt well enough to not call in sick. 
For these reasons,  fatigue and illness were discounted as factors.  
4.2.13.  However, t he controller was nervous about the assessment  and wanted  time to discuss this 
with the assessor before the assessment began .  When th e pre -briefing was replaced with a 
short exchange in the cab , the controller was concerned .  The controller was anxious to 
demonstrate proficiency.  The issue of how the assessment was performed is discussed in  the 
following sections.  
4.2.14.  It was evident from the four incidents noted in this report  and the written comments from the 
assessor that the controller was reacting to pilot requests rather than being in control of 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 managing the traffic flow and the team.  The rapid issuing of traffic information and increased 
rate of speech late in the assessment were both indicators that the controller was feeling 
under pressure  (EATCHIP, 1997, p. 31) . 
4.2.15.  The Commission engaged a clinical psy chologist16 to assist at interviews of key participants 
and to analyse the controller's actions from a psychological perspective.  The psychologist's 
assessment of the controller's actions stated, in part:  
The controller appears to have experienced 'choking  under pressure', a 
phenomen on defined as "a critical deterioration in the execution of habitual 
processes as a result of elevation in anxiety under perceived pressure, leading to 
substandard performance" (Mesagno, Harvey, & Janelle, 2012) .  The effect is 
commonly observed in athletes and students and characterised by levels of 
performance which are below those that would normally be expected.  While 
such an event may be embarrassing rather than life -threatening in a sporting 
event, its occurrence in an aviation context represents a potential risk to safety. 
4.2.16.  For a number of reasons, the controller did not achieve  their  normal standard of proficiency  on 
that day .  However, one person's actions or inactions should not result in accidents or 
incidents  if other preventive measures are in place .  Properly followed policies  and procedures 
and, above all else, teamwork should prevent an accident or incident occurring.  The following 
sections discuss other  safety issues with the wider system in which the controller was working.  
Finding  
1. The series of incidents occurred because the controller became overwhelmed by the 
circumstances on the day then lost situational awareness of the aircraft within the control  
zone .  
 
4.3. The air traffic control assessment process  
Proficiency expectations  
4.3.1.  The ATC assessment  process includes 10 competencies that a n aerodrome  controller  must 
demonstrate. The top three core competencies are: apply situational awareness; manage the 
traffic situatio n to achieve an orderly flow; and critically analyse traffic for potential conflict 
and apply timely resolutions.  These core competencies provide the foundation skills that an 
aerodrome  controller needs  to manage air traffic  safely .  
4.3.2.  An aerodrome controller  develops their primary situational awareness by looking for aircraft 
out of a window and listening to local radio frequencies.  Their main tool is t he flight progress 
board with which they track aircraft through sectors and stages of arrival and  departure.  They 
can also use  the surveillance radar to confirm the identity of a distant visual contact and to 
check on aircraft position s. 
4.3.3.  An aerodrome controller  also manage s the operational team's workload.   That is, they manage 
their own performance and any interpersonal factors that might prevent the team performing 
in a supportive manner.  In the broader sense, this means the aerodrome controller  must be 
aware of each individual's workload and set the pace of traffic flow to match the team 
capacity.

 4.3.4.  By the time a n aerodrome  controller has gained their licence, they will have progressed 
through a rigorous training system with regular progress assessments and tests followed by a 
period of on -the-job instruction.  After further check observations and simulated assessments,  
they are assessed for their licence.   By the time they are licensed , validated and operational at  
an active  ATC unit, they are considered to  be acting competently and responsibly.  
4.3.5.  Consequently, a  proficiency assessment  would normally be  a routine process resulting in 
minor changes to improve  their  technique .  It would therefore be unusual for an assessment 
to be terminated for operational reasons . 
4.3.6.  Individual aerodrome controllers  may react differe ntly to the same stimulus.  In order to 
conduct a fair assessment of proficiency, the assessment process must not impose an 
artificial pressure on the person being assessed  or the operational team.   The CAA Advisor y 
Circular AC65 -9 contains a checklist of items against which an instructor is assessed to 
become an assessor.  The list covers for example, the instructor's ability : to conduct a pre -
assessment briefing17 with the person to be assessed  in an appropriate env ironment; to 
reduce stress the person being assessed  may be feeling; and to advise others who may be 
affected by the assessment that it is going to take place, including any special requirements 
the assessor may have for them.  
This assessment  
4.3.7.  Due to the assessor 's time of arrival, the standard pre -assessment briefing  was replaced by  a 
brief conversation in  the cab , then  the assessment started with the handover of ATC to the 
controller . The assessor did not  conduct the required key de -stressing actions before the 
assessment  began  or determine whether the controller was ready  to be assessed .  
4.3.8.  The assessor noticed a degree of tension in the cab upon arrival .  The assessor attributed the 
tension to something between the three aerodrome controllers.  The oth er two aerodrome 
controllers  in the cab were unaware until then that an assessment was to be performed.  In 
the absence of a formal briefing, the others were left to assume what the assessor expected 
of them  during the assessment .  
4.3.9.  The assessor became  increasingly uncomfortable with the controller's performance during the 
assessment , particularly the management of potential traffic conflicts .  The assessor had been 
involved with the controller's training at the Hamilton ATC unit and was familiar with t he 
controller's style.   It was clear to the assessor that the controller was not operating normally or 
to the required standard, but the assessor was unsure if the assessment could be terminate d 
early.   The assessor  intended to discuss  this with the unit m anager at  the next schedul ed 
break.  
4.3.10.  According to a  senior Airways ATC examiner at the air traffic controller training centre , if a 
person being assessed does not meet any one of the 10 competencies, they are not 
competent to remain in control and the assessment should be terminated.   The examiner also 
said that an  assessor should not let a situation develop to an extent that an incident occurs  
but acknowledged that it " was a subjective judgement call ".  The examiner further explained 
that " the aerodrom e environment is particularly tricky as things happen so much more quickly 
and aeroplanes are much closer to each other ".  
4.3.11.  Based on these comments from the examiner , it would have been good practice  to stop the 
assessment or withdraw the controller from th eir active position within the first 30 minutes . 
Other qualified aerodrome controllers were present at the time to take over .  The unit manager 
could also have been signalled to go to the cab if required . 
                                                        
 
 
17 The assessment briefing is outlined in Appendix C of AC65 -9 and the guidance provided in  the 
International Civil Aviation Organization's Air Traffic Services Planning Manual (Doc 9426 -AN/924)   

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 4.3.12.  Airways submitted that it  "will undertake a review of the assessment procedure to determine 
any further improvements across Airways on how assessment should be carried out, including 
steps to support staff to make better judgement calls in such assessment situations ". 
4.3.13.  The circumstan ces of the assessment appear to have affected the team  dynamics  in the cab ; 
this is addressed in the following section.   
4.4. Team resource management  
Safety issue : The standard of team resource management in the Hamilton ATC tower did not match 
good industry p ractice .  
Operational team work  
4.4.1.  Airways say s that it operates with a 'just culture' in which  people are encouraged to provide 
essential safety -related information. A just culture is defined as:  
One where front line operators are not punished for actions, omissions or 
decisions taken by them which are commensurate with their experience and 
training but where gross negligence, wilful violations and destructive acts are not 
tolerated (EUROCONTROL, 2018) .  
4.4.2.  The European Air Traffic Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme18 has been co -
ordinating ATC standards across Europe  for more than 20  years and has an extensive library 
on related human factors19. In 2009, EUROCONTR OL identified that teamwork was one of the 
top 10 priority areas for ATC that needed further work if it was  going to improve on the current 
level of safety.   It produced a guideline for good TRM in ATC  (EUROCONTROL, 2015) .  The 
International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) introduced a n associated framework , called 
'Threat and Error Management' (ICAO, 2008) , to help ATC managers understand and manage 
system and human performance in operational conte xts to enhance aviation safety.  
4.4.3.  The aim of  TRM  is to provide a strategy for air navigation service providers , such as Airways, to 
make the best use of all available resources (information, equipment and people) to optimise 
the safety and efficiency of air traffic services  (EUROCONTROL, 2007) .  In such an 
environment, a member of an operational team should feel free to raise a safety concern with 
another member of the team during a situation  and that person should be able to accept and 
use that feedback to improve the team performance.   To be effective, the team must also 
have a clear vision of what behaviour is preferred and what is unacceptable in terms of their 
professional responsibilities  and standards .  The team members must also understand and 
put into practice the human factors concepts that contribute to an efficient team  and 
teamwork . 
4.4.4.  Airways trains aerodrome controllers to be competent in solo -watch position s.  Teamwork, 
interpersonal communication and other teamwork -related human factors are covered in the 
basic ATC course , then again through the aerodrome controller course  in Christchurch .  During 
the on -the-job instruction phase in Palmerston North, they learn to task share with planner s, 
but this is specific to Pa lmerston North.  During the validation training at Hamilton they are 
taught the specific task -sharing for that ATC unit.  However, task -sharing is not the same as 
TRM or teamwork.  
4.4.5.  The aerodrome controller  is in charge of the operational team, which includ es a planner for 
dual watch periods and may include a flight data assistant.   Both aerodrome controllers  are

seamless European ATC system.  
19 Human factors is the application of psychological and physiological principles to the (engineering and) 
design of products, processes,  and systems. The goal of human factors is to reduce human error, increase 
productivity, and enhance safety and comfort with a specific focus on the interaction between the human 
and the thing of interest.

 qualified in each role and they usually swap roles during a shift.   Although an assessor was 
present for this incident, the assessor is not normally part of the operational team.  However, 
in an emergency the assessor is able to perform the aerodrome controller  or planner role and 
is a resource available to the operationa l team.  The assessor's presence can also ha ve an 
effect on the operational team dynamics.   
4.4.6.  Airways had developed a training course to improve teamwork and raise the professional 
standards of controllers , but at the time of this incident none of the Hamilt on controllers had 
completed the course . 
Team  resource management  in the cab  
4.4.7.  Both planners were familiar with the controller's style and recognised that the controller was 
not performing well  at the time.  The second planner was of the view that it was the  
controller's licence at sta ke and did not see that as a shared responsibility .  The assessor had 
not clarified with the two planners what was expected of them during the assessment .  
4.4.8.  There were some elements of co -operation and some advice given to the controller , but overall 
the circuit patterns were regularly overloaded , which indicated that  the team had not 
manage d the traffic flow  well .  
4.4.9.  At one point while on  a rest break at the rear of the cab , the second planner observed  the 
emerging situation that resulted in the second incident.  The second planner voiced their  
concern to  both  the first planner and the assessor.   The first planner relayed th at concern to  
the controller .  The controller then attempted to resolve the conflict  but was not successful in 
doing so .  
4.4.10.  The second planner  said later that both planners had suggested to the controller at different 
times that they land some of the aeroplanes on circuit training  to ease the workload , but that 
did not happen .  Landing some of the c ircuiting aircraft was  a standard tool used by 
aerodrome controllers at Hamilton to relieve traffic congestion.   The planner organise d aircraft 
waiting to enter the zone so was  usually more in touch than the aerodrome controller with the 
immediate future traffic demand and able to advise the controller  if a peak was due.  
4.4.11.  When the assessor eventually took control , the team dynamics suddenly changed .  The 
second planner immediately became more co-operative and took proactive steps to assist the 
assessor to  reduce congestion in the zone.   There could have been several reasons for this 
change , such as the assessment having been terminated or the immediate risk of further 
incidents.  However , it also emphasised how the team had not worked during the assessment.  
4.4.12.  The incident highlighted the importance of working together as a team.  It also emphasised 
the importance of setting the scene for the team before an assessment.  Normally, regardless 
of who is in control, it would be a team responsibility to manage traffi c in a zone.  This should 
not change when an assessment is being conducted.   Although an assessment may be 
focused on an individual's proficiency, it should also include the proficiency of other members 
of that  team in support ing the team objectives.  
Team dynamics  at the  Hamilton ATC  unit 
4.4.13.  A well performing team needs to put personal differences aside and work together.  However, 
some of the interpersonal dynamics at the ATC unit were likely to have influenced the 
operational team's performance on this day.  
4.4.14.  The unit manager had been in  the role  for just over three years at the time  of these incidents 
and had  previous management training and experience  as a manager  with Airways and other 
employers.  The unit manager  said that Airways had provided  management s upport and 
guidance  in the current role .  The unit manager was responsible for all activities within the ATC 
unit, including operational standards,  training , recruiting and maintaining the unit's business 
relationships with other users and customers.  The unit manager had attempted 
unsuccessfully to resolve personality conflicts between several aerodrome controllers .  The 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 last measure  was to separate those aerodrome  controllers to some extent with roster 
adjustments.  
4.4.15.  Hamilton employ ed only qualified aer odrome controllers , and most were recently licensed 
through the Airways ATC training system .  During an aerodrome controller's last stage of 
training at the Palmerston North ATC unit, the unit manager there spent  a lot of time in the 
cab working with the t rainees and offering mentoring advice and guidance.   The Hamilton ATC 
unit manager was unable to provide this level of support in the cab , and relied on other 
methods of feedback to check on service delivery and team performance.  
4.4.16.  The unit manager  had attempted to roster more experienced aerodrome controllers to work 
alongside the new ones as unofficial mentors , but it had not always  been  possible  with a high 
proportion of inexperienced  aerodrome  controllers working in the Hamilton ATC unit, nor had  it 
been effective .  For example, i n one situation, well  intended mentoring advice had led to 
conflict .  
4.4.17.  The Commission was informed repeatedly that the Hamilton ATC unit was an undesirable 
place for  aerodrome  controllers to work . This  was claimed to be mainl y associated with the 
heavy workload  at Hamilton compared to other locations where aerodrome controllers had  the 
same employment conditions .  Consequently, staff  turnover  was high and tenure was short at 
Hamilton . Replacements proved difficult  to engag e and, overall, the workload had a 
detrimental effect on staff.   The main source of replacements was the Airways training centre , 
where graduates had little  choice for their first post ing.   
4.4.18.  This default  influx of recent graduate s lower ed the average experience level of aerodrome 
controllers at Hamilton.   Once qualified, a n aerodrome  controller gains experience in the role 
but will take time to develop judgement to handle situations that are different from their 
training environments.   It was  difficult  for the unit manager to manage this risk when there 
were  only eight aerodrome controllers in the establishment and more than 50% had less than 
two years' experience as licen sed aerodrome controller s.  The unit manager had employed 
aerodrome controllers fr om overseas at times in order to meet the unit's  minimum -experience 
target.  
4.4.19.  The aerodrome operator20 was concerned about the relative inexperience of aerodrome 
controllers and their high turnover rate. It  had recommended in its  aeronautical study in 2012  
(refer to section 4.5.5 ) that Airways "consider options associated with ensuring aerodrome 
controller turnover is minimised ".  CTC Aviation Training (NZ) Limited ( CTC) , the major flight 
training operator at Hamilton, had raised the risk rating for its  Hamilton operations in 
December 2017 as a consequence of its concern about the average experience of the 
aerodrome controllers.  
4.4.20.  The potential risk presented by the la ck of experienced aerodrome controllers at Hamilton and 
the predominance of recent graduates appears to have reduced with the introduction of a 
mentoring role.   This risk is well known and a focus point within the aerodrome safety system.  
Airways submitted that the relevant practices at the Hamilton unit did not differ because of  the 
level of aerodrome controller experience.   However, others operating at the aerodrome 
disagreed .  As the existing aerodrome safety systems have been further developed , this issue 
can be managed at a local level.  For th is reason , a safety recommendation has not been 
issued  to Airways .  
4.4.21.  Actions taken by Airways , including an organisation al restructure and training provided to the 
unit manager and aerodrome contro llers, is expected to improve teamwork and free up some 
of the unit manager's time to raise service delivery standards.  This has alleviated the need for 
a safety recommendation  to Airways in relation to teamwork .

 Findings  
2. The assessment that was being conducted of the controller affected the normal team 
dynamics in the control tower , partly because a standard pre -assessment briefing was not 
conducted  and the expectations of the team during the assessment were not explained . 
3. During the assessment there  was a breakdown in the team approach to managing the 
traffic in the aerodrome circuit, which was a significant factor contributing to th is series of 
incidents .  
4. Airways ' practice of posting a high proportion of recently qualified aerodrome controllers 
with limited experience to Hamilton aerodrome, one of the busiest in the country, had the 
potential to raise  the risk profile of the ATC unit . 
4.5. The wider safety issues for Hamilton aerodrome  
4.5.1.  Participants in the aviation system are required by Civil Aviation Rules Part 12 , Accidents, 
Incidents, and Statistics,  to notify the CAA of accidents and certain incidents.  They are also 
required to investigate incidents that they notif y and to provide the CAA with the results of 
those investigations.  Hamilton aerodrome  had a high rate of  incident notifications to the CAA.  
The CAA 's involvement  with the aerodrome safety system had been  largely confined to 
monitoring events, until it was  prompted to examine the aerodrome safety system after a 
near -collision i n 2013.  
4.5.2.  The Commission had also been  monitoring the incidence of airspace notifications at Hamilton .  
This inquiry provided an opportunity for the Commission to examine  the underlying  issues in  
the wider aerodrome safety system.  The more significant safety issues that were  of concern 
to participants at Hamilton aerodrome are described below . 
The aerodrome safety system  was ine ffective  
4.5.3.  In 2005  CTC started up operations at Hamilton aerodrome .  The high number of trainee pilots 
greatly increased the workload for aerodrome controllers. During 2015 CTC had about 15 
aircraft in the air during the peak training period each day, with several in the circuit at any 
time.  
4.5.4.  The CAA encourages t he creation of u ser groups  to improve safety at aerodromes where there 
are multiple users , often  with different airspace requirements.  Airways took the lead in setting 
up a user group at Hamilton  and ran it until the aerodrome operator took over . 
4.5.5.  In 2011 , as a result of a safety concern , the CAA require d the aerodrome  operator to conduct 
an aeronautical study21 under C ivil Aviation Rules Part 139, Aerodrome -  Certification, 
Operation and Use .  The study wa s intended to review the aerodrome and operations  to 
ensure that appropriate  safety criteria were in place .  The aerodrome  operator provided the 
aeronautical study report to the CAA in May 2012.  
4.5.6.  The CAA used the incident data notified by aerodrome participants in accordance with Civil 
Aviation Rules Part 12  to prepare  statistical safety performance data for each  aerodrome .  An 
aerodrome operator needed to know the relevant data and analyses in order to fulfil its 
responsibilities in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules Part 139.  Until 2014 the CAA had not 
provided aerodrome operators with this data .  The Hamilton aerodrome operator had obta ined

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 copies of th e information from Airways .  The  CAA now sends monthly incident data report s to 
all Part 139 aerodrome operators.  
4.5.7.  In January 2013 the CAA investigated a near -collision  at Hamilton , which led to an 
investigation of wider issues related to the airspace incidents22.  The safety investigation 
revealed a strained relationship between Airways and CTC  and a failure by participants to 
identify the root causes  of th e incidents .  The CAA assisted the parties to resolve these issues 
and in May 2013 conducted a two -day workshop at Hamilton with all users.   The parties 
changed their behaviour  and by the end of th at year the aerodrome  operator had taken over 
its responsibility under Part 139 to lead the aerodrome  safety system .  
4.5.8.  The previous  user group was  disbanded and replaced with a structured governance group with  
sub-committees for aerodrome  management,  safety and operations . Meetings were held 
regular ly, and minutes  produced with action items to complete for the next meeting.  Airways 
and CTC rebuilt  their damaged relationship and  were  foster ing their future co -operation . 
4.5.9.  By 2017 aerodrome users were report ing that the aerodrome operator's safety management 
system was an effective platform for resolving local safety issues.  
The zone was too large and boundaries not clearly defined  
Safety issue - Changes in the size and shape of the Hamilton zone have shifted s ome VFR traffic 
congestion to prominent points outside the zone , and likely increased the risk of collision in those 
areas . 
4.5.10.  The zone covered the aerodrome  and the instrument approach paths to  the north  and south .  
VFR entry and exit sectors were located on  the e astern and w estern sides.  It was  classified as  
Class D airspace , which required  ATC to provide separation between IFR traffic and between 
IFR and special VFR traffic. VFR traffic was responsible for its own separation.  
4.5.11.  The size of the zone was claimed by some users as  too large , because it resulted in one 
aerodrome controller  having too many aircraft to manage .  Another concern was that  the 
boundary of the zone was  difficult to identify from the air .  There w as also criticism that  the 
Hamilton zone was depicted across  the edges  of adjacent navigation  charts , which was a  
challeng e for novice pilots  as they swapped between charts in busy airspace.  
4.5.12.  The CAA conducted a review and public consultation as part of its continuing airspace review 
conducted under Civil Aviation Rules Part 71 , Design and Classification of Airspace .  In late 
2016  the zone was redesigned and reduced in size .  The chart issue was still being 
considered . 
4.5.13.  After these changes were promulgated, the rate of airspace occurrences started to decrease. 
Data for the 12 months following  the airspace changes show ed a significant and sustained 
drop in airspace occurrences at Hamilton. 
4.5.14.  However, the changes had the effect of shifting congestion to uncontrolled airspace , and 
some features of the proposed circular flow in the circuit were not implemented.  The crucial 
benefit that the CAA expected from the airspace changes was a more efficient circuit traffic 
flow, but this has not been achieved.  According to CTC, d epartures ha d improved , but arrivals 
are still directed to join at the start of the downwind leg or late downwind , only to  be extended 
further downwind.  This has led  to a concentration  of VFR aircraft just outside the zone near  
easily recognisable landmarks , and has likely increased the risk of a collision near those 
points .

 4.5.15.  Consequently, t he airspace design around Hamilton and the traffic density have created a 
hazard  in uncontrolled airspace.   The VFR arrival procedures described in the Aeronautical 
Information Publication  (AIP NZ)23 draw pilots to a reporting area within a 300 -foot (91 -metre) 
height band adjacent to the lower limit of the 2, 000-foot  (609 -metre) control area above the 
aerodrome.   This height band is further limited if a pilot wishes to stay clear of the overhead 
control area with a self -imposed safety buffer.  Multiple VFR aircraft could be holding in this 
narrow band , with the pilots keeping a look out for other aircraft.  
4.5.16.  There is no guidance for VFR pilots on  a safe approach procedure to the zone while awaiting 
clearance to enter.  Nothing is mentioned in the VFR arrival charts or documented in the 
Hamilton control tower Local Unit Orders  for aerodrome controllers  to manage pote ntial 
queues of aircraft hold ing outside the zone .  Local users ha ve asked the CAA to produce a 
'Good Aviation Practice ' booklet for the Hamilton area,  but one has not  yet been written .  Local 
users mitigate this congestion through  their own operational pr ocedures, but itinerant  users of 
the aerodrome are unlikely to be aware of them and are not bound by them .  
4.5.17.  The airspace changes have reduced the rate of incident reports in the zone , but it is apparent 
from user feedback obtained in late 2017 for this investigation that not all issues have been 
resolved and that the CAA needs to remain actively involved  with the aerodrome safety groups .  
A safety recommendation to the CAA has been made to this effect.  
ATC over -controlling  and excessive traffic information  
Safety issue - Some aerodrome controllers are 'over -controlling ' VFR traffic in and around the zone, 
which is unnecessarily congesting the radio frequencies and risks causing difficulties for inexperienc ed 
pilots and those for who m English is their second language.  
4.5.18.  During 2010 a CAA audit of the Hamilton ATC unit found that it was providing separation 
between  VFR aircraft inside the Class D airspace zone.  This was  not part of the required 
service for C lass D airspace and it created the possibility for pilots to misinterpret  what to 
expect from ATC .  Users also claimed  that ATC was often over -controlling.   
4.5.19.  Over -controlling was also found to be occurring by the CAA investigation in 2013 , which also 
noted incidents of non -standard phraseology, overly long communications and ambiguous 
messages . The audio records reviewed during th is series of incidents in 2015 identified that 
the aerodrome controllers were passing excessive traffic information to  aeroplanes when  
there was no  need .  CTC continue d to raise similar concerns about over -controlling in 2017 
through the aerodrome safety system , and emphasise d that protracted traffic information was  
a challenge for most trainees, including those with English as their  first language .  
4.5.20.  The majority of air traffic in the  Hamilton zone is VFR , for which  ATC does not provide 
separation .  ATC is required to provide information or instructions to pilots within the zone 
when necessary , to help them to avoid collisions  and to create a patterned and sequenced 
flow.  Many of the aircraft in the Hamilton circuit patterns would be irrelevant to a pilot about 
to join downwind for the left -hand circuit , when that pilot would just expect a sequence and to 
be able to identify the aerop lane ahead.  
4.5.21.  The guidance provided in AIP NZ Gen 3.3 .1324 states that traffic information is issued " to alert 
a pilot to other known or observed air traffic that may be in proximity to the position or 
intended route of flight and to help the pilot avoid a collision ". This is the same as the 
definition for traffic information in Airways ' Manual of Air Traffic Services.

<< Page 22 >>
 Final Report AO -2015- 009 4.5.22.  However, t he text within Airways ' Manual of Air Traffic Services  has a broader interpretation  for 
when ATC is required to provide information .  It states25 that pilots shall be advised of "traffic 
operating in the 'vicinity of the aerodrome ' that may constitute a hazard to the aircraft 
concerned " and leaves it to the judgement of the aerodrome controller  to determine when it is 
necessary in the interests of safety.  The ' vicinity ' of the aerodrome includes all aircraft within 
the circuit patterns and the zone.    
4.5.23.  The CAA investigation in 2013 found several anomalies between the interpretation of written 
procedures and  the requirements for A TC services in documents produced by the CAA, Airways 
and ICAO. It also found that Airways ' Local Unit Orders for the Hamilton ATC unit were the 
responsibility of the unit manager , which opened the possibility of different interpretations for 
the same airs pace category around the country.  
4.5.24.  As the issue of aerodrome controllers over -controlling and passing excessive information is 
still evident at Hamilton, the cause seems to be embedded in the ATC training system and the 
predominance of inexperienced aerodr ome controllers  at the Hamilton ATC unit, as referred to 
in previous sections.   A safety recommendation has been made to Airways to address this 
issue.  
Language barriers  
4.5.25.  Most of the pilot trainees at Hamilton come from outside New Zealand , and for many English 
is not their first language.  They have to be able to communicate in English before they can 
start training , but accents remain strong. This can hinder communication with ATC and 
highlights the importance of standard phraseology  and pace of deliver y.  
4.5.26.  Language was a concern to Airways , but CTC considered that a  greater risk  was to ignore  the 
cultural differences . Some cultures are reluctant to express  difference s of opinion and some 
pilot trainees may attempt to comply explicitly with ATC instructio ns.  The concern was that 
such obedience could expose a pilot to exceeding their own abilities or their aircraft's 
capa bilities if an  ATC instruction  were impractical.  
IFR circling procedure  
4.5.27.  The IFR training syllabus was  required to cover the circling pro cedure after an instrument 
approach .  The l ocal arrangement  for this procedure required an IFR pilot to become visual 
with the runway and conduct a right -hand circle from the threshold  of Runway 18 at 800 feet  
(245 metres) above  sea level .  If traffic al lowed  they would be sequenced as number one,  but 
otherwise they would be required to extend downwind at low level away from the threshold to 
join with  a different  sequence.  
4.5.28.  As an exercise, this local procedure  did not instil  the correct procedure  for circli ng because the 
pilot lost sight of  the runway  and then came back to the same vector .  More importantly, as 
seen during these incidents, the orbit in the final approach area  created congestion and a 
collision risk .  
4.5.29.  The parties involved have since agreed on a more practical and realistic method that positions  
aircraft into the normal active circuit pattern.  
Circuit booking system  
4.5.30.  In order to help reduce the peak  number  of aircraft doing circuit training, a booking sys tem 
was established  to spread circuit use  across the day .  CTC has three ' slots ' and Waikato 
Aviation  one slot .  The slots are managed online , with aircraft being booked for half-hour slots. 
When th e allotted  time is up, the pilot land s or leave s the circu it pattern.   CTC and Waikato

Final Report AO -2015- 009 
<< Page 23 >>
 Aviation may  sometimes negotiate more slots from  each other 's allocation , but four  aircraft in 
the circuit at once is the maximum available .  
4.5.31.  Airways may reduce traffic density by instructing a pilot  on circuit training  to land for a period .  
This allows the aerodrome controller to clear the traffic peaks within  the zone.  
4.5.32.  CTC agreed to fund a flight data assistant part -time in the tower to assist the aerodrome 
controllers with administration tasks and managing the circuit  booking system.   This funding 
was increased during 2017  to employ the flight data assistant five days per week.  
Summary conclusions  
4.5.33.  Hamilton aerodrome  has had many issues over many years that have caused acrimony 
between users and led to airspace incident s.  By 2017 the aerodrome operator, Airways and 
other users ha d made significant progress  in resolving those issues and improving aerodrome 
safety .  Some issues still remain , but these  can be managed through the aerodrome safety 
system  with assistance from  the CAA.  
4.5.34.  CAA statistical data indicate that there has been a significant safety improvement at Hamilton 
since late 2016, one year after the incident that initiated this inquiry.  This improvement  is 
coincident with changes introduced to the Hamilton zone by the CAA and Airways.  
Finding s 
5. Airspace incidents  within  the Hamilton control zone  have reduced since airspace 
changes , but not all user concerns have been resolved and the risk of a conflict outsi de 
the zone has increased  as a result . 
6. Some aerodrome controllers at Hamilton were passing more traffic information to pilots 
than was necessary, which instead of improving aviation safety was creating radio 
congestion and difficulties for pilots, particul arly those for whom English was their second 
language .

 Final Report AO -2015- 009 5. Findings  
5.1. The series of incidents occurred because the controller became overwhelmed by the 
circumstances on the day  then  lost situational awareness of the aircraft within the control 
zone .  
5.2. The assessment that was being conducted of the controller affected the normal team 
dynamics in the control tower, partly because a standard pre -assessment briefing was not 
conducted and the expectations of the team during the assessment were not explained . 
5.3. During the assessment  there was a breakdown in the team approach to managing the traffic

5.4. Airways ' practice of posting a high proportion of recent ly qualifi ed aerodrome controllers with 
limited experience to  Hamilton aerodrome, one of the busiest in the country, had the potential 
to raise  the risk profile of the ATC unit . 
5.5. Airspace incidents within the Hamilton control zone have reduced since airspace changes , but 
not all user concerns have been resolved and the risk of a conflict outside the zone has 
increased as a result.  
5.6. Some aerodrome controllers at Hamilton were passing  more traffic information to pilots than 
was necessary, which instead of improving aviation safety wa s creating radio congestion and

 Final Report AO -2015- 009 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. Subsequent action taken b y Airways gave  it the confidence to return the controller to full 
operational duty at Hamilton.  The controller has passed at least two annual proficiency 
assessments since this series of incidents, and has since been posted to another ATC unit.  
7.3. Airways in troduced a n aerodrome  controller mentoring system at Hamilton and is considering 
rolling it out nationwide.  
7.4. All aerodrome controllers at Hamilton have attended an Airways -developed course called 
Coaching on the Go , which  is intended to improve professional working standards and ethical 
conduct. It has  recently been reported that the team is working together better and that other 
aerodrome controllers are now more open to being posted to Hamilton.   
7.5. Airways restructured it s national management in early 2016. This separated Airways ' business 
development and national training functions from the responsibility of unit managers.  This 
change should relieve  the Hamilton unit manager of some administrative tasks and allow 
them to  focus on managing the team and maintaining operational standards.  
7.6. The circling procedure has been reviewed by the parties involved and a new method of 
conducting this exercise has been agreed.   The change removes the low -level orbit and 
sequence congestion near the final leg of the circuit.  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.7. The CAA completed its revision of the Hamilton airspace after public consultation , and 
promulgated the new zone boundary in November 2016.   It was adjusted two more  times 
during 2017 in response to user feedback.

 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.  In this case, recom mendations have been issued to Civil Aviation Authority and 
Airways . 
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
futur e. 
Recommendation  to the CAA 
8.3. The CAA has conducted public consultations to address safety issues with the Hamilton zone 
and promulgated changes.  These changes have  focused on problems within the zone but 
have  also  created new hazards  outside the zone.  Th e high VFR  traffic volumes around 
Hamilton create a risk of mid -air collisions near the common entry routes to the zone that local 
operators cannot manage effectively without CAA involvement .  One suggestion from the local 
users to manage this risk is for the CAA to publish  a 'Good A viation Practice ' booklet that 
explains the best practice for VFR entry to and exit from the zone.  
On 23 August 2018  the Commission is therefore recommendin g that the Director of Civil 
Aviation  raise public awareness of the VFR traffic around the Hamilton area and work closely 
with aerodrome safety groups to resolve congestion hazards and traffic flow routes into and 
out of the zone.   (020/18)  
On 12 September 2018, Civil Aviation Authority rep lied:  
The CAA in its accepta nce of final recommendation 020/18, will carry out the 
following:  
1 The ongoing proactive liaison will continue with the user group for the purposes 
of supporting active airspace risk mitigation.  
2 In the longer term, a GAP booklet that will focus on the a irspace in and around 
Hamilton will be compiled with a publishing date envisaged by August 2020.  
Recommendation to Airways  
8.4. The situation where some aerodrome controllers at the Hamilton ATC unit have been 'over -
controlling' by providing VFR pilots with excessive and unnecessary traffic information was 
described by the CAA in a 2013 report. Evidence of it still occurring was found during this 
inquiry in 2015 and it was  still being  raised as a safety issue through the aerodrome safety 
system and CAA notifications in 2017 .  It presents an ongoing safety risk to the high number 
of trainee pilots based in Hamilton.  
On 23 August 2018  the Commission is therefore recommending that the Chi ef Executive 
Officer of Airways review the current practices of aerodrome control at Hamilton  to ensure  that 
the level of ATC service is consistent with C AA rules and the aerodrome safety system.   
(021/18)  
On 6 September 2018, Airways replied : 
Airways wish es to confirm that it will implement the final recommendation of the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission pertaining to the Hamilton ATC unit. 
Much has already been done by way of changes made to the Hamilton airspace to 
reduce potential confliction s and the need for traffic information, however the 
following additional actions along with a proposed timeline will be undertaken.

1 A senior Performance Coach to conduct an 
independent live observations audit of current 
traffic information provision practice. This audit 
will also include:  
• A review of national and local unit training and 
operational guidance material to ensure it 
adequately sets expectations of the required 
performance outcome.  
• Measure current traffic information provision 
compliance against regulatory expectations. 
• Canvasing local users for evidence of specific 
areas of non - compliance 
• Making recommendations where necessary 
that would ensure compliance and best 
practice expectations are meet. 31 Octobe r

 9. Key lessons  
9.1. Operational  assessments in a team situation have the potential to alter the normal team 
dynamics.  It is essential that assessments are properly managed and that every team 
member is clear on their responsibilities and their involvement in the assessment process.  
9.2. Clear, succinct and short radio communication between ATC  and aircraft is pivotal to safe 
operations .
