- name: Situational Awareness and 'See and Avoid' Principle
  explanation: Situational awareness is crucial for pilots, especially in uncontrolled airspace where they are solely responsible for maintaining safe separation from other aircraft. The 'see and avoid' principle is the primary defense against mid-air collisions in such airspace. In this accident, the pilot of ZK-WAK likely never saw ZK-CBY approaching, and the pilot of ZK-CBY did not see ZK-WAK in time to take action to avoid the collision. This indicates a breakdown in situational awareness and the effectiveness of the 'see and avoid' principle, which is a recurring safety theme in aviation accidents ("the pilot of ZK-WAK would very likely have been looking forward and focusing on preparing to land, not back and to the right" (3.18), "the pilot of ZK-CBY's view of ZK-WAK would have been obscured by the aeroplane's engine cowling" (3.20)).
- name: Non-Standard Procedures and Non-Compliance
  explanation: Non-compliance with established procedures and the adoption of non-standard practices can significantly increase the risk of accidents. In this case, the pilot of ZK-CBY was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, which had become an accepted practice at the aerodrome. This non-compliance was not challenged or reported, leading to its normalization and increasing the risk of an accident for pilots who were not familiar with the ad hoc procedure ("The pilot of ZK-CBY was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, as this was how the pilot had been instructed to join" (4.3), "Local pilots were aware of the non-standard join, which had become accepted practice on the aerodrome" (4.4)).
- name: Radio Communication and Traffic Awareness
  explanation: Effective radio communication is essential for traffic awareness and collision avoidance. In this accident, both pilots made appropriate radio calls, but neither pilot responded to the other's calls, indicating they either did not consider the other aircraft a threat or were not actively listening. This lack of response and the failure to use radio communication to clarify positions or intentions contributed to the collision ("The calls from ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not interfere with any of the other calls and suggest that the two pilots were able to hear radio transmissions from other aircraft" (3.22), "That the calls made by the pilots of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not elicit any response from each other indicates that the pilots either did not consider the other aeroplane to be a threat or they were not actively listening to the content of the calls" (3.24)).
- name: Oversight and Regulatory Compliance
  explanation: The level of regulatory oversight and support for non-certificated aerodromes is less than for certificated aerodromes, leading to potential safety risks. The investigation found that non-compliance with Civil Aviation Rules (CARs) was more prevalent at unattended aerodromes, and there was a lack of communication between regulatory bodies regarding the responsibilities and support required for the safe operation of these aerodromes ("Non-certificated aerodromes and aerodrome managers did not have the same level of regulatory oversight and support as certificated aerodromes" (4.12), "There was no communication between CAA and other regulatory and local bodies as to the responsibilities and support required for the safe operation of unattended aerodromes, their operators and managers" (4.13)).
- name: Pilot Training and Qualifications
  explanation: Adequate pilot training and meeting qualification requirements are fundamental to aviation safety. In this incident, the pilot of ZK-CBY did not meet the flight time requirement for a commercial parachute drop rating, which, while not a direct contributing factor to the collision, highlights the importance of ensuring pilots are fully qualified for the operations they are conducting ("The pilot of ZK-CBY did not meet the flight time requirement for the issue of a commercial parachute drop rating, but this was almost certainly not a contributing cause of the mid-air collision" (4.2)).
- name: Incident Reporting and Safety Culture
  explanation: A robust safety culture includes the willingness to report incidents and manage risks. The under-reporting of incidents at uncontrolled aerodromes and the passive acceptance of non-compliant behavior at Masterton indicate a deficient safety culture. This lack of reporting and acceptance of non-standard practices can lead to an increased risk of accidents, especially for those unfamiliar with local ad hoc procedures ("The passive acceptance of the non-compliant behaviour, the absence of proactive safety reporting and the resistance to adopting an aerodrome SMS indicate that the safety culture at Masterton was deficient" (3.39), "Should a non-compliant action or procedure go unchallenged or be accepted it risks becoming normalised" (3.43)).
