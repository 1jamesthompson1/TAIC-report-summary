No repeat accidents - ever! 
"The principal purpose of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) shall be to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding 
similar occurrences in the future, rather than to ascribe blame to any person." 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , s4 Purpose  
 
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity and 
standing commission of inquiry. We investigate selected maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents that occur in New Zealand or involve New Zealand-registered aircraft or 
vessels.  
Our investigations are for the purpose of avoiding similar accidents in the future. We 
determine and analyse contributing factors, explain circumstances and causes, identify safety 
issues, and make recommendations to improve safety. Our findings cannot be used to 
pursue criminal, civil, or regulatory action. 
At the end of every inquiry, we share all relevant knowledge in a final report. We use our 
information and insight to influence others in the transport sector to improve safety, 
nationally and internationally.

Verbal probability expressions 
For clarity, the Commission uses standardised terminology where possible.  
One example of this standardisation is the terminology used to describe the degree of 
probability (or likelihood) that an event happened, or a condition existed in support of a 
hypothesis. The Commission has adopted this terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and Australian Transport Safety Bureau models. The Commission chose 
these models because of their simplicity, usability, and international use. The Commission 
considers these models reflect its functions. These functions include making findings and 
issuing recommendations based on a wide range of evidence, whether or not that evidence 
would be admissible in a court of law.

 1 Executive summary 
Tuhinga whakarāpopoto 
What happened 
1.1. On Sunday 16 June 2019, Tecnam P2002 ZK-WAK, a microlight two-seater aeroplane, 
was on a short local flight around Masterton with a pilot only on board. At the same 
time, Cessna 185A ZK-CBY, a light aeroplane, was being used for parachuting 
operations over Masterton Aerodrome.  
1.2. At 1112, both aeroplanes were preparing to land back at Masterton Aerodrome when 
they collided. The collision occurred as ZK-WAK was on the final approach to land on 
runway 06, the sealed main runway. Meanwhile ZK-CBY had completed its parachute 
drop and was turning onto the final approach to land on runway 06L, a parallel grass 
runway. ZK-CBY, the faster of the two aeroplanes, struck ZK-WAK's right side as it 
approached from the right and behind. 
1.3. Both pilots were killed in the collision and both aeroplanes were destroyed.  
Why it happened 
1.4. The pilot of ZK-CBY was joining the non-standard right-hand for runway 06L, as this 
was how they had been instructed to join. The pilot of ZK-CBY, as the joining aircraft, 
needed to give way to ZK-WAK, but did not see it in time to avoid the collision. The 
non-standard join was at variance with Civil Aviation Rules (CARs), but had become an 
accepted practice at the aerodrome. A recommendation was made about the need to 
address non-compliance and incident reporting, particularly at unattended 
aerodromes. 
1.5. Both aeroplanes were approaching the runways at the same time. The aerodrome 
chart informed pilots that 'simultaneous operations' were prohibited. However, there 
was no definition of what 'simultaneous operations' were, and as a result there were a 
range of interpretations. A recommendation was made to address this deficiency and 
review aerodrome charts generally to ensure they are relevant and consistent.  
1.6. The Commission has investigated two previous mid-air collisions that have occurred at 
unattended aerodromes - Paraparaumu in February 2008 and Feilding in July 2010. 
The investigation into the Masterton incident identified factors that were common to 
all three mid-air collisions, which included: 
 the collisions occurred at unattended aerodromes 
 each collision involved an aircraft that was re-joining 
 the weather conditions on each occasion were good 
 pilots made appropriate radio calls, updating the location and intentions 
 all the pilots were familiar with the aerodrome and procedures 
 each collision involved a pilot in one of the two aircraft who held a commercial 
pilot licence or higher qualification. 
1.7. As a result, the investigation found safety issues that were common to the three mid-
air collisions, including: 
 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006    pilots not actively listening to the radio calls from other aircraft 
 the adequacy of the training and support of aerodrome managers, especially at 
unattended aerodromes.  
There was insufficient evidence to determine the level of influence that weather, 
familiarity and pilot experience may have played as a common factor. 
1.8. Recommendations  were made to address these deficiencies. 
What we can learn 
1.9. Pilots, regardless of experience, need to maintain an effective lookout and proactively 
listen to the radio calls made from other aircraft. Pilots need to be aware of and 
comply with CARs and follow standard operating procedures. 
1.10. Aerodrome owners and operators, in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA) and WorkSafe New Zealand, need to collectively ensure aerodrome operators 
and aerodrome managers are appropriately trained and supported.  
Who may benefit 
1.11. All pilots, operators, aerodrome operators and aerodrome managers may benefit from 
the findings, recommendations and lessons in this report.

Pārongo pono 
Narrative 
2.1. On the morning of Sunday 16 June 2019, ZK-CBY, a Cessna 185A aeroplane was being 
used for parachuting at Masterton Aerodrome.2 The weather conditions were suitable 
for parachuting with clear skies and little or no wind. The pilot of ZK-CBY completed 
one uneventful flight, taking off at 0944 and dropping a tandem pair and a single 
parachutist over the aerodrome before returning to land on runway 06L3 at 1001. The 
pilot of ZK-CBY then shut down the aeroplane engine to allow time to prepare for the 
next load. 
2.2. At 1047:44,4 the pilot of ZK-CBY, after boarding the second load of parachutists and 
starting the engine, made a call on 119.1 megahertz (MHz), the local radio frequency, 
advising any other local traffic that ZK-CBY was taxiing for runway 06.5 At 1050:17, the 
pilot of ZK-CBY made a second radio call advising they were taking off from runway 
06 and climbing to 13,000 feet (4000 metres) for parachuting over the aerodrome. 
Shortly after, at 1050:29, the pilot and only occupant of ZK-WAK, a Tecnam P2002 
aeroplane, made a radio call on the same local frequency advising traffic it was taxiing 
to runway 06. The pilot of ZK-WRA, a second Tecnam aeroplane, then called advising 
it was operating four nautical miles (8 kilometres) east of the aerodrome at 3000 feet.  
2.3. At 1052:49, the pilot of ZK-WAK called taking off from runway 06 to vacate to the 
north of the aerodrome, returning to Masterton about 10 minutes later (see figure 4). 
The second Tecnam, ZK-WRA, was operating in the runway 06 circuit at this time. 
Between about 1100 and 1104, the pilot of ZK-CBY used the aeroplane's second radio 
to call Ohakea Control and obtain air traffic control clearance to enter the controlled 
airspace and climb to 13,000 feet (4000 metres) over the aerodrome for the drop. At 
1104:12, the pilot of ZK-CBY made a call on the local radio frequency advising "two 
minutes to drop, there will be two canopies over the field".  
2.4. At 1104:37, the pilot of ZK-WAK called downwind for runway 06. Two minutes later the 
pilot called right base for 06. At 1106:54, the pilot of ZK-CBY made a radio call 
reporting "jumpers away, two canopies over the field". The aeroplane then descended 
with the pilot only on board. At 1107:48, the pilot of ZK-WAK called "going around 06, 
remaining in the circuit". 
2.5. At 1109:40, the pilot of ZK-WRA called that it had landed and was taxiing back to the 
aero club. This was immediately followed by a call from ZK-WAK, "Masterton traffic, 
Whisky Alpha Kilo is downwind for runway 06 Masterton". A minute later at 1110:42, 
the pilot of ZK-CBY called "Masterton traffic, Charlie Bravo Yankee, Ponds 3000 feet 
tracking to join right base 06 left". At 1111:53, the pilot of a locally based helicopter 
radioed "joining base 06 right number two behind Charlie Bravo Yankee". The pilot of 
the helicopter had landed south of the Ponds to uplift a student and was following 
 
2 Known locally as Hood Aerodrome, located on the eastern outskirts of Masterton township.  
3 Runways are referenced to the nearest 10° magnetic bearing. Runway 06L was the left runway of three runways 
on a bearing of 060°. The other two runways were identified as 06 (sealed runway) and 06R (right).  
4 Times indicate the commencement of each radio call. 
5 A radio call or broadcast would typically start with "Masterton traffic" followed by aircraft callsign, location and 
intentions.

until the two aeroplanes were very close to each other. 
2.6. At 1112:32, the pilot of ZK-WAK radioed advising "Masterton traffic, Whisky Alpha Kilo 
is on final for runway 06, full stop Masterton". ZK-WAK and ZK-CBY collided 
immediately on completion of this transmission.  
2.7. The pilot of the helicopter reported not hearing the landing call from ZK-WAK, but did 
see the two aeroplanes collide and spiral to the ground. ZK-CBY caught fire as it 
impacted the ground. The pilot of the helicopter landed nearby and, along with 
several witnesses, attempted to assist the occupants. The two pilots suffered fatal 
injuries (see figure 5).

Personnel information 
Pilot of ZK-CBY 
2.8. The pilot of ZK-CBY held a Commercial Pilot Licence (Aeroplane) and a current 'class 1' 
medical certificate valid until 16 January 2020. The pilot was assessed as fit and healthy, 
with no restrictions on the medical certificate or known medical conditions. 
2.9. The pilot started flying training in March 2017, obtaining a Private Pilot Licence 
(Aeroplane) in July 2017 and Commercial Pilot Licence (Aeroplane) in July 2018. In late 
2018, the pilot visited the operator seeking a job. It was agreed that the pilot needed 
to gain experience flying tail-wheeled aeroplanes6 before commencing training as a 
parachute drop pilot.    
2.10. The pilot's logbook recorded that they had returned to Masterton in April 2019 having 
flown nearly eight hours in a PA18 Piper Cub. The operator's senior pilot continued 
the tail-wheel training, flying a further seven hours with the pilot in a DHC1 Chipmunk, 
all at Masterton. 
2.11. On 24 April 2019, the pilot started training on ZK-CBY. The pilot's logbook recorded 
him being issued a type rating on the C185 type of aeroplane on 10 May 2019. On 11 
May 2019, the pilot obtained a rating for 'Parachute Drop Operations' in accordance 
with the requirements of CAR Part 149 - Aviation Recreation Organisations - 
Certification.7 Between instructional flights, the pilot had also flown as an observer 
with the instructor on parachuting drop flights. 
 
6 Most aeroplanes, including all the types the pilot had flown to date, were equipped with a main landing gear 
and nose wheel. Tail-wheeled aeroplanes have distinctly different ground-handling characteristics. 
7 The certificate permitted the pilot to undertake non-commercial parachute drop operations.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   2.12. On 17 May 2019, the pilot completed a competency assessment with a flight examiner 
for the issue of a parachute drop certificate in accordance with the requirements of 
CAR Part 115 - Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations.8 The pilot had 
accrued a total of 272 hours flying at this time, including 108.6 hours as pilot-in-
command. The pilot commenced commercial parachute drop operations the next day. 
2.13. The pilot last flew on 9 June 2019. At the time of the accident, the pilot had accrued a 
total of 288 hours, including 24 hours on the C185 type of aeroplane. The pilot had 
flown 14.6 hours as pilot-in-command on parachute drop operations, completing 30 
parachute drops flights. 
2.14. A review of the pilot's 24 and 72-hour history identified no fatigue issues. The pilot's 
flatmates and fellow workers reported him to be in good health and his usual self on 
the day of the accident.  
2.15. The toxicology results were negative for any performance impairing substances.  
Pilot of ZK-WAK 
2.16. The pilot of ZK-WAK held a valid Microlight Pilot Certificate and a current medical 
certificate. A review of the pilot's medical assessments and general practitioner notes 
identified nothing of relevance to the occurrence.  
2.17. The pilot commenced flying training in October 2016, obtaining an 'intermediate' 
flight certificate in July 2017, an 'advanced local' flight certificate in February 2018 and 
an 'advanced national' flight certificate on 8 February 2019.9 The next flight test for the 
renewal of the certificate was due on 8 February 2020.   
2.18. The pilot's previous flight was on 5 May 2019. At the time of the occurrence the pilot 
had accrued a total of 99 hours, all on the Tecnam P2002 type of aeroplane and all 
flown locally. 
2.19. A review of the pilot's 24 and 72-hour history identified no fatigue issues. The pilot 
was reported to be to be fit and healthy. The purpose of the flight was a short local 
scenic trip. 
2.20.  The toxicology results were negative for any performance impairing substances. 
Aircraft information 
ZK-CBY 
2.21. ZK-CBY was a Cessna 185A Skywagon aeroplane, serial number 0420, manufactured in 
1962. The aeroplane was powered by a Continental IO-520-D132 engine, serial 
number 293393R, driving a three-bladed propeller. The C185 was a high-wing 
aeroplane with fixed landing gear. In its original passenger configuration, the C185 
was capable of carrying six occupants. 
2.22. The operator purchased ZK-CBY in 2001 and made several modifications in 
preparation for parachuting. The modifications included installing a three-bladed 
propeller to reduce noise, adding wing extensions and altering the main door to have 
 
8 The certificate permitted the pilot to undertake commercial parachuting drop operations.  
9 The various certificates are about pilot privileges. Under an 'advanced national' certificate the pilot was 
permitted to carry passengers and fly beyond the confines of the local area. 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 7 >>
 it hinge upward and therefore provide a clear path for parachutists to exit. A foot rail 
was also installed to allow parachutists to gather at the door and exit as a group.  
2.23. ZK-CBY had been issued with a standard category Certificate of Airworthiness, which 
was non-terminating provided the aeroplane was maintained and operated in 
accordance with the relevant operating limitations and manuals. A review of the 
documents for the aeroplane show that it was maintained in accordance with the 
operator's maintenance programme approved by the CAA.  
2.24. The last recorded inspection was a 50-hour inspection completed on 15 March 2019. 
The last annual review of airworthiness was completed on 19 December 2018. At the 
time of the accident on 16 June 2019 the aeroplane had flown a total of 17,531 hours.  
2.25. The engine had been installed new in the aeroplane on 15 October 1996 and had 
completed 3,137 hours since new and 1,307 hours since its last overhaul. The engine 
was fitted with a monitoring system that permitted a pilot to observe cylinder 
temperatures. There were no known or reported technical issues with either the 
aeroplane or the engine. 
2.26. ZK-CBY was fitted with dual radios that permitted the pilot to listen on two radio 
frequencies at the same time, but only talk on one. In early 2019, the operator 
installed an Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), specifically a FLARM (Flight 
Alarm).10 The ACAS was designed to provide an alert to the pilot about other aircraft in 
the proximity. However, to be effective as an ACAS, the opposing aircraft needed to 
be similarly equipped. ZK-WAK was not fitted with an ACAS, nor was it required to be. 
The FLARM also included a tracking facility that recorded the flightpath of ZK-CBY. 
ZK-WAK 
2.27. ZK-WAK was a Costruzioni Aeronautiche Tecnam P2002-JF aeroplane, serial number 
010, constructed in 2004. The Tecnam P2002 is a two-seater, low-wing light aeroplane, 
popular for initial flight training. The aeroplane was powered by a Bombardier ROTAX 
912 S2 engine, serial number 4.923.103, driving a two-bladed Bolly Aviation propeller. 
The aeroplane was fitted with navigation lights, a strobe light and a landing light. 
2.28. ZK-WAK had been issued a flight permit in accordance with CAR Part 103 - Microlight 
Aircraft - Operating Rules. The Tecnam P2002, with a certified maximum take-off 
weight of 450 kilograms, was classified as a 'microlight' aeroplane. CARs required the 
aeroplane to be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance 
schedule and maintenance manual and that 'annual condition inspections' be 
performed. A review of the records for the aeroplane identified some omissions and 
errors, which mainly related to differences between the newly installed electronic flight 
time recorder and the manual recording system that continued to be used. 
Nevertheless, the maintenance documents confirmed the aeroplane was being 
maintained as directed. 
2.29. The last scheduled inspection of ZK-WAK was a flight permit, also known as an annual 
condition inspection, performed on 7 February 2019. At the time of the accident, the 
aeroplane had flown approximately 1680 hours and had about 20 hours to run to the 
next scheduled 100-hour inspection. The technical log for the aeroplane recorded no 
outstanding or relevant technical issues for the aeroplane.  
 
10 FLARM is a lightweight traffic awareness and collision device optimised for light aircraft, including pilotless 
vehicles.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   Communications and recorded data 
2.30. Radio transmissions made on the Masterton Aerodrome local area frequency of 119.1 
MHz were recorded by the aerodrome operator and made available to the 
investigation. The transmissions recorded were of good quality and included those 
made by the pilots of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK as they flew about the local area and re-
joined to land. Recordings of the radio transmissions made by the pilot of ZK-CBY on 
the Ohakea Control frequency of 125.1 MHz during the time the aeroplane was 
operating within controlled airspace were also obtained by the Commission. See 
Appendix 1 for a full transcription of the radio transmissions. 
2.31. The FLARM tracking data from ZK-CBY for the approximately 30 previous flights were 
obtained as part of the investigation. The data provided an accurate record of the 
flightpaths of ZK-CBY from power-up to shut down, including all of the accident flight 
information (see figure 6).   
2.32. Airways New Zealand radar facilities recorded much of the flightpaths of the two 
aeroplanes as they flew about the local area, but the coverage did not extend to lower 
levels. The recordings for ZK-WAK showed the aeroplane flying the downwind leg, but 
ceased at about the time the aeroplane turned and started descending around the 
base leg. The radar recordings for ZK-CBY closely matched the FLARM tracking data 
previously referred to.

 Aerodrome information 
2.33. Masterton Aerodrome, known locally as Hood Aerodrome, was a non-certificated 
aerodrome11 located on the southern boundary of Masterton township. The 
aerodrome was owned and operated by the Masterton District Council (MDC), who 
appointed an aerodrome manager. The manager's primary function was to manage 
operations on the aerodrome, including running aerodrome facilities and liaising with 
aerodrome users and others.  
2.34. The aerodrome chart for Masterton recorded the aerodrome as 364 feet (110 metres) 
above mean sea level. The aerodrome consisted of one bitumen and two grass 
runways aligned 06 or 24, depending on the take-off and landing direction. A fourth 
cross-grass runway, runway 10/28, was also available for use (see figure 7). On the day 
of the accident, the 06 runways were the primary runways in use. 
2.35. The standard circuit pattern in New Zealand is left hand unless the aerodrome chart 
directs a right-hand circuit be flown. The downwind leg of a circuit is to be flown at a 
height of 1000 feet above the aerodrome elevation unless the aerodrome chart directs 
otherwise.  
2.36. At Masterton half the circuits were right-handed, which was to keep traffic away from 
the township and minimise any adverse effects, such as noise. The downwind leg was 
typically flown at 1400 feet above mean sea level to conform to the 1000 feet above 
the aerodrome.  
2.37. The three parallel runways aligned 060° magnetic were identified as either 06L (for 06 
left), 06 (for the centre bitumen runway) and 06R (for 06 right). Runway 06L was a left-
hand circuit, while 06 and 06R were right-hand circuits. The three runways were 
located about 75 metres apart when measured from the centrelines of each runway. 
2.38. Runway 06L was originally located further to the north within a large grassed area. It 
was established to provide a designated runway for local operators, including 
helicopters and the many vintage aircraft based at the aerodrome. The performance 
capabilities of these aircraft meant that they were able to remain clear of the township 
and close to the aerodrome when flying circuits. In about 2003, building development 
near the eastern end of the runway required the runway to be repositioned closer to 
the main 06 bitumen runway. 
2.39. The Masterton Aerodrome chart published by the CAA and current at the time of the 
accident contained numerous notes for pilots when operating at the aerodrome. 
Notes relevant to this occurrence included: 
1. Simultaneous operations on parallel paved and grass runways prohibited. 
2. Northern parallel grass vector 06L/24R restricted to locally based operators only. 
3. NORDO12 movements can take place on any day. 
4. Pilots should avoid the overhead join procedure when parachute operations are in 
progress.13 
 
11 An aerodrome is required to be certificated when it is used for regular international flights or regular air 
transport involving aeroplanes with a seating capacity of greater than 30 passengers. 
12 Non-radio equipped aircraft. 
13 This was emphasised in another note, recommending the standard overhead join be flown except when there 
was parachuting taking place.

 2.40. The aerodrome was located within uncontrolled 'class G' airspace with no air traffic 
control service present. See paragraphs 2.59 to 2.67 about CARs and procedures.  
2.41. The aerodrome was equipped with an Aerodrome and Weather Information Broadcast 
(AWIB) facility. Local weather information, including wind direction and strength, could 
be obtained by transmitting four quick pulses on 132.8 MHz.   
2.42. An aerodrome user group had been established to help coordinate activities on the 
aerodrome and met semi-regularly. Minutes of the group's meetings for the 
preceding two years were reviewed as part of the investigation.  
2.43. The position of chair of the group's committee was held by the owner of Skydive 
Wellington. The group had established an aerodrome safety officer position to assist 
in addressing any safety-related matters. This position was initially filled by a retired 
commercial pilot with extensive local experience. At the time of the 16 June 2019 
accident the MDC had appointed two safety officers on a casual basis. The aerodrome 
manager attended committee meetings in a coordination role, but to avoid any 
potential conflict of interest was never in the position of committee chair.  
2.44. The aerodrome manager at the time of the accident was employed by the MDC in 
February 2016 on a part-time basis, a position previously held by an independent 
contractor. The council provided a job or position description for the role of the 
manager, which was primarily to promote aviation and activities on the aerodrome in 
line with the council's vision. The manager advised there was no formal qualification or 
training for the role. The manager had relied on a handover from the previous 
contractor, attending conferences and training opportunities, networking and their 
aviation background to do the job.14 
2.45. In 2018, the aerodrome manager established an aerodrome safety committee. The 
purpose of the committee was to discuss hazards and issues on the aerodrome and 
determine ways of making improvements. The committee had met on three occasions 
before the accident on 16 June 2019. 
2.46. The aerodrome manager and the safety committee were also collating a documented 
risk management framework, known as a safety management system (SMS), for 
aircraft operations.15 Masterton Aerodrome, as a non-certificated aerodrome, was not 
required to have an approved SMS and the MDC reported there was some opposition 
to adopting one. However, it was agreed by the aerodrome manager and major users 
that an SMS would provide a useful safety tool. Any work on the aerodrome was 
undertaken in accordance with MDC's health and safety policy. 
Site and wreckage information 
2.47. The two aeroplanes collided over sparsely populated farmland, approximately 300 feet 
(90 metres) above the ground. The collision occurred in line with runway 06, 
approximately 1.2 kilometres short of the runway threshold. Pieces of debris from both 
aeroplanes, including propeller fragments, Perspex and other light items, were spread 
over an area of about 200 square metres. The main structures of the two aeroplanes

 Final Report AO-2019-006   had fallen nearly vertically to the ground, approximately 55 metres apart and along a 
row of trees adjacent to a shingle road.    
2.48. ZK-CBY descended through the trees nose first, catching fire as it struck the trees and 
ground. The pilot of the helicopter following ZK-CBY had landed nearby, and using the 
helicopter's fire extinguisher attempted to extinguish the fire, but was unsuccessful. 
The fire destroyed much of the aeroplane, with the exception of the outer sections of 
the wings and tailplane.   
2.49. ZK-WAK struck the ground nose first, causing the fuselage to split open forward of the 
wings. After striking the ground the aeroplane rocked back onto its main wheels and 
tail. There was no fire.  
2.50. The two aeroplanes were examined on-site before the remaining fuel in ZK-WAK was 
drained. The two aeroplanes were then dismantled, where necessary, and removed for 
further examination. 
2.51. The degree of damage sustained by both aeroplanes meant that it was not possible to 
determine the configurations of the two aeroplanes at the time of impact, including 
the position of the landing flaps and aeroplane lighting.  
2.52. Examination of ZK-WAK identified rubber transfer marks on the right side of the cabin 
area, about in line with the aeroplane's seating. Paint transfer was also evident on the 
right upper wing surface, between 1 and 2 metres in from the wingtip. There were 
gouging or dents coincidental with the paint transfer marks. The transfer marks were 
of a pale red or orange colour. This colour matched the colour painted on ZK-CBY. The 
damage on the upper surface of the right wing of ZK-WAK was also consistent with 
the damage sustained by the right wingtip of ZK-CBY (see figure 9).

 Organisational information 
Skydive Wellington 
2.53. ZK-CBY was owned and operated by Sky Sports (NZ) Limited, trading under the name 
of Skydive Wellington (the operator). The operator was established in about 1992 and 
was certificated under CAR Part 115 - Adventure Aviation - Certification and 
Operations. The operator started parachuting flights at Masterton Aerodrome in 2001 
and undertook both commercial and sports jumping. This included tandem jumping, 
involving a tandem master and rider, and solo parachutists. ZK-CBY was the operator's 
only aircraft. 
2.54. The operator's chief executive, who was also the sole director and shareholder, was an 
experienced parachutist and parachute instructor with over 6,000 jumps since 1970. 
The chief executive held no pilot qualifications, and so piloting-related matters were 
usually delegated to the operator's regular pilot (the instructor) who held an instructor 
qualification.  
2.55. The instructor undertook aeroplane type training for the operator and parachute drop 
ratings for the Part 149 approved New Zealand Parachute Industry Association. For the 
jump training of the pilot of ZK-CBY, the pilot accompanied the instructor as observer 
on about 15 parachuting flights before they started flying with parachutists.16  
2.56. At the time of the accident, the operator was working towards implementing an SMS, 
to update and replace their current organisational management and quality assurance 
systems. However, this was still in draft form and had yet to be submitted to the CAA 
for approval in the agreed timeframe, which was 1 February 2021 (some 19 months 
after the accident). 
Wairarapa and Ruahine Aero Club 
2.57. ZK-WAK was owned and operated by the Wairarapa and Ruahine Aero Club, more 
commonly known as the Wairarapa Aero Club. The club owned two Tecnam P2002 
aeroplanes, ZK-WAK and ZK-WRA. The club operated under a CAR Part - 149 Aviation 
Recreation Organisation, where club members could hire an aeroplane for a private 
flight. 
2.58. The club ran an online booking system, where members could pre-book an aeroplane. 
Depending on the member's experience and qualifications, a booking may have 
needed the approval of one of the club's instructors. The pilot of ZK-WAK had pre-
booked the aeroplane online in accordance with the club's procedures and was 
permitted to undertake the flight. 
Civil Aviation rules and procedures 
Rules 
2.59. Rules on 'right-of-way' and 'operating on and in the vicinity of an aerodrome' were 
contained in CAR Part 91 - General Operating and Flight Rules.17   
 
16 During parachuting operations, the second pilot's seat had to be removed to provide a clear path for 
parachutists to exit the aeroplane. 
17 Part 91 was amended on 10 May 2019, but none of the changes affected the CARs referred to in this section of 
the report. 
 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   2.60. CAR 91.127 - Use of aerodromes - detailed the conditions on the use of an 
aerodrome and included the requirement to comply with notified limitations and 
operational conditions.  
2.61. CAR 91.223 - Operating on and in the vicinity of an aerodrome - directed pilots to 
observe other aerodrome traffic for the purpose of avoiding a collision and to 
conform with or avoid the traffic circuit formed by other aircraft. A pilot was to 
perform a left-hand circuit when approaching to land unless the published landing 
chart directed a right-hand circuit. 
2.62. CAR 91.227 - Operating near other aircraft - directed that no pilot was to operate an 
aircraft so close to another aircraft as to create a collision hazard. 
2.63. CAR 91.229 - Right-of-way rule - directed all pilots, when weather conditions 
permitted, to maintain a visual lookout so as to 'see and avoid' other aircraft. The pilot 
of an aircraft that is obliged to give way to another aircraft must avoid passing over, 
under, or in front of the other aircraft unless well clear.  
2.64. CAR 91.229 - described various situations where a collision might occur, including 
overtaking and landing. The pilot of an aircraft overtaking another aircraft must avoid 
that aircraft. An aircraft on final approach had priority. 
2.65. See Appendix 2 for the full text of the relevant CARs.  
Joining procedures 
2.66. The joining procedures to be followed at aerodromes in New Zealand were contained 
in the Aeronautical Information Publication New Zealand (AIP). Some aerodromes 
around New Zealand, mainly those with an air traffic service, had specific joining 
procedures for pilots to follow, but most uncontrolled aerodromes did not.18 Unless 
stated otherwise, a pilot could therefore join an aerodrome via any part of the circuit, 
including the downwind, base or final approach, provided it complied with CAR 91.223 
(see figure 10).  
2.67. Where a pilot was unfamiliar with an aerodrome or unsure about the conditions, they 
could join via a standard overhead join. The CAA Flight Instructor Guide stated that 
"The standard overhead join procedure is a recommended means of complying with 
this rule…", referring to CAR 91.223 (CAA, 2021). The AIP included similar directions. 
 
18 Exceptions generally included those uncontrolled aerodromes where parachuting took place, for example 
Taupo.

Mid-air collisions 
2.68. The Commission has investigated two other fatal mid-air collisions since 2008. On 
both occasions the collisions occurred over or near non-certificated aerodromes.  
Paraparaumu, 17 February 2008 
2.69. On 17 February 2008, a light aeroplane and a small helicopter collided over 
Paraparaumu Aerodrome. A student pilot in the aeroplane and an instructor and 
student pilot in the helicopter were all killed.19  
2.70. The pilot of the aeroplane was following a standard joining procedure for a sealed 
runway that took it into the path of the helicopter, which was operating in an 
opposing circuit direction for a parallel grass runway. The investigation determined 
that the three pilots had probably been concentrating on flying their aircraft and 
planned manoeuvres to the detriment of listening and maintaining an effective 
lookout. The pilots of both aircraft had made appropriate radio calls that should have 
alerted the other as to their position and intended flightpath, but none of them 
responded to the other's call and none appeared to take any avoiding action.  
2.71. The Commission made a number of recommendations to the CAA to improve safety, 
including the need to monitor operations at non-certificated aerodromes, the need for 
effective visual scanning and active listening, and to review operations at other 
aerodromes around New Zealand that have opposing circuits.20

 Final Report AO-2019-006   Feilding, 26 July 2010 
2.72. On 26 July 2010, two light aeroplanes collided near Feilding Aerodrome. An instructor 
and a student in one of the aeroplanes were killed, while a student pilot in the second 
aeroplane managed to make an emergency landing onto the side of a runway.21  
2.73. The instructor and student were practising a joining procedure when their aeroplane 
collided with the second aeroplane that was in the process of departing to a training 
area. The investigation determined that the pilots of the two aeroplanes had made the 
appropriate radio calls announcing their locations and intended flightpaths. However, 
the pilots appeared not to have comprehended the relevance and importance of the 
other's calls and did not take appropriate action in time to avoid the collision.    
2.74. The Commission made a number of recommendations to the CAA to improve safety, 
including educating pilots on the importance and limitations of the principle of 'see 
and avoid' as a final defence against a collision and of radio calls, both transmitting 
and listening.  
2.75. The two reports detailed above made reference to 12 previous mid-air collisions that 
had occurred in New Zealand in the preceding 20 years and to several overseas 
studies. See Appendix 3 for relevant extracts from the reports into the two mid-air 
collisions and recommendations made as a result.  
CAA and WorkSafe New Zealand  
2.76. Masterton Aerodrome was a non-certificated aerodrome, which was therefore not 
subject to the same regulatory and auditing oversight of certificated aerodromes. On 
30 October 2020, in response to questions posed by the Commission, the CAA advised 
by letter that a: 
…risk-based approach is an inherent feature of [the] New Zealand's aviation safety 
regulatory system. It is also articulated in the CAA's Regulatory Operating Model; a 
model that recognises regulatory resources are not unlimited and must be deployed 
in a risk-based approach in which the nature of the aviation activity conducted and 
the impact on any third parties of safety failure will inform the type and level of 
oversight. 
2.77. Further, the CAA advised that it was the designated agency "only22 for aircraft in 
operation", and "That 'WorkSafe [New Zealand] is the primary regulator for 
aerodromes under the HSWA" (Health and Safety at Work Act 2015). They also 
advised that "Nothing in the designation serves to detract from the primacy of 
WorkSafe as the lead regulatory agency for aerodromes as a Person Conducting a 
Business or Undertaking (PCBU) under their HSWA obligations". 
2.78. While WorkSafe New Zealand was New Zealand's primary workplace health and safety 
regulator, CAA had, under Prime Ministerial designation, been designated with limited 
health and safety functions for the civil aviation system. CAA's jurisdiction covered: 
 work preparing aircraft for imminent flight 
 work on board an aircraft for the purpose of imminent flight or while in 
operation

<< Page 19 >>
  aircraft as workplaces while in operation. 
2.79. For the purposes of CAA's health and safety regulatory function, "in operation" means 
while the aircraft is taxiing, taking off, flying or landing. CAA had further defined this 
to mean from the moment of initial movement of the aircraft until the aircraft fully 
ceases movement, the intent of the pilot being that the operation has ended.  
2.80. WorkSafe New Zealand is the workplace health and safety regulator for the aviation 
sector in all other circumstances. This would include the health and safety practices 
associated with the operation and management of the aerodrome by MDC.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   3 Analysis 
Tātaritanga 
Introduction 
3.1. A pilot is ultimately responsible for ensuring the safety of their aircraft.23 24 To help 
achieve this a pilot needs to build and maintain a mental picture or model of the 
surrounding world to help identify potential threats and choose the most effective and 
safest course of action, which has often been termed 'maintaining situational 
awareness'. The need to maintain this is especially important in uncontrolled airspace 
where a pilot does not have the direct support of an air traffic controller. A pilot is 
therefore solely responsible for ensuring that a safe separation from other aircraft is 
maintained. 
3.2. This accident occurred in a 'class G' uncontrolled airspace. Therefore the 'see and 
avoid' principle was both the primary and final defence in preventing a mid-air 
collision. To assist with this, pilots would follow the rules and approved procedures. 
They would also make radio broadcasts on the local area frequency, stating their 
position and intentions. However, not all aircraft are fitted with radios, nor were they 
required to be.  
3.3. In this accident, the pilot of ZK-WAK very likely never saw ZK-CBY approaching from 
the right and behind, while the pilot of ZK-CBY did not see ZK-WAK in sufficient time 
to take action and avoid a collision. 
3.4. The following section analyses the circumstances surrounding the accident to identify 
those factors which increased the likelihood of the mid-air collision occurring. The 
analysis also examines the occurrence regarding previous mid-air collisions that 
displayed significant similarities, and any safety issues which have the potential to 
adversely affect future operations.  
3.5. Four safety issues were identified as a result and these are described below. 
What happened 
3.6. On Sunday 16 June 2019, the pilot of ZK-WAK had just completed a short local scenic 
flight and returned to Masterton Aerodrome to operate in the right-hand 06 runway 
circuit. At 1112, the aeroplane was on a final approach to land. 
3.7. At the same time, the pilot of ZK-CBY was re-joining to land on the left-hand 06L 
runway, having previously released some parachutists overhead of the aerodrome. The 
re-join was in a non-standard right-hand direction, as this was how the pilot of ZK-
CBY had been instructed to join during their training (see figure 11).  
3.8. As ZK-CBY flew around the base leg, ZK-WAK would have been in front of and below 
ZK-CBY. The pilot's view of ZK-WAK would therefore have very likely  been obscured 
by ZK-CBY's engine cowling. As both aeroplanes approached their respective runways, 
ZK-CBY flying at an approach speed estimated to be at least 50 knots (90 kilometres 
per hour) faster than that of a Tecnam, rapidly closed-in on ZK-WAK. With ZK-CBY 
banked to the right as it turned to line up with runway 06L, its right wheel and right

 wing struck the right side of the cockpit and right wing, respectively, of ZK-WAK (see 
figure 12). The two aeroplanes collided heavily and initially tangled before separating 
and spiralling to the ground. 
3.9. The two pilots were killed in the collision. 
3.10. The investigation found that both pilots were fit and healthy, and fatigue was not a 
factor. The weather, fine and calm with nearly unlimited visibility, was also not a 
factor.25 Both aeroplanes were in an airworthy condition and no mechanical issues 
were identified. The pilots of both aeroplanes had made appropriate radio calls at 
various locations along their flightpaths and should have been able to hear the radio 
transmissions from other aircraft. The failure of a radio receiver in either aeroplane in 
the few minutes leading up to the collision could not be fully excluded. However, this 
was considered exceptionally unlikely  in the circumstances. The investigation 
therefore focused on pilot performance and training, operating procedures and 
oversight.

Civil Aviation rules and procedures 
Rules and procedures 
3.11. The pilot of an aircraft joining an aerodrome or circuit is required to conform to the 
established traffic circuit and give way to aircraft that are already operating in that 
circuit.26 On the day of the accident, aircraft at Masterton were using 06 as the 
designated runway. There were three runways aligned on 06 that could be used. Two 
runways, 06 and 06R, were designated as right-hand circuits and the third runway, 06L, 
was a left-hand circuit. Parachuting was also taking place.   
3.12. The pilot of ZK-WAK had re-joined the circuit via the right-hand downwind leg for 
runway 06, the sealed centre runway. This was logical as the pilot had taken off only 
10 minutes before and was returning from northeast of the aerodrome. The pilot was 
therefore familiar with the local conditions and joining almost directly into the 
downwind leg was the most efficient means of doing so. It also avoided flying a 
standard overhead joining procedure that may have conflicted with the parachuting 
taking place. 
3.13. The pilot of ZK-CBY returned via a wide descending right turn to join on a right-base 
leg for runway 06L. This was not in accordance with CARs as runway 06L was a left-
hand circuit.27 To join for 06L and ensure compliance with CARs, the pilot needed to 
remain clear of the 06 and 06R circuits and join via either a wide left base or a long 
final straight-in approach, thereby also remaining clear of any parachutists. The 
possible reasoning for joining via a right base is discussed in paragraph 3.34.

  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 23 >>
 3.14. The pilot of ZK-CBY, as the joining, faster and overtaking aeroplane, needed to give 
way to ZK-WAK as the slower aeroplane on final approach.28 However, this was 
dependent on the pilot of ZK-CBY being aware of ZK-WAK and observing it in 
sufficient time to take avoiding action. This is discussed further in the following 
paragraphs. 
See and avoid 
Seeing other aircraft 
3.15.  The CAA Rules direct pilots to observe other aircraft to avoid a collision. Witness 
observations, weather reports and photographs confirm that the weather conditions at 
the time of the collision were good and there should have been no environmental 
impediment to pilots seeing other aircraft in the circuit area.  
3.16. At 1112, the sun was determined to be 23° above the horizon and on a bearing of 
015° True. As ZK-CBY flew around the base leg, the sun would have been to the front 
of and above the pilot. The pilot was not wearing sunglasses or a ballcap, but the 
aeroplane was equipped with a sun visor that if needed the pilot could have used to 
reduce any downward glare. Further, as the two aeroplanes closed, ZK-WAK was 
below ZK-CBY and so the sun should not have restricted the pilot of ZK-CBY's view in 
this direction. The accuracy with which ZK-CBY was being flown around the base leg 
and positioned to land on 06L suggests the pilot of ZK-CBY had no difficulty looking 
in this direction. 
3.17. ZK-WAK was mainly painted in white, which should have provided a reasonable 
contrast against the generally green background. The pilot of ZK-WAK was reportedly 
trained to have the strobe light on during aeroplane operations. The light was 
controlled by a rocker switch. The damage sustained meant it was not possible to 
confirm the position of the switch prior to the collision, but it was considered very 
likely to have been on. However, a small aircraft on a bright day can still be 
challenging to locate. Knowing where to look, perhaps directed by a radio call, enables 
a pilot to focus their attention in a certain area and increase the likelihood of 
detection. 
3.18. The pilot of ZK-WAK had priority to land and was likely unconcerned about ZK-CBY as 
it was behind ZK-WAK and joining for a different runway. Therefore, as the two 
aeroplanes closed, the pilot of ZK-WAK would very likely  have been looking forward 
and focusing on preparing to land, not back and to the right. There would have been 
no expectation that an aeroplane would approach from the rear quarter. Also, the 
cabin structure of a Tecnam, like most aircraft, would have made it difficult for the 
pilot of ZK-WAK to see out the rear. 
Field of view 
3.19. The engine cowling and propeller of a Cessna 185 type of aeroplane extends some 1.6 
metres in front of the pilot's instrument panel. This limits a pilot's field of view when 
looking forward. Figure 13 shows the 'field of view' chart for the Cessna 185 
aeroplane. The chart is based on the '85th percentile human male'.29   
 
28 CAR 91.229 (d), (e) and (f).  
29 The chart applies to 85% of all males and the pilot would have fitted into this grouping.  
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   3.20. Working back from the known collision point and impact angle, the recorded 
approach path and speed of ZK-CBY and the likely approach speed of ZK-WAK,30 it 
was possible to determine the approximate relative bearings of the two aeroplanes 
leading up to the collision. From this, it was determined to be very likely  that the pilot 
of ZK-CBY's view of ZK-WAK would have been obscured by the aeroplane's engine 
cowling in the approximately 15-20 seconds leading up to the collision.  
3.21. During training, pilots are taught about blind spots and the need to check these areas 
to ensure they are free of potential hazards. This may be by moving the head and 
upper body, or by manoeuvring the aircraft. To assist in locating and identifying other 
aircraft, pilots can also use their radios if fitted.

3.22. In the approximately 25-minute period that ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK were airborne, both 
pilots made the prerequisite radio calls as they flew about the local area and back into 
the circuit. The recorded radio calls were clear and able to be easily heard and 
understood. In the five minutes leading up to the collision there were nine radio calls 
made. Two were from two aircraft transiting through the area. Two were from ZK-
WRA, the second Tecnam, reporting 'finals' and taxiing in. Two were from a helicopter 
operating in the vicinity. The final three calls were made by the pilots of ZK-CBY and 
ZK-WAK. The calls from ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not interfere with any of the other 
calls and suggest that the two pilots were able to hear radio transmissions from other 
aircraft. See Appendix 1. 
3.23. Why the pilot of ZK-WAK called "going round 06 remaining in the circuit" could not be 
determined. It may have been because it was always their intention, they were not 
happy with the approach, or simply a realisation that the preceding downwind call did 
not advise whether it was to be a landing or a touch and go. The subsequent calls 
were appropriate and gave no indication of any concern by the pilot.

 3.24. These radio calls should have alerted the two pilots to each other's location and 
intention. If there are any concerns about another aircraft, a pilot is encouraged to 
challenge or question the pilot of that aircraft.31 For example, by asking them to repeat 
their position report or confirming they have them in sight. That the calls made by the 
pilots of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not elicit any response from each other indicates 
that the pilots either did not consider the other aeroplane to be a threat or they were 
not actively listening to the content of the calls.   
3.25. For the pilot of ZK-WAK, the radio call from ZK-CBY reporting at the Ponds reporting 
point likely indicated to the pilot that this aeroplane was well behind and (as the 
joining aircraft) would keep clear of ZK-WAK. The pilot of ZK-WAK may therefore not 
have considered ZK-CBY to be a threat. 
3.26. For the pilot of ZK-CBY, the downwind radio call from ZK-WAK was made as ZK-CBY 
was still well to the north at about 5000 feet. The pilot of ZK-CBY therefore needed to 
locate ZK-WAK to ensure a safe separation was maintained as both aeroplanes 
approached to land on 06 and 06L.  
3.27. The downwind call by the pilot of ZK-WAK call was immediately preceded by a 
separate call from the club's second Tecnam, ZK-WRA, advising that it had landed and 
was taxiing back to the club. The sequence and timing of these two calls meant that 
the pilot of ZK-CBY should not have mistaken ZK-WRA for ZK-WAK. The downwind 
call from ZK-WAK should have again alerted the pilot of ZK-CBY to be aware there was 
an aircraft ahead. 
3.28. ZK-WRA and ZK-WAK, pronounced over the radio as Whisky Romeo Alpha and 
Whisky Alpha Kilo, were similar callsigns. However, while confusion on behalf of the 
pilot of ZK-CBY about the position and intended flightpaths of the two Tecnams 
cannot be fully discounted, it was considered very unlikely  for a number of reasons, 
including: 
 The aero club and parachuting operator were located close to each other on the 
aerodrome and the pilot of ZK-CBY would very likely  have known there were two 
similarly coloured Tecnams and their callsigns.  
 The voices of the two Tecnam pilots sounded different over the radios. 
 The radio traffic on the aerodrome frequency (nine radio calls spread over the five 
minutes leading up to the collision) meant that the frequency was not busy. The 
nine calls included three from ZK-WAK and two from ZK-WRA. 
 
3.29. The proximity of the two aeroplanes when the 'finals' call from ZK-WAK was made 
gave the pilot of ZK-CBY no time to locate ZK-WAK ( very likely  hidden from view) 
and avoid the collision. 
Technologies for collision avoidance 
3.30. Advances in technology have resulted in the development of electronic systems that 
help alert pilots to the presence and threat posed by other aircraft. These include both 
airborne collision alerting and avoidance systems and ground-based alerting systems 
 
31 This is communicated in a variety of ways, including CARs, pilot licence flight test guides and CAA Vector 
magazine articles. Advisory Circular AC91-9, Radiotelephony Manual states: "If there is doubt that a message 
has been correctly received, a repetition of the message should be requested in full or in part".  
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   such as 'short-term conflict alert'. ZK-CBY was equipped with a FLARM airborne 
alerting system. However, these alerting systems usually require both aircraft to be 
similarly fitted. ZK-WAK was not similarly equipped, nor was it required to be. In 
uncontrolled airspace, aircraft are not required to be fitted with a traffic alerting device 
and they may not even have a radio. Therefore, while these technologies would assist 
in preventing mid-air collisions, the need to 'see and avoid' remains critical. The 
Commission welcomes advances and efforts to implement these technologies as 
widely as possible. 
 
Aerodrome practices 
Safety issue: Non-compliance, unless addressed as soon as practicable, can quickly become 
accepted and normalised, increasing the risk of an accident. 
 
Safety issue: The lack of a definition of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had 
created confusion for pilots. 
 
Non-compliance in the circuit as an accepted practice 
3.31. On the accident flight the pilot of ZK-CBY was re-joining via a right base leg for 
runway 06L when the collision occurred. The pilot had followed the same procedure 
on the earlier flight that morning. This procedure was not in accordance with CAR 
91.223, which stipulated that pilots were to either conform with or avoid the circuit 
established by other aircraft and perform a left-hand circuit for 06L. The pilot 
therefore needed to remain clear of the 06 and 06R circuit patterns.  
3.32. To land on 06L, the pilot could have re-joined either via a wide left base or straight in. 
With parachuting taking place it would not have been safe to re-join via either a 
standard overhead joining procedure or the downwind leg. The notes on the 
aerodrome landing chart reflected this. 
3.33. A review of the FLARM tracking data for ZK-CBY showed that the pilot of ZK-CBY 
would return via the Ponds reporting point, regardless of the runway in use. The data 
showed that when the 06 runways were in use, it had become routine practice for the 
pilot to take-off on 0632 and land on 06L on some six occasions since 8 June.33 All 
other flights had landed on runway 24.   
3.34. The pilot had been taught during training to re-join via the Ponds reporting point and, 
when 06 was in use, to join right base and land on 06L. This informal practice dated as 
far back as 2015 or 2016. It was reported to Commission investigators that an 
experienced and long-time local pilot had recommended to the then parachute drop 
pilots to re-join via right base for 06L. This procedure offered several advantages, 
including: 
 'the Ponds' was a well-known and obvious location and reporting point that 
suited the descent profile of the parachuting aeroplane for both runways  
 it avoided flying near the township, thereby minimising noise nuisance  
 
32 The aeroplane would be heavier and so the longer runway was required. 
33 Two earlier flights on 18 May, the pilot's first day of commercial dropping, landed on 06R. 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 27 >>
  it was easier to land a tail-wheeled aeroplane on grass34 
 landing on grass resulted in less wear on the tyres  
 it was closer to the operator's base and avoided having to cross other active 
runways after landing 
 it avoided two aircraft being 'belly up'35 to each other as they turned onto 
finals, making it more difficult to see the opposing aircraft. 
3.35. This non-standard procedure was then adopted by the operator's pilots and passed 
onto any new pilots who joined. The operator-owner was aware ZK-CBY was being 
landed on 06L, but was not a pilot and therefore not aware the procedure was in 
conflict with CARs. The operator-owner instead relied on the company's pilots to 
manage the flying side of the business. 
3.36. Interviews of current and former local pilots at Masterton confirmed that the non-
standard procedure flown by ZK-CBY, and sometimes other aircraft, had become an 
accepted routine practice at Masterton. The interviews included many experienced 
local pilots of long-standing, aerodrome personnel, and current and former CAA staff 
who flew at Masterton. 
3.37. A review of the aerodrome's user group records going back five years and the safety 
committee meeting minutes found no reference to the non-standard joining 
procedure. The CAA's incident data base also identified no incidents, complaints or 
reference to the non-standard procedure.  
3.38. Safety culture is an expression of how safety is perceived, valued and prioritised at all 
levels within an organisation (including an aerodrome environment) and reflects the 
extent to which individuals, and groups are committed to safety.36 Fostering an 
environment where there is a willingness to report and manage risks to safety is an 
essential component of a healthy safety culture.  
3.39. The passive acceptance of the non-compliant behaviour, the absence of proactive 
safety reporting and the resistance to adopting an aerodrome SMS indicate that the 
safety culture at Masterton was deficient. 
Identification of non-compliant behaviours 
3.40. Further to the questioning about circuit behaviours, a sample of flight examiners, chief 
flying instructors and senior pilots from around the country were contacted to 
determine if routine non-compliance at aerodromes was a wider issue than just 
Masterton. Most of those contacted confirmed that non-compliance was not unusual 
and was almost solely confined to unattended aerodromes - those without an air 
traffic service in attendance. 
3.41. This general non-compliance at unattended aerodromes is understandable. When an 
incident occurs at an attended aerodrome there would usually be at least three parties 
present, one being a controller or possibly an aerodrome flight information service 
person.37 It was therefore less likely that the incident would be ignored or hidden. 
 
34 A grass surface was better for directional control, especially for low-time pilots still learning to handle the 
unique characteristics of a tail-wheeled aeroplane. 
35 Having the underside of an aircraft facing the opposing traffic, thus limiting a pilot's view in this direction.

<< Page 28 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   Whereas, at a small unattended aerodrome the pilot(s) involved may not wish to 
officially report an incident for whatever reason. Also, at an unattended aerodrome, if 
the incident was a near collision one or both of the pilots may never have seen the 
opposing aircraft and might not be aware of how close they had come. 
Incident reporting 
3.42. Following the Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions, the CAA commissioned a 
review of joining procedures at uncontrolled aerodromes.38 The review found, among 
other things, that: 
…there is significant under-reporting of incidents at uncontrolled aerodromes. 
Anecdotally, the level of under-reporting appears to be in the order of only 1-in-5 to 
1-in-10 incidents are reported, with the extent of under-reporting varying across 
aerodromes.  
This was evidenced at Paraparaumu Aerodrome where a flight information service was 
established following the mid-air collision there in February 2008. The incident 
reporting rates increased significantly, despite the traffic levels remaining about the 
same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3.43. Should a non-compliant action or procedure go unchallenged or be accepted it risks 
becoming normalised. This may suit local operators who are aware of the non-
compliance and modify their actions to accommodate it. However, it may also increase 
the risk of an accident, especially for those unfamiliar with the ad hoc procedure. Were 
a new non-standard action or procedure to be identified that might offer some 
benefit, then it needs to be considered by the appropriate parties and a risk benefit 
review undertaken. If accepted, it might then be added to the notes for all users to be 
informed. An example of this was the note on the Masterton landing chart that 
overhead joins were to be avoided when parachuting was taking place.   
Simultaneous operations  
3.44. The two aeroplanes were on final approach to land when they collided 1 kilometre 
from the threshold or start of the runways. The aerodrome chart included a note 
stating that "Simultaneous operations on parallel paved and grass runways 
prohibited".  
3.45. Interviews of local pilots provided different interpretations of what simultaneous 
operations meant. Responses ranged from not allowed to be side-by-side with 
another aircraft to not allowed to cross the threshold of a runway until the other 
aircraft had cleared the far end of a runway. 
3.46. CAA documents did provide some guidance. However, most of this related to parallel 
runways at controlled aerodromes and involved aircraft landing under instrument 
flight rules. There was no guidance material that related to parallel runways at 
uncontrolled aerodromes, such as Masterton. Early editions of the CAA's Aeronautical 
  
 
38 Review of Joining Procedures at Uncontrolled Aerodromes, Aviation Safety Management Systems Ltd, 2 July 
2013. 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 29 >>
 Information Publication (AIP) - Planning Manual did provide a definition which stated: 
Simultaneous operations 
Two or more aircraft operating from parallel runways, taking off and/or landing at the 
same time. In this context take-off is from the start of the take-off roll to becoming 
airborne, and landing is from touchdown to completion of the landing roll. 
 However, with the digitisation of the AIP in about 1999, this definition was removed. 
3.47. Had there been a clear definition that was understood by pilots, and if the pilots of 
ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK had been aware of each other, the pilot of ZK-CBY may have 
been more alert to ensuring the required spacing with ZK-WAK was maintained. 
Landing charts 
3.48. The investigation found that when reviewing the aerodrome charts for a range of 
aerodromes, many of the charts used different terms and did not accurately reflect the 
current status of the information referred to. For example, parachuting operations may 
have ceased or moved location on the aerodrome.  
3.49. The CAA advised that a comprehensive review of all aerodrome charts was to be 
undertaken to ensure they were both consistent and current as far as practicable. 
Mid-air collisions 
Safety issue: The defence of 'see and avoid' is not foolproof against mid-air collisions and, 
despite repeated efforts to educate pilots about safety around aerodromes, these types of 
accidents continue to occur. 
 
3.50. The mid-air collision at Masterton on 16 June 2019 was the third such collision at an 
unattended aerodrome that the Commission has investigated since 2008.  
Common factors 
3.51. The three mid-air collisions share some common factors, including: 
 the collisions occurred at unattended aerodromes 
 each collision involved an aircraft that was re-joining 
 the weather conditions on each occasion were good, with little or no cloud and 
near unlimited visibility 
 on each occasion the pilots had made the appropriate radio calls, which should 
have been heard by the pilot(s) of the opposing aircraft 
 all the pilots were familiar with the aerodrome and procedures 
 one of the pilots involved in each of the collisions held a commercial pilot 
licence or higher qualification.  
3.52. The Commission's Paraparaumu report made reference to several international 
studies. These studies identified similar common factors, such as that most of the 
collisions occurred at small aerodromes in good weather conditions and involved 
pilots with a wide range of experiences. See Citations on 
<< page 48 >>
 for the list of 
references. 
 

<< Page 30 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   3.53. Following the 2008 Paraparaumu mid-air collision, the Commission conducted a 
review of mid-air collisions in New Zealand. It found that none of the 12 collisions that 
had occurred over the preceding 20 years had done so in controlled airspace. Five of 
the collisions had occurred on or near an aerodrome and the 2010 mid-air collision at 
Feilding was no different.  
Joining an aerodrome 
3.54. The international studies into mid-air collisions found that they mostly occurred in or 
near the circuit. This was consistent with New Zealand's relatively small sampling and 
was not surprising. Aerodromes are where there is a greater concentration of aircraft, 
increasing the risk of a mid-air collision. This is even more so at non-certificated and 
unattended aerodromes where there is no controller present to oversee and ensure 
the safe, orderly flow of traffic. 
3.55. The joining procedure is an area of potentially higher workload for a pilot. A pilot 
needs to assess the aerodrome and runway conditions, complete aircraft checks, make 
radio calls, locate other traffic and manoeuvre the aircraft to fit in with the traffic. At 
unattended aerodromes, this may include non-radio equipped aircraft. A note in the 
Masterton landing chart made reference to non-radio equipped aircraft using the 
large grassed area adjacent to runway 06L.  
 
Weather 
3.56. The prevailing weather conditions for the three mid-air collisions were good and so 
there was no obvious impediment to sighting the opposing aircraft as they flew about 
the aerodromes. However, bright, fine conditions can mean that aircraft navigation 
lights and anti-collision beacons may be less conspicuous when compared to duller 
conditions. Pilots therefore need to be equally alert to sighting other traffic in both 
good and bad weather conditions. For the three New Zealand mid-air collisions there 
was insufficient evidence to determine the level of influence the good weather 
conditions may have played. 
Radio calls 
3.57. The pilots in the three mid-air collisions all made the required radio call leading up to 
the collisions. The transmitting of a radio call stating aircraft identification, position 
and intentions helps other pilots maintain a good mental picture or situational 
awareness of where other aircraft are and what they are doing. It therefore assists with 
'see and avoid'.  
3.58. Pilots may, however, think that having made their pre-requisite radio call they have 
informed other traffic and can therefore relax. When a radio call is made, pilots need 
to immediately give it their full attention to determine its relevance and respond 
appropriately. Should a pilot continue to be unsure about another aircraft, either 
about its position or intentions, they can use the radio to address these issues and 
manage any potential risk. 
Familiarity  
3.59. All seven of the pilots involved in the three collisions were familiar with the applicable 
aerodrome and its procedures. For six of the pilots it was their home base and the 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 31 >>
 aerodrome they did most, if not all, of their flying from. They therefore had a level of 
familiarity with the local environment and were likely comfortable in it. However, like 
the effect of weather, there was insufficient evidence to qualify the effect this might 
have had in each of the three collisions. 
Pilot experience 
3.60. Each of the three collisions involved both students or pilots with low experience and 
pilots holding a commercial pilot licence. Two of the commercial pilots held instructor 
qualifications. This was in line with the international studies that showed that mid-air 
collisions were not experience dependent. Even high-time and highly qualified pilots 
are having mid-air collisions.   
 
Safety at unattended aerodromes 
Safety issue: Aerodrome managers, in particular those at unattended aerodromes, lacked the 
guidance and understanding of their roles and accountabilities regarding the CARs and the 
Health and Safety at Work regulations, which was necessary to be able to discharge their 
responsibilities and ensure the safe operation of their aerodrome.  
3.61. The Commission's investigation into this and previous mid-air collisions identified a 
lack of guidance and support to aerodrome managers on how to safely operate 
unattended aerodromes. This was initially highlighted in the Commission's report into 
the Paraparaumu accident, which had recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation 
that CAA staff "monitor aerodromes, particularly non-certificated aerodromes, to 
ensure safety efforts are best directed to promote the coordinated safe management 
of flying activities".  
3.62. In response to the recommendation, the Director of Civil Aviation replied that: 
As advised in previous correspondence, as Director of Civil Aviation I have limited regulatory 
powers with respect to non-certificated aerodromes. 
Within the resources available to it, the CAA directs its attention to those aerodromes where 
risk is assessed as being highest - in this case to certificated aerodromes and non-certificated 
aerodromes engaged in regular passenger transport operations using 19-seat or more aircraft. 
The CAA does not have the resources available to it to monitor all aerodromes 'equally'. 
However, CAA staff (e.g., aviation safety advisers, etc), actively engage with aerodrome users 
and others to identify risks and associated mitigations. 
Consequently, I accept the recommendation in principle, with the caveat that the CAA's 
actions and engagement are driven by: 
 Assessment of risk; and 
 Targeting resources to areas of highest risk. 
This is the CAA's current practice, which will continue. 
3.63. Under CARs, the operators of non-certificated aerodromes were only required to 
establish procedures to ensure the safe movement of aircraft "on parts of an 
aerodrome where an unsafe condition exists" and monitor and report "traffic 
movement data" for the aerodrome. As a result, CAA oversight of aerodromes was 
often limited to non-regular visits by aviation safety advisors and possibly other staff. 
Certificated aerodrome operators by comparison were subject to greater regulatory 
direction and interaction with the CAA, for example regular audits.  
 

<< Page 32 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   3.64. On 1 October 2020, the Commission wrote to the CAA seeking an update on the 
CAA's role regarding non-certificated aerodromes and the application of the HSWA. 
The CAA replied, in part, that: 
…a risk-based approach is an inherent feature of New Zealand's aviation safety regulatory 
system. It is also articulated in the CAA's Regulatory Operating Model; a model that 
recognises regulatory resources are not unlimited and must be deployed in a risk-based 
approach in which the nature of aviation activity conducted and the impact on any third parties 
of safety failure will inform the type and level of oversight.   
The priority CAA may assign to its oversight of various elements of the aviation sector is 
based on relative risk and not driven by rules or legislation, which are enabling tools.  
The CAA recognises that continued oversight is required for private and recreational activity 
in the civil aviation system but assigns less regulatory resources to this area due to the general 
lower consequences of failure and impact on the safety of third parties. 
3.65. The CAA advised that there was no schedule for visiting non-certificated aerodromes. 
Visits by aviation safety advisors, for example, are generally driven by Aviation Related 
Concerns (ARCs). The CAA advised that an aviation safety advisor had visited the 
aerodrome on 12 occasions in the five years leading up to the accident. Four of the 
visits were for meetings with a specific person or operator and one to attend an 
airshow. The purpose and content of the remaining visits were not recorded. There 
was no record of any meeting with the aerodrome manager or attendance at any of 
the aerodrome user group meetings. 
3.66. The CAA's priority was on higher capacity operations where the risk consequences of 
an accident were potentially far greater. The risk-based approach was heavily reliant 
on the CAA receiving information, for example ARCs, that might generate an increased 
level of engagement. However, because of the under-reporting referred to in 
paragraphs 3.42 and 3.43, the level of risk for unattended aerodromes may be 
significantly higher than suggested by the available information. 
3.67. Despite the overlap of HSWA responsibilities between the CAA and WorkSafe New 
Zealand about the ground and air operations in an aerodrome, the two organisations 
had no coordinated approach in this area. WorkSafe New Zealand advised that its 
engagement with aerodromes was limited to post-accident investigations only. There 
was no proactive support of key participants at an aerodrome, in particular for 
aerodrome managers. 
3.68. Most small unattended aerodromes with low traffic volumes are privately owned. 
Other larger unattended aerodromes with a mix of private and commercial operations 
like Masterton are mainly owned and operated by local councils. Commission 
investigators visited several of these aerodromes to determine if some of the issues 
identified at Masterton were also present elsewhere.  
3.69. Most of the aerodrome managers spoken to did not have an aviation background. In 
some cases, they had been given the role based on their experience managing council 
green spaces. As one manager said, they knew how to grow and cut grass and 
aerodromes typically had a lot of grass.   
3.70. None of the aerodrome managers spoken to had been given any formal training in 
this role. Instead, they either learnt on the job or sought guidance from other 
aerodrome managers. The managers were aware they were required to ensure a safe 
operating area for aircraft and provide the CAA with an annual report of traffic 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 33 >>
 movement data.39 However, the understanding of what this constituted and how it 
was to be presented varied. This suggests a need for associated training and support 
to help ensure the safe operation of their aerodromes. 
3.71. Most managers spoken to were aware of CAA's Advisory Circular, AC139-17-
Aerodrome User Groups, and said that they did have a 'user group' on the aerodrome. 
However, the frequency of meetings and the effectiveness of the groups varied.  
Role of other organisations 
3.72. Commission investigators spoke to WorkSafe New Zealand, NZ Airports Association 
and Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) representatives. The NZ Airports 
Association membership consisted of some 80 members, including about 37 
aerodrome operators. Of this about 10 were non-certificated and unattended 
aerodromes. The chief executive advised that much of the effort was directed to larger 
commercial aerodromes, but they were still concerned about the support and 
management of the smaller aerodromes. Their reach into this area was, however, 
limited given the small number of members from this section of the aviation industry.  
3.73. LGNZ is the representative organisation for all 78 local government councils in New 
Zealand.40 It therefore has the ability, through its membership, to directly connect with 
the owners and managers of aerodromes like Masterton. LGNZ representatives spoken 
to confirmed that LGNZ had had no interaction with the CAA about the support of 
councils and aerodrome managers in the safe operation of aerodromes.  
WorkSafe New Zealand 
3.74. In the CAA's letter dated 30 October 2020, referred to in paragraph 2.76, the CAA 
advised that the CAA's participation in activities on non-certificated aerodromes was 
limited and that "safe aviation practices were actively promoted through visits by CAA 
aviation safety advisers". However, the CAA's interaction with the aerodrome manager, 
the aerodrome user group and other key players at Masterton was sporadic, a 
situation that was repeated at other non-certificated aerodromes around the country.  
3.75. The CAA also commented that WorkSafe New Zealand was "the lead safety regulatory 
agency for aerodromes as a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) 
under their HSWA obligations". The CAA's engagement was therefore effectively 
limited to the operation of aircraft. Some of the aerodrome managers spoken to were 
not aware that under the HSWA they were considered a PCBU. 
3.76. An aerodrome by its very nature involves both aerial and ground activities. It would 
therefore seem logical that both the CAA and WorkSafe New Zealand would engage 
with the various operators or organisations on an aerodrome to help promote safer 
activities taking place on and around an aerodrome.  
3.77. The Commission could find no evidence of any collaborative approach by the CAA and 
WorkSafe New Zealand about aerodromes. WorkSafe New Zealand representatives 
spoken to by the Commission confirmed that the only interaction WorkSafe New 
Zealand had had with aerodromes was to do with regulatory enforcement action. 
WorkSafe New Zealand confirmed that there was the potential for a more proactive 
safety-focused engagement. Logically, this should be done in coordination with the 
 
39 CAR 139.505.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   CAA and potentially involve representative organisations like LGNZ. More formalised 
support for aerodrome managers could also result in improved safety efforts and 
results. 
Pilot qualifications 
3.78. On 11 May 2019, the pilot of ZK-CBY was issued a parachute drop rating in 
accordance with CAR 61.651.41 The Rule required the pilot to hold at least a private 
pilot licence and have accrued at least 200 hours of flight time, including 100 hours as 
pilot-in-command. The pilot's logbook showed that the pilot met this requirement, 
having accrued a total of 270 hours, including 107 hours as pilot-in-command. The 
rating permitted the pilot to perform non-commercial parachute drops.  
3.79. The holder of an adventure aviation operator certificate was required under CAR 
115.55942 to ensure that its pilot(s), including the pilot of ZK-CBY, met the following 
requirements: 
a. hold a current commercial pilot licence,  
b. hold a current parachute drop rating, 
c. hold an aircraft type rating for the type of aircraft to be used, and 
d. acquired at least 150 hours flight time as pilot-in-command of the category of 
aircraft to be used for parachuting.  
3.80. The operator's Operations Manual also stipulated a minimum of "at least 200 hours 
flight time as pilot & at least 150 hours as PIC [pilot-in-command]". 
3.81. The pilot's logbook showed that on 17 May 2019, when undertaking the competency 
assessment check flight to be able to conduct commercial parachuting, they had 
accrued a total of 108.6 hours only as pilot-in-command. At the time of the accident 
that pilot had accrued a total of 288 flight hours, including 123 hours as pilot-in-
command. The pilot of ZK-CBY therefore did not meet the 150-hour 'pilot-in-
command' requirement. 
3.82. The operator, the instructor who did the training and the flight examiner who 
performed the assessment were all aware of the 150-hour requirement. However, they 
were unaware that the pilot did not have the required flight hours at the time of the 
assessment. Both the instructor and examiner contended that the pilot of ZK-CBY, 
while not meeting the hours requirement, was nevertheless competent to perform the 
tasks of a parachute drop pilot. The pilot had completed 28 parachuting drop runs 
before the accident flight.  
3.83. The form used for the parachuting competency assessment did not make provision for 
a pilot's 'pilot-in-command' hours to be recorded, only the total time flown. See Other 
safety actions , paragraph 5.24, for further comment.

 4 Findings 
Ngā kitenge 
Masterton 
4.1. The pilots were both qualified on the aircraft type being flown and the weather 
conditions were suitable for flying. 
4.2. The pilot of ZK-CBY did not meet the flight time requirement for the issue of a 
commercial parachute drop rating, but this was almost certainly  not a contributing 
cause of the mid-air collision. 
4.3. The pilot of ZK-CBY was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, as this was 
how the pilot had been instructed to join. 
4.4. Local pilots were aware of the non-standard join, which had become accepted practice 
on the aerodrome.  
4.5. The pilot of ZK-CBY, as the joining aircraft, was required under the CARs to give way 
to ZK-WAK. 
4.6. The pilot of ZK-CBY did not see ZK-WAK in time to avoid the collision. 
4.7. ZK-CBY struck ZK-WAK on ZK-WAK's right side as ZK-CBY closed from the right-rear 
as it turned onto the final approach to land. The two pilots did not survive the 
collision.  
4.8. The circumstances of the accident, an aircraft joining at an uncontrolled aerodrome, 
were similar to two previous mid-air collisions investigated by the Commission.  
General 
4.9. None of the pilots involved in the three mid-air collisions investigated by the 
Commission made additional calls to assist in locating the other aircraft and avoid the 
collisions.  
4.10. There was wide range of interpretations about what was meant by 'simultaneous 
operations' at aerodromes. 
4.11. The lack of incident reporting and non-compliance with CARs at aerodromes was 
reported as being more prevalent at unattended aerodromes.  
4.12. Non-certificated aerodromes and aerodrome managers did not have the same level of 
regulatory oversight and support as certificated aerodromes.  
4.13. There was no communication between CAA and other regulatory and local bodies as 
to the responsibilities and support required for the safe operation of unattended 
aerodromes, their operators and managers.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   5 Safety issues and remedial action 
Ngā take haumanu me ngā mahi whakatika 
 
General  
5.1. Safety issues are an output from the Commission's analysis. They typically describe a 
system problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide 
scale.  
5.2. Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the 
Commission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.  
 
Safety issues 
Non-compliance, unless addressed as soon as practicable, can quickly become accepted and 
normalised, increasing the risk of an accident 
5.3. The pilot of ZK-CBY did not join the circuit according to the CAA's standard joining 
procedure and as a result followed a similar base leg flightpath to ZK-WAK. The 
flightpaths of the two aeroplanes crossed as ZK-CBY lined up for 06L, the furthest left 
of the three runways. Had the pilot of ZK-CBY followed CARs and joined via a left base 
or long final approach, the flightpaths should not have crossed.43  
5.4. The CARs directed that the pilot of ZK-CBY was required to give way to ZK-WAK. ZK-
CBY was the joining aircraft and was ahead and already in the established circuit 
pattern. For the pilot of ZK-CBY to give way to ZK-WAK, the pilot needed to locate ZK-
WAK to ensure there was adequate separation.  
5.5. The non-standard join had become an accepted procedure since its inception about 
five years before. While the procedure was well intended and known about by local 
pilots, it had created a potential hazard, especially for pilots less familiar with 
Masterton. 
5.6. Anyone can inform the CAA of an aviation-related concern, including via telephone or 
email. Aviation certificate holders, for example pilots and operators, are required 
under CAR Part 12 Accidents, Incidents, and Statistics Aviation, to notify the CAA as 
soon as practicable if they are involved in any incident. The incident needs to be 
serious or an immediate hazard to the safety of an aircraft operation.44      
5.7. Following the accident, the MDC closed runway 06L/24R. This action will prevent an 
aircraft joining non-standard right-hand for 06L and thereby prevent a direct repeat of 
the accident. It will not, however, eliminate the potential for a mid-air collision should 
two aircraft join for the two remaining parallel runways and cross flightpaths on base 
leg or final approach.  
5.8. On 30 July 2019, the MDC emailed a notice to aerodrome users and operators "to 
remind operators to adhere to aerodrome procedures as published…". See Appendix 4 
for the notice. On 10 October 2019, a follow-up notice was issued informing operators 
 
43 Their paths may still have crossed were either aircraft to swing wide around the base turn and cross the 
centreline for the runway they were to land on. 
44 A serious incident means an incident involving circumstances indicating that an accident nearly occurred. 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 37 >>
 of recent changes on the aerodrome and reminding them to adhere to published 
procedures. 
5.9. On 12 August 2019, the CAA issued a 'Safety Message' titled 'Non-conformance with 
uncontrolled or unattended aerodrome circuit procedures can be fatal'. The notice 
reminded pilots of the requirement to comply with the published circuit direction and 
relevant procedures (see figure 14). 
5.10. The Commission welcomes the safety actions to date. However, it believes more action 
needs to be taken to ensure the safety of future operations. Therefore, the 
Commission has made recommendations in section 6 to address these issues.   
 
Figure 14: CAA Safety Message 
 
The lack of a definition of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had created confusion 
for pilots  
 
5.11. The two aeroplanes were approaching the runways at the same time - simultaneously. 
The Masterton Aerodrome chart stated that simultaneous operations were prohibited. 
However, the lack of a clear definition of what 'simultaneous operations' meant had 
resulted in a range of interpretations.   

 

<< Page 38 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   5.12. On 3 May 2022, the CAA advised the Commission that the CAA had "raised an Issue 
Assessment to examine potential issues arising from this mid-air collision as they 
relate to simultaneous runway operations. This assessment will consider whether there 
are any regulatory or guidance issues with the status quo and make recommendations 
for how they might be resolved ." At the time of approving this report, this work was 
still in progress. 
5.13. The Commission welcomes this action but believes further work is required. Therefore, 
the Commission has made a recommendation  in section 6 to address this issue. 
The defence of 'see and avoid' not foolproof against mid-air collisions, and despite repeated 
efforts to educate pilots about safety around aerodromes these types of accidents continue to 
occur. 
5.14. There was no evidence that the pilot of ZK-CBY reacted to the presence of ZK-WAK as 
the two aeroplanes turned right base and approached the runways. While it may have 
been challenging to visually detect ZK-WAK, the radio calls from ZK-WAK should have 
alerted the pilot of ZK-CBY that there was an aircraft ahead that needed to be located 
and avoided. The need to listen and respond appropriately to the radio calls from 
aircraft that may pose a hazard was identified in both the Paraparaumu and Feilding 
mid-air collision investigations. 
5.15. Further, the aerodrome is where there is a greater concentration of aircraft. When 
flying in or about the circuit pilots need to be looking outside the cockpit, assessing 
their flightpath and looking for other aircraft. They also need to minimise looking 
inside the cockpit to the detriment of maintaining an effective scan outside. Should a 
pilot hear the start of a radio transmission from another aircraft, they need to listen 
and determine if it is going to pose a threat. If it is a potential threat, or the pilot is 
unsure, they need to proactively manage the threat.  
5.16. The pilot of the helicopter did not recall hearing the pilot of ZK-WAK report on the 
final approach to land. This is an example of where a pilot may have been distracted 
or subconsciously discounted the radio call as that aircraft did not pose a threat to the 
helicopter and they were concentrating on following ZK-CBY. 
5.17. On 3 May 2022, the CAA advised the Commission: 
The Authority continues to promote the ongoing education of good see and avoid 
practices. In December 2020 the Authority released the new Human Factors page on 
the Civil Aviation Authority and Aviation Security website. The aim of the webpage is 
to support awareness and basic understanding of Human Factors, across the New 
Zealand Aviation Industry. 
 
This resource provides information on several Human Factors topics, across human 
and organisational performance, design and maintenance of human factors, and 
fatigue risk management. 
Identified as two key fundamentals of human factors in aviation, guidance material for 
Threat and Error Management (TEM) and Situational Awareness (SA) were updated in 
December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.  
The guidance material can be found on the Authority website.  
Also, below are some Vector magazine articles that also address the concerns in the 
above recommendation. There are online versions of the magazines which you can 
also find by searching Vector magazine on the Authority website.  
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 39 >>
 Vector magazine articles 
 Spring 2019; Plane talking and situational awareness 
 Summer 2020; Safety in the circuit 
 Summer 2020; Standards Overhead Join 
 Autumn 2021; A Stable Approach 
 Spring 2021; Slow down those radio calls 
 Spring 2021; A Blunt Message (circuit procedures and etiquette).  
5.18. The Commission believes 'see and avoid' remains a critical element of ensuring safety, 
so a recommendation was made in section 6 to address this issue. 
Aerodrome managers, in particular those at unattended aerodromes, lacked the guidance and 
understanding of their roles regarding the CARs and the Health and Safety at Work Act, which 
was necessary to be able to discharge their responsibilities and ensure the safe operation of 
their aerodrome. 
5.19. The mid-air collision at Masterton was the third mid-air collision at an unattended 
aerodrome the Commission has investigated since 2008. Each of the mid-air collisions 
involved locally based pilots or, as in one accident, a pilot who was still very familiar 
with the aerodrome and its procedures. Therefore, there may have been an element of 
familiarity present in each of the accidents, and as a result the pilots letting their guard 
down. However, there was insufficient evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. 
5.20. The absence of an air traffic service presence,45 potentially acting as a third party, is 
reflected in a lower incident reporting rates for unattended aerodromes. The CAA has 
had minimal engagement with non-certificated aerodromes, focusing instead on the 
higher 'risk consequence' of an accident at one of the larger aerodromes. However, as 
a result the risk of a mid-air collision at an unattended aerodrome continues to be 
higher as evidenced by the location of the mid-air collisions. 
5.21. Discussions with aerodrome operators and managers, LGNZ, NZ Airports Association, 
WorkSafe New Zealand and the CAA identified that there was a lack of training and 
support for the managers of non-certificated and unattended aerodromes.   
5.22. WorkSafe New Zealand advised on 3 May 2022 that "a new Memorandum of 
Understanding between WorkSafe and CAA took effect from 6 April 2022. It focuses 
on coordination, collaboration and cooperation between both agencies". 
5.23. The Commission welcomes the safety actions taken in response to the first two 
accidents. However, it believes more action needs to be taken to ensure the safety of 
future operations. Therefore, the Commission has made recommendations  in section 
6 to address these issues. 
 
Other safety actions 
5.24. Participants may take safety actions to address issues that would not usually result in 
the Commission issuing a recommendation. 
5.25. The following safety actions have been taken: 
 
45 A control or flight service. 
 

<< Page 40 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   Masterton District Council (MDC) 
The MDC directed the closure of runway 06L/24R. An updated aerodrome chart was 
issued on 26 March 2020 to reflect the changes. Aircraft, mainly helicopter and 
vintage aeroplanes, were still able to take-off and land on the grass area to the west 
of the main runway. Many of the vintage aeroplanes were unable to land in a 
crosswind and needed to be able to land directly into wind on a grassed area. 
However, as set out in paragraph 5.6, this action will not fully eliminate the potential 
for conflict in the area of the base turn and final approaches.  
The council has also bolstered its incident reporting capability, enabling both direct 
and anonymous reports to be made. Any reports would initially be managed by the 
aerodrome manager with potential feedback to the aerodrome user group 
representatives.  
An aerodrome safety review and a safety survey was undertaken by two 
independent organisations. 
An external health and safety audit was completed. 
Aerodrome inspection procedures were published. 
A draft SMS manual was completed and awaiting MDC approval for 
implementation. 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
On 12 August 2019, the CAA issued a 'Safety Message' to pilots titled 'Non-
conformance with uncontrolled or unattended aerodrome procedures can be fatal'. 
The message emphasised the requirement for pilots to "comply with the published 
circuit directions…". A radio transmission advising "joining or vacating 'non-
standard' is not acceptable…". 
On 22 September 2020, the Commission connected the principal policy advisor for 
LGNZ with the manager aeronautical services for the CAA.  
The CAA advised that it was undertaking a comprehensive review of all aerodrome 
charts to ensure they were both consistent and current as far as practicable. 
On 3 May 2022, the CAA advised the Commission that a 'Good Aviation Practice' 
video on the standard overhead join had been produced and was being presented 
to forums around New Zealand. Feedback was being included in an updated flight 
instructor guide. A second standard overhead join poster had also been published 
for joining right-hand circuits. The video could be found at: 
www.aviation.govt.nz/licensing-and-certification/pilots/flight-training/fixed-wing-
flight-training-safety-strategy/standard-overhead-join/#Standard-overhead-join-

Flight Test New Zealand 
Flight Test New Zealand advised the Commission that the competency assessment 
report form used for the parachuting check flight had since been modified. A flight 
examiner was now required to record a pilot's actual pilot-in-command hours at the 
time of assessment. A copy of the new form was passed to the Commission.

 6 Recommendations   
Ngā tūtohutanga 
 
General  
6.1. The Commission issues recommendations to address safety issues found in its 
investigations. Recommendations may be addressed to organisations or people, and 
can relate to safety issues found within an organisation or within the wider transport 
system that have the potential to contribute to future transport accidents and 
incidents. 
6.2. In the interests of transport safety, it is important that recommendations are 
implemented without delay to help prevent similar accidents or incidents occurring in 
the future.   
New recommendations  
6.3. On 1 September 2022 the Commission recommended that the CAA: 
6.3.1 Use the lessons from this report to educate pilots on some of the 
common factors in mid-air collisions, and in particular the requirement 
to know and apply CARs and to address any non-compliance, as 
appropriate. (012/22)  
6.3.2 Promote ongoing understanding of 'simultaneous operations', including 
a published definition and how the practice relates to parallel runway 
operations at unattended aerodromes. (013/22)  
6.3.3 Improve the effectiveness of 'see and avoid' as a way to avoid mid-air 
collisions through the promotion of the skills required, including the 
need to actively listen to radio calls. (014/22)   
6.3.4 Encourage the reporting of safety-related incidents or concerns, 
especially at unattended aerodromes. (015/22)     
6.3.5 Ensure that managers and users of aerodromes, in particular for 
unattended aerodromes, understand and fulfil their responsibilities for 
ensuring safe operations. This includes: 
a. Facilitating a coordinated approach with WorkSafe New Zealand, 
LGNZ and NZ Airports Association, among others, 
b. Providing training and support to aerodrome operational and 
management personnel, and 
c. Identifying and encouraging aerodrome user group's 
contributions towards aerodrome safety. (016/22) 
 
6.4. In a letter dated 27 September 2022, the CAA responded to the recommendations as         
follows: 
I write in response to your letter dated 13 September 2022, in which you 
provided the Civil Aviation Authority (the Authority) with recommendations of 
the final draft aviation report AO-2019-006. I can confirm that the Authority 
 

<< Page 42 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   will be accepting the recommendations specified in our submission on 3 May 
[response to draft report].  
 
You also asked that if it were practicable, that our letter confirm the dates we 
expect the recommendations to be fully implemented and the likely actions 
taken to address those recommendations. Formulating actions and 
establishing timing can be difficult at this stage so we are unable to provide 
those timings now, however we can provide them in due course.  
 
In an email prior to the 13 September letter, the Commission also queried our 
response to Paragraph Rec. [6.3.2] about 'simultaneous operations', which has 
now been updated to Recommendation 013/22. As noted in our letter on 3 
May, we have raised an Issue Assessment to examine potential issues arising 
from this mid-air collision as they relate to simultaneous runway operations. 
This may produce insight or a solution to what Recommendation 013/22 is 
trying to address.  
 
In addition, the Authority is continuing awareness work around standardised 
procedures at unattended aerodromes during forthcoming Flight Instructor 
seminars. These work-shop sessions reinforce the messaging from the 
Standard Overhead Join videos the Authority have already produced.

 7 Key lessons 
Ngā akoranga matua 
 
7.1. Aviation participants need to know, understand and comply with CARs and 
procedures unless safety directs otherwise, and not accept the normalisation of 
informal practices. 
7.2. To increase the effectiveness of 'see and avoid' as a defence against mid-air collisions, 
pilots need to ensure they actively listen to the radio calls made from other aircraft to 
proactively identify potential threats and mitigate them. 
7.3. Pilots, regardless of experience (flying hours, qualifications and local knowledge), need 
to be aware of the limitations associated with 'see and avoid', particularly in areas 
where aircraft operations are concentrated, such as aerodromes.  
7.4. Aerodrome managers, user groups and operators need to collectively ensure there is a 
coordinated proactive approach to safety at an aerodrome.

 9 Conduct of the inquiry 
He tikanga rapunga 
 
9.1. At about 1145 on 16 June 2019, the Commission was alerted to the occurrence and 
received formal notification from the CAA shortly after. The Commission subsequently 
opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990  and appointed an Investigator-in-Charge. The Investigator-In-
Charge, accompanied by a second investigator, travelled to Masterton that afternoon. 
9.2. The investigators met with Police the next morning and commenced their initial site 
examination. Aircraft wreckage was subsequently relocated to the Commission's 
storage and examination facility for further analysis. 
9.3. Investigators interviewed witnesses and collected pilot, operator and aeroplane-
related documents. 
9.4. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States of America, as 
the representative for the state manufacturer of the Cessna aeroplane, and the 
Agenzia Nazional per la Sicurezza de Volo (ANSV, National Agency for the Safety of 
Flight) of Italy, as the representative for the state manufacturer of the Tecnam, were 
notified of the occurrence. The ANSV was appointed as an accredited representative in 
accordance with Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. A Tecnam 
engineer was appointed as a technical advisor to the ANSV. 
9.5. On 22 February 2022, the Commission approved a draft report for circulation to 10 
interested persons for their comment. The Commission received six responses, two of 
which were joint responses. The remaining two persons were contacted. They advised 
that they had no comment to make. As a result of the responses changes were made 
to the final report. 
9.6. On 1 September 2022, the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 Final Report AO-2019-006   Appendix 3   Mid-air collisions 
Extract: Report 08-001, Cessna 152 ZK-ETY and Robinson R22 ZK-HGV, mid-air 
collision, Paraparaumu, 17 February 2008. 
Review of mid-air collisions 
1.5.1  The CAA reported that there had been 12 mid-air collisions in the previous 20 years, 
including the accident at Paraparaumu on 17 February 2008.47 Six of the collisions had 
resulted in fatalities, with a total of 20 people killed. Six of the collisions had involved some 
form of formation flying or pre-planned close-proximity activity, air-to-air filming for 
example. All the mid-air collisions had occurred in visual meteorological conditions with the 
pilots operating under VFR. 
1.5.2 None of the 12 mid-air collisions had occurred in controlled airspace. Five of the 
collisions had occurred in or near an aerodrome or circuit environment. The Paraparaumu 
accident was the only mid-air collision to involve aircraft operating in a circuit that were not 
part of a formation. 
1.5.3 A review of mid-air collisions in the United States by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) found that all mid-air collisions had occurred in visual meteorological 
conditions where bad weather was not considered a factor.48  The review found that 
"inadequate visual lookout - failure to see and avoid" remained the most common causal 
factor. About 88% of pilots involved in mid-air accidents never saw the opposing aircraft in 
time to take evasive action. Pilot experience was not considered a safeguard, as a third of the 
pilots involved had more than 3000 flying hours experience. 
1.5.4 The failure to see and avoid was not strongly related to high closing speeds between 
converging aircraft. In most cases the closing speeds were low as one aircraft usually struck 
the second from the rear, from above or from a quartering angle, rather than head-on. This 
stemmed from most mid-air collisions occurring in areas of high traffic density, particularly 
near uncontrolled aerodromes. The high traffic congestion also explained why student pilots 
were involved in 36.5% of mid-air collisions, as they spent a significant portion of their 
training in the aerodrome circuit or vacating and later re-joining. The high percentage of 
student involvement also suggested that "instructional pilots may be distracted with 
instruction and not properly monitoring the flight". 
1.5.5 The above analysis was supported by data from the National Transportation Safety 
Board of the United States (NTSB), which showed that 77% of mid-air collisions involved 
arrival at, departure from or flight over an aerodrome. 61% of the mid-air collisions involved 
aircraft in the circuit. 
1.5.6 Following 3 mid-air collisions at major general aviation aerodromes in Australia in 
early 2002, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) conducted a review of mid-air 
collisions that had occurred in the period 1961 to 2003.49  The objectives of the review were 
to identify common characteristics and contributing factors, assess whether the mid-air 
collision rate had changed in recent years, and compare the results with other countries. The 
review made no safety recommendations.

<< Page 55 >>
 1.5.7 The review identified 37 mid-air collisions involving general aviation aircraft, with an 
average of about one collision per year since 1968. Most (78%) mid-air collisions had 
occurred in or near the circuit area, reflecting the higher traffic density identified by the FAA. 
About 41% of the mid-air collisions had occurred at the 5 major general aviation 
aerodromes, but the rate had decreased since the introduction of "General Aviation 
Aerodrome Procedures" in 1980.   
1.5.8 The ATSB review identified no dominant causal factor. Most of the collisions had 
involved one aircraft colliding with another from behind, or both aircraft converging from a 
similar direction. The review determined that the characteristics and contributing factors of 
mid-air collisions were similar to those observed in the United States, France and Canada.    
Safety Recommendations 
5.1 On 17 August 2009 the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation 
that he take action to address the following safety issues, including: 
5.1.1  The need for CAA staff to monitor aerodrome operations, particularly at non-
certificated aerodromes, to ensure safety efforts are best directed to promote 
the coordinated safe management of flying activities. (026/09) 
5.1.2 The need to encourage good aviation practice to help ensure pilots know how 
to perform an effective visual scan and how to actively listen to radio calls. 
(027/09) 
5.1.3 The need to review the operations at other aerodromes around New Zealand 
that have opposing circuits, to assess and minimise the potential for a mid-air 
collision. 
5.2  On 11 September 2009 the Director of Civil Aviation replied: 
5.2.1  As advised in previous correspondence, as Director of Civil Aviation I have 
limited regulatory powers with respect to non-certificated aerodromes.  
Within the resources available to it, the CAA directs its attention to those 
aerodromes where risk is assessed as being highest - in this case to 
certificated aerodromes and non-certificated aerodromes engaged in regular 
passenger transport operations using 19-seat or more aircraft.  
The CAA does not have the resources available to it to monitor all 
aerodromes 'equally'. However, CAA staff (e.g., aviation safety advisers, etc), 
actively engage with aerodrome users and others to identify risks and 
associated mitigations.  
Consequently, I accept the recommendation in principle, with the caveat that 
the CAA's actions and engagement are driven by:  
• Assessment of risk; and  
• Targeting resources to areas of highest risk.  
This is the CAA's current practice, which will continue. (026/09).  
5.2.2 The CAA has a programme of activities designed to encourage good aviation 
practice. Articles have been produced in Vector on visual scanning, and active 
listening (see and be seen). Articles will be re-run in future editions of Vector. 
 

<< Page 56 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   Consideration will also be given to using the AvKiwi seminar series to address the 
issue.  
Consequently, I accept the recommendation, noting that CAA has already undertaken 
'safety promotion' activities on this topic, and will continue to do so in the future as 
part of its ongoing safety promotion programme.  
You can find evidence of the actions taken by CAA on the CAA's website and 
previous editions of Vector. (027/09)  
5.2.3 As for recommendation 026/09, the CAA is constrained by 3 issues: (1) the extent of 
the Director's regulatory powers; (2) the resources available to it; and (3) the nature 
and extent of the risk being targeted.  
As Director, I cannot mandate specific actions for individual aerodromes on the issue 
at the core of the recommendation. However, the Aeronautical Information 
Publication Bulletin Volume 1 AD 1.5 clearly provides advice on the issue of Standard 
Overhead Circuit Joining procedures.  
Consequently, I do not accept the recommendation as written.  
I will undertake to make aerodrome operators aware of the TAIC recommendation, 
and their responsibilities with respect to the formation of aerodrome user 
groups/safety committees.  
I will also undertake to make aerodrome operators aware of the risks associated with 
a 'mix' of operational activities, and their need to develop appropriate local 
procedures to minimise the risk of mid-air collisions.  
CAA Aviation Safety Advisers (ASA's) currently work with a number of aerodromes. 
CAA will look to increase the activity and focus of ASA's as part of its work 
programme to address the underlying issue identified in the investigation report. 
(028/09).

Extract: Inquiry 10-008: Cessna 152 ZK-TOD and Cessna 152 ZK-JGB mid-air collision 
near Feilding, Manawatu, 26 July 2010. 
3.8. Mid-air collisions 
3.8.1. The investigation into the Paraparaumu accident identified 12 mid-air collisions that 
had occurred in New Zealand in the previous 20 years. Seven of the collisions resulted in 
fatalities, with 20 people killed. Half of the collisions involved aircraft participating in some 
form of formation or pre-planned close-proximity activity, for example filming. All of the 
collisions occurred during daylight in good weather conditions with the pilots operating 
under VFR (visual flight rules). The collisions all occurred in uncontrolled airspace and 5 
occurred in or near an aerodrome or circuit environment. The Feilding accident was the sixth 
to occur near an aerodrome.      
3.8.2. Reports into mid-air collisions by the United States Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA,1983), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB, 2004 & 2008), the French Bureau 
d'Enquetes et d' Analyses (BEA, n.d.) and a report by the Canadian Transport Safety Board 
(TSB, 2006), all identified similar characteristics. They found that mid-air collisions occur 
mostly in or near the circuit and in visual meteorological conditions. The Australian study 
determined that in the majority of collisions there was evidence to suggest that the pilots 
involved made appropriate radio broadcasts prior to the collision. The United States review 
determined that "inadequate visual lookout - failure to see and avoid" remained the most 
common causal factor.  About 88% of pilots involved in mid-air accidents had not seen the 
opposing aircraft in time to take evasive action. None of the reports identified a relationship 
between pilot experience and incidence of mid-air collisions.    
3.8.3. The study by BEA of mid-air collisions between 1989 and 1999 concluded "that all 
pilots whatever their age, their qualification or flight rules applied can be confronted with the 
risk of mid-air collision. The number of these accidents is low, but they often have serious 
consequences".  The study also concluded that:  
The increasing number of aircraft, the complexity of certain routes, the improved 
performance and ergonomics of cockpits should incite pilots to use all means available 
in order to detect and to be detected by others.  
Finally, regulatory developments are indispensable because the see-and-avoid rule is 
often the only guarantee of avoiding collision. This basic rule, in a context where there 
are more and more constraints, is no longer adequate. 
3.8.4. In response to questions raised by the Commission about its study, BEA advised that 
there had been no change to the rules since the study and that "the 'see-and-avoid' principle 
remains the basis of collision avoidance for VFR flights, whatever the airspace class. There is 
no expected change to this". BEA also advised that there was no mandatory use of airborne 
collision avoidance systems (ACASs)50 for light aircraft and no plans to change the rules 
regarding separation in uncontrolled airspace.  
3.8.5. In respect of joining an uncontrolled aerodrome, BEA advised that 'the regulations 
require the pilot to evaluate the parameters at a height above the circuit height, then to 
enter the circuit at the beginning of the downwind leg.' Other than meeting these 
 
50 ACASs come in many forms, from a simple alerting system that warns a pilot to the presence of another aircraft, 
to more sophisticated equipment that provides traffic location and, if required, avoiding action to follow. 
 

<< Page 58 >>
 Final Report AO-2019-006   requirements there was no standardised procedure or prescribed height above the circuit for 
the overhead join.   
3.8.6. On 3 June 2010, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority introduced new 
procedures for operations at non-towered aerodromes. The changes were "aimed at 
reducing the risk of mid-air collisions by maximising separation at aerodromes without air 
traffic services" (CASA, 2010). The changes included the requirement to carry and use a radio 
when flying at or in the vicinity of a certified, registered or military aerodrome that was non-
towered.51 Non-towered aerodromes by definition were located in uncontrolled class G 
airspace. 
3.8.7. The new procedures prescribed different circuit heights for different aircraft types; 
1500 feet for high performance aircraft, 1000 feet for medium performance aircraft, and 500 
feet for low performance aircraft. The requirement to make radio broadcasts at specific 
locations within the circuit, and when joining or flying near an aerodrome, was also 
prescribed. 
3.8.8. Pilots were recommended to join the circuit on the downwind leg, either from an 
extension of the downwind leg, a 45° angle about halfway down downwind, or from a 
shortened crosswind leg. Joining straight in on a long final approach was allowed but not 
recommended. If unfamiliar with the aerodrome layout, circuit direction or conditions, pilots 
were recommended to overfly or circle it at least 500 feet above circuit altitude. Pilots were 
to descend on the non-active (dead) side of the circuit when satisfied of the conditions. This 
manoeuvre was similar to the CAA promoted standard overhead joining procedure. 
Recommendations 
8.3 On 12 February 2013, the Commission made the following recommendations to the 
Director of Civil Aviation. 
8.3.1.  The Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions both involved instructors who, 
because of their experience and training, should have been the most capable of the 
pilots to be able to recognise the potential for a mid-air collision and take avoiding 
action. It appears that in these cases the instructors might have been focusing more 
on instructing or examining the student pilots and less on ensuring the safety of their 
aircraft.  
The Commission recommends that the Director inform flight instructors at all levels 
of the findings of this report, and in particular that their first responsibility is the 
safety of the aircraft they are commanding, before attending to the needs of their 
student pilots. Further, instructors are reminded of their responsibility for ensuring 
that student pilots are informed and competent to listen for, see and avoid other 
aircraft before allowing them to fly solo. (Recommendation 029/12)  
8.3.2.  The Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions have shown that despite pilots 
making appropriate radio transmissions, they have failed to listen actively and 
respond appropriately to the transmissions of others and take action to avoid 
collisions.  
 
51 Certified aerodromes had runways capable of handling aircraft with more than 30 passengers or 3,400 
kilograms of cargo, and were available for regular public transport or charter operations by such aircraft. 
 
  Final Report AO-2019-006 
<< Page 59 >>
 The Commission also notes that limitations with the concept of see and avoid 
probably contributed to the Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions as well as 
the near miss above New Plymouth.  
The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation use the lessons from 
this report to educate pilots at all levels of the aviation industry, and in particular 
flight training establishments, of:  
 how important the concept of see and avoid is for detecting and avoiding other 
aircraft  
 the limitations of the concept of see and avoid  
 the importance of making clear and concise radio transmissions to warn other 
aircraft of your location and intentions, and the importance of listening to radio 
transmissions from other aircraft to help build an accurate mental picture of the 
situation around you. (Recommendation 030/12)  
8.3.3  Various aircraft paint schemes have shown to have little benefit in improving the 
conspicuity of aircraft for the wide range of weather, environmental and geographical 
conditions likely to be encountered. Similarly, the current minimum aircraft lighting 
requirements are not always effective in attracting the attention of pilots in bright 
conditions. However, more modern, high-intensity strobe lighting and new high-
visibility paints may increase the ability of an aircraft to be detected in most lighting 
conditions and could improve the reliability of see and avoid as a primary means of 
preventing mid-air collisions. 
The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation initiate a review of 
aircraft anti-collision lighting systems, including the use of high-visibility paints, to 
determine whether there are systems that can increase the visibility of aircraft; and if 
such systems are found to exist with demonstrable safety benefits, start action to 
promote, encourage or mandate their application in the New Zealand civil aviation 
system. (Recommendation 031/12)  
On 12 March 2013, the Director of Civil Aviation Authority replied:  
a)  Recommendations 029/12 and 030/12. As provided in our letter of 23 August 
2012, the CAA considers the level of its current activity to address the issues is 
sufficient, given the competing priorities. Accordingly, the CAA considers that 
both recommendations have been fully addressed.  
b)  Recommendation 031/12. The CAA confirms the recommendation is being 
implemented. A review of anti-collision lighting systems and high-visibility 
paint use is currently being assessed by the Operations and Airworthiness 
Group. An implementation date has yet to be finalised.

  Kōwhaiwhai - Māori scroll designs 
TAIC commissioned its four kōwhaiwhai, Māori scroll designs, from artist Sandy Rodgers (Ngāti 
Raukawa, Tūwharetoa, MacDougal). Sandy began from thinking of the Commission as a vehicle or vessel 
for seeking knowledge to understand transport accident tragedies and how to avoid them. A 'waka whai 
mārama' (i te ara haumaru) is 'a vessel/vehicle in pursuit of understanding'. Waka is a metaphor for the 
Commission. Mārama (from 'te ao mārama' - the world of light) is for the separation of Rangitāne (Sky 
Father) and Papatūānuku (Earth Mother) by their son Tāne Māhuta (god of man, forests and everything 
dwelling within), which brought light and thus awareness to the world. 'Te ara' is 'the path' and 
'haumaru' is 'safe' or 'risk free'.  
Corporate: Te Ara Haumaru - the safe and risk free path 
 
The eye motif looks to the future, watching the path for obstructions. The encased double koru is the 
mother and child, symbolising protection, safety and guidance. The triple koru represents the three kete 
of knowledge that Tāne Māhuta collected from the highest of the heavens to pass their wisdom to 
humanity. The continual wave is the perpetual line of influence. The succession of humps represents the 
individual inquiries.  
Sandy acknowledges Tāne Māhuta in the creation of this Kōwhaiwhai. 
Aviation: Ngā hau e whā - the four winds 
To Sandy, 'Ngā hau e whā ' (the four winds), commonly used in Te Reo Māori to refer to people coming 
together from across Aotearoa, was also redolent of the aviation environment. The design represents 
the sky, cloud, and wind. There is a manu (bird) form representing the aircraft that move through 
Aotearoa's 'long white cloud'. The letter 'A' is present, standing for a 'Aviation'.  
Sandy acknowledges Ranginui (Sky father) and Tāwhirimātea (God of wind) in the creation of this 
Kōwhaiwhai. 
Maritime: Ara wai - waterways 
 
The sections of waves flowing across the design represent the many different 'ara wai' (waterways)
