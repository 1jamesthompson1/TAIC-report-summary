","0.0","20.0","The pilot of ZK-CBY ""did not see ZK-WAK in time to avoid the collision"" (4.6), and the pilots ""either did not consider the other aeroplane to be a threat or they were not actively listening to the content of the calls"" (3.24). This indicates that human error and assumptions played a significant role in the accident.
","0.0","10.0","The pilot of ZK-CBY ""did not meet the flight time requirement for the issue of a commercial parachute drop rating"" (4.2), but this was not considered a contributing cause of the mid-air collision. However, the pilot was flying a non-standard and non-compliant join, as they had been instructed during training (4.3), indicating that training and competency were contributing factors.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention in the document of issues related to training and familiarity with equipment contributing to the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that crew resource management was a factor in the mid-air collision.
","0.0","30.0","The pilot of ZK-CBY was ""flying a non-standard and non-compliant join"" (4.3), and this non-standard procedure had become an ""accepted routine practice at Masterton"" (3.36). The lack of adherence to safety procedures was a significant contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","15.0","The ""passive acceptance of the non-compliant behaviour"" and ""the resistance to adopting an aerodrome SMS indicate that the safety culture at Masterton was deficient"" (3.39). This suggests that organizational safety culture was a contributing factor to the accident.
","0.0","5.0","While the document does not explicitly state that risk management and analysis were factors, the existence of a non-compliant procedure that was not addressed (3.36) suggests a lack of effective risk management.
","0.0","10.0","The document indicates that there was a lack of regulatory oversight and compliance, as evidenced by the non-standard joining procedure that had become accepted practice (3.36) and the lack of communication between CAA and other bodies regarding responsibilities for safe operation of unattended aerodromes (4.13).
","0.0","10.0","The pilots' lack of situational awareness contributed to the accident, as they did not see each other in time to avoid the collision (3.3, 3.27).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the mid-air collision.
","0.0","0.0","Both aeroplanes were in an airworthy condition and no mechanical issues were identified (3.10), indicating that maintenance and inspection regimes were not contributing factors.
","0.0","0.0","There is no mention in the document of automation being a factor in the accident.
","0.0","0.0","The weather was ""fine and calm with nearly unlimited visibility"" and was not a factor in the accident (3.10).
","0.0","0.0","Although the pilots made appropriate radio calls (3.10), there was a failure to effectively communicate and respond to each other's position and intentions (3.24, 3.27). However, this is more closely related to human error and assumptions, and situational awareness, rather than a breakdown in the communication system itself.
