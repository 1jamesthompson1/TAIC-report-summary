- Non-compliance, unless addressed as soon as practicable, can quickly become accepted and normalised, increasing the risk of an accident. The lack of a definition of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had created confusion for pilots.
- The defence of 'see and avoid' is not foolproof against mid-air collisions and, despite repeated efforts to educate pilots about safety around aerodromes, these types of accidents continue to occur.
- Aerodrome managers, in particular those at unattended aerodromes, lacked the guidance and understanding of their roles and accountabilities regarding the CARs and the Health and Safety at Work regulations, which was necessary to be able to discharge their responsibilities and ensure the safe operation of their aerodrome.
