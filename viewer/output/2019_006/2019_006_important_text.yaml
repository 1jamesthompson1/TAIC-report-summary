  Introduction \n3.1. A pilot is ultimately responsible for ensuring the safety of\
  \ their aircraft.23 24 To help \nachieve this a pilot needs to build and maintain\
  \ a mental picture or model of the \nsurrounding world to help identify potential\
  \ threats and choose the most effective and \nsafest course of action, which has\
  \ often been termed 'maintaining situational \nawareness'. The need to maintain\
  \ this is especially important in uncontrolled airspace \nwhere a pilot does not\
  \ have the direct support of an air traffic controller. A pilot is \ntherefore solely\
  \ responsible for ensuring that a safe separation from other aircraft is \nmaintained.\
  \ \n3.2. This accident occurred in a 'class G' uncontrolled airspace. Therefore\
  \ the 'see and \navoid' principle was both the primary and final defence in preventing\
  \ a mid-air \ncollision. To assist with this, pilots would follow the rules and\
  \ approved procedures. \nThey would also make radio broadcasts on the local area\
  \ frequency, stating their \nposition and intentions. However, not all aircraft\
  \ are fitted with radios, nor were they \nrequired to be.  \n3.3. In this accident,\
  \ the pilot of ZK-WAK very likely never saw ZK-CBY approaching from \nthe right\
  \ and behind, while the pilot of ZK-CBY did not see ZK-WAK in sufficient time \n\
  to take action and avoid a collision. \n3.4. The following section analyses the\
  \ circumstances surrounding the accident to identify \nthose factors which increased\
  \ the likelihood of the mid-air collision occurring. The \nanalysis also examines\
  \ the occurrence regarding previous mid-air collisions that \ndisplayed significant\
  \ similarities, and any safety issues which have the potential to \nadversely affect\
  \ future operations.  \n3.5. Four safety issues were identified as a result and\
  \ these are described below. \nWhat happened \n3.6. On Sunday 16 June 2019, the\
  \ pilot of ZK-WAK had just completed a short local scenic \nflight and returned\
  \ to Masterton Aerodrome to operate in the right-hand 06 runway \ncircuit. At 1112,\
  \ the aeroplane was on a final approach to land. \n3.7. At the same time, the pilot\
  \ of ZK-CBY was re-joining to land on the left-hand 06L \nrunway, having previously\
  \ released some parachutists overhead of the aerodrome. The \nre-join was in a non-standard\
  \ right-hand direction, as this was how the pilot of ZK-\nCBY had been instructed\
  \ to join during their training (see figure 11).  \n3.8. As ZK-CBY flew around the\
  \ base leg, ZK-WAK would have been in front of and below \nZK-CBY. The pilot's view\
  \ of ZK-WAK would therefore have very likely  been obscured \nby ZK-CBY's engine\
  \ cowling. As both aeroplanes approached their respective runways, \nZK-CBY flying\
  \ at an approach speed estimated to be at least 50 knots (90 kilometres \nper hour)\
  \ faster than that of a Tecnam, rapidly closed-in on ZK-WAK. With ZK-CBY \nbanked\
  \ to the right as it turned to line up with runway 06L, its right wheel and right\

  \ of ZK-WAK (see \nfigure 12). The two aeroplanes collided heavily and initially\
  \ tangled before separating \nand spiralling to the ground. \n3.9. The two pilots\
  \ were killed in the collision. \n3.10. The investigation found that both pilots\
  \ were fit and healthy, and fatigue was not a \nfactor. The weather, fine and calm\
  \ with nearly unlimited visibility, was also not a \nfactor.25 Both aeroplanes were\
  \ in an airworthy condition and no mechanical issues \nwere identified. The pilots\
  \ of both aeroplanes had made appropriate radio calls at \nvarious locations along\
  \ their flightpaths and should have been able to hear the radio \ntransmissions\
  \ from other aircraft. The failure of a radio receiver in either aeroplane in \n\
  the few minutes leading up to the collision could not be fully excluded. However,\
  \ this \nwas considered exceptionally unlikely  in the circumstances. The investigation\
  \ \ntherefore focused on pilot performance and training, operating procedures and\
  \ \noversight.   \n \nFigure 11: Flightpaths of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK \nNote: The location\
  \ of ZK-CBY when the calls were made (the blue dots) is based on the \nFLARM data\
  \ matched to the recorded timing of the calls so is considered to be \naccurate.\

  Civil Aviation rules and procedures \nRules and procedures \n3.11. The pilot of\
  \ an aircraft joining an aerodrome or circuit is required to conform to the \nestablished\
  \ traffic circuit and give way to aircraft that are already operating in that \n\
  circuit.26 On the day of the accident, aircraft at Masterton were using 06 as the\
  \ \ndesignated runway. There were three runways aligned on 06 that could be used.\
  \ Two \nrunways, 06 and 06R, were designated as right-hand circuits and the third\
  \ runway, 06L, \nwas a left-hand circuit. Parachuting was also taking place.   \n\
  3.12. The pilot of ZK-WAK had re-joined the circuit via the right-hand downwind\
  \ leg for \nrunway 06, the sealed centre runway. This was logical as the pilot had\
  \ taken off only \n10 minutes before and was returning from northeast of the aerodrome.\
  \ The pilot was \ntherefore familiar with the local conditions and joining almost\
  \ directly into the \ndownwind leg was the most efficient means of doing so. It\
  \ also avoided flying a \nstandard overhead joining procedure that may have conflicted\
  \ with the parachuting \ntaking place. \n3.13. The pilot of ZK-CBY returned via\
  \ a wide descending right turn to join on a right-base \nleg for runway 06L. This\
  \ was not in accordance with CARs as runway 06L was a left-\nhand circuit.27 To\
  \ join for 06L and ensure compliance with CARs, the pilot needed to \nremain clear\
  \ of the 06 and 06R circuits and join via either a wide left base or a long \nfinal\
  \ straight-in approach, thereby also remaining clear of any parachutists. The \n\
  possible reasoning for joining via a right base is discussed in paragraph 3.34.\

  \ Final Report AO-2019-006 \n<< Page 23 >>\n 3.14. The pilot of ZK-CBY, as the joining,\
  \ faster and overtaking aeroplane, needed to give \nway to ZK-WAK as the slower\
  \ aeroplane on final approach.28 However, this was \ndependent on the pilot of ZK-CBY\
  \ being aware of ZK-WAK and observing it in \nsufficient time to take avoiding action.\
  \ This is discussed further in the following \nparagraphs. \nSee and avoid \nSeeing\
  \ other aircraft \n3.15.  The CAA Rules direct pilots to observe other aircraft\
  \ to avoid a collision. Witness \nobservations, weather reports and photographs\
  \ confirm that the weather conditions at \nthe time of the collision were good and\
  \ there should have been no environmental \nimpediment to pilots seeing other aircraft\
  \ in the circuit area.  \n3.16. At 1112, the sun was determined to be 23\xB0 above\
  \ the horizon and on a bearing of \n015\xB0 True. As ZK-CBY flew around the base\
  \ leg, the sun would have been to the front \nof and above the pilot. The pilot\
  \ was not wearing sunglasses or a ballcap, but the \naeroplane was equipped with\
  \ a sun visor that if needed the pilot could have used to \nreduce any downward\
  \ glare. Further, as the two aeroplanes closed, ZK-WAK was \nbelow ZK-CBY and so\
  \ the sun should not have restricted the pilot of ZK-CBY's view in \nthis direction.\
  \ The accuracy with which ZK-CBY was being flown around the base leg \nand positioned\
  \ to land on 06L suggests the pilot of ZK-CBY had no difficulty looking \nin this\
  \ direction. \n3.17. ZK-WAK was mainly painted in white, which should have provided\
  \ a reasonable \ncontrast against the generally green background. The pilot of ZK-WAK\
  \ was reportedly \ntrained to have the strobe light on during aeroplane operations.\
  \ The light was \ncontrolled by a rocker switch. The damage sustained meant it was\
  \ not possible to \nconfirm the position of the switch prior to the collision, but\
  \ it was considered very \nlikely to have been on. However, a small aircraft on\
  \ a bright day can still be \nchallenging to locate. Knowing where to look, perhaps\
  \ directed by a radio call, enables \na pilot to focus their attention in a certain\
  \ area and increase the likelihood of \ndetection. \n3.18. The pilot of ZK-WAK had\
  \ priority to land and was likely unconcerned about ZK-CBY as \nit was behind ZK-WAK\
  \ and joining for a different runway. Therefore, as the two \naeroplanes closed,\
  \ the pilot of ZK-WAK would very likely  have been looking forward \nand focusing\
  \ on preparing to land, not back and to the right. There would have been \nno expectation\
  \ that an aeroplane would approach from the rear quarter. Also, the \ncabin structure\
  \ of a Tecnam, like most aircraft, would have made it difficult for the \npilot\
  \ of ZK-WAK to see out the rear. \nField of view \n3.19. The engine cowling and\
  \ propeller of a Cessna 185 type of aeroplane extends some 1.6 \nmetres in front\
  \ of the pilot's instrument panel. This limits a pilot's field of view when \nlooking\
  \ forward. Figure 13 shows the 'field of view' chart for the Cessna 185 \naeroplane.\
  \ The chart is based on the '85th percentile human male'.29   \n \n28 CAR 91.229\
  \ (d), (e) and (f).  \n29 The chart applies to 85% of all males and the pilot would\
  \ have fitted into this grouping.  \n \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006\
  \   3.20. Working back from the known collision point and impact angle, the recorded\
  \ \napproach path and speed of ZK-CBY and the likely approach speed of ZK-WAK,30\
  \ it \nwas possible to determine the approximate relative bearings of the two aeroplanes\
  \ \nleading up to the collision. From this, it was determined to be very likely\
  \  that the pilot \nof ZK-CBY's view of ZK-WAK would have been obscured by the aeroplane's\
  \ engine \ncowling in the approximately 15-20 seconds leading up to the collision.\
  \  \n3.21. During training, pilots are taught about blind spots and the need to\
  \ check these areas \nto ensure they are free of potential hazards. This may be\
  \ by moving the head and \nupper body, or by manoeuvring the aircraft. To assist\
  \ in locating and identifying other \naircraft, pilots can also use their radios\
  \ if fitted.  \n \nFigure 13: Cessna 185 visibility diagram \n(Credit: Cessna Aircraft\
  \ Company) \nThe need to listen and look \n3.22. In the approximately 25-minute\
  \ period that ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK were airborne, both \npilots made the prerequisite\
  \ radio calls as they flew about the local area and back into \nthe circuit. The\
  \ recorded radio calls were clear and able to be easily heard and \nunderstood.\
  \ In the five minutes leading up to the collision there were nine radio calls \n\
  made. Two were from two aircraft transiting through the area. Two were from ZK-\n\
  WRA, the second Tecnam, reporting 'finals' and taxiing in. Two were from a helicopter\
  \ \noperating in the vicinity. The final three calls were made by the pilots of\
  \ ZK-CBY and \nZK-WAK. The calls from ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not interfere with any\
  \ of the other \ncalls and suggest that the two pilots were able to hear radio transmissions\
  \ from other \naircraft. See Appendix 1. \n3.23. Why the pilot of ZK-WAK called\
  \ \"going round 06 remaining in the circuit\" could not be \ndetermined. It may\
  \ have been because it was always their intention, they were not \nhappy with the\
  \ approach, or simply a realisation that the preceding downwind call did \nnot advise\
  \ whether it was to be a landing or a touch and go. The subsequent calls \nwere\
  \ appropriate and gave no indication of any concern by the pilot.  \n \n30 Based\
  \ on limited primary radar recordings and flight manual guidance material. \n\n\
  \ \n  Final Report AO-2019-006 \n<< Page 25 >>\n 3.24. These radio calls should\
  \ have alerted the two pilots to each other's location and \nintention. If there\
  \ are any concerns about another aircraft, a pilot is encouraged to \nchallenge\
  \ or question the pilot of that aircraft.31 For example, by asking them to repeat\
  \ \ntheir position report or confirming they have them in sight. That the calls\
  \ made by the \npilots of ZK-CBY and ZK-WAK did not elicit any response from each\
  \ other indicates \nthat the pilots either did not consider the other aeroplane\
  \ to be a threat or they were \nnot actively listening to the content of the calls.\
  \   \n3.25. For the pilot of ZK-WAK, the radio call from ZK-CBY reporting at the\
  \ Ponds reporting \npoint likely indicated to the pilot that this aeroplane was\
  \ well behind and (as the \njoining aircraft) would keep clear of ZK-WAK. The pilot\
  \ of ZK-WAK may therefore not \nhave considered ZK-CBY to be a threat. \n3.26. For\
  \ the pilot of ZK-CBY, the downwind radio call from ZK-WAK was made as ZK-CBY \n\
  was still well to the north at about 5000 feet. The pilot of ZK-CBY therefore needed\
  \ to \nlocate ZK-WAK to ensure a safe separation was maintained as both aeroplanes\
  \ \napproached to land on 06 and 06L.  \n3.27. The downwind call by the pilot of\
  \ ZK-WAK call was immediately preceded by a \nseparate call from the club's second\
  \ Tecnam, ZK-WRA, advising that it had landed and \nwas taxiing back to the club.\
  \ The sequence and timing of these two calls meant that \nthe pilot of ZK-CBY should\
  \ not have mistaken ZK-WRA for ZK-WAK. The downwind \ncall from ZK-WAK should have\
  \ again alerted the pilot of ZK-CBY to be aware there was \nan aircraft ahead. \n\
  3.28. ZK-WRA and ZK-WAK, pronounced over the radio as Whisky Romeo Alpha and \n\
  Whisky Alpha Kilo, were similar callsigns. However, while confusion on behalf of\
  \ the \npilot of ZK-CBY about the position and intended flightpaths of the two Tecnams\
  \ \ncannot be fully discounted, it was considered very unlikely  for a number of\
  \ reasons, \nincluding: \n\uF0B7 The aero club and parachuting operator were located\
  \ close to each other on the \naerodrome and the pilot of ZK-CBY would very likely\
  \  have known there were two \nsimilarly coloured Tecnams and their callsigns. \
  \ \n\uF0B7 The voices of the two Tecnam pilots sounded different over the radios.\
  \ \n\uF0B7 The radio traffic on the aerodrome frequency (nine radio calls spread\
  \ over the five \nminutes leading up to the collision) meant that the frequency\
  \ was not busy. The \nnine calls included three from ZK-WAK and two from ZK-WRA.\
  \ \n \n3.29. The proximity of the two aeroplanes when the 'finals' call from ZK-WAK\
  \ was made \ngave the pilot of ZK-CBY no time to locate ZK-WAK ( very likely  hidden\
  \ from view) \nand avoid the collision. \nTechnologies for collision avoidance \n\
  3.30. Advances in technology have resulted in the development of electronic systems\
  \ that \nhelp alert pilots to the presence and threat posed by other aircraft. These\
  \ include both \nairborne collision alerting and avoidance systems and ground-based\
  \ alerting systems \n \n31 This is communicated in a variety of ways, including\
  \ CARs, pilot licence flight test guides and CAA Vector \nmagazine articles. Advisory\
  \ Circular AC91-9, Radiotelephony Manual states: \"If there is doubt that a message\
  \ \nhas been correctly received, a repetition of the message should be requested\
  \ in full or in part\".  \n \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006   such\
  \ as 'short-term conflict alert'. ZK-CBY was equipped with a FLARM airborne \nalerting\
  \ system. However, these alerting systems usually require both aircraft to be \n\
  similarly fitted. ZK-WAK was not similarly equipped, nor was it required to be.\
  \ In \nuncontrolled airspace, aircraft are not required to be fitted with a traffic\
  \ alerting device \nand they may not even have a radio. Therefore, while these technologies\
  \ would assist \nin preventing mid-air collisions, the need to 'see and avoid' remains\
  \ critical. The \nCommission welcomes advances and efforts to implement these technologies\
  \ as \nwidely as possible. \n \nAerodrome practices \nSafety issue: Non-compliance,\
  \ unless addressed as soon as practicable, can quickly become \naccepted and normalised,\
  \ increasing the risk of an accident. \n \nSafety issue: The lack of a definition\
  \ of what was meant by 'simultaneous operations' had \ncreated confusion for pilots.\
  \ \n \nNon-compliance in the circuit as an accepted practice \n3.31. On the accident\
  \ flight the pilot of ZK-CBY was re-joining via a right base leg for \nrunway 06L\
  \ when the collision occurred. The pilot had followed the same procedure \non the\
  \ earlier flight that morning. This procedure was not in accordance with CAR \n\
  91.223, which stipulated that pilots were to either conform with or avoid the circuit\
  \ \nestablished by other aircraft and perform a left-hand circuit for 06L. The pilot\
  \ \ntherefore needed to remain clear of the 06 and 06R circuit patterns.  \n3.32.\
  \ To land on 06L, the pilot could have re-joined either via a wide left base or\
  \ straight in. \nWith parachuting taking place it would not have been safe to re-join\
  \ via either a \nstandard overhead joining procedure or the downwind leg. The notes\
  \ on the \naerodrome landing chart reflected this. \n3.33. A review of the FLARM\
  \ tracking data for ZK-CBY showed that the pilot of ZK-CBY \nwould return via the\
  \ Ponds reporting point, regardless of the runway in use. The data \nshowed that\
  \ when the 06 runways were in use, it had become routine practice for the \npilot\
  \ to take-off on 0632 and land on 06L on some six occasions since 8 June.33 All\
  \ \nother flights had landed on runway 24.   \n3.34. The pilot had been taught during\
  \ training to re-join via the Ponds reporting point and, \nwhen 06 was in use, to\
  \ join right base and land on 06L. This informal practice dated as \nfar back as\
  \ 2015 or 2016. It was reported to Commission investigators that an \nexperienced\
  \ and long-time local pilot had recommended to the then parachute drop \npilots\
  \ to re-join via right base for 06L. This procedure offered several advantages,\
  \ \nincluding: \n\uF0B7 'the Ponds' was a well-known and obvious location and reporting\
  \ point that \nsuited the descent profile of the parachuting aeroplane for both\
  \ runways  \n\uF0B7 it avoided flying near the township, thereby minimising noise\
  \ nuisance  \n \n32 The aeroplane would be heavier and so the longer runway was\
  \ required. \n33 Two earlier flights on 18 May, the pilot's first day of commercial\
  \ dropping, landed on 06R. \n \n  Final Report AO-2019-006 \n<< Page 27 >>\n \uF0B7\
  \ it was easier to land a tail-wheeled aeroplane on grass34 \n\uF0B7 landing on\
  \ grass resulted in less wear on the tyres  \n\uF0B7 it was closer to the operator's\
  \ base and avoided having to cross other active \nrunways after landing \n\uF0B7\
  \ it avoided two aircraft being 'belly up'35 to each other as they turned onto \n\
  finals, making it more difficult to see the opposing aircraft. \n3.35. This non-standard\
  \ procedure was then adopted by the operator's pilots and passed \nonto any new\
  \ pilots who joined. The operator-owner was aware ZK-CBY was being \nlanded on 06L,\
  \ but was not a pilot and therefore not aware the procedure was in \nconflict with\
  \ CARs. The operator-owner instead relied on the company's pilots to \nmanage the\
  \ flying side of the business. \n3.36. Interviews of current and former local pilots\
  \ at Masterton confirmed that the non-\nstandard procedure flown by ZK-CBY, and\
  \ sometimes other aircraft, had become an \naccepted routine practice at Masterton.\
  \ The interviews included many experienced \nlocal pilots of long-standing, aerodrome\
  \ personnel, and current and former CAA staff \nwho flew at Masterton. \n3.37. A\
  \ review of the aerodrome's user group records going back five years and the safety\
  \ \ncommittee meeting minutes found no reference to the non-standard joining \n\
  procedure. The CAA's incident data base also identified no incidents, complaints\
  \ or \nreference to the non-standard procedure.  \n3.38. Safety culture is an expression\
  \ of how safety is perceived, valued and prioritised at all \nlevels within an organisation\
  \ (including an aerodrome environment) and reflects the \nextent to which individuals,\
  \ and groups are committed to safety.36 Fostering an \nenvironment where there is\
  \ a willingness to report and manage risks to safety is an \nessential component\
  \ of a healthy safety culture.  \n3.39. The passive acceptance of the non-compliant\
  \ behaviour, the absence of proactive \nsafety reporting and the resistance to adopting\
  \ an aerodrome SMS indicate that the \nsafety culture at Masterton was deficient.\
  \ \nIdentification of non-compliant behaviours \n3.40. Further to the questioning\
  \ about circuit behaviours, a sample of flight examiners, chief \nflying instructors\
  \ and senior pilots from around the country were contacted to \ndetermine if routine\
  \ non-compliance at aerodromes was a wider issue than just \nMasterton. Most of\
  \ those contacted confirmed that non-compliance was not unusual \nand was almost\
  \ solely confined to unattended aerodromes - those without an air \ntraffic service\
  \ in attendance. \n3.41. This general non-compliance at unattended aerodromes is\
  \ understandable. When an \nincident occurs at an attended aerodrome there would\
  \ usually be at least three parties \npresent, one being a controller or possibly\
  \ an aerodrome flight information service \nperson.37 It was therefore less likely\
  \ that the incident would be ignored or hidden. \n \n34 A grass surface was better\
  \ for directional control, especially for low-time pilots still learning to handle\
  \ the \nunique characteristics of a tail-wheeled aeroplane. \n35 Having the underside\
  \ of an aircraft facing the opposing traffic, thus limiting a pilot's view in this\
  \ direction. \n36 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Safety Management\
  \ Manual (Doc 9859), 2018.   \n37 A person located in a tower providing aerodrome\
  \ information only, for example weather and runway \nconditions, but not a controlling\
  \ service.  \n \n\n<< Page 28 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006   Whereas, at a small\
  \ unattended aerodrome the pilot(s) involved may not wish to \nofficially report\
  \ an incident for whatever reason. Also, at an unattended aerodrome, if \nthe incident\
  \ was a near collision one or both of the pilots may never have seen the \nopposing\
  \ aircraft and might not be aware of how close they had come. \nIncident reporting\
  \ \n3.42. Following the Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions, the CAA commissioned\
  \ a \nreview of joining procedures at uncontrolled aerodromes.38 The review found,\
  \ among \nother things, that: \n\u2026there is significant under-reporting of incidents\
  \ at uncontrolled aerodromes. \nAnecdotally, the level of under-reporting appears\
  \ to be in the order of only 1-in-5 to \n1-in-10 incidents are reported, with the\
  \ extent of under-reporting varying across \naerodromes.  \nThis was evidenced at\
  \ Paraparaumu Aerodrome where a flight information service was \nestablished following\
  \ the mid-air collision there in February 2008. The incident \nreporting rates increased\
  \ significantly, despite the traffic levels remaining about the \nsame         \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \        \n3.43. Should a non-compliant action or procedure go unchallenged or be\
  \ accepted it risks \nbecoming normalised. This may suit local operators who are\
  \ aware of the non-\ncompliance and modify their actions to accommodate it. However,\
  \ it may also increase \nthe risk of an accident, especially for those unfamiliar\
  \ with the ad hoc procedure. Were \na new non-standard action or procedure to be\
  \ identified that might offer some \nbenefit, then it needs to be considered by\
  \ the appropriate parties and a risk benefit \nreview undertaken. If accepted, it\
  \ might then be added to the notes for all users to be \ninformed. An example of\
  \ this was the note on the Masterton landing chart that \noverhead joins were to\
  \ be avoided when parachuting was taking place.   \nSimultaneous operations  \n\
  3.44. The two aeroplanes were on final approach to land when they collided 1 kilometre\
  \ \nfrom the threshold or start of the runways. The aerodrome chart included a note\
  \ \nstating that \"Simultaneous operations on parallel paved and grass runways \n\
  prohibited\".  \n3.45. Interviews of local pilots provided different interpretations\
  \ of what simultaneous \noperations meant. Responses ranged from not allowed to\
  \ be side-by-side with \nanother aircraft to not allowed to cross the threshold\
  \ of a runway until the other \naircraft had cleared the far end of a runway. \n\
  3.46. CAA documents did provide some guidance. However, most of this related to\
  \ parallel \nrunways at controlled aerodromes and involved aircraft landing under\
  \ instrument \nflight rules. There was no guidance material that related to parallel\

  \ \n<< Page 29 >>\n Information Publication (AIP) - Planning Manual did provide\
  \ a definition which stated: \nSimultaneous operations \nTwo or more aircraft operating\
  \ from parallel runways, taking off and/or landing at the \nsame time. In this context\
  \ take-off is from the start of the take-off roll to becoming \nairborne, and landing\
  \ is from touchdown to completion of the landing roll. \n However, with the digitisation\
  \ of the AIP in about 1999, this definition was removed. \n3.47. Had there been\
  \ a clear definition that was understood by pilots, and if the pilots of \nZK-CBY\
  \ and ZK-WAK had been aware of each other, the pilot of ZK-CBY may have \nbeen more\
  \ alert to ensuring the required spacing with ZK-WAK was maintained. \nLanding charts\
  \ \n3.48. The investigation found that when reviewing the aerodrome charts for a\
  \ range of \naerodromes, many of the charts used different terms and did not accurately\
  \ reflect the \ncurrent status of the information referred to. For example, parachuting\
  \ operations may \nhave ceased or moved location on the aerodrome.  \n3.49. The\
  \ CAA advised that a comprehensive review of all aerodrome charts was to be \nundertaken\
  \ to ensure they were both consistent and current as far as practicable. \nMid-air\
  \ collisions \nSafety issue: The defence of 'see and avoid' is not foolproof against\
  \ mid-air collisions and, \ndespite repeated efforts to educate pilots about safety\
  \ around aerodromes, these types of \naccidents continue to occur. \n \n3.50. The\
  \ mid-air collision at Masterton on 16 June 2019 was the third such collision at\
  \ an \nunattended aerodrome that the Commission has investigated since 2008.  \n\
  Common factors \n3.51. The three mid-air collisions share some common factors, including:\
  \ \n\uF0B7 the collisions occurred at unattended aerodromes \n\uF0B7 each collision\
  \ involved an aircraft that was re-joining \n\uF0B7 the weather conditions on each\
  \ occasion were good, with little or no cloud and \nnear unlimited visibility \n\
  \uF0B7 on each occasion the pilots had made the appropriate radio calls, which should\
  \ \nhave been heard by the pilot(s) of the opposing aircraft \n\uF0B7 all the pilots\
  \ were familiar with the aerodrome and procedures \n\uF0B7 one of the pilots involved\
  \ in each of the collisions held a commercial pilot \nlicence or higher qualification.\
  \  \n3.52. The Commission's Paraparaumu report made reference to several international\
  \ \nstudies. These studies identified similar common factors, such as that most\
  \ of the \ncollisions occurred at small aerodromes in good weather conditions and\
  \ involved \npilots with a wide range of experiences. See Citations on \n<< page\
  \ 48 >>\n for the list of \nreferences. \n \n\n<< Page 30 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006\
  \   3.53. Following the 2008 Paraparaumu mid-air collision, the Commission conducted\
  \ a \nreview of mid-air collisions in New Zealand. It found that none of the 12\
  \ collisions that \nhad occurred over the preceding 20 years had done so in controlled\
  \ airspace. Five of \nthe collisions had occurred on or near an aerodrome and the\
  \ 2010 mid-air collision at \nFeilding was no different.  \nJoining an aerodrome\
  \ \n3.54. The international studies into mid-air collisions found that they mostly\
  \ occurred in or \nnear the circuit. This was consistent with New Zealand's relatively\
  \ small sampling and \nwas not surprising. Aerodromes are where there is a greater\
  \ concentration of aircraft, \nincreasing the risk of a mid-air collision. This\
  \ is even more so at non-certificated and \nunattended aerodromes where there is\
  \ no controller present to oversee and ensure \nthe safe, orderly flow of traffic.\
  \ \n3.55. The joining procedure is an area of potentially higher workload for a\
  \ pilot. A pilot \nneeds to assess the aerodrome and runway conditions, complete\
  \ aircraft checks, make \nradio calls, locate other traffic and manoeuvre the aircraft\
  \ to fit in with the traffic. At \nunattended aerodromes, this may include non-radio\
  \ equipped aircraft. A note in the \nMasterton landing chart made reference to non-radio\
  \ equipped aircraft using the \nlarge grassed area adjacent to runway 06L.  \n \n\
  Weather \n3.56. The prevailing weather conditions for the three mid-air collisions\
  \ were good and so \nthere was no obvious impediment to sighting the opposing aircraft\
  \ as they flew about \nthe aerodromes. However, bright, fine conditions can mean\
  \ that aircraft navigation \nlights and anti-collision beacons may be less conspicuous\
  \ when compared to duller \nconditions. Pilots therefore need to be equally alert\
  \ to sighting other traffic in both \ngood and bad weather conditions. For the three\
  \ New Zealand mid-air collisions there \nwas insufficient evidence to determine\
  \ the level of influence the good weather \nconditions may have played. \nRadio\
  \ calls \n3.57. The pilots in the three mid-air collisions all made the required\
  \ radio call leading up to \nthe collisions. The transmitting of a radio call stating\
  \ aircraft identification, position \nand intentions helps other pilots maintain\
  \ a good mental picture or situational \nawareness of where other aircraft are and\
  \ what they are doing. It therefore assists with \n'see and avoid'.  \n3.58. Pilots\
  \ may, however, think that having made their pre-requisite radio call they have\
  \ \ninformed other traffic and can therefore relax. When a radio call is made, pilots\
  \ need \nto immediately give it their full attention to determine its relevance\
  \ and respond \nappropriately. Should a pilot continue to be unsure about another\
  \ aircraft, either \nabout its position or intentions, they can use the radio to\
  \ address these issues and \nmanage any potential risk. \nFamiliarity  \n3.59. All\
  \ seven of the pilots involved in the three collisions were familiar with the applicable\
  \ \naerodrome and its procedures. For six of the pilots it was their home base and\
  \ the \n \n  Final Report AO-2019-006 \n<< Page 31 >>\n aerodrome they did most,\
  \ if not all, of their flying from. They therefore had a level of \nfamiliarity\
  \ with the local environment and were likely comfortable in it. However, like \n\
  the effect of weather, there was insufficient evidence to qualify the effect this\
  \ might \nhave had in each of the three collisions. \nPilot experience \n3.60. Each\
  \ of the three collisions involved both students or pilots with low experience and\
  \ \npilots holding a commercial pilot licence. Two of the commercial pilots held\
  \ instructor \nqualifications. This was in line with the international studies that\
  \ showed that mid-air \ncollisions were not experience dependent. Even high-time\
  \ and highly qualified pilots \nare having mid-air collisions.   \n \nSafety at\
  \ unattended aerodromes \nSafety issue: Aerodrome managers, in particular those\
  \ at unattended aerodromes, lacked the \nguidance and understanding of their roles\
  \ and accountabilities regarding the CARs and the \nHealth and Safety at Work regulations,\
  \ which was necessary to be able to discharge their \nresponsibilities and ensure\
  \ the safe operation of their aerodrome.  \n3.61. The Commission's investigation\
  \ into this and previous mid-air collisions identified a \nlack of guidance and\
  \ support to aerodrome managers on how to safely operate \nunattended aerodromes.\
  \ This was initially highlighted in the Commission's report into \nthe Paraparaumu\
  \ accident, which had recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation \nthat CAA staff\
  \ \"monitor aerodromes, particularly non-certificated aerodromes, to \nensure safety\
  \ efforts are best directed to promote the coordinated safe management \nof flying\
  \ activities\".  \n3.62. In response to the recommendation, the Director of Civil\
  \ Aviation replied that: \nAs advised in previous correspondence, as Director of\
  \ Civil Aviation I have limited regulatory \npowers with respect to non-certificated\
  \ aerodromes. \nWithin the resources available to it, the CAA directs its attention\
  \ to those aerodromes where \nrisk is assessed as being highest - in this case to\
  \ certificated aerodromes and non-certificated \naerodromes engaged in regular passenger\
  \ transport operations using 19-seat or more aircraft. \nThe CAA does not have the\
  \ resources available to it to monitor all aerodromes 'equally'. \nHowever, CAA\
  \ staff (e.g., aviation safety advisers, etc), actively engage with aerodrome users\
  \ \nand others to identify risks and associated mitigations. \nConsequently, I accept\
  \ the recommendation in principle, with the caveat that the CAA's \nactions and\
  \ engagement are driven by: \n\uF0B7 Assessment of risk; and \n\uF0B7 Targeting\
  \ resources to areas of highest risk. \nThis is the CAA's current practice, which\
  \ will continue. \n3.63. Under CARs, the operators of non-certificated aerodromes\
  \ were only required to \nestablish procedures to ensure the safe movement of aircraft\
  \ \"on parts of an \naerodrome where an unsafe condition exists\" and monitor and\
  \ report \"traffic \nmovement data\" for the aerodrome. As a result, CAA oversight\
  \ of aerodromes was \noften limited to non-regular visits by aviation safety advisors\
  \ and possibly other staff. \nCertificated aerodrome operators by comparison were\
  \ subject to greater regulatory \ndirection and interaction with the CAA, for example\
  \ regular audits.  \n \n\n<< Page 32 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006   3.64. On 1\
  \ October 2020, the Commission wrote to the CAA seeking an update on the \nCAA's\
  \ role regarding non-certificated aerodromes and the application of the HSWA. \n\
  The CAA replied, in part, that: \n\u2026a risk-based approach is an inherent feature\
  \ of New Zealand's aviation safety regulatory \nsystem. It is also articulated in\
  \ the CAA's Regulatory Operating Model; a model that \nrecognises regulatory resources\
  \ are not unlimited and must be deployed in a risk-based \napproach in which the\
  \ nature of aviation activity conducted and the impact on any third parties \nof\
  \ safety failure will inform the type and level of oversight.   \nThe priority CAA\
  \ may assign to its oversight of various elements of the aviation sector is \nbased\
  \ on relative risk and not driven by rules or legislation, which are enabling tools.\
  \  \nThe CAA recognises that continued oversight is required for private and recreational\
  \ activity \nin the civil aviation system but assigns less regulatory resources\
  \ to this area due to the general \nlower consequences of failure and impact on\
  \ the safety of third parties. \n3.65. The CAA advised that there was no schedule\
  \ for visiting non-certificated aerodromes. \nVisits by aviation safety advisors,\
  \ for example, are generally driven by Aviation Related \nConcerns (ARCs). The CAA\
  \ advised that an aviation safety advisor had visited the \naerodrome on 12 occasions\
  \ in the five years leading up to the accident. Four of the \nvisits were for meetings\
  \ with a specific person or operator and one to attend an \nairshow. The purpose\
  \ and content of the remaining visits were not recorded. There \nwas no record of\
  \ any meeting with the aerodrome manager or attendance at any of \nthe aerodrome\
  \ user group meetings. \n3.66. The CAA's priority was on higher capacity operations\
  \ where the risk consequences of \nan accident were potentially far greater. The\
  \ risk-based approach was heavily reliant \non the CAA receiving information, for\
  \ example ARCs, that might generate an increased \nlevel of engagement. However,\
  \ because of the under-reporting referred to in \nparagraphs 3.42 and 3.43, the\
  \ level of risk for unattended aerodromes may be \nsignificantly higher than suggested\
  \ by the available information. \n3.67. Despite the overlap of HSWA responsibilities\
  \ between the CAA and WorkSafe New \nZealand about the ground and air operations\
  \ in an aerodrome, the two organisations \nhad no coordinated approach in this area.\
  \ WorkSafe New Zealand advised that its \nengagement with aerodromes was limited\
  \ to post-accident investigations only. There \nwas no proactive support of key\
  \ participants at an aerodrome, in particular for \naerodrome managers. \n3.68.\
  \ Most small unattended aerodromes with low traffic volumes are privately owned.\
  \ \nOther larger unattended aerodromes with a mix of private and commercial operations\
  \ \nlike Masterton are mainly owned and operated by local councils. Commission \n\
  investigators visited several of these aerodromes to determine if some of the issues\
  \ \nidentified at Masterton were also present elsewhere.  \n3.69. Most of the aerodrome\
  \ managers spoken to did not have an aviation background. In \nsome cases, they\
  \ had been given the role based on their experience managing council \ngreen spaces.\
  \ As one manager said, they knew how to grow and cut grass and \naerodromes typically\
  \ had a lot of grass.   \n3.70. None of the aerodrome managers spoken to had been\
  \ given any formal training in \nthis role. Instead, they either learnt on the job\
  \ or sought guidance from other \naerodrome managers. The managers were aware they\
  \ were required to ensure a safe \noperating area for aircraft and provide the CAA\
  \ with an annual report of traffic \n \n  Final Report AO-2019-006 \n<< Page 33\
  \ >>\n movement data.39 However, the understanding of what this constituted and\
  \ how it \nwas to be presented varied. This suggests a need for associated training\
  \ and support \nto help ensure the safe operation of their aerodromes. \n3.71. Most\
  \ managers spoken to were aware of CAA's Advisory Circular, AC139-17-\nAerodrome\
  \ User Groups, and said that they did have a 'user group' on the aerodrome. \nHowever,\
  \ the frequency of meetings and the effectiveness of the groups varied.  \nRole\
  \ of other organisations \n3.72. Commission investigators spoke to WorkSafe New\
  \ Zealand, NZ Airports Association \nand Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) representatives.\
  \ The NZ Airports \nAssociation membership consisted of some 80 members, including\
  \ about 37 \naerodrome operators. Of this about 10 were non-certificated and unattended\
  \ \naerodromes. The chief executive advised that much of the effort was directed\
  \ to larger \ncommercial aerodromes, but they were still concerned about the support\
  \ and \nmanagement of the smaller aerodromes. Their reach into this area was, however,\
  \ \nlimited given the small number of members from this section of the aviation\
  \ industry.  \n3.73. LGNZ is the representative organisation for all 78 local government\
  \ councils in New \nZealand.40 It therefore has the ability, through its membership,\
  \ to directly connect with \nthe owners and managers of aerodromes like Masterton.\
  \ LGNZ representatives spoken \nto confirmed that LGNZ had had no interaction with\
  \ the CAA about the support of \ncouncils and aerodrome managers in the safe operation\
  \ of aerodromes.  \nWorkSafe New Zealand \n3.74. In the CAA's letter dated 30 October\
  \ 2020, referred to in paragraph 2.76, the CAA \nadvised that the CAA's participation\
  \ in activities on non-certificated aerodromes was \nlimited and that \"safe aviation\
  \ practices were actively promoted through visits by CAA \naviation safety advisers\"\
  . However, the CAA's interaction with the aerodrome manager, \nthe aerodrome user\
  \ group and other key players at Masterton was sporadic, a \nsituation that was\
  \ repeated at other non-certificated aerodromes around the country.  \n3.75. The\
  \ CAA also commented that WorkSafe New Zealand was \"the lead safety regulatory\
  \ \nagency for aerodromes as a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU)\
  \ \nunder their HSWA obligations\". The CAA's engagement was therefore effectively\
  \ \nlimited to the operation of aircraft. Some of the aerodrome managers spoken\
  \ to were \nnot aware that under the HSWA they were considered a PCBU. \n3.76. An\
  \ aerodrome by its very nature involves both aerial and ground activities. It would\
  \ \ntherefore seem logical that both the CAA and WorkSafe New Zealand would engage\
  \ \nwith the various operators or organisations on an aerodrome to help promote\
  \ safer \nactivities taking place on and around an aerodrome.  \n3.77. The Commission\
  \ could find no evidence of any collaborative approach by the CAA and \nWorkSafe\
  \ New Zealand about aerodromes. WorkSafe New Zealand representatives \nspoken to\
  \ by the Commission confirmed that the only interaction WorkSafe New \nZealand had\
  \ had with aerodromes was to do with regulatory enforcement action. \nWorkSafe New\
  \ Zealand confirmed that there was the potential for a more proactive \nsafety-focused\
  \ engagement. Logically, this should be done in coordination with the \n \n39 CAR\
  \ 139.505. \n40 LGNZ website, current at the time of releasing this report. \n \n\
  \n<< Page 34 >>\n Final Report AO-2019-006   CAA and potentially involve representative\
  \ organisations like LGNZ. More formalised \nsupport for aerodrome managers could\
  \ also result in improved safety efforts and \nresults. \nPilot qualifications \n\
  3.78. On 11 May 2019, the pilot of ZK-CBY was issued a parachute drop rating in\
  \ \naccordance with CAR 61.651.41 The Rule required the pilot to hold at least a\
  \ private \npilot licence and have accrued at least 200 hours of flight time, including\
  \ 100 hours as \npilot-in-command. The pilot's logbook showed that the pilot met\
  \ this requirement, \nhaving accrued a total of 270 hours, including 107 hours as\
  \ pilot-in-command. The \nrating permitted the pilot to perform non-commercial parachute\
  \ drops.  \n3.79. The holder of an adventure aviation operator certificate was required\
  \ under CAR \n115.55942 to ensure that its pilot(s), including the pilot of ZK-CBY,\
  \ met the following \nrequirements: \na. hold a current commercial pilot licence,\
  \  \nb. hold a current parachute drop rating, \nc. hold an aircraft type rating\
  \ for the type of aircraft to be used, and \nd. acquired at least 150 hours flight\
  \ time as pilot-in-command of the category of \naircraft to be used for parachuting.\
  \  \n3.80. The operator's Operations Manual also stipulated a minimum of \"at least\
  \ 200 hours \nflight time as pilot & at least 150 hours as PIC [pilot-in-command]\"\
  . \n3.81. The pilot's logbook showed that on 17 May 2019, when undertaking the competency\
  \ \nassessment check flight to be able to conduct commercial parachuting, they had\
  \ \naccrued a total of 108.6 hours only as pilot-in-command. At the time of the\
  \ accident \nthat pilot had accrued a total of 288 flight hours, including 123 hours\
  \ as pilot-in-\ncommand. The pilot of ZK-CBY therefore did not meet the 150-hour\
  \ 'pilot-in-\ncommand' requirement. \n3.82. The operator, the instructor who did\
  \ the training and the flight examiner who \nperformed the assessment were all aware\
  \ of the 150-hour requirement. However, they \nwere unaware that the pilot did not\
  \ have the required flight hours at the time of the \nassessment. Both the instructor\
  \ and examiner contended that the pilot of ZK-CBY, \nwhile not meeting the hours\
  \ requirement, was nevertheless competent to perform the \ntasks of a parachute\
  \ drop pilot. The pilot had completed 28 parachuting drop runs \nbefore the accident\
  \ flight.  \n3.83. The form used for the parachuting competency assessment did not\
  \ make provision for \na pilot's 'pilot-in-command' hours to be recorded, only the\
  \ total time flown. See Other \nsafety actions , paragraph 5.24, for further comment.\
