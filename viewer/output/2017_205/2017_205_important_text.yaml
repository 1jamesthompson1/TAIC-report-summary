  \  \n4.1.1.  Shipboard fires can be very destructive , and if left unchecked can\
  \ easily result in the total loss \nof a vessel, with a high potential for loss\
  \ of life.  Because fires can occur while ship s are  at \nsea, away from any shore\
  \ -based assistance, the SOLAS requirements are aimed at making \nthem  fully self\
  \ -sufficient in their firefight ing capability, and at ensuring that crews are\
  \ fully \ntrained in shipboard firefight ing techniques.  \n4.1.2.  Due to their\
  \ design and construction, and the  potential risk of capsize due to loss of stability,\
  \ \nthere are a number of unique aspects to fighting fires on board ships.  The\
  \ Kokopo Chief  being  \nin port when the fire occurred required the merging of\
  \ two disciplines : ship and shore -based \nfirefight ing techniques.  \n4.1.3.\
  \  The following analysis discusses the circumstances leading up to the fire, and\
  \ some of the \nchallenges the incident management  team had to overcome while fighting\
  \ the fire.  It also \ndiscusses the following safety issues:  \n\uF0B7 the operator's\
  \ safety management system had not fully mitigated the risk of fire caused \nby\
  \ cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar circumstances\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding\
  \ to the fire were not \nclearly documented and understood by all parties  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for\
  \ responding \nto shipboard fires.  \n4.2. What happened  \nSafety issue  - The\
  \ operator's safety management system had not fully mitig ated the risk of \nfire\
  \ caused by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar\
  \ \ncircumstances . \n4.2.1.  The burn pattern on the timber cargo adjacent to the\
  \ cargo hold light was a strong indication \nthat the heat  generated by the reflector\
  \  lamp was the cause of the fire .  The only other \npotential source s of heat\
  \ found in the cargo hold were  two old cigarette butts found in the \nhold.  However,\
  \  both were found at the opposite end of the hold to the fire location.  One had\
  \ \nbeen well stubbed out an d the other had been discarded behind a cell guide21\
  \ and could not \nhave come into contact with any cargo.  \n4.2.2.  The FENZ specialist\
  \ fire investigator reported that  a 200  W lamp would have been  capable of \n\
  radiating enough heat to cause the timber to burn.  There was no data available\
  \ for the 500 W \nbulb that was installed  in the cargo hold.  The obvious conclusion\
  \ is that  it would have been  \ncapable of radiating more heat than a 200  W bulb\
  \ , but how  much was not known.  \n4.2.3.  The FENZ  report found that t hermal\
  \ decomposition of the timber would have likely started at \nanywhere from 100\xB0\
  C and reached a maximum rate by 180\xB0C.  Ignition would have been  \nexpected\
  \ to occur at around 300\xB0C22. \n4.2.4.  The deep scorching of th e timber that\
  \ was stowed directly opposite the 500 W lamp show ed \nthat enough heat  was radiated\
  \ from the light to melt the plastic wrapping and cause the \nexposed timber to\
  \ smoulder (see Figures 9 and 10).  This timber was estimated to have been \nloaded\
  \ as cl ose as 45 -50 mm from the face of the lamp.  Over time the plastic wrap\
  \ melted to \nexpose the timber ends , which became hot enough to start a smouldering\
  \ fire.  \n                                                        \n21 A right\
  \ -angled, vertical guide rail that helps to keep shipping containers straight in\

  \ MO -2017 -205 4.2.5.  Because the use of high -powered incandescent  reflector\
  \ lamps  in ships' cargo holds is \ncommonplace in the worldwide fleet, the Commission\
  \  considered that the hypothesis of the \ncargo lamp being the  source of the fire\
  \ was worth testing under simulated conditions.  \n4.2.6.  The tests confirmed that\
  \ it was virtually certain  that the cargo lamp  produce d sufficient heat to \n\
  ignite the timber cargo.  T he proximity of the cargo to the lamp would have restricted\
  \ any \nairflow  and its cooling effect on the lamp , and facilitated  rapid heat\
  \ transfer by radiation \nbetween the lamp and the timber.  \n4.2.7.  While it is\
  \ widely known that incandescent  lamps produce heat, these findings offer valuable\
  \ \ninformation to ship designers, owners and operators to consider when selecting\
  \ the means of \nlighting in their ships' cargo holds.  There are equivalent lighting\
  \ options , such as LED lamps23, \nthat do not pro duce the same high temperatures\
  \ . \n4.2.8.  Another measure that can be taken to mitigate the risk of similar\
  \ fires is having procedures in \nplace for ensuring that cargo hold lighting systems\
  \ are turned off (and , if necessary, isolated) \nat an appropriate time before\
  \ a loading operation creates the hazard.  In this case, the lights \ncould have\
  \ been switched off and/or isolated as soon as the timber packs were placed over\
  \ \nthe lighting recess.  \n4.2.9.  Normally the cargo hold lights were checked\
  \ and switched off when the crew prep ared the \nship for leaving port.  However,\
  \ this was not included in any written procedure or checklist.  \n4.2.10.  In 2014\
  \ a near -miss report was circulated to the  operator's  fleet after timber cargo\
  \ on one of \nits vessels had scorched  when the cargo hold lights were left on\
  \ (see Appendix 1).  \n4.2.11.  Despite the  previous  incident  the operator had\
  \ not  included the risk of fire caused by hot \ncargo lamps  in its fleet safety\
  \ management system . \n4.2.12.  The operator has since addressed this safety issue\
  \ ( see section 7) . \n4.2.13.  In order to promote the lessons  from this accident,\
  \ the Commission has made \nrecommendations to the International Association of\
  \ Classification Societies and the \nInternational Group of P&I Clubs24 to alert\
  \ ship designers, owners and operators , and \nsurveyors and auditors of safety\
  \ management systems , to the risks posed by lamps that \nproduce high heat, such\
  \ as incandescent reflector lamps.  \n4.3. Emergency response  - responsibilities\
  \  \nSafety issue - The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in\
  \ responding to the fire \nwere not clearly documented and understood by all parties\
  \ . \n4.3.1.  Chapter III, regulation 8 of SOLAS requires every crew member on a\
  \ ship  to be provided with \nclear instructions to be followed in the event of\
  \ an emergency.  The instructio ns are to be \nexhibited in conspicuous places throughout\
  \ the ship , such as the bridge and the engine \ncontrol room.  \n4.3.2.  SOLAS\
  \ Chapter IX, regulation 3 requires ship operators to comply with the requirements\
  \ of the \nInternational Safety Management Code (ISM Code).   The ISM Code states\
  \ that a ship operator \nshould identify potential emergency shipboard situations\
  \ and establish procedures to respond \nto them.  \n4.3.3.  Operators are  also\
  \ obliged to exercise emergency procedures and prepare for emergency \nactions.\
  \  Specifically, the SOLAS requirements include at least one abandon -ship drill\
  \ and one \nfire drill each month for every crew member.  \n4.3.4.  The ISM Code\
  \ requires an operator to define clearly a master's responsibility and overriding\
  \ \nauthority to make decisions with respect to the safety of their  ship and its\
  \ crew, and the \n                                                        \n23 A\
  \ lamp that produces  light using  a light-emitting diode (LED).  \n24  Protection\
  \ and indemnity insurance organisations.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017 -205 \n<< Page\
  \ 17 >>\n prevention of pollution.  These requirements are reflected in New Zealand's\
  \ Maritime \nTransport Act 1994, which states that  the master has \"final authority\
  \ to control the ship while \nin command \" and is \"responsible for compliance\
  \ with all relevant requirements except in an \nemergency when immediate action\
  \ in breach of this Act may be necessary \"25. \n4.3.5.  The fire procedure contained\
  \ in the Kokopo Chief's Emergency Preparedness and Emergency \nResponse Plan state\
  \ d, \"if there is immediate risk to life or the safety of the ship, summon \nnecessary\
  \ assistance \".  Once the master had established that the fire risk was too great\
  \ for \nthe ship's crew to make a direct attack on the fire, the decisions  to use\
  \ the ship's CO 2 fire-\nextinguishing system and request the assistance of the\
  \ local fire service  were in accordance \nwith the procedure .  \n4.3.6.  One of\
  \ the main functions of FENZ  is to provide fire prevention, response and suppression\
  \ \nservices26.  An additional function is to respond to maritime incidents to the\
  \ extent of their \ncapacity and capability27. \n4.3.7.  FENZ has five regions covering\
  \ mainland New Zealand , and each region has its own planning \nand procedures.\
  \  Tauranga is part of region 2 - Hamilton, Thames, Tauranga, Rotorua and \nGisborne.\
  \  The Region 2 Ship Fires Operating Procedure requires FENZ to provide an initial\
  \ \nresponse of two firefight ing units and to manage any shipboard fire response\
  \ with the \nCoordinated Incident Management System (CIMS).  \n4.3.8.  The purpose\
  \ of CIMS is to achieve effectiv e incident management during a multi -agency \n\
  response.  Common structures, functions and terminology have been established across\
  \ \nincident response and management agencies throughout New Zealand.  CIMS has\
  \ a flexible \nframework so that a response can be tail ored to specific circumstances\
  \ , yet still allows \nagencies to develop their own processes.  \n4.3.9.  When\
  \ more than one agency has a mandate to manage an incident, CIMS advises the \n\
  establishment of 'unified control' , where the agencies form a combined decision\
  \ -making  body \nand formulate a single action plan.  \n4.3.10.  Port of Tauranga\
  \ also has a procedure for responding to ship fires in its Emergency \nProcedures\
  \ Manual.  This document details the actions and communications required to allow\
  \ \nrelevant agencies access to a vessel an d lists the firefight ing resources\
  \ that the port can \nprovide.  Port of Tauranga has the firefight ing capability\
  \ of its tug boats and a portable \nfirefight ing pump available.  \n4.3.11.  The\
  \ harbourmaster  represents the relevant r egional council by ensuring maritime\
  \ saf ety in the \nports harbours and waters of the ir region.  The harbourmaster\
  \  has powers of direction and \nduties under the Maritime Transport Act for the\
  \ purpose of ensuring maritime safety28. \n4.3.12.  As described above, w hen there\
  \ is  a ship fire in a port there will be  several  agenc ies involved \nin the\
  \  response , and each agency will have its own procedures to follow  with perhaps\
  \ different \npurposes in mind .  However, it is important that there be a clearly\
  \ defined and understood \nposition of  responsibility for the emergency response\
  \ , including a way to resolve any \nprocedural conflicts between the responding\
  \ agencies.  \n4.3.13.  The FENZ Ship Fire Procedure indicate s that the harbourmaster\
  \  is responsible for firefight ing \nduring a ship fire in port , which  is not\
  \ always the case .  Although the harbourmaster  has the \nmandate to intervene\
  \ to ensure  that maritime safety is maintained in the ir region's waters, the \n\
  master remains responsible for the safety of the ship, its crew and its cargo. \
  \ The Port of \nTaurang a Emergency Procedures Manual acknowledges that the responsibility\
  \ for firefight ing \non board a ship in port remains with the master and that the\
  \ fire service will render whatever \nassistance is required.  \n              \
  \                                          \n25 Maritime Transport Act 1994, section\
  \ 19.  \n26 Fire and Emer gency New Zealand Act 2017, section 11.  \n27 Fire and\
  \ Emergency New Zealand Act 2017, section 12.  \n28 Maritime Transport Act 1994,\
  \ sections 33D, E and F.  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report MO -2017 -205 4.3.14.\
  \  When FENZ  responded to the fire on board  the Kokopo Chief , it was  responding\
  \ under its Ship \nFire Procedure , which prescribed that the response be managed\
  \ using the CIMS model .  In \naccordance with the CIMS model, FENZ formed an incident\
  \ management  team that included \nmembers of the ship's crew  and the harbour master\
  \ .  From this perspective the response \nworked well.  \n4.3.15.  The crew of the\
  \ Kokopo Chief had a good command of English  and had a thorough \nunderstanding\
  \ of their  ship's fire emergency procedure, and thus were able  quickly  to \n\
  establish a good working rapport  with FENZ .  When the area  commander arrived\
  \ the first-\nrespond ing station officers were  already working well with the ship's\
  \ crew.  \n4.3.16.  However, t he FENZ  Ship Fire Procedure did not accurately reflect\
  \  the obligations of the master \nand the harbourmaster , which under different\
  \ circumstances with different people involved \ncould have been  problematic. \
  \  The Commission has made a  recommendation to FENZ  to \naddress this safety issue\
  \ . \n4.4. Method of firefighting  \nSafety issue - The FENZ training standards\
  \ did not fully cover the special considerations for \nresponding to shipboard fires.\
  \  \n4.4.1.  As already mentioned, there are a number of unique aspects to fighting\
  \ fires on board ships .  \nAlthough the incident management team was functioning\
  \ well, in this case the  inclination  of \nthe FENZ  staff involved was to attack\
  \  the fire  directly , whereas the design of the sh ip's \nfirefight ing systems\
  \  required a 'stand back , boundary cool , monitor and wait ' approach.  \n4.4.2.\
  \  The ship's crew had already released the first 48 bottles of CO 2 into the hold\
  \ when  the first  \nFENZ units  arrived.  The  ship's CO 2 system operating  procedure\
  \ then instructed the release of \none bottle every 15 minutes until  all bottles\
  \ were used.  The hold should ideally have been left \nsealed for as long as possible\
  \  to allow  the CO 2 to tak e effect  and prevent oxygen entering.  The \nmaster\
  \ 's options were  either to follow the  ship's  procedure exactly or to make a\
  \ departure \nfrom th e procedure for a more direct attack . \n4.4.3.  Ultimately\
  \ the decision was made to  break the seal on one of the hatch lid s.  Straightaway\
  \ , \nheavy smoke was observed emitting from under the hatch lid.  It is very likely\
  \ that some of the \nCO2 gas escaped and some oxygen was introduced to the cargo\
  \ hold at that time.  \n4.4.4.  The hatch lid was then re -sealed  and a good decision\
  \ made for the remaining 24 bottles to be \nreleased into the hold all at once \
  \ to replenish any CO 2 potentially lost . \n4.4.5.  The decision was then made\
  \ to stand back, monitor and wait.  This action resulted in the fire \nbeing extinguished\
  \ with the sole use of the on -board systems . \n4.4.6.  There would be some benefit\
  \ in FENZ including more information and training for its crews on \nfighting fires\
  \ on board ships in port or near coastal situations.  This would go some way to\
  \  \nachieving a more common approach when ship and shore -based crews are jointly\
  \ involved in \nshipboard firefight ing operations.  This would also help when responding\
  \ to ship fires in \nsituations where the crew are not as familiar and practised\
  \ at firefight ing as the crew on board \nthe Koko po Chief  were , or other situations\
  \ where the crew might not be involved  at all . \n4.4.7.  A recommendation has\
  \ been made to FENZ to address this safety issue.  \n  \n \nFinal Report MO -2017\
