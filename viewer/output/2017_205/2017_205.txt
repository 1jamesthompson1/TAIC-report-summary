The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly  it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and  
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occ urrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
membe rs of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 23 September 2017, the multipurpose /container  vessel Kokopo Chief  was loading a cargo 
of containers and general cargo at Port of Tauranga.  
1.2. Number 4  cargo  hold was completed  with tiers of packaged timber, after which the hatch lid 
was closed and containers loaded on top.   Cargo operations were completed by about 2230 
and the crew stood down to rest before the vessel’s departure, which was scheduled for early 
the next morning.  
1.3. Shortly before midnight the ship’s smoke -detection system alarmed, alerting the crew to a fire 
that had broken out in number 4 cargo hold.  The crew response to the fire included activating 
the ship’s fixed carbon dioxide ( CO2) fire-extinguishing system , which involved sealing the 
cargo hold and releasing liquid CO 2 into the  cargo  hold.  
1.4. The master alerted harbour control, which  called the local  fire service, responded and 
combined with the ship’s crew to form a joint fire command team and a fire control te am.  The 
fire control team monitored the temperatures of the steel surfaces around the cargo hold , 
which indicated that the fire was being suppressed by the CO 2 gas in the hold.  
1.5. A decision was made to unload  the containers on top of the hatch and partially  open one of 
the lid s.  However, s moke was emitted from under the hatch lid, so it was replaced and any 
remaining bottles of liquid CO 2 were released  into the cargo hold.  
1.6. After several hours the temperature s had decreased, so the hatch lid was removed.  Th ere 
were no obvious signs of fire, so the timber packs were unloaded  and any remaining hot spots 
attended to.  
1.7. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the fire was 
caused by heat radiating from a n incandescent reflector lamp  that set fire to packs of timber 
that had been stowed close to the lamp .  The cargo hold lights had not been switched off on 
completion of loading.  
1.8. The Commission also found  that the ship’s fixed CO 2 fire-extinguishing  system was effective, 
but that the f ire could have been extinguished sooner if the hatch had not been opened 
earlier.  
1.9. The Commission also found that the response to the fire was well co -ordinated, but identified 
the following safety issues : 
 the operator ’s safety management system had not ful ly mitigated the risk of fire 
caused by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar 
circumstances  
 the responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were 
not clearly documented and understood by al l parties  
 the Fire and Emergency New Zealand  training standards did not fully cover the special 
considerations for responding to shipboard fires.  
1.10.  The operator took a number of safety actions  to address the first safety issue.  The 
Commission made two recommendations  to Fire and Emergency New Zealand to address the 
other safety issues.  The Commission also made recommendations  to the International 
Association of Classification Societies and the International Group of P&I Clubs  to disseminate 
the lessons  learned from this accident to the global shipping fleet.  
1.11.  Key lessons arising from this inquiry included:  
 safety procedures such as switching off cargo hold lights should be documented and 
include system s for checking that they have been carried out  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report MO -2017 -205  some lamp  types  generate a substantial amount of heat that can be a fire hazard.  
Ship owners and operators should consider using other types of lamp that do not 
generate high heat in locations where the risk of fire is present  
 the required firefighting systems on board ships are unique to the special design and 
construction of the ships.  When possible , they should be fully utilised in accordance 
with the operati ng instructions.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Maritime New Zealand notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) 
of the fire at about 04002 on 24 September 2017.  The Commission opened an inquiry the 
same day under section 13(1)b  of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , 
and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On 24 September the Commission notified the flag state, Hong Kong3, and informed it that the 
Commission had opened an inquiry.  
2.3. Later that day two investi gators travelled to Tauranga and met with the master and the deputy 
designated person ashore4.  The investigator s spent the following two days collecting evidence 
and interviewing crew members.  
2.4. On 25 September the Commission requested the assistance of  a specialist fire investigator 
from Fire a nd Emergency New Zealand (FENZ)5 to inspect the scene and report on the cause 
of the fire.  The investigators also met with the  FENZ  area commander , Bay of Plenty  Coast 
Area . 
2.5. On 27 September the investigators met with  the harbourmaster and the Port of Tauranga 
operations manager.  
2.6. On 2 October the Hong Kong Maritime Authority confirmed that it did not intend to carry out its 
own investigation , but as a substantially interested state requested a copy of the draft report 
for comment . 
2.7. On 29 January 2018 further evidence was received from The China Navigation Company 
Limited (the operator ), including a near -miss report on a potential fire on board one of its other 
vessels in 2014 . 
2.8. On 16 February 2018 the investigator in charge  conducted a telephone interview with the  
FENZ area  commander  to gather more information about FENZ ship fire fighting  procedures.  
2.9. On 21 February 2018 further information was received from the harbourmaster about ship 
firefighting  procedures from the harbourmaster ’s perspective.  
2.10.  On 24 April 2018 the Commission conducted a simulation to establish the temperatures 
generated by the reflector lamp  and test whether these would have been sufficient to ignite 
the timber cargo . 
2.11.  On 20 June 2018 the Commission a pproved the draft report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.12.  The draft report was circulated to 12 interested persons.  Nine responses, including four 
submissions , were received.  
2.13.  The Commission considered the submissions in detail and any c hanges as a result have been 
included in the final report.  
2.14.  The Commission approved the report for publication on  19 September 2018 .

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The Kokopo Chief  is a geared6, multipurpose container ship with four cargo holds serviced by  
three deck cranes.  
3.1.2.  The ship is owned and operated by The China Navigation Company  Limited and runs a regular 
trans -Tasman service between Australia and New Zealand.  
3.1.3.  The ship is  registered in Hong Kong and classed by Lloyd’s Register.  There was a 
multinational crew on board and th e working language of the ship was English.  
3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  On 23 September 2017 the Kokopo Chief  was working cargo alongside at Port of Tauranga , 
loading ti mber packs, machinery and containers . 
3.2.2.  The fourth  officer took over the deck watch a t 1800 , when  number 4 cargo hold had been 
loaded but the cargo had yet to be  lashed by the shore -based stevedores7. 
3.2.3.  Once the cargo inside the hold was lashed to the satisfaction of the fourth  officer, the hatch  
cover  was closed.  
3.2.4.  The stevedores then loaded  some machinery on the main deck and, finally, loaded dangerous 
goods containers on top of number 4 hatch  cover .  The  stevedores then lashed  the deck 
cargo.  Cargo and lashing operations were logged as complete at 2224.  
3.2.5.  After the completion of cargo operations, the ship went to a ‘single watch’ , which meant that 
one crew member was stationed at the top of the ship’s gang way while the remaining crew 
rested before the expected departure time of 0400  the following day .  The fourth  officer went 
to take some  rest, but remained contactable  by radio.  
3.2.6.  The ship was fitted with a Safetec SDS -48 sample -extraction smoke -detection sys tem.  This 
system continuously drew air samples from the cargo holds.  These air samples pass ed 
through a smoke sensor located on the navigating bridge.   If the density of the smoke reache d 
defined criteria, the smoke alarm would be  activated.  
3.2.7.  Shortly befo re midnight a cargo hold smoke -detection a larm sounded throughout the crew  
accommodation.   The master went to the bridge and saw that the smoke -detector panel was 
indicating the presence of smoke at the forward end of number 4 cargo hold.  The master  
checked the cargo hold light panel and saw that the lights were switched on in all of the cargo 
holds , so switched them off immediately.  
3.2.8.  The chief officer and the fourth  officer went to the starboard -side under -deck passageway, 
where there was an access h atch to number 4 cargo hold  (see Figure 1).  They lifted the lid of 
the access hatch and smel led burning , so immediately closed the lid .  They  reported to the 
bridge that there was a fire and that it was not a false alarm.  
3.2.9.  The chief officer and the fourth  officer returned to their designated emergency muster point, 
the ship’s emergency headquarters.  The general alarm was activated to summon any crew 
who had not already m ustered on first hearing the smoke alarm.  
3.2.10.  The ship’s crew began to prepare the firefigh ting equipment.  A first fire team of two men 
donned fire suits and self -contained breathing apparatus.  The fire team, together with the 
chief officer and the fourth  officer , returned to the access hatch and prepared for the fire team 
to enter  number 4 ca rgo hold.  This time when the access hatch was opened, smoke could

 clearly be seen coming from the cargo hold.   The first fire team then entered the cargo hold 
with the intention of locating and fighting the fire.  
3.2.11.  A second fire team was sent to check the b ulkhead8 temperatures on the outside of number 4 
cargo hold.  They reported that the temperature of the starboard forward corner of number 4 
cargo hold was five degrees higher than anywhere else.  
3.2.12.  The first fire team soon found  that their access was blocked by containers and that visibility 
was limited due to heavy smoke.  The chief officer told them to stop and get out of the hold.  
3.2.13.  At 0016 the master advised Port of Tauranga Radio  that there was smoke in the cargo hold, 
but no fire had been seen . 
3.2.14.  When the fire team was clear of number 4 cargo hold, the access hatch was closed and the 
crew evacuated from the starboard -side under -deck passageway.  They returned to the 
emergency headquarters, after which the master ordered a head count to be carried out.  
3.2.15.  At 0049 the master contacted Port of Tauranga Radio to report that the ship had a cargo hold 
fire and required assistance from the local fire service.  The master  also advised of the 
intention  to activate the ship’s  carbon dioxide  (CO2) fire-extinguishing system.  
3.2.16.  Once all crew members were accounted for, the master ordered the chief engineer to prepare 
to activate the CO 2 fire-extinguishing system in number 4 cargo hold.  The crew were sent to 
ensure that all ventilation openings to the c argo hold were closed and that it was fully sealed.  
At 0058 the master ordered the chief engineer to release 48 bottles of CO 2 into number 4 
cargo hold, the required number  of bottles  for the initial release according to the CO 2 system 
operati ng procedure . 
3.2.17.  Following the activation of the CO 2 system, the chief engineer reported to the master that 
there was a small leak on the CO 2 system manifold.  The master ordered the chief engineer to 
leave the CO 2 room and to return wearing breathing apparatus to repair the manifold .  The 
chief engineer carried out this order . 
3.2.18.  At about 0103 the first FENZ  unit from Mount Maunganui arrived alongside the ship.  Shortly 
afterwards a unit from Tauranga fire station arr ived.  The senior station officer from Tauranga 
fire station went on board and was briefed by the ship’s crew.  The station officer from Mount 
Maunganui remained on the quay to supervise the FENZ  staff ashore.   
3.2.19.  The master appointed the chief officer and t he fourth  officer to liaise with FENZ personnel .  At 
this stage the CO 2 had just been released and the master was waiting for it to take effect.  The 
ship’s crew had started using fire hoses to boundary cool9 the hatch cover  and hatch 
coaming10.  They were also monitoring the temperature on the bulkheads of number 4 cargo 
hold from the starboard -side under -deck passageway.  These actions continued for some time 
using a combination of ship and FENZ  personnel.  
3.2.20.  The master spoke wi th the company’s designated person ashore on the phone.  They 
considered the risks presented by dangerous goods and fuel oil stowage and agreed that the 
dangerous goods containers needed to be unloaded  from the ship.  The master phoned the 
ship’s planner a nd asked the planner to  arrange for stevedores to unload  these containers.  
Heavy fuel oil was transferred out of a fuel tank near number 4 cargo hold and sea water was 
pumped into a ballast tank underneath the cargo hold for a boundary cooling effect.

 3.2.21.  The FENZ  area commander arrived at 0149  and assessed that FENZ  senior officers and the 
ship’s crew had the firef ighting response under control .  As there were no outward signs of the 
fire, the area commander did not take control of the FENZ  response  at that time . 
3.2.22.  At about 0155 the cargo hold bulkhead temperatures were reported to have decreased.  
Volunteer stevedores soon arrived and unloaded  the dan gerous goods containers.  At this 
stage there were still no external signs of the fire in the hold.  The master, the chief officer and 
fire officers agreed to open the hatch lid as soon as the remain ing containers were 
discharged.  
3.2.23.  At 0320 ( now NZDT) the sh ip’s crew removed the hatch cleats11 and opened a hatch lid 
slightly .  Heavy smoke emitted from the cargo hold , so the lid was replaced  and the cleats re -
secured .  The master then decided to release the remaining 2 4 bottles of CO 2 into the hold.    
3.2.24.  The area commander  saw that the fire was more  serious th an first thought, and assumed the 
position of incident controller , with FENZ  as the lead agency.  The status of the FENZ response  
was upgraded  so that extra assets were sent to assist.  An incident manag ement team was 
established to discuss and formulate an action plan to minimise the effects of the fire .  The 
master was part of the incident management team and retained command and control of the 
ship and its systems and crew.  
3.2.25.  At 0448  the hatch cleats wer e opened again and the boundary cooling teams withdrew in 
preparation for another a ttempt at opening the hatch  and making a direct attack on the fire 
using water .  However, a compliance officer from the  Bay of Plenty  Regional C ouncil  advised 
that the ship would not be able to discharge any soiled firefight ing water into the harbour.  
Stability checks were carried out to establish how much water could be used and retained on 
board without compromising the ship’s stability . 
3.2.26.  At 0540 the i ncident management team noted a one -degree drop in  temperature on the cargo 
hold bulkheads .  Taking this as a n indication  that the CO 2 was having an effect , they decided  
to leave the hatch sealed for several hours to allow the CO 2 to continue working.   During this 
time temperature monitoring continue d on the cargo hold bulkheads.  
3.2.27.  About four hours later the  incident management team agreed that another attempt would be 
made to open the hold.  Fire teams were re ady to fight any fire using  a direct attack with 
water.  The ship’s stability condition was confirmed as adequate .  However,  the harbourmaster  
overruled the earlier decision made by the compliance officer  and allow ed firefight ing water to 
be discharged overboard  if necessary  to main tain adequate ship stability .  They planned to 
place a containment  boom to restrict  any potential pollution .  The port’s fire tug Tai Pari  was 
put on standby.  
3.2.28.  At 0945 a briefing  was held to prepare all parties for opening the hatch cover.  As a 
precaution,  containers from the after end of number 3 hatch were also unloaded .  A hatch lid 
was lifted at about 1110 .  No smoke was present in the hold and the fire appeared to have 
been extinguished .

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 3.3. Post-fire examination and testing  
3.3.1.  The timber loaded into number 4 cargo hold consisted of 43 packs of sawn radiata pine12.  
The timber packs at the origin of the fire contained individually  wrapped, kiln -dried , H413 
treated posts , 90 millimetres ( mm) by 90mm.  Each pack had an outer wrapping  of woven 
plastic sheeting.  
3.3.2.  Safety data sheets were reviewed for several brands of treated radiata pine.  They all 
recommend ed avoiding heat and ignition sources when storing and handling treated pine and 
its products.  
3.3.3.  The damaged timber was removed to the  extent necessary to confirm the fire was out.  Figure 
2 shows the state of the cargo hold once the timber packs had been removed.  The worst of 
the smoke and heat damage on the forward bulkhead of the cargo hold indicated  that the seat 
of the fire was in the vicinity of the recessed cargo hold light.

 3.3.4.  The cargo hold lights were fitted with Matsuda  500-watt (W) reflector lamps.  They were each 
housed in a protective cage and recessed into the cargo hold bulkhead so that they would not 
be damaged durin g cargo operations (see Figure 3).  
 
Figure 3 
Cargo hold light in recess ( inset, the reflector lamp ) 
3.3.5.  The face of the lamp  was 40 mm away  from  the inside of the protective cage and the 
protective cage was set in 5  mm from the edge of the recess.  
3.3.6.  The Lloyd’s Register requirements for ships ’ lighting equipment stated that “lamp holders are 
to be constructed of flame retarding non -hygroscopic materials” and that “lighting fittings are 
to be so arranged as to prevent temperature rises which overheat or damage surrounding 
materials”14. Technically, t he lighting installations on board  the Kokopo Chief  complied with 
these rules .  However, the choice of lamp and cargo stowage are beyond the scope of the se 
rules.  
3.3.7.  The timber packs had been  tightly stowed to minimise the risk of the cargo shifting at sea.  
The ends of the timber packs were loaded up against the side of the hold and across the light 
recesses  and would have been about 45 -50 mm from the face of the lamp s. 
3.3.8.  Wood is a commonly used solid fuel.  When it is exposed to high temperatures, wood 
undergoes a chemical decomposition  process that releases  gases, water vapour and various 
products as smoke.  The c ombustion characteristics of wood products vary according to  
factors such as the nature of heat exposure, the size of the sample and the type of wood 
involved15.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 3.3.9.  Incandescent16 reflector  lamps are known to produce  high temperatures.  However, there is 
little data available on the temperatures  they can reach or the intensity of any radiated heat.  
3.3.10.  Because there was no data available for a 500  W reflector lamp, the Commission carri ed out 
tests17 to measure the temperature of a Matsuda 500  W reflector lamp when operated under 
conditions similar to those on board.  A steel box was fabricated with dimensions matching 
those of the light recess in the cargo hold (600  mm x 700  mm x 525  mm) .  Thermocouples18 
were used to measure the temperatures at the centre of the lamp’s face and at the surface of 
the timber opposite the lamp.  A stack of H4 treated , dry radiata pine was placed 50  mm from 
the opening to the box and the lamp was switched on (see Figure  4). 
3.3.11.  Before the lamp reached a maximum temperature, the test had to be stopped because the 
timber had already started to smoulder19 (see Figures 4 and 5).  At the time that smoke was 
first seen the temperature of the lamp was 155°C (degrees Celsi us) and the temperature at 
the surface of the timber was 114°C.  The temperature of the lamp continued to rise and was 
208°C when the test was stopped (see Figure 6).

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 3.3.12.  With no obstruction across the opening to the box, the lamp reached a maxim um temperature 
of 191°C and remained at 188 -190°C.  It was found that placing the timber across the 
opening restricted the airflow around the lamp and prevented heat dissipation.  The lamp 
reached a higher temperature and the heat was concentrated onto a f ocused point on the 
timber, where the smouldering commenced.  
3.3.13.  Several tests were run.  However, when timber was placed at the opening to the steel box the 
tests had to be ceased after three to four minutes for safety reasons.  Consequently, the 
maxim um temp erature the lamp would have reached  could not be determined.  The maximum 
temperature recorded  was 216°C and rising.  
3.3.14.  Samples of the plastic used by the sawmill20 to wrap its timber products were secured over 
the test timber.  The plastic was found to melt, but not ignite, and left the timber exposed to 
the hot lamp (see Figure 7).  The plastic wrapping was not  considered an accelerant.  In fact,  
in the tests the wrapping  delayed the start of the timber combustion for about 30 seconds.

3.4. The CO 2 fire-extinguishing system  
3.4.1.  CO2 fire-extinguishing  systems are the most common found on board ships for fighting fires in 
large enclosed spaces  such as ships’ engine rooms and cargo holds.  They are favoured 
because they are easy to use , cause little or no damage to cargo , and avoid the use of large 
quantities of water , which can cause cargo damage and have stability implications for ship s. 
3.4.2.  On the Kokopo Chief , the CO2 fire-extinguishing system share d common lines with the sample -
extraction smoke -detection system.  The lines through which the smoke -detection air samples 
were  drawn were  used to deliver the fire -extinguishing medi um to the hold s by reversing the 
position of the system valves.  
3.4.3.  For combustion to take place there must be sufficient oxygen, heat and fuel , as portrayed by 
the fire triangle (see Figure 8).  The CO 2 fire-extinguishing system works on the principle that

 enough CO 2 can b e introduced to a compartment to reduce the oxygen content below that 
required to support combustion.  
 
Figure 8 
The fire triangle  
3.4.4.  To maintain the concentrations of CO 2 and oxygen required to extinguish the fire, the  
compartment  must be closed and sealed to prevent the escape of CO 2 and the ingress of 
oxygen.  Because CO 2 provides very little cooling effect, the fire can reignite if oxygen  is 
readmitted to the space too soon.  
3.4.5.  Chapter II -2 of the International Convention for the S afety of Life at Sea , 1974  (SOLAS)  sets 
the requ irements for fire -protection, fire -detection and fire -extinguishing systems on ships.   
The International Code for Fire Safety Systems (FSS Code) defines  the specifications of fire 
safet y equipment and systems  required by SOLAS.  
3.4.6.  Under the FSS Code, the Kokopo Chief  was required to carry enough CO 2 to achieve and 
maintain 30% concentration in its largest protected  cargo  compartment , or 45% concentration 
in the engine room .  There were  72 CO 2 bottles  on board , each holding 45 kilograms of liquid 
CO2.  Any one  of the cargo hold s required an initial release  of 48 bottles followed by one bottle 
every 15 minutes until all 72 cylinders were released .  There was sufficient CO 2 carried on 
board to comply with the FSS Cod e.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Shipboard fires can be very destructive , and if left unchecked can easily result in the total loss 
of a vessel, with a high potential for loss of life.  Because fires can occur while ship s are  at 
sea, away from any shore -based assistance, the SOLAS requirements are aimed at making 
them  fully self -sufficient in their firefight ing capability, and at ensuring that crews are fully 
trained in shipboard firefight ing techniques.  
4.1.2.  Due to their design and construction, and the  potential risk of capsize due to loss of stability, 
there are a number of unique aspects to fighting fires on board ships.  The Kokopo Chief  being  
in port when the fire occurred required the merging of two disciplines : ship and shore -based 
firefight ing techniques.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses the circumstances leading up to the fire, and some of the 
challenges the incident management  team had to overcome while fighting the fire.  It also 
discusses the following safety issues:  
 the operator’s safety management system had not fully mitigated the risk of fire caused 
by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar circumstances  
 the responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not 
clearly documented and understood by all parties  
 the FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding 
to shipboard fires.  
4.2. What happened  
Safety issue  – The operator’s safety management system had not fully mitig ated the risk of 
fire caused by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar 
circumstances . 
4.2.1.  The burn pattern on the timber cargo adjacent to the cargo hold light was a strong indication 
that the heat  generated by the reflector  lamp was the cause of the fire .  The only other 
potential source s of heat found in the cargo hold were  two old cigarette butts found in the 
hold.  However,  both were found at the opposite end of the hold to the fire location.  One had 
been well stubbed out an d the other had been discarded behind a cell guide21 and could not 
have come into contact with any cargo.  
4.2.2.  The FENZ specialist fire investigator reported that  a 200  W lamp would have been  capable of 
radiating enough heat to cause the timber to burn.  There was no data available for the 500 W 
bulb that was installed  in the cargo hold.  The obvious conclusion is that  it would have been  
capable of radiating more heat than a 200  W bulb , but how  much was not known.  
4.2.3.  The FENZ  report found that t hermal decomposition of the timber would have likely started at 
anywhere from 100°C and reached a maximum rate by 180°C.  Ignition would have been  
expected to occur at around 300°C22. 
4.2.4.  The deep scorching of th e timber that was stowed directly opposite the 500 W lamp show ed 
that enough heat  was radiated from the light to melt the plastic wrapping and cause the 
exposed timber to smoulder (see Figures 9 and 10).  This timber was estimated to have been 
loaded as cl ose as 45 -50 mm from the face of the lamp.  Over time the plastic wrap melted to 
expose the timber ends , which became hot enough to start a smouldering fire.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 4.2.5.  Because the use of high -powered incandescent  reflector lamps  in ships’ cargo holds is 
commonplace in the worldwide fleet, the Commission  considered that the hypothesis of the 
cargo lamp being the  source of the fire was worth testing under simulated conditions.  
4.2.6.  The tests confirmed that it was virtually certain  that the cargo lamp  produce d sufficient heat to 
ignite the timber cargo.  T he proximity of the cargo to the lamp would have restricted any 
airflow  and its cooling effect on the lamp , and facilitated  rapid heat transfer by radiation 
between the lamp and the timber.  
4.2.7.  While it is widely known that incandescent  lamps produce heat, these findings offer valuable 
information to ship designers, owners and operators to consider when selecting the means of 
lighting in their ships’ cargo holds.  There are equivalent lighting options , such as LED lamps23, 
that do not pro duce the same high temperatures . 
4.2.8.  Another measure that can be taken to mitigate the risk of similar fires is having procedures in 
place for ensuring that cargo hold lighting systems are turned off (and , if necessary, isolated) 
at an appropriate time before a loading operation creates the hazard.  In this case, the lights 
could have been switched off and/or isolated as soon as the timber packs were placed over 
the lighting recess.  
4.2.9.  Normally the cargo hold lights were checked and switched off when the crew prep ared the 
ship for leaving port.  However, this was not included in any written procedure or checklist.  
4.2.10.  In 2014 a near -miss report was circulated to the  operator’s  fleet after timber cargo on one of 
its vessels had scorched  when the cargo hold lights were left on (see Appendix 1).  
4.2.11.  Despite the  previous  incident  the operator had not  included the risk of fire caused by hot 
cargo lamps  in its fleet safety management system . 
4.2.12.  The operator has since addressed this safety issue ( see section 7) . 
4.2.13.  In order to promote the lessons  from this accident, the Commission has made 
recommendations to the International Association of Classification Societies and the 
International Group of P&I Clubs24 to alert ship designers, owners and operators , and 
surveyors and auditors of safety management systems , to the risks posed by lamps that 
produce high heat, such as incandescent reflector lamps.  
4.3. Emergency response  – responsibilities  
Safety issue – The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire 
were not clearly documented and understood by all parties . 
4.3.1.  Chapter III, regulation 8 of SOLAS requires every crew member on a ship  to be provided with 
clear instructions to be followed in the event of an emergency.  The instructio ns are to be 
exhibited in conspicuous places throughout the ship , such as the bridge and the engine 
control room.  
4.3.2.  SOLAS Chapter IX, regulation 3 requires ship operators to comply with the requirements of the 
International Safety Management Code (ISM Code).   The ISM Code states that a ship operator 
should identify potential emergency shipboard situations and establish procedures to respond 
to them.  
4.3.3.  Operators are  also obliged to exercise emergency procedures and prepare for emergency 
actions.  Specifically, the SOLAS requirements include at least one abandon -ship drill and one 
fire drill each month for every crew member.  
4.3.4.  The ISM Code requires an operator to define clearly a master’s responsibility and overriding 
authority to make decisions with respect to the safety of their  ship and its crew, and the

 prevention of pollution.  These requirements are reflected in New Zealand’s Maritime 
Transport Act 1994, which states that  the master has “final authority to control the ship while 
in command ” and is “responsible for compliance with all relevant requirements except in an 
emergency when immediate action in breach of this Act may be necessary ”25. 
4.3.5.  The fire procedure contained in the Kokopo Chief’s Emergency Preparedness and Emergency 
Response Plan state d, “if there is immediate risk to life or the safety of the ship, summon 
necessary assistance ”.  Once the master had established that the fire risk was too great for 
the ship’s crew to make a direct attack on the fire, the decisions  to use the ship’s CO 2 fire-
extinguishing system and request the assistance of the local fire service  were in accordance 
with the procedure .  
4.3.6.  One of the main functions of FENZ  is to provide fire prevention, response and suppression 
services26.  An additional function is to respond to maritime incidents to the extent of their 
capacity and capability27. 
4.3.7.  FENZ has five regions covering mainland New Zealand , and each region has its own planning 
and procedures.  Tauranga is part of region 2 – Hamilton, Thames, Tauranga, Rotorua and 
Gisborne.  The Region 2 Ship Fires Operating Procedure requires FENZ to provide an initial 
response of two firefight ing units and to manage any shipboard fire response with the 
Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS).  
4.3.8.  The purpose of CIMS is to achieve effectiv e incident management during a multi -agency 
response.  Common structures, functions and terminology have been established across 
incident response and management agencies throughout New Zealand.  CIMS has a flexible 
framework so that a response can be tail ored to specific circumstances , yet still allows 
agencies to develop their own processes.  
4.3.9.  When more than one agency has a mandate to manage an incident, CIMS advises the 
establishment of ‘unified control’ , where the agencies form a combined decision -making  body 
and formulate a single action plan.  
4.3.10.  Port of Tauranga also has a procedure for responding to ship fires in its Emergency 
Procedures Manual.  This document details the actions and communications required to allow 
relevant agencies access to a vessel an d lists the firefight ing resources that the port can 
provide.  Port of Tauranga has the firefight ing capability of its tug boats and a portable 
firefight ing pump available.  
4.3.11.  The harbourmaster  represents the relevant r egional council by ensuring maritime saf ety in the 
ports harbours and waters of the ir region.  The harbourmaster  has powers of direction and 
duties under the Maritime Transport Act for the purpose of ensuring maritime safety28. 
4.3.12.  As described above, w hen there is  a ship fire in a port there will be  several  agenc ies involved 
in the  response , and each agency will have its own procedures to follow  with perhaps different 
purposes in mind .  However, it is important that there be a clearly defined and understood 
position of  responsibility for the emergency response , including a way to resolve any 
procedural conflicts between the responding agencies.  
4.3.13.  The FENZ Ship Fire Procedure indicate s that the harbourmaster  is responsible for firefight ing 
during a ship fire in port , which  is not always the case .  Although the harbourmaster  has the 
mandate to intervene to ensure  that maritime safety is maintained in the ir region’s waters, the 
master remains responsible for the safety of the ship, its crew and its cargo.  The Port of 
Taurang a Emergency Procedures Manual acknowledges that the responsibility for firefight ing 
on board a ship in port remains with the master and that the fire service will render whatever 
assistance is required.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 4.3.14.  When FENZ  responded to the fire on board  the Kokopo Chief , it was  responding under its Ship 
Fire Procedure , which prescribed that the response be managed using the CIMS model .  In 
accordance with the CIMS model, FENZ formed an incident management  team that included 
members of the ship’s crew  and the harbour master .  From this perspective the response 
worked well.  
4.3.15.  The crew of the Kokopo Chief had a good command of English  and had a thorough 
understanding of their  ship’s fire emergency procedure, and thus were able  quickly  to 
establish a good working rapport  with FENZ .  When the area  commander arrived the first-
respond ing station officers were  already working well with the ship’s crew.  
4.3.16.  However, t he FENZ  Ship Fire Procedure did not accurately reflect  the obligations of the master 
and the harbourmaster , which under different circumstances with different people involved 
could have been  problematic.   The Commission has made a  recommendation to FENZ  to 
address this safety issue . 
4.4. Method of firefighting  
Safety issue – The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for 
responding to shipboard fires.  
4.4.1.  As already mentioned, there are a number of unique aspects to fighting fires on board ships .  
Although the incident management team was functioning well, in this case the  inclination  of 
the FENZ  staff involved was to attack  the fire  directly , whereas the design of the sh ip’s 
firefight ing systems  required a ‘stand back , boundary cool , monitor and wait ’ approach.  
4.4.2.  The ship’s crew had already released the first 48 bottles of CO 2 into the hold when  the first  
FENZ units  arrived.  The  ship’s CO 2 system operating  procedure then instructed the release of 
one bottle every 15 minutes until  all bottles were used.  The hold should ideally have been left 
sealed for as long as possible  to allow  the CO 2 to tak e effect  and prevent oxygen entering.  The 
master ’s options were  either to follow the  ship’s  procedure exactly or to make a departure 
from th e procedure for a more direct attack . 
4.4.3.  Ultimately the decision was made to  break the seal on one of the hatch lid s.  Straightaway , 
heavy smoke was observed emitting from under the hatch lid.  It is very likely that some of the 
CO2 gas escaped and some oxygen was introduced to the cargo hold at that time.  
4.4.4.  The hatch lid was then re -sealed  and a good decision made for the remaining 24 bottles to be 
released into the hold all at once  to replenish any CO 2 potentially lost . 
4.4.5.  The decision was then made to stand back, monitor and wait.  This action resulted in the fire 
being extinguished with the sole use of the on -board systems . 
4.4.6.  There would be some benefit in FENZ including more information and training for its crews on 
fighting fires on board ships in port or near coastal situations.  This would go some way to  
achieving a more common approach when ship and shore -based crews are jointly involved in 
shipboard firefight ing operations.  This would also help when responding to ship fires in 
situations where the crew are not as familiar and practised at firefight ing as the crew on board 
the Koko po Chief  were , or other situations where the crew might not be involved  at all . 
4.4.7.  A recommendation has been made to FENZ to address this safety issue.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The fire was caused by heat radiating from a n incandescent  cargo hold lamp  that set fire to 
packs of timber that had been stowed within 45-50 mm of the lamp . 
5.2. The ship had no written procedure or checklist for ensuring  the cargo hold lights were  
switched off before flammable cargo was loaded against cargo light recesses, or when loading 
was complete and hatch lids were  closed.  
5.3. The CO 2 firefighting system and the on -board firefight ing procedures on board the Kokopo 
Chief  were effective in suppressing the fire to a point where the hatch lid could be removed 
with little risk of the fire re -igniting.  
5.4. Although the co-ordinated response to the fire was eventually effective, the responsibilities of 
command  were not clearly documented and understood by the various authorities involved in 
responding to the fire.  
5.5. There is a need for shore -based responders to be more  familiar with the unique aspects of 
fighting fires on board ships , so that they can provide effective response s to fires regardless of 
the circumstances.

7.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
7.2. Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2.1.  The s afety actions taken by the operator included an internal investigation carried out by the 
deputy designated person ashore .  A report was produced that included recommendations 
and led to the following action s. 
7.2.2.  The operator initiated  a programme to chang e the cargo hold lights to  LED lamp s on all MIHO 
class29 multipurpose/container  ships  in the flee t.  At the time of publication , the changes had 
been completed on three of the five MIHO class ships, including the Kokopo Chief , and had 
been started on the other two sister ships.  
7.2.3.  All other ships in The China Navigation Company fleet were checked for high-temperature 
lamps .  The operator has confirmed that they either had their cargo hold lights changed to  use 
LED lamp s or were delivered new with LED l ighting  already fitted.  
7.2.4.  Procedures have been written into the safety management system that require th e lights to be 
switched off and entr ies made in the ships ’ log book s to record when the lights have been 
turned off.  
7.2.5.  Internal messaging and subsequent follow -up with ship managers have been improved to 
ensure  that fleet safety alerts are used effectively t o learn from near misses.  
7.3. Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3.1.  None identified.  
  
                                                        
29 MIHO class refers to the Kokopo Chief and sister ships built at the Miho Zosen shipyard in Japan.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 8. Recommendations  
8.1. General  
8.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to FENZ, Lloyd’s Register 
International and the International Group of P&I Clubs.  
8.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety , it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar acci dents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
8.2. Recommendations  to Fire and Emergency New Zealand  
8.2.1.  It is advisable  that the responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to a 
shipboard fire are clearly documented and understood by all parti es involved.  
The FENZ Ship Fire Procedure did not accurately reflect the obligations of the master and the 
harbourmaster , which under different circumstances with different people involved could be 
problematic.  
On 19 September 2018 , the Commission recommen ded to the Chief Executive Officer  of FENZ  
that he review  its procedures for firefight ing on board ships to ensure  that they accurately 
reflect the mandated  responsibilities of the ship’s master , the harbourmaster  and any other 
person or organisation that could be involved .  (023/18)  
On 4 October 2018, Fire and Emergency New Zealand replied:  
Fire and Emergency is reviewing its Operational Instruction S8 (Ships) to ensure that 
it accurately reflects the respective r esponsibilities of ships' masters, 
harbourmasters, and other agencies or persons who may be involved in emergency 
response activities.  
Fire and Emergency will ensure that similar reviews of local operating procedures 
(required by Operational Instruction S8 ) occur and that any necessary adjustments 
are made to those procedures.  
Fire and Emergency is also a member of the Australasian Fire and Rescue 
Associations Council (AFAC). AFAC's Urban Operations Group has recognised that fire 
services in Australasia wou ld benefit from additional guidance on ship firefighting.  
The development of an AFAC guideline on this topic has been added to its work 
programme.   Fire and Emergency will consider the  guideline once it is available with 
the intent of incorporating relevan t content into Operational Instruction S8.  
It is expected that this procedure will be in place by the first quarter of 2019 and Fire 
and Emergency would welcome input for the Commission when developing the 
procedure.  
8.2.2.  There is a need for shore -based respond ers to be more  familiar with the unique aspects of 
fighting fires on board ships , so that they can provide effective response s regardless of the 
circumstances . 
The FENZ training standards did not cover fully the special considerations for responding to 
shipboard fires . 
On 19 September 2018  the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive Officer  of FENZ  
that he review the FENZ training standards to ensure  that they contain sufficient training in 
the unique aspects of fighting fires on board ships.   (024/18)  
On 4 October 2018 , Fire and Emergency New Zealand replied:  
Fire and Emergency is currently reviewing its training modules for maritime incidents. 
This is part of Fire and Emergency's response to its newly articulated function in 
 
Final Report MO -2017 -205 
<< Page 23 >>
 relation to maritime incidents, which is set out in section 12 of the Fire and 
Emergency New Zealand Act 2017 (FENZ Act).  
This includes the revision of an associated reference guide, which will be amended 
to better reflect the various fire extinguishment options and any existi ng emergency 
plan for a vessel.  
We anticipate this work will be completed by the end of August 2019, with 
publication in September 2019 after final consultation and review.  
Notwithstanding the above, all Fire and Emergency Officers are trained in incident 
command systems, dynamic risk assessments of incidents and undergo regular 
simulation training for incident management. These skills are applicable and utilised 
at a wide range of incident types.  
8.3. Recommendations to Lloyd ’s Register International ( New Zeala nd) 
8.3.1.  The fire on board  the Kokopo Chief  was caused by radiated heat from an incandescent 
reflector  lamp fitted in a cargo light igniting the timber cargo.  
While it is widely known that incandescent reflector  lamps produce heat, the findings of this 
investig ation offer valuable information to ship designers, owners and operators to consider 
when selecting the means of lighting in cargo holds  and other parts of their ships.  There are 
equivalent lighting options , such as LED lamps,  that do not produce the same high 
temperatures . 
On 19 September 2018  the Commission recommended , through Lloyd ’s Register 
International , that the International Association of Classification Societies alert members to 
the potential risk posed by lights that emit high heat, such as ones fitted with incandescent 
reflector lamps , for them to consider when approving designs or auditing safe ship 
management systems on board ships.  (025/18)  
On 20 September 2018, Lloyds Register International (New Zealand) replied  in part:  
LRI agrees with the investigator’s conclusion that this incident should be 
communicated to IACS for consideration; therefore our formal request for work on 
this matter was submitted to the IACS Machinery Panel.  
8.4. Recommendation to the International  Group of P&I Clubs 
8.4.1.  The fire on board  the Kokopo Chief  was caused by radiated heat from an incandescent 
reflector  lamp fitted in a cargo light igniting the timber cargo.  
While it is widely known that incandescent reflector  lamps produce heat, the findings of this 
investigation  offer valuable information to ship designers, owners and operators to consider 
when selecting the means of lighting in cargo holds and other parts of the ir ships.  There are 
equivalent lighting option s, such as LED lamps,  that do not produce the same high 
temperatures . 
On 19 September 2018  the Commission recommended that the Executive Officer of the 
International Group of P&I Clubs  disseminate the lessons learned from this accident to all  of 
its members and advise them of the potential risk to ship safety posed by lights that radiate 
high levels of heat.   (026/18)  
On 4 October 2018 , International Group of P&I Clubs replied:  
[International Group of P&I Clubs] confirm that [we] will notify th e relevant Group 
committees of the Final recommendation 026/18 and p rovide them with a copy of 
this so that this can be brought to the attention of the club's loss prevention 
departments and in turn their shipowner memberships if this has not already been 
done.

 Final Report MO -2017 -205 9. Key l essons  
9.1. Safety procedures such as switching off cargo hold lights should be documented and include 
system s for checking that they have been carried out . 
9.2. Some lamp types  generate a substantial amount of heat that can be a fire hazard.  Ship 
owners and operators should consider using other types of lamp  that do not generate high 
heat in locations where the risk of fire is present . 
9.3. The required firefight ing systems on board ships are unique to the special design and 
construction of ship s.  When possible , they should be fully utilised in accordance with the 
operati ng instructions .
