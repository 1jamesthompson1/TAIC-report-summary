- name: Inadequate Safety Management Systems
  explanation: The operator's safety management system failed to fully mitigate the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, despite a previous incident under similar circumstances. This indicates a systemic issue in identifying and addressing potential fire hazards. "The operator's safety management system had not fully mitigated the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, in spite of an earlier incident involving similar circumstances" (4.2). Furthermore, the operator had not included the risk of fire caused by hot cargo lamps in its fleet safety management system, which demonstrates a lack of comprehensive risk assessment and management within the organization (4.2.11).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  explanation: The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties, which could lead to confusion and inefficiency during emergency situations. "The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties" (4.3). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of clear and well-understood emergency response plans, which are crucial for effective incident management (4.3.1-4.3.16).
- name: Firefighting Techniques and Training
  explanation: The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires, which suggests a gap in the preparedness of shore-based firefighting personnel when dealing with maritime incidents. "The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires" (4.4). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for specialized training and knowledge for effectively combating fires on ships, which have unique firefighting challenges compared to land-based structures (4.4.1-4.4.7).
- name: Risk of Incandescent Lighting
  explanation: The use of high-powered incandescent reflector lamps in ships' cargo holds was identified as a significant fire hazard. The accident investigation confirmed that the cargo lamp produced sufficient heat to ignite the timber cargo, leading to the fire. "The burn pattern on the timber cargo adjacent to the cargo hold light was a strong indication that the heat generated by the reflector lamp was the cause of the fire" (4.2.1). This theme is relevant as it points to the need for safer lighting alternatives in ship design and operation to prevent similar incidents (4.2.7).
- name: Procedural Compliance and Documentation
  explanation: The absence of written procedures or checklists for ensuring cargo hold lights were switched off before loading flammable cargo or when loading was complete indicates a lack of procedural compliance and documentation. "The ship had no written procedure or checklist for ensuring the cargo hold lights were switched off before flammable cargo was loaded against cargo light recesses, or when loading was complete and hatch lids were closed" (5.2). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of having clear, documented procedures to prevent human error and ensure safety measures are consistently applied (4.2.9).
- name: Coordination Among Responding Agencies
  explanation: The need for a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies, was evident. "However, it is important that there be a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies" (4.3.12). This theme is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of coordination and communication among different agencies during emergency responses to ensure an effective and unified approach (4.3.9, 4.3.13).
