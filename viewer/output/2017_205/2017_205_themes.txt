Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate risk mitigation: The operator's safety management system did not fully mitigate the risk of fire caused by cargo hold lighting, despite a previous incident with similar circumstances. The use of high-powered incandescent reflector lamps in ships' cargo holds is commonplace, but alternative lighting options that do not produce high temperatures, such as LED lamps, should be considered. Procedures should be in place to ensure that cargo hold lighting systems are turned off or isolated at an appropriate time to prevent fire hazards.

2. Lack of clear responsibilities: The responsibilities of the various authorities involved in responding to the fire were not clearly documented and understood by all parties. There should be a clearly defined and understood position of responsibility for the emergency response, including a way to resolve any procedural conflicts between the responding agencies.

3. Inadequate training: The FENZ training standards did not fully cover the special considerations for responding to shipboard fires. There should be more information and training for FENZ crews on fighting fires on board ships in port or near coastal situations to achieve a more common approach when ship and shore-based crews are jointly involved in firefighting operations.
