The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault 
or blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommenda tions to improve transport safety.  The cost of 
implementing any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is 
a matter for the regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and  
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation organisations overseas .  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence s with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purp ose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency  
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 20 June 2010, a Boeing 737 -800 aeroplane operated by Pacific Blue was being flown on a 
conventional instrument approach to Queenstown Aerodrome.  When making an instrument 
approach, pilots must see the runway before they may descend be low the minimum descent 
altitude and they must maintain visual reference with the runway until landing.  If visual 
reference is lost, they must execute a missed approach procedure.  
1.2. Because of the mountainous terrain, the minimum descent altitude for the conventional 
instrument approach to Queenstown is about 3500 feet above the aerodrome.  The terrain 
prevents pilots descending straight ahead from the minimum altitude and landing.  I nstead, 
they must  circle while descending until their aircraft is in a position to land.  
1.3. When the Pacific Blue aeroplane arrived at the minimum descent altitude, the pilots could see 
lower cloud in the Queenstown basin , but the runway was clear .  However, because low cloud 
patches would have obstructed their manoeuvring to the final approach for runway 23, t he 
pilots reported to air traffic control  (ATC)  that they would attempt to land on the reciprocal 
runway  05. 
1.4. Meanwhile the controller had cleared anothe r Boeing 737 -800 aeroplane operated by Qantas  
to begin an approach behind Pacific Blue.  The Qantas  pilots were flying a 'required navigation 
performance' approach based on global navigation satellite system technology, which  allowed 
them to descend to  a much lower minimum altitude .  At the time, Pacific Blue had not applied 
to the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA) for authorisation to use that technology .  The con troller 
cleared Qantas  for its  approach based on an expectation that the Pacific Blue  pilots , hav ing 
commenced circling , would land or, if unable to land, would remain in the aerodrome visual 
circuit.  
1.5. Lower cloud was likely to have prevented the Pacific Blue pilots maintain ing visual contact 
with runway 05, so they discontinued the circling  and climbe d directly to intercept the 
prescribed missed approach track for the instrument procedure they had flown .  The y had not 
planned to enter or remain in  the visual circuit as the  controller had expected  and, because of 
their position when they commenced the climb, probably could not have done so because of 
their proximity to  terrain.  
1.6. The controller then instructed Qantas  to conduct the missed approach for its procedure and at 
the maximum rate of climb, in order to maintain separation from the Pacific Blue aero plane .  
The Queenstown ATC tower has no radar  facility , because the surrounding mountains are 
incompatible with that.  
1.7. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) did not investigate further 
whether  the minimum  required 1000  ft vertical separation between the 2 aeroplanes was 
breached, b ecause  it was clear that the potential for such a breach  was high  and that alone 
was a safety issue that needed addressing.  
1.8. The Commission 's key findings  addressed the following issues : 
 the weather conditions were not suitable for Pacific Blue to descend below the minimum 
descent altitude  
 the air traffic controller  had not ensured that the required minimum separation  would be 
maintained between the 2 aeroplanes  
 the Pacific Blue pilots and  the air traffic controller had different understandings of what 
would occur in the event Pacific Blue did not land after  circling  
 the various publications used by pilots and controllers that described instrument approach 
procedures and circling procedures  were not consistent, which was a hazard likely to lead 
to misunderstandings between pilots and air traffic controllers  
 the circling manoeuvring that is required after a non -precision approach at Queenstown is 
a deman ding procedure that ought to be reviewe d for suitability

 Report 10 -007 
 a wider  review of the Queenstown air traffic management system and operational  
procedures would be prudent, given the special features associated with operations at  the 
aerodrome and the increas ing number of commercial jet aeroplane oper ations . 
1.9. The Commission made recommendation s to the Director of Civil Aviation  (the Director)  that he : 
 ensure that th e current development of a strategic plan for air traffic management  and the 
risk assessment  of Queenstown flight operations address  the safety issues identified i n 
this report  
 eliminate the use of similar titles for different instrument approach procedures to the same 
runway  
 require the procedural and compliance aspects of non-precision approaches at 
Queenstown to be re-evaluated  
 ensure that  common operational material published by different organisations be 
accurate ly reproduced from the source documents  
 require a system to be installed to provide controllers with real -time observation s of the 
weather conditions behind Deer Park Hill . 
1.10.  The Commission identified the following key lessons  in this inquiry:  
 a pilot m ust not  descend below the applicable instrument approach minimum descent 
altitude unless  certain that the conditions are suitable for a landing  
 pilots must understand the operational  assumptions in the design of instrument approach 
procedures, and how those assumptions determine the limits of safe manoeuvring  
 organisations that re -publish mutually important operational information from authoritative  
source s must ensure that the inform ation is accurately reproduced  so that all users  
interpret the information  correctly and apply it consistently.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 21 June 2010, the CAA notified the Commission of this incident.  An inquiry was opened  
that day.  
2.2. The investigator  in charge interviewed the Pacific Blue pilots and senior operational managers 
of the airline at its Christchurch head office  in June 2010 , and a further meeting was held with 
Pacific Blue management in August 2010.  
2.3. The involved ATC staff were interviewed at Queenstown Aerodrome  in June 2010 .  Relevant 
ATC data was reviewed at Queenstown and at the Airways Corporation of New Zealand 
(Airways) national centre at Christchurch . 
2.4. Recorded flight data was obtained from both airlines and analysed with the assistance of th e 
Australian Transport Safety Bureau .  The details of the Qantas  pilots were not obtained 
because their aeroplane was incidentally involved.  
2.5. Three meetings were held with representatives of the CAA and Airways  during the inquiry, and 
a preliminary dra ft was reviewed by an independent air traffic safety specialist.  
2.6. On 14 December 2011 , the Commission approved the circulation of a draft final report to 
interested persons for their comment.   Submissions were received from the captain and first 
officer of the Pacific Blue aeroplane, Pacific Blue Airlines (the name of which was changed to 
Virgin Australia Airlines (NZ) Limited in 2011 ), Airways and the CAA.  The ir submissions were 
considered in preparing the final report.  
2.7. The Queenstown Airport Corporation r eviewed the draft final report and did not make a 
submission.  
2.8. On 13 March 2012 the Commission approved the publication of the report.

 Report 10 -007 3. Factual  information  
3.1. Instrument  approach procedures - general descrip tion 
3.1.1.  An instrument approach is a series of predetermined manoeuvres for the orderly transfer of an 
aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) from the beginning of the initial approach 
to landing.  The procedure design provides specified clearance from terrain and obstacles.  
3.1.2.  There are 2 main types of instrument approach procedure - non-precision and precision.  A 
non-precision approach provides lateral  course guidance only and the pilot controls the height 
of the aircraft to be at or above certain altitudes at certain points along the co urse.  Non -
precision approaches may involve aircraft having to manoeuvre or circle after reaching the 
minimum descent altitude in order to align with the runway.  This requires the pilot to have 
visual reference with the runway and the surrounding terrain.  
3.1.3.  A precision approach allows the pilot to fly a more exact approach path, because vertical 
guidance is given as well.  This brings the aircraft lower and closer to the runway before 
reaching the minimum altitude.  At the end of a precision approach the air craft will be aligned 
with the runway for a 'straight -in' landing.  
3.1.4.  The instrument approach procedures are depicted on 'approach charts' that show the 
prescribed altitudes and track s to be flown, as well as obstacles and some terrain.  In 
addition, they sho w the missed approach procedure to be flown if the aircraft does not land.  
3.1.5.  An aircraft's vertical position is normally referenced to altitude.  The approach minimum 
descent altitude is the lowest altitude to which  a pilot may descend before acquiring the 
required visual reference to make a safe landing.  If the required visual reference is not 
achieved by the missed approach point, or cannot be maintained after that point, the missed 
approach procedure must be flown  (see Figure 1) . 
3.1.6.  For a particular type of approach procedure, the minimum descent height above an 
aerodrome varies according to the height and proximity of the terrain and obstacles 
surrounding the aerodrome.  For example, a n approach to an aerodrome located on an 
extensiv e Tibetan plateau will have a higher minimum descent altitude , because Tibet is well 
above sea level, but could have a much lower minimum descent height than a similar type of 
approach to an aerodrome like Queenstown , which  is closer to sea level but close ly 
surrounded by high mountains (see Figure 2). 
3.1.7.  Circling to land is considered more difficult and is statistically less safe than a straight -in 
landing.  This is because the aircraft will normally be at a low height above the aerodrome and 
must remain with in a specified distance from the runway in order to be assured of obstacle 
clearance while maintaining the minimum descent altitude .  The procedure assumes that the 
pilot will maintain visual contact with the runway while circling.  If visual contact is lo st, the 
pilot must immediately carry out the published missed approach procedure, but is assured of 
terrain clearance by being within the circling area and above the minimum descent altitude .

 Report 10 -007 3.2. History of the flights  
3.2.1.  On 20 June 2010, a Boeing 737 -800 aeroplane, registered ZK -PBF and operated by Pacific 
Blue, was used on a scheduled service from Auckland to Queenstown.  On board were 6 crew 
members and 82 passengers.  The flight was conducted under IFR and the captain was the 
pilot flying, as required by the operator's procedures  for Queenstown flights . 
3.2.2.  The air traffic controller was under training and being supervised by an instructor .  The  
controller cleared the flight  to conduct the VOR/DME (very -high-frequency omni -
range/distance measuring equipment) 'ALFA' instrument approach procedure, circling for 
runway 23 (see Figu res 3 and 4 ).2  The reported meteorological conditions at Queenstown 
included  cloud patches at 100 0 ft, the  cloud base at 5000 ft and visibility of 40 k ilometres , 
above the airline's require ment  of 10 kilometres.3  The p ilots considered that the conditions 
were 'a bit marginal' and had discussed the p ublished procedure in case they could not land 
and had to carry out a ' missed approach '.  However, the controller had earlier indicated twice 
that they would become visual and should be able to la nd. 
3.2.3.  The pilots made  visual contact with the terrain when  about 500 f t above the procedure 
minimum descent altitude  of 4700 ft , which was  approximately 3500 ft above the aerodrome  
elevation .  The captain said that they saw the hill  tops in the Lake Hayes basin, the Frankton 
Arm of Lake Wakatipu  and the airport , and that there was l ow cloud close to the threshold  
(approach end ) of runway 23.  
3.2.4.  The flight  continued to descend to  the minimum descent altitude  then orbited at th at  altitude  
while the pilots reassessed the extent of the cloud in relation to their approach to runway 23 . 
3.2.5.  At the same time, another Boeing 737 -800, registered VH -VXU and operated by Qantas , was 
inbound to Queenstown from Sydney with 6 crew members and 156 passenger s on board.  
This flight was also operating under IFR and its pilots had estimated they would land about 5 
minutes after Pacific Blue.  Qantas  had been cleared previously to descend to 12000 ft on the 
'RNP [required navigation performance ] ZULU approach  runway 23 ', but this was amended to 
the 'RNP ZULU approach  runway 05 ' (see Figure 5).4  QANTAS  estimated that the aeroplane  
would be at position 'Coronet', a few miles northwest of the VOR/DME station, at 1345.5 
3.2.6.  At about this time, 2 radio transmissions were made together, one of which might have been 
Pacific Blue reporting visual contact.  After Pacific Blue had commenc ed manoeuvring below 
the instrument procedure minimum descent altitude , the pilots  saw that the low cloud near 
the threshold to runway 23 was more extensive  than they had previously thought .  The 
controller could not see the aeroplane , which was overhead at that stage , and asked the pilots 
if they were now circling for runway 05 , but was told they were still circling for runway 23.  
3.2.7.  The controller then cleared Qantas  for the 'RNP ZULU approa ch runway 05 ' and to 'descend in 
accordance with the profile'.  Th is meant Qantas  was cleared to descend to the minimum 
altitude  for th at approach , which was 2183 ft or lower, depending on the specific capability of  
that flight . 
3.2.8.  Twenty seconds later, Pacific Blue advised it would now track overhead the aerodrome and 
'try' an approach to runway 05 .  It did not request a revised clearance to the diffe rent runway , 
as it should have done , and ATC did not explicitly re -clear it.  The pilots  then asked ATC about 
the cloud to  the south and over the Frankton Arm, because they found it difficult to discern the 
height of the cloud tops, and were told the cloud was quite thick to the south but the Frankton 
Arm looked clear.  
                                                        
2 The r unway designat ion is the magnetic heading in the take -off direction, rounded to the nearest 10 degrees.  
3 The cloud base is the height above ground of the lowest layer of cloud cover ing more than half the sky.   By convention, 
the units are feet.  
4 The correct approach titles and correct radiotelephony references were ' RNAV [ area navigation ] approach runway … ' 
(International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (2006b), Part III, s.5, para. 1.4.2.5).  RNP referred to Qantas being 
specially approved for  approaches with much lower minima than the VOR/DME approach.  
5 By convention, the units for flight p rocedure distances are nautical mile s.  O ne nautical mile is approximately 1.85 
kilometres .

Figure 3 
Approach flown by Pacific Blue  
(All approach and aerodrome figures are from Aeronautical Information Publication New Zealand)  
3.2.9.  ATC was required to separate IFR flights  in the Queenstown airspace , but as the Queenstown 
facility was not equipped with radar , other vertical  and horizontal  separation procedures were  
applied .  The controller expected Pacific Blue to land off the circling approach  or, if it did not  
land, to join the large aircraft figure -8 visual circuit at 4000 ft (see Figure 6).6  The controller 
then instructed Qantas  to report passing 6000 ft, which she anticipated would occur when 
Qantas  was near Coronet.  Her plan was  that if Pacific Blue had not landed or had joined the 
visual circuit when Qantas  made the report, she would instruct Qantas  to carry out a missed 
approach in order to maintain at least 1000 ft vertical separation . 
3.2.10.  The controller advised Qantas  that it might have to conduct a missed approach because 
Pacific Blue was unable to land on runway 23 and was now circling for runway 05.  The Qantas  
pilots advised that in that event they would divert to Christchurch.  The control ler later

 Report 10 -007 explained that the gap between the estimated times of arrival of the flights had been about 5 
minutes, but had reduced because Pacific Blue had orbited and would now have to back -track 
on the runway after landing, in order to reach the terminal t axiway.  This would have delayed 
the Qantas  landing .

3.2.11.  'Deer Park  Hill' was  a hill immediately  south  of the aerodrome .  After Pacific Blue had flown 
overhead the aerodrome and turned to go behind Deer Park  Hill, the pilots saw  that they 
would  likely lose visual contact with the runway because of low cloud.  At 1345  they advised 
ATC that they had commenced a missed approach  and were track ing to positio n AFTON, the 
missed approach  holding poin t 15 miles from the VOR/DME . 
3.2.12.  The controller acknowledged the report and stated, 'For separation, remain visual if able.'  The 
Pacific Blue pilot said 'We'll do our best. [We are] i ntercepting the 212 radial ' (the published 
missed approach track ).  The controller then  asked the pilot if he could  join the figure -8 circuit , 
but he repeated that  the flight was intercepting the 212 radial and was clear of terrain .  The 
controller immediately instructed the Qantas  flight  to commence a  missed approach  with the 
best rate of climb .  The instructor controller then took over  from the trainee .

3.2.13.  The Pacific Blue pilots  told ATC that they 'could not maintain visual contact in the basin above 
about 5000 or 6000 f eet'.  The captain said later that had ATC instructed them beforehand  to 
fly the figure -8 circuit, they might ha ve been able to comply , but having commenced  the 
missed approach  it wo uld have been difficult  to turn right without getting too close to  terrain .  
However, they intercepted and flew  the missed approach track before they enter ed cloud.  
3.2.14.  Pacific Blue  was not a uthorised  for the same high -precision ap proaches  as Qantas , so its 
pilots did not know all of the positions referred to by ATC and Qantas , and were concerned 
initially that Qantas  might be on an approach  that came over the lake in the opposite direction 
to the missed approach track th ey were flying .7  At one point t he Pacific Blue pilots observed a 
target on their traffic display, a couple of miles behind  and 800 ft or 900 ft above  them .8  The 
collision avoidance systems fitted to  the aeroplanes did not generate a ny traffic advisor ies or 
warning s. 
                                                        
7 This was the similarly named 'RNAV  runway 05 ' approach . 
8 The traffic display was part of the Airborne Collision Avoidance System, equipment that was mandatory for aeroplanes 
of this size.

3.2.15.  Airways reported the incident as a possible loss of separation  because Pacific Blue 'did not 
follow the publ ished missed approach procedure ' and the controllers were not certain that the 
minimum separation of 1000 ft had been maintained.  At the time, Airways had a 
multilateration surveillance system  under trial that showed the positions of the 2 aeroplanes  
and their altitudes.9  The data was unverified, but helped the controllers to manage the 
situation.

 3.2.16.  The Pacific Blue captain said later that he believed he had flown the published  missed 
approach procedure.   The first officer agreed, and queried the wisdom of turn ing back towards 
the aerodrome and VOR/DME , which was the start point of the missed approach procedure,  if 
meteorological conditions were known to be poor . 
3.2.17.  The Commission obtained c opies of the incident reports submitted by the captains to their   
respective airlines.  The Qantas report noted they were on the  'RNAV 05' approach, whereas 
the flight was cleared  for (and flew) the 'RNAV  runway 05 ZULU' approach.   That  error is 
discussed later in the context of similar names  for different approaches . 
3.2.18.  The incident occurred in dayli ght at 1345 . 
3.3. Recorded flight data  
3.3.1.  The Commission reviewed recorded fli ght data f rom both aeroplanes . 10  Figure 7 shows parts 
of the f light paths  of both aeroplanes during the incident.  The path for Pacific Blue is not 
smoothed  because the position data obtained was less accura te than that for Qantas .  The 2 
positions  marked (o and o) are for the same time and were used to synchronise the data .  
The pressure altitude was the only recorded parameter that was corrected (but not 
validated) .11 
3.3.2.  The Pacific Blue pilots initiated the missed approach shortly after the aeroplane had turned 
towards the west behind Deer Park Hill, and when it was at an altitude of approximately 3400 
ft.  The speed did not exceed the procedure maximum of 16 0 knots until the aeroplane was 
established on the published missed approach track.  
3.3.3.  A comparison of the recorded data from the 2 aeroplanes showed that the minimum 
horizontal  separation was about 2.7 miles, with an associated vertical separation of more than 
3800 ft.  This occurred about 30 seconds after Pacific Blue had commenced the missed 
approach and when Qantas  was descending through 7600 ft immediately east of the 
aerodrome.  
3.3.4.  The Qantas  missed approach was comme nced just southeast of the aerodrome and at about 
the time the flight had previously estimated for position 'Coronet', which was nearly 6 miles 
north.  The aeroplane was then passing approximately 7100 ft, with a speed of 185 knots.  A 
comparison with the RNAV runway 05 ZULU approach chart suggest ed that  the aeroplane was 
above the correct approach profile, but the reason for this was not examined.  The vertical 
separation between the aeroplanes then was about 2000 ft, but it decreased because of 
Pacific Bl ue's higher rate of climb at that time.  
3.3.5.  The vertical separation remained between 1600 ft and 1800 ft until Qantas  climbed above 
about 8200 ft , and it then decreased to a minimum of about 1000 ft when the aeroplanes 
were about 4.2 miles apart, but about to head  in opposite directions.  Although one Pacific 
Blue pilot recalled seeing an indicated altitude difference  of about 800 or 900 ft, the 
minimum vertical separation was not calculated more exactly because of the recorder time 
base and position data appro ximations.12 
 
 
                                                        
10 Recorded data was analysed with the help of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau . 
11 Recorded pressure altitudes were  corrected by deducting 2 16 ft to give the altitude indicated to the pilots.  
12 The relative height of the other aeroplane was shown o n the Airborne Collision Avoidance System display.

3.3.6.  Pacific Blue was climbing through about 6300 ft when the aeroplane intercepted the 
prescribed missed approach track  approximately 7 miles from the VOR/DME, which was the 
start point for the missed approach procedure .  The procedure design minimum a ltitude at 7 
miles was 5528 ft.13 
3.4. Personnel information  
3.4.1.  The Pacific Blue c aptain held Australian and New Zealand airline transport pilot licences , with 
a Boeing 737 -800 rating obtained in 2006.  He  had been  hired  by the airline  in January 2009 
as a direct -entry captain  on the Boeing 737 -800.  His medical certificate, renewed  in January 
2010, included a restriction that he wear spectacles when flying, which he said he was doing 
on the incident flight.  As at 20 June 2010 he had a ccrued 18 790 flying hours, inclu ding 
2370 hours on the B737 -800.   His previous line check had been  completed in September 
2009 and his previous instrument rating check had been  completed in December 2009.  The 
captain commuted from Australia  for each rost er period,  but maintained accommodation in 
Auckland , his roster base.   The 4 days prior to 20 June  had been  free of duty , and although he 
had returned to Auckland the night before the incident flight, he had considered himself fit for 
duty. 
3.4.2.  The Pacific Blue first officer held a New Zealand commercial pilot licence (aeroplane) issued in 
June 2000.  He had obtained a B737 -800 type rating in September 2008 and had been  hired 
by the airline  in October 2008.  His medical certificate, renewed  in Januar y 2010, had a 
restriction that he wear spectacles when flying, which he said he was doing on the incident 
flight.  As at 20 June 2010 he had accrued 4500 flying hours, including 1300 hours on the 
B737 -800.  His previous line check had been  completed in May  2010 and his previous 
instrument rating check had been  completed in March 2010.  He had had the 45 hours prior 
to the 20 June flight off duty , and had considered himself well -rested before the incident flight.

 3.4.3.  About 40 of Pacific Blue's 150 pilots were qu alified to operate into Queenstown.  To qualify, a 
captain had to complete a computer -based training package  and a flight simulator session 
and observe, from the flight -deck jump -seat, one or more arrival s into and departure s from 
Queenstown .  Depending on  previous experience, the candidate then had to operate a number 
of training flights into and out of Queenstown before a check flight .  First officers, at the time, 
had to complete the computer -based training package only.   Both of the incident pilots met 
the company's currency requirement for operating the flight.  
3.4.4.  The simulator training was intended to place 'emphasis on the IFR arrival and departure 
procedures' and 'to provide familiarisation with the transition to [visual meteorological 
conditions] fligh t and manoeuvring considerations from the minima to touchdown.'14 The 
captain said his training  had covered the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) 
Procedures for air navigation services -aircraft operations ( PANS -OPS) procedure for loss of 
visual reference below the minimum descent altitude , and the figure -8 circuit procedure.15  
The s imulated cloud base s were at or above the minimum descent altitude , with no low cloud 
to obscure ground features.  
3.4.5.  The Pacific Blue captai n had completed the ground training in November 2009 and the route 
training requirements in February 2010.  He had flown into the aerodrome more than 15 
times  since  and had completed a Queenstown line check and simulator revision in July 2010.  
3.4.6.  The first officer on the incident flight had not 'crewed up' for any simulator training set at 
Queenstown.  He had met the company's Queenstown qualifi cation in September 2009  and 
had operated into Queenstown 4 times  since . 
3.4.7.  The other jet operators into Queenst own required first officers to complete a simulator training 
package before being cleared to operate as crew  into the aerodrome . 
3.4.8.  Although its previous training programme had been  approved by the CAA, following this 
incident Pacific Blue amended the aerodrome qualification requirement to include simulator 
training for first officers, and recurrent simulator training for both ranks.   The CAA later made 
simulator training a mandatory part of the aerodrome qualification for pilots of large aircraft 
perfo rming  air transport operations into Queenstown . 
3.4.9.  All air traffic controllers in New Zealand are trained and employed by Airways.  The ATC 
instructor had been  issued with a New Zealand air traffic controller licence on 2 February 
2009 and held aerodrome and approach controller ratings, and an air traffic service instructor  
rating  issued in April 2010.   All of his ATC experience had been  gained at Queenstown 
Aerodrome.  His previous annual proficiency assessment had been  completed on 15 July 
2009 , and he compl eted the next assessment on 12 July 2010.  He held a current medical 
certificate with a requirement to wear spectacles, which he said he was doing at the time of 
the incident.   While instructing, an instructor was fully responsible for th e position  being 
trained . 
3.4.10.  The ATC trainee had had no aviation experience prior to commencing training in 2009.  She 
had been  issued with an air traffic trainee licence on 9 September 2009 and had been at the 
Queenstown Aerodrome since January 2010 for on-the-job training  as a tower and approach 
controller .  The i nstructor considered she had completed approximately 60 -70% of the 
required objectives and experience  by 20 June 2010 and was progress ing well .  The trainee  
held a current medical certificate with no restrict ions.  
3.4.11.  In addition to the trainee controller and the instructor, another controller was in the tower 
acting as the Co -ordinator.  The Co-ordinator had been  issued with a New Zealand air traffic 
controller li cence on 22 September 2009 and held the appropriat e aerodrome and approach 
controller ratings.  All of his controlling experience had been  at Queenstown Aerodrome.  His 
previous annual proficiency assessment had been  completed on 19 March 2010.  He held a 
current medical certificate with no restrictions.

 Report 10 -007 3.4.12.  The instructor and trainee had started their duty at 1000 that day and returned from a br eak 
approximately 2 5 minutes before  the incident .  The coordinator had started duty at 1145.   The 
instructor  said the traffic was light  and he did not know of any issues affecting the controllers ' 
fitness  for duty.  
3.4.13.  As the Qantas  flight was incidentally involved , the flight crew detail s were not requested . 
3.5. Aerodrome information  
3.5.1.  Queenstown Aerodrome is located between the Frankton Arm of Lake Wa katipu and the 
Arrowtown Basin, at an elevation of 1171 ft, and surrounded by mountainous terrain rising to 
more than 7600 ft in the Remarkable s Range, less than 8 k ilometres  from the aerodrome .  
There are 2 runways, but only the  sealed runway 05/23 is suitable for large aeroplanes.   
Runway lighting was not installed  at the time of this incident , but was installed  in 2011.  
3.5.2.  Between 2000 and 2010 the number of international aircraft movements at Queenstown 
increased by 524%, bringing a 666% increase in pas sengers .  Domestic aircraft movements 
increased by 17% and domestic passengers by 77%.16  International passenger growth 
increased by 50% in the year to June 2011.17  The great majority of movements were by 
scheduled airlines, but corporate and charter aircr aft average d one movement a day.  
3.5.3.  The Aeronautical Information Publication New Zealand (AIP) state d (AIP, p.NZQN AD 2 -13), 
'Flight procedures for Queenstown are detailed on the … Arrival/Departure chart', but in fact 
none is given on that chart (AIP, p.NZQN  AD 2 -31.1).18  The AIP Aerodrome pages state d the 
circuit directions,  which i nclud ed a right -hand circuit for runway 23 , but also included  a 
different circuit procedure for aircraft with mass greater than 5700 kilograms  (see Figure 6). 
3.5.4.  The different circui t for large r aircraft  arose from airline concern s that a jet aeroplane going 
around from its final a pproach to the  main runway 05/23 could conflict with a n aircraft on the 
downwind leg of t he circuit for the crossing grass runway.  The internal 'Request for Change' 
submitted by the aerodrome chief controller noted th ere was a right -hand circuit for runway 23 
promulgated under Civil Aviation Rule s19, but added 'terrain prohibits large aircraft carrying 
out [the published] circuits, so the airlines have adopted a figure -8 type circuit pattern.'  
3.5.5.  The propos al was  supported by an aerodrome users ' group meeting at which 3 major airlines 
were represented, and the request was approved by the Airways' Air Traffic Services Policy and 
Standards Group  in 2004 .20 
3.5.6.  The AIP chart depict ed the figure -8 circuit  in relation to prominent terrain features  and state d 
the altitude to be flown.  There was no speed or other requirement  specified , so t he ceiling 
and visibility minima for visual flight rules ( VFR) in the vicinity of an aerodrome in a control 
zone were assumed to apply .21  The circuit, although described on the chart current then a s 
left-hand, result ed in right -hand base turns to runway 05 and runway 23, and an initial left 
turn off runway 23 .  These  turns were contrary to the directions published for light aircraft.  
Notwithstanding the likely presence of ATC during large aircraft operations at Queenstown, the 
Commission has previously commented on the safety issue of  opposed circuits.22 
3.5.7.  The CAA was n ot identified as an interested party when the procedure was proposed, even 
though the connection with Civil Aviation Rule s Part 93 was noted by Airways in the original 
request for change.  Part 93 require d the Director's approval for the establishment or 
withdrawal of a right -hand circuit , and the procedure required both types of change .  Airways 
and CAA staff commented during this investigation that the figure -8 circuit was seen as a

operations until 2007.

 tactical intervention available to controllers at any time and therefore  its use did not require 
the specific approval of the Director.  
3.5.8.  At th e time of the incident,  the AIP chart showing the figure -8 circuit had a sub -heading 
'Procedure if aircraft is maintaining visual reference and unable to land (go -around)'.  Most 
pilots c onsider a 'go around' to be a discontinued landing attempt from the final approach, 
and distinguish that from a 'missed approach' which c an be started from any point in an 
instrument approach or circling approach.  The chart was placed in the visual approa ch 
procedures of the AIP , and was not referred to in  the instrument approach procedures .  This 
meant that  a pilot of an IFR flight  would not necessarily know  that ATC expected the figure -8 
circuit to be followed in the event of a missed approach while circling.  The Jeppesen flight 
procedures guide , used by Pacific Blue and Qantas  and likely used by the majority of operators 
of itinerant jet a eroplane  flights  into Queenstown, placed the figure -8 procedure with VFR 
arrival procedures in its chart binder .23  A pilot conducting a crew briefing prior to an 
instrument approach would not normally review the VFR procedures  for that aerodrome . 
3.5.9.  In response to observations made during this investigation, the chief controller initiated an AIP 
change to correct the description of the figure -8 circuit and clarify its purpose.  On 10 February 
2011, the chart sub -title was amended to read, 'Procedure if aircraft is maintaining vi sual 
reference or circling from an instrument approach and unable to land.'  The supporting 
documentation for the change request noted that, if the change w ere not implemented, there 
was 'a high risk of misinterpretation by pilots unfamiliar with the proce dure'.  The request also 
stated that 'no one has been asked to consult on this [change]', and the potential for the 
procedure to be misinterpreted had not been identified earlier due to the procedure's 'very 
rare use.'  
3.5.10.  The ATC instructor said that all operators had, at one time or another, flown the figure -8 
pattern.  A CAA publication intended mainly for VFR pilots note d, 'Airline traffic may fly a non -
standard circuit.  They normally make a large figure -eight approach. ' (CAA, 2008, p.20).  
3.5.11.  Pacific Blue had categorised Queenstown Aerodrome as a category 'X' aerodrome, the only 
such aerodrome in its route network at that time.  Before flying into a category X aerodrome, a 
captain had to have completed the approved airport training program me discussed above.  
Other airlines operating into Queenstown had a similar categorisation and required special 
training  for their pilots . 
3.5.12.  The Pacific Blue operations manual  stated 'Pacific Blue aircraft may circle visually in the event 
of a missed approach/go -around within the [Queenstown] aerodrome traffic circuit, by day 
only.'24  However, that manual elsewhere  described the Queenstown visual circuit as 'a visual 
go-around procedure [applied] to provide separation from light aircraft circuit traffic .'25  The 
incident pilots knew of the procedure  and the captain had flown it in a flight simulator, but 
they understood it to be a VFR procedure.  They said they had briefed  to fly the published 
missed approach procedure for the VOR/DME approach if they did not land after circling  and 
did not know that ATC expected them to remain in the visual circuit  in that event . 
3.5.13.  The Pacific Blue operations manual contained a further reference to  the figure -8 circuit:26 
In the event of an engine failure after take -off, manoeuvre via the figure eight 
special procedure circuit .' 
3.5.14.  On 2 July 2010 Pacific Blue issued a Flight Crew Operational  Notice that clarif ied the present 
ATC use of the figure -8 circ uit for protecting the missed approach.27 
3.5.15.  Fleet management representatives of most of the other Part 121 operators using Queenstown 
Aerodrome at the t ime of the incident advised informal ly that they considered the figure -8 
circuit as a go -around procedure o nce in the circuit, although one operator refer red to an 
unspecified 'non -standard procedure for missed approaches into the circuit' as an arrival

 Report 10 -007 'threat' to be briefed by its pilots prior to approach.   Qantas  and Jetstar did not permit their 
aeroplanes to fly the figure -8 pattern at any time .  The majority were uncomfortable with 
manoeuvring at relatively low level in mountainous terrain, especially as a missed approach 
was most likely to arise because meteorologi cal conditions  were unsuitable for a landing . 
3.6. Meteorological information  
3.6.1.  MetService advised that o n 20 June 2010 a low pressure system was moving east over the 
South Island with an associated front moving south.28  The automatic weather station at 
Queenstow n Aerodrome reported light rain and drizzle in the 2 hours preceding the incident, 
with cloud detected between 4000 and 5000 ft above the aerodrome.  At and after 1400, 
lower patches of cloud and a rapidly lowering cloud base were detected.  
3.6.2.  On those days that it operated services to Queenstown, Pacific Blue flight operations 
management receive d 3 updates of forecast and actual (current) weather, with attached 
screen -shots (when conditions permi tted) from a webcam that showed  Deer Park  Hill. 
3.6.3.  At 1315, while under the control of a different ATC position, one of the Pacific Blue pilots had 
called Queenstown Tower  to check the weather conditions  before commencing the approach .  
They informed Queenstown ATC that they had received the earlier broadcast weather 
information 'Foxtrot'.  The controller said , 'conditions are pretty much as mentioned in Foxtrot' 
and 'there is low cloud about 1000 f eet right throughout the basin and to the south of Deer 
Park.'29 
3.6.4.  A few minutes  later the broadcast information was changed to 'Golf' , one change being 
increased cloud at 1000 ft above ground.  Having been told by ATC that conditions were still 
like those broadcast in information 'Foxtrot', the Pacific Blue pilots did not listen for 'Golf' prior 
to the control of their flight being transferred to Queenstown Tower .  The information was as 
follows:  
Information Golf at time 1318: expect a VOR/DME approach A, runway 23, 
runway wet, surface wind 210 degrees magnetic at 3 kt, visibility 40 kilometres 
in drizzle, cloud: few at 200 ft, sca ttered at 1 000 ft, broken at 5000 ft, overcast 
7000 ft, temperature 7oC, dew -point 6oC, [altimeter setting] 1005 hectoPascal, 
forecast 2000 ft wind 190 degrees at 10 kt. ATC training in progress.  
3.6.5.  At 1347, shortly after the incident, the broadcast informati on was amended again, to report 
generally lower cloud layers and to add a reference to cloud in the final approach area for 
runway 23.   The controller said later  that the cloud patches had been fluctuating.  
3.6.6.  The Pacific Blue captain provided a sketch of the  cloud conditions he had seen  in the 
Queenstown basin.  Although the lower slopes of the major ranges were visible, l ow cloud 
obscured much of the eastern half of the basin , and to the south of the aerodrome  only 
Frankton Arm and the summit of Deer P ark Hill were visible.  The captain later estimated that 
the top of the low cloud had been  1500 ft above ground.  
3.6.7.  The visibility from the c ontrol  tower a t Queenstown is restricted through an arc of 
approximately 35  degrees  to the south , because the summit of Deer Pa rk Hill is only 2 
kilometres away  and more than 15 00 ft above the aerodrome.  The operator of Queenstown 
Aerodrome and Airways advised that previ ous attempts to find  a viable method for remotely 
observing conditions behind Deer Park Hill had not been successful.

3.7.1.  The VOR/DME approach at Queenstown is a non -precision approach that was inaugurated i n 
1994  and is available for general use by suitably rated pilots and equipped aircraft.   The high 
terrain and mountain weather dict ate unusually high approach minima.  Similarly high cloud

the time period of ATC information requested by the Commission.  
 
Report 10 -007

 base and visibility requirements exist for IFR departure procedures, with pilots required to fly a 
visual segment until reaching the minimum altitude to ensure terrain clearance.  
3.7.2.  The high minimum de scent heigh t and location of the VOR/DME do  not permit a straight -in 
landing off the approach.  Th erefore , an unusual amount of visual manoeuvring (circling)  is 
required before landing .  A number of pilots who had flown  the procedure in the first few years 
after its approval suggested that circling in earlier models of the Boeing 737 and in other 
types was managed so that the runway was always kept in sight, particularly  when circling 
south of Deer Park  Hill for runway 0 5.30  The Commission asked the CAA if there were any 
conditions or assumptions associated with the initial approval of the approach, and which 
might have addressed circling requirements, but no relevant  documentation was found.  
3.7.3.  The continued refinement of aircraft navigation systems led ICAO to develop the concept of 
performance -based navigation, which uses aircraft equipment and airspace characteristics to 
define the required navigation performance  for enroute and terminal proce dures .  RNAV 
approach procedures with much lower Required Navigation Performance minima  have been 
progressively introduced at Queenstown Aerodrome since 200 5.  An operator provides  special 
training to its pilots and requires a CAA authorisation before it c an conduct Required 
Navigation Performance approaches, but the procedures  provide the following benefits:  
 greater ATC and aircraft operational efficiency  
 much lower  minimum approach heights  
 fewer  missed approach es 
 departures under meteorological conditions  similar to the approach minima  
 greater accuracy of procedur e tracking.  
3.7.4.  The Commission obtained copies of the incident reports submitted by the captains to their 
respective airlines.  The Qantas  captain had written that they were on the 'RNAV 05' approach,  
whereas the flight was cleared (and flew) the 'RNAV ZULU approach  runway 05 '.  The similar -
sounding approaches have completely  different tracks , but their titles meet the  ICAO charting 
procedures (ICAO, 2006b, Part 1, s.4, para 9.5.3) . 
Instrument approach  procedures  
3.7.5.  The operating rules for, and design of,  instrument approach procedures are found in the 2 
volumes of ICAO PANS -OPS.  These approach procedure s assure d terrain and o bstacle 
clearance only if the aircraft were  flown in accordance with the relevan t design and operating 
assumptions . The  only subjects in the CAA syllabus of ground training for a pilot licence 
instrument rating that were directly  relevant to understanding these assumptions were the 
following ( CAA, 2010, p.21):  
 [Pilots must be able to ] state when descent below decision altitude or 
minimum descent altitude may be made on an instrument approach.  
 [Pilots must be able to ] describe  the missed approach procedures and 
limitations . 
3.7.6.  The source of information for both topics was given as the AIP , which r epeat ed the 
requirements of Civil Aviation Rule 91.41 3(c) for descent below the minimum descent 
altitude .  The Rule state d, in part:  
91.413 Take -off and landing under IFR  
(c) Operation below … minimum descent altitude . Where a … minimum descent 
altitude  is applicable, a pilot -in-command must not operate an aircraft at any 
aerodrome below the minimum descent altitude  … unless —  
(1) the aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on 
the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal 
manoeuvres that allows touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the 
runway of intended landi ng; and  
                                                        
30 The pilots referred to were not , and had not been , employees of Pacific Blue.   
 

<< Page 18 >>
 Report 10 -007 (2) the flight visibility is not less than the visibility published in the applicable AIP 
for the instrument approach procedure being used; and  
(3) … at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is 
distinctly visible an d identifiable to the pilot —  
(i) the approach lighting system; or  
(ii) the threshold markings; or  
(iii) the threshold lights; or  
(iv) the runway -end identification lights; or  
(v) the visual approach slope indicator; or  
(vi) the touchdown zone or touc hdown zone markings; or  
(vii) the touchdown zone lights; or  
(viii) the runway or runway markings; or  
(ix) the runway lights.  
(d) Landing.  A pilot -in-command must not land an aircraft when the flight 
visibility is less than the visibility published in t he applicable AIP for the 
instrument approach procedure used.  
3.7.7.  The Pacific Blue standard operating procedures included a restatement of rule 91.413(c).  As 
Queenstown Aerodrome at the time of the incident was not equipped with any lighting apart 
from the pr ecision approach path indicator (a  form of  visual approach slope ind icator), the 
runway or threshold itself had to be distinctly visible and identifiable  while operating below the 
minimum descent altitude . 
Missed approach  
3.7.8.  A specific missed approach procedure is designed f or, and is a part of, e ach instrument 
approach procedure .  The missed approach is flown when the approach is  discontinued and 
provides a track and climb profile that ensures obstacle clearance until  the aircraft reach es a 
safe altitu de. 
3.7.9.  Obstacle clearance is ensured t hroughout the procedure,  as long as the design assumptions 
are met.  One of th ose assumptions is that the missed approach will be initiated at , or before, 
the missed approach point, (e.g. the VOR/DME), and at an altitude not lower than the 
minimum descent altitude .  Turns and/or speed limitations may also be prescribed.  PANS -
OPS state d, 'It is expected that the pilot will fly the missed approach procedure as published' 
(ICAO, 2006a,  6.1.4).  
3.7.10.  Civil Aviation Rule 91.413(e) addresse d missed approach procedures and conditions , stat ing: 
91.413 Take -off and landing under IFR  
(e) Missed approach procedures . A pilot -in-command must immediately execute the 
missed approach procedure published in the applicable AIP if —  
(1) the  requirements of paragraph (c) [given in paragraph 3. 7.6 above ] are not 
met at either of the following times:  
(i) when the aircraft is being operated below minimum descent altitude ; 
or  
(ii) upon arrival at the missed approach point … and any time  after t hat 
until touchdown; or  
(2) an identifiable part of the aerodrome is not distinctly visible to the pilot during 
a circling manoeuvre at or above minimum descent altitude , unless the inability 
to see an identifiable part of the aerodrome results only from n ormal 
manoeuvring of the aircraft during approach . 
3.7.11.  The AIP reference to missed approach procedures stated  (AIP, p.ENR 1.5 -30): 
The published missed approach procedure must be executed [emphasis in AIP]:  
(a) if, at the missed approach point … the pi lot has not established visual reference 
with any portion of the runway or visual landing aids … : or 
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 19 >>
 (b) an identifiable part of the aerodrome is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a 
circling manoeuvre at or above minimum descent altitude ; or 
(c) at any time during th e final approach when directed by ATC.  
3.7.12.  The AIP reference differ s from Rule 91.413 by omitting Rule condition ( e)(1)(i)  and most of 
condition (e)(1)(ii) , which relate to a  loss of visual reference when operating below the 
minimum descent altitude , and also omits the exception in (e)(2) for loss of visual reference 
caused solely b y normal manoeuvring (e.g. banking a high-wing aeroplane)  when at or above 
the minimum de scent altitude . 
3.7.13.  The Pacific Blue operations manual  added  a further option , stating, 'The publ ished missed 
approach procedure [for the approach being flown] or, if applicable, a visual missed approach  
must be initiated under the following circumstances …' 31 [emphasis added], but elsewhere 
the manual noted that at Queenstown 'all missed approach procedures track over [the 
VOR/DME]'.32 
Visual manoeuvring  (circling)  
3.7.14.  Circling describes the phase of flight after an instrument approach has been completed, 
during which the aircraft i s manoeuvred to align  with the landing runway.  Circling is a visual 
flight manoeuvre, but an aircraft operating under IFR remains an IFR flight  while circling .  Each 
circling situation is different because of the many  variables , such as runway layout , terrain and 
weather conditions.   However, circling  typically entails  manoeuvring  the aircraft  from the 
missed approach point to a point in the normal aerodrome circuit pattern  that intercepts a 
visual descent profile to the landing runway, at which point the aircraft can be descend ed from 
the minimum descent altitude . 
3.7.15.  The circling area is defined by connecting tangents to arcs centred on the runway ends at the 
aerodrome  (see Figure  8).  The radius of the arcs is related to the aircraft category and speed, 
wind speed and a nomi nal 20 degrees bank angle for the turn.  In the case of  a Boeing 737 -
800, th e radius i s 4.2 miles.  Circling may be prohibited in a sector if terrain dictates, as the 
Remarkables Range does at Queenstown.  The highest  terrain or obstacle within the circling 
area is used to determine the minimum height for circling , which must be maintained until the 
aircraft intercepts the visual descent profile . 
3.7.16.  PANS -OPS state d, 'After initial visual contact, the basic assumption is that the run way 
environment should be kept in sight while at minimum descent altitude/height (minimum 
descent altitude/H) for circling.  The runway environment includes features such as the 
runway threshold or approach lighting aids or other markings identifiable with  the runway' 
(ICAO, 2006a, 7.2.2).  
3.7.17.  The circling approach at Queenstown was not typical, because the minimum descent height, 
being 3500 ft above the aerodrome, and the close terrain required 'extensive manoeuvring'.33  
This meant that a pilot had to descend from the minimum descent altitude well before joining 
a normal aerodrome circuit pattern (or abnormal circuit, in the case of runway 05) to avoid an 
excessive rate of descent before intercepting a visual descent profile.  The typical flight paths, 
descendi ng in an orbit or passing behind Deer Park  Hill, usually involved a turn away from the 
runway and the pilot losing sight of the runway.  
3.7.18.  The instructor controller said that after a pilot had reported 'visual' on the VOR/DME approach 
at Queenstown, the contr oller would issue circuit joining instructions, such as 'join right base 
runway 23'.  He said it was assumed that a pilot who reported 'visual' could manoeuvre 
visually and would land.  The report of 'visual', meaning a pilot could see the ground, was not 
a request for a visual approach, for which a specific request was required.

Figure 8 
Circuling area construction, and example  
(Figure taken from PANS -OPS (ICAO, 2006a, p.I -4-7-6)) 
3.7.19.  The circling minimum descent altitude  ensured obstacle clearance  only when operating within 
the circling area from  which the minimum descent altitude  was determined .  When operating 
below the minimum descent altitude , the circling area was irrelevant, because obstacle 
clearance then depended o n the pilot having visual reference .  Therefore, PANS -OPS and the 
national rules state d, in part (ICAO, 2006a , 7.3.3):  
Descent below minimum descent altitude /H should not be made until:  
 visual reference has been established and can be maintained;  
 the pilot  has the landing threshold in sight; and  
 the required obstacle clearance can be maintained and the aircraft is in 
a position to carry out a landing.  
3.7.20.  The Pacific Blue operations manual listed the weather requirements for circling at 
Queenstown, but not the preferred thrust/ speed or configuration when manoeuvring visually 
in the basin.  
3.7.21.  The Manual of Air Traffic Services  (Airways , p.RAC 3 -46, 8 April 2010) , and similar AIP text, 
state d: 
A pilot on a circling approach may be instructed to join the aerodrome cir cuit when:  
 MET conditions are equal to or better than circling minima; and 
[emphasis in original]  

 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 21 >>
 
 The pilot has reported visual or is seen by the aerodrome contro ller to 
have established visual  reference.  
Missed approach  commenced from circling  
3.7.22.  The Pacific  Blue  standard operating procedures repeated the PANS -OPS mandatory 
requirement to execute a missed approach if visual reference wi th the intended landing 
runway were  lost while  operating  below the minimum descent altitude  or beyond the missed 
approach poi nt.34  The typical circling tracks at Queenstown Aerodrome d id not allow p ilots to 
keep the runway in sight at all times . 
3.7.23.  In the event of a missed approach commenced when the aircraft was below the minimum 
descent altitude , the pilot w ould have to maintain visual contact with terrain until able to  join 
the published missed approach track and meet the altitude criteria.  If that c ould not  be done, 
the pilot would have to  attempt to stay within the circling area while climb ing back to the 
minimum descent altitude .  
3.7.24.  The PANS -OPS procedure for a missed approach commenced from circling  state d, in part  
(ICAO, 2006a, 7.4.1) : 
If visual reference is lost while circling  to land from an instrument approach, the 
missed approach specified for that particular approach  shall be followed.  The 
transition from the visual (circling) manoeuvre to the missed  approach should be 
initiated by a climbing turn , within the  circling area, towards the landing runway , to 
return to the circling altitude [ minimum descent altitude ] or higher , immediately 
followed by interception and execution of the missed approach procedure.  
3.7.25.  Pacific Blue's  pilot training manual35 and the Jeppesen guide repeated the PANS -OPS 
procedure, as did t he Manual of Air Traffic Services , adding  (Airways , p.RAC 3 -48, 8 April 
2010):   
No other missed approach procedure other than that applicable to instrument 
training aircraft is permitted . 
3.7.26.  However, the Manual of Air Traffic Services also included the following note (Airways, p.RAC 3 -
48, 18 November 2010):  
Unless inst ructions are issued to the contrary, an aircraft on an instrument approach 
and instructed to 'GO AROUND' should carry out the published missed approach 
procedure, whilst an aircraft operating VFR or an IFR aircraft on a visual approach 
should continue in t he circuit.  The latter should be confirmed by a positive circuit 
clearance/instruction.  
3.7.27.  The AIP repeated the Manual of Air Traffic Services ' statement  that a pilot who initiated a go -
around while making a visual approach had to  remain in the circuit (AIP,  p.AD 1.5).  
3.7.28.  PANS -OPS noted that the actual manoeuvre required to establish on the missed approach 
course would depend on where the aircraft was when visual reference was lost.   The instructor 
controller said h e expect ed that a pilot carrying out a  missed a pproach would r emain in visual 
conditions  in the figure -8 visual circuit  until ATC  could issue other instructions . 
3.7.29.  The Pacific Blue captain said later that he had been  trained to stay within the circling area 
when c ommenc ing a missed approach from below the minimum descent altitude .  Therefore 
he stayed within 4 miles of the runway end  and climbed quickly to intercept the missed 
approach track , all the time  maintaining visual contact with the terrain.  
Protection  of the missed approach  
3.7.30.  The AIP state d that 'ATC will at all times protect the missed approach' , add ing (AIP, p.ENR 1.5 -
33, section 4.20, 12 Feb 09) : 
Where actual meteorological conditions are at or above the published circling minima 
for the aircraft category and type of approach ATC may protect th e missed approach by

 Report 10 -007 requiring an arriving aircraft to circle visually within the aerodrome traffic circuit … 
provided circling is permitted for the aircraft category and type of approach, with the 
following exceptions:  ... 
(b)  for Category C aircraft the  MET conditions must be equal to or better than a 
ceiling of 2000 ft and visibility of 8 [kilometres] or the circling m inima for the aircraft 
approach category and type of ap proach, whichever is the higher  … 
This procedure will not be used by ATC when:  
 [meteorological] conditions (e.g. turbulence, crosswind) are such 
that there is doubt an aircraft may be able to circle visually; or  
 the pilot may be unfamiliar with the aerodrome; or  
 when a pilot advises both Approach Control and Tower, each on 
first cont act, that they do not wish to carry out such a procedure.  
Aircraft unable or no longer able to carry out this procedure must advise Approach Control 
or Tower immediately.  
3.7.31.   The Manual of Air Traffic Services  expresse d the provision and its conditions differ ently  
(Airways, p.RAC 5 -42, 10 April 2008):  
When conditions are at or above the published circling minima for an arriving 
aircraft's approach category and type of approach, the missed approach may be 
protected by instructing  the pilot to circle visually wi thin the aerodrome traffic circuit 
… … [emphasis added].  
and note d: 
The pilot may decline circling at any stage during the approach if it is considered unsafe.  In this 
circumstance, separation must be established by the quickest means practicable and essential traffic 
information given if applicable.  Confirmation of ability to circle should be established earlier rather 
than later . 
A controller  shall not use this procedure when : 
 [meteorological] conditions such as fluctuating cloud base, severe  
turbulence  or strong cross  wind s are reported to an aircraft or broadcast 
… ; or 
 It is known or suspected that the pilot is unfamiliar with the aerodrome; 
or 
 The pilot advises approach or aerodrome control at any time that they 
are unable to carry out thi s procedure.  
3.7.32.  The conditions on 20 June 2010 were better than the published circling minima for Pacific 
Blue and none of the exceptions to ATC use of this procedure applied.  However, the Pacific 
Blue pilots did not advise ATC that they would not use th is procedure, and the controller did 
not instruct the m to use it.  As a consequence of this investigation, Airways revised the Manual 
of Air Traffic Services and AIP to clarify the weather criteria and other restrictions applicable to 
the use of the procedure.   A new restriction was that an aircraft shall not be instructed to enter 
the aerodrome traffic circuit when 'there is any cloud in the circuit area that could cause the 
pilot to lose sight of an identifiable part of the aerodrome.'  
3.7.33.  The instructor confirme d that , to protect the missed approach,  controllers at Queenstown had 
relied on a pilot who report ed 'visual' being able to enter  or remain in the figure -8 circuit.  
However, usually no specific instruction was given to pilots to do so, and none was given in 
this case.  
3.7.34.  There was a clear belief among Part 121 operators that ATC at all times protected the 
published missed approach for the instrument approach procedure  of all flights , irrespective 
of other ATC action to separate traffic.  T hey understood that the correct action when  going 
around from a circling manoeuvre was to stay within the circling area  while climb ing to the 
minimum descent altitude  and to then establish on the published missed approach track.  
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 23 >>
 ATC amendment  or termination of missed approach  procedure  
3.7.35.  ATC could  issue alternative missed approach instructions  to pilots of aircraft involved in 
instrument training  only, and in sufficient time for the pilot(s) to brief the revised procedure  
(AIP, p.ENR 1.5 -32). 
3.7.36.  The Manual of Air Traffic Services  state d (Airways, p.RAC 3 -48, 8 April 2010):  
The missed approach is a critical stage of flight and pilots should be given time to 
establish on the missed approach procedure, as published, before any instructions 
are issued by ATC . 
3.7.37.  After a missed approach ha d been initiated, A TC was not permitted to  instruct the pilot to fly a 
procedure  other than that published unless the aircraft was under radar control or had 
reached the minimum missed approach holding altitude ( Airways , p.RAC 3 -49, 18 November 
2010 ).  There was no ATC radar facility at Queenstown , and t he minimum missed approach 
holding altitude for the VOR/DME procedure flo wn by Pacific Blue was 8500 ft.  
ATC separation  of arriving aircraft  
3.7.38.  The Queenstown control area and control zone were  classified category D airspace in which 
ATC had to  apply separation between IFR flights.   As there was no radar capability in the 
vicinity of Queenstown, vertical separation of 1000 ft or horizontal separation criteria were 
applied.  Visual separation sta ndards, including composite visual -geographical separation, 
were not practical for jet aircraft in the Queenstown basin.  Composite visual separation 
requires  the controller to have an aircraft continuously in sight, so if the sun, weather or 
terrain might  interfere with the controller's ability to sight the aircraft concerned, composite 
visual separation is not to be used (Airways, p.RAC 5 -5, 25 November 2004).    
3.7.39.  The Manual of Air Traffic Services  rules for providing separation between arriving aircraft 
included the following (Airways, p.RAC 5 -40, 4 June 2009):  
A second aircraft shall not be cleared for an instrument approach until the preceding 
aircraft:  
Is in communication with and sighted by the aerodrome controller and reasonable 
assurance exists that a normal landing can be accomplished, provided the vertical spacing 
between aircraft shall never be less than the applicable vertical separation minima until 
visual separation can be applied ; or 
Is on a visual approach and reasonable  assurance exists that a normal la nding can be 
accomplished , provided the vertical  spacing between the aircraft shall never be less than 
the applicable vertical separation minima  … until visual separation can be applied; or …  
If on completion of an instrument approach the first aircraft is required to execute a visual 
circling manoeuvre to the runway -in-use, care must be taken to ensure that there is no 
likelihood of confliction by a following aircraft on instrument approach.  [emphasis  in 
original].  
3.7.40.  The instructor said later that  a following a ircraft  would n ot be cleared for its approac h until the 
preceding aircraft was  manoeuvring  visually . 
3.8. Organisational and management information  
3.8.1.  Pacific Blue is a New Zealand -registered airline based at Christchurch, and a partner of Virgin 
Australia.  The airline commenced operations in 2004 between New Zealand and Australia 
and some Pacific island destinations.  Domestic services between New Zealand main centres 
started in 2007, with Queenstown services added from September 2009.  
3.8.2.  Pacific Blue holds an air operator certificate issued by the CAA and its aeroplanes are on the 
New Zealand aircraft register.  The Chief Executive, Manager Aircraft Operations and many of 
the senior operational manage rs and pilots are former employees of N ew Zealand airlines and 
have  personal experience of Queenstown operations.  
 

<< Page 24 >>
 Report 10 -007 3.8.3.  The airline 's risk register referred to the complexity of operations at Queenstown and made 
numerous references to the need to stabilise its pilot experience levels in order to miti gate 
some of the related hazards, such as collision with terrain, weather assessment and flights in 
adverse weather.  A frequently identified 'treatment' for th ose risks was the introduction of 
Required Navigation Performance  procedures, w hich the airline had hoped to achieve  by 
winter 2011.  
3.9. Other occurrences  
3.9.1.  Two other occurrences illustrated the difficulty in assessing weather conditions behind Deer 
Park Hill.  On 22 June 201 0, a Pacific Blue B oeing 737 was reported  to have flown at low level 
soon after taking off from Queenstown Aerodrome runway 23 and while following the Bowen 3 
departure procedure.36  Information received at the time suggested the flight encountered  low 
cloud shortly after take -off, but  then the aeroplane climb ed rapidl y from a position behind 
Deer Park .37 
3.9.2.  On 13 July 2011, a Pacific Blue flight departing Queenstown Aerodrome on the Bowen 3 
procedure encountered rapidly reducing flight visibility soon after take -off.  The pilots decided 
that th e safest course of action was  to continue the climb following the  procedure .38 
3.10.  Other information  
3.10.1.  During this inquiry, the Commission heard that the CAA had a number of its departments 
conducting risk assessments relevant to Queenstown operations, and that Airways was in the 
process of completing a Queenstown Tower Five Year Strategic Plan 2011 -2016.  The CAA 
advised that its risk assessments, which ha d different completion dates, include d, but were 
not limited to, the following areas:  
 the safety investigation of recent occurrences (incl uding the subject of this inquiry)  
 the installation of runway lighting and a likely proposal for night operations  
 a safety review of conventional flight operations (e.g., VOR/DME approaches)  
 a review of the minima for Required Navigation Performance operat ions.  
3.10.2.  Airways provided a copy of its report on the ir 5-year strategic plan, which stated the aim was to 
'identify the procedures, processes, technology and resources required for Airways to safely 
manage the projected growth of Queenstown Aerodrome between  2011 and 2016'.39  The 
report covered, among many topics, the rapid growth in jet traffic; the proposed and 
anticipated infrastructure changes by the airport operator; and the inadequacy of the current 
route structure, equipment an d staff to handle that gr owth .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. The mountainous terrain and weather associated with Queenstown Aerodrome make aircraft 
operations there challenging and potentially more hazardous than at most other airports in 
New Zealand.  The establishment of the VOR/DME and related instrument approaches in 
1994 improved access, although the high approach minima meant that jet  aeroplanes  were 
not guaranteed to complete every  approach.  
4.2. Recent advances in RNAV systems mean  that true 'all weather' operations are now available 
for flight s approved to use that technology.    Those airlines using approved RNAV procedures 
are tending not to revert to conventional approaches if the required navigation performance is 
not available, but even though th e majority of scheduled services  will soon be authorised for 
RNAV approaches , non-precision approaches will continue  to be used for some time.  
4.3. The Commission did not investigate further whether the minimum required 1000  ft vertical 
separation between the 2 aeroplanes had been  breached, because it was clear that the 
potential for such a breach was high and that alone was a safety issue that needed 
addressing.  
4.4. In addition, a mismatch  between  the understanding of  pilots and ATC in regard to their 
respective operational practices  was identified .  The investigation also identified some safety 
issues that had been suspected or recognised  by the industry prior to this incident , but not 
adequately defined or resolved . 
4.5. The key feature of this incident was that the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane had a 
different understanding from  the controller of what they would do in the event of commenc ing 
a missed approach  from  a circling manoeuvre .  The different understanding resulted from a 
mismatch between the various document ed procedures  available to pilots and controller s.  
The incident also identified other  safety issues that are discussed in the following order : 
 the suitability of the meteorological conditions  for the Pa cific Blue flight  
 the awareness of meteorological conditions behind Deer Park  Hill 
 whether Queenstown circling approach es compl y with PANS -OPS 
 pilot understanding of the design of instrument approach procedures  
 the separation of arriving  IFR aircraft  
 the validity  of the figure -8 circuit  and its suitability for jet aircraft  
 the protection of the missed approach  
 the naming of RNAV approaches  
 the safety of operations at Queenstown Aerodrome . 
The suitability of the meteorological conditions  
4.6. The cloud base and visibility  reported in the automated aerodrome information 'Foxtrot' and 
'Golf' were better than the approach minima of 4700 ft and 10 kilometres for Pacific Blue's 
Boeing 737 aeroplanes .  Therefore the pilots were justified in commenc ing the VOR/DME 
approach .  The pilots had not listened to ' Golf' , but the controller had twice indicated that they 
should be able to land and had also said that conditions might be better south of Deer Park 
Hill.  It was not until  they had enter ed an orbit  at the minimum descent altitude , having been 
cleared for a circling approach,  that they saw th at th e actual conditions  were worse than they 
had expected . 
4.7. Because of the unusual ly high minimum descent altitude and the need to circle in 
mountainous terrain and possibly demanding weather, a pilot's decision to descend for a 
landing can be more difficult to make at Queenstown tha n at other aerodromes .  Looking 
down from 3500 ft above the aerodrome, the Pacific Blue pilots had a clear view of the cloud 
around the aerodrome  and behind Deer Park  Hill, but had difficulty determining the height of 
the cloud tops  there .  However, what they saw , together with the earlier advice from ATC that 
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Report 10 -007 there was  cloud at 1000 ft above the ground throughout the basin, s hould have led them to 
conclude  that conditions were marginal for a landing.  The pilots were better placed t han the 
controller t o assess the conditions, because the controller  could not see behind D eer Pa rk Hill; 
yet a short time later , while circling f or runway 05, they asked the controller  about the cloud to 
the south and in the Frankton Arm.  This late request  and their earlier comment about 'trying ' 
for runway 05 suggested that th e pilots had not assessed  correctly the conditions  while 
overhead, but that after descending below the approach minimum descent altitude  of 4700 ft , 
they did recognise that the conditions were marginal .  The inquiry found that the requirements 
to be met for  descen t below an approach minimum descent altitude were not understood 
correctly by all operators and pilots . 
4.8. When lower cloud ahead of the aeroplane ma de it unlikely that they would  be able to  maintain 
visual reference with t he runway , the Pacific Blue pilots, as required by Civil Aviation Rule 
91.413(e),  execute d a missed approach . 
4.9. Published i nstrument approach minima are stated in terms of cloud base and flight visibility 
only, and do not consider  lesser amounts of cloud below the minimum descent altitude .  A 
pilot conducting an instrument approach must decide whether conditions are suitab le for a  
landing , in accordance with company procedures .  At aerodromes where a circling a pproach  
can be flown at the minimum descent altitude , lower cloud patches might not bother a pilot 
who joins the circuit pattern and can remain at the minimum descent altitude  until 
intercept ing the visual descent profile to the runway.  Should visual reference with the runway 
or terrain be lost, the aircraft is already safe at the minimum descent altitude  and the pilot 
need s only to climb to join and fly the published missed approach . 
4.10.  In contrast , the unusually  high minimum descent height  at Queenstown means a pilot must 
start losing some of that height as  soon as the decision is made to land, in order to intercept 
an acceptable final approach path to the runway.  The mountainous terrain dictates a circling 
flight path that, for the most part, bears no resemblance to a normal aerodrome circuit 
pattern , but that does al ign with part of the figure -8 visual circuit .  While the aeroplane is 
below the minimum descent altitude , low er cloud c an restrict visual reference and the safety 
of the manoeuvre.  If visual reference with the runway or ground is lost, a missed approach is 
required and that will be  started from below the minimum descent altitude .  At aerodromes 
like Queenstown where terrain is such a dominant factor, airline operational procedures 
should  give guidance on the acceptability of  cloud  below the minimum descent  altitude .  The 
Pacific Blue operations manuals did not address this issue.  
Finding : 
 
The reported meteorological conditions were acceptable for the Pacific Blue flight to 
commence the instrument approach, but, because of low cloud  behind Deer Park Hill , 
were not suitable  for the flight to have descended below the instrument approach 
minimum altitude.  
 
Awareness  of meteorological conditions behind Deer Park  Hill 
4.11.  The visual circling manoeuvre to runway 05 and the visual segment s of instrument departure 
procedures from runway 23  are almost wholly to the south of Deer Park  Hill, out of sight of 
controllers in the aerodrome tower .  When weather conditions are fluctuating or marginal, 
controllers rely on pilot reports o f cloud behind De er Park Hill.  The problem is that under such 
conditions, fewer VFR flights operat e, which reduce s the frequency of such reports.  
4.12.  The inability of Queenstown ATC and flight crews preparing to depart the aerodrome to 
observe directly the meteorological conditions behind Deer Park Hill deprives them of 
essential information.  Th is can be critical f or IFR departures , as they include visual segment s 
during which pilots  are required to maintain visual contact  with terrain until reaching the st art 
of the relevant instrument segment s.  For arrivals and departures, if unsuitable conditions are 
unexpectedly encountered behind Deer Park  Hill, the imperative of terrain clearance might 
require a pilot to deviate from the pu blished procedure, contrary to the  controller's  
expectation.  
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 27 >>
 4.13.  The conditions behind Deer Park  Hill are largely  irrelevant to operators who a re autho rised to 
conduct Required Navigation Performance  approaches , as they c an remain in  instrument 
meteorological conditions as late as align ment with the runway.  Although the majority of 
scheduled jet aeroplane services are soon likely to be approved for Required Navigation 
Performance  procedures, the continued use of non -precision approaches and departures that 
incorporat e visual segments su ggest s that the lack of a r eliable system  for remotely observ ing 
conditions behind Deer Park  Hill, for example, a camera system,  is a safety issue.   A 
recommendation was made to the Director that he require  Airways and the operator of 
Queenstown Aerodrome to address  that safety issue .  
Finding:  
 
The inability of air traffic controllers and pilots of aircraft taking off to observe the 
meteorological conditions behind Deer Park Hill, an area in which pilots must be able to 
maintain visual contact with terrain, is a safety issue that needs to be resolved.  
 
Whether Queenstown circling approaches comply with PANS -OPS 
4.14.  The PANS -OPS circling procedure  assumes that an aircraft will transition from the instrument 
approach to join the aerodrome circuit pattern , remaining at or above the minimum descent 
altitude  and that its  pilot will keep the runway environment in sight .  The minimum descent 
altitude  must be maintained until the aircraft is in a position  to descend to the runway at a 
normal rate of descent and using normal manoeuvres . 
4.15.  Once a pilot descends below the minimum descent altitude , Rule 91.413(c) must be complied 
with at all times .  Th is require s identifiable features of the runway to be kept in sight and the 
aeroplane to be continuously in a position f rom which only a normal rate of descent using 
normal manoeuvres is required until landing .  This is not a requirement that only need  to be 
satisfied at the point when the decision is made to desc end below the minimum descent 
altitude . 
4.16.  Most of the manoeuvring  after making a non -precision approach to Queenstown Aerodrome is 
conducted below the minimum descent altitude  because of the unus ual amount of height to 
be lost  before the aircraft is in a position for a steady descent to align with the runway.  The 
extensive circling is not a normal manoeuvre as envisaged by PANS -OPS, and it  can involve 
orbits, aerodrome flyovers and positioning behind terrain, during which the r unway or 
threshold cannot be kept in sight continuously .  Therefore , particularly for pilots of jet 
aeroplanes , compliance with  the PANS -OPS and Civil Aviation Rule 91.413(c) require ments 
throughout the circling manoeuvre is not always possible . 
4.17.  The practi cal considerations when descending fro m a high  minimum descent height  in difficult 
terrain are a cknowledged , but the accepted practice at Queenstown conflict s with the Rules  
because under normal circumstances an identifiable feature of the runway cannot be kept in 
sight continuously while operating below the minimum descent altitude .  The differences 
between procedure and practice beg the question  as to whether  a transition f rom a non -
precision approach to a landing at Queenstown Aerodrome is a true 'circling ' approach . 
4.18.  The question applies to all aircraft, but the implication for jet aeroplanes is of  more concern 
because they operate at higher speeds and are less manoeuvrable  than smaller aircraft .  
Whether the initial approval of the VOR/DME approach had some associated assumptions or 
conditions, as some experienced  jet pilots believed, could not be determined , because the 
records of the project that established the approach could not be found in CAA archives . 
4.19.  The difficulty in ensuring literal compliance with some of these PANS -OPS procedures at 
Queenstown was acknowledged by some senior staff of the CAA, Airways and airline s.  Tacit 
acceptance of non -compliant procedures creates an unsafe precedent and can lead to false or 
inconsistent assumptions being made by participants  about the correct procedure .  It would 
be better to acknowledge any special requirements  for aircraft  operating  into Queens town and 
to design the procedures accordingly.  Therefore, the Commission is recommending that the 
Director require non -precision approaches at Queenstown to be re -evaluated to determine 
 

<< Page 28 >>
 Report 10 -007 whether any rule exemptions or procedural requirements are necessary to enable safe circling 
manoeuvres . 
Finding:  
 
Pilots , particularly those  of jet a eroplanes,  making non -precision approaches to 
Queenstown Aerodrome cannot fully  meet the PANS -OPS requirements for such 
approaches because the runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when circling below 
the minimum descent altitude . 
 
Pilot u nderstanding of the design of instrument approach procedures  
4.20.  The incident suggested  that the Pacific Blue pilots might have misunderstood some aspects of 
the design of instrument approach procedures e.g. that there is no assured obstacle  
clearance  when operating below the minimum descent altitude , even  though  the aircraft might 
remain with in the horizontal limits of the  circling area ; and th at obstacle clearance on the 
missed approach is predicated on the procedure  being initiated from not below the minimum 
descent altitude and no later than  the missed app roach point  (in this case the VOR/DME .  
However, it was likely that the procedures were not as well understood by pilots generally as 
they should  have  been. 
4.21.  The captain said he believed he took the safest course available to him at th e time and place  
that he abandoned  the landing.  The action was effectively an 'escape' manoeuvre , which was 
achieved safely only because the  pilots  were able to keep the terrain in sight until they 
intercepted the missed approach track , and the  aeroplane  had ample climb performance .  If 
the aeroplane had entered cloud, even while following the PANS -OPS procedure  of turning 
towards the aerodrome and the VOR/DME while climbing to the minimum descent altitude, 
the manoeuvre would have been hazardous.  The captain said that making a right turn to join 
the visual circuit would have been difficult, and Deer Park Hill w ould also have been an 
intervening obstacle.   The pilots commented  that they had kept within the circling radius of the 
runway end while climbing directly to intercept the missed approach track , but the circling 
area offered no assurance of terrain clearan ce while  operating below the minimum descent 
altitude.  
4.22.  The aeroplane was passing 6300 ft and about 7 miles from the missed approach point (the 
VOR/DME ) when it joined the prescribed missed approach track.  The design minimum 
altitude at 7 miles was 5 528 ft; therefore  by then the aeroplane was above the missed 
approach profile . 
4.23.  Circling approaches into Queenstown Aerodrome appear to deviate routinely from the Civil 
Aviation Rule 91.413(e) requirements for a mandatory missed approach .  One e xample is 
losing s ight of the runway  when operating below the minimum descent altitude , which 
inevitably happens when flying a descending orbit to position for either runway, and which can 
also occur when over -flying the aerodrome or passing behind Deer Park Hill for runway 05.  
Although the Rule allows a  pilot to lose sight of an identifiable part of the aerodrome owing  to 
normal manoeuvring of the aircraft e.g. when banked into a turn , that exception applies only 
when the aircraft is at or above the minimum desce nt altitude . 
4.24.  The non -compliance had probably become routine because of the impracticality of achieving a 
landing at Queenstown if one were to observe  the Rule strictly , and because the AIP 
restatement of the Rule was incomplete and inaccurate , in that it omitted the requirement to 
carry out a missed approach if the pilot los t sight of the runway wh ile operating below the 
minimum descent altitude .  Although the Rule had precedence, it was likely that pilots, 
generally, were more familiar with the text of th e AIP.  
  
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 29 >>
 Findings:  
The Pacific Blue pilots  were forced to fly an escape manoeuvre , but maintain ed visual 
contact with terrain  until they intercepted the prescribed missed approach track a t a point 
where they were above the procedure minimum height.  
The inc omplete and inaccurate AIP reference to Civil Aviation Rule 91.413(e) was likely  a 
factor in the routine non -compliance with the Rule by pilots making non -precision 
approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome.  
  
 
The s eparation of arriving IFR aircraft  
4.25.  The estimated arrival times for the 2 a eroplanes  were originally about 10 minutes apart, but 
the gap ha d reduced to 5 minutes by the time Pacific Blue was cleared for its instrument 
approach .  The gap was reduced  further by Qantas  changing to the RNAV 05 Z ULU approach, 
which reduced the distance to touchdown, and then again by Pacific Blue orbit ing before 
circling for runway 05.  
4.26.  The approach sequence for arriving flights is essentially in order of their estimated arrival 
times, although a controller has som e scope to vary the sequence for overall efficiency.  
With out radar, ATC rel ies on pilots' position reports.  As Qantas  was not using the VOR/DME 
approach aid, the controller had to convert mentally its RNAV position reports and estimates 
into a range and bearing from the VOR/DME in order to relate the Qantas  flight pro gress to 
that of Pacific Blue.  
4.27.  The controller cleared Qantas  for the RNAV runway 05 ZULU ap proach after seeing  Pacific 
Blue above the aero drome and after its pilots had confirmed they were circling for runway 23.  
About 2  minutes after Pacific Blue had advised it was  circling for runway 05 , the controller 
added  a check against a loss of separation by instructing Qantas  to report passing 6000  ft.  
This instruction was based on the controllers' expectation , which they assumed t he Pacific 
Blue  pilots shared , that Pacific Blue  would remain in  the visual circuit  at 40 00 ft if it did not 
land.  
4.28.  Controllers, generally, expected that a flight would  land if its pilot had requested to circle, 
which was a reasonable expectation given their collective experience.  The Queenstown 
controllers certainly did not expect a circling IFR aircraft to follow the published missed 
approach procedure  if it did not l and. 
4.29.  The belated 6000 ft reporting requirement  did not remove the  risk of a loss of separation in 
the unlikely event of a subsequent communications  failure  between ATC and Qantas .  Qantas  
was cleared for the approach 'in accordance with the profile' and therefore , without further 
communication,  could have descend ed through the visual circuit  altitude to the much lower 
decision altitude for its approach.  If Pacific Blue had been  in the figure -8 circuit, the Qantas  
flight would have been joining  an almost identical track .  Composite visual separation could 
not have been applied by the controller under such circumstances , because it was unlikely 
that the Pacific Blue aeroplane could have been kept in sight continuously . 
4.30.  Had Pacific Blue joined the visual cir cuit, the controller expected to preserve vertical 
separation by instruct ing Qantas  to fly its missed approach , but i f there had been a 
communications problem and Qantas  had continued its approach , the controller would not 
have been able to revert to vis ual separation of the aeroplanes .  The local terrain did not offer 
an alternative area  for P acific Blue to hold where the controller could keep it in sight .  A loss of 
separation would have occurred . 
4.31.  Therefore, the approach clearance issued to Qantas  did n ot meet the Manual of Air Traffic 
Services ' requirements for the separation of IFR arrivals.  
4.32.  The Pacific Blue pilots had no t planned to  join the figure -8 circuit  if they did not land .  If, 
instead of flying the direct escape manoeuvre, they h ad turned back  towards the aerodrome 
while  climb ing to the missed approach altitude of 8500 ft , a more hazardous loss of 
 

<< Page 30 >>
 Report 10 -007 separation  might have ensued , because Qantas  had already been cleared to descend through 
the same area.  
4.33.  The earlier arrival of Qantas  in the vici nity of the aerodrome greatly reduced the 'cushion' that 
the controller had anticipated between the 2 flights , and contributed to the separation 
reducing when Pacifi c Blue discontinued its circling  descent for the runway .  However, 
because the Qantas  aerop lane was high on its approach profile, the  separation did not 
become critically close.  
4.34.  The c oncurrent approaches  by aircraft using different approach aids and operating under 
distinct ly different criteria  placed a high mental workload on the controllers, particularly as 
there was t raining in progress and the weather was marginal.  The incident  suggested th at th e 
procedures used and tools available to the  controllers  did not give them certainty that the 
aircraft would be separated at all times until the fir st aeroplane landed . 
4.35.  The Pacific Blue  pilots  executed a rapid climb  and followed  what they believed was essentially 
the procedure they had discussed  before the y commenced the instrument approach .  The 
captain had no choice  but to climb , because the manoeuvre was initiated at a point that , in 
this case, he determined did not allow him to turn back towards the aerodrome.  Their 
aeroplane quickly exceeded the 4000 ft limit of the visual circuit  that the controller had 
assumed they would follow .  However , at no prior time had ATC request ed or instruct ed Pacific 
Blue to enter or remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing . 
Findings:  
The procedure for circling below the minimum descent altitude after an instrument 
approach to Queenstown Aerodro me needs to be clarified to ensure pilots and 
controllers are in no doubt as  to their respective actions to achieve  separation from 
other traffic . 
The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes w as not assured  
because the approach clearance issued to Qantas  did not allow for a potential 
communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that 
Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in  the visual circuit in the event of 
not landing . 
Had the Pacific Blue pilots turn ed back towards the aerodrome while  climb ing to the 
missed approach altitude of 8500 ft, which was possible under PANS -OPS, a more 
hazardous scenario  might have ensued, because Qantas  had already been cleared  to 
descend through the same area.  
 
  The v alidity of the figure -8 circuit and its suitability  for jet aircraft  
4.36.  The figure -8 circuit was introduced  to avoid a recognised potential conflict between light 
aircraft in the aerodrome circuit, particularly the circuit for the crossing runway, and a large 
(jet) aircraft  going around instead of  landing on the main runway.  However, as IFR aircraft are 
necessarily operat ing in visual conditions when circling after an instrument  approach , and the 
Manual of Air Traff ic Services and the AIP said a circling IFR aircraft should enter the 
aerodrome circuit in the event of a go -around, the procedure came to be Airways' default 
means for protect ing the missed approach.  
4.37.  The intended use of  the figure -8 circuit by large aircr aft was apparently not clearly explained to 
airlines, whose  policies and practices, together with  pilot perceptions, show ed that the circuit  
was seen as  a VFR procedure .  That view was supported b y the procedure chart being place d 
in the AIP and in the Jeppesen binder well removed from the  instrument approach procedures.   
There was no reference on any chart that the pilot of a large aircraft should, without prior 
instruction from ATC  (which the Manual of Air Traffic Services required) , enter  or remain in the 
figure -8 pattern in the event of a missed approach  commenced while circling . 
4.38.  The figure -8 procedure introduced circuit directions for large aircraft that were different from  
those  already published (for light aircraft).  Airways and the CAA had the view that the figure -8 
circuit was an allowable ATC tactical intervention and therefore not subject to Civil Aviation 
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 31 >>
 Rule Part 93, but the text of the procedure as publi shed in the AIP, and Airways' expectation of 
using it to protect a missed approach,  showed that it was intended to be a permanent 
procedure.  Therefore, the original proposal in 2004 to introduce right -hand circuits s hould 
have been submitted to the CAA for the Director' s approval . 
4.39.  The large -aircraft circuit procedure assume d that, in the event of a go -around , a pilot could  
descend to 2200 ft initially before c limbing to 4000 ft.  However,  low cloud  could be the 
reason for a go -around when manoeuvring after an instrument approach and also prevent 
compliance with th is procedure .  Such weather conditions would not necessarily prevent VFR 
operati ons in the control zone . 
4.40.  The chief controller described the figure -8 circuit as very rarely used , which s uggests that IFR 
pilots routinely make good decisions about the suitability of conditions for a circling approach 
and landing.  However, as it is a necessary contingency procedure, Airways should ensure that 
the procedure is properly approved, described and clearly com municated to potential users.  
Findings:  
Airways had not clearly explained to operators that it expected large aircraft that did not 
land at Queenstown after circling to enter the visual aerodrome circuit.   
The visual circuit procedure  put in place by Airw ays for large aircraft at Queenstown 
should  have had the  approval of the Director because it was intended as a permanent 
change that introduced or varied right -hand circuit s. 
 
 
The p rotection of the missed approach  
4.41.  There  was a clear  mismatch  between what the Pacific Blue pilots  expected to do and what the 
controllers  expected them to do in the event that Pacific Blue discontinued the circling .  The 
pilots understood  that when they had been  clear ed for an instrument approach  ATC protect ed 
the associated published  missed a pproach .  That understanding  was supported  by the 
statements in  the PANS -OPS, the Manual of Air Traffic Services and the AIP  that in the event of 
a missed approach a pilot should fly the published missed approach procedure .  However, 
whether  that rule alwa ys applied when  circling below the minimum descent altitude was 
unclear.  
4.42.  The means available to  ATC to protect the missed approach  can be  affected by  the instrument 
procedure minimum descent height.  For a low minimum height and a typical circling 
procedure flown at the minimum descent altitude , the meteorological conditions might  not 
permit ATC to instruct the first aircraft to remain in the visual circuit if it did not land.  
Therefore, ATC must continue to protect the published missed approach procedure  of the 
circling aircraft , in effect, until it lands.  
4.43.  Where there is a very high minimum descent height, as at Queenstown, a pilot's decision to 
descend for circling must  be supported  by meteorological conditions that are also suitable for 
the visual circuit.   That would allow ATC to protect the missed approach es of both aircraft by 
instructing the first aircraf t to enter the aerodrome visual circuit , or by having an unambiguous 
published procedure that it will do so .  The figure -8 circuit procedure published at the time of 
this incident did not make that clear, but it was l ater amended (see paragraph 6.2 ).   
4.44.  The need to avoid the difficult ATC situation that could result should the first aircraft then 
make an emergency climb e.g. if its pilot lost visual contact with terrain , underscore d the 
importance of the first pilot correctly appraising the conditions before descending below the 
minimum altitude.     
4.45.  ATC always protect ed the missed approach of the following aircraft,  but if the first aircraft ha d 
reported that it was continuing visually, and conditions allow ed, its missed approach might be 
protected  by requiring it to enter the aerodrome visual circuit .  The Manual of Air Traffic 
Services d iffered from the AIP in de scrib ing the means of implementing th at procedure.  The 
ATC manual require d a controller to 'instruct ' the pilot to enter the circuit  and, although noting  
 

<< Page 32 >>
 Report 10 -007 that an IFR aircraft on a visual approach 'should continue in the circuit', the manual add ed 
that thi s 'should be confirmed by a positive circuit clearance/instruction'.  
4.46.  The Pacific Blue captain doubted that he could have turned right into the figure -8 circuit from 
the point he commenced a missed approach, had ATC given him earlier notice to do so, which 
indicated that the aeroplane was not on an appropriate ground track for runway 05.  That was 
likely due to cloud obscuring the landmarks he normally used to position for that runway . 
4.47.  In spite of the guidance in the Manual of Air Traffic Services , Airways ' controllers ha d taken the 
AIP interpretation as their default position when weather conditions permit ted.  The provision 
works a t most New Zealand aerodromes, including other international airports, but at 
Queenstown the terrain and the nature of the figure -8 circuit demand a more cautious use of 
this procedure .  In any e vent, to ensure separation, controllers should take positive action 
rather than rely on what they have incorrectly assumed will be the  default respons e by pilots.  
4.48.  From their first contact with the Pacific Blue  flight , the controller  described low cloud in the 
Queenstown basin and around the aerodrome .  The low cloud ought to have alerted the 
controllers and the pilots that conditions were probably unsuitable for a jet aeroplane to 
remain in  the visual  circuit .  For that reason, t he controllers could  have protected the missed 
approach for Pacific Blue by another means , such as waiting until Pacific Blue had landed 
before clearing  Qantas  for its approach . 
4.49.  During the incident, the altitude separation  at first reduced because Pacific Blue was climbing 
rapidly while Qantas  was still descending.  Once Qantas  began its missed approach at 
maximum climb rate, the altitude difference steadied at about 2000 ft befor e it slowly 
reduced to a minimum of about 1000 ft.  
4.50.  Airways later amend ed the AIP to clarify the general requirement for an aircraft on a missed 
approach to enter the aerodrome visual circuit.  It also noted that an operator c ould inform 
Airways if its aircraft w ould not carry out that procedure generally, or specifically at 
Queenstown Aerodrome, rather than have individual pilots make that decision  on the day . 
Findings : 
Had t he controllers realised that the low cloud around the ae rodrome made the visual 
circuit unsuitable for a jet aeroplane, they could  have protected the missed approach 
for Pacific Blue by a more positive  means, such as not clearing Qantas  for its approach 
until Pacific Blue had landed.  
The controllers and the pil ots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same 
understanding  of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific 
Blue was circling.  The different text s in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services  at 
that time contributed to that misunderstanding . 
 
The naming of RNAV approach es 
4.51.  The introduction of RNAV approaches at Queenstown has created an information gap for 
operators unfamiliar with them.  These approaches are complex, and th e complexity extends 
to the naming of the waypoints that define the procedure track s.  The names are not 
necessarily related to familiar geographical or  radio -navigation aids used for conventional 
approaches, or t o the visual reporting po ints used by pilots when passing their position to ATC.  
Therefore, radiotelephony reference s to w aypoint s that cannot be visualised  by pilots 
unfamiliar with the associated RNAV procedures will be meaningless to those p ilots. 
4.52.  The Pacific Blue pilots knew little about the RNAV approaches, which led to their concern  for 
the proximity of the Qantas  flight  when they began the missed approach .  That concern was 
not unfounded, because the Qantas  crew, in their internal report on the incident, had 
abbreviated the approach name to 'RNAV 05' approach, which would have been head -on, 
whereas they were cleared (and actually flew) the RNAV runway 05 ZULU approach.  The error 
in the incident report might have been an unintentional abbreviation, but a similar error when 
writing down an actual approach clearance could precede a ser ious incident.  
 
Report 10 -007 
<< Page 33 >>
 4.53.  The similar titles of the 'RNAV runway 05' and 'RNAV ZULU runway 05' approaches met ICAO 
requirements , and the same naming convention  was used for VOR/DME  approaches .  
Although not relevant to this incident, the naming convention could cause  confusion  when 
applied to the titles of different  instrument approaches to a particular runway.  
4.54.  The hazard arises because the runway designation is included in the approach title, whereas 
non-precision circling approaches are not to specific runway s.  Such a hazard  is similar to the 
recognised hazard of similar radiotelephony call -signs  for different flights  or aircraft, which has 
on occasions led to pilots erroneously acting on ATC instructions meant for other aircraft  and 
to controllers taking action bas ed on mistak en aircraft report s.  A recommendation was made 
to the Director to seek to eliminate this use of similar titles for different approaches  to the 
same runway . 
Finding s: 
Pilots who are not approved for or not familiar with RNAV procedures may not 
understand radioed position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints . The communication 
gap that this potentially creates is a safety issue.   
Although not a factor in this incident , the use of similar titles for  different RNAV 
approach procedures  to the sa me runway is a hazard that could result in  an aircraft 
flying the wrong approach . 
 
The s afety of operations at Queenstown Aerodrome  
4.55.  The approach and departure flight paths around Queenstown Aerodrome are surrounded by 
high terrain  that severely limits flight path options .  For this reason, operational procedures 
need to be clearly formulated and described, and thoroughly understood and stringently 
applied  by all participants.   The potential hazards demand strict operational discipl ine to 
reduce the risks to an acceptable level.  
4.56.  The highly accurate Required Navigation Performance  procedures offer significantly improved 
safety , greater flexibility and an increased chance of aircraft landing.  However, t hey are 
independen t of ground -based navigation aids, so the integration of aircraft using Required 
Navigation Performance  procedures with those using conventional  navigation aids in the non-
radar airspace places additional dema nds on contr ollers , and can leave pilots using 
conventional navigation aids 'out of the picture '. 
4.57.  Seemingly unrelated incremental changes  and the condoning of a less-strict adherence to 
procedures can, over time, aggregate to produce unintended adverse effects on system safety 
and performance .  At Queenstown, some operational practices appear to have 'drifted' from 
the original specifications, and taken together these changes may have raised the risk profile 
of operations there.  Examples of these changes are the long -standing acceptance of circling 
approaches that at times cannot be in compliance with the Rules, the lack of guidance on the 
acceptability of approaches when there is cloud below the minimum descent altitude , and the 
evolution of the figure -8 circuit from being a simple go-around procedure to also the expected 
procedure  if an IFR aircraft discontinues a circling manoeuvre.  
4.58.  Another example of system drift leading to uninten ded deviation s from the expected standard 
is the differen t wording for a given rule or topic that can be found when comparing operational 
documentation  such  as: 
 PANS -OPS and other ICAO standards  
 Civil Aviation Rules  
 the AIP  
 airline operations manuals  
 the Manual of Air Traffic Services . 
 

<< Page 34 >>
 Report 10 -007 4.59.  The examples given in this report of differences between Civil Aviation Rules and airline 
manuals , and the Manual of Air Traffic Services and the AIP, have been  raised in the context of 
Queenstown operations, but they affect operations at any aerodrome.  
4.60.  Air traffic controllers and pilots primarily use their own organisations ' manuals, which are 
gover ned by, and in part based on, Civil Aviation Rules.  The Rules adopt many of the 
standards and recommended practices of ICAO.  The AIP is a mix of mandatory and advisory 
information, as are the Jeppesen guides, which source much of their information from P ANS-
OPS and the national AIP s of other countries.  In theory, a pilot or controller should be able to 
perform their duty primarily by reference to their organisation's manuals.  
4.61.  Although it is intended that the manuals of ATC providers and airlines, and the  AIP, will comply 
with relevant source documents of higher authority, such as the Civil Aviation Rules, there are 
inconsistencies between some  manuals, even for text copied  from the same source 
document.  Examples given in this report are the AIP restatement of Civil Aviation Rule 91.413 
and of the Manual of Air Traffic Services ' means for protecting the missed approach.  As this 
incident showed, 'front -line' operators such as pilots and controllers are unlikely to know that 
their respective organisation 's manuals  conflict in regard to some mutually important matter s. 
4.62.  The manuals used by certificated organisations, such as Airways and airlines, are approved by 
the CAA.  However, the  CAA considered that the onus was on document holders  to ensure that 
the information and procedures that they publish ed were accurate.  The CAA did not have a 
process, such as  audits, to ensure that the content of manuals was accurate , nor to c heck 
that common -source  material was reproduced consistently by  all users.  Therefore, the 
Commission  is recommend ing to the Director that he ensure that operational material 
published by document holders and approved by the Director is accurate and consis tent 
across all users and complies with the prescribed relevant standards.  
4.63.  Queenstown Aerodrome has special characteristics that make soundly  based and consistently 
applied procedures essential for safety , so the above evidence of system drift suggests that a 
review of the en tire air traffic management sys tem and operational procedures used  there 
could be timely.   Factors that make such a review necessary include , but are not limited to : 
 the increase in the number of domestic and international jet aeropl ane services  at 
Queenstown  
 the predictable corresponding increase in VFR traffic and adventure aviation activities 
there  
 the increasing use of Required Navigation Performance  arrival and departure procedures  
 the conduct of circling approaches after a VOR /DME approach  
 the absence of a radar facility below 10 000 ft  
 the conduct of ATC training  at Queenstown  
 the recent installa tion of aerodrome lighting and  the likely demand for night operations  
 the access of  VFR traffic and adventure aviation activities to ai rspace, which is limited by 
the surrounding high terrain  and shared by an increasing amount of jet traffic . 
4.64.  The Commission a cknowledg ed the current work being undertaken by the CAA and Airways in 
regard to operations at Queenstown Aerodrome, noting that the 2 projects, between them, 
covered all of the above issues identified by the Commission.  The Commission  recommended 
that the Director of Civil Aviation ensure th at the strategic plan being developed by Airways 
and the risk assessment being conducted by the CAA consider  the safety issues  identified  in 
this inquiry .

 Finding s: 
It is likely that the level of risk with flight operations at Queenstown Aerodrome has 
increased because of change s in the variety  and intensity of operations . 
There is no effective  means of ensur ing that the common operational information and 
procedures published by  certificated organisations for their internal use are accurate  
and consistent .  That deficiency inevitably result s in differences that  lead to 
misunderstandings between operational staff , which can compromise the safety of 
operations.

 Report 10 -007 5. Findings  
5.1. The reported meteorological conditions were acceptable for the Pacific Blue flight to 
commence the instrument approach , but, because of low cloud  behind Deer Park Hill , were 
not suitable  for the flight to have descended below the instrument approach minimum 
altitude . 
5.2. The inability of air traffic controllers and pilots of aircraft taking off to observe the 
meteorological conditions behind Deer Park Hill, an area in which pilots must be able to 
maintain visual contact with terrain , is a safety issue that needs to be resolved . 
5.3. Pilots , particularly those  of jet a eroplanes,  making non -precision approaches to Queenstown 
Aerodrome cannot fully  meet the PAN S-OPS requirements for such approaches because the 
runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when their aircraft are circling below the minimum 
descent altitude.  
5.4. The Pacific Blue pilots  were forced to fly an escape manoeuvre, but maintain ed visual contac t 
with terrain until they intercepted the prescribed missed approach track at a point where they 
were above the procedure minimum height.  
5.5. The incomplete and inaccurate AIP reference to Civil Aviation Rule 91.413(e) was likely  a 
factor in the routine non -compliance with the Rule by pilots making non -precision approaches 
to Queenstown Aerodrome.  
5.6. The procedure for circling below the minimum descent altitude after an instrument approach 
to Queenstown Aerodrome needs to be clarified to ensure pilots and controll ers are in no 
doubt as to their respective actions to achieve  separation from other traffic . 
5.7. The minimum required separation between the  2 IFR aeroplanes w as not assured  because 
the approach clearance issued to Qantas  did not allow for a potential communications failure 
and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without 
further instruction, remain in  the visual circuit in the event of not landing  
5.8. Had the Pacific Blue pilots turned b ack towards the aerodrome while climbing to the missed 
approach altitude of 8500 ft, which was possible under PANS -OPS, a more hazardous 
scenario might have ensued, because Qantas  had already been cleared to descend through 
the same area . 
5.9. Airways had not c learly explained to operators that it expected large aircraft that did not land 
at Queenstown after circling to enter the visual aerodrome circuit . 
5.10.  The visual circuit procedure  put in place by Airways for large aircraft at Queenstown should  
have had the  approval of the Director because it was intended as a permanent change that 
introduced or varied right -hand circuits . 
5.11.  Had t he controllers realised that the low cloud around the aerodrome made the visual circuit 
unsuitable for a jet aeroplane, they could  have  protected the missed approach for Pacific Blue 
by a more positive  means, such as not clearing Qantas  for its approach until Pacific Blue had 
landed . 
5.12.  The controllers and the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same 
understanding  of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific Blue 
was circling.  The different text s in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services  at that time 
contributed to that misunderstanding . 
5.13.  Pilots who are not approved for or not familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand 
radioed position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints. The communication gap that this 
potentially creates is a safety issue . 
5.14.  Although not a factor in this incident, t he use of similar titles for  different RNAV approach 
procedures  to the same runway is a hazard that could result in an aircraft flying the wrong 
approach.

 5.15.  It is likely that the level of risk with flight operations at Queenstown Aerodrome has increased 
becau se of changes in the variety and intensity of operations . 
5.16.  There is no effective means of ensuring that the common operational information and 
procedures published by certificated organisations for their internal use are accurate and 
consistent .  That defic iency inevitably results in differences that lead to misunderstandings 
between operational staff, which can compromise the safety of operations.

 Report 10 -007 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by 2 types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation; and  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result  in the Commission issuing a  recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during this inquiry  
6.2. On 10 February 2011, Airways amended AIP page NZQN AD2 -51.3, which described the 
Queenstow n figure -8 circuit procedures , to clarify the direction of turns  and the procedure 
altitudes, and amended the chart sub -heading to read : 
'Procedure if aircraft is maintaining visual reference or circling from an 
instrument approach and unable to land:  … ' [emphasis in original].  
6.3. On 16 June 201 1, Pacific Blue amended its pilot qualification requirements for Queenstown 
Aerodrome to include initial and recurrent simulator training for first officers.  
6.4. On 17 November 2011 , Airways amend ed the Manual of Air Traffic Services and the AIP to 
state  more clearly the minimum weather c onditions  before the missed approach could  be 
protected by instructing a pilot to enter the aerodrome traffic circuit , and the restrictions upon 
a controller's use o f this procedure .  The Manual of Air Traffic Services procedures confirmed 
that protection of the missed approach shall remain in place until the aircraft has landed.  
6.5. On 17 November 2011, the Aerodrome section of the AIP was amended to include the CAA's 
requirement that pilots of any air transport flight operating to or from Queenstown Aerodrome  
be qualified for operations there by a comprehensive briefing. a simulator exercise and a 
minimum of 2 familiarisation flights into and out of the aerodrome.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of, recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.  
7.2. In the intere sts of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendation s 
7.3. On 13 March 2012 , the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil A viation that he:  
7.3.1.  ensure that the strategic plan being developed by Airways and the risk assessment being 
conducted by the CAA in re gard  to Queenstown  Aerodrome address  the following safety issues  
in respect of that aerodrome and, if applicable, generally : 
i. the variability of  procedures used by pilots when  circling  after a non -precision approach 
and in the event of not landing  off an approach  
ii. the separation of aircraft making differe nt types of instrument approach  in Queenstown 
controlled airspace  
iii. the approp riateness of the large aircraft visual circuit procedure  at Queenstown  
iv. the naming convention for RNAV  procedure waypoint s, which makes waypoint 
recognition difficult for pilots  who are not approved for the procedures  (012/12) . 
7.3.2.  take action,  in conjunction with certificated instrument flight procedure service organisation s, 
to eliminate the use of similar procedure titles for different instrument approaches to the 
same r unway (013/12 ) 
7.3.3.  require non -precision approaches at Queenstown to be re -evaluated to determine whether any 
rule exemptions or special procedural requirements are necessary to enable safe circling 
manoeuvres (014/12 ) 
7.3.4.  ensure that operational material published by document holders and approved by the Director 
is accurate and consistent across all users and complies with the prescribed relevant 
standards  (015/12 ) 
7.3.5.  require Airways and the operator of Queenstown Aerodrome  to install a system that provides 
controllers with real -time observation s of the weather conditions behind Dee r Park Hill 
(016/12 ).

 Report 10 -007 8. Key lessons  
8.1. The key lessons  from this inquiry were:  
 a pilot must not descend below the applicable instrument approach minimum descent 
altitude unless certain that the conditions are suitable for a landing  
 pilots must understand the o perational assumptions in the design of instrument approach 
procedures, and how those assumptions determine the limits of safe manoeuvring  
 organisations that re -publish mutually important operational information from authoritative 
source s must ensure that the information is accurately reproduced so that all users 
interpret the information correctly and apply it consistently.
