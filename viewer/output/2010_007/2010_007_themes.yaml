- name: Meteorological Conditions and Terrain Awareness
  explanation: The challenging weather conditions and mountainous terrain around Queenstown Aerodrome are a significant safety theme, as they make aircraft operations more hazardous than at most other airports in New Zealand. The incident highlighted the importance of pilots and controllers having an accurate understanding of the meteorological conditions, especially behind Deer Park Hill, which is critical for maintaining visual contact with the terrain during circling approaches and departures. The report states that "the inability of air traffic controllers and pilots of aircraft taking off to observe the meteorological conditions behind Deer Park Hill, an area in which pilots must be able to maintain visual contact with terrain, is a safety issue that needs to be resolved" (4.2, 4.11, 4.12, 5.2).
- name: Compliance with Approach Procedures
  explanation: Compliance with PANS-OPS requirements and Civil Aviation Rules during non-precision approaches is another safety theme. The report found that pilots, especially those of jet airplanes, cannot always keep the runway in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude, which is a requirement for such approaches. This non-compliance with procedures is a safety issue, as it can lead to misunderstandings between pilots and controllers regarding the expected flight paths during circling maneuvers. "Pilots, particularly those of jet airplanes, making non-precision approaches to Queenstown Aerodrome cannot fully meet the PANS-OPS requirements for such approaches because the runway cannot be kept in sight at all times when circling below the minimum descent altitude" (4.3, 4.16, 4.17, 5.3).
- name: Clarity and Consistency of Operational Documentation
  explanation: The clarity and consistency of operational documentation, such as the AIP, airline operations manuals, and the Manual of Air Traffic Services, are crucial for ensuring that pilots and controllers have a shared understanding of procedures. The report identified inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the documentation, which contributed to the misunderstanding between the pilots and controllers about the protection of the missed approach while circling. "The controllers and the pilots of the Pacific Blue aeroplane did not share the same understanding of how the published missed approach would be protected while Pacific Blue was circling. The different texts in the AIP and the Manual of Air Traffic Services at that time contributed to that misunderstanding" (4.24, 4.47, 4.48, 5.12).
- name: Separation Assurance and Communication Failures
  explanation: Ensuring the minimum required separation between IFR aircraft is a safety theme that emerged from the incident. The approach clearance issued to Qantas did not account for a potential communications failure and was based on an incorrect assumption by controllers that Pacific Blue would remain in the visual circuit if it did not land. This assumption and the lack of a positive instruction for Pacific Blue to enter the visual circuit in the event of not landing led to a situation where separation was not assured. "The minimum required separation between the 2 IFR aeroplanes was not assured because the approach clearance issued to Qantas did not allow for a potential communications failure and it was based on the controllers' shared assumption that Pacific Blue would, without further instruction, remain in the visual circuit in the event of not landing" (4.27, 4.29, 4.30, 4.35, 5.7).
- name: RNAV Procedure Familiarity and Waypoint Naming
  explanation: The familiarity with RNAV procedures and the naming of RNAV waypoints is a safety theme related to this incident. Pilots who are not approved for or familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints, creating a communication gap that can affect safety. Additionally, the use of similar titles for different RNAV approach procedures to the same runway can lead to confusion and potentially result in an aircraft flying the wrong approach. "Pilots who are not approved for or not familiar with RNAV procedures may not understand radioed position reports that refer to RNAV waypoints. The communication gap that this potentially creates is a safety issue" (4.51, 4.52, 4.53, 5.13).
- name: System Drift and Unintended Deviations
  explanation: System drift and unintended deviations from expected standards are a safety theme that encompasses the gradual changes and less-strict adherence to procedures over time. These incremental changes can aggregate and raise the risk profile of operations, as evidenced by the acceptance of circling approaches that at times cannot comply with the rules and the lack of guidance on the acceptability of approaches when there is cloud below the minimum descent altitude. "Seemingly unrelated incremental changes and the condoning of a less-strict adherence to procedures can, over time, aggregate to produce unintended adverse effects on system safety and performance" (4.57, 4.58, 4.59, 4.60, 4.61, 4.62).
