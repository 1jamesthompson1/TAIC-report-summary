Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Failure to implement hot-work precautions: The ship's crew did not fully implement the requirements set out in the safety management system and the hot-work permit, leading to a lack of supervision and readiness of firefighting equipment.

2. Ignition source and fire spread: The fire was likely ignited by molten material from gas-cutting activities, which ignited nearby sawdust. The tight stowage of the cargo made it difficult to control the ejection of hot slag beads and sparks, contributing to the fire's spread.

3. Lack of coordination and understanding between parties: The response to the fire was delayed due to a lack of shared understanding of roles and objectives among the various parties involved. Fire and Emergency NZ initially did not give due regard to the master's command status and knowledge of the ship and its systems.

4. Inadequate training and procedures: The report highlights the need for updated training and procedures for ship fires, as well as a better understanding between local emergency services and visiting foreign vessels to ensure a more effective response in future incidents.
