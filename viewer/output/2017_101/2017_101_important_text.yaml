  \ entry of a train to a worksite  is a serious incident that in this case h ad the\
  \ \npotential to cause harm to the persons maintaining the bridge.  Had the bridge\
  \ support pile that \nwas being replace d been removed, the bridge may have moved\
  \ such as to cause the train to \nderail . \n4.1.2.  The primary defence against\
  \ a train making an unauthori sed entry to a worksite  was Rule 905, \nwhich required\
  \ the driver  to stop the train and request permission from the work g roup  to\
  \ cross \nthe bridge.  The eProtect system was a nother  safety  defence that had\
  \ been put in place in case \nthe first failed.  That sys tem too failed to prevent\
  \ the train entering the worksite . \n4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses how\
  \ and why these systems failed.  \n4.1.4.  Rule 905 relies on the driver being aware\
  \ of the location of the worksite, and seeing and \ncomplying with the warning and\
  \ compulsor y stop boards.  This analysis discusses the various \nfactors that likely\
  \ contributed to the driver not see ing the warning and compulsory stop boards.\
  \  \n4.1.5.  Three  safety issues are discussed:  \n\uF0B7 the KiwiRail medical\
  \ assessment process did not ensure that the employee  being \nassessed completed\
  \ the online medical questionnaire themselves.  There is some \nevidence that the\
  \ system could potentially allow  manage rs or others to complete  the \nquestionnaire\
  \ on employees ' behalf  \n\uF0B7 KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk managem\
  \ ent system to ensure  that relevant \npersonnel perform ed at adequate levels\
  \ of alertness  \n\uF0B7 the eProtect KMC module on board the locomotive  had been\
  \ transmitting error \nmessages for three weeks before the incident , but the activity\
  \ database was not being \nmonitor ed for this type of error . \n4.2. What happened\
  \  \n4.2.1.  At the start of the shift the driver collected a copy of the daily\
  \ information bulletin from the \nKawerau depot.  The driver  noted the planned\
  \ worksite  at Bridge 107 and highlighted the entry \nbecause it would affect the\
  \ route for the train 's return journey  that day  (see Figures 6 and  7).  \nThis\
  \ was almost nine hours before the train entered the worksite  without authorisation.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  In that nine hours the driver took trains from Kawerau to Murupa ra,\
  \ then from Murupa ra to \nMoun t Mau nganui, which involved crossing Bridge 107\
  \ at night before the worksite  was \nestablished for the day.  \n4.2.3.  The driver\
  \  was returning from Mount Mau nganui to Kawerau, nearing the end of a 10\xBD -hour\
  \ \nshift.  Meanwhile the worksite  had been established at Bridge 107.  It was\
  \ daylight and all of \nthe appropriate warning and compulsory stop boards  had\
  \ been erected in the correct locations , \nbut the driver later did  not remember\
  \ seeing any of the warning and compulsory stop board s. \n4.2.4.  The Commission\
  \ considered possible re asons for the driver not seeing  the warning boards . \
  \ \nDistraction from some source might cause driver s to miss one set of warning\
  \ boards.  However, \nit would be  unlikely to cause them  to miss three.  A review\
  \ of mobile phone records showed no \nactivity leadin g up to the incident.  \n\
  4.2.5.  The driver 's description of events suggest ed that the driver  was very\
  \ likely  experiencing \nmicrosleeps when the train was passing the warning  and\
  \ compulsory stop  boards.  Microsleeps \nare described as brief interruption s\
  \ of consciousnes s that last from a few seconds up to a few \nminutes when the\
  \ brain ceases to process visual or audio inputs until the person is \nreawakened.\
  \  The person is effectively disengaged from their environment.  Microsleeps are\
  \ a \nmanifestation of extreme physiologic al sleepiness.  The individual is often\
  \ unaware  that they \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -101 are experiencing\
  \ microsleeps and can still perform basic tasks autonomously , but do not \nregister\
  \ additional audio or visual signs or alarms  (Morgenstern, 2015) . \n4.2.6.  The\
  \ reaso ns for the driver  experiencing microsleeps are discussed in the following\
  \ sections.  \nThe driver recall ed that  the first indication of a worksite was\
  \ seeing  a hi-rail vehicle parked \nbeside  the track near  Bridge  107.  There\
  \ had been a longstanding speed rest riction of 40 km/h \nover both Bridges 105\
  \ and 107 that the driver was well aware of.  The train event recorder \nconfirmed\
  \ that the driver had reduced the speed of the train to 40 k m/h before passing\
  \ over  \nBridge 105.  \n4.2.7.  The driver's first reaction on seeing the hi-rail\
  \ vehicle at Bridge 107 was to refer  briefly  to the \n'speed restrictions '13\
  \ sheet whilst  slow ing the train to 25  km/h as a precaution.  By then the \n\
  train was so close to the bridge that this was all the driver  had time to do. \
  \  \n4.2.8.  The incident show ed that Rule 905 relies heavily on human performance\
  \  to be effective.  The \nintroduction of the eProtect system was a good initiative\
  \ for providing a further technical \ndefence against trains entering worksites\
  \ without authorisation.  \n4.2.9.  However, in this case the  ePro tect system\
  \ did not work due to a technical fault. The eProtect  \nsystem should have automatically\
  \ applied the train brakes when the train did not stop at the \ncompulsory stop\
  \ board s.  The reason for the eProtect system not work ing is analysed further\
  \ in \nthe following sections .  \n4.2.10.  There is no indication inside locomotive\
  \ s to inform drivers that the eProtect system is, or is not, \nfunctioning correctly.\
  \  Drivers do not rely on the system as it does not prevent a driver passing \n\
  compulsory stop board s; instead it m inimises the distance that a  train can pass\
  \ them and \ntherefore the potential consequences.  \n4.3. Human factors  \nSafety\
  \ issue - the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee\
  \ \nbeing assessed completed the online medical questionnaire them selves.  There\
  \ is some \nevidence that the system could potentially allow managers or others\
  \ to complete the \nquestionnaire on  the employees ' behalf.  \n4.3.1.  The Commission\
  \ considered whether fatigue could have been a factor contributing to the driver\
  \ \nmissing the wa rning and compulsory stop boards.  \n4.3.2.  Fatigue is described\
  \ as a complex state characterised by a lack of alertness and reduced \nmental and\
  \ physical performance, often accompanied by drowsiness  (Sirois, 2018) .  Fatigue\
  \ is \nmore than slee piness and its effects are more than falling asleep.  Symptoms\
  \ and \nconsequences include:  \n\uF0B7 measurable changes in performance  \n\uF0B7\
  \ lapses in attention and vigilance  \n\uF0B7 delayed reactions  \n\uF0B7 impaired\
  \ logical reasoning and decision -making  \n\uF0B7 reduced situational awareness\
  \  \n\uF0B7 low motivation for optional activities  \n\uF0B7 poor assessment of\
  \ risk or failure to ap preciate consequences of action  \n\uF0B7 operator inefficiencies\
  \ . \n4.3.3.  The Commission used a Fatigue and Risk Analysis  model  (Health and\
  \ Safety Executive UK, \n2013)  to analyse  the driver's work roster for the period\
  \ leading up to the incident .  The model \n                                   \
  \                     \n13 A separate daily information sheet that lists the v arious\
  \ permanent and temporary speed restrictions for \nthat line.  \n \nFinal Report\
  \ RO -2017 -101 \n<< Page 15 >>\n revealed that the driver's roster was unlikely\
  \ to have, on its own, caused the driver to be \nfatigue d.  The pattern of the\
  \ roster afforded ample time for rest and restora tive sleep.  \n4.3.4.  Having\
  \ just completed two days off duty , the driver had ample opportunity to sleep before\
  \ \ncommencing the shift.  However, opportunity for sleep is not a guarantee that\
  \ adequate sleep is \nobtained.  Lifestyle choices and the quality of sleep are\
  \ important factors as well.  \n4.3.5.  The driver reported having  had a poor -quality\
  \  sleep  before starting the shift due to it being a hot \nand humid night.  \n\
  4.3.6.  Subsequent to the incident the driver was examined by a doctor  and referred\
  \ to Waikato \nHospital to under go a controlled sleep study.  The hospital's Respiratory\
  \ Services Sleep \nLaboratory's sleep specialists completed a Level III sleep study\
  \ .  They diagnosed the driver as \nsuffering from mild obstructive sleep apnoea.\
  \ \n4.3.7.  Obstructive sleep apn oea is the most common type o f sleep apnoea and\
  \ is caused by the \ncomplete or partial blocking of the upper airway during sleep\
  \ .  This reduction in airflow and \nblood oxygen triggers a sudden interruption\
  \ of sleep.  One consequence of sleep apn oea is \nsleep deprivation due to the\
  \ repetit ive disruption of sleep activity.  \n4.3.8.  Adults  with sleep apn oea\
  \ commonly suffer from excessive awake -time sleepiness .  This can \nresult in\
  \ an  individual  falling asleep for brief periods during  the course of their normal\
  \ activities.  \n4.3.9.  There were three factors that very likely contributed to\
  \ the risk of the driver having sleepiness \nepisodes leading up to the incident:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the accumulative effects of sleep apnoea  \n\uF0B7 the stated poor quality\
  \ of sleep prior to the driver's shift  \n\uF0B7 the 10 -plus hours that the driver\
  \  had been 'time awake ' and driving train s during  the \nearly hours of the morning.\
  \  \n4.3.10.  It is difficult to weight these factors in order of effect, but collectively\
  \ they meant it was likely \nthat the driver was experiencing microsleeps when the\
  \ train passed the warning and  \ncompul sory stop boards leading up to the worksite\
  \ . \n4.3.11.  There is evidence that the driver was alert enough to reduce the\
  \ speed of the train to 40 km/h \nfor the permanent speed restriction over both\
  \ bridges.  However, the evidence suggest s that the \ndriver  then lapsed i nto\
  \ one or more microsleeps, which ended or were interrupted when  the hi -\nrail\
  \ vehicle trackside  was sighted . \n4.3.12.  Currently, KiwiRail's periodic medical\
  \ screening programme requires health assessment s of \nstaff in safety -critical\
  \ roles  every five years up to the  age of 50 , every two  years up to the age\
  \ of \n60, and annually thereafter.  The programme consists of an online health\
  \ questionnaire , to be \ncompleted  by an employee before a visit to a KiwiRail\
  \ -approved medical officer for a physical \nexamination.  \n4.3.13.  The Austra\
  \ lian National Transport Commission's  national standard for health assessment\
  \ of rail \nsafety workers has been adopted by the New Zealand National Rail Safety\
  \ Standards Executive, \nand is therefore utilised  by KiwiRail .  The standard\
  \ has been developed from r oading standards \nin Australia, and is formally reviewed\
  \ every four years.  \n www.ntc.gov.au/Media/Reports/(7B079897 -1863 -CA93 -474F\
  \ -AD96AD9C6C3F).pdf  \n4.3.14.  Section 18.6 of the standard deals with sleeping\
  \ disorders and contains a flowchart for the \nassessment of sa fety-critical workers\
  \  (see Figure 13).   Following this flowchart, t he driver in this \ncase score\
  \ d low  both on the  Epworth Sleepiness Scale14 and for their  clinical markers\
  \  such as \n                                                        \n14 A scale\
  \  that measure s awake -time  sleepiness  throu gh the use of a very short questionnaire.\
  \ This can be \nhelpful in diagnosing  sleep disorders . It was introduced in 1991\
  \ by Dr Murray Johns of  Epworth Hospital  in \nMelbourne, Australia . \n\n<< Page\
  \ 16 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -101 BMI and blood pressure ; therefore they did\
  \ not exceed the threshold for referr al for a follow -up \nsleep study.   As part\
  \ of the continuous improvement cycle of the standard there are already \ndiscussion\
  \ documents out for consultation with regards to potential changes to tighten the\
  \ \nstandard .  Many of these proposed changes would likely  have indicated  that\
  \ this driver required \na follow -up sleep study.  \n \nFigure 13 \nAustralian\
  \ National Transport Commission  standard for sleep disorder  assessment  \nof rail\
  \ safety critical workers  \n4.3.15.  In this case the driver  reported that s omeone\
  \ else  had completed the online medical \nquestionnaire part of the medical assessment\
  \ for the driver , before the health assessment .  It is \nnot clear as to  why\
  \ that happened , but it was a clear departure from the KiwiRail procedure, \nand\
  \ of concern.   It is an indication that the importance and safety benefits of the\
  \ medical \nassessment program me were not fully realised by those involved.   \n\
  \n \nFinal Report RO -2017 -101 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.3.16.  Current ly, part of the\
  \ KiwiRail  pre-medical online  question naire  completed by each individual \n\
  utilises  the Epworth Slee piness Scale set of questions  to assess the sleepiness\
  \ of the individual  \nas an initial screening test for sleeping disorders .  Respondents\
  \ are asked to rate their usual \nchances of dozing off or falling asleep whilst\
  \ engaging in eight different activities . \n4.3.17.  KiwiRail acknowledge d that\
  \ the screening tests for sleeping disorders have relatively low validity \nin clinical\
  \ trials  (Satya Krishna Ramachandran MD, 2009) .  Consequently , KiwiRail's rail\
  \ \nmedical officers15 put more weight on th e clinical indications of sleeping\
  \ disorders , such  as BMI \nand high blood pressure  referred to above . \n4.3.18.\
  \  Notwithstanding the fact that the driver did not  personally complete the pre-medical\
  \ \nquestionnaire, w hen the driver  did complete it after the incident , the score\
  \ was not high enough \non the sleepiness scale  to warrant any follow -up under\
  \ the sleeping disorder medical \nassessment procedure  alone .   \n4.3.19.  Subsequent\
  \ to the incident and the diagnosis of sleep apnoea , the driver  has been provided\
  \ \nwith aids to reduce the  effects of sleep apnoea and made  a number of other\
  \ lifestyle changes \nto improve quality of sleep, with reported good results. \
  \ This shows the importance of early \ndetection of sleep disorders and the importance\
  \ of education on lifestyle s for shift workers .  The \nCommission makes a recommendation\
  \ to KiwiRail to ensure that the periodic medical check \nsystem captures data directly\
  \ from the intended subject s. \n4.4. Fatigue management  \nSafety issue - KiwiRail\
  \ did not have a mature fatigue risk management system to ensur e that \nrelevant\
  \ personnel perform ed at adequate levels of alertness.  \n4.4.1.  In section 1\
  \ of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures , rail personnel are \n\
  deemed unfit for duty if they:  \ni. are under the influence of alcohol or drugs\
  \  \nii. have any illness or cond ition, mental or physical, which affects alertness,\
  \ \ncoordination, reaction or safety  \niii. have not sufficiently rested to remain\
  \ alert during their work . \n4.4.2.  As with most operators of transport vehicles,\
  \  train driver s are required to self-certif y whether \nthey are ' fit for duty'\
  \  before attending their allocated shift s.  Due to issues on a national scale\
  \ \nassociated with earthquakes that KiwiRail was dealing with at the time , the\
  \ driver felt self-\npressure d to attend work, despite having had a poor night\
  \ 's sleep .  The d river was also \nconcerned that call ing in unfit for work would\
  \ leave little time to arrange a replacement driver to \ncover the shift.  \n4.4.3.\
  \  Currently KiwiRail use s a FAID software system to assess its master rosters\
  \ for potential fatigue \nissues and also for post -incident analysis.  This type\
  \ of software aims to ensure  that each roster \nposition gives the individual ample\
  \ opportunity to sleep between shifts, and that the roster is \ncompiled according\
  \ to current good roster design princ iples , which include providing cover \ndrivers16.\
  \  The driver's roster was considered normal and was not a factor in this incident.\
  \  \n4.4.4.  A number of other safety -critical transport sectors have introduced\
  \ simple checklists or prompts \n(CAA, 2018)  as part of their fatigue awareness\
  \  training and education, to assist individuals in \ndetermin ing if  they are\
  \ fit for duty (see Figure 1 4). \n                                            \
  \            \n15 A rail medical officer is a qualified general pr actitioner engaged\
  \ by KiwiRail to complete medical \nassessments of employees and prospective employees\
  \ in a specific locale.  \n16 A spare driver planned into a roster who steps in\
  \ if a rostered driver is unable to complete a particular \nshift.   \n\n<< Page\
  \ 18 >>\n Final Report RO -2017 -101  \nFigure 14 \nExample fitness -for-work prompt\
  \ sheet  \n4.4.5.  On the day of the incident the cover driver planned for the KiwiR\
  \ ail Kawerau roster had already \nbeen assigned to cover another driver.  Other\
  \ drivers who were not rostered to work on this day \nmay have been able to cover\
  \ the shift, but may not have been  adjusted to a night -shift work \npattern .\
  \ \n4.4.6.  In November 2016 KiwiRail he ld fatigue management w orkshops with the\
  \ Rail and Maritime \nTransport Union and Professor Philippa Gander from the Sleep/Wake\
  \ Research Centre at \nMassey University Wellington.  As part of th ese workshop\
  \ s a new regulatory approach in the \nform of a  fatigue risk management system\
  \ (Medicine, 2012)  was identified as the next step in \nfatigue management at \
  \ KiwiRail.  T his is a data -driven safety management syst em that is based \n\
  on combined scientific and operational expertise and includes  processes for monitoring\
  \ safety \nperformance and continuous improvement.  A fatigue risk management system\
  \ i s made up of \nfour parts:  \ni. organisational components  \n\uF0B7 fatigue\
  \ risk management policy and documentation  \n\uF0B7 fatigue risk management promotional\
  \ processes - education and training  \nii. operational components  \n\uF0B7 fatigue\
  \ risk management processes  \n\uF0B7 fatigue risk management safety assurance processes\
  \ . \n4.4.7.  KiwiRail currently ha s a draft fatigue risk management system  policy\
  \ for locomotive engineer s \nand train controller s, plus a number of existing\
  \ processes and systems that fit within a fatigue \nrisk management system .  KiwiRail\
  \ has used gap analysis to identify missing parts from  its \nexisting fatigue management\
  \ system s and assigned  actions to address these shortfalls.   While \nsome of\
  \ these missing parts have been addressed , others are still work s in progress.\
  \  \n4.4.8.  Driving trains is a safety -critical role .  Additional guidance and\
  \ training may have helped the \ndriver  to evaluate their  condition better before\
  \ attending the shift.  \n4.4.9.  The Commis sion makes a recommendation to KiwiRail\
  \ to ensure  that a comprehensive fatigue \nrisk management system continues to\
  \ be  developed and fully implemented within the \norganisation.  \n4.5. Technical\
  \ factors  \nSafety issue - The eProtect KMC module on the locomotive  had been\
  \ transmitting  error \nmessages  for three weeks before the incident , but the\
  \ activity database was not being  \nmonitor ed for this type of error . \n4.5.1.\
  \  An interrogati on of the eProtect activity database logs  from KiwiRail  showed\
  \  that the KMC \nmodule on board the inci dent locomotive had started to send self-generated\
  \ error messages \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2017 -101 \n<< Page 19 >>\n from  16 January\
  \ 2017, three weeks before the incident.  The error messages indicated that the\
  \ \nKMC module was capable of receiv ing worksite positions from Train Control ,\
  \ but it was unable \nto write the m to memory.   This meant the KMC module had\
  \ no worksite details with which to  \ncompare the train 's current GPS position\
  \ and could not take action when the train passed the \ncompulsory stop board s.\
  \ \n4.5.2.  The Commission obtained the eProtect KMC module from  the locomotive\
  \ involved in the  \nincident.  The module was forensic ally examin ed with assistance\
  \ provided by  the KMC module \nmanufacturer.  The module was the processor of the\
  \ eProtect system on board the locomotive .  \nIt receive d details of rail worksite\
  \ loc ations around New Zealand using the mobile phone \nnetwork, and compare d\
  \ them to the real -time GPS position s of the locomotive.  As mentioned \npreviously,\
  \ t he KMC module was designed to alert driver s when the ir locomotive s were \
  \ \napproaching known worksite loca tions, and if necessary  take action should\
  \ the train s approach \nthe worksite s too fast or fail to stop at compulsory stop\
  \ boards.  \n4.5.3.  The examination of the KMC module identified a  hardware fault\
  \ , which was traced to a failed \nintegrated circuit chip.  The integ rated circuit\
  \ chip was  used  by the KMC module to switch its \nmemory power  source  from the\
  \ external 12 -volt supply to an internal battery backup whenever \nthe locomotive\
  \ was powered down .   \n4.5.4.  It was not possible to determine why the chip failed\
  \ .  The design and  manufacturing \nspecifications did not indicate a lifecycle\
  \ for this type of integrated circuit chip.  However, \nirrespective  of why the\
  \ chip  and subsequently the  KMC module failed, the issue is that  the \nmodule\
  \ had reported the error to the eProtect activity  log database , but the monitoring\
  \  process \nhad not pick ed up the error message .   \n4.5.5.  Without the ability\
  \ to write the location of the worksite  at Bridge 107 to its memory, the KMC \n\
  module was not aware of its existence.  Thus the data for the location of the co\
  \ mpulsory stop \nboards  was missing, and that is why the eProtect system  failed\
  \ to apply the train brakes when \nthe train did not stop at the boards.  \n4.5.6.\
  \  During the development of the eProtect system, the KMC module was programmed\
  \ to send \nmessages back to the ePro tect activity log database , which  in turn\
  \ notified  four different \naddressees at KiwiRail by email when certain conditions\
  \ occurred.  These conditions included a \nvariety of faults and errors, including\
  \ GPS faults and communication errors .  However , the \nparticular mode of failure\
  \ that occu rred in this instance had not been envisaged, so the system \nwas not\
  \ programmed to generate an  email alert to KiwiRail staff . \n4.5.7.  The lack\
  \ of  an email or other warning message being generated by the eProtect system \
  \ meant  \nthe KMC module was sending error messages to the eProtect activity log\
  \ database , alerting that \nit could not write the worksite GPS details into its\
  \ on -board memory .  However , these error \nmessages were not identified  or acted\
  \ on because  the eProtect activity databa se was not \nactively monitored by KiwiRail\
  \ for this type of occurrence .   \n4.5.8.  The specification, development, tria\
  \ lling and rollout of the eProtect system by KiwiRail and its \ncontractors were\
  \  comprehensive .  From the r ecords detailing the system requirements, \ndevelopment\
  \ and testing that were provided to the Commission , it is apparent that not all\
  \ the \nmodes of failure of the KMC module or the eProtect system were fully understood\
  \ and planned \nfor before the system was put into service .  No failure mode analysis\
  \ had been undertaken on \nthe system , and this specif ic mode of failure  was\
  \ not being monitored .  The Commission has \nmade a recommendation on this issue\
  \ in report RO2017 -102.  \n4.5.9.  When the eProtect system works  correctly it\
  \ greatly enhances  safety  around protected \nworksites .  Although the eProtect\
  \ system is considered a n additional  safety  defence against \ntrains inadvertently\
  \ entering worksite s without authorisation, its function is important , \nparticularly\
  \ when the primary defence is reliant on human fact ors. \n4.5.10.  KiwiRai l has\
  \ made technical changes to the eProtect system to address t his safety issue ;\
  \ see \nsection 6.  \n\n<< Page 20 >>"
