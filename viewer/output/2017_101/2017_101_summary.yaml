- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 40
  explanation: The driver's fatigue and reduced alertness were significant contributors to the incident. The driver likely experienced microsleeps due to a combination of factors including mild obstructive sleep apnoea, poor sleep quality prior to the shift, and being awake for over 10 hours during a night shift (5.2, 5.3). These factors impaired the driver's ability to observe and respond to the warning and compulsory stop boards, leading to the unauthorised entry into the worksite.
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 30
  explanation: Human error played a critical role in the incident. The driver did not see the warning and compulsory stop boards due to microsleeps, which is a form of human error. Additionally, the eProtect system, which was supposed to provide a safety defense, failed due to a technical error that was not detected and rectified by KiwiRail staff (5.6). The lack of a full failure mode analysis for the eProtect system before it was put into service indicates a gap in error management (5.7).
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The eProtect system's failure due to a technical error in the processing unit on board the locomotive contributed to the incident. The system did not alert the driver or apply the train brakes when the train did not stop at the compulsory stop boards (5.6). The lack of a full failure mode analysis and the specific mode of failure not being monitored indicate issues with the equipment design and specifications (5.7).
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The driver's undetected sleep apnoea and the subsequent failure to manage the risk of fatigue highlight issues with regulatory compliance and safety management. KiwiRail's health assessment process did not ensure that the driver completed the online medical questionnaire themselves, which could have identified the sleep disorder earlier (5.4). Additionally, KiwiRail's fatigue risk management system was still under development and not fully implemented at the time of the incident (5.5).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The incident revealed that the importance and safety benefits of KiwiRail's health assessment program were not fully realized by those involved (5.4). The driver felt pressured to attend work despite poor sleep, indicating potential issues with the organization's culture regarding fitness for duty (4.4.2). The lack of active monitoring of the eProtect activity database for specific types of errors also points to organizational influences affecting safety performance (4.5.7).
