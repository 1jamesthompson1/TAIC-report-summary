- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 40
  explanation: The driver's fatigue was a significant contributing factor to the incident. The driver was likely experiencing microsleeps due to a combination of factors including mild obstructive sleep apnoea, poor sleep quality prior to the shift, and being awake for over 10 hours during a night shift (5.3). The driver's condition was not detected by KiwiRail's health assessment, and the fatigue risk management system was still under development, which could have provided additional guidance (5.4, 5.5).
