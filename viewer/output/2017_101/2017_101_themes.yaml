- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  explanation: "Fatigue and alertness are critical human factors in transportation safety, particularly for operators of vehicles like train drivers. In this incident, the driver likely experienced microsleeps due to a combination of factors including mild obstructive sleep apnea, poor sleep quality prior to the shift, and being awake for over 10 hours during a night shift. These factors contributed to the driver not seeing the warning and compulsory stop boards, leading to an unauthorized entry into the worksite. \"The reason for the driver not seeing the outer warning and compulsory stop boards was that the driver was likely experiencing microsleeps at the time\" (5.2). \"the driver was very likely susceptible to experiencing microsleeps due to a combination of the following factors: the driver suffered from mild obstructive sleep apnoea, which was affecting the quality of sleep; the driver had experienced a poor night's sleep before beginning the night shift, due to the hot ambient temperature; the driver had been awake for more than 10 hours and was nearing the end of a 10\xBD-hour night shift\" (5.3 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))."
- name: Medical Assessment and Health Monitoring
  explanation: The medical assessment and health monitoring of safety-critical workers are essential to ensure they are fit for duty. In this case, the driver's undetected mild obstructive sleep apnea was a contributing factor to the incident. The medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee completed the online medical questionnaire themselves, which could have led to an underestimation of the driver's sleepiness and risk of microsleeps. "The safety benefits derived from the KiwiRail safety-critical worker health assessment were not fully realised by those involved, and as a result the driver's sleep apnoea had gone undetected" (5.4). "In this case the driver reported that someone else had completed the online medical questionnaire part of the medical assessment for the driver, before the health assessment" (4.3.15).
- name: Fatigue Risk Management Systems
  explanation: A comprehensive fatigue risk management system is necessary to ensure that personnel perform at adequate levels of alertness. KiwiRail's draft fatigue risk management system policy was still under development at the time of the incident. A more mature system might have provided additional guidance to drivers to better evaluate their condition before attending shifts, potentially preventing the incident. "KiwiRail has a draft fatigue risk management system policy that is still under development. Had the current system been able to provide additional guidance to drivers, it may have helped them to evaluate their condition better before attending shifts" (5.5).
- name: Technical Failures - eProtect System
  explanation: Technical failures in safety systems can lead to incidents when they are relied upon as a defense against human error. The eProtect system on the locomotive failed to alert the driver or apply the train brakes automatically due to a hardware fault in the processing unit, which had been transmitting error messages for three weeks prior to the incident. This failure was not detected because the system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service. "The eProtect system was a safety defence for preventing trains inadvertently entering worksites without authorisation. The system did not work on this occasion because a technical error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected and rectified by KiwiRail staff" (5.6).
- name: Safety System Monitoring and Response
  explanation: Continuous monitoring and timely response to safety system alerts are crucial for preventing incidents. In this case, the eProtect system's error messages were not acted upon because the eProtect activity database was not actively monitored by KiwiRail for this type of occurrence. This oversight allowed the technical fault to persist and contributed to the incident. "The error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected because the eProtect system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being put into service" (5.7).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  explanation: An organization's safety culture influences the effectiveness of safety measures and the likelihood of incidents. In this incident, the importance and safety benefits of the medical assessment program were not fully realized by those involved, indicating a potential gap in the safety culture at KiwiRail. Ensuring that employees understand and adhere to safety procedures is essential for preventing incidents. "It is an indication that the importance and safety benefits of the medical assessment programme were not fully realised by those involved" (4.3.15).
