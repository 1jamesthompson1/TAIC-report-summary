The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents 
and incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency  to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 7 February 2017 work had beg un on replacing  a support pile under a rail bridge on a single -
line section of track between Mount Maunganui and Kawerau on the East Coast Main Trunk 
line.  Two sets of warning boards had been placed either side of the worksite to alert train 
drivers to the worksite ahead.  A set of compulsory stop boards had been placed 500 metres 
from either side of the  worksite, where train  drivers  were required to stop and request 
permission to enter the worksite from the rail protection officer of the maintenance team.  
1.2. At about 1000 a freight train was en route from Mount Maunganui to Kawerau.  The driver was 
nearing the end of a 10½ -hour night shift.  Later, t he driver did not recall seeing any of the 
warning or compulsory stop boards and only noticed the presence of a hi-rail maintenance 
vehicle beside the track as the train was approaching the bridge.  The driver  reduced the train 
speed to 25 kilometres per hour shortly before crossing the bridge without authorisation.  
1.3. The rail maintenance workers were working under t he bridge at the time, about to remove one 
of the support piles.  Nobody was injured and there was no damage to the train or bridge.  
1.4. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  it likely that the driver 
was experiencing 'microsleeps ' at the time the train passed the warning and stop boards.  The 
driver was later diagnosed as suffering  from a sleep disorder that affect s the quality of  sleep .  
Additionally, the driver  had had difficulty sleeping the evening prior to the incident due to  the 
hot ambient temperature.  The fact  that the driver  had been awake for more than  10 hours 
through the night and was nearing the end of the shift was also a factor . 
1.5. The train locomotive was fitted with a global -positioning -based safety  system  (eProtect ) that 
should have automatically applied the train brakes when the train failed to stop at the 
compulsory stop board s.  The Commission found  that this safety  defence failed due to an 
unnoticed error within the device on board this particular locomotive that was preventing it 
utilising  the global positioning  system 's location of the worksite . 
1.6. The Commission identified three safety issues:  
 the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee being 
assessed completed the online medical ques tionnaire themselves.  There is some 
evidence that the system could potentially allow managers or others to complete the 
questionnaire on employees ' behalf  
 KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk management system to ensure  that relevant 
personnel perf ormed at adequate levels of alertness  
 the eProtect KMC module  on this locomotive had been transmitting error messages for 
three weeks before the incident , but the activity database was not being monitored for 
this type of error . 
1.7. KiwiRail took  a safety acti on to address the issue with the eProtect system, and the Commission 
made two recommendations  to KiwiRail to address issues with its medical assessment 
program me and its fatigue risk management system.  
1.8. Key lessons  arising from the inquiry were:  
 train drive rs and other shift workers need to ensure that they are medically fit and 
make appropriate lifestyle choices that will enhance the amount and quality of  their  
sleep, in order to avoid being fatigued or tired while at work  
 transport operators must ensure that their staff are fully educated on the factors that 
can cause or contribute to their becoming tired or fatigued while performing safety -
critical roles  
 technological systems need to be fully tested and have undergone full failure mode 
analysis if they are  going to be relied on as safety defences  for preventing accidents 
and incidents .

 Final Report RO -2017 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry   
2.1. The incident occurred at 1015 on Tuesday 7  February 2017 .  The NZ Transport Agency notified 
the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commissio n) soon after the incident 
occurred.   The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 to determine the circumstances and causes of the incident 
and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. Commis sion investigators travelled to KiwiRail's Mount Ma unganui  terminal and the Pongakawa 
incident site on Wednesday  8 February  to conduct the site investigation .   
2.3. Commission investigators interviewed:  
 the locomotive engineer (train driver)  
 the bridge work gr oup2 
 the manufacturer of the eProtect3 system  
 KiwiRail 's eProtect database system administrator . 
2.4. The investigators  obtained documents and records for analysis , including : 
 Tranzlog4 data from the train  
 a copy of the eProtect activity database  
 documentation related to the  specification, development, testing  and introduction  of, 
training  in and rollout of the eProtect system  
 records of the train driver 's post-incident sleep study . 
2.5. The KMC  (Kupe Mobile Controller ) module5 from on board the locomotive was seized  by the 
Commission for forensic software and hardware analysis.  
2.6. On 19 April 2018 the Commissioners considered a draft report and approved it to be sent to 12 
interested persons for consultation.   
2.7. The Commission received three submissions.  The Commission  considered the submissions, 
and changes as a result of those submissions  have been included in the final report.  
2.8. On 23 August 2018 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  Tuesday 7 February 2017, t he day  of the incident , was the first of three planned days of repair 
work on Bridge 107, w hich involved  replacing a section of wooden support pile under  the 
bridge.   
3.1.2.  The work involved dismantling a wooden support from the bridge and replacing the lower 
section  with a m etal sleeve filled with concrete (see Figure 2).  With the lower section of the 
support rem oved , the bridge would have been deemed unusable  until the replacement pile was 
in place.   There would have been a risk of damage to the repair had a train traversed over the 
bridge before the concrete used in the repair had set, a window of between 45 minutes and one 
hour.  
 
Figure 2 
The repaired section of bridge support  
3.1.3.  On the same day the train driver involved in the incident star ted a shift in Kawerau at 0115.  
The driver took  an empty freight train from Kawerau to Murupar a and then took  a loaded log 
train from Murupar a to Mount Maunganui, which involved crossing Bridge 107 before the 
worksite  had been established.  The driver the n departed Mount Maunganui on  Train 371 (the 
train) bound for  Kawerau, which was scheduled to pass over Bridge 107 after the worksite  had 
been established  (see Figure 3 ). 
3.1.4.  The worksite  was protected using KiwiRail Rule 905.  Compulsory stop boards  were ere cted 
either side of the worksite , at which the train had to  stop and gain permission to pass and enter 
the worksite .  Outer caution boards and whistle boards were erected before the compulsory 
stop boards.  The purpose of the outer caution boards was to al ert the driver to the compulsory 
stop boards ahead.  The whistle boards were a prompt for the driver to sound the train whistle 
to warn the work group  of the train 's approach (see section 3.3  for more detail ).

 3.2. Narrative  
3.2.1.  A three -person  work group had been assigned to the Bridge 107 worksite .  They had placed the 
caution boards, the whistle boards and the compulsory stop boards either side of their worksite .  
The compulsory stop boards were placed 500  metres  (m) out from the worksite  (see Figure 4).  
They then  called Train Control6 at 0830 to confirm the worksite had been established.  
 
Figure 4 
The warning boards and compulsory stop boards for the  worksite  
3.2.2.  Train Control advised the work g roup  that the first train through the worksite would arrive at 
approximately 0935 , heading south .   
3.2.3.  At approximately 1000 the train comprising a single locomotive hauling 30 empty wagons 
approached Bridge 105 on the East Coast Main Trunk line (see Figure 5). 
3.2.4.  The driver slowed the train for the longstanding 40-kilometre -per-hour (km/h) speed restriction7 
over Bridge 105.

Location of Bridges 105 and 107   
(Image source - Google Maps ) 
3.2.5.  After crossing Bridge 105 the train was allowed to gather speed before the driver started to 
slow again for another longstanding 40  km/h speed restriction over Bridge 107.  
3.2.6.  The driver did not notice either the outer caution boards or the whis tle boa rds, and  did not 
sound the train horn . 
3.2.7.  As the train approached Bridge 107 the driver noticed a hi-rail vehicle8 on the far side of the 
bridge .  This prompted the driver  to check the daily speed restriction bulletin9 to ensure  that the 
speed limit over Bridge 107 had not been lowered below 40  km/h due to work on the bridge.   
The driver slowed to 25  km/h to be on the safe side.  
3.2.8.  As the train crossed the bridge the driver noticed one of the site workers  walking towards the hi -
rail vehicle.  
3.2.9.  After the train had cross ed the bridge , the driver received a radio call asking  why the train  had 
not stop ped at the compulsory stop boards . 
3.2.10.  The bridge support that the work group was replac ing had been dismantled but had yet to be 
cut when  the train passed over the bri dge. 
3.2.11.  The driver stopped the train , with th e rear of the train approximately 600 m beyond  Bridge 107.  
3.2.12.  Two of the three -person  bridge work group  members  were working under the bridge when the 
train passed directly over their heads ( see Figure 6).

Figure 6 
Location of bridge work group members when the train  crossed Bridge 107 
3.2.13.  The train had passed the compulsory stop boards by 1.6  kilometres ; it passed through the 
worksite and nearly reached  the far side of the protected area when it  stopp ed.  Passing 
compulsory stop boards without permission is classed as a Signal Passed at Danger 'A'10. 
3.2.14.  The locomotive was fitted with  an automatic system  called eProtect, which was supposed to 
have alerted the driver when the train was approaching the worksite .  The same system was 
designed to automatically apply the brakes on the train if it did not stop at the compulsory stop 
board s.  The system did not provide any alert to the driver, and did not automatically apply the 
train brakes.  
3.3. Compulsory stop board worksite protection system (Rule 905)  
3.3.1.  Worksites are normally planned and authorised in advance for planned work and maintenance.  
3.3.2.  Every day a daily information bulletin (see Figu re 7) is promulgated  by KiwiRail by  geographical 
area .  It is available at each depot and provided to all train drivers before th ey start their shift s.  
Drivers often highlight sections pertinent to their train s and route s, as seen in Figure 7.  The 
daily information bulletin  contain s detail s of: 
i. additional trains running in th e area  
ii. special instruction s that could  be required for any additional trains  
iii. track work protection arrangements  in the area covered by the bulletin , which  
include:  
 the area covered by the protected worksite, including meterage where 
appropriate  
 which speci fic type of protection rule will be  in force for each worksite  
 the times that the worksite and protection will  be in place  
 the radio  call sign of the worksite  
 a brief description of the work being undertaken  
 a contact mobile number for the worksi te, to be used if the worksite rail 
protection o fficer11 cannot be reached by radio  
 an indication that the worksite is protected by the eProtect system .

11  The person in a work group who is respo nsible for all those working at the worksite.  They authorise worker 
access to the track and trains to pass through the worksite once the track is confirmed clear as required.

 3.3.3.  On the day of the incident the worksite  was protected  using KiwiRail Rule 905 - Compulsory 
Stop Protection .  The rule require d two sets of warning boards  to be erected alongside the track 
to warn a ll train driver s that they are approac hing a set of c ompulsory stop board s.  The train is 
required to  stop at the compulsory stop boards (see Figure 8).  The w orksite was also protected 
by the eProtect system , as indicated by the  icon on the daily information bulletin (see Figure 
9).

3.3.4.  Once stationary at the compulsory stop boards  the train driver had to  radio the rail protection 
officer  to request  permission to access the worksite .  This communication would give  the rail 
protection officer  the opportunity to confirm that the worksite was clear and safe for the train to 
pass through, and impose any special conditions on the train , such as further reduced speed 
through the site.

 Final Report RO -2017 -101 3.4. eProtect system  
3.4.1.  eProtect is a safety  defence  that utilises the real -time GPS (global positioning system) position  
of a train alongside technology  on board the locomotive to warn the driv er that the train is 
approaching a worksite .  It automatically applies the train's brakes if it approaches too fast or 
fails to stop at a set of  compulsory stop board s.  
3.4.2.  On 21 July 2016 KiwiRail issued Semi Permanent Bulletin No. 489 , which stated:  
eProtec t is a system on locomotives that uses GPS technology to monitor the speed 
of trains approaching Compulsory Stop Boards, and penalty brakes the train if it does 
not stop at the Compulsory Stop Boards.  
The bulletin  stated  that the eProtect system would be g oing live on all lines as the training of 
"affected drivers and applicable Rail Protection Officers was complete d". 
3.4.3.  The eProtect system utilises existing technology on board KiwiRail's locomotives, tak ing the 
trains ' real-time GPS position s and compar ing them with  the latest information on worksite 
locations  around New Zealand .  The locations of the worksites are sent to all locomotives over 
the mobile phone network (see Figure 10).   
 
Figure 10 
eProtect system data diagram  
3.4.4.  There a re three interconnected systems on each locomotive that work together to provide the 
eProtect system (see Figure 1 1). These are:  
i. a GPS unit , which receives the real-time GPS position of the locomotive  
ii. a KMC module , which was  initially installed to monitor  train locations  and send train 
GPS positions back to Train Control .  The KMC module was modified to receive and 
store locations of worksites aroun d New Zealand  via the mobile network , and 
monitor the position of the locomotive in relation to the location s of the worksite s 
iii. a Tranzlog event recorder , which  monitors and records the details of the 
locomotive's  control settings .  The Tranzlog can automatically apply the brakes if it 
receives a signal from the KMC module  to do so.

eProtect system component parts on  board locomotives  
3.4.5.  When a  locomotive arrives at the outer caution boards of a worksite , the eProtect system is 
configured to  sound a signal alert alarm12 to notify the driver.  At 500  m and 300  m from the 
compulsory st op boards  the system checks that the speed of the locomotive is below 40 km/h 
and 35 km/h respectively .  If not, the system activate s the locomotive brakes automatically .  At 
the compulsory stop boards,  eProtect checks that the locomotive remains stationar y for at least 
10 seconds .  If not,  it appl ies the locomotive brakes automatically (see Figure 1 2).

Stages of eProtect system checks  
3.4.6.  An eProtect system brake activation will  not necessarily prevent a locomotive passing 
compulsory stop boards.  It is intended to minimise the distance that a locomotive can move 
past the boards  and prevent it entering an area where work is being undertaken .  
3.4.7.  The eProtect system utilises  both GPS and mobile phone signals, which can be affect ed by local 
terrain and tunnel s.  KiwiRail considers that t he eProtect system was designed and 
implemented as a supplementary overlay system, thereby  providing a nother  safety  defence to 
the primary defence achieved by Rule 905 .  The primary protection for workers at a worksite is 
the train driver observ ing and stopping at the compulsory stop boards.

 Final Report RO -2017 -101 3.5. The train driver  
3.5.1.  The train driver was based at Kawerau , and  at the time of the incident had seven years ' 
experience driving freight trains  for KiwiRail .  The d river held current certification and had a 
good driving record  at the time of the incident . 
3.5.2.  The driver had returned to work following  two rostered days off .  In prep aration for the night 
shift the driver  had gone  to bed at approximately 1900 and woke n at about 00 00 on Tuesday 7 
February.  The driver had a  one-hour commute from Rotorua to Kawerau before  start ing the 
shift at 0115 .  The driver  later reported having  had difficult y sleep ing the night before the shift 
because of the high ambient temperature . 
3.5.3.  Following the incident the  driver was relieved of duty and underwent a post -incident drug and 
alcohol test.  The result of the test was negative .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The unauthorised entry of a train to a worksite  is a serious incident that in this case h ad the 
potential to cause harm to the persons maintaining the bridge.  Had the bridge support pile that 
was being replace d been removed, the bridge may have moved such as to cause the train to 
derail . 
4.1.2.  The primary defence against a train making an unauthori sed entry to a worksite  was Rule 905, 
which required the driver  to stop the train and request permission from the work g roup  to cross 
the bridge.  The eProtect system was a nother  safety  defence that had been put in place in case 
the first failed.  That sys tem too failed to prevent the train entering the worksite . 
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses how and why these systems failed.  
4.1.4.  Rule 905 relies on the driver being aware of the location of the worksite, and seeing and 
complying with the warning and compulsor y stop boards.  This analysis discusses the various 
factors that likely contributed to the driver not see ing the warning and compulsory stop boards.  
4.1.5.  Three  safety issues are discussed:  
 the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee  being 
assessed completed the online medical questionnaire themselves.  There is some 
evidence that the system could potentially allow  manage rs or others to complete  the 
questionnaire on employees ' behalf  
 KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk managem ent system to ensure  that relevant 
personnel perform ed at adequate levels of alertness  
 the eProtect KMC module on board the locomotive  had been transmitting error 
messages for three weeks before the incident , but the activity database was not being 
monitor ed for this type of error . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  At the start of the shift the driver collected a copy of the daily information bulletin from the 
Kawerau depot.  The driver  noted the planned worksite  at Bridge 107 and highlighted the entry 
because it would affect the route for the train 's return journey  that day  (see Figures 6 and  7).  
This was almost nine hours before the train entered the worksite  without authorisation.  
4.2.2.  In that nine hours the driver took trains from Kawerau to Murupa ra, then from Murupa ra to 
Moun t Mau nganui, which involved crossing Bridge 107 at night before the worksite  was 
established for the day.  
4.2.3.  The driver  was returning from Mount Mau nganui to Kawerau, nearing the end of a 10½ -hour 
shift.  Meanwhile the worksite  had been established at Bridge 107.  It was daylight and all of 
the appropriate warning and compulsory stop boards  had been erected in the correct locations , 
but the driver later did  not remember seeing any of the warning and compulsory stop board s. 
4.2.4.  The Commission considered possible re asons for the driver not seeing  the warning boards .  
Distraction from some source might cause driver s to miss one set of warning boards.  However, 
it would be  unlikely to cause them  to miss three.  A review of mobile phone records showed no 
activity leadin g up to the incident.  
4.2.5.  The driver 's description of events suggest ed that the driver  was very likely  experiencing 
microsleeps when the train was passing the warning  and compulsory stop  boards.  Microsleeps 
are described as brief interruption s of consciousnes s that last from a few seconds up to a few 
minutes when the brain ceases to process visual or audio inputs until the person is 
reawakened.  The person is effectively disengaged from their environment.  Microsleeps are a 
manifestation of extreme physiologic al sleepiness.  The individual is often unaware  that they 

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -101 are experiencing microsleeps and can still perform basic tasks autonomously , but do not 
register additional audio or visual signs or alarms  (Morgenstern, 2015) . 
4.2.6.  The reaso ns for the driver  experiencing microsleeps are discussed in the following sections.  
The driver recall ed that  the first indication of a worksite was seeing  a hi-rail vehicle parked 
beside  the track near  Bridge  107.  There had been a longstanding speed rest riction of 40 km/h 
over both Bridges 105 and 107 that the driver was well aware of.  The train event recorder 
confirmed that the driver had reduced the speed of the train to 40 k m/h before passing over  
Bridge 105.  
4.2.7.  The driver's first reaction on seeing the hi-rail vehicle at Bridge 107 was to refer  briefly  to the 
'speed restrictions '13 sheet whilst  slow ing the train to 25  km/h as a precaution.  By then the 
train was so close to the bridge that this was all the driver  had time to do.   
4.2.8.  The incident show ed that Rule 905 relies heavily on human performance  to be effective.  The 
introduction of the eProtect system was a good initiative for providing a further technical 
defence against trains entering worksites without authorisation.  
4.2.9.  However, in this case the  ePro tect system did not work due to a technical fault. The eProtect  
system should have automatically applied the train brakes when the train did not stop at the 
compulsory stop board s.  The reason for the eProtect system not work ing is analysed further in 
the following sections .  
4.2.10.  There is no indication inside locomotive s to inform drivers that the eProtect system is, or is not, 
functioning correctly.  Drivers do not rely on the system as it does not prevent a driver passing 
compulsory stop board s; instead it m inimises the distance that a  train can pass them and 
therefore the potential consequences.  
4.3. Human factors  
Safety issue - the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee 
being assessed completed the online medical questionnaire them selves.  There is some 
evidence that the system could potentially allow managers or others to complete the 
questionnaire on  the employees ' behalf.  
4.3.1.  The Commission considered whether fatigue could have been a factor contributing to the driver 
missing the wa rning and compulsory stop boards.  
4.3.2.  Fatigue is described as a complex state characterised by a lack of alertness and reduced 
mental and physical performance, often accompanied by drowsiness  (Sirois, 2018) .  Fatigue is 
more than slee piness and its effects are more than falling asleep.  Symptoms and 
consequences include:  
 measurable changes in performance  
 lapses in attention and vigilance  
 delayed reactions  
 impaired logical reasoning and decision -making  
 reduced situational awareness  
 low motivation for optional activities  
 poor assessment of risk or failure to ap preciate consequences of action  
 operator inefficiencies . 
4.3.3.  The Commission used a Fatigue and Risk Analysis  model  (Health and Safety Executive UK, 
2013)  to analyse  the driver's work roster for the period leading up to the incident .  The model 
                                                        
13 A separate daily information sheet that lists the v arious permanent and temporary speed restrictions for 
that line.  
 
Final Report RO -2017 -101 
<< Page 15 >>
 revealed that the driver's roster was unlikely to have, on its own, caused the driver to be 
fatigue d.  The pattern of the roster afforded ample time for rest and restora tive sleep.  
4.3.4.  Having just completed two days off duty , the driver had ample opportunity to sleep before 
commencing the shift.  However, opportunity for sleep is not a guarantee that adequate sleep is 
obtained.  Lifestyle choices and the quality of sleep are important factors as well.  
4.3.5.  The driver reported having  had a poor -quality  sleep  before starting the shift due to it being a hot 
and humid night.  
4.3.6.  Subsequent to the incident the driver was examined by a doctor  and referred to Waikato 
Hospital to under go a controlled sleep study.  The hospital's Respiratory Services Sleep 
Laboratory's sleep specialists completed a Level III sleep study .  They diagnosed the driver as 
suffering from mild obstructive sleep apnoea. 
4.3.7.  Obstructive sleep apn oea is the most common type o f sleep apnoea and is caused by the 
complete or partial blocking of the upper airway during sleep .  This reduction in airflow and 
blood oxygen triggers a sudden interruption of sleep.  One consequence of sleep apn oea is 
sleep deprivation due to the repetit ive disruption of sleep activity.  
4.3.8.  Adults  with sleep apn oea commonly suffer from excessive awake -time sleepiness .  This can 
result in an  individual  falling asleep for brief periods during  the course of their normal activities.  
4.3.9.  There were three factors that very likely contributed to the risk of the driver having sleepiness 
episodes leading up to the incident:  
 the accumulative effects of sleep apnoea  
 the stated poor quality of sleep prior to the driver's shift  
 the 10 -plus hours that the driver  had been 'time awake ' and driving train s during  the 
early hours of the morning.  
4.3.10.  It is difficult to weight these factors in order of effect, but collectively they meant it was likely 
that the driver was experiencing microsleeps when the train passed the warning and  
compul sory stop boards leading up to the worksite . 
4.3.11.  There is evidence that the driver was alert enough to reduce the speed of the train to 40 km/h 
for the permanent speed restriction over both bridges.  However, the evidence suggest s that the 
driver  then lapsed i nto one or more microsleeps, which ended or were interrupted when  the hi -
rail vehicle trackside  was sighted . 
4.3.12.  Currently, KiwiRail's periodic medical screening programme requires health assessment s of 
staff in safety -critical roles  every five years up to the  age of 50 , every two  years up to the age of 
60, and annually thereafter.  The programme consists of an online health questionnaire , to be 
completed  by an employee before a visit to a KiwiRail -approved medical officer for a physical 
examination.  
4.3.13.  The Austra lian National Transport Commission's  national standard for health assessment of rail 
safety workers has been adopted by the New Zealand National Rail Safety Standards Executive, 
and is therefore utilised  by KiwiRail .  The standard has been developed from r oading standards 
in Australia, and is formally reviewed every four years.  
 www.ntc.gov.au/Media/Reports/(7B079897 -1863 -CA93 -474F -AD96AD9C6C3F).pdf  
4.3.14.  Section 18.6 of the standard deals with sleeping disorders and contains a flowchart for the 
assessment of sa fety-critical workers  (see Figure 13).   Following this flowchart, t he driver in this 
case score d low  both on the  Epworth Sleepiness Scale14 and for their  clinical markers  such as 
                                                        
14 A scale  that measure s awake -time  sleepiness  throu gh the use of a very short questionnaire. This can be 
helpful in diagnosing  sleep disorders . It was introduced in 1991 by Dr Murray Johns of  Epworth Hospital  in 
Melbourne, Australia . 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -101 BMI and blood pressure ; therefore they did not exceed the threshold for referr al for a follow -up 
sleep study.   As part of the continuous improvement cycle of the standard there are already 
discussion documents out for consultation with regards to potential changes to tighten the 
standard .  Many of these proposed changes would likely  have indicated  that this driver required 
a follow -up sleep study.

of rail safety critical workers  
4.3.15.  In this case the driver  reported that s omeone else  had completed the online medical 
questionnaire part of the medical assessment for the driver , before the health assessment .  It is 
not clear as to  why that happened , but it was a clear departure from the KiwiRail procedure, 
and of concern.   It is an indication that the importance and safety benefits of the medical 
assessment program me were not fully realised by those involved.   

 
Final Report RO -2017 -101 
<< Page 17 >>
 4.3.16.  Current ly, part of the KiwiRail  pre-medical online  question naire  completed by each individual 
utilises  the Epworth Slee piness Scale set of questions  to assess the sleepiness of the individual  
as an initial screening test for sleeping disorders .  Respondents are asked to rate their usual 
chances of dozing off or falling asleep whilst engaging in eight different activities . 
4.3.17.  KiwiRail acknowledge d that the screening tests for sleeping disorders have relatively low validity 
in clinical trials  (Satya Krishna Ramachandran MD, 2009) .  Consequently , KiwiRail's rail 
medical officers15 put more weight on th e clinical indications of sleeping disorders , such  as BMI 
and high blood pressure  referred to above . 
4.3.18.  Notwithstanding the fact that the driver did not  personally complete the pre-medical 
questionnaire, w hen the driver  did complete it after the incident , the score was not high enough 
on the sleepiness scale  to warrant any follow -up under the sleeping disorder medical 
assessment procedure  alone .   
4.3.19.  Subsequent to the incident and the diagnosis of sleep apnoea , the driver  has been provided 
with aids to reduce the  effects of sleep apnoea and made  a number of other lifestyle changes 
to improve quality of sleep, with reported good results.  This shows the importance of early 
detection of sleep disorders and the importance of education on lifestyle s for shift workers .  The 
Commission makes a recommendation to KiwiRail to ensure that the periodic medical check 
system captures data directly from the intended subject s. 
4.4. Fatigue management  
Safety issue - KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk management system to ensur e that 
relevant personnel perform ed at adequate levels of alertness.  
4.4.1.  In section 1 of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures , rail personnel are 
deemed unfit for duty if they:  
i. are under the influence of alcohol or drugs  
ii. have any illness or cond ition, mental or physical, which affects alertness, 
coordination, reaction or safety  
iii. have not sufficiently rested to remain alert during their work . 
4.4.2.  As with most operators of transport vehicles,  train driver s are required to self-certif y whether 
they are ' fit for duty'  before attending their allocated shift s.  Due to issues on a national scale 
associated with earthquakes that KiwiRail was dealing with at the time , the driver felt self-
pressure d to attend work, despite having had a poor night 's sleep .  The d river was also 
concerned that call ing in unfit for work would leave little time to arrange a replacement driver to 
cover the shift.  
4.4.3.  Currently KiwiRail use s a FAID software system to assess its master rosters for potential fatigue 
issues and also for post -incident analysis.  This type of software aims to ensure  that each roster 
position gives the individual ample opportunity to sleep between shifts, and that the roster is 
compiled according to current good roster design princ iples , which include providing cover 
drivers16.  The driver's roster was considered normal and was not a factor in this incident.  
4.4.4.  A number of other safety -critical transport sectors have introduced simple checklists or prompts 
(CAA, 2018)  as part of their fatigue awareness  training and education, to assist individuals in 
determin ing if  they are fit for duty (see Figure 1 4).

assessments of employees and prospective employees in a specific locale.

shift.

Example fitness -for-work prompt sheet  
4.4.5.  On the day of the incident the cover driver planned for the KiwiR ail Kawerau roster had already 
been assigned to cover another driver.  Other drivers who were not rostered to work on this day 
may have been able to cover the shift, but may not have been  adjusted to a night -shift work 
pattern . 
4.4.6.  In November 2016 KiwiRail he ld fatigue management w orkshops with the Rail and Maritime 
Transport Union and Professor Philippa Gander from the Sleep/Wake Research Centre at 
Massey University Wellington.  As part of th ese workshop s a new regulatory approach in the 
form of a  fatigue risk management system (Medicine, 2012)  was identified as the next step in 
fatigue management at  KiwiRail.  T his is a data -driven safety management syst em that is based 
on combined scientific and operational expertise and includes  processes for monitoring safety 
performance and continuous improvement.  A fatigue risk management system i s made up of 
four parts:  
i. organisational components  
 fatigue risk management policy and documentation  
 fatigue risk management promotional processes - education and training  
ii. operational components  
 fatigue risk management processes  
 fatigue risk management safety assurance processes . 
4.4.7.  KiwiRail currently ha s a draft fatigue risk management system  policy for locomotive engineer s 
and train controller s, plus a number of existing processes and systems that fit within a fatigue 
risk management system .  KiwiRail has used gap analysis to identify missing parts from  its 
existing fatigue management system s and assigned  actions to address these shortfalls.   While 
some of these missing parts have been addressed , others are still work s in progress.  
4.4.8.  Driving trains is a safety -critical role .  Additional guidance and training may have helped the 
driver  to evaluate their  condition better before attending the shift.  
4.4.9.  The Commis sion makes a recommendation to KiwiRail to ensure  that a comprehensive fatigue 
risk management system continues to be  developed and fully implemented within the 
organisation.  
4.5. Technical factors  
Safety issue - The eProtect KMC module on the locomotive  had been transmitting  error 
messages  for three weeks before the incident , but the activity database was not being  
monitor ed for this type of error . 
4.5.1.  An interrogati on of the eProtect activity database logs  from KiwiRail  showed  that the KMC 
module on board the inci dent locomotive had started to send self-generated error messages 

 
Final Report RO -2017 -101 
<< Page 19 >>
 from  16 January 2017, three weeks before the incident.  The error messages indicated that the 
KMC module was capable of receiv ing worksite positions from Train Control , but it was unable 
to write the m to memory.   This meant the KMC module had no worksite details with which to  
compare the train 's current GPS position and could not take action when the train passed the 
compulsory stop board s. 
4.5.2.  The Commission obtained the eProtect KMC module from  the locomotive involved in the  
incident.  The module was forensic ally examin ed with assistance provided by  the KMC module 
manufacturer.  The module was the processor of the eProtect system on board the locomotive .  
It receive d details of rail worksite loc ations around New Zealand using the mobile phone 
network, and compare d them to the real -time GPS position s of the locomotive.  As mentioned 
previously, t he KMC module was designed to alert driver s when the ir locomotive s were  
approaching known worksite loca tions, and if necessary  take action should the train s approach 
the worksite s too fast or fail to stop at compulsory stop boards.  
4.5.3.  The examination of the KMC module identified a  hardware fault , which was traced to a failed 
integrated circuit chip.  The integ rated circuit chip was  used  by the KMC module to switch its 
memory power  source  from the external 12 -volt supply to an internal battery backup whenever 
the locomotive was powered down .   
4.5.4.  It was not possible to determine why the chip failed .  The design and  manufacturing 
specifications did not indicate a lifecycle for this type of integrated circuit chip.  However, 
irrespective  of why the chip  and subsequently the  KMC module failed, the issue is that  the 
module had reported the error to the eProtect activity  log database , but the monitoring  process 
had not pick ed up the error message .   
4.5.5.  Without the ability to write the location of the worksite  at Bridge 107 to its memory, the KMC 
module was not aware of its existence.  Thus the data for the location of the co mpulsory stop 
boards  was missing, and that is why the eProtect system  failed to apply the train brakes when 
the train did not stop at the boards.  
4.5.6.  During the development of the eProtect system, the KMC module was programmed to send 
messages back to the ePro tect activity log database , which  in turn notified  four different 
addressees at KiwiRail by email when certain conditions occurred.  These conditions included a 
variety of faults and errors, including GPS faults and communication errors .  However , the 
particular mode of failure that occu rred in this instance had not been envisaged, so the system 
was not programmed to generate an  email alert to KiwiRail staff . 
4.5.7.  The lack of  an email or other warning message being generated by the eProtect system  meant  
the KMC module was sending error messages to the eProtect activity log database , alerting that 
it could not write the worksite GPS details into its on -board memory .  However , these error 
messages were not identified  or acted on because  the eProtect activity databa se was not 
actively monitored by KiwiRail for this type of occurrence .   
4.5.8.  The specification, development, tria lling and rollout of the eProtect system by KiwiRail and its 
contractors were  comprehensive .  From the r ecords detailing the system requirements, 
development and testing that were provided to the Commission , it is apparent that not all the 
modes of failure of the KMC module or the eProtect system were fully understood and planned 
for before the system was put into service .  No failure mode analysis had been undertaken on 
the system , and this specif ic mode of failure  was not being monitored .  The Commission has 
made a recommendation on this issue in report RO2017 -102.  
4.5.9.  When the eProtect system works  correctly it greatly enhances  safety  around protected 
worksites .  Although the eProtect system is considered a n additional  safety  defence against 
trains inadvertently entering worksite s without authorisation, its function is important , 
particularly when the primary defence is reliant on human fact ors. 
4.5.10.  KiwiRai l has made technical changes to the eProtect system to address t his safety issue ; see 
section 6.  

<< Page 20 >>
 Final Report RO -2017 -101 5. Findings  
5.1. The safety of the people at the worksite and on the train  was compromised when the driver did 
not see the outer warning and compulsory stop boards and  made an unauthorised entry to the 
worksite . 
5.2. The reason for the driver not see ing the outer warning and compulsory stop boards was that the 
driver was likely experiencing microsleeps at the time.  
5.3. The driver was very likely susceptible to experiencing micro sleeps due to a combination of the 
following factors:  
 the driver suffered from mild obstructive sleep apnoea, which was affecting the quality 
of sleep  
 the driver  had experienced a poor night's sleep before beginning the night shift , due to 
the hot ambient temperature  
 the driver  had been awake for more than  10 hours and was nearing the end of a 10½ -
hour night shift.  
5.4. The safety benefits derived from the KiwiRail safety -critical worker health assessment were not 
fully realised by those involved, and as a resul t the driver 's sleep apnoea had gone  undetected.  
5.5. KiwiRail has a draft fatigue risk management system policy  that is still under development. Had 
the current system been able to provide a dditional guidance to driver s, it may have helped them  
to evaluate their condition better before attending shift s.  
5.6. The eProtect system was a safety  defence for preventing trains inadvertently entering worksite s 
without authorisation.  The system did not work on this occasion because a technical error in 
the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected and rectified by KiwiRail 
staff.  
5.7. The error in the processing unit on board the locomotive had not been detected because the 
eProtect system had not been subjected to a full failure mode analysis before being pu t into

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified du ring an inquiry  
6.2. In response to the incident KiwiRail has introduced a proactive 'polling' system that interrogates 
the event log on each locomotive every two hours and highlights any locomotives that have 
logged more than 10 error events in that  two-hour  period .  An email is then generated for any 
such locomotives, which are then  flagged as 'Not To Run' until the fault has been investigated  
and resolved at a maintenance facility . 
6.3. Since 2016 Kiwi Rail has had a Fatigue Safety Action Group to establish and run  a fatigue risk 
management system and its integration with the other parts of the organisation.

 Final Report RO -2017 -101 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate t o address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case recommendation s have been issued to KiwiRail  with notice of these 
recommendations give n to the NZ Transport Agency . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendations  made to KiwiRail   
7.3. The KiwiR ail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee being assessed 
completed the online medical questionnaire themselves.  There is some evidence that the 
system could potentially allow managers or others to complete the questionnaire on the 
employees ' behalf.  
On 23 August 2018  the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail  improve 
the health assessment syste m to ensure  that the periodic medical check system capture s data 
directly from the subject . (018/18)  
On 26 September 2018 , KiwiRail replied:  
Medical Assessment Process  
KiwiRail accepts that there exists the possibility that someone could complete the 
periodic health assessment online medical questionnaire on behalf of the intended 
subject, and will now work towards implement ing changes which will eliminate this 
possibility.  
7.4. Curren tly KiwiRail do es not have a fully developed , comprehensive fatigue risk management 
system to ensure that all relevant personnel perform at adequate levels of awareness.    
On 23 August 2018  the Commi ssion recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure  
that a comprehensive fatigue risk management system is fully developed and implemented 
within the organisation.   (019/18)  
On 26 September 2018 , KiwiRail replied:  
Fatigue Risk Management System  
KiwiRail presently has two streams of work in progress which are addressing fatigue 
risk management.  There is a review of the enterprise wide fatigue policy that 
includes a wider organisational focus on occupational health and wellbeing related 
fatigue.  T his includes physical fatigue, mental fatigue and sleep fatigue risk.  
Secondly and concurrently with this, the respective business units are addressing 
specific fatigue risk management initiatives and providing educational information 
on how to best manag e risks occurring from fatigue.  
The fatigue risk  management strategy program is a joint KiwiRail and Rail & Maritime 
Transport Union project delivered through the High Performance High Engagement 
program.  A fatigue risk management strategy is currently un der development for 
train drivers/train controllers, and eventually will be introduced across the business.  
Notice given to Regulator  
7.5. On 23 August 2018  the Commission gave notice  to the Chief Executive of  the NZ Transport 
Agency that the Commission had recommended that :  
The Chief Executive of KiwiRail  improve the health assessment system to ensure that the 
periodic medical check system captures data directly from the subject .

appropriate lifestyle choices that will enhance the amount and quality of their sleep, in order to 
avoid being fatigued or tired while at work .  
8.2. Transport operators must ensure  that their staff are fu lly educated on the factors that can 
cause or contribute to their becoming tired or fatigued while performing safety -critical roles.  
8.3. Technological systems need to be fully te sted and have undergone full failure mode analysis if 
they are going to be relied on as a safety defence  for preventing accidents and incidents.
