  3.1. Since taking  delivery of the San Granit  the operator had carried out a series\
  \ of safety \nassessments to try to identify  any safety measures or guarding solutions\
  \  required to \nreduce the risks associated with factory operations .  Difficulties\
  \  in fitting interlocked \nguarding meant that safety measures focused largely\
  \ on administrative controls, which \nrelied  on operators following procedures\
  \ and instructions.  \n3.2. The freezerman was working alone in the early hours\
  \ of the morning.  There  were no \nwitnesses to the accident  and there was no\
  \ closed -circuit -television  monitoring in the \narea.  Therefore the reason for\
  \ the freezerman entering the guarded area could not be \ndetermined , but it may\
  \ have been to clear a jammed box of fish.  \n3.3. The following analysis considers\
  \ the actions and preconditions that likely led to this \naccident  occurring and\
  \ the  safety measures in place at the time of the accident .  It also \ndiscusses\
  \ the following two safety issue s: \n\uF0B7 the risks associated with operating\
  \ the accumulator were not fully understood  and the \nsafety controls relied heavily\
  \ on the  machine  operator following generic instructions \nand procedures  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the training in place for the crew around the configuration of the emergency stops\
  \  \nlikely resulted in con fusion on which emergency stops serviced  which system.\
  \  \nWhat happened  \n3.4. The freezerman had been trained and signed off to work\
  \ in the freezer area;  this included \nbeing  permitted to enter the guarded  area\
  \ when required.   \n3.5. The freezerman was found  trapped in a position that showed\
  \ it was very likely they were  \nreaching into the accumulator  when the accident\
  \ occurred .  It is  about as likely as not  \nthat the freezerman reached into\
  \ the accumulator attempting to  clear a box of frozen \nproduct that had become\
  \ misaligned.   \n3.6. The accumulator was found to have been operating in automatic\
  \ mode  at the time of the \naccident.  In this mode, when the hydraulic ram that\
  \ raised and lowered the floor of the \naccumulator was activated, the attached\
  \ framework (see Figure 9) would lower.  It was \ntherefore likely that the hydraulic\
  \ ram was activated by the fr eezerman triggering a \nsensor. This then lowered\
  \ the attached framework and trapped the freezerman between \nthe static and moveable\
  \ sections of the framework.   \n3.7. It is not known which route the freezerman\
  \ took when approaching the accumulator.   \nThe safest rout e was from the weighing\
  \ and packing station (see Figure 10), entering \nthrough the gate after switching\
  \ off the power to the accumulator located on the touch \nscreen at the weighing\
  \ and packing  station.  However, depending on the freezerman 's \nlocation at the\
  \  time of the box jam, there were faster but less safe alternative routes to \n\
  enter the guarded area. These routes would not have taken the freezerman past the\
  \ \ncontrols  that isolate d the machinery.  \n3.8. The investigation was unable\
  \ to determine why the freezerman  did not follow the basic \nsafety rules before\
  \ reaching into the accumulator , but it is about as likely as not that the \n \n\
  Final Report MO -2018 -205 \n<< Page 15 >>\n freezerman's decision -making abilities\
  \ were adversely affected by some form of \nimpairment.  \n \nFigure 9: View of\
  \ the accumulator showing the area where the freezerman was entrapped  \ngap created\

  \  \n(indicated by purple arrows)  \nFactory safety measures  \n3.9. Prior to the\
  \ San Granit  becoming fully operational , three safety  assessments had been  \n\
  undertaken to assist the risk assessment  process in respect of machinery , guarding\
  \ and \nsafe operating procedure s for the equipment fitted in the factory .  \n\
  3.10. The accumulator had been  identified as posing an injury risk  at a nip point\
  \ between two \nconveyor belts.  It had been  decided to include the accumulator\
  \  within  the automatic \nplate freezer guard ed area  rather than install a separate\
  \ guard cover over the top of it .  \nGuarding around the automatic plate freezers\
  \ , including the accumulator , had been  \ninstalled at the end of the shakedown\
  \ trip, but other safety measures for th e area had \nnot been finalised.  The subsequent\
  \ report had stated:  \nThe stacker sliding door guarding  system that encompasses\
  \ the automated \nfreezer operation has been completed, there are a dozen locks\
  \ fitted to doors to \nprevent any unauthorised entry, two keys can open the completed\
  \ set.  A SOP  \n[safe operating procedure]  is currently being developed, the \
  \ responsibilities of \nthe keys will be clearly outlined, eg: on who has access.\
  \  A new risk assessment \nhas been completed there are multiple hazards with in\
  \ this operation  [sic].  In \nregard to the exposure of entanglement, crush and\
  \ shearing type injuries w ith the \ngates locked the risk has been lowered to a\
  \ M8 [moderate 8], the installation of \nan interlock system would reduce the likelihood\
  \ to low.  \n3.11. When the San Granit  had become operational in January 2017,\
  \ there were several safety \noperations  that could only be reviewed and developed\
  \ by observing the performance of \nthe crew and the factory machinery at sea. \
  \  Throughout 2017 the safety measures  \nalready taken  had been  monitored  and\
  \ various issues had been  discussed at the  on-\nboard EH&S  meetings .  An examination\
  \ of the minutes  from the se meeting s showed that \nthere had been ongoing discussion\
  \ s about  balanc ing safety measures with operational \npracticality and efficiency.\
  \  A fourth  safety assessment , carried out in December 2017, \nhad been  aimed\
  \ at determining the effectiveness of the new guardi ng and resolv ing \ngate to\
  \ access guarded \narea \ncontrol screens and \nemergency stops \nlocated at the\
  \ weighing \nforward  \n \nFinal Report MO -2018 -205 \n<< Page 17 >>\n ongoing\
  \ issues with its functionality .  The safety assessment report had stated that\
  \ the \noperator may  wish to have interlocks fitted  to the automatic plate freezers\
  \ ' guarding \nsystem as recomme nded the previous  year.  However,  there had been\
  \  operationa l issues  \nthat made fitting interlocks impractical (see 2.13). \
  \   \n3.12. It was in June 2018 that a solution  had been  found , the automatic\
  \ plate freezer  guarding \nissues had been removed from the EH&S meetings  and\
  \ the system improvement notice  \nhad been closed .  The solution had been  to\
  \ move the automatic plate freezer controls  \noutside the guarded area, thereby\
  \ eliminating  the need for a person to enter  the area to \noperate  the controls\
  \ .  This in effect had reduced the likelihood of an incident occurring. \nHowever,\
  \ if a n authorised  person had decide d to enter the area without making the \n\
  machinery safe before entering , the same hazards would have been  still present.\
  \  \n3.13. At the time of the accident, the gate between the weighing and packing\
  \ station and the \nback of the accumulator was not fitted with an interlock . Therefore\
  \ it was possible for  the \nfreezerman to pass through th e gate and enter the\
  \ ring -fenced area  without the \nmachinery shutting down automatically.   \n3.14.\
  \ The hazards posed by the verti cal movement of the accumulator  floor and associated\
  \ \nframework  had not been identified and assessed.  Several crew members  who\
  \ were \ninterviewed  recognised that the accumulat or had always to be switched\
  \ off by using the \nemergency stop and switching to manual mode before attempting\
  \ to clear a jammed \nbox.   \n3.15. It had been noted in EH&S meetings that there\
  \ was confusion surrounding the \nemergency stops in the factory , particularly\
  \  on which emergency stops serviced which \nsystem , due to their not being properly\
  \ labelled .  The investigation found that only the \nemergency stop on the operator's\
  \ touch screen  and the emergency stop  button on the \nside of the touch screen\
  \  (see Figure 6) cut the power to the accumulator .    \n3.16. Post-accident recovery\
  \ a ctions  required the operation of the accumulator , and as a  result  \nthe\
  \ status of the emergency stops at the time of the ac cident could not be determined\
  \ .  \nAttempts to recreate the accident scenar io showed it was very likely that\
  \ the freezerman \ndid not  operate the accumulator  emergency stop . This recreation\
  \ , together with \ninterviews conducted in the course of the investig ation, identified\
  \ some confusion \namong crew on which emergency stop serviced which system. The\
  \ investigation found , \nthrough interviews with the crew  and the recreation \
  \ of the accident , that the  confusion \nidentified  in the EH&S meetings  was\
  \ likely the result of poor awareness  of the \nemergency stop configuration that\
  \ had been passed on through training .  While it was \nunlikely that this issue\
  \ contributed to the accident, crew could potentially  access running \nmachinery\
  \ after pressing  an incorrect emergency stop. \n3.17. From the time that the San\
  \ Granit  had become operational to the time of the  accident , \nthe hazards presented\
  \ by the automatic plate freezer system had been  a focus of  \nattention . The\
  \ risks associated with the accumulator had been overlooked , and as a result  \n\
  there had been  no machine -specific instructions for its safe use.   \n3.18. Had\
  \ a  separate risk assessment and task analysis been carried out specifically for\
  \ the \naccumulator , it may have provided the operator with a more thorough understanding\
  \ of \nthe risks and hazards  likely to be encountered .  It would also have p rovided\
  \ an \nopportunity to identify practicable engineering controls to reduce the risks\
  \ (see Figure 8).  \nOnce inside the guarded area, t he only safety controls  available\
  \ to the operator of the \n \n \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -205 accumulator\
  \ were basic training in machine safety and an area -specific safe operating \n\
  procedure .     \n3.19. On this occasion , had the freezerman followed the procedure\
  \ for clearing a blockage in \nthe automatic plate freezer area (see Appendix 1)\
  \ that incorporated the accumulator, it is \nvery likely that the  accident would\
  \ not have occurred.   \n3.20. Similarly, had the advice from the earlier safety\
  \ assessments been heeded and interlocks \nfitted  at access points to the guarded\
  \ area, the risk could have been minimised and not \nbeen reliant on administrative\
  \ controls al one.  A ll the machinery would have been shut \ndown when the freezerman\
  \  entered the guarded a rea and the accident would not have \noccurred.  \n3.21.\
  \ Since the accident the operator has taken action to address the safety issues\
  \ associated \nwith the automatic plate freez er and accumulator area (see section\
  \ 5.6).  As a result , the \nCommission does not intend to make a recommendation.\
  \  \nFitness for duty  \n3.22. The Health and Safety at Work Act includes a person's\
  \ behaviour as a hazard \"where that \nbehaviour has the potential to cause  death,\
  \ injury, or illness to a person (whether or not \nthat behaviour results from physical\
  \ or mental fatigue, drugs, alcohol, traumatic shock or \nanother temporary condition\
  \ that affects a person's behaviour )\"4. \n3.23. The use of performance -impairing\
  \ substances by an individ ual operating complex \nmachinery  is a risk to that\
  \ individual and anyone reliant on the correct functioning of that \nmachinery .\
  \ \n3.24. There are several factors that can lead to impair ment .  In the case\
  \ of this accident , the \npositive result of the free zerman's toxicology test\
  \ for the presence of methamphetamine  \nwas a source of potential impairment .\
  \  The Commission sought an expert's opinion on \nthe possible role of methamphetamine\
  \ consumption and its contribution to the \naccident5.  Parts of t he resulting\
  \ report are summarised in  paragraphs 3.25 to 3.27. \n3.25. Methamphetamine can\
  \ be  eliminated from the body within one to three days , which is  a \nrelatively\
  \ shor t space of time .  It is exceptionally unlikely that the methamphetamine\
  \ was \nconsumed before t he commencement of the voyage two weeks before the accident.\
  \  \n3.26. Methamphetamine consumption has a non -linear and inconsistent effect\
  \ on the body in \nrelation to intoxication  and impairment.  A  dose that may enhance\
  \ performance in one \nperson can be an overdose for another person. The eff ects\
  \ in general are complex and \nwide  ranging; many remain open to legitimate scientific\
  \ inquiry and debate.  Many of the \neffects seen in a person who has consumed methamphetamine\
  \ will also be seen in a \nperson who is undergoing severe psychological stress\
  \ and anxiety.   Research into \nmethamphetamine use amongst drivers has shown \
  \ that in some cases the dru g can be a \nperformance enhancer, but  there remain\
  \ s an increase in risky behaviour such as \nspeeding and departure from the lane\
  \ o f travel6. \n                                                        \n4 Health\
  \ and Safety at Work Act 2015, section 16.  \n5 Professor Johan DuFlou, Consulting\

  \ level indicated that it was virtually certain the drug had \nbeen consumed whilst\
  \ at sea. The psychoactive effects of the drug  can last from six to \ntwelve hours\
  \ , but b ecause it is not known when or how it was  administered  it is about as\
  \ \nlikely as not that the psychoactive effects had dissipated, yet it remained\
  \ readily \ndetectable in blood.   The expert was unable to conclude with certainty\
  \ whether the \nmethamphetamine use contributed to the circumstances leading up\
  \ to the ac cident.  \nHowever, the combined effects of drug use , shift work and\
  \ possible fatigue on a n \nessentially  unsupervised factory operator  very likely\
  \ increased  the risk of an accident  \noccurring . \n3.28. The operator's drug\
  \ and alcohol policy testing regime  (see paragraph 2.35) was over and \nabove that\
  \ described by industry guidelines ; nevertheless , it was still possible for crew\
  \ \nmembers  to elude detection .  Substance s such as methamphetamine, which are\
  \ cleared \nfrom the body in a matter of days, c ould be taken by c rew members\
  \ while the vessel  was \nat sea without the risk of  detec tion by random testing\
  \ .  \n3.29. As part of the operator's safety induction training, crew were required\
  \ to watch a video \nabout the dangers of alcohol and drug use in the workplace.\
  \  The video was in formative \nand confronting.  However, this accident shows that\
  \ education and a testing regime are \nstill not deterring some crew members from\
  \ taking illicit drugs at sea.   \n3.30. Maritime New Zealand has taken a joint\
  \ approach with fishing industry leaders to \nincre ase awareness of the adverse\
  \ effects of stress, fatigue and drug and alcohol use at \nsea.  Recent and continuing\
  \ educational campaigns have focused on these issues and \nprovided operators with\
  \ guidance on which to base their policies and training \nprogrammes7.  Appendix\
  \ 3 has a copy of a collaborative information brochure called \n'Dealing with drugs\
  \ '.  A survey on the subject of drug and alcohol use has shown that the \nself-reported\
  \ use of alcohol and other drugs in the fishing industry is consistent with use\
  \ \nin the general population of New Zealand.  These figures are also consistent\
  \ with non -\nnegative test results in the New Zealand fishing industry.  \n3.31.\
  \ The c onsumption of alcohol and the use of other performance -impairing substances\
  \ \nhave been a recurring contributo ry factor  in injuries and deaths in all transport\
  \ modes  \nand have  been on the Commission 's Watchlist  for a number of years.\
  \  Although the risk \nof this type of accident recurring is considered to be low,\
  \  the ongoing work being carried \nout by Maritime New Zealand  and the industry\
  \ on drug awareness issues within the \nfishing industry supports the health and\
  \ safety legislation , which aims to keep  risk as low \nas reasonably practicable\
  \ .   \nFatigue  and stress  \n3.32. The operator recognised  that shift work is\
  \ known to contribute to fatigue and  that in \nturn fatigue and stress are risks\
  \ to the health and safety of sea -going crews.  The  \nIntroduction to Safety On\
  \ -board handbook encourage d crew to take  as much rest as \npossible, eat well\
  \ and try t o stay warm and dry.  It stated, \"Fatigue affects your strength, \n\
  your coordination and your judgement and makes you more likely to have an accident\
  \ .\"  \nThe handbook  encouraged crew members to try to g et as much sleep as possible\
  \ during \ntheir off -duty hours and to take breaks and stay well  hydrated to minimise\
  \ the effects of \nfatigue.    \n                                              \

  \  \n \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>\n Final Report MO -2018 -205 3.33. Sanford  also had\
  \ a  Fatigue Management Procedure , which placed  the responsibility on \nthe master\
  \  to identify fatigue in members of the crew.  The information  provided in the\
  \ \nFatigue Management Procedure followed the advice outlined in Maritime New Zealand\
  \ 's \nguidance  (see Appendix 2)  on how to develop a fatigue management plan and\
  \ how to \ndetect  the effects of fatigue on a seafarer.  Although tiredness was\
  \ an accepted risk \nassoci ated with working in the factory, the factory manager\
  \ was known to ask the crew \non each shift if there were any fatigue or tiredness\
  \ issues.  \n3.34. The factory crew worked in shifts of six hours on and six hours\
  \ off.  The shift pattern was \nchosen by the operator to enable  the factory to\
  \ operate 24 hours a day while minimis ing \nthe effects of fatigue.  Although t\
  \ he activities of the freezerman during off-duty hours \nare unknown,  the consumption\
  \ of illicit drugs in a shipboard environment with a shift \npattern in place  raises\
  \ the risk of a fatigue -related accident.  The use of a stimulant drug \nsuch as\
  \ methamphetamine may have provided a short -term reprieve from tiredness, but \n\
  as the stimulant effects wore off, tiredness and fatigue would have been  exacerbated.\
