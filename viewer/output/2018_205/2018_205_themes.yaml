- name: Lack of Specific Risk Assessments and Safe Operating Procedures
  explanation: The absence of a specific risk assessment and safe operating procedure for the accumulator is a significant safety theme in this accident. The report states that "the accumulator did not have its own risk assessment or safe operating procedure, and therefore the risk of an operator becoming trapped in the framework while it was operational had not been identified" (4.3). This lack of specific safety measures meant that the risks associated with the accumulator were not fully understood, and the safety controls relied heavily on the machine operator following generic instructions and procedures (3.3). The failure to identify and assess the hazards posed by the vertical movement of the accumulator floor and associated framework contributed to the accident (3.14).
- name: Inadequate Guarding and Interlock Systems
  explanation: Inadequate guarding and interlock systems are another safety theme related to this accident. The report indicates that the gate between the weighing and packing station and the back of the accumulator was not fitted with an interlock, allowing the freezerman to enter the ring-fenced area without the machinery shutting down automatically (3.13). Furthermore, the report suggests that "had the advice from the earlier safety assessments been heeded and interlocks fitted at access points to the guarded area, the risk could have been minimised and not been reliant on administrative controls alone" (3.20). This highlights the importance of physical safety barriers and automated systems to prevent access to hazardous areas.
- name: Reliance on Administrative Controls Over Engineering Controls
  explanation: The reliance on administrative controls over engineering controls is a critical safety theme in this accident. The report discusses that due to operational issues, fitting interlocks was impractical, leading to a focus on administrative controls such as procedures and instructions (3.10, 3.11). However, these controls depend on operators following procedures, which can be less reliable than engineering controls like physical guards or interlocks (3.1). The report emphasizes that "once inside the guarded area, the only safety controls available to the operator of the accumulator were basic training in machine safety and an area-specific safe operating procedure" (3.18 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), underscoring the vulnerability of relying on administrative controls.
- name: Training and Confusion Around Emergency Stops
  explanation: Training and confusion around emergency stops are directly related to the safety of the operation and are a theme in this accident. The report notes that there was confusion among the crew regarding which emergency stops serviced which system, and this confusion was likely the result of poor awareness passed on through training (3.15, 3.16). Although it was unlikely that this issue contributed directly to the accident, it indicates a potential risk where crew could access running machinery after pressing an incorrect emergency stop (3.16).
- name: Impairment and Fitness for Duty
  explanation: Impairment and fitness for duty are significant safety themes in this accident. The freezerman's decision-making abilities were likely adversely affected by some form of impairment, which could have been due to the presence of methamphetamine in their system (3.8, 3.24). The report states that "the combined effects of drug use, shift work and possible fatigue on an essentially unsupervised factory operator very likely increased the risk of an accident occurring" (3.27). This theme highlights the importance of ensuring that all personnel are fit for duty, especially when operating complex machinery.
- name: Fatigue and Shift Work
  explanation: Fatigue and shift work are recognized as factors that can compromise safety and are relevant to this accident. The operator acknowledged that shift work contributes to fatigue, which in turn is a risk to health and safety (3.32). The report also mentions that the freezerman was working alone in the early hours of the morning, a time when human performance can be adversely affected (3.2, 3.34). The consumption of stimulant drugs in a shift work environment could temporarily mask tiredness but ultimately exacerbate fatigue, increasing the risk of an accident (3.34).
