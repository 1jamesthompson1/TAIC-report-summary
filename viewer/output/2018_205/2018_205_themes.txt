Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate safety measures: The report highlights that the safety measures in place relied heavily on administrative controls and operator compliance, rather than engineering controls. The guarding solutions were difficult to fit, resulting in a lack of interlocked guarding and inadequate labeling of emergency stops. This led to increased risks and confusion among the crew.

2. Lack of risk assessment: The accumulator, which posed an injury risk, did not have its own risk assessment or safe operating procedure. The hazards associated with the vertical movement of the accumulator floor and framework were not identified and assessed. This lack of risk assessment contributed to the accident and the absence of machine-specific instructions for safe use.

3. Impairment and fitness for duty: The report suggests that the freezerman's decision-making abilities may have been adversely affected by some form of impairment, specifically the presence of methamphetamine in their system. The consumption of performance-impairing substances, combined with shift work and possible fatigue, increased the risk of an accident occurring. The operator's drug and alcohol policy did not effectively deter crew members from using illicit drugs at sea.

4. Fatigue and stress: The shift pattern of six hours on and six hours off, combined with lone working in the early hours of the morning, raised the risk of fatigue-related accidents. The report acknowledges that fatigue and stress are risks to the health and safety of sea-going crews, and the use of stimulant drugs like methamphetamine may exacerbate fatigue after the initial stimulant effects wear off.

5. Inadequate training and awareness: There was confusion among the crew regarding the configuration and labeling of emergency stops, which had been identified in EH&S meetings. The investigation found that poor awareness of the emergency stop configuration had been passed on through training. This lack of training and awareness contributed to the confusion and potential access to running machinery after pressing an incorrect emergency stop.

6. Inadequate drug and alcohol testing regime: The operator's drug and alcohol policy testing regime, although over and above industry guidelines, still allowed crew members to elude detection. The short elimination period of substances like methamphetamine made it possible for crew members to consume drugs at sea without the risk of detection by random testing. The report suggests that education and testing regimes are not effectively deterring crew members from taking illicit drugs at sea.
