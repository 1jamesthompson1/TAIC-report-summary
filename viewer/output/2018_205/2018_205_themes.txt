Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Inadequate safety measures: The report highlights that the safety measures in place relied heavily on administrative controls and operator compliance, rather than engineering controls. The guarding solutions were difficult to fit, resulting in a lack of interlocked guarding and inadequate labeling of emergency stops. This led to increased risks and confusion among the crew.

2. Lack of risk assessment: The accumulator, which posed an injury risk, did not have its own risk assessment or safe operating procedure. The hazards associated with the vertical movement of the accumulator floor and framework were not identified and assessed. This lack of risk assessment contributed to the accident.

3. Impairment and fitness for duty: The report suggests that the freezerman's decision-making abilities may have been adversely affected by some form of impairment, potentially due to the consumption of methamphetamine. The use of performance-impairing substances and the risk of fatigue were identified as hazards to the correct functioning of the machinery and the safety of the crew.

4. Inadequate drug and alcohol policy: The operator's drug and alcohol policy, although over and above industry guidelines, did not effectively deter crew members from using illicit drugs at sea. The testing regime was not able to detect substances like methamphetamine, which can be cleared from the body in a matter of days.

5. Fatigue and stress: The shift pattern of six hours on and six hours off, combined with the potential consumption of stimulant drugs, raised the risk of fatigue-related accidents. The report highlights the importance of fatigue management and the need for crew members to be aware of the effects of fatigue on their performance and judgment.

6. Lack of communication and training: There was confusion among the crew regarding the emergency stops and their configuration. The investigation found that poor awareness of the emergency stop configuration had been passed on through training. This lack of communication and training contributed to the confusion and potential access to running machinery after pressing an incorrect emergency stop.
