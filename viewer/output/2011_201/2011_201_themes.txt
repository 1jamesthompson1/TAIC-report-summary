The causes of the accident outlined in the accident investigation report are as follows:

1. The design of the SPTDL-150P lifeboat davit does not allow for thorough examination or effective lubrication of the wire falls where they pass around the fixed guides. Lack of proper lubrication can lead to rapid corrosion and possible premature failure of the wire rope.

2. The design of the SPTDL-150P davit allows the outer ends of the fixed arm to flex towards the adjacent moving trolley beam when the load is taken by the wire falls, causing the trolley beam structure to contact the wire guides and possibly the wire falls. This can result in excessive wear and premature failure of the wire rope.

Given these causes, the following recommendations have been made:

1. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should alert all owners of vessels fitted with the SPTDL-150P stored-power telescopic lifeboat davits about the accident and provide instructions for immediate inspections and maintenance to prevent wire rope failures.
  
2. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should conduct a technical assessment of other lifeboat davit models it has produced to identify similar safety issues and alert owners of those davits to take necessary inspections and maintenance actions.
  
3. The Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group should review the design of the SPTDL-150P lifeboat davit system to address the issue of the fixed davit arm flexing inward under load and potentially causing premature failure of components.
