The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that re ports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implemen ting 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.  
These reports may be reprinted in whole or in part without charge, providing acknowledgement is made 
to the Transport Accid ent Investigation Commission.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission and this report  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investiga tion organisations overseas.  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that ca n be learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.   
It would not be appropriate then to use this interim factual  report to pursue criminal, civil or regulatory 
action against any person or agency.  The Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990  makes 
this interim factual report inadmissible as evidence in any proceedings.   A full report will be released on 
completion of the inquiry.

 1. Conduct of the inquiry  
1.1. On 8 January 2011 at about  1524 the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) learnt from Maritime New Zealand that an accident had occurred earlier that 
afternoon on board the passenger ship Volendam  while berthed at Lyttelton.  
1.2. The circumstances as reported at the time were that the Volendam  had been carrying out 
lifeboat maintenan ce when the forward fall broke on one of the starboard lifeboats and 2 crew 
fell into the water.  One crew had been rescued ; the second was still missing.   
1.3. The accident fell into the category of a “very serious accident” as defined in the International 
Maritime Organization’s casualty investigation code , which requires states to conduct 
investigation s under the code .  The Commission opened an inquiry into the occurrence.  
1.4. During the night of 8 January 2011 the Commission was contacted by the Dutch Safety Board 
and an agreement was reached that the Commission would investigate the accident in its own 
right and also on behalf of the Dutch Safety Board.  An agreement was made that the 
Commission would also be the reporting authority for the accident to the In ternational Maritime 
Organization.  
1.5. On 9 January 2011, two investigators from the Commission boarded the vessel when it arrived 
in Wellington and met with the senior officers on board.  After a debrief ing with the m aster and 
senior officers the scene of the  accident was inspected and members of the crew involved in 
the accident and subsequent search and rescue were interviewed.  Access to the failed wire 
was limited as the vessel was berthed port side to the quay.  
1.6. The Volendam  sailed from Wellington the same evening and during its subsequent port stays in 
Napier, Tauranga and Auckland the failed wire fall  was removed and retained  by the 
Commission.  All the remaining wire fall s, their attachment arrangements  and the davit heads  
were inspected by a Lloyds Register Asia surveyor .   
1.7. Two lengths of wire on either side of the failure point were examined by the New Zealand 
Defence Technology Agency, on behalf of the Commission to establish the nature of the wire 
failure  
1.8. On 23 February  2011, the Commission approved an interim factual r eport for circulation to 
interested persons and urgent safety r ecommendation s to be issued to the manufacturer of 
the davit system to address safety issues  identified .

 Interim Factual Report 11 -201 2. Factual information  
2.1. Narrative  
2.1.1.  On Saturday 8 January 2011, the Dutch -registered passenger vessel Volendam  berthed  in the 
port of Lyttelton.    
2.1.2.  At about 0800 , four crew members were tasked with the routine maintenance job of greasing 
the lifeboat fall  and traveller wires  on number 7 lifeboat  on the starboard side .  The crew 
members started this job at about 0830.    
2.1.3.  Two of the crew members were standing  on the access platform, one greasing the wire fall s on 
the winch drum and one operating the controls to boom the telescopic davit in and out a nd 
lower and raise the lifeboat as required to facilitate the greasing of the wire s.   
2.1.4.  Two crew members were standing on the top of the lifeboat greasing the wire fall s and davit 
traveller wires.  They were attached , by safety harnesses , clipped to a safet y line that had 
been strung tight between the forward and aft lifeboat lifting hook arrangements.   
2.1.5.  At about 1355, the job was nearing completion.  The 2 crew members in the lifeboat 
requested the crew member at the controls to lower the lifeboat, from the lifeboat’s extreme 
height against the davit trolley arms , a small amount to allow them to finish the greasing of 
the davit traveller wire s. 
2.1.6.  As the w inch operator was lowering the lifeboat the forward lifeboat wire fall  parted and the  
lifeboat fell bow down , suspended by the aft lifeboat fall  (see F igure 1) .   
2.1.7.  The safety line rigged between the forward and aft lifting arrangements parted, and as it was 
this line to which  the crew’s safety harnesses were clipped , the 2 crew members on the 
lifeboat fell about 16 m into the water.  The crew on board the Volendam  raised the alarm and 
one of the  vessel’s rescue boat s was launched shortly afterwards . One crew member was 
rescued but t he crew member who had been at the front of the lifeboat could not be found , 
despite searches by the ship’s crew and emergency services .  Later that evening divers 
recovered his body from the seabed near where he had fallen into the sea .

 2.2. Vessel  information  
2.2.1.  The Volendam  was built by Fincantieri Shipya rd in Maghera, Italy in 1998.   The vessel was 
owned by HAL Antillen N.V. of Curacao Dutch Antillies , and operated by HAL Westours 
Incorporated of Seattle, Washington, United States of America.  The vessel was registered in 
Rotterdam, Netherlands and had valid certifi cates issued by th e Dutch Government and by the 
Lloyds Register classification society.  
2.2.2.  The Volendam  was a steel hulled passenger vessel with an overall length of 237.90 m and a 
breadth of 34.45  m.  The vessel had an international gross tonnage 61 214.  It was powered 
by five 8640 k W diesel electric generators powering two 13 000  kW electric motors driving 
two 4 -bladed variable -pitch propellers giving a service speed of up to 22.5 knots.   
2.2.3.  The Volendam  was certified to carry 620 crew and 1805 passengers.  The vessel was fitt ed 
with 14 motor lifeboats accommodating  1920 persons, 16 davit launched life  rafts 
accommodating  560 persons and 18 life  rafts not required to be launched by davits 
accommodating  630 persons.   
2.3. Lifeboat and its launching arrangement  
Davits  
2.3.1.  The davits on b oard the Volendam  were designed , manufactured  and supplied by 
Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group to the Fincantieri Shipyard .  The davits for the lifeboats 
were of SPTDL -150P design and differed from the davits for the cruise tenders and the rescue 
boats.    
2.3.2.  The S PTDL-150P davits were hydraulic telescopic davits that used hydraulic rams to move the 
telescopic trolley arms outboard from the stowed position and recover them when necessary. 
The system was designed to ensure that both davit trolley arms always mov ed together.2.  
Power was provided by 2 centralised hydraulic power packs on the port and starboard sides of 
the vessel.  The winches were designed to recover a lifeboat with  a maximum of 6 persons on 
board , not a fully loaded lifeboat . 
2.3.3.  The telescopic trolley arms of the davits were designed to support a safe working load of 86 
kilonewtons .  The telescopic trolley arms were located on guides on the inner faces of the 
fixed arms  (see Figure 2) .  To operate the davits and lower the lifeboats the lifeboat lash ings 
were  released and the telescopic trolley  arm of the davit was hydraulically pushed out to the 
fully extended position.  The lifeboat was then lowered to the embarkation deck and the davit 
arm brought back in to bring the lifeboat against the ship’s side.   
Lifeboats  
2.3.4.  The lifeboats supplied to the Volendam  were designed and manufactured by Schat Harding 
and were of the MPC 36  SV partially en closed lifeboat design ; The lifeboats were constructed 
from marine quality laminated glass fibre reinforced plastic; they ha d an overall length of 
10.8  m and a beam of 4.45  m.  The lifeboats weighed 5.45  tonnes (t) including loose gear and 
had a capacity o f 150 persons.  The lifeboat release hooks were of the Tor T12 design and 
were 9.40  m apart  in the stowed position .

 Wire falls  
2.3.5.  The lifeboat wire falls  were of 22 millimetre (mm) 6x36 wire strand construction with an 
internal wire rope core.  The wire falls  had a minimum certified  breaking strain of 
390 kilonewtons .  The forward fall was 90  m in length and the after fall was 81  m in length; 
they were man ufactured by Vornbäumen Stahlseile of Bad Iburg,  Germany.  They were 
supplied to the Volendam  in late 2005 early 2006 and fitted to number 7 davits on the 28 
November 2006.  
2.3.6.  The requirement under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 19 74 
(SOLAS) chapter III regulation 20 – operational readiness, maintenance and inspections 
paragraph 4 stated that:  
Falls used in launching shall be inspected periodically with special regard for 
areas passing through sheaves, and renewed when necessary due  to 
deterioration of the falls or at intervals of not more than 5 years, whichever is the 
earlier  
Holland America Line had designated a renewal period for lifeboat falls of 4 years  with routine 
inspections at regular intervals.  The n umber 7 forward lifebo at forward fall had  been fitted to 
the davit for more than 4 years .  The vessel’s management had noted  that the wire fall  was 
due for replacement , and on 24 November 2010,  asked  the vessel’s fleet manager whether to 
proceed or defer until the vessel dry docked in March/April 2011 when other work was to be 
carried out on the davits.  Fleet management agreed to defer the changing of the fall provided 
that “a visual inspection of th e wires was done and if the wires appeared to be in good shape 
the replacement could be deferred until dry dock”.  On 29 November a visual inspection of the 
wires was undertaken.   
Since being fitted to number 7 davit , the fall had been greased on average every six weeks by 
ship’s staff using the recommended grease .  
2.3.7.  The wire falls were wound onto 2 hydraulic ally d riven  winch drums and reeved through a 
series of sheaves located on the ship, on the telescopic trolley arms and on the fixed arm s. 
Both wire falls terminated after passing around fixed guides located on the outboard end of 
the fixed arm of the davit (see Figure 3) .

 Interim Factual Report 11 -201 2.4. Inspection and t esting  
Davit  
2.4.1.  After the accident , number 7 telescopic davit was re -housed in its stowed position with the 
fixed end of the forward wire fall  still in place.  This allowed the investigators to view the wire 
fall in place befor e it was removed.  
2.4.2.  The wire failed at a point just inboard of the fixed guide on the inside  of the forward davit arm 
(see F igures 4 and 5).  When being extended and rehoused the moving trolley arm move d 
horizontally past this fixed guide.  The groove  on the fixed guide was of sufficient size to 
accommodate  a 22  mm wire under tension.  A vertical bracket  on the moveable trolley beam 
lay adjacent to the fixed guide  when the davit was in its stowed position.   
2.4.3.  Figures 4 and 5 show where the bracket  had been rubbing  against the fixed guide , causing 
wear marks on the bracket .  When  number 5 davit was inspected , there was evidence of wire 
score marks on the bracket  (see F igure 6).   
2.4.4.  When number 5 davit was tested during the inspection, the surveyo r noted that when the 
weight of the lifeboat was taken on the falls there was an elastic deformation of the fixed davit 
arm of up to 15  mm inwards towards the moving trolley beam.  On further inspection and 
measurement the surveyor noted that the fixed dav it beam had a n inward plastic d eformation 
of about 10  mm (see F igure 7).   
Wire f all  
2.4.5.  Both parts of the broken wire  were sent to the Defence Technology Agency for independent 
examination and testing.

 2.4.6.  In the Technical M emorandum C1191 provided to the Commission by the Defence Technology 
Agency about the failure of the number 7 davit forward fall , the Defence Technology Agency 
summarised as follows:   
30. The  wire rope was formed from galvanised steel wires. Its construction 
conformed to the documents sighted.  
31. Surface wear was observed at several positions along the wire rope. Where 
present the wear did not significantly reduce the cross sectional area of  the 
strands in question. No abrasive wear was observed within the lay or strands 
of the wire rope.  
32. The failure had occurred in a severely corroded section of the hoist wire. A 
high proportion of the wires had corroded through and the corrosion had 
caused a significant reduction in the cross sectional area of other wires 
which finally failed by tensile fracture. This corrosion was associated with a 
relative absence of grease in the immediate area of the failure compared to 
that observed elsewhere.  
33. Remote from the failure zone in the hoist section of the wire rope, general 
corrosion was seen on the surface of the visible wires. Sectioning and 
inspection of one discrete point on this part of the w ire rope showed that 
only the outermost layers had been affected by corrosion which had not 
significantly reduced the cross sectional area of the wires or strand.

 Interim Factual Report 11 -201 3. Safety action s 
General  
3.1.1.  The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken to address safety issues identified by the Commission that would 
otherwise have resulted in the Commission issuing a recommendation; and  
(b) safety  actions taken to address other safety issues that would not normally have 
resulted in the Commission issuing a safety recommendation.  
3.1.2.  The following safety actions are not listed in any order of priority.  
Safety actions  addressing proposed recommendations  
(a) On 11 January 2011, Holland America Line’s Fleet Operations issued a Fleet Alert: FA 
002-11 on the subject of lifeboat davit systems – one time inspection, the purpose of 
which was to:  
conduct a one -time inspection of all lifeboat davit systems, verify th at hoisting 
wire falls are in proper condition, reiterate fall protection procedures and the use 
of personal protective equipment  
(b) On 18 January 2011, Carnival Corporation & PLC (the parent company of Holland 
America Line) issued an adv isory notice No. 02/2 011 which recommended:  
that each operating line:  
1. Inspects all lifeboat, tender and rescue boat wire falls for any 
abnormalities (fish hooks, corrosion, cuts, abrasion etc) with particular 
attention to areas where the wires may be subject to friction agains t 
fixed or moving structural components of the hoisting systems.  
2. Examines all sheaves, guides, links, hooks, thimbles and wire securing 
points of the hoisting system for any abnormalities such as corrosion 
and excessive wear and to ensure proper functional ity.  During such 
inspections the hoisting system should be moved in various positions 
as designed.  
3. Revie ws its policies and procedures covering working aloft to assess 
their adequacy, with particular emphasis to the use and maintenance 
of fall prevention devices and the related training provided to 
shipboard personnel.  
4. Assesses the adequacy of its requirements for the use of personal 
flotation devices applicable to personnel working over the ship side 
and reiterate the importance of using such devices to l ine workers 
and their supervisors.

 4. Recommendation s  
General  
4.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of  recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether the se safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to the Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti 
Group , with notice of these recommendations given to the Dutch Safety Board , Inter national 
Association of Classification Societies, Cruise  Lines International Association , and Maritime 
New Zealand.   
4.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
The following recommendations are not listed in any order of priority:  
4.1.3.  The Commission believes it is a safety issue that the design of the SPTDL -150P lifeboat davit 
does not facilitate a thoro ugh examination or effective lubrication of the standing part of the 
wire falls where they pass around the fixed guides before terminating.  Lack of effective 
lubrication in this area will promote rapid corrosion and possible premature failure of the wire 
rope fall.  Difficulty in conducting a thorough examination of the wire rope in this area could 
result in the risk of possible premature failure of the wire rope going undetected.  
4.1.4.  The Commission believes it is a further safety issue that the design of the SPTDL -150P davit 
allows the outer ends of the fixed arm to flex towards the adjacent moving trolley beam when 
the load is taken by the wire falls.  There is evidence that this flexing can cause the trolley 
beam structure to contact the wire guides, and pos sibly the wire falls, which could lead to 
excessive wear and premature failure of the wire rope.  
Recommendation 1  
It is recommended that as a matter of urgency, the Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group alert all 
owners of vessels fitted with the SPTDL -150P sto red-power telescop ic lifeboat davit s of the 
circumstances of this accident and issue instructions on what immediate inspections and 
maintenance should be carried out to prevent a failure of wire rope falls for the same or 
similar reasons.  (009/11)  
Recommendation 2  
It is recommended that as a matter of urgency , the Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group make a 
technical assessment of other lifeboat davit models it has produced to identify if similar safety 
issues exist with those models, and if so, alert o wners of those davits and issue them with 
instructions on what immediate inspections and maintenance should be carried out to prevent 
a failure of wire rope falls for the same or similar reasons.   (010/11)  
Recommendation 3  
It is recommended that as a matte r of urgency , the Navalimpianti Tecnimpianti Group review 
the design of the SPTDL -150P lifeboat davit system with a view to remedying the tendency in 
this case for the fixed davit arm to flex inwards under load and contact moving parts of the 
structure, wh ich could lead to premature failure of components within the system.   (011/11)  
A reply to the recommendations was not available at the time of printing.
