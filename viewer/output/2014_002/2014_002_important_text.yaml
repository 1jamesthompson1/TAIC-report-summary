  \ no mechanical reason for the engines ' loss of  power on the incident flight.\
  \  It \nwas determined the power losses were due to fuel starvation11. \n4.1.2.\
  \  The following analysis  discusses the circumstances leading up to and cont ributing\
  \ to the \ndouble  engine power loss .  It also discusses a number of safety issues\
  \ that directly or \nindirectly contributed to the incident : actions and omissions\
  \ by the pilot, the operator and \nthose involved in the modification of the helicopter\
  \ for night flying operations, namely:  \n\uF0B7 the pilot lacked recent experience\
  \ and training  on the aircraft  type \n\uF0B7 there was no aural warning to alert\
  \ the pilot to the potential  fuel starvation of both \nengines , which could have\
  \ prevented the loss of power  \n\uF0B7 the modification of the cockpit  lighting\
  \ adversely affe cted the readability of the  caution \nlights during day light,\
  \ when  the dimmer was on \n\uF0B7 the design of the BK117 fuel system meant that\
  \ both engines would lose power  at nearly \nthe same time if a pilot mismanaged\
  \ the fuel system and did not see the low -fuel-level  \nwarnings . \n4.2. What\
  \ happened  \n4.2.1.  Following the emergency landing the pilot stated  that the\
  \ fuel prime pumps had been switched \non and that the fuel transfer pumps had been\
  \ switched off  for the duration of the flight, and \nthese switch positions were\
  \ confirmed by the pilot on the ground .12  The prime pumps supply \nfuel under\
  \ pressure from the supply tanks to the engine during the start, then they are \n\
  switched off.  The fuel transfer pumps must  always be switched on after engine\
  \ start  and \nremain on for flight , otherwise the small supply tanks from which\
  \ the engines draw fuel will  run \ndry.  \n4.2.2.  It would have taken between\
  \ 18 and 21 minutes for the engines to exhaust  all the fuel from \nthe supply \
  \ tanks if they were not being replenished with fuel by the transfer pumps.  Both\
  \ \ntanks were  the same size and normally both engines used the same amount of\
  \ fuel, meaning \nthe engines would have lost power within  seconds  of each other.\
  \   The helicopter was about 20 \nminutes into the flight when both engines lost\
  \ power within a short space of time.   Therefore it \nis highly likely that the\
  \ pilot  had left the fuel transfer pumps  off after starting the engines .  This\
  \ \nallowed the supply tanks to run  dry, causing both engines to lose power.  \n\
  4.2.3.  A possible reason for  the pilot's  omission was his lack of r ecent experience\
  \ on the BK117 \nhelicopter.  He had almost exclusively flown the AS350  helicopter\
  \ type leading up to the \nincident flight.  The AS350 is a smaller , single -engine\
  \ helicopter made by a different \nmanufacturer, and has a simpler fuel system than\
  \ t hat of the BK117.  \n4.2.4.  The fuel system in the AS350 comprises a single\
  \ main tank with two fuel boost pumps that \nsuppl y the engine with positive pressure\
  \ at all times.  A pilot turns the boost pumps on prior to \nengine start and they\
  \ remain on for the entire flig ht.  The pilot could have inadvertently applied\
  \ \nthe more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350.  It is one explanation\
  \ for his \nleaving  the fuel prime pumps on and not turn ing the fuel transfer\
  \ pumps on.   \n4.2.5.  Inadvertently applying procedures specific to one operation\
  \ to another similar but different \noperat ion is a recognised human error .  In\
  \ the context of human factors in aviation it is \n                            \
  \                            \n11 Fuel starvation is where there is adequate fuel\
  \ on board an aircraft to run the engines, but it is unable to \nbe deli vered to\
  \ the engine, through  either a blockage or failure in the fuel system or incorrect\
  \ fuel system \nmanagement by the pilot.  \n12 This was based on the pilot's recollection\
  \ provided to the Commission.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report AO -2014 -002 sometimes\
  \ called 'negative transfer'13.  Having e xperience and  currency on the helicopter\
  \ type  \nis one way of  reducing the likelihood of it happening  (refer to section\
  \  4.5).  The use of \nchecklists is another , more reliable method . \n4.2.6. \
  \ Commercial helicopter operators are required by Civil Aviation Rules (CAR)  to\
  \ have cockpit \nchecklist s available for flight crew to use , but unlike operators\
  \ of  larger aircraft that are \ncrewed by  two pilots, they are not required to\
  \ ensure that pilots refer to  them.  It can be  \ndifficult for a single pilot\
  \ in a helicopter to refer to  a checklist during f light, because much of \nthe\
  \ time  both hands are busy manipulating the fligh t controls and cockpit switches.\
  \  However,  \nthere is no reason why  checklists cannot be referred to  during\
  \ before -flight checks , which is \nwhen  flight -critical systems and controls\
  \ are set correctly prior to departu re.    \n4.2.7.  The starting -engine checklist\
  \  for the helicopter  included promp ts for the pilot to switch off the \nfuel\
  \ prime pumps and switch on the fuel transfer pumps  after engine start .  The pilot\
  \ did not \nuse this checklist .  The use of this checklist  should hav e captured\
  \ his omission and prevented \nthe helicopter taking off with the fuel transfer\
  \ pumps switch ed off (see Appendix 1, starting \nengine check , items 14 and 20)\
  \ . \n4.2.8.  The following section discuss es why, during the subsequent 20 minutes\
  \ of flight , the pilot was \nnot alerted to the fact that the fuel transfer pumps\
  \ were not switch ed on and that the fuel \nlevel in the supply tanks was getting\
  \ dangerously low.  \n4.3. Warning and caution lights and aural warnings  \nAural\
  \ warnings  \n4.3.1.  The BK117 was not designed to have an  aural warning to alert\
  \ pilot s to low fuel levels in the \nsupply tanks.  The first aural warning the\
  \ pilot would have heard in this situation would have \nbeen the low -engine -speed\
  \ warning horn as the engine lost power due to fuel starvation.  \n4.3.2.  This\
  \ issue was addresse d in later helicopter designs that feature d additional fuel\
  \ caution \nlights to indicate reducing  fuel level s in the supply tanks , and\
  \  caution lights to indicate the \nprime pumps were on .  The fuel -low-level caution\
  \ was changed to a red warning light with an \nassociated aural warning horn  in\
  \ the later designs.  \nVisual warnings  \n4.3.3.  Like many helicopters used for\
  \ emergency medical and search and rescue flights, Z K-HJC had \nhad its cockpit\
  \ lighting m odified to ena ble a night vision imaging system  to be used .  The\
  \ \nintensity and colours of the cockpit lights and displays were changed in order\
  \ to be compatible \nwith night vision goggles14 and to avoid cockpit light interference15.\
  \  The modification involve d \ninstalling special  lights and filters that remove\
  \ d any light that was incompatible with the use of \nnight vision goggles . More\
  \ recent  modifications  have  incorporate d light-emitting diode (LED) \nwarning\
  \ and caution lights that are more efficient and easier to read when di mmed.  \n\
  4.3.4.  Prior to the night vision imaging system modification  (NVIS) , the colours\
  \ of the warning and \ncaution lights of the central annunciator panel were red\
  \ and orange respectively ; after the \nmodification they were changed to orange\
  \ and yellow.  The intensity of the lights was also \nchanged, and the caution lights\
  \ were noticeably less bright on the dim setting when compared \nwith an unmodified\
  \ lighting system  (see Appendix 2).   \n4.3.5.  Compari sons  made  between NVIS\
  \ modified and unmodified aircraft (see Appendix 2) show \nthat when dimmed,  the\
  \ unmodified annunciator panel lights  (Figures 15 and 17) are \nsignificantly brighter\
  \ than the modified lights  (Figures 6 and 11 ), and that the caution lights \n\
  \                                                        \n13 The t ransfer from\
  \ one cockpit to another  -- of differe nt design or configuration  -- of habits\
  \ or responses that \nwere appropriate in the former but are inappropriate in the\
  \ latter, thereby posing a threat to flying safety . \n(Aviat Space Environ Med.\
  \  1982 Dec;53(12):1224 -6.) \n14 Night vision goggles are n ormally a binocular\
  \ device that pilots wear over their eyes to amplify the ambient \nlight at night\
  \ and enhance vision in low light conditions . \n15 Night vision  goggles work by\
  \ amplifying light within a certain wavelength band; if cockpit lights are left\
  \ in \nthis band they will also be amplified and blind the pilot.  \nFinal report\
  \ AO -2014 -002 \n<< Page 11 >>\n are unreadable when the modified lights are dimmed.\
  \  They  also hi ghlight the variations  in the \nbrightness, colours, size of the\
  \ lettering and layout of the different installations, and that one \nof the modified\
  \ aircraft ( Figure 1 3) is brighter than  the othe r two (Figure s 6 and 11 ).\
  \ \n4.3.6.  After each helicopter was modified the lighting system was assessed\
  \ to check the brightness \nand attention -getting properties of the new lights,\
  \ and to make sure that none of the warning \nor caution lights could be confused\
  \ with ano ther one.   \n4.3.7.  The emphasis of this assessment was to ensure there\
  \ was no light interference of the night \nvision goggles , and that the pilot could\
  \ see and interpret all the lights in the cockpit at night \nwith night vision goggles\
  \ on or off.  As part of this assessment there was a test to determine if \nthe\
  \ daylight readability of the lights had been adversely affected  by the modification\
  \ .  These \nreadability and attention -getting tests were subjective , involving\
  \ representatives from t he CAA \nand the  organisation that designed  the modification\
  \ viewing the lights from the pilot's position \nin different ambient lighting conditions.\
  \  \n4.3.8.  The test procedure guidelines for assessing daylight readability state\
  \ that if the lights have \nbrightness control (a dimmer ) this test should be conducted\
  \ at various settings.  H owever , in \npractice this test is not normally done\
  \ with the dimmer on, the rationale being  that the pilot is \nunlikely to dim the\
  \ lights during the day .  While it might not be normal practice to select the \n\
  dimmer switch on in daylight conditions, there is a risk that the dimmer switch\
  \ could be  left on \ninadvertently.  In this case the pilot had conducted his pre\
  \ -flight and before -start procedures \nat Christch urch in the early morning around\
  \ dawn, and had turned the dimmer on.  He  had \nsubsequently forgot ten to turn\
  \ the dimmer off for the daylight flight from Ashburton.  \n4.3.9.  With reference\
  \ to the use of checklists discussed in the previous section, if the pilot had u\
  \ sed \nthe checklist s he would have been instructed  to check that the dimmer\
  \ was off (see Appendix \n1, cockpit  check, item 17) and check the annunciator\
  \ panel lights  (before -starting engine \ncheck, items 5, 10 and 17 ).  However,\
  \ the use of written checklists for the helicopter was not \nmandat ory, and the\
  \ risk of a pilot leaving the dimmer on during daylight  remained .   \n4.3.10.\
  \  Therefore  the assessment of the night vision imaging system modification was\
  \ not conducted \nin accordance with the test procedure guidelines , because the\
  \ system was not assessed for \ndaylight readability  at various dimmer control\
  \ settings.  \n4.3.11.  Figures 5 and 6 are photographs  of the modified central\
  \ annunciator panel lights of the \nhelicopter.  Figure 5 shows  the light dimmer\
  \ switch off an d the lights on full brightness.  Figure \n6 shows  the same lights\
  \ illuminated but with the dimmer switch on.  It is clear that in daylight \nconditions\
  \ with the dimmer switch on, the illuminated yellow caution lights are almost \n\
  impossible  to see.  \n4.3.12.  Consequently, the two cautio n lights on the central\
  \ annunciator panel that should have alerted \nthe pilot to the fact he had forgotten\
  \ to turn  on the fuel transfer pumps at Ashburton would \nhave been  very difficult\
  \  to see.  To emphasis e this point, during the first flight from \nChristch urch\
  \ to Ashburton  shortly after dawn,  the pilot did notice  the yellow caution light\
  \ that \ncame on for the rear door  fault .   \n4.3.13.  The first flight was longer\
  \ in duration and was successfully completed without a fuel starvation \nevent,\
  \ which suggests the pilot either remembered to turn the fuel transfer pumps on\
  \ after \nengine start or noticed  that the fuel transfer pump caution lights  were\
  \ on  some  time during \nthe first flight  and turned the transfer pumps on . \
  \ However, he did not notice  during the return \nflight , in brighter ambient light,\
  \ the illuminated caution lights  for the fuel transfer pumps that \nindicated they\
  \ were not switched on . \n4.3.14.  The fuel -low-level caution lights were successfully\
  \ tested after the incident and should have \nilluminated when there was around\
  \ 23  kg of fuel remaining in each supply tank, but due to the \ndimmer setting\
  \ and the lack of an associated aural warning they wer e not detected by the pilot\
  \  \nduring the return  flight .  Had the pilot monitored the fuel levels in the\
  \ supply tanks during the \nflight, he would have noticed  that the levels were\
  \ decreasing, which would have warned him \nthat fuel was not being transferred\
  \ fro m the main tanks into the supply tanks.  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report\
  \ AO -2014 -002 4.3.15.  There had been two other incidents involving engine failures\
  \ in BK117s that occurred in \nsimilar circumstances.  One occurred in New Zealand\
  \ in 201 1 when a helicopter had an \nengine failure during a lifting operation,\
  \ but landed safely.  The other happened in the United \nStates in 200116 when a\
  \ BK117 operating a medical evacuation flight had double engine \nfailure and crashed.\
  \  In both cases the helicopte rs had been used at night or during the early \n\
  morning prior to the incident, and the cockpit lighting dimmer switch es had been\
  \ left on for \nthe subsequent flight s in daylight conditions.  It was also confirmed\
  \ in one case, and \nsuspected in the other, that t he fuel transfer pumps had been\
  \ left off for the flight, causing \nfuel starvation.  \n \n \nFigure 5  \nHJC a\

  \ panel dimmer on  \n4.4. Fuel system design  \n4.4.1.  A pilot usually  takes between\
  \ four and six  seconds17 to recognise that an engine failure has \noccurred, and\
  \ much longer to determine why it has happened. This delay did not allow enough\
  \ \ntime in this case  for the pilot to detect and correct  the fuel transfer pump\
  \ switch positions \nbefore the second engine lost power.  At this stage it was\
  \ unlikely that power from either \nengine could be restored immediately  due to\
  \ the interruption of fuel flow and the air being \ndrawn into the engines' fuel\
  \ sys tem.  If this series of events had happened at a low altitude \nthe only option\
  \ would have been to carry out an autorotation.   \n4.4.2.  Later helicopter designs\
  \ that were developed from the BK117 incorporated fuel supply tanks \nof different\
  \ capacities.  This meant that in helicopters such as the EC13518, if the transfer\
  \ \npumps were inadvertently left off, one engine would lose power at least a minute\
  \ before the \nother.  This would leave the pilot with one engine running and more\
  \ time to recognise what the \nproblem was and to recover the situation by turning\
  \ the transfer pumps on before the second \nengine lost power.  \n4.5. Pilot training\
  \ , competency  and currency on aircraft type  \n4.5.1.  The operator was required\
  \ to comply with CAR Part 13519, and it was therefor e incum bent on \nit to ensure\
  \  that each crew member was adequately trained and was current and proficient in\
  \ \neach aircraft  type and operation in which the crew member served .  The CAR\
  \ required the \noperator to  maintain a flight crew training programme that included\
  \ ongoing recurr ent training \non the aircraft type s to be used , along with a\
  \ crew member competency programme to ensure \ncontinual proficiency.  As part of\
  \ these ongoing prog rammes, each pilot had to pass  a \ncompetency check flight\
  \ in the preceding  12 months in one of the aircraft types normally flown \n   \
  \                                                     \n17 Flight Safety Foundation,\
  \ heli copter safety, 1999.  \n18 The EC135 was a twin -engine helicopter that had\
  \ a similar fuel tank arrangement, which first flew in 1994.  \n19 Part 135 in the\
  \ CAR covered commercial operations for all helicopters, and small aeroplanes with\
  \ nine \npassenger seats or weighing less than 5,700 kg.  \n\n\n<< Page 14 >>\n\
  \ Final report AO -2014 -002 by the pilot .  Each pilot  also had to have successfully\
  \ completed a n annual  written or oral test \nof their knowledge of the systems\
  \ , performance and operating procedures for each aircraft \ntype currently flown\
  \ by the pilot.  \n4.5.2.  It was  normal and accepted practice for operators to\
  \ conduct  the annual competency check \nflight s on one type of  aircraft  on a\
  \ certain operation or route, then rotate types and operations  \neach year so that\
  \ pilots were  tested in different type s and on different route s, to ensure \n\
  proficiency on all types of aircraft and operations.  However, the pilot in volved\
  \ in this incident \nhad not been tested or checked in this way, and according to\
  \ his training records had not \nbeen assessed for his aircraft type knowledge or\
  \ checked for competency on the BK117 since \n2009.   Most of  his annual recurrent\
  \ training and competency checks during this period had \nbeen carried out on the\
  \ AS350 type of helicopter.  \n4.5.3.  Pilots were required to be legally current\
  \ in the aircraft type if they were to fly passenger or any \nother commercial operations.\
  \  The currency requirement under CAR Part 6120 was for pilots to \nmake three take\
  \ -offs and landings within the preceding 90 -day period on the type of aircraft\
  \  to \nbe used.  This was the minimum requirement for any aircraft type  and for\
  \ all pilots.  It was \ncommon for  operators to require a higher level of currency\
  \ for their pilots of commercial \noperations, and if pilot s did not meet these\
  \ higher threshold s, recurrent training or supervision \nwas no rmally required\
  \ to regain competency on the type . \n4.5.4.  The operator in this case did not\
  \ have any additional requirements or procedures above or \nbeyond the legal currency\
  \ required under CAR Part 61.  A review of the pilots  logbook revealed \nthat in\
  \ the three yea rs preceding the incident he had flown the BK117 type on five occasions\
  \ \nwithout having met the se currency requirements.  \n4.5.5.  The pilot had logged\
  \ less th an 15 hours on the BK117 since October 2010, and prior to the \nflight\
  \ the day before the incident  the pilot h ad flown it once in January 2014, once\
  \ in June \n2013 and before that in September 2012.  Despite the lack of recent\
  \ experience on the  \nBK117 , no additional training or check  flights  had been\
  \ carried out on the type  with the pilot \nduring this period . \n4.5.6.  A pilot's\
  \ knowledge , experience , proficiency and currency  on an aircraft type are key\
  \ factor s in \nsafe operation s.  Meeting  the minimum requirements set out in\
  \ the CAR , and following robust \ncompany procedures that ensur e pilots are adequately\
  \ trained and current o n an aircraft type , \nare important f actors in  maintaining\
  \ pilot competency within an organisation.  \n4.6. Organisational factors  \n4.6.1.\
  \  The operator was authorised by the CAA to carry out commercial helicopter and\
  \ fixed -wing \nflights under CA R Part 135, and to operate fro m bases at Christchurch,\
  \ Greymouth and \nNelson.  The operator was also affiliated with sister helicopter\
  \ charter companies in Vanuatu \nand Fiji.  The types of operations carried out\
  \ included general charter work such as scenic \nflight s, air transport, commerc\
  \ ial work and lifting, as well as search and rescue, medical \ntransfers and flight\
  \ training.  Pilots rotated around the New Zealand and overseas bases as \nneeded,\
  \ and worked under different managers on a regular basis.  \n4.6.2.  The operator\
  \ used  five different types o f helicopter, and many of the pilots flew more than\
  \ one  \naircraft type during their employment.  Several pilots were flying multiple\
  \ types on different \noperations on a regular basis, while some flew mainly one\
  \ type with occasional flying on other \ntypes.  Th e pilot involved in this incident\
  \ was rated on all aircraft types used by the operator, \nand at the time of the\
  \ incident was approved to carry out commercial operations in four of \nthem.  However,\
  \  the majority of his flying had been carried out using the AS3 50 helicopter on\
  \ \ndaytime commercial and air transport operations.  He did not regularly fly the\
  \ BK117 type, and \nwas only required to fly it when none  of the t hree  full-time\
  \ BK117 pilots was available.  \n4.6.3.  The company  had seven senior people responsible\
  \ for crew training, flight operations, \ncompetency assessment  and quality management.\
  \  For the helicopter fleet, the flight \noperations manager and training manager\
  \ were both current BK117 pilots who did most of \n                            \
  \                            \n20 Part 61 of the CAR covered pilot licences and\
  \ ratings.  \nFinal report AO -2014 -002 \n<< Page 15 >>\n the flying  on the type\
  \ for the company.  The training  manager had not conducted any check or \ntraining\
  \ with the  pilot on the BK117, and  did not regularly fly with him.  The competency\
  \ \nmanager , who was also the chief pilot , did not conduct the competency checks\
  \ for th e \noperator , and did not regularly fly with all the pilots who flew the\
  \ BK117.  He was , however, \ntogether with the operations manager and the training\
  \ manager,  responsible for ma intaining  \nthe currency and competenc y of all\
  \ pilots.   \n4.6.4.  The shared  delegation of  training and competency responsibilities\
  \ between t hree  managers  \nmade it harder for the operator to ensure  that all\
  \ training and competency requirements under  \nCAR Part 13 5 were being met.  These\
  \ responsibilities are traditionally  held by one person, a \ntraining manager,\
  \ who controls the pilots'  annual recurrent training program me and \ncompetency\
  \ checks and is normally a line pilot who flies with the pilots.  It is easier for\
  \ a \ntraining manager who flies with the pilots, maintains th e training records\
  \ and conducts  the \ncompetency checks to maintain oversight of all pilots' proficiency\
  \ and curren cy. \n4.6.5.  It was unclear from the company operations manual and\
  \ check and training manual who \nwithin the company was ultimately responsible\
  \ for ensur ing that all pilots were adequately \ntrained, current and competent.\
  \  The duplication and overlapping of responsibilities meant \nthere was no clear\
  \ delineation of duties.  This management arrangement made it difficult to \nwork\
  \ together cohesively to mainta in an effective oversight of pilot currency and\
  \ competency.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>"
