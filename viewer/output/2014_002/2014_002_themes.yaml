- name: Fuel Management
  explanation: Fuel management is a critical aspect of aircraft operation, ensuring that engines receive a continuous supply of fuel. In this accident, the engines lost power due to fuel starvation, which occurred because "the pilot did not switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines" (5.1). The pilot's omission was likely due to his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter, as he had "almost exclusively flown the AS350 helicopter type leading up to the incident flight" (4.2.3). The AS350 has a simpler fuel system, which may have led to the pilot inadvertently applying the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350 to the BK117 (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because proper fuel management could have prevented the engines from losing power and the subsequent incident.
- name: Pilot Training and Currency
  explanation: Pilot training and currency are essential for ensuring that pilots are proficient in operating the specific aircraft types they fly. In this case, the pilot "had not been assessed for his type-specific knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 in the previous five years" (5.2), and he "lacked recent experience on the aircraft type" (5.2). The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that this pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117 (5.3). This theme is relevant because the pilot's lack of recent experience and training on the BK117 contributed to the incorrect fuel system management that led to the incident.
- name: Use of Checklists
  explanation: The use of checklists is a standard safety practice in aviation to ensure that all necessary procedures are followed. In this incident, the pilot did not use the starting-engine checklist, which would have prompted him to "switch off the fuel prime pumps and switch on the fuel transfer pumps after engine start" (4.2.7). The operator did not require pilots to refer to written checklists if they lacked recent experience on an aircraft type (5.6). This theme is relevant because adherence to the checklist could have captured the pilot's omission and prevented the helicopter from taking off with the fuel transfer pumps switched off, thereby preventing the fuel starvation.
- name: Cockpit Lighting and Warning Systems
  explanation: Cockpit lighting and warning systems are designed to alert pilots to potential issues that require immediate attention. In this accident, a cockpit lighting modification "adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, when the dimmer switch was on" (5.4). Additionally, the helicopter was not designed to generate an aural warning of a critically low fuel level in the supply tanks (5.5). This theme is relevant because if the caution lights had been visible and an aural warning had been present, they could have alerted the pilot to the incorrectly configured fuel system and the low fuel levels, potentially preventing the incident.
- name: Organisational Oversight
  explanation: Organisational oversight refers to the systems and processes that an operator has in place to ensure the safety and proficiency of its operations and personnel. In this case, the operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was found lacking (5.3). The shared delegation of training and competency responsibilities between three managers made it harder for the operator to ensure that all training and competency requirements were being met (4.6.4). This theme is relevant because the lack of clear delineation of duties and effective oversight contributed to the pilot not being adequately trained or current on the BK117, which was a factor in the incident.
- name: Aircraft Design and Safety Features
  explanation: Aircraft design and safety features play a significant role in preventing accidents. The design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if the fuel system was mismanaged (4.1.2). Later helicopter designs incorporated different capacities for fuel supply tanks, allowing more time for pilots to recognize and correct issues before both engines lost power (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the design of the BK117's fuel system contributed to the rapid loss of power in both engines, leaving the pilot with little time to react, which was a factor in the incident.
